STEPHEN PORGES And let me first introduce, uh… you know, I'll tell you what the session is. The session is the new era of brain based physiotherapy, energy psychology and brainspotting under the microscope. I'm the moderator. I'm Stephen Porges. And we have two, uh… very, very, uh… I'll tell you he's kind of accomplished and bold and uh… pioneers in their areas. And before I even started talking too much, let me tell you a little about who our speakers are. We have David Feinstein, there he is, who'll be the first speaker, and he is a clinical psychologist. He spokes on consciousness and healing, had been translated into 15 languages and won several awards. Umm… he and his wife Donna Eden had built the world's largest organization, teaching Energy Medicine. And David, before he moved into Energy Medicine, he was a community psychologist, if I get this one right, and was at, at Johns Hopkins University and the School of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry. And the second speaker will be David Grand. David is a psychotherapist and the developer of Brainspotting, a brain body relational therapy, which is growing internationally with 9,000 therapists and 30 trainers internationally. He's written, uh… uh… three books. One is called "Brainspotting, the Revolutionary New Therapy for Rapid and Effective Change," uh… another one was "This is Your Brain on Sports" and the third one is "Emotional Healing at Warp Speed". He has a private practice in Manhattan for Psychotherapy and he's also been, uh… interviewed and on TV several times. But before I actually start, uh… doing, uh… giving the perspective that I want you to have in this, I want you to tell you, I want to tell you that, this is, uh… a very interesting opportunity for you and also for me. And we got together, this is the first time we've met each other. And, first time the two Davids' have met each other. And we had a very nice sort of interactions. And one thing I was trying to convey to them was that I am, you know, I'm a, I'm a university professor. I'm a researcher, these are my credentials but I'm not, uh… as bold as these two gentlemen in terms of developing a novel intervention's that, uh… our, that I was tremendously, if you watch the videos which they will show, having tremendous impact on human behavior. And what I explain to them is my contribution to this innovative program is to point out the behavioral and biological states that the people are changing during their therapy. So I developed a theory that's called "Polyvagal Theory." It's based on the evolution of the autonomic nervous system in vertebrates. And it explains a lot of behavioral state changes, especially those that are associated with trauma. So I gave, uh… our presenters a sort of challenges. I basically asked them to talk about the history of their, uh… quest, their, their uh… technique, the methodology, what they were trying to accomplish with it, and then I wanted them to go and show a variety of examples, uh… using videos. And I also explain to them that I have a tendency to interrupt and because what I enjoy is to deconstruct, uh… the wonderful work that clinicians do because that's how I learned and that's how inform clinicians about underlying mechanisms of what they are doing. In the sense, what I want to emphasis is that their features in the face and in the motor movement, in the posture of the individuals that they are working with. There are powerful clues that they are intuitively picking up on as they do their interventions. And that they are literally doing a masterful job in shifting autonomic state and behavioral state that will enable the individuals to resolve certain features of their trauma and they will explain that. As a back ground, I decided, I would provide a few quick slides to try to emphasis the points. And that is, when people are in physiological states, the physiological state is functionally an intervening variable. So how many of you took introductory psychology? Okay. Remember the word, intervening variable, okay? Now it's something that we tend to forget overtime but it means something between the impotent and the stimulus and the response. And what that is and of course, mostly you work with trauma. The intervening variable that is critical is the physiological state that the individual was in. Because based on that physiological state, if they are in states of, of safety, they process information well, if they are in states of danger, they are reactive and they distort what you're saying and they see neutral things as being negative. We are all familiar with that. We do have spouses and insignificant others, so we know that feature. And we also, uh… know that when people are literally shutdown, communication is really very, very limited. So the Polyvagal Theory basically says, that our nervous system evaluates risk in the environment, and it does that your process is outside the realm of awareness that we're calling Neuroception. That information, that decision making on the brain, in the brain and relatively high levels, but outside of consciousness, shifts are physiological state, and it shifts it into a state of safety, which is regulated by a, a vagal pathway that facilitates calmness and enables the face to work. And as therapist, you look at people's faces usually, right? And if the faces look alive, there's animation, the upper part of the face is working, that is due to the individual being in the physiological state. You can also hear in their voice the physiological state. So the prosodic features are also regulated by another vagal pathway. So we know that when people are in state of safety, they are animated, they are engaging, their posture ships, facial expression, and physiologically they are calmer. But the nervous system detects danger, and part of the therapies often are for people to visualize or to think or to go back to a memory, and the physiological state will change and that will support more mobilization, tensing in the hands, loss of expression to the upper part of the face, sometimes even showing teeth and the lower part of the face pushing out and the hands may get clenched. If, if they're in a state of life threat, there's collapse and you're often working in the bounce point before, between being mobilized and people falling apart or collapsing. Uh… I want you to look at these features because if you look at the upper part of the face, let's hope, yeah. You see, the orbital, uh… muscle around the eye, it's called the Orbicularis Oculi. You'll never look at a face again without thinking orbicularis oculi. Because everything is going to be conveyed in the upper part of the face and that's regulated by an area the brain send us, also linked to the regulation of autonomic state. So when people are calm and happy, you see in the upper part of their face and you hear it in their voice. And this is a way of, again thinking of the hierarchy of how people respond when they are using their head, uh… higher little parts of the brain, enable social communication, they're calm. When they lose their head, they become dependent on limbs, they fight-or-flight, and they mobilize and this is through a sympathetic or uh… mobilization, you know, this is fight-or-flight. And if they experience life threat, they can immobilize and use an older vagal circuit. So this, for those of you, you're familiar with Polyvagal Theory, VVC is ventral vagal complex sympathetic nervous system and dorsal vagal. And the dorsal vagal regulates organs below the diaphragm. And you'll understand that with many people with trauma, where are the symptoms manifested? And what Polyvagal theory leads to and you can use this to deconstruct. Many of the features of the Taxol will follow, is that the therapist creates through their prosodic voices, they're being present, their posture, their facial expressivity, they trigger in the client. The clients Neuroception of safety, that enables the nervous system then to process the intervention. So interventions become functionally neural exercises, when the physiological state can support it with positive outcomes. And so this is the final slide and this is how I deconstruct the, uh… processes involved in trauma therapies. First is that, you have to experience the therapy in a safe context, and this means the nervous system with that safety, removes threat, uh… and you now, to do that, you have to remove Predator Cues. This means your clinic sites can't have low frequency rumble, it can't even have a, uh… the sound of escalators or trucks or even ventilation systems can trigger, uh… in the nervous system a sense of predator and interfere with your ability to generate, uh… change. And by adding acoustic cues like a mother's, uh… prosodic voice, you can calm patients, calm individuals. And what I often say is, we do very well with our infants, we do very well with our dogs and cats, we do very poorly with our peers and our spouses and our children as they get older. Which means we don't understand the importance of the cues of safety, once we become a uh…a, a species that uses language. Once we use language we forget about the implicit bodily responses to intonation. And therapy from a polyvagal perspective is really neural exercises moving between, uh… bio-behavioral states. In general, moving between mobilization by re… to safety by re-engaging that vagal structures, and you will see that in the face of the clients in the videos. And when we become explicitly aware of these implicit subjective experiences associated with each behavioral state change, then we start creating, uh… and understand them that these, these exercises, uh… can enable us to regulate our state and we become more secure and more resilient. And as we develop, uh… a personal narrative that explains now what those implicit biological states mean and feel, we can start developing neural expectancies of competence, resilience, and safety. With that I'm done and I hope I have set the stage for David to, uh… introduce his work. Thank you. 

00:11:15
DAVID FEINSTEIN There you go. 

00:11:15
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah. 

00:11:20
[sil.] 

00:11:40
David Feinstein, Ph. D. 

00:11:40
DAVID FEINSTEIN So I'm really thrilled to have the opportunity to explore this topic in this forum. So thank you for being here. Umm…. because time has really limited. I'm going to stay very much with the slide. So I'm going to, umm… go rather fast until we get to the videos, which I think will really make the concepts that I cover now a lot more alive. Umm… Energy Psychology is an umbrella term for more than 30 branded approaches that all share… If… Can… Can somebody… Oh, okay. I think… Yeah, I'm talking through this one. Video, close the wrap. Is that better? No. 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
STEPHEN PORGES Another role. Can you talk now? 

00:12:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN Thank you. Can you hear me better now? Yes, in the back? Okay. I have to… 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Speak louder. 

00:13:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN I have to speak louder, okay. And if he get… Okay, I'll, I'll try to speak louder and umm… may be an AV person can also increase the volume. Okay. So starting again. Energy psychology is an umbrella term for more than 30 branded approaches that all share two features. First, each has the client physiologically activate or in plain terms, bring to mind. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN What? 

00:13:35
DAVID FEINSTEIN Bring to mind. Okay. Bring it to mind is physiologically activated, a traumatic or other difficult memory or a trigger for an unwanted physiological, emotional or behavioral response or images reaching a goal or another desired outcome. Second, each approach simultaneously or nearly simultaneously stimulates a code energy system, often borrowing constructs and techniques from ancient healing and spiritual systems, such as the chakras of yoga and umm… vedic traditions, the aura that is described in so many religious texts but now, is now being studied as the bio-field by scientists with ingredients in acupuncture points from classical Chinese medicine. The most well known and best researched of these approaches are Thought Fuel Therapy or TFT and it's extremely popular derivative emotional freedom techniques, which is the other EFT, not to be confused with Sue Johnson's brilliant Emotionally Focused Therapy. Both TFT and Energy Psychologies, EFT, stimulate selected acupuncture points by tapping on them. The potential psychological impact of tapping on acupuncture points was discovered in the early 1980s, more or less accidentally by Roger Callahan, a clinical psychologist. Callahan was treating a woman who had a severe fear of water, to the extent that she would go into an anxiety attack if it was raining. She couldn't bath in a full tub of water. She had nightmares about water. Her family could not remember a time even back into early childhood when she didn't have this fear. And Callahan was making virtually no progress with her. Now independently, he had from his own personal interest been studying a form of acupressure. And to make things more difficult with this woman, Callahan had a home office and he had a swimming pool. So the woman had to walk by the swimming pool to get his office. So she come in partially traumatized for every session and part of that was nausea. So Callahan got the idea of having her tap on stomach, stomach one, which is the first point on Stomach Meridian. And almost instantly her nausea went away and Stomach Meridian is also however associated with worry and related emotions. And very quickly this surprise look comes on her face and she says, "I'm not afraid of water anymore." She goes out to the pool, she splashes water on her face. That evening they were in a coastal town, it was raining. She drove to the beach, walked into the water and they followed her for 30 years, it never returned. Now this did not escape Callahan's notice. And so what he did was to begin experimenting with other acupuncture points for other conditions and he developed a system so that by uh… 1985 he had published "The Five Minute Phobia Cure." You can imagine how the psychotherapy field received that. "The Five Minute Phobia Cure," he had taken to the radio talk show circuit and generally created a hot bed of controversy. By 2001, the following body of peer-reviewed research demonstrating the efficacy of his approach was available. Yes. Commentary could have however be found in clinical journals. Even the distinguished Richard McNally of Harvard wade in. He wrote in the journal of clinical psychology, after obtaining a TFT protocol for treating phobic fear, fear, we wondered whether TFT was a hoax concocted by some clever prankster to spoof fringe therap… fringe therapies and he goes on. Lacking any credible fury or convincing data, TFT therapies nevertheless continue to tell their patients how to tap and hum their troubles away. Rich Simon coached me when I was writing an article about Energy Psychology for the magazine that I had to deal with the negative impressions left on the clinical community by the early proponents of the method. He said, "Even though you don't care a second chance to make a first impression, you can at least deal with the first impressions that have been made." Now sometimes a picture sums it up. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:19:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN Now the first impressions were actually fair enough given, how strange the method looks, the lack of a coherent explanation for why it might work and the zealous public claims despite no research support. So what do we know now 15 years after McNally's, and most of the field's initial assessment? More than 30 randomized clinical trials have been published, some in prominent journals. These are all American psychological journals I've carried, randomized clinical trials. The journal of Nervous and mental disease is the oldest Mental Health Journal on the planet, established in 1874 and its current editor is a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. So it's a conservative journal and they have carried two clinical trials of Acupoint Tapping protocols and two review papers, all quite affirming of the approach. About six years ago, the field established its own peer-reviewed journal. And in addition to the clinical trials that have been (inaudible )formed meta-analyses and they have been conducted on subsets of the existing studies. And what they show is large effect size. This is in treating anxiety and PTSD. And moderate effect sizes in treating depression. Now this is also what you'll find for cognitive behavior therapy. But, but there are hundreds of studies of CBT with an amazing 250 plus meta-analyses or other quantitative reviews. So how strong is the energy psychology research compared to cognitive behavioral therapy, it's still in relatively embryonic stage. Most of the studies had no institutional support or funding or conducted by proponents of the method and didn't exactly used the most stringent research standards. However, most still met the minimum criteria for the APA's clinical psychology division for studies that establish efficacy. Most pointed in the same direction, showing very rapid outcomes with strong effect sizes. And recent more stringently designed studies are cooperating rather than refuting the earlier studies that were less well-designed. For understanding what Acupoint Tapping is, a distinction should be made that, rather than being another form of psycho-therapy, it's best viewed as a free-standing Somatic Intervention like a breathing technique or like progressively relaxation, although this one has a special ability as you see for enhancing information processing in very precise ways. A recent survey of the association for comprehensive energy psychologies membership show that, nearly two-third's of the license mental health professionals, either people who are identifying with energy psychology by joining the organization, considered an adjunct to their primary approach. It is not their primary approach. And in fact, it fits very well into most clinical frameworks and as well as into most theoretical frameworks. Today, the three of us have been invited to explore the neurological mechanisms that underlie the documented outcomes of two approaches that I think it is fair to say, for outside the box of conventional clinical treatment. Dr. Porges will be showing how along with other actions, a range of clinical interventions promote the experience in neuron-chemistry of safety and the neurological and psychological consequences of that shift. These processes certainly operate with Acupoint Tapping protocols. But acupoint protocols also have special strings for facilitating two of the most critical neurological processes for therapeutic change. Which are limbic system deactivation and memory reconsolidation. I believe in fact that the overriding contribution of acupoint stimulation protocols is in their ability to eradicate old neural pathways and establish new ones through their speed and power for facilitating limbic system deactivation and for memory reconsolidation. So the reminders of my remarks are going to focus on these two processes. So you know what to look for when you see the video demonstrations. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:10
DAVID FEINSTEIN Limbic system deactivation is of course part of any effective therapy that deal with trauma. Acupoint Tapping protocols turn out to be particularly good at it. What happens is that a traumatic memory or trigger, by bringing it to mind, it initiates a threat response in the lateral nucleus of the amygdale. The limbic system is activated. At the same time, stimulating selected acupuncture point sends signals to the amygdale that reduce the threat response. So you have the brain getting opposing messages, contradicting messages. And what happens is, if you keep tapping for just a little while, the body, the brain notices that you wouldn't be tapping on your skin, if a saber-toothed tiger just walked into the cave. And so there is a reduction and arousal even while the harmless but previously threatening image or memory or trigger is mentally activated. So you bring it down very quickly. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:35
DAVID FEINSTEIN So stimulating selected acupuncture points sends electro-magnetic signals through the connective tissue. And that's very important because the connective tissue is made largely of collagen. And collagen is a semiconductor. So that means that the electrical signal that comes from the acupuncture points which have unique electro-chemical properties get sent instantly, uh… across, rather than the process of going of the signals getting transmitted from cell to cell to cell to cell, which is lot slower and also there is a loss of signal strength. So you have to go very quickly and umm… as a result, the reduction in the amygdale arousal is almost instant. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:30
DAVID FEINSTEIN Now how do we know this? This does not come from Energy Psychology Research. It's actually a 10 year uh… research program at Harvard Medical School looking at the effects, the physiological effects of stimulating different acupuncture points using FMRI, PET scans and other imaging devices. And that's one of their findings, one of their strong findings is that limbic system arousal is decreased. A criticism of the early energy psychology research was that the observed outcomes might have been due to placebo or other Parts of the protocol. Six studies now have investigated the active ingredients by removing various components. In five of the six, the acupoint tapping was shown to be an essential ingredient for the strength of the outcomes and the six was inconclusive. In two of them, new identical protocols were compared, with the only difference being, umm… one of them, they tapped on actual acupuncture points and the other one they tapped on points that are not known acupuncture points. And they compared the two sets and, and uh… both groups did show statistically improvement. The improvement was statistically, umm… significant but the difference between the two groups show that the actual acupuncture points were statistically superior to the sham points. It's rather very important study for understanding what is going on. Now the second critical ingredient for neurological change is memory reconsolidation. And to understand memory reconsolidation, we first have to look at memory consolidation or how memories are formed. You have an emotionally charged experience in childhood. Within seconds, it's stored in working memory, within minutes, it's stored in short-term memory and within hours of more, it is integrated into long-term memory. Working memory enquires the establishment of new neural pathways. Short-term memory requires that but also it is hippocampus mediated. Long term memory is mediated by the neocortex as well as the hippocampus. So this is how an experience becomes consolidated as a memory. The consolidated memory is integrated within the cognitive system as a constellation. Okay, what that means is first you have the content of the remembered experience or more precisely the experience as it is remembered. But along with that, you also have emotional reactions, you have behavioral responses, you have bodily sensations, you have safety assessment, you have perceptual filters, you have self appraisal. So a memory is much more than it's content. It's also a constellation of associated physiological emotional cognitive and behavioral elements. Most memories are coherent and relatively well-integrated. But traumatic memories maybe stored in fragments. And those fragments can emerge and impact current perceptions and behavior with no conscious recognition of their origin. So you have a fear that you don't know where it comes from, it's actually because the person you're with right now has long eyebrows and those long eyebrows remind you of somebody that had been abusive to you. And so you have that reaction to this person, you have no idea where it came from. But whether the memory is fragmented or well-integrated, emotionally charged learning's are maintained by extraordinarily durable synapses. They don't change easily. However, nature is developed two ways to alter this constellation. You're familiar with the extinction from exposure therapy or those of you that took psycho one-on-one, remember that what extinction is. Memory reconsolidation is relatively recent construct with the pioneering work going back only to the 1990s and the implications for psychotherapy being examined only within last decade. To briefly review the mechanisms of extinction in both nature and exposure therapy, are harmless trigger that lists it fear presented enough times with no negative consequences, eventually loses its capacity to elicit a learned threat response. Extinction over rises, over rise but does not eliminate the, old, the learn, old learning, it's very important, you'll see why in a moment. For instance, if the old emotionally charged learning is, all heights are dangerous. Extinction suppresses the old learning, allowing a new learning to dominate, such as heights aren't necessarily dangerous. But since the old learning is only suppressed, it remains neurologically intact. How do we know that? In both animal studies and clinical trials with human subjects, certain conditions were reverse extinction causing the old learning to return. So it was never eradicated, it's always there invading. Even after it's been apparently eliminated by extinction. So ways that, that happens are, the trigger is presented outside the treatment context, an event similar to the original traumatic memory occurs unexpectedly. Stress can, increase stress in the person's life can cause the old memory to return. Sometimes simply, simply the passage of time, but all of these demonstrated the therapy did not eliminate the neural pathways that had maintained the symptom. To completely and permanently eliminate the neural pathways that maintain psychological symptoms for the pathways to be depotentiated, the process of memory reconsolidation must occur. This is true for all therapies that have reliable lasting outcomes, but the therapist does not need to be aware of that. It's happening behind the scenes in the brain. Memory reconsolidation eliminates rather than overrides the old learning and it can, with skill be facilitated much more rapidly than extinction. So let's look at how memory reconsolidation works. The brain is a storage house of inactive memory constellations, any of which can be activated by attention or a wide variety of proms. Making active, making it active and labile for change. It's… Now active, it can change. Most often it evokes a strong emotional reaction such as fear. If, if it does that, it doesn't change it, it reinforces it. So it stays intact or even, might even be strengthened. However, if new competing information is introduced, during, what is called the reconsolidation window. The memory constellation can be altered. And the altering of a memory by retrieving it and introducing competing information is called memory reconsolidation. This is the key to producing neurological change in an established memory. Constellation, it's neuroplasticity in motion. The altered memory constellation has all the elements of the original that we saw before. But some content or associations have changed. Often the traumatized individuals, the psychotherapeutic change is that, they remembered experience or reminders of it, do not any longer trigger a threat response. So back to the height phobia, how does that… How does memory reconsolidation work there? All heights are dangerous. This is, we've seen is maintained by extraordinary endurable synopsis but it can be eradicated, depotentiated through memory reconsolidation. The neural pathways for the old learning, no longer exist. And they can be replaced by a new endurable learning such as heights are not necessarily dangerous. There are three essential conditions for memory consolidation to occur. The old memory must be emotionally activated. A second vivid experience must be introduced. This is the important part, which differs significantly from what the old learning expects and predicts about how the world functions. And that's the critical part and it's called variously the contradicting or disconfirming or just a position or emotionally corrective experience. Finally, vivid experiences that challenge the old learning, point two, must occur several times. So the first part prepares the old learning for the possibility of change, the second bio-chemically unlock the synopsis that maintain the old learning and umm… the therapy replaces the old learning, literally eradicating and establishing the emotional corrective experience as a new emotional learning. How do acupoint protocols do this? Returning to the three requirements. This is easy enough for any therapy to activate the original learning. Uh… and tapping protocols simply, taking the SUD rating is the way it's done. You're familiar with the subjective units of distress rating, usually 0-10. And that activates the old learning. The contradictory, emotionally corrective experience is introduced. This is the most challenging part for any therapy. I will talk about that in a little while, but it's an inherit and strength of tapping protocols. And three that can, contradictory experiences repeated and umm… with acupoint tapping, you repeat the protocol focusing on various targeted aspects of the problem. These are called the rounds. Now focusing again on that second step, you're familiar with the term emotionally corrective experience. Acupoint tapping protocols almost inadvertently create contradicting or emotionally corrective experiences. Here's how this looks in a treatment context. You have the presenting problem, we start with a peaceful resting state. A triggering cue is introduced. A memory fragment of a difficult experience during kitten-hood is activated. An unwanted set of physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses is evoked. Here is a tapping protocol in a nutshell. The, the trigger or memory is brought to mind, evoking or predictable response in the amygdale. The distress is tap down to zero. Very quickly you get it down to zero. And you repeat that uh… process by or re-introduce new triggers. Tap it down, it goes down very quickly. Now the response has been modified. This is a different from what the brain expects or predicts. So this is what's predicted and this is what's experienced. So you have the contradicting experience, the essential ingredient for memory reconsolidation. They are happening very quickly with very little creativity on the therapist part. And in other therapies it, it's really takes a great deal of umm…. insight and effort to create just the right emotionally corrective experience and skill. This happens kind of automatically with the tapping, uh… protocols. So the mismatch, umm… happens during that little reconsolidation window and with the few repetition that causes new pathways to replace the old, so the old is depotentiated, it no longer exist and the new, that is experiences becomes the new association and we have a successful clinical outcome. Now umm…. we're gonna move to the videos and you can see how this happens. And I have gone a little bit over my time so we probably won't get to all the videos. Let me just, umm… switch over to the… 

00:40:20
[sil.] 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN I've always had a general fear. 

00:40:30
DAVID FEINSTEIN So this is a, umm… this was in 2000. I had just gotten certified the Energy Psychology and I like to show this first of all because I have very few videos of me working but also because, umm… it, it was, I was very new to it. And I just want to show that if you're already a skilled clinician, you can learn this very, very quickly. And umm… this was a… this is actually the first time I ever did it in front of other people. I was at a different conference and I just, umm… invited anybody who wanted to come and see, umm… a new approach I was experimenting with. And so I got this person to volunteer and about dozen people who were watching and she had a long standing, uh… fear of heights. So we'll see, uh… how this happens. Then we'll stop at various places for commentary. 

00:41:20
NANCY REEDER I've always had a general fear of heights. Umm… but I spent one summer in Europe umm… traveled all over and, and with a T-shirt from high school and we went to the (inaudible ), and we never been there. There's really no fence or, or any barricade or anything, at the edge there and you can walk literally right up to points. And he thought it would be very amusing to come up behind me and push me. And I just (inaudible ) got to my skin. I mean, he grabbed to hold of me before obviously I fell, but ever since then, I mean, I was just, just forget it. I, I don't want anywhere near the edge of anything. When I come close to the edge of something, I can stand back here or at the back edge of balcony here and, and be fine but if I come close I literally feel like I'm going to fall off and I almost throw myself off. It's like I, I can't stop that feeling. It's, it's awful. So that's kind of where I came from. I really got cemented there. 

00:42:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN Yeah. Yeah. So what we're gonna do first is that we're just going to with the camera, step outside to the balcony and you just gonna describe to us what you feel as you get closer to the edge without pushing yourself beyond a level of more discomfort thing you want to tolerate right now. 

00:42:45
NANCY REEDER Okay. 

00:42:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN Okay. So we're gonna step out. 

00:42:50
[sil.] 

00:43:20
NANCY REEDER I can't go… 

00:43:20
DAVID FEINSTEIN I'll just count to 15. 

00:43:25
NANCY REEDER I feel like I literally got to step forward. 

00:43:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN Great. 

00:43:25
NANCY REEDER Just, just fall over. 

00:43:30
DAVID FEINSTEIN Okay. So… 

00:43:30
NANCY REEDER I'm shaking. I just… It's uh… I don't want to look close to my eye. 

00:43:35
DAVID FEINSTEIN Just back off now to a comfortable way. 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:45
STEPHEN PORGES Okay. I, I'm going to interrupt, then make a couple of quick comments. Uh… the first comment really I have to do with it, introductory statement of tapping and humming. Uh… tapping and humming, if you're tapping the face, you're tapping the appearance of the facial nerve and if you're humming you're stimulating the appearance of the trigeminal nerve and those are major inputs to the nucleus ambiguus which you don't really care about. But the nucleus ambiguus what regulates the vagus. So if you're students of the pranayama yoga and people do these types of pressure points, they, they actually have direct neural influences on the area of the brain stem that regulates calming. So we can come up with, that's complementary uh… models of what's being done. And there're just differing metaphors in pranayama yoga uh… neuroanatomy and, and, and in a sense acupuncture. But the reason I interrupted at this point, I want you to see her face as she walked out and you saw the loss of neural tone to the upper part of the face. And you saw her started to shrink, trying to disappear. Starting to get into state of becoming in adamant. And that is the, that, that is really one of the major components of a trauma response, which is the attempt to disappear. And I'm gonna give it back to David and I apologize for interrupting. But what we want to look at is, what the treatment does to her face and her posture and her movements. Okay. 

00:45:15
DAVID FEINSTEIN Thank you. 

00:45:20
DAVID FEINSTEIN Nancy Reeder should distress when she would think of facing a height on a scale of 0 to 10. 

00:45:30
NANCY REEDER It's a 10. 

00:45:30
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's a 10. Yeah, it looks like a 10. 

00:45:35
NANCY REEDER It's a 10. 

00:45:35
DAVID FEINSTEIN Her remainder face was established to keep the phobia psychologically and the energetically active during the tapping treatment. The treatment consisted of tapping a series of acupuncture points about seven times each. This was followed by a procedure designed to synchronize right and left brain functioning and then another round of tapping. At this point, Nancy again needed to distress and thinking of facing a height. 

00:46:05
NANCY REEDER Let's do some more around six. 

00:46:05
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's down to a six from a 10. Okay. 

00:46:10
NANCY REEDER I don't feel that going forward. 

00:46:15
DAVID FEINSTEIN Okay, so there you saw very rapid that, that was less than two minutes of treatment. And she was from that high 10 to a six. That's the limbic system deactivation that umm… you, you don't see that kind of speed in exposure therapy, do you? It's very fast. You don't feel that… that's a real… The entire sequence was repeated. A third reading was given. Try to figure right now… 

00:46:40
NANCY REEDER Two. 

00:46:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's down to a two. So again the limbic system is deactivating very quickly, where, may be three or four minutes into the session. All right. We're going to take one more round and see what happens. It might bring it down a little, it might stay at two. Two is not a bad place for it to be. Go, we'll see what happens. We can go inside and, I actually like you, going up to the edge there. And… 

00:47:10
NANCY REEDER It's gone. 

00:47:10
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's gone. Okay. 

00:47:10
NANCY REEDER It's gone. 

00:47:15
DAVID FEINSTEIN Okay. Good. No, we're not done yet. Good. It's great that it's gone. Okay. One of the things that… Yeah, yeah, it's been (inaudible ) absorbed. 

00:47:23
NANCY REEDER Yeah. 

00:47:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN Yeah, yeah. So this is a great example of the mismatch experience of the experience that she's expecting when she brings out to her mind that she's going to feel the physiological and emotional responses to a height, she doesn't. So you have the expected and the experienced and very quickly the expected loses it's the power and the experience becomes dominant. And you don't know if it's gonna translate it on. 

00:47:55
NANCY REEDER I know, that's why I'm afraid of. 

00:47:55
DAVID FEINSTEIN Yeah. At this point one of the aspects of the problem was addressed, which was the memory of being pushed by her high school teacher while overlooking the cliff. One of the aspects to this problem is the memory she described of the high school teacher pushing you. Okay, because that, let's tie in with this. And so we didn't start there, we started with what the experience was, but now we're gonna, we want to neutralize that. 

00:48:25
NANCY REEDER Okay. 

00:48:30
DAVID FEINSTEIN Okay. And so, go into that memory right now and give it a rating from 0 to 10 of the amount of distress, it causing you right now. 

00:48:35
NANCY REEDER 11. 

00:48:35
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's right up there. It's really a tough one. 

00:48:35
NANCY REEDER It was bad. 

00:48:40
DAVID FEINSTEIN Yeah, okay. Another tapping sequence followed. The distress brought on by the memory was again rate it. Give it a rating to the amount of stress it causes you in a long run now? 

00:48:55
NANCY REEDER Umm… It feels like it's a long time ago. 

00:49:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN It feels like it's a long time ago. Yes. 

00:49:05
NANCY REEDER Yeah, umm… Maybe, maybe a two. 

00:49:05
DAVID FEINSTEIN Maybe a two. Okay. 

00:49:05
NANCY REEDER I think it feels like a long time ago. 

00:49:10
DAVID FEINSTEIN So that was just one round, may be two minute that the most and it's gone from really a 11 she said, down to, I can hear you read it. And what we're getting at there, is the different aspects. So her problem was her fear of heights. But that fear of heights, remember that constellation, it has a lot of aspects and part of which you're doing is uh… tapping therapists is there really tracking was going on with the client to find each of the aspects. And the aspects can be psychological, they can be physical and you just are tracking them so that you want to tap each of them down. And this part of what I like as the clinician umm… as oppose to before I had tapping is that, I can identify something, and so quickly resolve it. So you, you really able to work very quickly on these different… Even, even if you might have 10 different aspects that you work with, you might be able to do that in 15 minutes. Next was the positive outcome procedure. Once the distress has been reduced to two or less, the client can be instructed to envision being in the situation that had evoked the problematic emotional response. But this time, to imagine having an ideal response. A similar tapping series is used along with the visualization and an affirmation. After the sequence, Nancy read it how believable it was to her that she could face a height and have the desired response. Okay, now imagine that situation again. 

00:50:50
NANCY REEDER Uh-mmm… 

00:50:50
DAVID FEINSTEIN And read it in terms how (inaudible) do. 

00:50:55
[sil.] 

00:51:00
NANCY REEDER I'm, 10 being… 

00:51:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN 10 being… 

00:51:00
NANCY REEDER Very believable. 

00:51:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN Very believable. 

00:51:05
NANCY REEDER I'm 10, 8. 

00:51:05
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's an eight.. 

00:51:05
NANCY REEDER I'm 10, 8. Eight to nine. 

00:51:10
DAVID FEINSTEIN And so what we're doing there is, remember I said that tapping focuses on any of three things. It can focus on a memory, it can focus on a, a trigger that creates an unwanted response but it can also focus on a desired goal. And often when he get the reactivity way down, you then can shift your focus to the desired goal, it's not always necessary this, but it, umm… I think it really locks in the learning a lot better. I don't know umm… I don't have as good a theory about the neurology of the positive umm… implant as I have a sense of how the threat responses change, but I uh… a lot of clinical experience shows that like, like with sports umm… performance that there is a way to envision the goal just like you would with umm… positive imagery and tapping on that seems to give more power to the vision. So would you like to step out onto the balcony? 

00:52:15
NANCY REEDER Yeah. I'm ready. 

00:52:15
DAVID FEINSTEIN Just, just stay within your comfort zone again. We're not going to prove anything to anyone. 

00:52:15
NANCY REEDER Okay. 

00:52:20
DAVID FEINSTEIN Just within your comfort zone. 

00:52:20
NANCY REEDER Okay. 

00:52:25
[sil.] 

00:52:40
NANCY REEDER It's fine. 

00:52:45
[sil.] 

00:52:50
DAVID FEINSTEIN Just really feel as you look over. 

00:52:50
NANCY REEDER It feels fabulous. And it feels absolutely fabulous. It's gone. 

00:52:55
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's gone. 

00:52:55
NANCY REEDER It's gone. 

00:52:55
DAVID FEINSTEIN Yeah. Great. 

00:53:00
NANCY REEDER It's gone. That was, that was unbelievable. Unbelievable. 

00:53:10
There has been wide agreement within the clinical community on this point. 

00:53:10
DAVID FEINSTEIN Three days later, the last full day of the workshop, a follow-up interview is arranged. The balcony shown earlier was on the fourth floor of the hotel. Arrangements were made for the follow-up interview to be in a penthouse suite on the 17th, the top floor. 

00:53:30
NANCY REEDER It's beautiful up here and I'm falling… I can see almost all of my… It is absolutely wonderful. No fear. 

00:53:50
2-1/2 Years Later 

00:53:50
November 16, 2004 

00:53:50
Miami, Florida 

00:53:50
DAVID FEINSTEIN So Nancy, here we are. Well, just keep going on then. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN All right. And another energy healing or trauma in Miama, it's 2-1/2 years since your phobia treatment. Today is November 16th, 2004. 

00:54:10
NANCY REEDER Huh-Hmm. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN Then tell us what's happened in the last 2-1/2 years around your relationship to heights? 

00:54:20
NANCY REEDER It has been an amazing experience. It has absolutely helped. What I started to realize in my life though was that the fear, it tapped into a generalized fear in me. Umm… it's hard to describe except that, the things that I might not otherwise tackle, I did because I had, I realized I could, I could tackle that height phobia, a final thing which has been so cool. I, just this past year of 2004, my husband and I went to uh… Cork in Ireland and we went to Blonay Castle and we went over to The Dingle Peninsula umm… which is on the Western half and it has cliffs very similar to the White Cliffs, which is where, of course, all of this started. And I, no fencing, no nothing and I stood there and enjoyed the scenery and enjoyed the, the water and, and it was no problem whatsoever. And so then I went to Blonay Castle and decided I'm going to do this and I climbed all the way to the top and I bend over and I kissed that stone. And it was fantastic. So here's absolutely healed. I recommend it highly, I just, I appreciate it and thank you. 

00:55:40
STEPHEN PORGES Like a couple of comments… So you could see major changes in the upper part of her face and major changes in basic state. I want to bring you back again to you first semester course in psychology. You might have learned something about single trial learning, uh… case diversion, uh… Garcia's work, UCLA decades ago. Uh… if you think of trauma as case diversion and it's subdiaphragmatic, dorsal vagal shutting down, immobilization response. And that movement is incompatible, voluntary movement is incompatible with that neural structure of mobilization. And what is tapping doing? Tapping is not only touching the certain areas, it's also a voluntary movement which makes it incompatible with shutting down. So again with you trauma clients, we often see in uh… their fear, the greatest fear is immobilization. So they often do high risk behaviors and mobilize, but within a structured clinical setting the tapping is recruiting this voluntary behavior, which creates that physiological state that is incompatible with shutting down and helps build on that memory reconsolidation. 

00:56:50
DAVID FEINSTEIN Thank you. So the next video, I'm not the therapist, it was umm… done with the, a group of uh, 11 people with PTSD. Nine of them veterans were brought to a hotel for five days and worked with a series of EFT tapping therapists. And umm… and they, they video taped it, they did a lot of research on a lot of peoples testing and which you will see are… little snippets of the person before any treatment, you'll see on the screen, the text will be, what showed up on the tests in terms of their symptoms and then you'll see a brief snippet of the actual tapping session. And then you'll see them after five days, at the end of the session and, and you'll umm… also see texts on three month follow-up. They actually get follow-up more than three months which held stable, but three months was when the video was made. So umm… so we'll show this first person and uh… you kind of need put on, put on your clinical cap in a sense because you see a lot of pain in this. So, you know, empathize and let it move through you.

ANDY HODNIK It could be just the medic that, that carried work on King.

00:59:30
CAROL LOOK Okay. 

00:59:35
STEPHEN PORGES So in addition to focusing on symptoms, another aspect of a symptom or the core beliefs that are driving that symptoms. So he, so what happens next is he begins to tap on those core beliefs. Just see how the therapist does that. 

00:59:50
CAROL LOOK Can I do little bit on that, even though I have to be perfect? 

00:59:55
ANDY HODNIK Even though I have to be perfect…

BOB CULVER And I know that I got to talk about it. I know I got to get to through it, and I know what's, you know, there's the after effect and then, and then the fucking nightmares are gonna start again, the intrusive thoughts are gonna start again and I'm gonna replay this whole thing all over again. But I know eventually I have to because I'm going to destroy it, or it's gonna destroy me. 

01:01:00
GARY CRAIG You what? 

01:01:05
BOB CULVER I throw up. 

01:01:10
GARY CRAIG He came back, his face was ash and everything and we just kept tapping on it. What other pieces of this memory are showing up? It's like sound or what? 

01:01:15
BOB CULVER Mostly the body parts and the blood and the smell, I could feel it. You can see it. 

01:01:20
GARY CRAIG Okay. All right, here. Even though I have this, this blood in his body parts. 

01:01:25

01:01:40
GARY CRAIG The next day we collapsed, it still further and further and further till he would just talk about it like it was nothing. 

01:01:45
BOB CULVER We just started pulling bodies out. 

01:01:50
GARY CRAIG And how many bodies were there? 

01:01:50
BOB CULVER I think all total that we saw 15 killed. Hey, you know, it's amazing how I feel right now. I can actually, I can actually talk about a combat.

BOB CULVER And I mean this sincerely. Especially, you know, talking about, you know, probably (inaudible )and veterans. If you want to try EFT, I'm sure there's a way that they will know about it and give it a shot because I'm living proof of this, you know, so hang in there. 

01:02:40
DAVID FEINSTEIN So there you, you saw again that jerks the position experience, where he's talking about things that just an hour ago where causing him to vomit and he's talking about them calmly. So again that becomes the new learning that you don't have that kind of reaction. He doesn't go into that fear part of the constellation. Umm… the last one is two minutes. Do we have time for a one more? Okay. 

01:03:10
[sil.] 

01:03:15
STEPHEN PORGES Let me just kind of summarize, a lot of the points that David has made is really about memory reconsolidation. I want you to think that there's a major influence of state. So we learn differently, we met, we, become associate differently based upon physiological state. Also the incompatibility of movement with uh… immobilization. And one in his last videos where the gentlemen have to get up and say "I have to vomit right now, I have to regurgitate." This is that immobilization Subdiaphragmatic, dorsal vagus uh… becoming part of this uh… conservation response, because when reptiles go defensive, it have to inhibit breathing and so is the heartrate or go under water for a few hours, they will defecate to reduce the metabolic demands. And you start seeing this played out in remnants of our own (inaudible ). So the first take home, I want you to, I want to emphasize is that you can see major changes, and you can see the major changes are associate with the biobehavioral state changes. You can see them in the face, you can see them in the posture and you can hear it in the intonation of the voice. These are quantifiable variables that suggest that there is an engagement now of what in Polyvagal words, we say is the Social Engagement Systems now back on board. When that's back on board, the rest of the autonomic nervous system supports, only static function is no longer recruited in defense. And so you don't have this threshold to go back and forth between aggressive and aggressor and victim from shutting down to becoming highly mobilized. So you can start seeing that there is a strong phenomenon that shifts in physiological states and there's a different development of the association of the event with the visceral feeling. Uh… the issue of what one calls controversy would be the identification of the true underlying neural mechanisms, but as uh… in a sense compassion human beings, if we have methodologies and technologies, they are helpful. We want to use them before we dispel their use because we don't understand how they're used. And so we are learning and I think David's presentation highlighted a whole set of future questions. And one question I will ask him now before the end because I probably forget is, whether or not tapping can be used for case diversion? It would be a wonderful experiment, that basically would, in a sense be a model for what's going on. David, you're on. 

01:06:00
DAVID GRAND Okay. Umm… sound, sound is good enough. You can hear me out there? Okay, umm… first of all I want to thank, thank David for his presentation. Umm… and I want you to watch for the commonalities between brainspotting and energy psychology and watch for the differences. Umm… again this is how we are finding our way into the future of psychotherapy and brain body based, based therapies. Umm… uh… I'm here to talk about brainspotting and also to talk about some of the neurobiological hypothesis about brainspotting. Umm… so having Dr. Porges here to observe and comment is uh… is a great opportunity for me, it's a treat in fact because uh… we're always looking to understand how, what we're doing is getting the effects uh… that it is. Uh… for me it's very special being here. I presented at Networker before but never in this size room with this size of crowd. So I want to remember all of you. So I'm going to take a picture. And just make sure that people know that I was really here, I'm gonna make it a selfie. Here we go. Okay. Umm… How many of you have heard of brainspotting before, just raise your hands? Okay. How many of you have not heard of brainspotting before? Okay, it's about 60 have heard, 40% have not. How many of you are actually trained in brainspotting? No? Somehow it's more on this side of the room than the other for whatever reason. Umm… uh… brainspotting has been in, in existence for 13 years. So we are very new and actually we have one of our trainers here, Steve Sawyer, you can just stand up. And uh… uh… brain, the brainspotting attempts to a line, the clinical processes with the neurobiological processes. This is really a very, very umm… it goes along with (inaudible ) goes interpersonal neurobiology, but what we look for is the idea of uh… of really seeing what gets the effect from what we are doing as opposed to what we believe gets the effect or what we have been told gets the effect. So, so in this we do a great deal of experimentation between what we are trying out and, and what happens and try to understand it in, in neurological terms to really see if we have back up that what is happening goes along with how the brain works. And of course, we know more and more about the brain, so, so we have a chance to know more and more about the clinical processes. I'm going to quickly run through a brainspotting. Uh… by the way both David and I uh… are doing separately, all day presentations tomorrow. So if you want to see more of David, you know, uh… and hopefully you're signed up uh… or from myself. So uh… David just gave a brief review. He could have talk on. I could see he was just holding himself back. Umm… and, but, but here this is just a brief introduction to brainspotting uh… but tomorrow I will have a chance to, both in the morning, the afternoon, do a full day on it. Umm… in brainspotting we use the Dual Attunement Frame, and the Dual Attunement Frame is the relational attunement uh… focused and framed by the neurobiological attunement. In regard to relational attunement umm… the medic studies have shown that the one factor that, that gets the clinical result in every psychotherapy is the relationship. So we know that this is the most powerful thing. And although brainspotting is a brain-body relational therapy, the relationship comes, comes first, which is unusual for most, most technical psychotherapies, or most brain based or body based psychotherapies. It's not the only one but, but for us, in looking at, at our interaction with the client and looking for us being able to help them with what they bring. Uh… the idea is that we are focused not on the technique, we are not focused on, on what we are going to, to see what we are going to do, we're focused on being present with the client. And we have found that the most powerful healing aspect in brainspotting and every psychotherapy is, is attuned, empathic witnessing presence of the therapist. And for all of you here, everybody in this room, okay. You already know this, but you don't know what is well as you should and I'm saying that because I don't know what is well I should, even though I, I've been studying this so closely. We, we get distracted in terms of, of really what we're there for and what we're supposed to do and what's the diagnosis and what's the history and where is it going and we get distracted away, away from the fact that just by sitting in front of the client and really being present with them and really listening to them openly and following them wherever they go is the most powerful aspect of what we do and is what brings about the greatest results. So just coming away from this presentation uh… I want to encourage you to be extra mindful of that when you go back to your practices. Umm… but in brainspotting, uh… we, we use visual orienting. The watchword in brainspotting is where you look effects how you feel. And what we have observed is that visual, visually orienting, especially for a person in a state of activation around an issue, around what brings them umm… is really uh… a cue to where the client is holding the experience in the brain that is being reflected in, in the symmetric processes. So, so in brainspotting uh… at the same time is, we're relationally present, we have three different ways of finding what we call brain spots or relevant eye positions. Relevant eye position in contrast to a random eye position, because if you just hold up your finger and, or have a client look at any spot in the room and focus on it, if they will get a clinical effect because they, they are then orienting towards it and organizing around it. But, what we have found in brainspotting is, is that there are certain eye positions that for, for each client and it's different from client to client and it's different at uh… just for one client from session to session. Certain eye positions that are, are revealing of where experience is held neural physiologically. The uh… uh… So what we do is, we, we, we harness the relational attunement with the neuron biological attunement. We call that the dual attunement frame. Uh… in that frame, that's, that's where the, the response happens. So I'm gonna talk a little bit about, about the eye positions. But I want to talk first about the uncertainty principle. Umm… many or most of you heard about the uncertainty principle from quantum physics and Heisenberg. But in brainspotting, we have, we take, take a bit of the concept but we, we take the name to reflect on, on the fact that neurobiologically there are at least one quadrillion synoptic connections in, in the human nervous system. One quadrillion and it is estimated, there may be as many as five quadrillion neurological synoptic connections. Now at one quadrillion is a million multiplied by a billion or a billion multiplied by a million. That's a number that, that if I put it up here, you couldn't even look at the number and take it in, just even visually that number is, is that vast in that complex. So based on the fact that a person has one quadrillion connections may be more, our clients when they are sitting in front of us, how do we have a chance to really understand and really know what's going on inside of them? I mean, essentially we don't really know where they have been, we only know what they tell us. We don't really know where they are. We sort of see from the outside but we don't, we can't really look inside all those connections, those that the infinite connections and we don't really know where they are going. Even as we observe the process, they are moving so rapidly and, and so deeply and with such complexity that we can't really follow them where, wherever they go. And this is sort of a challenge to us as psychotherapists because we are supposed to know why they are the way they are. We are supposed to know what's happening, we're supposed to know how to intervene. Brainspotting sort of turns that on its head and with the uncertainty principle, we're guided to sit in front of the client knowing that we can't possibly know any of these things, which allows us to sort of clear out, this is a bit of more of an eastern approach. And really just sit with the client and just follow them wherever they go. We use the metaphor of the comet but the client is the head of the comet and that what we try to do is to get into the tale of the comet. Now and that's the metaphor, the brainspotting metaphor for attunement. However, what happens is, just because we get into the tale of the comet, it doesn't mean we stay in the tale of the comet. Because no matter how attune we get, no matter how much we follow the client, we're going to fall out of attunement, that's a natural sort of process. So when that happens, it's important for us to be aware that we are losing attunement and we've lost attunement that we fall and out of the tale of a comet, so that we can work away back into the tale of the comet and then continue the attunement with the client. Umm…. There are basically three ways of finding brain spots or relevant eye positions. The first one is the way that I discovered brainspotting and we call it outside window of brainspotting. Uh… when a client is activated, you go very slowly and I'm gonna take out my pointer because this is what we use. We go very slowly across the visual field looking for reflexive responses and the eyes and the face and, and also in the body, all though it's hard to see it all at the same time. And when you go across and, and all of a sudden the client's eyes start uh… blinking very quickly. That's, that's an outside window of brain spot. And if you just stop there or at any one, you actually get clinical effect, but then you keep on going across and all of a sudden a client squinch their eyes, that's another outside window spot. You go across and the client goes back like this. You're going to see in the video that when we get to the, we get the spot with, with our client, he actually goes like this. You see that full response to it. And what's interesting is that, is that I was using the second way of finding brain spots or relevant eye positions which is inside window. Inside window is, instead of way you're looking for the spots from the outside, you're, you're finding out from the client where they feel that activation the most or they have the greatest access to it. So as you're going across, you say, umm… you have already established with the client, how activated they are and where they feel it in their body and from there you say "Do you feel it more when you look to your right, more in the middle or more to a left? And you're gonna see this in the video. And then from there, let's say the client says it's, it's to the right and you say, "is it more above eye level, eye to eye level or below eye level?" The client says "It's below eye level" then you fine tune it, because these inside window spots can be very, very precise, very specific. Umm… and you're gonna see in the video, I'm actually looking for an inside window spot and the spot where he feels at the most is the spot where he has this reaction. So it's both in, an inside and an outside window brain spot. The third way and this is something I want you to be all mindful of it in your practices is what we call Gazespotting, where the client as they are talking about what's really activating them or what, what is most, emotionally loaded, you'll see often times, they look at a spot, sometimes they even talk to a spot. They just look at a spot on the floor and they talk as if they are having a soliloquy in relation to the spot. Umm… it's not random when this happens, and human being, beings do this overtime. We all do this. We do this one when we're thinking, when we're speaking and, and there is something about this that indicates that there's something there. It's, it's a visual orienting process and it's not just moving the eyes, often times it's moving the head, even the upper body towards that spot. Umm… what we do in brainspotting is with any of these spots, but with the gaze spot, we have the client just look at that spot continue to gaze at that spot and observe their internal process. Umm… So, there, again the three ways are outside window, inside window and Gazespotting. You're going to see manifestations of all three of this in, in the video. Now umm… we don't have protocols in brainspotting, because brainspotting is oriented towards attunement, not, not towards replication. And, and so in this sense, if you have a protocol that you have to do, that the therapist has to comply with and then the client has to comply with, that by nature is going to take you out of attunement. But we have guidelines and, and a set up process that's flexible and that you can drop things out or add things in. We start with the client bringing the issue and then from the issue we ask them, "are they activated around it?" Generally speaking, the client is activated, but if they are not, we guide them to go inside and to activate themselves. In other words, to just try to push up that level of activation and it's using not to hard to do. From there as, as with uh… with Energy Psychology, we then take SUDS to rate the level of activation. And we use the word activation because it is a brain, body, experiential term, it covers all three. So, so to stress sometimes for some people means one thing but it doesn't mean something else. So after we go from the issue to the activation to the SUDS, we ask them "where do you feel it in your body now?" Again this comes… Working with body awareness in terms of my own development is, as a therapist comes out of somatic experiencing, we give credit to Peter Levine for this. But we're then seeing where the client is holding the activation in their body. And then from there, at that point, we then either go for the outside window, the inside window or the client may already be orienting towards a, a gaze spot. We call this step by step process of the, of the setting of the frame. We call it a process by which we get increasingly focused activation. So that each step from being aware of the activation, taking the number, seeing where you feel in the body and then finding the spot where it resonates, it takes that activation and makes it very focused, which hypothetically is again aligning to the focused activation in the brain that's felt in the body. From there, the process and you're gonna see this again in the video. We go into what this called processing. In a brainspotting we call it focused mindfulness. Because it is a mindfulness process, but its mindfulness done in a state of focused activation. So that the mindfulness is very focused and, and has a different mode, a deeper more rapid quality than if you just do mindfulness without that level of, of focused activation. Now I want to move on just to the, to the two basic neurobiological umm… theories about how brainspotting works. Uh… the first one uh… comes from Scotland, from Dr Frank Corrigan, who is a neuron-psychiatrist and a brain genius. He observed me doing the first day of the phase I brainspotting training in Edinburgh and he said to me "Oh! I, I think I know how brainspotting works." And I guarantee you, I jumped in that. And he sat down with me and he started talking about the superior colliculus and the periaqueductal gray and, and well these sort of things, which at the time I didn't even know what they were, I have to admit. Umm… but he said umm… I believe that brainspotting is the most subcortical of all the techniques out there, which of course is very powerful for me to hear. But what he, his explanation which we then wrote a paper on. He wrote 95% of the paper, I wrote five percent of the paper and I had to read his part of the paper five times before I began to understand it. Umm…. what he said is that his, his theory was that brainspotting gets access to the mid-brain. The mid-brain is at the top and the back of the brain stem, to the superior colliculus, which has five layers and they are the top layer, is the visual layer. So he, he said that brainspotting gets to the visual layer and a superior colliculus, finds the right file and then holds it open. Holds it open meaning that, ones the client is, is on that spot, they keeps staring at that spot. Again, this, this was umm… this was, this is the first neurobiological theory about brainspotting. And umm… uh… we've done a second paper together looking at the uh… older somatic processes, the spinothalamic tract and its role in, in brainspotting. Umm… now I'm gonna go into this a lot more tomorrow. The second hypothesis comes out from a German Croatian brain scientist, who also is the psychotherapist and he studied psychotherapy and he has been trained by… They have brain experts there that we have never heard off, by Günther Scheppach. I know, is there anybody in the room ever heard of Günther Scheppach? Well, in Germany all hands would go up. Okay, he's a big short there. Anyhow, uh… the Damir Del Monte has uh… has been studying this and he has studied brainspotting. He looks at the brain in terms of regulation and what parts of the brain are involved in regulation and what parts of uh… particularly the cortex, what parts of the cortex are involving regulation and what parts of the cortex are actually not involved in regulation. And, and this leads to some of the theories that, that we have, he has, for how brainspotting works. Basically, our clients come to us in a state of dysregulation. It's a very simplified way of looking at it. In other words, they can't feel the way they want to feel, they can't think the way they want to, they want to act and they, the way they want to think and they can't act the way that they want to act, whether it's just internally or whether it's uh… interpersonally. And the process of psychotherapy for all of us here and for every psychotherapist is to help bring client out of dysregulation into regulation. Now according to, to Damir's concepts, there are parts of the, of the cortex that are very involved in regulation and there are parts that are not very involved in regulation. And when you understand that, it helps you to target what you are trying to do psychotherapeutically. If you go to the neocortex and to the high processing areas in terms of language and conceptualization, those areas are not actually involved in ongoing regulation of the limbic system in the brain stem and the midbrain. But if you go to the areas that are lower down in the cortex, more towards the middle, the ventral medial, the uh… umm… orbital frontal and the anterior cingulate cortex. Those areas are directly involved in regulation. And if you go even deeper into, into the, what's called the allocortex, which is also the limbic cortex. And many of you don't even know that the limbic system has a cortex, which includes the cingulate gyrus and the hippocampus. That, that area is very directly involved in regulation. So psychotherapy, whether it's brainspotting or whether it's symmetrical based therapies or anything else, this is where we aligned a clinical process and neurobiological process need to be able to access and work with the areas of the brain that are involved regulation. And when you do that, the clients may have, have a good session and they leave and they come back the following week and they actually process through further, as opposed to, if you enter into the system through the neocortex, where they have a good session and they come back the next week and it's like they never had that first session. So anyhow, from this I want to go right into, into the video uh… and I'll see very quickly. Uh… this was a demonstration that I did at a, at a training a year and half ago. It was a man who had been gaze bashed uh, over 30 years before and had uh… a severe insomnia. Umm… so you're going to see uh… It's about 18 minutes. You're gonna see the process. Uh… Dr. Porges, please at any time you want me to stop, just say stop and uh… I won't have a startle response. Umm… 

01:27:35
[sil.] 

01:27:40
It had been edited here for presentation purposes 

01:27:45
DAVID GRAND: Up the line. The volume is not coming through. It was coming through before umm…. we're gonna need a sound person in here like, very quickly. 

01:28:00
[sil.] 

01:28:05
DAVID GRAND Uh… we can try it but… 

01:28:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's, that's what he said was… 

01:28:15
DAVID GRAND What's that? 

01:28:20
[sil.] 

01:28:30
UNKNOWN Gay bashed. I've been on pretty duty sleep medicine for a long time. And uh… I'd like to cut it down. 

01:28:40
[sil.] 

01:28:45
UNKNOWN Umm… I was uh… It was 1980 and I was in a place that's kind of dangerous umm… but I was… I sense danger and I was like on my way to car and seven guys jumped me from behind and umm… they… they just kept kicking me and beating me and umm… I think they would have killed me if a car hadn't driven by and honked. And umm… and I was in such (inaudible ) in state that I actually got up and drove myself to the hospital. Umm… they followed me to make sure I got there. I had a broken collar bone and umm… a, uh… my face was unrecognizable. It was umm… probably eight, nine years later I started having tear attacks in the middle of the night. And they would umm… they would start like it may be. I'd wake up at like one in the morning and they would not stop until the sun came up. 

01:30:10
DAVID GRAND Umm…as horrific as that event was, generally speaking uh… single event trauma uh… will not result in, in that kind of sleep disruption and you mentioned earlier, you know, a very early abuse. Uh… but I'm still in a start on the premise of working with this as a single event trauma. If other things come up then, then we'll see where it goes. If it doesn't move as much as we might expected to in this trauma then we'll go into the uh… the hypothesis that they are underlying, you know, uh… traumatic memories there. Just even sitting here and talking with me about it, how is it feeling to? 

01:30:55
Assessing the SUDS Level 

01:30:55
UNKNOWN It's coming up. Right now, it's about a seven, it's going up. 

01:30:55
DAVID GRAND With that seventh, are you getting any part of the experience? 

01:31:00
UNKNOWN I'm just feeling like being hit. 

01:31:00
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:31:00
UNKNOWN In this area. 

01:31:05
DAVID GRAND Umm… I probably going to bring you back at some point to the first moment that you knew something was happening, but you already there, you're already processing. Let's find the spot, not just where you feel the most but we feel the most direct access to the, to the experience and to what you're feeling in your body. Is it more to your right? 

01:31:25
[sil.] 

01:31:30
DAVID GRAND More in the middle? 

01:31:35
DAVID GRAND Or more to… Yeah. 

01:31:35
UNKNOWN To the left. 

01:31:40
DAVID GRAND A little further out. 

01:31:45
UNKNOWN And I think it's more… come closer in. 

01:31:45
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:31:50
UNKNOWN May be just a little one. No, up there. 

01:31:55
DAVID GRAND Right there? Okay. I'm gonna go check the Y-axis, so you will have to readjust me. Umm… and more above eye level? At eye level or below? 

01:32:10
UNKNOWN Eye level. 

01:32:10
DAVID GRAND Okay, if I'm not on it really just readjust me again. Let's just see where it goes. And you can stay in touch with me as, as much as you want to as, as least as you want to, either way I'll be checking in. 

01:32:35
UNKNOWN Is umm… much as I'm capable of this last minute, which I can kind of, I'm seeing my car. 

01:32:40
DAVID GRAND Huh-Hmm. 

01:32:45
UNKNOWN And that I was headed towards it. And I was like going about 50 feet away from it. And it looked like safety, and then they hit me from behind. 

01:33:00
DAVID GRAND Did you have any idea that, that they were behind you? 

01:33:00
UNKNOWN No. 

01:33:00
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:33:05
UNKNOWN No. I knew something was wrong. But it was only one person at that time. 

01:33:10
DAVID GRAND And where was that person in relation to where you are? 

01:33:15
UNKNOWN He's about sitting, standing about here. 

01:33:15
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:33:20
UNKNOWN And then I left. And I didn't even feel him following me. 

01:33:25
The client continues processing for a few minutes 

01:33:30
UNKNOWN Well, I'm going is a… how frightening, it's the sleep, go to bed. I'm kind of amazed how easy it is for me to fall asleep during the day. I'm real, actually get very tired during the day and I wake up when the sun sets. 

01:33:55
DAVID GRAND Just being mindful of that in particular, let's see if anything comes up and out of that. 

01:34:05
[sil.] 

01:34:10
DAVID GRAND I want you to be aware of just the physicality of that jump that you had, like what you felt, like you know, and even more so where it fell like it emanated from in your body, the emanation point? 

01:34:20
UNKNOWN Here comes… It feels like it comes from here but it connects right in here. 

01:34:25
DAVID GRAND Okay, just for the moment be aware of where it starts from. Good, good. Good. That's it. That's it. Good. 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN I feel like I'm being punched. 

01:34:50
[sil.] 

01:34:55
DAVID GRAND Okay. Can you still see me and feel my presence? 

01:34:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:35:00
DAVID GRAND Okay. Anything you need from me, just let me know. Good. Good. 

01:35:10
UNKNOWN I couldn't tell anyone that this has happened. I have one friend I could tell. I couldn't tell my family, I couldn't tell and this is really ashamed of… 

01:35:25
DAVID GRAND Even though you're looking at the point there, you can so see me. And umm… this is not just a matter of, to keep you grounded. This is a matter, a matter of helping to feel uh… like you're less alone, that somebody is with you who cares. 

01:35:45
[sil.] 

01:35:50
DAVID GRAND That's it. Just let yourself go into it. That's it. That's it, Randy. 

01:36:05
[sil.] 

01:36:10
The client continues processing this way for a few minutes 

01:36:15
DAVID GRAND That's it. It's likely that, that those are deep freeze releases. Okay, a freeze that you have been, and since then. I actually be releasing now. So it's, very much can celebrate those jobs. 

01:36:40
The client and Dr. Grand continue processing for several more minutes 

01:36:40
DAVID GRAND Let's go back to the incident now and let see how it comes up for you. 

01:36:50
UNKNOWN Little kind of comes along with when I close my eyes, I see like black, grey and black and… That's what it comes up, is how dark it was. 

01:37:05
DAVID GRAND Okay. If it is better for you to keep your eyes closed with that for now, than just process from there? 

01:37:10
UNKNOWN I think so. 

01:37:10
DAVID GRAND Yeah. 

01:37:15
UNKNOWN So I'm, I'm processing something that I don't want to say anything about. 

01:37:20
DAVID GRAND Not necessary to speak about it. But it is valuable to process it. 

01:37:25
UNKNOWN It's bringing reminder. 

01:37:30
[sil.] 

01:37:35
UNKNOWN Need to come out of spot up there for a little bit. 

01:37:35
DAVID GRAND Okay, do you know where that spot is? 

01:37:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:37:40
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:37:45
Approximately 1 minute elapses 

01:37:50
[sil.] 

01:37:55
Approximately 2 minutes elapses 

01:37:55
UNKNOWN No, you know, I became very aware of the goal being here. 

01:38:00
DAVID GRAND You're motioning to your left. Uh… of course that's where the larger group is but people are all around you and you know, to your right as well. I'm just wondering if there's any meaning to that. 

01:38:15
UNKNOWN I couldn't see them until you brought it up. 

01:38:20
Approximately 30 seconds elapses 

01:38:25
UNKNOWN It makes me wonder what will happen if the point was over there. 

01:38:30
[sil.] 

01:38:35
DAVID GRAND All right. Do you want me to try? 

01:38:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, try right over here. 

01:38:40
[sil.] 

01:38:45
UNKNOWN Oh, they did hit me from back here. 

01:38:50
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:38:50
UNKNOWN That's where they came from. 

01:38:55
[sil.] 

01:39:00
UNKNOWN I didn't know that, till just now. 

01:39:05
[sil.] 

01:39:10
The client and Dr. Grand continue processing for several more minutes 

01:39:15
UNKNOWN It feels like if I let go… Right now… I die. 

01:39:30
DAVID GRAND Was this the survival stands to your end during the assault, during the bashing? 

01:39:35
UNKNOWN My guess is yes. 

01:39:40
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:39:40
UNKNOWN And it's kind of like a … I have two experiences going on at once, like I'm on the ground and then I'm kind of like 

01:39:50
[sil.] 

01:39:55
UNKNOWN Seeing myself walking towards the car after all it's happened. 

01:40:00
The client and Dr. Grand continue processing for several more minutes 

01:40:05
DAVID GRAND I have a question or two. Did you at any point lose consciousness during the bashing? 

01:40:10
UNKNOWN No. 

01:40:10
UNKNOWN Were you hit? You were hitting the face or obviously, you're hitting the head and neck. 

01:40:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:40:20
DAVID GRAND You could have lost consciousness, you know, gone into a coma or you could have been killed. 

01:40:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:40:30
DAVID GRAND And I'm wondering if that is part of the fear going to sleep also. 

01:40:40
UNKNOWN Listen, it certainly hasn't hit me until more recently that I could have been killed. That part kind of stayed in the background like, that didn't happen to me, it wouldn't happen to me but lately I've been saying "Oh! God, yes, it could have happened to me." 

01:41:00
DAVID GRAND I believe that during and throughout the assault, you know that your life was definitely in danger. 

01:41:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:41:10
DAVID GRAND So although it only hit you recently, you knew it all the way back from the incident itself. 

01:41:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:41:20
DAVID GRAND It could be that an addition to the, the fear of the uh… night terrors and flashbacks. You know, there's a fear of, of death from not just what everybody carries but uh… from being in a situation where you were, could have been killed. And as trauma goes, until it's over you don't know if you're gonna survive. Afterwards as, as horribly beaten as you were, you knew you had survived, but until the moment it was over, you are directly facing, you know, your death. What I'm thinking is that the insane thing about this, is that as, as exquisitely personalized it feels and truth it really is not personal. 

01:42:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:42:10
DAVID GRAND And even, even directing, you know, that kind of heinousness at a person because they're gay. It's all because of the poison inside of the person and in a group even more so. 

01:42:25
UNKNOWN But what's going in now is just the full extent of the hatred. 

01:42:30
DAVID GRAND Okay. Which spot is the spot for that, this or back to the other or this, one up there or another one? 

01:42:40
UNKNOWN This one, this direction. 

01:42:45
DAVID GRAND Okay. 

01:42:50
The client and Dr. Grand continue processing for several more minutes 

01:42:50
DAVID GRAND Are you ready to go there now? 

01:42:55
Approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds elapses 

01:42:55
UNKNOWN More ready. There is one coming. There wasn't even stopping and that car didn't come by. There was no stopping. 

01:43:10
DAVID GRAND So if that car didn't go by, then they likely would have killed you. 

01:43:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:43:20
DAVID GRAND I could check out this original spot? 

01:43:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:43:25
DAVID GRAND Okay. You're gonna have to, have to reestablish it. 

01:43:30
Reassessing the SUDS Level 

01:43:30
UNKNOWN I still feel something around three. 

01:43:30
DAVID GRAND Around a three? 

01:43:35
UNKNOWN Still scared. 

01:43:40
STEPHEN PORGES Let me make a quick comment. You start seeing things changing in the upper part, the upper part of his face, the orbicularis. Uh… and we also saw and basically he was shrunk during most of the whole segment. And now there, it's starting to become more episodes of the upper face starting to work. Umm… it's complicated case to look at. Uh… but you can see this state changes, the state elucidating(ph) and this whole notion of dying which is immobilizing, shutting down. And when you see… When he is conceptualizing at this stage of the… of your intervention, the upper part of the face is trying to work which makes it incompatible with totally shutting down. 

01:44:25
DAVID GRAND What did you, what did you make of the jumps? 

01:44:30
STEPHEN PORGES The jumps are, you know, this is, I mean, he's been hit. He's re-living the contractions of his body and he's also, that posture of protecting ventral side. so he was obviously leading forward and trying to protect him. And the jumps are, I mean, I've never seen that. Have you ever seen that before? 

01:44:50
DAVID GRAND Yes. 

01:44:55
STEPHEN PORGES Okay, under what conditions? 

01:44:55
DAVID GRAND Uh… really people coming out of a deep freeze. 

01:45:00
STEPHEN PORGES Okay, when they come out of deep freeze, that, that occurs because when they are in that muscle contracted mode uh… there's no blood, they'd lose blood in the area. When they relaxed, the blood starts coming back. So if you even think in terms of Tre, TRE, some people know that type of therapy uh… where you're doing isometric and so all to get a trauma. And it's very similar in terms of something. So it's, and in somatic experiencing, you know, they talk about the same thing the, the uh… movement. I see that as the blood coming back to the muscles and the muscles start working. But in this situation, the scenario may have been… He may have actually told to shutdown even though he's not totally re-living it. He just coming in and out of those states and you, you started probing him about those questions. Did you pass out, did you go into this states. He might have. He might have gone into multiple and that's what those jolts are really… You see, I interpret him as he was being kicked. And but it also could occur if he's coming in and out of, of a state of, of passing out, this awakening. So we'll finish this and then we'll have a little discussion among stress helps. 

01:46:15
DAVID GRAND Now I'll tell you a trick about sleep. It happens when we don't notice it. 

01:46:20
[sil.] 

01:46:25
DAVID GRAND So if you're watching yourself, try to fall asleep. It makes you kind of hard to do it. 

01:46:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, during the day I'm not thinking about it. 

01:46:35
DAVID GRAND Let's bring me back to the, to the spot. 

01:46:40
The client and Dr. Grand continue processing for several more minutes when the client comes to a realization… 

01:46:45
Approximately 2 minutes elapse 

01:46:45
UNKNOWN My ability to safe is not measurable what we've done today. 

01:46:55
DAVID GRAND That's really important. 

01:47:00
[sil.] 

01:47:05
Before wrapping up the session 

01:47:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:47:15
The client and Dr. Grand continue processing for several more minutes 

01:47:15
Approximately 30 seconds elapse 

01:47:15
DAVID GRAND I'm gonna take the pointer down now. This is what I want to say to you in finishing. Without me looking around in the room here, now, we're at any point of the process, I can say that he that provided everybody here with a deeply meaningful healing experience. 

01:47:40
UNKNOWN That's why I'm still here. 

01:47:40
DAVID GRAND And, and I think… 

01:47:40
UNKNOWN That's why I wasn't killed. 

01:47:45
DAVID GRAND That's… okay. 

01:47:50
[sil.] 

01:47:55
DAVID GRAND And you can carry that with you wherever you go, day or night, awake or asleep. And I, I hope that the healing that you provide and the deep learning you provided here, really flows right into your healing, since this was being about your healing needs. And maybe even a sense that a group of people surrounding you can be part of your healing and can be safe and loving. 

01:48:30
UNKNOWN So we started in there? 

01:48:30
DAVID GRAND Yeah. 

01:48:35
[sil.] 

01:48:45
DAVID GRAND And, and your opening part on Polyvagal uh… theory, you talked about that prosodic and the social engagement. 

01:48:55
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah. 

01:48:55
DAVID GRAND So I'm just curious what you saw with that. 

01:49:00
STEPHEN PORGES Okay. So let's go back to your beginning premise about brainspotting, your emphasis on, that's a relational therapy, which means it's always using the features of the social engagement system to kind of keep boundaries or containment of the other individual's, emotional or visceral reactivity or implicit feelings. So the use of voice, the use of facial, the, checking back in, the words you use are all about making sure the individual maintained an interaction. And when you maintain that interaction, you can't slip into these lower defensive states, releases much more difficult. So as long as you keep the relational part going, you're functionally doing what I call a neural exercise, which means you can visit the states of uh… fight-flight or anger and you can visit the states of immobilization and fear, deep fear. But you can always be brought back out because you still maintain that content, contact. So I, I see that as part of the complex intervention model that you built. And that there are ways in a sense of triggering these very, very deep implicit feelings and then keeping it contained within the relationship. So it's truly a relational model, you keep it contained and then you basically do the neural exercises. And it has similarities with, with uh… David Feinstein's with Energy Medicine, because you're going back in… In David's metaphor, it's a reconsolidation of memory. In my metaphor it's a neural exercise of state regulation. And in your's it's… I don't know what your metaphor would be, but in a sense it's, it's just… 

01:50:40
DAVID GRAND What doing in frame, allows for the self healing inside of the frame. 

01:50:45
STEPHEN PORGES Well, I, I'm just uh… thinking about what, when Rich invited us to do this, he talked in his, in the letter or maybe even in the program about the challenges in psychotherapy which had been basically dualistic set of disciplines, where it was more, in sense cognitive and people live with visceral feelings. And that the future psychotherapy was a more integrated model. And what we all talk about is this, what I call the implicit bodily feelings and then using uh… cognitive or explicit structures whether it's movement, which was my metaphor or pressure which is or a cue points which is your's uh… to trigger feedback loops that move people in and out of different physiological states. So if we start building into a commonality of both your talks, it's that, you, there are technologies that move people into different physiological states. And in those physiological states, they have different access. If access to different uh… regulatory structures. The interesting part is both technologies utilize literally a top down model to pull in very deep implicit feelings. So you whether it's guided imagery, brainspotting or you're using a verbalization of bringing the person to get those feelings. But maintaining that relationship, relational context, so that when they have those feelings or with someone that they feel safe with and both of you have done this marvelous relationship in terms of your clients and where they feel safe with you, which means they can go there without the panic or fear that they can't come back from there. And that's what, that I consider a neural exercises, as what was memory reconsolidation and or in sense the integration of implicit with explicit characteristics of our body. And a lot of people use uh… in the sense of left brain, right brain metaphor. But what we really saying is that they we're becoming more integrated in respecting, witnessing and respecting the feelings that we have without feeling out of control uh… from the neural expectancies, in a sense the associative expectancies, that if we go into those feelings we're gonna be dead. And the beauty of your client in that state was, when you started discussing sleep and this is… I mean, it is so, in the sense uh… such a tutorial because so many people with trauma histories have sleep problems and so many people have sleep problems. What is that telling you? It's telling you that the body is not safe to immobilize uh… it's a simple as that. And I, I often played along with the metaphor. What is uh… the civilization of humanity all about? It's all about the ability to immobilize without fear. And we do various things in our societies. We create rooms with doors, with locks, so that we can sleep, we can be with others in it, we create bathrooms, where we can do bodily functions without being intruded. And we create rooms to eat in. So that we can ingest without being, in a sense violated. And I give another metaphor. Many, how many of you have dogs? Can I see? Okay. And you walk your dog and your dog has to do his bodily functions or her bodily functions. What does your dog do when your dog is unleash? Will look up at you with those big eyes and those big eyes are asking, I have to do something, when I do this I can't protect you and I can't protect myself. You have to protect me, so I can do this. And when you're talking about your clients, and you ask questions about Subdiaphragmatic digestive issues, what do you often find out? People with these trauma histories, constipated air filled bowel, all these issues because their body doesn't feel safe. So we have about five minutes. And we have a choice, we can discuss things among ourselves or should we involve the audience. 

01:54:55
DAVID GRAND Oh! We have one avid question over there. 

01:54:55
STEPHEN PORGES I guess we're involving the audience. 

01:55:00
DAVID GRAND What, what, we're gonna gonna have to repeat what you say. 

01:55:00
UNKNOWN Okay. I was wondering speaking you know uh… being to manage or having umm…the client being able to manage this or going back to manage… Is there… How does the young team (inaudible ) umm… And is there a concern that… 

01:55:30
STEPHEN PORGES So, so I'll, I'll rephrase the question but I'm not gonna answer it, these gentlemen will answer it. The issue is, the techniques that you have seen have been done with adults. And the question is, can you these to deal with young children? Can you use it in a, in a developmental model where these memories aren't even formed as much. So that let, let us hear your… 

01:55:55
DAVID GRAND Uh… we have experts in child therapy who are trained in brainspotting, who then are able to use the brainspotting approach very effectively. And, and here's… The best answer I can give you is, what an adult would take 20 minutes to process through on a spot, a febrile will take 20 seconds to process through on the spot. So not only is it effective with children, it's actually more effective with children, but it's in the context of the creative play therapy process. 

01:56:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN Right. Same, same answer basically, that umm… There's homes for mostly disturbed children that are using it very effectively and umm… it and kids respond really fast. You kind of change the language so that, you know, these are, you know, your, your brain point something like that but it's umm… you know, and, and of course, you need to guide it uh… with an adults or children. You… You're working, when you're working with people that have been traumatize, there are, you know, cliffs you can fall over and you have to be watching for those, but it's um, generally very safe and very uh… very effective. 

01:57:05
STEPHEN PORGES So there's a question back there, yes. Go ahead. 

01:57:15
[sil.] 

01:57:30
STEPHEN PORGES Okay, so you're really asking a question of the different categorizations and classification of trauma histories, trauma experience, from complex to acute, to abuse, to a variety of different things, right? So he want to know whether the therapies are differentially effective for the different kinds. 

01:57:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN I'll tell a story… You know, yesterday was that I was at a conference where we're talking about, where energy psychology can be applied, where it can't, and I, I had said that, I've done a survey of, of practitioners and I had said that I didn't think, I thought that was psychosis for instance, it could help people cope better but it didn't get to curing uh… Schizophrenia. And I put umm…. dissociative, identity disorder into that group. And a woman raised her hand furious, she said you don't know what you're talking about. Where I work, we specialize in working with DID. And since we started the tapping, it's decreased the treatment time form five years to two years. So you really, you really take it a step at a time. You really take, look at the individual pieces but you can accelerate each of those pieces. You don't, you don't throw all from models that you have of, of working with dissociation. You keep those models, but you can use the tapping to de-regulate to get the umm… memories to reconsolidate very rapidly. 

01:59:00
DAVID GRAND Umm… as far as working with Developmental Trauma and I'm sure this is true in, in your work. The most important thing is to be an expert in Developmental Trauma and than to be an expert in Brainspotting, so that you can then integrate brainspotting, in with working with clients with developmental trauma, attachment disorders, disassociative disorders. Umm… uh… we also look in brainspotting as every trauma as being a re-traumatization going back to the original preverbal traumas even, you know, intrauterine traumas. Uh… and, and going to Corrigan's Theory that we are getting to direct access to the, to the superior colliculus uh… that you're going to the place where there are no words that, you know, that the ordinary thoughts is just core just self, which can take you back to really the bottom of developmental trauma. Of course, uh… this brainspotting help you to work with these work through developmental trauma in six months, absolutely not, I mean, uh… you know, not with survivors. The survivors who come to our offices, but it may help the, therapy to be three years instead of five years or five years instead of ten years. Uh… by having the focus the depth to access in the containment that a, that the brain spot and the relation of the human provide together. 

02:00:15
STEPHEN PORGES I have, I have the final question. Sorry. And the final question because this, this is been very intriguing and what I didn't get from both your talks was the duration of treatment. You know, it appears that you could do these things in a session, and I'm wondering are there, is it necessary in some cases, your multiple sessions, you know, five, ten. Uh… tell me the duration of treatment model? 

02:00:40
DAVID GRAND Uh… what you put in is what you get out, and I mean, that that smallest models two sessions which is the first session and then follow-up session, looking at the processing that goes in between the sessions, because that starts when the real change happens. But umm… uh… for the most part people will come to my office, five or ten sessions will be the absolute minimum, and for all of us we have complex trauma brought to our offices, and complex trauma requires complex treatment and even with Power Therapies like this umm… you can get further in less time, but it still takes, takes a good amount of time. 

02:01:20
STEPHEN PORGES Thank you, David. 

02:01:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN For phobias 20 minutes. Often, I think, Callahan really exaggerated when he said five minutes, and is 20 minutes for a simple uncomplicated phobia. I think that as you get into PTSD, as you get into more complex issues, you are, you know, it's not just the tapping, it's a relationship. And so, it becomes relationship to reach, but very accelerated. So umm… five sessions is a lot from, for many things. 

02:01:50
STEPHEN PORGES In building on that, and this is to be our final question. Does do your techniques unleash other traumas as you deal with one that something else pop up. Is it like Wack-A-Mole At the Chuck E. Cheese? 

02:02:05
DAVID GRAND The answer is always, but a lot of the trauma is that, that come up are implicit trauma that don't necessarily become explicit, but that come up symmetrically or, or otherwise and end up getting process to release without it ever becoming explicit. 

02:02:20
DAVID FEINSTEIN The, the metaphor that we use is peeling the onion. You know, you get the top layer and deeper trauma's due come up and you just, you know, like you do, you just stay very attune to what's going on with the person and you deal with whatever emerges. 

02:02:35
STEPHEN PORGES Okay. Well, thank you very much gentlemen. It's gonna jump to… 

02:02:40
