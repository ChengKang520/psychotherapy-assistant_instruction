LINDA JAMES MYERS  Good morning. 

00:00:30
 Good morning. 

00:00:30
LINDA JAMES MYERS  First, let me give honor to the Creator, to the ancestors. Those who have come before upon whose shoulders we stand, and without whose presence and power we would not be. And I give honor to each and every one of you for being here. And most of all I also wanna give honor to Dr. Madonna Constantine for her tireless energy and her work in putting this conference together. And I think we should give her another round of applause.

LINDA JAMES MYERS  I actually owe an apology this morning to uhm, to you all in that I had the brilliant idea I would use an overhead. And then yesterday I said, oh no, no let me do a PowerPoint to uhm, better fit uhm, the occasion ah, with ah, technical things. So long story short, we did the PowerPoint. And then it was easier to do the overheads (laughs). So my overheads are pretty much in disarray in sa, in some ways, but I want us to uhm, to really just kind of fellowship this morning around the chaos that exist in the world today, and the social injustices that are so pervasive in the world today. And so I chose as my topic liberation psychology and education because I think it is true that there is a tremendous need for a liberation psychology and education. So what I wanna do this morning in terms of my presentation is to talk about how we can utilize optimal theory as a model for social justice and empowerment. I don't know how much you know about my theory of optimal psychology and I won't uhm, spend a lot of time elaborating it this morning in our discussion. But rather what I would like to do is to really make four points and elaborate those relative to a liberation psychology and education. First, I'd like to talk about the history of mainstream education and psychology in creating and perpetuating social injustice. And I wanna use the African-American experience an example of that. Then I want to talk about worldview as a possible core of social injustice. How we're seeing the world and how we're creating ah, realities on both individual and collective levels. Thirdly, I want to look beyond the consequences of the cultural and intellectual imperialism that exist in the society today, and the conceptual incarceration that is the outcome of that imperialism and begin to think about how we can get beyond those forces by taking the road to social justice and unity consciousness. I want us to begin to think about how an integral wisdom psychology can serve as, as a liberation psychology. And this liberal, uhm, I'm sorry, this integral wisdom psychology really emerges from ah, optimal theory. And the last but not the least, I wanna discuss overcoming the challenges of increasing social justice ah, by moving to fearless studies, what I call fearless studies. And become the kind of courageous actors that we need to be to address the critical situation that we are experiencing in the world today. And lastly, I want to talk about how we can become the neo, the new freedom conductors for the 21st Century simply because as we think about our past history, and we think about Harriet Tubman who at one point had said, she had, I think been credited with liberating over a thousand slaves. And she said, you know I could've liberated 2,000 if they only knew they were slaves. So we have a full plate this morning in terms of what I hope to accomplish, and uhm, hopefully we'll have time for a few questions ah, at the end of this presentation. What has been the history of mainstream psychology and education in creating social injustice? And how has that particularly impacted people acknowledging African descent in America? Oftentimes, we like to think about education and psychology as the liberating force, but I want us just to take a couple of minutes this morning to entertain if(ph) the reality ah, that many of this experience that in some ways the educational system, whose responsibility it is to socialize members of a culture into the dominant world. You really place that central role in fostering and perpetuating social injustice. How so? Well, when we began to think about the foundations of the mindset, the worldview of the creators of the educational system and the role of the formal educational system plays. One of the things we see is that the foundations are themselves flawed. So that we have a society that has a lot to grapple with in terms of moving toward social justice, simply because the foundations from which we come are grounded at least relative to people acknowledging African descent in legalized terrorism and history of contradictions. So, as a consequence uhm, we have for African(ph) (inaudible ). Oh, I forgot my. 

00:07:15

00:07:15
LINDA JAMES MYERS  Portable mic. As African people in America, we have a warranted mistrust of the dominant culture and its educational system. 

00:07:35

00:07:35
LINDA JAMES MYERS  We con, we're confronted with many problems, not the least of which is education of children, all children. But when we think about African-American children in particular, very serious problems. I just moved to California in September. And one of the things I became aware of is that in California, one out of three children, only one out of three children, graduate from high school. And that was an alarming statistic to me because it should cause us to ask what about the educational system is so disenfranchising that children aren't eager to learn? And what can we begun to do to make the educational system more conducive and inspiring to our children? And one of the things that we're gonna have to look at in order to accomplish this is to begin to think about the role of formal education in the dominant society. As I suggested, the primary function of a formal educational system is to socialize the members of the society into the dominant worldview or mindset of that society. But what happens when the dominant mindset being socialized is one that will ultimately lead the individual, the child to feel inferior? And is it surprising if that mindset is in place that over time, the child or the individual decides, hmm, I really don't want to be involved in this educational system. So we're confronted with the realization that as an institution, formal education is designed to perpetuate the status quo. Well, for African-Americans, what has been the status quo? And I'm using African-Americans an example but the reality it's true for many oppressed groups, actually most oppressed minority groups in the society. We have struggled for quality of education. The education has been a high value in African cultural tradition for a long time. But overtime, there's been erosion, an erosion of that cultural tradition. I'm suspecting pretty much because of the increased socialization into mainstream culture, so that many children today think that to do well in school, to aspire for higher education, is what they characterize as becoming White. So I just want us to, kind of, think about, what is that about? At our, at the deepest level, what must we begin to do as educators and psychologists to turn this kind of thing around. We have a history of racial and cultural bias in the society. And as a consequence, that history doesn't go away. It always is a part of the foundation upon which we have to build. And in acknowledging that, what we see is that to the extent the dominant culture has embraced the worldview that encourages people to be focused materially to such an extent that their own sense of identity and worth becomes based on external criteria. People acknowledging African descent coming from this history of enslavement are going to perpetually be seen as what, less than and inferior simply because the foundation of the society relative to people acknowledging African descent has been one of moving them from chattel to human. Do we ever get beyond this history? I hope so. And so our challenge this morning is to begin to think about how we can get beyond this history. But I guess what I, the point I'm wanting to make elaborating this is to say, you don't get beyond a history like that by what? Oh, I don't see any difference. I don't see any problem. Oh, no, no, everything is fine. We must acknowledge the history and use it for its purpose. Because based upon my theory of optimal psychology, negativity does have a positive purpose in human experience. And the purpose of negativity in human experience is growth, without the challenges, without the problems which we create by the way. There is no growth. And if we begin to acknowledge, oh, something better than what we had before can come from our confronting this, then we'll be out well on our way. So I'm suggesting this morning we have to begin to rethink the so-called achievement gap that exist between uhm, Whites and Blacks in this society, possibly Asians and Whites, so many ah, differences that we see. And as we begin to rethink this, it might be helpful for us to acknowledge our history of pain and suffering, but most importantly the mindset that created the play, pain and suffering. The materialism, the greed, that was the foundation of the, uhm, chattel slavery has to be acknowledged because that same mindset of materialism and greed is alive and well today. I'm one that tends to think at the core of chattel enslavement isn't necessarily racism. Racism becomes a rationalization. At the core is a materialist greed that feels justified in kidnapping people and making them work for you or stealing people's land. And don't we see that materialist greed so pervasive today in this society. Everywhere we turn, we see the inequities, the injustice, the imbalance. So I'm simply wanting us to see the relationship between the foundation from whence we've come and where we are today. And also see that the same mindset that created the problems at the foundation are alive and well today. Different people may be being impacted differently but the foundation is the same. Are you with me? Fine. So in light of that, we have to begin to interrogate our experiences in our role as educators, as psychologists. We know if the purpose of the formal educational system is to socialize members of the society into the dominant worldview. Then as key people in that formal educational system, how do we contribute either wittingly or unwilt, wittingly, and how can we become those neo freedom conductors that I'm suggesting that we need this morning? Clearly, the class structure in the society is fostered by the formal educational system. We really, really, really do place people in the society not only by whether or not they have an education, but also we place them by where they got the education, how much education they got. All of these things feed into the class structure that exist in society. And it's hard for us because all of us, at some level, have been socialized into that same class structure and we all aspire for success. And if we're conscious, we grapple with, hmm, what is the relationship between my success and the perpetuation of the status quo? It really can become a problem and I guess, it becomes more of a problem to someone like me who's very critical of the dominant culture and its pact, impact. So as a person of African and Native American ancestry, I've been very suspicion of it, suspicious of the formal educational system even though I got a doctorate degree and I teach in higher education, spent my entire career doing this, really wondering what can happen? What needs to be done? So, I've taken the risk most of my career to kind of step out and be a little crazy. And begin to talk about things and think about things many people don't talk or think about simply because from my cultural frame, the society we live in is crazy. How do you discover something fully utilized by someone and claim it as your own? How do you talk about building a democracy with freedom and justice for all and have slaves at home? How do you begin to think that you as a human being have the right to enslave another human being? And for us as psychologists it doesn't get much better in that we have a history of having identified Black people who've been very efficacious in trying to liberate themselves as enslaved Africans. We have, our discipline is founded on history that saw those people as insane. We even had a diagnosis, "streptomania(ph)" for slaves who tried to runaway. And we had another diagnosis if they didn't work with enthusiast. So what is the relationship between that foundational history of seeing efficacious healthy behavior of African-Americans as insane. And by the way, I think, we also have a history of seeing insane destructive behavior of African-Americans as sane. We just, kind of, flipped it. But we don't talk about that often. You probably haven't studied that even in many of your multicultural psychology courses, but as an issue is a question because we can't even begin to think about approximating anything like social justice. If we don't fully acknowledge and interrogates the nature of that injustice. And by virtue of the nature of formal education and higher education in particular, you know as a researcher. One of the things you are required to do as you build your own research is to go back and do what? Look what people before you have done. So we have built into the system a way of keeping, recreating the same old missed information as well as new good information as the system goes forward. So what's the challenge? It's a problem. But all is not lost because one of the things we can see is that if indeed it is the mindset, the worldview of dominant socialization that perpetuate social injustice. We can also see that if we change the mindset, we can change the consequences. We can change the ah, outcome. So, what I'm suggesting is that we move toward a different mindset, a different worldview, one which allows us to move toward health, optimal health in a toxic environment. What we need is a comprehensive, cohesive, coherent worldview that ideally would converge with the heights of knowledge across cultural groups. And as we again, begin to pursue that worldview, what we begin to see is that, hmm, there is a convergence across cultural groups, in terms of the heights of knowledge. So that those of us in Western psychology who studied ego psychology and ego development, we're seeing those researchers beginning to talk or having been talking about unity consciousness. Ah, our role in relationship to the creative ground of being. We've also seen Eastern philosophies, which by the way in the broadest perspective, simply become the earliest African Diasporan traditions being manifest throughout the world because we see many of the Eastern philosophies come from people who migrated form Africa. So, we can point to the Dravid, Dravidians in India or the Shang dynasty in China. And we can see how the same consciousness that has its grounds in the wisdom tradition of African deep thought really have been proliferated throughout the world. And why is this important? Why are we even concern about something called the wisdom tradition of African deep thought? Simply because if we're going to move to unity consciousness, we absolutely have to think about what unifies us as humanity. And like it or not, we do have a common history, a common heritage. Of course, most of our thinking doesn't go back to the beginnings of human culture and civilization. Many of us see ourselves as being Ohioans or something far less global. But I'm suggesting to you that if we move toward this comprehensive, cohesive, coherent worldview, we're going to be required to go back and incorporate in our understanding our earliest knowledges, the beginnings of human culture and civilization. And as we begin to do that, we begin to see, as our ancestors wrote as early as 4,000 years ago, that it is not the eyes that see and inform us, it's not the ears that see and inform, it is indeed the heart and mind. And what the heart and mind inform is called forth by the tongue. And that's where all powers, all divine power is created. So, going back to uhm, that wisdom tradition of African desc, deep thought, we can be well-informed about things that we've just come to realize in Western psychology. How many of you have heard about cognitive behavioral theory? 

00:23:25
  If the counseling is here to tell me with the ancestors(ph). 

00:23:30
LINDA JAMES MYERS We all have heard about it, but did we know our ancestors were writing about it 4,000 years ago. So that the, uhm, the quotation that I so badly uhm, stated, I wanna read it more directly so you can just see how we're coming full circle here. It says from the book of knowing the creation of Rah Ish-Tah(ph). By the way, do we know what Rah represents? What is Rah? The sun. And uhm, many people are tricked into thinking that the ancients worship the sun, no. They saw the sun symbolized God. The sun symbolized God simply because on the Earth, plain without the sun, guess what. There's no life. So, the creation of God as Tah. Tah is, is uhm, divine consciousness, "human divine consciousness." And it says the seeing of the eyes, the hearing of the ears, the breathing of the nose are communicated to the heart and mind. And the heart and mind cause all perceptions to come forth. And what the heart and mind wish are declared by the tongue so we're all divine powers created in the company of divine powers completed. Indeed, every word of God came into being through that was the heart and mind thought and the tongue commanded. Thus, by the means of the word, all faculties and qualities, which were fashioned and created, which finished, furnished all food and yield all nourishment, thus justice is given to the one who does what is loved and punishment is given to one who does what is hated. Thus also, is life given to the peaceful and death to those who violate the law. So, we really haven't discovered much new in terms of human culture and civilization. But we have come to some understandings that are new to us in Western civilization. And that's a good thing. But I'm simply trying to argue this morning and challenge us to think beyond the worldview into which we've been socialized and begin to entertain that there is something more that we can come to an understanding. We can realize that can be hopeful to us based upon a unity consciousness which seems to be that consciousness that all cultural groups have converged around, be they Western people, people we characterize as Eastern, or African common descents. What we're looking for then is that kind of cyclical synthesis and balance of emotional, physical, spiritual, affective, and socio-economical liveness with a protective layer of individual, familial, communal, and cultural beliefs and practices. In other words, we want to create or introduce the kind of worldview that would allow us to see that who we are is not or cannot be based on external criteria, but rather who we are is intrinsic in being, we're worthy simply because we are, because we are the expressions, individual and unique of an infinite creative force and power. And so being, our identity isn't added to or taken away from by how we look, our income, our position, the clothes we wear, where we live. All of those things are good things to pursue but they have to be seen in the context of this worldview that allows us to know that we are intrinsically worthy. Because if we don't come from this place, of what I'm calling an optimal worldview, we are at risk to be victims of the sub-optimal. We're at risk to the anxiety and fearfulness that comes with trying to gain a sense of identity and worth based on external criteria. We're at risk to the challenges of always being in the position of trying to get more. So, the way the society is structured, we think well you know, I'd be fine if I just had more money. And we get more money and what happens? Well, I'd be fine if I got more money. So, we just get more and more, more, and you never get enough in that system. Not only do you never get enough in that system, in the process of getting more, you're anxious, you're stressed, you're depressed. You become fearful. So, we see many of the stress and anxiety problems that confront people in the society that also bring us bank, 'coz they're gonna come and get therapy, of course, right, to deal with. But many of those anxieties and, and, and depressions that people experience are simply a function of the worldview of dominant socialization. Not only are those mental health maladies of function of that worldview, but also chemical dependency, because the society setting us to look outside ourselves for something to ingest to make us feel better. So, we see people constantly taking something to impact some symptom they're experiencing. Oh, I got a headache, some aspirin. Oh, I got an upset stomachs, some Alka-Seltzer. Oh, I can't sleep, some Nidol. Oh, I can't get up. So, it makes sense then with that kind of socialization when someone comes along and says, you know, I have something that'll make you feel on top of the world. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it's illegal. People will go for it. And they'll go for it not just like we see on TV, poor low income Blacks, but what? By the way, what happened to that war on drugs? Dr. Constantine, did we win it? 

00:30:05
 (inaudible ). 

00:30:07
LINDA JAMES MYERS We don't hear much about it anymore, right? Oh, no, no, no. We got the war on terrorism now, right? 

00:30:10
 That's right. 

00:30:10
LINDA JAMES MYERS We can only do one war at a time. It's serious, so I'm being, I'm joking but it's quite serious. The mindset and the outcomes and the consequences that are directly the result of this faulty mindset and worldview that I'm talking about. We also see violence as an outcome. Because when people are anxious and frustrated, they get angry. And who do they take their rage out on? Most likely those people closest to them. So domestic violence is pervasive in the society and not only domestic violence but also ah, now we're into global violence. And now, we have a war on terrorism and that war on terrorism is particularly problematic because at some point we become the chief terrorist. So what happens when we're so indoctrinated into a mindset that doesn't allow us to see that we're the chief perpetrators of the thing we fear the most. So in our efforts to be safe and secure, we determine we must go to destroy a people who had nothing to do with 9/11. And we think or we tell ourselves that by doing that, we are making Americans safe. Not realizing every innocent person that is killed becomes another potential terrorist. Simply because that anger, that injustice that we're perpetrating is gonna what? Come back. So I'm arguing for a comprehensive, cohesive, coherent worldview that allows us to see that whatever we send out, guess what? It's coming back. And if we follow the ancient sacred text called the Bible, not only is it, is it coming back, it's coming back what? A hundred-fold? So just being mindful that the worldview unto which we've been socially, shelf(ph), socialize is problematic. And I talk about it as a suboptimal worldview. It has tremendous cost and the cost are costs that we can ill-afford to continue to pay. But enough of the problem, let's think about getting beyond the consequences of the kind of cultural and intellectual imperialism, and, and conceptual incarceration that keep us tied to that faulty worldview. Well, one of the things that it has to happen is that we begin, we have to begin to make sure that we're always questioning and learning to think for ourselves. Think for yourself and then you will create that what you think. Follow the dominant culture socialization and think what the dominant culture would like you to think, and then you become a perpetuator of social injustice. I recently viewed a film called, it was a BBC, BBC documentary called a Century of the Self. And in that film, they talked about the impact of Freud and psychoanalytic theory on American society. They also talked about Freud's nephew, Edward Bernays. And the film portrays the role of Bernays as what they say or describe as the creator of public relations. And what Bernays did is take Freudian, the Freudian idea that human beings have weaknesses, that if you identify and exploit, you can control them. And so he built this whole field of propaganda which he later changed to public relations because propaganda took on such a negative connotation. And really began to be the leader to create for uhm, let's see how can I say it, the uhm, capitalists uhm, a method to control the masses. So his idea was if you can get people to switch from pur, making purchases based on need to making purchases based on the idea of what they purchase makes them a better person, then you can just really be successful in terms of marketing your goods. Interestingly, according to the documen, documentary, not only was this model used in industry and business, it also has been used in politics. So, it talks about how psychological theory is used to control the masses. And that was such an interesting film to me because, because of the research I've been engaged in. I've always thought that, that worldview of materialism and consumerism ah, was directly the result of faulty assumptions. But I didn't know necessarily there were specific people in the world sitting down, figuring out, oh, let's do this. Let's manipulate people. That was sad to me but it was also a positive because if a group of people can sit down and figure out how we can pray on the weaknesses of humanity, why can a group of people sit down and figure out how we can build upon the strengths of humanity. They talked about how Freudian theory uhm, was marketed by Bernays. And one of the commentators says, well you know, Freud became very popular. You don't think it was this, the psychologist and psychiatrist in research, researchers that popularized Freudian theory, it was his publicist (laughs), his nephew. So, that led me to another thought, I was in hmm, maybe what we need to do particularly as those multicultural psychologist interested in social justice is to begin to market based on touching and reaching the height of humanity's instincts. The kind of thinking, the kinds of behaviors that would support the development of social justice. We have to overcome a very difficult history. But in doing that, if we can acknowledge the impact of the predatory system of social organization and the humanization that's been prevailing. If we can begin to acknowledge and overcome the history of misrepresentation and exploitation and oppression, and begin to entertain the need for healing and reconciling those contradictions, we'll be well on our way. The field of psychology also has much to be proud about because, particularly counseling psychology has taken the lead in terms of being inclusive of multicultural worldviews. My own work and that of others in the field of Black psychology, I think, also has a lot to be proud of in terms of beginning to think or rethink and expand our notions of the human psyche and its potential, potentialities and possibilities. We have to question many of the ideas in mainstream psychology as to whether they're really depicting the true nature of human nature or they simply depicting what we believe based on the dominant worldview. We also have to begin to become more critically self-reflective and introspective in terms of ourselves. And begin to examine the unconscious levels at which the monocultural hegemony of the dominant system sips in and pervades our own thinking and our own experience. Optimal theory posits the interrelatedness and the interdependence of all things. As such, social justice will be achieved. When we learn to reason di-unitally. When we learn to reason in such a way that our conclusions are, well, either this is right or that is right, but rather our reasoning allows us to see, oh, this is correct from that perspective but this other point of view is also correct from its perspective. We need to develop that di-unital reasoning, di-unital logic. We have to become open to a comprehensive, cohesive, coherent worldview and its implications for individual and collective good. We need to seek to represent the righteous forces. You see, one of the things that is true when you begin to see the world as spirit of material unity when you begin to get in touch with that aspect of yourself that is spirit, you begin to see that you he, are here representing. And you're representing certain forces. Those forces can be of a positive nature, a righteous nature, or a negative nature. And how you're representing isn't coincidental. The fact that an individual may be representing as ah, male or female, Black or White, tall or short, based on optimal theory is important only to the extent there's a reason. In fact, optimal theory posits that chance is a law unrecognized, very much like those ancients sages such as Tah who said, "when you see anything in nature and experience, you must know when your examination becomes deep enough and full enough and complete that there is a law and a reason for everything". We can begin to think about practicing what I call the optimization process. The optimization process is just a simple idea which says, if I come to the place of realizing myself as an expression of that divine infinite and I come from a place where I'm feeling connected to those who've come before, those who'll come after, nature, my community. Then from that space, I can feel my intrinsic worth. And in feeling my intrinsic worth, I must know that when I'm separated from that sense, that separation is coming for a purpose. Much like I said earlier, the purpose of that separation which will be experienced as negativity, which will be experienced as a feeling of fear, a feeling of shame, guilt, anger, whatever that negative feeling is. The purpose of that feeling is to bring me to conscious awareness of those things which I'm thinking, which I'm telling myself, which I'm assuming is true that are really flawed and faulty, so that I can begin to interrogate those things and come back to my true self clearer, stronger, in fuller appreciation of who I am, what I am, and the lesson that I've mastered. If we take that process orientation to everything that comes into our experience, we are guaranteed a perpetual win win. Early on, when I developed optimal theory, my colleague used to ask, well Linda, where is the negative in there? I mean, it, you know, it's good stuffs, interesting and good, but where is the dark side? And I would say, well, you know, we know it's there because you can't have one without the other. Well, I hadn't lived long enough to really experience (laughs) some of the negativity. But guess what, you live long enough, you'll get a few of those experiences. And having had them, what I realize now is that it is true. They come for a positive purpose. And you can't develop self-mastery if you've mastered nothing. So, we have to begin then to see those challenges as opportunities, as blessings ultimately so that we can go forward. Why would we wanna even do that? Why would we wanna even engage in that way? Well, I'm suggesting this morning that it's necessary for overcoming the challenges that we see in terms of the increasing social injustice. So, I'm arguing this morning what we need is a fearless studies. Why do i say a fearless studies? Well, there's so much of the human condition we simply don't touch particularly as educators and psychologists or social scientists that we really are going to have to develop the courage to interrogate. Not the least are some of the spiritual aspects of being in the levels of consciousness, and the dimension of human experience that typically we're taught, oh, we, you can't look at that. You can't study that. For example, Clayton and Berg found in looking at the history of health among African-Americans that African-Americans were healthier when they were fighting social justice. The number of illnesses, the impact of the illnesses they experienced, actually was lower when we were fighting for social justice. So, I'm taking that to mean there's something healthy about fighting. For that which is right and just and good. But in doing that, we need to focus on moral development and spiritual leadership. We need the kind of training that would inspire fearlessness and courage. Courage to eradicate pain and suffering, oppression, and discrimination. Courage to defend human rights and the rights for free self-expression. Courage to pursue empowerment and actualization. And as we begin to develop ourselves and get that courage, then the social injustice that we see has to begin to ameliorate because if nothing else, it's no longer supported by our own consciousness and experience. How am I doing for time? Okay. What we need are neo freedom conductors. The new freedom conductors of the 21st Century. We need them to recognize another way of being in the world much like our ancestors and indigenous people understood. We need them to begin to feel connected to the multiple dimensions of life. So, as part of the inspiration required for this new freedom conduction, conductors, I'm advocating for spiritual activism. The kind of spiritual activism that allows us to bring forth and surround ourselves with the kind of security we need to have courage to stand up. I saw a film during Black history month about Martin Luther King and he, ah, we all recognize he was great moral leader. And in the film, I'm sorry, in the, in the lecture he gave right before his death, when he talked about having been to the mountain top and, and have, having seen the other side. You could see on his face in that film he had seen death. He had seen something beyond what we normally appercept. And that wasn't the kind of fear that oftentimes we experience as we challenge in just forces in the society. So, optimal theory, optimal psychology can become a vehicle to support us, to get beyond that fear. We need to develop practices and rituals to support that. We need to honor ah, whatever spiritual practices can be accessed to support us in our move to liberate the minds and hearts and spirits of oppressed people. We need to find all the good. I wanna share with you uhm, the words from one Shaman's invocation ah, from ah, Native American culture. And it honors the six directions. So, it begins by saying, "To the winds of the south, great sep, serpent, wrap your coils of light around us. Teach us to shed the past the way you shed your skin. Teach us to walk softly on the earth. Teach us the beauty way. To the winds of the west, mother jaguar, protect our meadows and, meadows and space. Teach us the way of peace to live impeccably. Teach us the way beyond death. To the winds of the north, humming birds, grandfathers, grandmothers, ancient ones, we honor you who've come before. Come warm your hands by our fires. Whisper to us in the wind. We honor you who've come before and you will who come after, our children's children. To the winds of the east, great eagle, come to us from the place of the rising sun. Keep us under your wing. Teach us to fly beyond mountains we never dreamed of. Teach us to fly wing to wing with the great spirit. Mother earth, we gather here for the healing of all your relation, our relation. The stone people, the plant people, the four legged, two legged, finned, furred, creepy crawlers, and the winged ones, we honor you. To the star nation, grandfather sun, grandmother moon, great spirit, you who are known by a thousand names and you who are the unnamable one, thank you for allowing us together and sing the song of life." I know I move better through life and space when I gather those forces and those presence. And as I do that, the fear leaves and the courage comes. And as I begin to embrace this comprehensive, cohesive, coherent worldview that sus, can sustain in real practical, logical, reason terms, then I can go forth and create social justice. I have achieved as I do this that integral wisdom. That wisdom essential to wholeness, which allows me to practice and to move. When I first developed the theory of optimal psychology, I thought it was very much coming to me from the ancestors. And being the worldview that I am, when ah, Maulana Karengment, Karenga sent me a copy of the Odu E-file, which is the Yorubas ancient sacred text, I said, "Oh, ancestors show me where optimal theory fits in this history." And don't you know the book falls open to the 78th Odu. The 78th Odu is the Odu where the people are asking, Oludumare. "When can we rest in heaven? We're tired going back and forth between heaven and earth." And Oludumare says, "You can rest in heaven when all the good is found. When there's no more fear. No more anxiety. No more injustice, when people are no longer a fearing issue, then you can rest in heaven." So, I'm charging you this morning to become that neo freedom conductor who will allow us to liberate the hearts, minds, and spirits of oppressed people and bring justice to the planet. And allow us to find all the good because in actuality, the good is there despite appearances. In that process we'll have to honor that each of us in our own way, as unique, special and invaluable, that everybody's right to the limits of their knowledge, wisdom and understanding based on the experiences, exposures, and meanings they have made of what has come in to their experience. And as we begin to move in that direction, I know we will find within ourselves the fearlessness and the courage and we'll be in a position to operationalize in our communities, in the environments where we find ourselves these understandings and these ideas. When I threw out to the universe the call to bring me the people who want to fight for justice and equality, that's what led me to my new position at New College of California. They have as their uhm, mission, education for just, sacred, sustainable world. I said, "okay I'll come." So, it's all good. It truly is all good despite appearances but there's a lot of work to be done. And in order to get that work accomplished, we have to have to have to become fearless. And just like Harriet Tubman was fearless, she didn't know her way from the slave states to the free states, but what she knew was what? Her connection to that divine inspiration. That's all I'm suggesting this morning. Let's just focus on getting that connection and, and we don't have to be in religious circles to do it. It's actually psychology. At least that's my position. And as we begin to really engage and embrace the interrogation of that psychology, every question is a good question. All negative comes for a positive purpose. We really, really, really can begin to create the kind of transformation in our own experiences, in our own communities and families, that we need for a just, sacred, sustainable world. Thank you.
