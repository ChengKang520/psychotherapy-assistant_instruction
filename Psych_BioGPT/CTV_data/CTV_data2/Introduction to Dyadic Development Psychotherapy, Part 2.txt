ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The stages of treatment and, and, there is no sort of magic to this, but it's s a way to think about treatment and as you go through treatment, umm… where you are and it becomes important because you, you use all of the same methodologies and techniques and, and, and concepts that Dan talked about earlier, but in a slightly different mix depending where you are, uh, in, in treatment. Umm… you know, for example, earlier in treatment, working on building the alliance, working on developing trust, creating the secure base, umm… is much more important because you need to create that before you can do some of the other pieces and how long that takes depends on a whole variety of issues, but it's useful to think about that. Umm… later in treatment, for example, and I'll walk through the stages in a moment, but later in treatment for example, umm… as Dan described earlier, you can do a bit more, umm… forceful leading, not pushing, but forceful leading, why? Because you have some degree or well of, uh, trust that's developed. There is a sense on the part of the parents as well as the child, that what you're doing is to be helpful, in other words, their understanding of your motivation has changed overtime, right? Initially, the parents maybe skeptical as the child about what's your real motivation? Why you want to talk about these things later in treatment? There is a greater sense of what your motivations are through the intersubjective experiences that you create. So you, you want to keep that in mind in terms of how you operate. Just like, umm… how many of you would willingly let someone poke needles in your gums and, umm… you know, ricket your teeth and, and do all kinds of stuff like that, probably not many of you. However, if you thought, oh, well, the person is doing this because, umm… I have a, uh, infected tooth and you're gonna making me feel better, you rightly sit in the dentist chair and you let the dentist do all this stuff to you, why? Because you believe his or her motives are to help you, not to hurt you, right? So that's important. So stages, again, no magic to it, but, umm… initial engagement and this… these may occur over several sessions or these may occur within a session, again depending on the nature of the family and the parents. Umm… first with parents, uh, then parent and child. Uh, parents really are key. They're the linchpin, umm… to treatment success. They really… I, I do fairly extensive assessments, but the best predictor really of treatment outcome is the parents, that's the best predictor, not how disturbed is this child, but really the parents' capacity to engage and concordant inter-subjective experiences, okay. Dan described what are inter-subjective Experiences? You can think about them in terms of being concordant or discordant, right? Either all… In fact, it's a useful model when you're working with someone, if something isn't working well to try to think about which of the three dimensions of inter-subjectivity is out of sync. Okay, so, if one or more of them is out of sync then you have discordant inter-subjective experiences. So, umm… the simple example of what that might look like. You're playing a game with a child and umm… so at that moment, what, you have, umm… uh, shared emotion, right? And you're both having fun and… But then all of a sudden, the child you're playing with, throws the board up in the air and starts screaming at you and stomps out of the room. And you think, what in the world happened. You know, I thought we were having a good time and thinking about the three dimensions of inter-subjectivity, what you might come to and say, well, we were having fun, shared emotion. I certainly had shared intention, uh, attention, shared focus. We were focused on the board, the game, uh, I thought we had shared intention. I mean, I just enjoy this child, I enjoyed playing with, games with them, I like seeing them having fun and then it dawns on you. Oh, you know what? For this child winning or losing is the most important thing and when they lose they feel bad about themselves. And I was just playing the game, I didn't realize I was winning and obviously we had different motivations. So then it allows you to figure out what to do, if you understand where the disconnect is among the three elements of inter-subjectivity, it allows you as a parent or as a therapist to then think about how do I do the repair and what does the repair need to be about. Uh, maintaining the working alliance is sort of the next step beginnings, working through middle stages, these are the, uh, this is the part of treatment where things like, umm… psychodramatic reenactments might occur, umm… cognitive behavioral interventions might be appropriate at this point. Integration late stages and then, uh, ending, and I'll go through of these in, in just a moment. Umm… first, establishing an alliance with the parents is key. It's important. First of all, children live with the parents and so they really are the, uh, major therapeutic vehicle. So your developing an alliance with the parents is crucial, umm… in, in some regards, you may become an attachment figure for the parent. Umm… and then together, you and the parent become attachment figures, create a secure base, uh, for the child. Umm… part of the way you're develop an alliance with the parents is helping them understand what the goals are, and I'll talk a moment… a bit about that in a moment. And providing information about parenting, right? In part, parents have come to you because they've tried everything they know and everything that makes sense to them, and maybe everything that worked for them, when they were being raised, but it's not working. And that's why they're coming to you, okay? To learn about other ways of, of managing the situation so that they can be, what, their goal is to be affective parents and to have a certain kind of a set of family relationships. Umm… process, umm… I find… and this may not be true for everybody, but I generally find, umm… sessions between an hour and a half and two hours seem to work best, umm… because if you think about all of the things Dan talked about earlier, umm… this is not a, umm… you know, uh, uh, uh, menu driven model of treatment, where we've got to do these three things and if you just, sort of, say A, B, C and D, we've completed that session. It's not a, uh, uh, it's not manualized in, in that sort of way. To create the kinds of experiences that were talked about earlier takes time. And so I find for having an hour and half, two hour sessions. First of all, it allows me not to feel rushed, so I can take all the time that I need. Second of all, it allows me, the way I usually do that is first I meet with the parents, so we get a chance to talk, you know, you get a chance to work with them, help them, uh, feel, accepted, understood, develop empathy for them, umm… then we all meet together, then I meet with the parents at the end to kind of brief and, and talk about the session. The meeting at the beginning is also important because sometimes parents will come and they, they'll say, you can't believe what happened last week, right? And they tell me what happened, right? And they sometimes rant and rave about, you can't believe. She hit me, she bit me, you know, I don't know if I can keep this kid anymore, right? And if you can provide an accepting environment, where they can share those experiences with you, and those feelings and you can have empathy for them. They'll eventually come to understand them, calm down and be in a different place when you all get together 'cause certainly you wouldn't want to start a session with the child… with the parent saying that, right? Uh, the other thing just to, kind of, it occurred to me at some point, umm… later. How many of you have, umm… brothers or sisters that you grew up with? There, okay. Umm… when you had an altercation with your brother or sister, right? Tell me if I'm wrong. Both of you would run to your parents to tell them what happened, right? And it wasn't usually true whoever got there first, that's the story the parents started with, why did you hit your sister? Right? Even though it might not have started that way, but they start with whatever they hear first, right? So in some ways, when parents have a chance to tell you their view, what happened, you know, what they perceived, you sort of have the same dynamic. So in the session, I find they're much more comfortable sitting back, letting the child talk, they don't feel like they have to interrupt it. No, I didn't say that. No, no, no, remember, you did this first, right? Because they know, you know, from their point of view they got to you first, you know the story. So they often feel they're, they're just more able to sit back and listen, they feel more relaxed. If they feel more relaxed, they're gonna be more open to other ideas. Umm… so there are whole variety of reasons why I, I personally find that that useful. Umm… parents and residential, uh, workers are actively involved in the session. So if the child is in residential treatment, their primary residential staff worker is in each session, parents are in each session, why? Because as you've heard, umm… us talk about… as you've heard Dan talked about in the morning, the nature of the difficulties are primarily relational in nature, right? And the difficulties primarily are relationship difficulties. So what you're treating is the relationship, right? And to treat the relationship, you need it in front of you, so you need the people there. Umm… we talked about… Dan talked about this earlier, active affective, reflective dialogue, essential to this meaning, emotions and cognitions in an integrated manner. And of course, coercion is just not an aspect of treatment, umm… there is nothing an attachment theory that lead you to… that would lead you to even think about that, but just to make, you know, make that clear, umm… and as Dan described in the follow, lead, follow, right? The words are very important. It's not push, it's lead. There is a difference between pushing and leading, right? Umm… when Dan was talking about that I was thinking, umm… couple of weeks ago, my son and I went scuba diving, umm… on a wreck, he hadn't been on. And so he said, "Okay, dad, you, you know, you lead, umm… I'll follow." Umm… so in leading, I wasn't in front of him, him following me, why? Because in that configuration, I'd, I'd have no idea if I lost him, leading men… really being next to each other, umm… and me kind of showing the way to go, but not, not away out ahead of him, but right next to him, so I could see how fast was he swimming, you know, was he doing okay, was he paying attention to, you know, if I curved off in one way, okay, so following is not, I mean, leading is not pushing, okay, leading means being next to the person, so it's not coercive. Therapeutic Goals, uh, development of attachment security, including accepting comfort, discipline, managing conflict and relationship repair. Umm… resolution of trauma and loss, you can… How many did you have to do, umm… periodic treatment progress reports every 60, 90 days, yeah. You can just copy this slide, put it in your case file and, sort of, check things often and you'll do perfectly fine with your managed care and, and your, your administration. And development of affect regulation, reflective functioning, coherent narrative, reciprocal relationships, and empathy, and all of these things come from a relationship. A colleague of mine has a phrase and I use it all the time because I like it a lot, which is that, "It's about connections, not compliance." "It's about connections, not compliance." It's about the relationship. It's not that compliance isn't important, but the way you get compliance is through connections. Just a really, uh, uh, quick story, umm… I always tell stories about my son, umm… my oldest, who is… my daughter would I think, yell at me if I tell stories about hers, but my son is better with that. Umm… when he was in middle school, if he did something we didn't' like, we take away screens, no TV, no video games, no computers, okay. That was just, you know, didn't happen that often, but that was sort of what we did. Anyway, he was home from college, uh, one day, he was in his junior year, and he did something, I forget, I didn't like. And, and David is about my height, he probably weighs about 25, 30 pounds more than me, you know, he works out, he is a, uh, you know, healthy guy. And he did something. I didn't like and said, "That's it, David, no screens for the weekend." And he looked at me and said, "Dad, can you do that?" And I said, "Yeah, I'm your dad." And you could see the wheel spinning in his head, thinking oh, no screens. I guess that means I don't have my computer, can't use my cell phone and then he calls up stairs, you know, "Mom, dad said I can't have, you know, screens for the weekend." And my wife, you know, bless her heart, she screams down, "Oh, your dad is a moron, don't listen to him." But, but there was that 30 seconds, or not even, maybe 15 seconds where you could see, he, he was thinking, oh, man, no screens for the weekend, why? Because it's about connections, it's about relationships, not about compliance. You get that, you get adherence to what you'd like, through the relationship. Okay, just to… back up a second, umm… behavioral modification approaches, star chart, sticker charts, what… why do they work? They only work because the check or the star or the point of the reward is the surrogate for the parents' approval. So if relationships have no currency, have no value, if they're frightening, if they're disturbing, if they're upsetting, then of course, those kinds of things don't work, okay. They only work because of a relationship that was built overtime. Okay. Uh, a couple of things I go over with parents in the first session, again, you're getting kind of a quick high level, uh, overview of, umm… of what we go over or what I go over. Umm… I can't go into a lot of detail, umm… but typical first session, after I've done an assessment when I meeting with the parents, talk a bit about, umm… what we focus on treatment, not symptoms. It's not that behavior is not important, but if we're gonna address behavior in a way that's meaningful, we have to understand what's causing it, right? Because we treat causes not symptoms. We treat causes, not symptoms. So we want to look at what's driving the behavior and all behavior has meaning. When you see something in a family that makes no sense to… that seems bizarre, weird, that reflects our lack of empathy 'cause if we really understood what the person was experiencing and saw the world through their eyes, it would make sense, that there would be a logic to it, okay. So we have to understand… A quick story, umm… a friend of mine, umm… when he had his first child, a son, he wanted to do it right. You know, get ready for when his son asked him about the birds and bees, so he read all these books and he got ready, you know, and he was prepared. 'Cause his dad, he said, hadn't done it very well. And then one day, uh, he was about five years old, the boy, they were coming home from grandma's house. And as they are walking in house, the boy looks to his dad and says, umm… "Where did we come from?" And my friend said, "I was so happy, I've been preparing for this day for years, I've been practicing…" said, "Come on, son." I brought him in the living room. I sat him on my knee. I gave him a three minute talk about the birds and bees and used all the right words and everything. It was perfect. And he… You know, my son saying and nodding his head, it was great. And then my son looked at me and said, "Okay, dad but, umm… where did we come from? Where does grandma live?" Okay, the dad answered the wrong question, okay. So we want to understand what's driving the behavior, what's causing it, that's what we focus on. Psychological safety is crucial for affective therapeutic exploration and integration. So parents have to feel safe, not judged and children have to feel safe, not judged. It's our job to create that safety. If there isn't safety, there is our job to create it. And when we make mistakes, it's our job to umm… acknowledge those mistakes, okay. Because that's how we model for the parents, how we do that, umm… again, quick, quick example. I was sitting with a boy and his mom and it was like our second session. We were talking… I think about his birth mom, it was a while, I don't remember all the details. But one of the things this boy did was he would injure himself, like he pick at scabs, umm… sometimes he'd, he'd make his nose bleed. Anyway, umm… we're talking about his birth mom. And next thing I know he's picked his nose, he made it bleed and he's wiping it on my sleeve over here because his mom is there. So I'm just curious, uh, at this point from what you've heard, what would you do at that point? What would you say at that point? Throw something out… 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:18:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's a good thing. Any other ideas? Oh, come on, you're sitting… 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:18:47
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What's that? 

00:18:47
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:18:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, well, yeah, yeah, because… Yeah, I don't mind, okay. All good ideas. So what I… Oh, go ahead. 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN My husband probably say something about that we were talking about bring hard and I could tell that he is doing this and I probably also get to teach him to save money, (inaudible ). 

00:19:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So, okay. All very good ideas. What I… Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN I just wonder why (inaudible ) I would wonder that there is a kind of relationship there to share (inaudible ). 

00:19:18
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Obvious. Why would you wipe blood on yourself? You know, what I mean? So I said, good. I didn't thought about that one. But what I did was I turned to him and said, "Andrew, I'm really sorry, I didn't realize how hard this was for you. I'm sorry about that." Am I right? Is this, and he, you know, nodding his head, see I don't like talking about those things about my birth mom. I said, oh, I'm really glad you told me, umm… you know, I'm sorry, I didn't notice, then you had to do this. And then we went on from there, and changed… and I changed the subject, I said, "Should we talk about something else?" He said, "Yeah." I said, "Great." What, you know, we moved onto something else. Okay, why? Umm… yeah, something I don't like what he was doing, but had been more attuned, more, uh, connected with his experience at that moment. I would have recognized that he was getting disturbed, and either would have said, is this bothering you? Can we go on? Helped him put into words his experience, so that he wouldn't have had to have shown me, right? He did… He couldn't tell me. He didn't have the ability to tell me what he was experiencing, but he showed me. So anyway, umm… that's creating psychological safety is important. Umm… I always, uh, In their very first session with parents, say to them when we get together with your, umm… as a family, you know, we're gonna to be talking about a lot of different things and of course, you're, you're umm… you're here because you like your family to be happier place, better place. If I see you doing something that, umm… might not be the most helpful thing at the moment, can I just interrupt you, is that okay? And, you know, of course, at that point nothing has happened and parents, you know, oh, yeah, you know, take your shoe off, throw at me, smack me on the head. And say why again. I don't think I would do that. But I said, would it be okay? Would it, you know, be, umm… would you feel disrespectful if I said could you just hang on a moment. And most, you know, parents say, that's great, go ahead and do that. And I do that, partly, so that if that happens they know my motivation. I'm not being rude, I'm trying to be helpful, when I say oh, could you hang on a moment with that. But the other reason I do that is, umm… I generally try to be polite, I don't like to interrupt people, we've probably… I've had this experience a lot. Somebody starts something in a session and I'm thinking, oh, my God, this is going in the wrong direction, I wish it would stop. Well, by having this conversation, I feel more comfortable to intervene much more quickly. So partly, it's for the parents, partly, it's again to help me, uh, be therapeutic. Okay, and then you're focused, developing and maintaining the relationship, okay. What makes this model, I think, really, umm… beautiful in many ways is that you're using yourself. So how you develop and maintain the relationship is a reflection of who you are. So if you are an art therapist, you may use more media, you know, if you, uh, like certain things, you bring that into, umm… your treatment, okay. And each of us have a different style, it's how we use ourselves. It's not so much the what you do, it's the how you do it, that's really important. ACE, everybody want's to be an ACE, right? So in this case, that means being accepting, curious, and having empathy. That's the heart at PACE, okay, being an ACE therapist, being accepting, right, of the feelings, of the motivations, being curious in an authentic way, not, I want to get the truth out of you, but in a way that I'm really interested in you. You know, I really want to know what you think, I find that fascinating, okay. Partly, to do that, you have to have, I describe it as an open mind or at least be somebody who doesn't, umm… who can maintain a lot of different ideas in your mind at the same time, right? If you know the answer, it's very difficult to ask the question in the way that really is curious, right? If you're really kind of, well, could be this or could be that or could be the other thing, then you can ask it in a way that is inviting and, umm… by asking questions in a, in that sort of way, that's a non-verbal way that we demonstrate to somebody that we value them, right? Because we're using our time to find out about them. I mean, we think about it. How many of you ever been to a party? Anybody here, really, no. How many of you have been to a party? Okay, better. Okay. How many of you have ever been to a party where someone cornered you and for 10, 15 minutes they told you about their house, their car, their job, their money, their this or their that at the other, okay, right? When, when you see them again at the next event, what do you do? You avoid them like to plague, okay. Change the picture. You had a party, someone comes up to you and for 10 or 15 minutes, they say what do you do, you say, oh, I'm a therapist. Really? What would you do? Oh, I work with kids with experienced trauma, they come there with the child welfare system. Really? How did you get interested in that? Wow, that's really hard work. Okay. What do you when you see that person at the next event? 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:24:37
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. You say, hey, come on over, good to see you again, right? Why? Because they made you feel valued, valuable, important, special, all of the things that we want to feel, all the things we would like feel. So the way you, umm… in that curiosity is a nonverbal way of demonstrating that you value the person and then that eventually leads to empathy. If you ask questions in that sort of way and come to understand the person's view then, oh, now it makes sense, now I get it. Now I see why you might have done that. Okay. Umm… let's see, what else. Umm… in… With the parents, often I will talk with them about it's useful. The more time they can spend with the child, the closer they can keep them at home the better. Because to develop concordant inter-subjective experiences takes getting to know the child and picking up on the subtle cues, right? How many of you have had, umm… babies in your home, raised babies, ever? Okay. True, within 46 weeks, you could tell the difference between the, I'm wet cry and the I'm hungry cry, right? True. Maybe your in-laws couldn't, but you could, right? That's the level of sensitivity, attunement, umm… that that we want to be creating and that takes time. So often, umm… often I will recommend that if it's possible, the parents have the child at home with them on a full time basis to help develop that, because it can just develop more quickly. Umm… school issues, I often suggest let the school handle school issues. Your primary goal now is relationship, okay. Relationship, anything that gets in the way of the relationship, is going to be an obstacle towards making things better. So your focus is on relationship and that conclude reassure parents that if the school can handle things in the way you're comfortable with, it's fine, I very, very, very, very, very, very, very rarely had a child actually have to repeat a school year, okay. So again, that often helps reassure, uh, parents. Uh, we talk a little bit and I will begin to talk about their own attachment history, umm… one of the questions I always like to ask, especially if it's a couple, of all the things your child does, what is it that the child does that most irritates you? And, you know, they have something and then I'll say, oh, and what about for you. And usually, they're different things. And then the next sort of question becomes, that's really interesting. So what is it about you, you think that makes that bother you and what is it about that makes that bother you to just get them to begin to think about, buttons, it's your button, right? It's your button. The child maybe pushing it, but it's your button. I had a dad describe to me once, umm… he said, you know, this is his 12-year-old daughter. He said, you know, Mariah, she can push my buttons and she can get me going in 10 seconds flat, she can get me cranked up. It's unbelievable. And then he paused and said, but you know, I guess if I'm gonna to be a good dad for Mariah, I'm gonna have to figure out how it disconnect that button. And I thought, this is great, this is perfect 'cause that's true. It's true. Umm… again, this is relationship focused, it's, uh… about connections, not compliance, okay. Umm… therapists maintain a healing pacer treatment, parents maintain a healing place, the child lives with them, okay. Umm… parenting at home basics, right, safety, umm… focusing on success making the home a positive home, a joyful home, needs to be structured, supervision in the sense of you want to recognize where is the child developmentally and, umm… work, you know, interact with them, where they're developmentally, does no good to try to get a developmentally 6-year-old to act like a 14-year-old, it's just not gonna happen, right? You'll be unhappy as a parent and your child will be frustrated. Soothing, story telling tone. So these are all the kind of things you want to do and then on the other side, umm… are all the things you, you want to avoid. Shame, obviously shouting, right? Umm… even physical discipline, right? You want to avoid that, umm… shoulds all of these things, sarcasm. Okay? Okay, so stages, umm… I mentioned those, what I want to do is go through each one of them, umm… briefly, and talk about what your primary tasks are in that stage and then, umm… sort of, methods or approaches within it. Yeah, there is no magic to this, but, umm… it's a way to think about the course of treatment and think about each session. Initial engagement, your primary tasks are first forming an alliance, right? Without an alliance nothing can happen. And an alliance means creating a sense of safety and security, okay. Developing an inter-subjective, umm… concordant inter-subjectivity, that, kind of, why we're meeting, right? What are we here for? Developing the affective, reflective dialogue that we talk about and think about what we talk about. That we talk about something and then we can reflect on it and think about it. We have an experience and we can then reflect on the experience, you know. A lot of times, quite often, you've probably seen in the tapes that I'm gonna show in the afternoon, I'll be saying things, you know, repeatedly like she, when you did that, when you said that, I was thinking and it's not that I'm right or wrong, I'm just sharing what I was thinking or what I was feeling for the other person to know. See, that made me think about it, okay. So we're creating a relationship there and creating a secure base, without a secure base, without that sense of safety, you can't do the exploration and, and then you can't have integration and then you can't have healing. Umm… some, initial intervention strategies, umm… creating a secure base through containment and PACE, okay, creating safety, your consistency, reliability and constancy, okay. It's not that you're predictable, but the certain things that can count on, okay, when they come to see you, okay. Uh, routines and rituals in session, okay. Certain things that you kind of always do that the child can count on. For example, when I'm meeting with the parents and the child is maybe sitting in my office, when I'm meeting with the parents somewhere else in another office, you know, with most kids, they come in, they sit down, I say, would you like a book or would you like some Lego? Depending on the child, okay? But they can always count on that. I'll ask, if they have been reading a book, umm… I always put a bookmark in it so when they come back, you know, or do you want to finish reading that book you were looking at. Oh, you do? Here is the book and, you know, here is the book mark where you left off, okay? So they can count on certain things. Establishing the intersubjective affective reflective dialogue, you have to work very hard at that, really be focused on that. And managing emotional closeness and distance, okay? It's important. Okay, you have to create and maintain a connection, umm… but it can't be too distant, otherwise, nothing is gonna to happen and you have to, sort of, titrate and regulate the degree of intimacy, so that it isn't overwhelming, but also it needs to be present. Uh , maintaining the working alliance, so at this point you have a working alliance, that you've begun, now you have to build it, strengthen it, okay. Your primary tasks here become managing affect regulation, okay. You do that through the relationship, through the reflective function, you know, you're talking about something and you see the child beginning to, umm… you know, fidget, look at their fingernails, right? You say, oh, umm… I notice, you know, you're like, paying, like attention to your finger nails right now. Is this okay or, or, or should we go into something else? Should we take a break? Okay. If you said to the child at that point probably, so, so what are you feeling right now? What's the answer you're probably gonna get? I don't know, right. And it's probably true, they don't know, so you have to put words, you have to help them, right? Going back to when you had an infant, right? Did you go into your infant they were crying and say, so what's going on, I'll pick you up as soon as you stop, no. What did you do, you pick your baby up and what, you… through your relationship, you dyadically calm the baby down. You did for them because they can't do it for themselves, okay. So through the relationship you regulate the parents and the child's degree of arousal. Uh, maintain intersubjective safety and you're beginning to do some exploration and those are your primary intervention, so are you sitting at home, parents are using primarily using attachment based, attachment facilitating parenting approaches. Umm… maintaining the working alliance, okay. Your primary tasks, repetition of the attachment sequence, relaxed, playful engagement and closeness. There is an evident flow, okay? Since your focus is on maintaining the relationship, that's your goal. The how you do is gonna depend on you, again if you are an art therapist, you'll use media. I do a lot of story telling, umm… I like magic, I do a lot of magic tricks, parents like those, kids like those, umm… most of the things I do, actually things I did, umm… and do with my own kids. So it's congruent, okay. So the things that you do the way you maintain the relationship need to be things that are congruent for you, because you're using yourself. Umm… exploration of shame events and trauma, okay. Always within the therapeutic window. If there is no affect present, if you're too low, nothing important is happening, but you don't want the person dysregulated, that's why it's called the therapeutic window, you have to stay right within there and the tricky part of it, the art of it is that that window is changing up and down over time depending on the mood and what's going on and the how big or wide it is as it changes overtime. Umm… okay, these are all your, your primary tasks here, okay. And interactive repair, umm… very important for parents, for us to help parents and for us to do to repair breaches in the relationship. To acknowledge the breach, right, like I did with Andrew, acknowledge my peace and then repair to relationship, fix it. You had a question? Okay. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Can I ask a little question? 

00:36:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What's that? 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Can I ask you a little question? Okay, how… Did they might not have that thing I think sometimes when I totally gives you when you say, you can get back and train yourself. How do you not manage with that, you're saying when you're probably get away with something that maybe you should get in coordinate with them, you know, what they have done, that you have following up that (inaudible ) people are helping to get there? 

00:37:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Did you all hear the question? Okay, it's a very good question. That's where thinking about where you are in the stage of treatment matters. Because early in treatment, you know, if the child seems to be becoming uncomfortable, fidgeting (inaudible ) you know, if you go onto something else and you say yes, I want it, okay, we can do that, why? Because I want them to have the experience that I will value them, honor what they're feeling and I'm not gonna to be pushing them, I will lead them, I'm not gonna push them. Okay, the analogy that comes to mind is, umm… if you want me to jump off the diving board and learn how to dive, I don't dive, it just doesn't make sense to me jump into something head first, but it's my own issues, if anyone here is a therapist and wants to consult with me. Umm… so, if you're gonna get me to jump off the diving board, umm… you're not gonna to do that if you're behind me and say come on, come on, go, go and start pushing me off the diving board, right? You're gonna get me to do that, say hey, why don't you walk up the ladder and see what you think. You know, why don't you walk along the diving board, just, you know, go, go along and then come on back when you're done, right? That's what we work. Now later in treatment, when you have more of a relationship and the family, the child, the parent whoever you're working with has more of a sense that you're doing things, your motivation is because you want to help, then sometimes just saying, gee, it looks like you're getting uncomfortable, umm… you know, I see you're looking at the windows, should we take a break, often they'll say, yeah, I don't like hearing about this, but you know, you we can talk about it some more, okay, you'll tell me when you're, kind of, having it. Yeah, I'll let you know because now they've reflected on your experience, they recognized you're uncomfortable, but now they can mange it. So and part of it depends where you are in treatment, how you would respond to that and how much you would want to, you know, how much you'd want to keep leading, even though they might be a little uncomfortable. Did that kind of answer your question. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. Right, you're, you're listening to them and responding, you know them for grant. That's what we have we can have that in your mind. 

00:39:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. And again, what's my focus? Early in treatment, my focus is on the relationship, I want to keep a relationship. So I can keep the relationship by talking about the trauma they experienced and how they were beaten and molested in their birth home. I can keep a relationship by doing a magic trick, by playing a game, by talking about their soccer game. What I want to maintain early in treatment is a emotionally meaningful relationship. I want to maintain all three elements of a concordant intersubjective experience. And I can do that by doing a lot of different things, okay. Great, okay. Umm… working through middle, uh, primary tasks here are uncovering the past and the present, Bolby(ph) talked about the internal working model, right? If your past is similar to your present and it doesn't cause problems there is nothing wrong with the past being active in the present, right? It only becomes a problem if your past is very different than the present and you don't recognize that and you're acting as if it's the same, right? So if you're acting in your family as if and using all the skills and expertise and confidence that you developed after five or six years in a orphanage, that's probably gonna create difficulties because how we live in a family is different than how we live in an orphanage, okay. So uncovering the past in the present, the exploration of working models, again co-regulation of affect, very important, development of the reflective function, the ability to think about your experience, the experience of someone else and talk about, a great example, umm… I was talking with a boy, 14, and he was describing how his birth mother had hurt him. And then he started talking about how she hurt his sister and, umm… his brothers and then paused for a minute, and said, now, Dr. Arthur, I want you to know, I'm not changing the subject, I just want you to know what she did. Now that's a beautiful example of the reflective function, because for him to do that, he had to… as he is talking recognized, I'm talking about my birth mom, now I'm talking about my siblings and how they got hurt, I'm doing it, because I want, you know, this guy to understand what it was like there, but you know what, he might be thinking, right, my motives, he might be thinking, I'm changing the subject, I like him to know I'm not, okay, that's so it's very simple, but it's a nice, I think, clear example of what the reflective function looks like in a simple dialogue. Finding meaning and behavior, all behavior has meaning, okay, often what makes traumatic event, you know, often what makes trauma traumatic is the meaning we ascribe to the event as opposed to the objective facts of the event. So the narrative that we create, the meaning we ascribe to the behavior, makes a big difference in how we experience it. And beginning, exploration beyond and through the secure base. Umm… some intervention strategies, review of history events and trauma often with kids and families at this point will read if we have them records, protective service reports, police reports, umm… a lot of… and it's not the reading that's important, like, it's not like I sit there and read the 10 page report and great, now we've done that, we're done, perhaps sometimes what families find a little irritating, I might read a sentence and then we'll talk about she, when you hear that, you know, what, sort of, feelings do you have, what's that like hearing about this, okay? It's the, it's, it's reading the material to begin to deepen the experience, deepen the memories, evoke affect within the therapeutic window, to redo the experience, if you will. Okay, so when the child was 5, right, they had certain cognitive and emotional abilities. Now they're 12, they certainly have different cognitive emotional abilities, in addition, when they were five and being molested or abused they were alone. And the person who they relied on to take care of them was doing this. Now, there are with people hopefully, with people who care about them, who love them, who want to protect them. So the revisiting the experience through the reports, is a way to rework some of this material and integrate it, okay. Uh, Dan talked about talking for, talking about different ways of talking with children, I find that especially a lot with teenagers, sometimes just talking about them with the parents, umm… allows them to listen without necessarily being quite as involved as they , umm… might otherwise have to be and allows them to listen and then think about things. And of course, they can chime in, you know, they might say, well that was a stupid idea, uh… okay, well that's wrong, you know, what do you think? Okay. So again, kind of, be away also to engage them, because when I'm sharing ideas I don't necessarily think I'm right so if the kids says that's a dumb idea, I'm interested, well, okay, well, then, what do you, what do you think is another idea? You know, it's just a thought. You know better than me. Could you help me with this? Role-playing, psychodramatic reenactments, you'll see, I'm gonna show you a role-play in the afternoon. So we will see what that looks like. Reciprocal affective reflective dialogue about the therapeu… about the therapeutic relationships. So at this stage, we can talk about our relationship with each other, in more depth and detail, okay. Our experience with each other, addressing with PACE, defenses and symptoms and increasing responsibility and freedom at home-based on demonstrated secure attachment behaviors, okay. Role-playing, umm… again you see that, umm… often we will role-play significant events that have occurred, events from the reports, umm… using language and props from that material can be very helpful, okay. Remember, one role-play we did with a boy and, umm… also at the end of every role-play, just say we do a role-play and then afterwards we talk about it, that's, sort of, and it's a drawn out version of affective-reflective dialogue. We're having and experience, the role-play and then we reflect on it afterwards, okay. Anyway we're talking and I was, sort of, thinking in my mind, well, this was a buzz because the boy who sat there, he was laughing a whole bunch through it and it didn't seem to me that much was happening, but anyway we'll talk about afterwards later in the session. He said, oh, boy that was really rough, you know. He said, oh, you know, I thought, maybe it was making you really uncomfortable because you're laughing and, and maybe not much was happening, I don't know, he said, oh, no, I was laughing it was really, really uncomfortable, all I could think about was when, umm… my birth mom, now again language is interesting. He didn't say when, umm… your partner was being my birth mom, what he said when my birth mom was sitting there, holding the Budweiser can, all I could look at and think about was, you know, her drinking the Budweiser, because we read in a police report, you know, something about you know, officer John showed up, there were beer cans scattered around the living room and the officer happen to name the brands. So we had in the role-play the person holding the actual brand and that's somehow made the event much more real frame. Umm… Uh, uh, good question… Well, nobody asked it, but one question I sometimes get asked is how do you know when to do a role-play? Because again, you want to keep the person within that therapeutic window. So what I do the way I gauge that is first, we'll talk about different experiences and if they can talk about it within a session, that's good. Then I, well, sometimes say if you met whoever, grandfather, birth mother, birth father, what would you want to ask them or say to them, like sometimes children, you know, have a whole bunch of things, sometimes you know, the answer is nothing. Oh, okay. Umm… would you be interested in, umm… I don't know would you be interested in why they didn't go to the… those drug classes they were supposed to go. Oh, yeah, I would be interested in it, okay. And then I might say, why don't you go home, umm… and maybe over the next week jot down some questions or things you should, questions you like to ask this person or things you would like to say and they might come back the next week, how did you, you know, did you do that? No, I was too busy, that's fine. But, eventually they will come in with a list of questions and they want to ask and statements, once your child with their parents can do that, okay. So we've talked about it, we've read some history, we've talked about it, once they can, sort of, prepare this list of things, then to my mind, now they're ready to do something more emotionally intensive which is the role-play or psychodramatic reenactment, so that's, kind of, how I titrate that, so that I… 'Cause I don't want to disregulate a child, I don't want to disregulate the parents, okay. So it's like how I can gauge that. Late stages integration, umm… here what we're looking at is development of a coherent autobiographical narrative with the integration of the trauma, not the disassociation splitting off, at this point we should see it being woven into the narrative in a coherent way. Uh, habitual use of attachment behaviors, right? Attachment in its simplest form is what, proximity seeking behavior, so looking for help, being able to access help when you need it, okay. And then the child… We're looking to see that in a more consistent manner. Development of a balanced view of self and others. Often children, for example, will come in to treatment and a lot of times I hear one of two things, either I hate my birth parents, they're awful, they're terrible or I love them, they're perfect, I don't know why I got taken away. Umm… and what I'm looking for, umm… because I think neither of you is completely accurate, is a more nuanced shades of great view, that in fact they probably did have some very positive good experiences with their birth family and they also had some pretty horrible frightening terrifying experiences, both. Okay. So can I have more integrated balanced field, can I recognize the parents today, love them, and care about them, but maybe sometimes lose their temper or have them do things that they'd rather not do. But again, do they understand the motivation, right? Do they see the motivation as intent as, as by and large positive or benign, right? Most of the time, right? Most of the time you can take your children to the pediatrician to get their vaccinations, right? Umm… and most of the time they'll go with you even though nobody likes getting shots, but because in someway your child understands even though it hurts it's to help them, right? You're not brining them there because you want to see them have pain inflicted on them, you're bringing them there because you believe it's good for them, and they understand that to some degree. I'm sorry. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:52:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, (inaudible ). A good story isn't the facts, a good storyteller tells a story with affect and words, right? Affect and… That's what makes a good storyteller. So that's what we're looking for here, affect and words, okay, that's what I mean, that was a good point. Thank you for asking that. Right, so we're looking for both. Yes. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:52:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ) parents there, because they create a secure base, and I want the child to feel that the parents are there on their side, understand what a difficult life they've had, how hard it's been, the horrible things that they've had to go through, plus they've experienced and to share that together, it's the shared experiences together, umm… that help make it therapeutic, it's the support that parents provide, umm… and for the child when they, when they first happened they were alone with these emotions which is why often they disassociate them because they're overwhelming. Now they're with people they can share the emotion with and it makes the burden… can make it lighter, so I want the parents there. I want them all together, okay. Umm… All right, umm… primary intervention strategies. Again, reflection on past and current functioning, we can talk about that, uh, reflection on the treatment experience, at this point in treatment what often comes up and what I often talk about with families is, umm… the parents and the child is. Remember, when we started, remember what things were right then. Boy, are they different now? That helpful for parents to reflect on the changes it helping for the child. So there is reflection on the treatment experience, you know, umm… often toward the ends of treatment, umm… I can not able to show to show this, but often can I got some clips, umm… we got a point where I'll, kind of, say, umm… you know, we could either leave things open, call me if you would like to schedule another appointment or umm… you know, if you want we can schedule something for down the road, whatever is best. Often toward the end of treatment, at that point, parents are, sort of, happy to say, you know, things are good, we can end, but I have a lot of kids, oh, no, let's come back in six weeks, could we come back in a month, okay, very different thing beginning of treatment where a lots of kids are, you know, why I am here, I don't want to be here, you an idiot, you are a moron, I don't want to talk to you, right? Very, very different and then I'll talk about that with the kids, you know, and we can, kind of, laugh about together. Okay. Reflection on the narrative, lot of reflection is occurring at this stage, reflection on emotions, the reflective function, relational skills, reflection on home life, on attachment behaviors, umm… oh, magic, what that refers to is you'll see this in the, the role-play clip I'm gonna show, usually, after I do a series of role-plays over several weeks or months, we end it with umm… one role-play, I call it, I just call it the magic wand, because it's a little kids have a magic wand, umm… and say, gee, if we could have your uncle, grandmother, be nice, healthy, whatever the words are that make sense to the family for five minutes, let's have them come back and so in that role-play that's a chance for the person who might have been, you know, borderline or what have you to say the things, all the things you wish that they could have said, which are basically what, I'm sorry about what I did, right, in essence it's my fault, not your fault, I apologize for that. Umm… another thing, you would, you know, be great if a birth parent could say is I would like you to be a part of this family, like you be their daughter and let them be, you know, your mom and dad, okay. And if you want to love me too that's fine too. So that's what we have happened in that portion. And again, it's so interesting and you will see this in the umm… role-play I'm gonna show, kids don't talk about it as, boy, that was really nice when you had, umm… your partner pretend to be my birth mom and she said those nice things, they say like at the end of the treatment when I'll ask kids for example what sessions stands out in your mind, they'll say, oh, when my birth mom said I could be a Johnson, that made all the difference in the world, okay. Not when someone pretended to be my birth mom, but the experience for them almost always is as if it actually happened, okay. Okay, I talked about that. Umm… I'm just gonna go briefly go through this, this is just a little slide that, sort of, captures, umm… what could be the flow of a set of interactions in a session, at the heart of what you're doing is PACE, being playful, accepting, curious, having empathy. I'll just walk through a very quick example, umm… we start by looking at some behavior, it could be anything. Again remember, I met with a parent or parents first, then we're all together, okay. So, umm… how many of you ever sat down with the family and say something like, you know, how did things go and the child says I was bad. Ever, ever hear that? Now again, interesting use of words, if you listen to it, none of my kids would ever say, I don't believe I was bad. Okay, my kids might say I did something bad, I got in trouble, I did something I shouldn't, but I don't think, I can't really remember ever hearing one of… you know, my own children say I was bad, okay. So I hear the little girl say, umm… that, again it's not my cue to jump in with the lecture, now, Mary, you know you're not bad, just sometimes you do bad things. Right, not the cue for that. What I do, what would you do, kind of, very abbreviated example, using acceptance and curiosity, is figure out what does mean for her. Oh, you, really, what happened? I start with something very simple, what happened? And, you know, she say, well, yesterday evening, uh, we were in the living room and I started hitting and kicking my birth, uh, my foster mom. Really? My goodness. Well, what was going on? So I want to hear more, I want to hear what was happening. Umm… well, I just was, I don't know, I just started hitting her and kicking. What, let's back up. Now again, because I've spoken with the, umm… foster mom ahead of time she is probably gonna be pretty comfortable listen, she is not gonna feel the need to jump in and correct Mary and tell her, no, that didn't happen, no, it didn't happen this, so she is kind of listening. And I might, you know, say, oh, what about that, what were you doing? We were eating dinner. Oh, were you angry then? No, everything was fine. Although, I thought mom was upset because I didn't finish my peas. Really? What made you think that? Well, when she came back in from the kitchen, she had that look on her face. You know the look that mom get when she… Oh, yeah, I know the look she gets, umm… she had that look, yes. I knew she was mad about the peas. Is that when you got mad? No. Oh, so now I'm, so what was good… so what happened, Mary? But we went in the living room and mom said, uh, we have to clean up the living room and we started cleaning up the living room and umm…you know the doll I have, the one that my birth mom gave me, oh yeah, I know, that you've showed me that, that's the only thing you have from her, right. Yeah, she picked it up, she put it in the bookcase. Yeah, well, she was mad at me, she was punishing me, she took my doll away, she can't do that, that's my doll and so I started hitting her and kicking her and biting, I was really mad, because she can't take my… Okay, so now, now I understand what was going on for Mary. Because probably in the earlier session with the foster mom she probably came in with something like I have no idea what happened, we had dinner, she was quiet during dinner, we were cleaning up the living room, the next thing I know, she is kicking me, she is biting me, I have no idea what's going on, because I don't know if I can keep her in my home, I can't have a kid like that. But now, oh, okay, and now, now I can really normalize it, I have empathy, 'cause it make sense to me now, right, because if someone took my most prized possession, I'd be pretty upset too, I'd be angry, I might not hit or kick but I'd be angry, I'd be upset. And now the two of them can talk about that. And develop a new meaning, you know, I might say, mom, did you know? No, I had no idea, but what, how come you picked up the doll? Well, I picked it up because, we're, right we're cleaning up the living, it was wreck, I thought one of us would step on and break it, so I just wanted to put it out of the way to keep it safe. Did you know that, Mary? And Mary is looking at her mom, no, you know and she is, 'cause she had thought her mom was being mean and punitive, right, and nasty. Now the internal working model has been evoked, they can talk about it and now they can develop meaning, this isn't the randomly aggressive kid. Mom has her reasons for doing things. And then later, at some other point they can address the behavior that wasn't okay. But the feelings are certainly understandable, so just very quickly, that's one way to think about this. Umm… Okay, umm… now I just want to talk very briefly this approach to treatment, Dyadic developmental psychotherapy umm… is an evidenced based (inaudible[01:02.56]) support for this treatment. I just want to give you a quick umm… look at a couple of things that show that, if you are really interested in the studies, if you email me, I've got reprints in PDF format and I can email them back to you, if you are interesting. I've got cards up here and on the table back there, there are some brochures and they've got my umm… email address as well. But one study that umm… we did, comparing two groups, treatment group that DDP and then a control group, these were kids who got other forms of treatment by other providers and this occurred about four years after treatment ended, okay? Umm… first what we found was that in the treatment group, about umm… little bit less than half, 42% after treatment ended, got additional treatment, about 25 sessions over those four years. Umm… all of that just as an FYI, all of that umm… was umm… medication management sessions, you know, for they were seeing the psychiatrist for umm… different medications. 100% of the children in the control group continued in treatment, even after it ended with other providers, even after it ended, umm… averaging about 50 sessions, so twice as many sessions, okay? And umm… what we found was, for the treatment group, umm… there are actually two studies but umm… within the two years after the treatment ended, what we see is that you are familiar with the child behavior checklist, the Achenbach? Okay, so anyway, that's what we used. As you can see, all of the pretreatment scores were in the clinical range and four years later, four years after treatment ended, all the scores were in the, what they call the normal range, and umm… all of them statistically significantly lower. So at least for four years after it, we know that… four years after treatment, children will have complex trauma and reactive attachment disorder, who have been treated with DDP four years after treatment, still show good results, okay? For those in the control group who again, remember, they received other treatment from other providers. Individual therapy, play therapy, umm… CBT, a whole of range of residential treatment, a whole range of things. What we, umm… how would I know what a monkey feels like, I don't know how to get around with that tail. Umm… what we see is all of their pretest scores are in the clinical range, just like the treatment group, okay. So they are really no different than the treatment group but what we see is two years later, their score stayed in the clinical range, okay? No change. Even though they had treatment and then continued on afterwards to get other treatment still, okay? And what we actually found what…this is the disturbing part for me, is actually, on some of the scales, like anxious, depressed, attention problems, rule breaking behavior and aggressive behavior, their scores got statistically significantly worse, okay? So not only does DDP produce good results that at least sustain themselves, for at least four years, but children who other forms of treatment, umm… even though they were getting treatment, got worse in some regards. Okay, umm… oh good. I went through that pretty quickly. We've got time before we go on to the umm… certification process. Questions about anything I've covered so far? Questions? Yes. 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) is that just a perception? 

01:07:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ) for two hours. First I meet with the parent, well, let me back up. The first several sessions are usually just with the parents, because I want to get to know them. I want them to understand the treatment. I want to build a relationship with them. I also want to help them feel a sense of safety and security. I want to feel comfortable that we can, you know, begin to do the work again and of course, if they have things in their past that maybe interfering with their being the kind of parent they'd like to be, I'd like to maybe have a chance to talk about some of those things. Then when we all start working together, then every session I first meet with the parents for a little bit, then everybody together, and then with the parents at the end for a little bit. So that's why I do, I wouldn't have to our sessions, so I've got enough time to do all of that at a reasonably leisurely pace and not have anybody be rushed, okay? Yes. 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:08:17
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible[01:08.19]). 

01:08:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible[01:08.21]). 

01:08:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, I see. 

01:08:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible[01:08.46]). 

01:08:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Umm, well, to answer it this way, I, as part of my evaluation. I am assessing the parents' capacity, their sense of commitment, maybe the own state of mind with respect to, umm… you know, attachment, umm… their own history and all of that. I am assessing all of that but never turning anybody away, it just may mean, I want to work with them longer as a couple or individually before we do some of the family works. I want the parents to be in a good place to be the sort of parents they want to be, to be successful and to be helpful, so I would never umm… turn somebody away. umm… I sometimes will get parents who will say, "When are we gonna bring, you know, my kid in here." And I may say, you know, "We are gonna do that real soon, umm… but we've talked about it. Every time the child does this, you do that, and you are not happy about it. Then I think it would be useful if you could really get a handle on that, so that when the child does that, you don't do this anymore and then you'll feel better about yourself." So I work with, really anyone who comes in, I wouldn't turn them away umm… I just work with different families in different ways but the key is, what's really key is, you have to find a way to, umm… more than accept them, to feel something about them that you can like and enjoy, that you can really feel. Oh, good, you know, the Johnsons(ph) are gonna be here in 20 minutes, umm… you know, I'm looking forward to Mrs. Joan(ph), we have some things we want to talk about. To have that sense, that's important because if you can create that kind of relationship, that will be therapeutic and that will be healing and then all the things you'd like to have happened with the kid and the family will eventually occur. Where's your question? I mean, her? 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) What ages do you work with? (inaudible ). 

01:10:48
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ) infants all the way up to umm… I had parents in their 70s, so, yeah, any age. Again, different, different umm… It might look a little different with different kinds of configurations, but the basic approach is the same. So if I work with family that has an infant, I'm gonna be doing a lot of work, almost all with the parents and they can bring the infant, obviously and we can do some things there, but it's the same basic approach. Creating a sense of safety and security, right? Creating through the creation of concordant inter-subjective experiences, building a relationship, addressing the past as it's reflected in the present, integrating that and then still integration that you have healing, okay? So your question and then yours, okay. 

01:11:45
UNKNOWN Umm… I was gonna ask how much effort would be placed in these situations where you are working with parents and (inaudible ) umm… if you see that this parent has such severe trauma and (inaudible ) they are simply not even aware, they are not able to give that child any (inaudible) anything. Umm… It's the situation that is I'm, I'm really afraid (inaudible) but how much should I (inaudible) first of all, she is not in there because… and how much should I just try to help her be present with her child? 

01:12:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Past is interfering with the present then you have to address that. If it's not, then you don't. So if it is, then you do and that needs to… 

01:12:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:12:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, yeah. And then you may want to coordinate with that therapist to see what they are doing, umm… find out, you know, does she continue just with you? Does she continue with both? Does she end with you? I mean, there're a lot of different iterations you can go through, but I would talk with that therapist about what's going on and what seems to be the best approach to get this parent-child to be where you'd like them to be. Got a question? 

01:13:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:13:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ). 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:13:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, again (inaudible ) those people umm… around what they've done. In some ways, umm… I find, in some ways it can make things, well, it's complicated, we can also make simpler because then you got the actual people who can apologize for what they've done and try to remedy that and try to work on their own attachment history and let the child know that, you know, it wasn't you, it was me, and that's very powerful. So that part becomes a little simpler. It's more complex because people obviously who are in that situation, have significant difficulties in their own past that have interfered with their ability to be the kind of parent they want to be. I don't believe anybody wants to abuse or neglect their kid. Umm… You know, I work, I don't know if you do it where you work, in New York umm… One of the things I often always require birth parents do, if they've been abusive or neglectful is take a parenting class, okay? And I don't know why they do that 'cause I frankly have never ever had a parent come in and say, "Thank God, they sent me that class. I had no idea you are not supposed to hit your kid. Great!" Okay, so umm… it's about emotions, not about… They know, okay. So umm… yeah it doesn't change the approach in anyway. Might change, might spend more time with the birth family. You might move at a different pace because you don't want to open up, you know, talk to trust exercise it, you don't want to fall back, you don't want the child to fall back unless you are convinced there's going to be somebody there to safely catch the child. That, kind of, answer your question? 

01:15:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible )stat little thing you say and extra you know, how bad she can be. Probably that she can choose, probably wasn't she cause to. 

01:15:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN We all have that sickness, you know, Well, what I would say, we certainly we all have histories but I'd also say is that we have a child that you have not raised from birth that brings their own history in, that I say this is not a clinical term but sometimes I think of some of these children as being relationship phobic and what I mean by that is that they've been so hurt so many times, that they are afraid of relationships and hey, for good reason, given all the stuff they've been through, right? They would… they would really be stupid to say, "Oh, you were saying you are different. Great. No problem." Right? I mean, that would be a good example of mental illness. Okay. So if they, you know, so I think of them of as relationship phobic. So what does that mean? That means that there is a degree of intimacy that they are comfortable with. Why? Because they just feel better that way. So what happens? They come into a family and they do a variety of things and all of a sudden, they do something that creates a degree of intimacy that they are comfortable with. So they keep doing it, like, I remember seeing a mom and she adopted twins and she was describing the two kids' behavior, they are each eight. So first time, she'd ever adopted a girl, she'd raised teenage boys and done it very well with that. You know, as she was describing the behavior, and what bothered her about each of the kids, and I remember saying to her, "What's, you know, what's the thing that most bothers you, or irritates you about what your daughter does?" And she said, "Oh, Umm… I've told her a million times when you yawn, cover your mouth. It really annoys me and I get really angry when she stands and goes, you know. I can't stand it." And I said, "That's really interesting. And that gets you mad and that bothers you more than like you described how last week your son broke your cocktail table in a temper tantrum." You know, and she said, "Yeah, and actually now that you've mentioned it, I guess that is a little odd but yeah, I guess that I just see as very direct and that doesn't bother me but this is so…" Anyway, we then use that as the segue to talk about how she was raised, her relationship with her mother, what that family was like, what she taught her about man and all that sort of stuff. And once we did that, you know, she was able to umm… be with her daughter, so that that behavior wasn't a barrier to their creating a degree of intimacy that would be therapeutic and healing. Does that, kind of, answer your question? Okay, good. Let me just see. Let me answer hers and then yours, okay? Uh, go ahead, you are… 

01:18:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) talking about sexual trauma and how that has an impact (inaudible ). 

01:18:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Until a secure and healthy attachment, the ability to do that separately, I don't think is useful. I think first you… now once you've created that and as evident, that maybe appropriate at some point but again, first things first. First, they have to have a relationship with their primary caregivers, that's trusting and secure and comfortable before they can, kind of, move on beyond that, so that's really what I want to be focusing on first. So yeah, at the some point once that's created for them to… Because then they're… then they are dealing with different issues at a very different level, okay? Umm… there you're needing to focus on the attachment piece because that's been resolved to some extent. You had a question and then I'll take yours. 

01:19:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:19:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ). 

01:19:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:19:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh. Good question. 

01:19:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:20:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Umm… That's why I'd mentioned earlier I will… I think we are nearly, you know, ready to (inaudible ) they'll say, "Do you want to leave it open and do reschedule on another appointment?" If the family finds it helpful, the child or the parent could come in if they… It's their family and so if they are finding it helpful to come in every month, every six weeks, whatever to talk about issues then I'm happy to meet with them because its their… 

01:20:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:20:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, well, that's what I mean. There are families sometimes I've…I'm kind of feeling, you know, we've done a good piece of work. We can end. I don't know why we would do anything else. I don't know… 

01:20:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:20:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I may but they must keep… be getting something out of it, so there is progress from their point of view. I may not think that and maybe that's my, you know, oversight or my lack of seeing something but they are getting something out of this that's meaningful to them and it's their family. Umm…I might talk with them and say, "Could you help me understand why it is you keep wanting to come back every six weeks, you know. You know, I like you, I like meeting with you. Umm… It seems to me I don't see much change," you know. They often would have a reason why they find it helpful. It's their family. If they find it helpful, I'll keep working with them. 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:21:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN 'Cause that's my… If they are finding it helpful. 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:21:31
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

01:21:31
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:21:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, I think it's more of the…than the parenting field is the treatment helpful. If you are not finding it helpful then you are not going to schedule another section and you'd find somebody else, so from that point of view, if they scheduling, if they're finding it helpful. If they are not finding it helpful, right? What I often say to parents is, umm… You know after we've done an assessment within, really within about 90 days, we should know if we're on the right track. Not that everything is going to be better or different, but you'll at least have a sense after three months that we're, kind of, moving in the right direction. So if you don't feel that, then probably, well whatever I say is then probably if we are not moving in a good direction that probably represents the fact that my assessment missed something. Because if I have a good assessment and have a good understanding of the family and I'm using interventions in an approach that is congruent with that assessment we should see something happening. If something isn't happening, it's probably because I missed something in the assessment, that's my thinking. 

01:22:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:22:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Why would you talk about it with it? I mean, that's… it's important to have an open dialogue and I would suggest that's a very good… 

01:23:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:23:01
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, no real timeframe, but again that's why I leave with the parents and then everybody in the… Because that first, you know, bit of time with just the parents gives the parent good chance to bring up whatever happens to be on their mind which could be, you know, even meeting for six months. "Nothing's happening, what are we doing here?" And we can, kind of, talk about that. Yes. 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN Umm… I just keep pattern because something that can probably achieve it, usually because I see it very quickly then they completely collapse, I mean, they ladder and then they been collapsed when they be better on something better they took is that usually going to see that period of when it punches from, when they take that. is that something that just more I am not really not can increase in the (inaudible )or something that parents can let go without taking care of, what the problem was… 

01:23:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, probably common in, I often describe to parents that, um…well, that's how I think about umm… it is that… most of the things we are used to like, for a learning a new skill, umm…you know, usually goes something like that, okay? My experience often in this work, not always but often in this work is that things, kind of, tend to go umm… like this. 

01:24:35
[sil.] 

01:24:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Umm… the thing seeming to work occur more frequently and last longer and the difficult period gets shorter and umm… shorter and I think that's a combination of both, you know, sometimes parents slipping back, doing things that they are used to and children, you know, things happen at the trigger past trauma. Trauma is never erased. We all have a weak point. Some people get headaches, some people get stomachaches, some people get irritable and so for children with trauma, they have certain things that may become evident in certain stressful times or at certain developmental stages. 

01:25:25
UNKNOWN when you have (inaudible ). 

01:26:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ) go into a session with a daughter until we've done more work with the parents so that they feel umm…that sense of safe secure base with me, with us and we've done some work so that they are able, when their daughter falls back, to catch her. So yeah, often that can be a really long process if someone has some significant mental illness or trauma in their background but the parent has to, whoever is caring for the child, has to be able to create the kind of relationship that we would like. And if they can't, then we have our job, my… I see my job is to work with them to help them be there because that's what they want. They want to be a good parent. So I may take a long time but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna rush it. 

01:26:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:27:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You can't make something happen that isn't there. 

01:27:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:27:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ) like we both, Dan and I've said very clearly, "Safety first." Once that separate place for their psychological safety or emotional safety, then you can do the others, so assuming you've managed the safety issues and that's been addressed then do you need to work with the parent, umm… because they have to be the one. Not that you can involve the child, but you have to just be careful to not put demands on the relationship that the parent is not able to meet because you don't want them to be not successful and you know, you work with what you have. And again, sometimes you look at, at home placements, residential placements, but safety is really the primary first issue. If there isn't physical and psychological safety, you can't do anything else, you just can't. Umm… okay. 

01:28:15
UNKNOWN Uh, guys, you guys have been giving Arthur a hard time and I feel a little jealous that I think I got all the easy questions and he got a little hard ones. Uh, also I think, I think you're after an agreement and I would agree how Arthur is a little more stubborn than I am but, uh, sometimes I do individual therapy with the kids. I just have to admit it, I am not ashamed of it. Yeah, sometimes I can't work with the parents and so then I do individual therapy with the kids. And I would refer the parents to someone else, or I would see the parents and someone else would do individual therapy with the kids. That's not my… happy… I'm not happy with that. That's not my default position, the fault is family work, If the kids have healthy parents, darn it, I'm gonna nag them and get the parents in. So if I had a teenager who wanted to do individual work, I'd say, "Yeah, let's do it." The only reason that they'll come into my office is individually, I'll do it but if they have really good parents, they need to know what they are missing, that they may have some, sort of, sense that "My parents can hear this," but if they have good parents, they are gonna be a lot healthier if they can tell their parents regardless of their age, bring them into it. Umm…and this model works great individually. It's even better in some ways, in traditional model 'cause they don't have attachment figure. If the kids at behavior residential facility that some believe in attachment, I'm gonna do individual work for that kid, and not bring the child care workers in 'cause they won't be committed though. They will quit in two days and whatever. And then they need an attachment figure, inter-subjectivity is way to go, so… I said enough, yes. We need to talk, like we only have five minutes to talk about certification, we really… Can I just say one sentence and Arthur will finish that? Is it okay? 

01:29:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Say as much as you like. You say good things. 

01:29:55
UNKNOWN Oh, thanks, Arthur. 

01:29:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You're welcome. 

01:29:55
UNKNOWN All right. 

01:30:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You were expecting that, weren't you? 

01:30:00
UNKNOWN Oh, no. I wasn't. Anyway, when I wrote my first book in 1997, and then I realized that people want me to… get train them and I never thought I just have to do just start training people. Damn it. So I started training people in this model and I've been this since about 1999, so I have training programs and then Art does some now as well, so we train people using this model and that was fine. I don't like (inaudible ) on but all of the sudden I realized some people got the original training and never got a supervision and are doing things that I really don't like. And they got the training but they are doing weird things that had nothing to do with this model. So I thought and I've been referring people to them because I got the initial training, so I thought I can't do that anymore, I have to start certifying people. Partly, Art's been nagging me for long, about getting it going, so with Art and I together, we are taking the lead and now we have ten board members, in terms of doing a certification process and to be certified, you got to get supervision and this model by people who are using the model the way we believe is crucial, is the core of the model. The highlights of what you are hearing today, uh, you use it, you try dealing at some point, I mean, you'll be watching us this afternoon on how we use the model. At certain point, you hit a plateau and to get further, you have to have people watch you do the model. And that's what the certification is all about and then it can be certified as a practitioner. And after that, if you want to go further, you can be certified as a consultant to what… what sort of other people's tapes and after that, we are developing a training, there won't be a trainer in this model but anyway, so that's what we now have and Art will give you the… It's all on our website too, Art will give you the highlight of that. 

01:31:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Great. Thanks. Yeah, there's a brochure back there and you can go to the website for The Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy Institute but basically for the certification process, you need umm…education, so you need to be a umm… mental health professional, you need to be licensed or certified to be able to umm… basically you need meet the legal requirements to practice in the jurisdiction you are practicing it, okay? An insurance and then, uh, it is 56 training hours. 56 hours of training in DDP by a certified Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy umm… Institute certified trainer, okay? And again on the website you can find out where some of that is. Once you have all of that, and umm…you then can make the application for the certification process. You submit umm… two DVDs and the website describes all of that in detail and application fee. Then you start what we call the practicum. And at that point, you pick a consultant, you send them a DVD, they review it, they'll give you written feedback. After you do that, umm…five times, your fifth DVD and your first one then go to a second consultant that you picked. They review it if your primary consultant and the second one agree, then you can do your next five DVDs and after you've done ten, the tenth one gets reviewed again by two people. Then at that point, you get certified and the certification is for three years umm… and to the… I think if I remember right, to be recertified, you need to have at least two tapes reviewed by a consultant during the three year period or you take a certain number of training hours. And the idea is that this model umm…continues to develop and we just want to make sure that people umm… develop with the model, so that's the basic, umm… the basic process for application. Once you're certified, umm… you may get a certificate and then you say that you are a practitioner of Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, okay? Umm… for people who have taken training umm… before or have completed the hours before 2004, there is a grand parenting process and again, that's up on the website. And, yeah, I talked about the continuing it and recertification process. Yeah. Umm… any questions about that? No? If not… 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:34:33
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, on the website we list… Anyone who is a certified Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy therapist is listed, all the certified consultants are listed and the certified trainers are listed. So it's all on the website. 

01:34:40
