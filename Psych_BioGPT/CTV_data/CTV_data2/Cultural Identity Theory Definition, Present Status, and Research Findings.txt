00:00:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Okay. I, I hate podiums but we're kinda stuck with this, okay. So, uhm, and, I, I don't even think I could replicate Joe White (laughs)... (crosstalk) 

00:00:25
 Uh hmm, (inaudible ). 

00:00:29
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  but, but there is a little preacher in me but I, I'm gonna be contained today, so, (crosstalk) 

00:00:30
 (laughing). 

00:00:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Okay. What I wanted to do today, ah, was a slightly different from the title than your, um, um, brochure is to really give you an update on Nigrescence Theory, uhm, and to try to leave at least fifteen minutes time for question and answer. I think that's where this is, is fun. Ah, I'm gonna show you a few tables, nothing like we had in the last, ah, scenario. It will be primarily, ah, correlational tables. Ah, I think I forgot to put the ins and the ins or robust so don't, I mean, worry about that and eventually, you'll be able to see all this in print. I think today I'm more concerned with painting pictures with you and letting you know how things have progressed, okay? It takes a village to make it fairest and I, I certainly have had my village, and I certainly have left some names out, uhm, Joe White's work which I read as uhm, ah, a graduate student of Princeton even though I didn't know him for years, it was certainly critical. Ah, Janet and I have not interacted as much as perhaps you would like, but clearly, there was a point in my career where she and Tom Parham(ph), literally caused, ah, me to be still be on the drawing board as a result of their work. Uhm, but more recently, uhm, my career has found a way to stay alive and that's been because of some of these people I've mentioned and, and, ah, with the special highlighting of Penney(ph) Fagan-Smith. Penney(ph), are you here? I'll embarrass a few people, Frank Laurel(ph), Beverly Vandever(ph), ah, thank you. And, ah, I appreciate the work that they've done. Essentially, I have, I've watched some of my colleagues of my age, ah, look dead at 60, walk down the halls as if they're dead. And I swear to you, sometimes I get up and have to be reminded that I'm almost 64 because these people of, not so much young as in a physical sense but as, as in the mental sense. And I, I really appreciate that because when you get older, you don't have much more than your job (laughs) and so it's nice to... (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
 (laughing). 

00:02:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Have something. 

00:02:40
  (laughing). 

00:02:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  The 1971 version of Nigrescence, ah, in fact, we didn't call that. Uhm, I just realize I still have a typing error on the, on the first words. It should be pre-encounter not re-encounter. Uhm. 

00:03:00
 (laughing). 

00:03:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  It starts, uh, the context of the, uhm, amazing Black Social Movement of the 1970s. Ah, but as it turns out, uhm, if you take the time as I have done in some of my writing and you look at the Black experience across time and space, you'll see that Nigrescence is a recurring theme in African American history. We can find during, ah, and in a sense, it's a recurring theme in part because as a people, we have not achieved liberation. Ah, and I don't mean by that necessarily, ah, the most radical version of liberation but using a more modest definition, ah, ah, the, the chance to become neurotic like most other White American middle-class people that, that's what we had not had a chance to do. Okay. (laughs) 

00:03:45
 (laughing). 

00:03:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  We, we are not, we are not distributed across the socio-economic scale, ah, and we don't have enough power and so on based on our numbers and based on, on a long, the, the length of time that we've been here. I have no illusions if, if that had, had occurred. We'd probably have another conference maybe by Native Americans in which they would be complaining of the extent to which African Americans are not helping them because there is a tendency that as groups, to achieve success in, in the American society, they take on ironically more pre-encounter perspectives and they begin to have an attitude toward those who are beneath them. We certainly have not been afforded that attitude as yet (cough) although we are seeing in the 1980s and 1990s, a critical mass of our people who have, ah, sincerely, I, I don't trust their, I don't, I don't question their sincerity but who have sincerely become ight wing and we see the disasters that are occurring before that. So I have no illusions but that doesn't mean we, we shouldn't struggle and shouldn't resist and hopefully resist to a higher level. But in 1971, ah, in, in the 1970s, this was the first time in African American history in which psychologist tried to codify the recurring theme of Nigrescence. Ah, you'd have to go back to 1929 and read Alaine Locke's, uhm, uhm, wonderful essay called The New Negro, ah, to get a sense of, of what we, we began to talk about in 1971. I think that frankly can be explained by the fact that there was not a critical mass of Black psychologist. Ah, and when we codified the Holo-Renaissance(ph) and when we codified the Garvey Movement, if you read that material closely, you can see the stages that are there, ah, but no one sat down, wrote about it, gave it a label and so on. So again, no illusions here. Ah, it just so happened that Janet Helms, myself, and some other people, we were fortunate enough in our training to see the link between psychotherapy, religious conversion and so on in the experiences that Black people were living on the streets in the 1970's. And we codified those into stages. Why stages? I think because again, our training. Remember in therapy, we used to talk about the fact that a client would come into the office, people don't know this but I was first trained in clinical site. Ah, we would, a client would come into the office and they would present the problem, right? Okay. And we will often say something about, "Okay. Early stages." (laughs) And then we would wait for something that, something good to happen, not good necessarily that the person would be upset, but something to agitate the person so they would find and go deep. They would have an encounter in therapy and they would go deep. And then they would have what? A real contact with their, their, their issues and then we go through like an immersion-emersion stage in which they would try to have a struggle between their old perceptions, their old feelings versus where they wanna go, okay. And it was quite tumultuous because they knew where they wanted go but they could, they weren't there yet and they, they were still more of the old person that, that they wanted to get rid of. And then finally, ah, we, we had, ah, something called, ah, ah, habituation of the new insights and we simply call that internalization. And then if we were lucky enough to have that person live the therapy on a long-term basis, we call that commitment. And so that comes right out of that. In, and in my own religious de-conversion, I used to be extremely religious. I'm now spiritual rather than religious. Ah, my, my pre-encounter was accepting God as White and as a male and as all forgiving and then with, over time and, and maturity discovering the Holocaust, ironically I discovered the Jewish Holocaust before I discovered the African Holocaust and then eventually, that folding in, I could not believe there was a God that would even pull off those things. So that was my encounter. My immersion-emersion was going to live with that and then I became an existentialist when I had, uhm, uhm, internalization and then my long-term commitment is to neuroticism. Okay. (laughs) 

00:07:35
  (laughing). 

00:07:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  One of the, ah, dilemmas of being a PhD is that you weigh so many things that after a while you become aware that you almost lost, lost faith in anything and it, it makes for an interesting like. Okay. In the 1997 version, or 91, ah, 1971 version, pre-encounter was equated with various forms of internalized racism. Are you with me? Okay. Internalization stress habituation of new, of the new positive identity and each stage was linked to one archetype or what Janet calls status. So in a sense, if we had five stages, we ended up talking about as if there were five archetypes. Even though we were trying to say that, look, let's not gonna hung up on these archetypes, we're saying a person passes through one archetype to another as they hope to achieve internalization. When Tom Parham then wanted to measure the theory, okay, he then developed a scale that tried to separate out each of the stages. But in so doing, he was really what, separating out each archetype. Then some things happened between 71 and 91 that caused not just me, I, I had conversation with Parham on this but we're really pressed for time so I don't wanna sound like a total ego trip but I'll just give you some exam, exemplars. Ah, number one, we began to realize the following, that those of us who claim that, that we were the New Blacks of the 70s, have been raised by parents in, in many, ah, we're always raised by someone who is significant. But when we looked at our parents, we sometimes understood that they sometimes were in a different ideological frame than we were in. And we would have arguments over turkey and whatever, that barbecue in the fourth of July. And in that sense, we had changed. On the other hand, we saw, for the most part in ourselves we were okay with regard to being a human being, okay? Not perfect but we were okay. While we face this dilemma, how can someone who you're now are saying is ideologically behind us, ah, show, ah, produce, produce another human being who has a new consciousness and who also appears to be okay at the level of personality. Are you with me? We said, you know, we have to break apart this notion that personality and ideology are the same, because in a sense, we were made human at the personality level by our aunties, by our community and so on but we developed a political consciousness that sometimes was at odd with those persons who made us human in the first place. That constitutes an intellectual contradiction, attention and it has to be explained. And so that, that was one step in saying, hey, maybe in fact, PI and RGO are not the same, okay? And that meant maybe we have overly, ah, a stereotype pre-encounter, okay? Because if we're saying some of our parents are pre-encountered but nonetheless we're saying they had some strengths, then we had to go back to pre-encounter and explain how could a person be, may be at the personality level, a decent human being and at another level be someone you might be at odds with? Okay? That was, that was, that's, that's one of the intellectual dilemmas. The other thing that hit us with regard to the evolving research is that Kenneth Clark and Mamie Clark got it wrong. Okay? They, they, they got it right in the following sense. They were asked to produce evidence that could be presented to 9 White boys who were the Supreme Court in United States. 

00:11:15
 (laughing). 

00:11:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And they were gonna, gonna say to them, "Give us our freedom." Now, let's just set this aside, this is the first time in the history of the Supreme Court that the people would come before the Supreme Court and argue its political rights by psychological means. People always forget that, okay? But in that context, I'm sure I would have done what the Clark's did myself. I would find if, I would find as much evidence as I could to show that we had been damaged by the old system. You with me? But in doing that, we codified and ossified the notion of self-hatred in Black people. We made it appear as though the average Black person was self-hating. Okay. Well, we, when we got deeper into Black studies, and this comes, people forget this because sometimes people do their hooraying on Black studies. Black studies is like any other human invention. It is subject to critic but the idea that it somehow would grow out of it is just bullshit. I mean, ah, fundamentally, it is a way of taking our experience seriously. Okay. And people have to understand that. Where Black studies began and say, "Look, this doesn't make sense," because as we scan again, our parents, the average parent that we had was not self-hating. They were ideologically different. And so, that was another reason why we said, you know, look, somebody has exaggerated the extent of self-hatred in the Black community. That meant we have to go back and reexamine pre-encounter. Are you with me? And I guess the preacher is coming out. Okay. 

00:12:35
  (laughing). 

00:12:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Now, let's shift all the way over to internalization. And I just gave this example so those of you who are in the last session bear with me although it, it was true then, it's gonna be true now. 

00:12:50
 (laughing). 

00:12:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Okay. Ah, it was a lightning rod to invite, ah, Brother (inaudible [00:12:57.710]) to the campuses. Okay. We did invited him at least five times at the Cornell(ph) and it was never what was in issue because, you know, it, it was, he, he doesn't come anywhere without there being an issue. But it wasn't a big, big issue. And then one time, some, some of the brothers and sisters who I would say are born to the immersion-emersion stage, they wanna hit two birds at one time. They wanted to bring them up and they want to bring them up during the Oshishana(ph). (laughs) 

00:13:20
 (laughing). 

00:13:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Okay. Well, or was is it roth, roshishana(ph), pardon me. Okay. Okay. Okay. And we said, must we, okay. And it turns out that some of us who were saying must we, you know, can't we do it the next week or the next day? And there were others who were saying, you know, we should be ought to bring up whoever we wanna bring up, whenever we wanna bring them up. You know, how do you argue with that? And from my point of view as, as an observer, some of the people who are arguing for his presence were internalized Blacks. I knew them well enough. These were not immersion-emersion. Some of the people, some of the (inaudible [00:13:57.298]) member were internalized Blacks. And the people who were also saying 'can't we do this a different way?' they were internalized Blacks. But that meant that internalization was not a single archetype. That meant that the possibility that internalization could have multiple representations of what it meant to have a Black identity. This is all coming from out of those stuff, okay? So then I went back to the drawing board and I, I did, sorry, some, some research. For example, on that self-hatred thing, and you can do this for yourself. Except for the use of the mind, Jean Feeney(ph) scale, if you will set those studies aside and you look at the relationship between a myriad of Black identities scales and measures like self-esteem, there's almost no relationship between the two. And I know there's a, a recent meta-analysis that came out in the general, Psyche Bulletin. And if you'll look at that carefully, it, it stretches the imagination, ah, to say that self-esteem in Blacks has changed as a result of the movement. Okay. But setting that aside, I mean, you just don't find, and even when the, ah, ah, a correlation is found, guess what, it doesn't account for much variance. Now, understanding what that means, if I have two measures, a measure of consciousness and a measure of self-esteem, and they do relate sometimes but the only account for maybe fifteen to twenty percent of the variance. That means, we haven't accounted for the other Black people who apparently sometimes do, sometimes don't have high self-esteem and is independent of the issue of ideology. Are you with me? Okay. That means as a scientist, that means, again, we have to go back to the drawing board because we're making assumptions that we can't make. And I can give you more examples but there were a variety of, of both anecdotal and scientific reasons where the old model either had to be thrown aside or it had to be changed. And since I was going for, ah, ten year and um... 

00:15:40
 (laughing). 

00:15:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And full professorship, ah, the change in the model worked out. Okay. (laugh) 

00:15:45
 (laughing). 

00:15:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Well, by then I felt like we were really on to something. It just felt like we had to go from the evolution of a model that was done during a period of racial zeal, because in some ways, if you look back at Janet's early work, my early work and so on, we really weren't that concerned about pre-encounter. We were more concerned on zeroing in on internalization. What is that all about? We can skip over the other stuff, okay? And as a result, in '91, actually before that, you have to imagine that myself and other people around me, we were taking a deep breath and then we were reevaluating. We were prepared to throw the whole thing out but we didn't have to. And so, in the 1991 version and, and that goes for the expanded version as well. This was more influenced by discussions of what is the relationship between personal identity and reference group orientation and I've already discussed some of that, okay? When I say self-esteem, that's what, a personal identity variable. When I say group identity, that's a reference group notion. Okay. Good. We, we shifted the concern from positive-negative concerns to low salience versus high salience. This is a major shift in one's thinking. You have to back up and, and stop looking for the good identity versus the bad identity. And instead, you have to say, which identity or identities tend to, ah, give high salience to race and culture and which identities give low salience to race and culture. It turns out there is at least one, major one that gives negative salience to identity, that's the self-hating one. But for the most part, the issue becomes not good and bad but which one is informed by race and culture and which one almost seems to say, hey, that's not important. The Black 1960s and the current debate amongst people in this room, whether they're talking about, ah, gender, ah, being Chicano, Chican, Chicano, being Black and so on. You're almost saying, of all the identity options that a person might have, I'd like to see more Chicano's doing what, giving more salience to their Mexicanness. I'd like to see more Black people give more salience to their Blackness. I'd like to see more women giving salience to their being a woman. I'd like to see more gays being out and, and comfortable with it. That's what we're doing. But that doesn't exhaust what they could do but that's what we're saying in these models. And so, in a sense, the issue is not good or bad. That becomes your value judgment. We can come to that. But I'm gonna show you, as a scientist, you can argue the, the pros and cons of these identities without getting right away into good and bad but you can still show the, the political risk of a pre-encounter attitude, the political risk of a pre-encounter attitude. Are you with me? Not agreeing, you know, but you know, as preacher, we just wanna know if you're still there, okay? 

00:18:35
 (laughing). 

00:18:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  We wanted to move to a notion that each stage would be associated not with an archetype but with, in some ways, a multiplicity of identities, if you will, a cluster of identities. So pre-encounter is represented as a cluster of identities. Immersion-emersion is a cluster of identities and internalization should be viewed as a cluster of identities. And so that, that makes us work harder because if we have a cluster of identities, we have to say, well yeah, but what ties them together, okay? And then finally, the way in which, I will show you this kinda gets away from the theory (inaudible [00:19:18.455]), away from the theory but expands on it. And that's the whole issue of, look, even after I talk about a identity type or identity cluster, and then I go to my teacher friends, my counselor friends and my therapist friends and they sit there, sometimes smoking their pipes or whatever it is, if, if it's a woman, something else, sometimes a pipe too. (laughs) Uhm, they'll say that's all well and good that someone is high or low on this but what the hell does that have to do with how an identity is lived, how was an identity, identity lived. And I hope to touch upon that as well. Are you with me? Okay, okay. I have to reach over for this, okay. One of, ah, BJ don't get a heart attack but here we go. Okay. My, my, one of my buddies hates it when I talk about collapsing, ah, some of our scores by stage but I'm gonna do it. That's, that's, you know, when you're 64 and you have tenure or whatever else you can do, that kinda shit. Okay. (laughs) 

00:20:15
 (laughing). 

00:20:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Okay. I guess you had to edit that out. Okay. 

00:20:20
  (laughing). 

00:20:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  This looks like the kinds of results we can get and do get and did get when we use the Ria's(ph) or other measures, even Jake Maranni's(ph) measure. When we looked at what? A stage archetype and its relationship to what, self-esteem. Okay. Notice you'll see that pre-encounter has a negative, a robust, a robustly negative correlation to self-esteem. The more you are pre-encounter, what? The lower is you self-esteem. We get, even a pretty robust, well not quite as robust but a, a, ah, ah, less robust correlation with the immersion-emersion, and that makes sense because that's a state of "in-betweeness." And then, according to the theory, we get almost nothing going on with regard to internalization. Now, note something. Internalization looks good by itself because it's not correlated negatively, but it's not correlated positively. Are you with me? Okay. So it's looking good because these folks are what? Looking pretty bad, okay? And if you'll go back and you look at studies where they say internalization had the highest self-esteem, you'll see it did not have the highest self-esteem. It had no relationship to self-esteem. It was the other scales that was looking negative. So by comparison, internalization look better. Are you with me? Is that cool? (laughs) Okay. Now, with the crease, our new instrument, we are able to break out into the clusters, okay? Now, we have assimilated, pre-encounter, mis-educated, pre-encounter racial self-hatred, ah, and I'm using a version of the scale that the, that the larger crew doesn't use, so I have measure of anti-White, I have a measure of racial zeal or, or if you will, intense Black involvement. And then we have two versions of internalization, Afrocentric and multicultural. Now, let me first bring your eyes to these three, okay? Look at that similarity between assimilation, Afro-centric, multi-cultural. If you can't see it, that's because there's nothing going on there. There's no correlation. There's no negativity. There's no nothing. These three identities related to self-esteem had almost the same level, psychometrically speaking. Now what does that tell you? Okay. That one identity is no better than the other identity in achieving, now hold on to your horses, personal psychological well-being. Now this, not talking about community now, we're talking about personal psychology. So the assimilated identity which very much is a pre-encounter identity is, is no more vulnerable to lower PI characteristics than is the Afro-centric person, than as the multicultural-oriented person. Are you with me? Okay. Now, I know you wanna bite into that but just hang with me for a while, okay? If you think about it in real life, there are some people who are pre-encounter assimilated and they are politically and culturally very effective. And for the most part, you can't be politically and culturally very effective unless you don't have a strong personality. So those persons who would disagree with some of our particular political attitudes, they're effectively contesting us because of the fact that they have all of their opera, all their marbles operating at the same time. It's not just their ideology, and they are not sick. And to call them sick is in fact to do an injustice to your own values and to misunderstand totally where they're coming from. So I may hate Wor Cornelly's(ph) guts and I never met him, but I have to assume that until I get closer to him, that dude is one effective political being. I may dislike Shelvy Steel's(ph), ah, stupid framework about... 

00:24:00
 (laughing). 

00:24:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Ah, ah, ah, ah his notion of what it means to be a human being, okay? But I, we have to respect him with regard to the fact that he's one strong brother. Are you with me? Okay. Now, with regard to Afrocentricity, let's also get away from Black romance, okay? There, there is nothing, there's no panacea in Afrocentricity with regard to mental health. It's not a negative but it's not necessarily an automatic positive. So we all could become Afrocentric, and with regard to personality, that wouldn't guarantee us one thing or another. When you get low correlations, you have to understand what that means. There are Afrocentric people who are out to lunch... 

00:24:40
 (laughing). 

00:24:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And there are Afrocentric people who are very positive, likewise with multicultural, right? There are multicultural people who are out to lunch and there are multicultural people who you'd want to bring into your house, okay? 

00:24:50
 (laughing). 

00:24:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Now, where do, when we make this division, you know, and, and, sister, ah, Barbara, where are you? Are you, well I shouldn't imposed or she might not have come. Oh, Robert. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be presenting somewhere else. (laughs) I thought yours was at the same time as mine. 

00:25:05
ROBERT Earlier. 

00:25:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Oh, it was. That's nice. Congratulations. Bob Sowers(ph) and his new wife. (claps) 

00:25:15
 (clapping and laughing). 

00:25:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. God, what a treat to have them here so, okay. Whenever I, I meet him, he talks to me for five minutes and I have to go back to the drawing board, so good thing I didn't see him before that talks. He, he is absolutely one of the young Turks and his wife, ah, on the scene. I got ten more years, Bob before you can take over. Okay. 

00:25:35
 (laughing). 

00:25:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. The action coming up is in three areas, pre-encountered miseducation. But note, this is not a correlation that you take home to mother too. Okay. There's not a lot of variance, but there's some action going on, okay? Where the real action is, is in, what Kenneth Clark talked about in the first place. But now, for the first time in history and I'm not, I am into braggadocio. We have the only scale that consistently taps into what we mean by psychologically, someone who is racially self-hating. And when you, and not many people say yes to these items, but when they do, it has negative consequences. And these folks are robustly self-hating. And I'm not saying that under braggadocio. I'm just saying it is a real, reality. You just have to disengage it from these other dimensions. It turns out from my own point of view from, as a psychologist, our problem though is not in people who are racially self-hating. There are few and far between. The biggest number of people is really people who are miseducated. Because miseducation comes out of the TV. It comes out in the magazines. It's all over the place. And by miseducation, I mean, as Carl G. Witsunmet(ph) said, it's where you as a pre-normal person read or ingest information about your group that, that you now take as fact which turns out to be false. And as a result, if you take in too much of that, you sometimes can begin to see your group as a problem. And if you do that, you may not take your group but you may become estranged from your group. So miseducation is almost as bad as self-hatred because it leads in, leads to what the, (inaudible [00:27:12.409]) would say would be political estrangement. And to the extent that we are strange, to the extent that we hesitate to turn to each other, so in, in effect are we weaker as a group. Are you with me? Okay. And that's true, not just for us for any group. And of course, we do find though that there, there is also another cancer that's here and that is hatred. When you get down to it, being anti-White is a form of hatred. And if there's too much of that stuff, it ends up being a cancer in its own right. And yet, it's something we can avoid because sometimes, the other side does not pay, play fairly and it also does in gender notions of hate. As if I'm telling you something new. Now, you may say, okay, it's not just popping up on self-esteem, okay, (laughs) a leading question. No one is not. Okay. 

00:27:55
 (laughing). 

00:27:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Depression, self-esteem, life satisfaction, negative emotions, okay? We've measured this. Look at this. Assimilation, there's nothing going on. Do you see that? I mean, you can't see it because I deliberately made it gray because there's nothing going on, okay? Note down here with regard to Afrocentricity, nothing going on with the exception of a little bit of negative emotions and we can understand that because these people are often most in tune with some of the race issues. They're in the forefront. I'm not saying they're correct but they are often right up there in the edges. Okay. Likewise, the multicultural people for the most part, nothing going on. So when I tell you that we've isolated unfortunately but scientifically, I guess there is some joy in this, something that makes sense with self-hatred. It's showing with regard to depression, self-esteem, life satisfaction and almost not quite in this, in this one particular study, negative emotions. Okay. So if we look back, what we made a mistake with in the beginning is we learnt all these together. When you separate it out, it makes an amazing sense, okay? That we have some people who are pre-encounter assimilated, okay? But we have others who are, there's a miseducation and then there are those who are self-hating. We have some people who have a new or they have internalized or acquired whatever ah, ah, their habituated identity. It maybe Afrocentric or multicultural and, and in a sense, it's, it's not a bad identity but it's not necessarily a panacea to mental health. Am I making sense? Okay. That cool? Just break that stuff down. Okay. Okay. Now, I'm driving the cameraman nuts here, okay. If the difference between one identity and another setting self and hatred aside is not in personal mental health, then should we throw in the towel? Now, I want you to hold on to something. With the exception of some of the work that's happening with Robert and some of the other people, we have for years and years and years studied the relationship between what is it like to be a Negro, what is it like to be, like to be Black and personal mental health? That has stopped us as researchers and as a people from asking the question, "What in the real world is an identity for?" If it's not mental health, what does it do? It provides your meaning making system. And if it provides your meaning making system, it should be very powerful in predicting how you vote, how you frame issues, which things will make you hot, ah, how you will view members of your group or, or, ah, or, or whether you have a, a pan-Africans' point of view or whether you have an Ame, I mean, those are the important things. In some ways, we had been practicing ways in which to be politically neuter by stuttering, citing only PI variables. I'm not even saying that with the power, I'm so frustrated with the fact that we have forty, fifty years of research on PI and hardly any information on the relationship between identity types and political, cultural outcomes. Are you with me? Okay. And if we did, well with that, we'll be getting in, into more trouble. I can assure you that. But look what happens when you do do it, when you take the time to do it. Oh give me these categories and we'll try to talk about them. How are we doing in the back? Can you hear me? Can you read this stuff? Okay. Under identity, we have again, assimilation, miseducation, racial self-hatred, Afrocentricity, multicultural. Now, we see black spots all over the place. Remember the last one? It was kinda limited to just to some sectors. Now, it's popping up all over the place. Low race salience, a person who tends not to make race and culture very important to their lives, who has a positive correlation with that, it is the assimilated person. Okay. But ironically, those same people are likely to have a very robust correlation with conservative political attitudes. So on the one hand, they make it appear as though they're being color blind and then they make it their mission to make sure that you are color blind. 

00:32:00
 (laughing). 

00:32:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  And they do that by, by in fact attacking programs that maybe you control such as affirmative action. Are you with me? 

00:32:10
  Absolutely. 

00:32:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Okay. We don't need to talk about self-hatred under those conditions, okay? I mean, the issue becomes these people are persons that are worthy of our interest not because they're whacko's but because they have some very interesting political points of view. They show a great, this is never a Turrell's notion of cultural mistrust, okay? If you're high on cultural mistrust, it usually means some sort of estrangement to the larger society and sometimes the White people in particular. These folks have a negative relationship with cultural mistrust. That means now only do they reject cultural mistrust, if anything there kind of a (inaudible [00:32:48.306]) land and, and almost saying in a sense, hey, if anything, you know, one should trust the society, one should not be skeptical of White people who you meet. Okay. Racial stress. This blows people's minds. 

00:33:00
 (coughs). 

00:33:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Okay. And this is being replicated in works that we're doing in New York City. We're getting a negative relationship between people who are assimilated and either their perception of racism or whether or not they even feel racism. But if you think about it, this is consistent with the low race salience. If I don't see it and I don't think it's important, and then if you ask me a question about it, that not only do I not experience racial stress, I tell you, I don't even think it exists. And we've got some studies where this correlation gets into the point three, you with me? 

00:33:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And I'm reviewing a study right now, ah, where in fact they found the same kind of thing in another sample. So I mean, in a sense, it's consistent. And then finally, ah, ah, with regard to, um, um, anti-Whiteness which is a form of hatred, these folks are not suffering from that. That's not necessarily negative. They're not into hating Whites, okay. Well, that kind of ties in to the issue of cultural mistrust. If they had a risk, it might be into overly accepting and trusting of Whites. Okay. I know I'm being a bit hard-nosed but we only have an hour, okay? You know, in my article, I'll say there's a greater sad affair. Jesus, I'm being taped so I know someone who'll pin me down for the rest of my life. Okay. 

00:34:20
 (laughing). 

00:34:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Notice something about the miseducated people. They're not getting a lot of correlations. And just trust me because we don't have all time. This is because miseducation can appear with one identity versus another identity. Okay. But the one thing it does show is that if you are miseducated, you are at risk of also holding conservative political attitudes. In other words, if I am miseducated, I'm gonna be attracted to those programs that almost suggest that Black people are their own worst enemy, that Black people are the problem, and that the programs they're creating are holding them down. I know you scratch your head sometimes and saying, how can that man or woman stand up there and saying that affirmative action is bad? First of all, they probably got the wrong position by what affirmative an action. (laughs) Okay, okay. 

00:35:15
  (laughing) 

00:35:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. So, you will say, loss of memory. Okay, whatever. 

00:35:20
 (laughing). 

00:35:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  But then they are so often vigorous in their attack on the programs. It's coming out in our data, okay? If you, because it turns out that if you, if you interrogate, for example, Wor Connelly's(ph) position on American history, he says, "We're the only people being talked about affirmative action. That is just for now or historical, I saw, I saw a historical, it makes you choke. If you know anything about, for example, higher education, let me play with this a little bit, okay? 1940, the average White person was not a College graduate. The G.I. Bill occurs in 1945, 46, all of a sudden now, what do people do? We say, look, the average, and most of the time, this is more for Whites. The average White person, often White male, is not college-educated. So let's, let's expand the state system and bring them in. What's, what about qualifications? Let's take them where they are at, okay? I mean, the early origins of the movement of masses of Whites into middle class status was by institutions that were very friendly for where they were at in the first place. And in effect, we can use this term, terminology. In the earlier days of, of, of White-dominated public institutions, and including Harvard and, and the private institutions as well, they were transformative. They took people at one level and helped them to be transformed to another. Are you with me? Okay. Now, those turn people, same people over time in space have gathered political power and they now are very locked into another level. And they want those institutions to be replicative. What do I mean by that? They want them to replicate their children's status. And they are opposed to public institutions that also are trying to be transformative at the same time they are replicative. And that's where we get kind of pinched in, okay? Because we're saying, look, it is in the charter of public institutions to make educational accessible and affordable. It's in the charters. Go back and read your state institute, your state constitutions, those to be accessible and affordable. And so, affirmative action is really the resistance of those who have it, who don't want those public institutions to continue their long-term mission of making education transformative. Are you with me. So when people say they are having conservative political attitudes, it means our own, some of our own people are therefore against programs which the other side had in the first place. So we're not asking for something new; we're asking for the same thing that happened to other people. And that's why having conservative political attitudes in the low race salience is so politically dangerous. Because the fact of the matter is no other group made it without collective support. No other group made it without pouring millions of dollars into their education. No other group made it without building a puny University of Michigan in Michigan State. Then how the hell are we gonna make it just in our own bootstraps? It's a ridiculous historical proposition. Am I making sense? Okay. Racial self-patriot, they do pop up. I don't wanna focus on that so much other than the fact that they are often culturally mistrusting. They are often culturally mistrusting. They do experience racial stress and they feel a lot of, ah, hatred. Afrocentrics pop up, as well. Afrocentrics are least likely to be low in the race salience. They have a negative relationship. They have a strong degree sometimes of cultural mistrust. Ah, they definitely feel racial stress. And this is probably hard than it would be from one state to another. In this particular study, we had a very robust relationship with White hostility. Okay. Look at the multi-culturalist, they are flat. And if you remember back on the P.I. level, they are also flat. And at one point, I thought that's where we should be going. Where is Joe? (laughs) Is Joe still here? I don't think so. Well, you know, our data is suggesting some problematics with the multi-cultural perspective as we are measuring it. They're coming out flat. They're, they're something, and we don't know what's coming off. And I don't know if I can answer, I think BJ has some, some ideas about it and she may share it with us. But across multiple measures of RGO measures, these folks are just aren't showing stuffs. You with me? Okay. Well, isn't that cool? On the PI, on the PI variables, you get those kinds of patterns, but when you switch over to RGO variables, it makes sense. And now this is something you've heard me say but let me say it now with even more energy. If you do an RGO-based study, you should have RBO, R, R, RGO-based outcomes. If you do an RGO study, if you, in other words, if you do an identity study and then you measure self-esteem, you're not necessarily measuring what an RGO is, is trying to do. You're not getting at how it orients me toward life. You're just asking me the question do I feel good or bad about myself. Well, if I, if we're showing it, we're saying that's not the question. The question should be, what does RGO do for, for us? And that gets us into the new kinds of studies on racial stress, whether we're coping with it, on political attitudes, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. I'm repeating myself, right? Ah, I was gonna give maybe a, a, a little bit of a summary of the profiles of the different, ah, kinds of identities. Maybe I can do a little bit of this. Yeah, I guess I will. Okay. We're fine that the, the pre-encounter assimilated person is often personally mentally healthy. I hope I make that point emphatically, okay? We find that such, such positions often combine a color-blind stance with a hostile attitude towards social programs. Okay. And they're sincere about it. I'm making fun of it. These are very sincere, okay? These are often God-fearing, whatever people, okay? They are often hopeful and possibly embraced the larger society and they report positive feelings toward Whites. And this is the part that gets under your skin. They often report fewer racial incidences, and they have low racial stress. Is that, is that amazing, to live, live in a White world? (laughs) Okay. 

00:41:35
 (laughing). 

00:41:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  One of the things that we do in our research team is that we respect what the data is telling us. If it tells us over and over and over again. Okay. And if someone keep popping up saying, I don't see it, it means they don't see it. It's not for me to reject it as to try to understand it. Okay? Now, what risk factors are they about? They tend to see low-income Blacks as a drag on a race. This is to say, they are mis-educated, they tend to blame the victims, and as Sedeas(ph) Robert that we say, say his name as Robert Sedeas(ph), they tend to end up in a belief in social inequality. And what do I mean by that? If I have a belief of social inequality, it means I think the system is okay as it is. This system is based on social inequality. This is a capitalist system, okay? It is based on the notion of some people will win, some people will lose. When you are against social programs which you're trying to transform people, you're saying what? This system is okay. You're essentially are, are articulating a belief system that says social inequality is what? "Okay." That's part of the motivation. If you read the news, stupid book that came out by, uh, Abigail Thurstroms(ph), how do you spell her name? And her, her husband Steven. I mean, when you will you sit it down and you don't get too pissed at it, you realize and it says, they sincerely believe the system is okay. But what are they're saying by that? They're believing in social inequality. They believe that it's unfair to do something, as a social program, to move people along. What are they're saying about that? They're saying the people themselves should get to a point where they have high test scores so they can be admitted. Now, notice the absurdity of that proposition. I am poor, I am Black, I am a woman, I'm in the ghetto. I end up with a 3.5 and the toughest of systems and I score maybe 100 to 150 points lower than someone else. They're saying, "No, even if you're poor and you're Black and you're a woman and so on, the only way you get in to the school if you score the same way where the average person who scores at that level is upper middle class, White, suburban. You, you see the absurdity of that proposition? That, that's what you have, well, anyway, so okay. (laughs) 

00:43:50
 (laughing). 

00:43:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Too much miseducation, we're finding a path analysis, can lead toward racial sef-hatred. So there can be a connection between assimilation, miseducation, self-hatred. If I'm assimilated and I've taken too much misinformation, I increase the probability that I might end up seeing my group as bad, and it doesn't take much psychological distance to say well then maybe my ass is bad too. So it is a risk factor. It's not automatic, but it's a risk factor. And this is the thing that's amazing. It drives you nuts. That's the part I was gonna say. They see themselves as martyrs in fighting affirmative action and government solutions. You can always bring Wor Connelly(ph) to tears if you attack him. This is what I'm going do in God's will. And he believes that. He's, he's sincere about it, okay? And he's martyr in that sense. Profiles of Afrocentrist. They are as positive a pathway toward personal mental health, as our pre-encounter assimilated or multicultural. However, it is not a panacea. This is where I sometimes have tension with some of my more strict Afrocentric friends. They suggest that the only pathway for Black people to achieve personal mental health is through Afrocenticity. I don't, I'd just say, you know, let's test that. I've tested it. I'm not anti- Afrocentric, I'm just telling you. There's just no, no psychological panacea for one ideology versus another. There's some me making significance to having one kind of frame and another, but not psychological. In our, in the United States, there's just too many ways in which people can achieve personal happiness. They ex, they experience trust, they see it, they feel it. But interestingly enough, their identity open that as a coping mechanism against the stress. So unlike this self-hating person who sees it, feels it, and is crushed by it, people who have a Afrocentric or, if you will, a very race-salient identity, often that identity, even though it allows them to see things, it also ends up protecting them against the full brunt of stress. Is that amazing? So in one case, the person becomes vulnerable to the stress. And in other case, they can see utter clarity and they become what? Ah, they're, it allows them to cope. And that's why in a sense, if you think about it, you need someone out there who what? Sees it, feels it, whatever, but who also can cope and then come back and fight with it. Okay. And that's, that's part of the power of Afrocentrically-related high salience and so on. They have a skepticism toward the larger society. Not my choice of, choice of words. Immerssion-emersion people are, are whacko about this. But fully internalized Afrocentrics, they're skeptical. In, in any, in any kind of complex society, skepticism is your best friend, okay. Note what has happened to our society when we stopped being skeptical for two months after 9-11 and now, we, we're, we're big brother way beyond we thought we could ever be. Sorry again, I'm on tape. (laughs). I'll be in jail by next week. Okay. 

00:46:45
  (laughing). 

00:46:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  They can be distrustful of Whites. And there's a port, a part, a way which some of the day shows that sometimes they can be very jealous, sometimes they're not. Sometimes they're very calm, sometimes they're not very calm. I have Joe White and Tommy Parham. I hope they let me pick on him, over here, you can't fight him, a mellow Afrocentric brother than Thomas Parham. Okay? But then there's some other people I would not name. (laughs) 

00:47:20
 (laughing). 

00:47:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Who are off the charts and some of the, their volatility, and their racial zeal. Their world view is very African-centered and we've gone on from kind of a reactionary Africanity. If you go back and look at some of the earlier tapes by, okay, the brother temple, help me out, the (inaudible ). Okay. He used to have, he used to do a lecture and he would say, he's doing an afrocentric lecture. I wanna say, I love you so I'm on tape again. Ah. But the whole thing was based on anti-Whiteness. You just go back and look at his early tapes. If you've ever heard him in the last what, four or five years, is just mind-blowing. Almost all his exemplars about what you don't know about Africa. What you don't know, what you, what you think you know about Africa and, and he's, he's just, it's just one of the most amazing experiences. And as a result, his Africanity, his Africanity is solidly anchored in the historical, ah, cultural respect, and, and he sees it being reactionary. And it's an amazing commitment to um, um, did I clean it up, (inaudible )? (laughs) Okay, okay. Risk factors, ironically under some conditions, hold on to your hats, we are finding some Afrocentrists are miseducated. That is to say, in their pushing the proposition that we must change, sometimes they will argue the case, they will argue stereotypes as truths about Black people. If you've ever heard brother (inaudible ), sometimes I get some of his speeches, some of his speeches are laced with notions that are essentially stereotypes about Blacks. Now, his motivations is to try to get us to change things. But if you play it out, and I hope I've said that with respect, it often is trying, ah, it's often presenting a political motivation based on stereotypes. And so there's, it's not suprising that sometimes you'd find it popping up in an Afrocentric frame. I don't need to tell you this. It doesn't take much, ah, ah, brain surgery to note that if you have too much cultural mistrust, if you have too much antipathy towards anyone, if any, if you start easing into really intense hatred, that raises problems. Not only in your ideological stance, it even raises problems in your personal stance. And sometimes, some people can find it very hard to move from the transition stage, and it's context driven. The situation in which they're living in is, is so negative. Their battles with race is so everyday that sometimes it's almost as though they're stock in the motive of, of IE. I'm gonna go on, okay? Multi-culturalist. Three to four studies out of New York group, we're finding, as I showed you already, the multi-culturalists are flat, both in terms of what they, what it is with regards to the P.I. variables and with regards to the RGO variables. We are finding it very hard to find predictors of multi-culturalism. And we're looking forward, okay? And I, if I had a bias, I started out kind of liking them. I thought I was one of them. (laughs) Now, I'm not so sure. (laughs) Okay. 

00:50:10
 (laughing). 

00:50:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  We have found a couple of instances, again this afternoon, we replicated again, multi-culturalists who show a negative relationship with White patriot. In other words, they don't have it, in other words, their habits is very low. And who have a negative relationship with mis-education, you with me? They don't have that. Their identities, ah, their identities often show an enhancement of self-esteem. Isn't that amazing? So there's something about not allowing some of those cancers to eat away at you, actually it can add to a higher self-esteem. And Kenny Foster(ph), are you in the room? Where's Kenny? He may have had to leave. Kenny is doing a dissertation, he's found the same thing perhaps happening with Afrocentrists. If they can contain the level of self-hatred, if they contain the level of mis-education, they now, they go from not, not showing a relationship of self-esteem to having an, an enhanced self-esteem. So in some ways, we need to get away from talking about just self-hatred. And we should talk about the other kinds and ways in which we cope with our society, okay? How am I doing? Okay. Too slow? Risk factors. Ah, not clear as yet. But bland is maybe a mask for hiding, hiding behind some degree of estrangements from the group. And that made me feel very uncomfortable, as BJ would know, to, to say. I'm not, we're gonna have to do some more research here. But I, they're coming out so flat, that I'm just wondering if, if there's, there's a form of multi-cultural that ends up being problematic. And maybe you already know that, okay? (laughs) 

00:51:50
 (laughing). 

00:51:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Okay. Then I'm just joining your parade. Okay. So in case I have already said this. Give me, don't get me wrong. I'm not celebrating it. But as Bob Sellers and other people in the room would tell you, we've had this term thrown at us for 40, 50 years. And yet if you do the time to research it, you'd find, people have not had very good measures of. Okay. And we've got it. It's only, like four or five items. And it's such things as the following. And we softened it up. We said, it's the, I, I won't give you the exact because I don't have in front of me. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I don't feel good about what I see in the mirror. Okay. In fact we have a, at least sometimes, when I see my black image in the mirror, I don't always feel good about it. Or another item says something like the following, privately, my friends don't know of it, but sometimes I have trouble about being Black. Now, what do we do in those items? We talked about the trouble with the self, but we absolutely have to have an explicit mention of what, being Black. So when people say yes to those items, it's, it's, it's certainly they're fighting against social desirability, but in the privacy of privacy of the room, with the scale, we're getting people, you know, that trust us because we don't know their identities. And we don't wanna know who they are. I mean, that's, that's not our business. But when they are honest with this, I'm telling you folks, they show depression, they show lower ego identity and so on. So the original theory of pre-encounter, ah, is what's correct. It's just that we kept lumping it into all pre-encounter types. But people who are pre-encounter, racially self-hating, we can almost tie this back into the whole 40 years of the literature. Trouble is, most of that literature was anecdotal, done through essays. But, and my hat's off to the Clarks, they were right, in one way. They just exaggerated their results. 

00:53:50
[sil.] 

00:53:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Low race salience. You've read my work, you know that in some ways I've talked about low race salience as much as I have about pre-encounter. Because when we were working on this concept, we first started to try to do because Bob Sellers(ph) has a wonderful scale, a racial centrality scale. But when, when you read the items, for the most part, they're, they're balanced between negative and positive. To, to make a long story short, we found that if we soften the item and said something like the following, for all the things in life that bring me joy, notice how that is that pretty powerful statement, right? For all the things in life that bring me joy, race solemn has anything to do with it. 

00:54:30
 (coughing). 

00:54:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. (whistles) That's a tough, okay? That's a hard one to, to reverse it. We, we're finding, we can, we can wear items that consistently get at low race salience. And it's just like those self-hating items. When a person says yes to those items, you're, you're tapping it to a very powerful stuff. It's not negative stuff but it is very powerful stuff. So we have been more successful, ironically, ah, ah, of developing a low race salient scale. We have been less successful to (inaudible [00:55:01.359]) has done to develop a high race salience scale. So what I'm about to tell you is not, does not mean that the opposite is true. But likewise, and, and bear with me Robert, if you use a high salience measure, the opposite is not true in that case either. Are you with me? You have to watch out. You have to have a measure that explicitly breaks out: high salience and low salience. And you can't take a low score on a high salience measure as the same thing as something that is explicitly getting at low salience. Are you with me? Well, you have to agree with me but something's going on because these people are not necessarily as assimilated in, in, in the sense of being Americanized. These are people who might be, and, and, and hear me out now, they might be people who are gay, okay, and who make being gay the dominant issue in their lives and they just don't deal with race that much. That's different from being assimilated, okay? Assimilated tends to be tied into being pro-American. So that they're not necessarily pro-American but they're saying there's something else that gives me, what, joy in my life. Are you with me? I would not be surprised that this kind of measure either becomes a part of the crest or it gets used a lot, but we have to do the psychometrics that show that it's strong. But let me show you how it's not the same thing as someone who's assim, assimilated. Remember some of those items we had before? Cultural conservative, mistrust, racial stress, race events in one's lifetime, and a new item, ah, whether or not you think other Black people see you as supportive of them. Whether or not you, you think other Black people see you as supportive of them, okay? Are you with me? Okay. The pre-encounter assimilated show up on two dimensions on conservative attitudes and they have a negative relationship as to whether or not they see other, whether or not they think other Black people see them as supportive of them, okay? Another example of what, Sonya(ph), estrangement as opposed to self-hatred. This estrangement can be as powerful as self-hating. Someone is self-hating that too because they dislike us, okay? Someone who's politically estranged may do it politely but they, it's the same result. They pull back their what? Energies from interacting with you. But look at the low race salience people, they're whopping up all over the place. They're showing conservative political attitudes. They, they, they're the opposite of cultural mistrust. They don't see stress, okay? They, ah, they, they say they had not had many, ah, ah, racial stressful events in their lifetime. And in fact, it's not as high as the PA people but they're also showing some estrangement from Black people. So in, in some ways, this is an example of this and not the other way around. And this may end up being as powerful a way of us having conversations around ourselves. In other words, maybe it's more important for us to talk about pre-encounter low race salience, and then maybe go down to some other category such as PA, ah, pre-encounter assimilated. Am I making sense here? Okay. Let me be very clear. This is not a part of the crest at this moment because one of the things that Dr. Vanderberg(ph) has done in, in enlightening me as a psychologist is that it often takes years for a scale to be valid enough that you can make really whopping generalizations. One of the biggest problems in our field is in, bear out with me, those of you who are PhD students, (chuckles) is that we develop a new scale, we get to elf-up(ph) high enough for our dissertation, and then we get our PhD, okay? But then, Elaine and I say, "We need a, we need a measure of so and so." And we do our lead search and we say, oh, Jonesey what's your, I'll pick on you, what's your name? 

00:58:50
FREDERICK Frederick. 

00:58:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Frederick has a new scale for measuring Black X, okay?

 (giggling sound). 

00:58:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. It's got an alpha of 0.72. Its sample was 150. So we use it in our scale and the next time we use it, the alpha does what, falls down to 0.43. Because in a sense, you have to do at least some replications of two or three or four times with different samples before, you know, you can see, is your scale really what it should be? Okay. So I'm not suggesting we're ready to go here but I'm working very hard in the vineyards of New York City to make low race salience something that my esteemed colleague, Dr. Vanderberg(ph), will accept, okay? (laughs) We'll shift gears now. Ah, what time are we? Oh boy! What time are we in? Five? Oh, shit, you know. 

00:59:40
 You have 15 minutes. 

00:59:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Yeah, right. Okay. All right, I'll just tell you a little bit. 

00:59:40
  (laughing). 

00:59:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. I'll just tell you a little bit about what we're doing, you can write me for this. I'm working with, ah, Linda Strauss(ph) at Penstate(ph) and we have shifted gears and we're trying to look at how is identity lived in everyday life? We're combining two intellectual frames of reference: Goffman's notion of identity performance and Vygotsky's notion of identity activities. And we're asking the questions, how is Black identity enacted, played out in everyday life? You have to bear with me. I'm gonna tease you on this one. When we ask this question, we're asking it from the frame of reference of A-way Boykin in which he says, really, there is no one world that my identity has to help me operate in. If anything, there are at least three worlds in which a Black person has to have, their identity has to have some flexibility to allow them to live on an everyday basis. They have to be able to transact issues of oppression, are you with me? That's an easy one. They have to be able to transact everyday life experiences in situations not controlled by me or you or us, okay? That is, someone else has power. They run IBM, they run Boston College and we work there, okay? And so, what are the demands on an identity when you're in an environment that's not necessarily hostile, but the, but the cultural milieu is maybe different from the way you would act as a Black person when you're in a Black community. The implication there is for what? Coat switching, okay? And likewise, there are sometimes instances, well not sometimes, likewise, one is not born connected to Black people. Okay? One has to work at it. It's, it's often fun, okay? Especially as a little kid, you learn of celebrations, the holidays, the language system and so on. But let's be clear about it. Black people are not born connected to other Black people. They have to work at it, and I'm using work in a friendly kind of way. And so there's also transacting strangers among Black people. Okay? We are working on the notion that there are at least five ways in which identity is transacted in everyday life. I'm gonna skip over the proofs. I'm just gonna deal with the concepts. And we don't say there aren't more than five ways, but we think these are the crucial ways. And they're really cool ways because they can be enacted in psychodrama, they have implications for therapy and so on. Number one, buffering. Sometimes, your identity has to help you buffer when you have encounters with racism. And it's tricky because sometimes you have to buffer against the racist stuff that's coming in and still relate to that person on other issues. (laughs) Is that something, okay? 

01:02:25
 (audience respond) 

01:02:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. So the person who's, who's causing me a problem is my, my Math teacher, okay? Or the one teaching me Path Analysis. And he or she kinda says something and lets me know that I'm not so sure that their head is on-straight with regard to issues of race in a general sense. So, I, as long as he or she doesn't cross that line while I'm in the classroom, we're okay. But what am I doing? I'm protecting myself against the possibility that he or she will say it in a racist event, right? But I'm leaving myself open to absorb their information about path, about path analysis. Are you with me? That's the dilemma and that's why sometimes our kids are put in trick beds. Their notion is, you know, F all of them, well? 

01:03:00
 (laughing). 

01:03:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Yeah. But that, that's the assumption that, and they often would call Math White, okay? We call it geo-, you know, where is that coming from? Mathematics sentence's origin is African. But if I use to, what, opaque a buffering mechanism, I not only block out the racism, I block, block out those things that are race-neutral. Okay? That's our challenge, okay? Coat-switching. This is the fun one, and you know, you do it, you know, you do it, I have an old Black scour and some of the young men and women come up, "Hello, fussy girls. How are you?" (chuckles) If I followed them down the hall, "I met the old dude." (laughs). Okay. 

01:03:40
 (laughing). 

01:03:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Coat-switching is not necessarily a negative thing. It's a way where you're not being inauthentic, although again, some of our kids take it the wrong way. They think I'm being phony; I'm being a frank. But I have fun with it. I, I know some of you heard the example, so stay with me. (chuckles) And there's one boy, he was a boy, he was a young boy saying, I don't coat-switch, you know, I front. I said, yes you do, you coat-switch everyday. So I had him walk over to a corner of the room and I said, "Well, come, come, come walk toward me and pretend you're talking to one of your homies, okay?" And so he, he got down... (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
 (laughing). 

01:04:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And he was, I can't do it. I'm, I'm too bushwa. (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
 (laughing). 

01:04:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  So he, he was coming toward, you know, and he was, he was, in, in Ebonics and I said, "Stop!" I said, ah, "Look behind you. See, see the woman there in the glasses? That's Mrs. Peaches(ph). Say hello to her." And he started to say, "Yoh, Mrs. Peaches. And the whole room just cracked up. So there's no way you're gonna say hello to an elder in that fashion. He, he straightened up. He looked at her and says, "Hello." And then I said, " Okay. Go on to what you're gonna do." And he, he did. I said what do you call that? He says I was showing respect. 

01:05:00
 (laughing). 

01:05:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And I said, "Isn't it interesting that politically, you feel comfortable coat-switching with her, but when sometimes we ask you to entertain it in the classroom, you feel like you're being phony." In other words, you've been so politicized. I wasn't blaming the dude. I said, I said, "You've been so politicized that with regards to your gaining knowledge to be able to build a bridge, or to be able to lead an army, or to be able to lead a revolution, in those concepts, situations you feel like you're being phony. But in this situation, you said you're, you're showing respect. I said, "You need to entertain the notion that you are coat-switching in each instance. And you need to examine, not whether you coat-switch or not, but why it has been so politicized that you feel as though you're being phony in one context and not in another." Am I making sense? 

01:05:40
 (audience reply softly). 

01:05:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Okay. But note how, you note what I just did. I used a vignette to be able to engage the dude and that's what's so powerful about these exemplars. I can't do all of them because the ladies got to sign up in the back. We're trying to identify -- well, I'll do, do one more, okay. Okay. I'm gonna skip, skip over bridging. I'm gonna go to bonding and attachment. When we first went into the field, we were still being romantic. And we thought, well, Black people use their identity for positive interactions with other Black people. And what we found when we went to the field, is just, yes, yes, there are times when Black people will what? Bond and attach to other Black people. But then we were told by this, by the subject themselves but there are other times when I buffer when I'm with other Black people. There are other times when I coat-switch when I'm with other Black people and I think that blew my mind the most because I can understand buffering, okay? I'm (inaudible [01:06:37.120]) , I walk into the room and some say, "Is that mother-fucker Bill Cross?" 

01:06:40
 (laughing). 

01:06:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  And I, and I, I reached, I reached that point in my career where it doesn't always bother me, okay? 

01:06:50
 (laughing). 

01:06:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Or it's, or it's even more fun when someone comes up to me and says, " Where is Bill Cross?" 

01:07:00
 (laughing). (tapping sound) 

01:07:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. All right. Okay. 

01:07:00
 (laughing). 

01:07:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  So I can see buffering because, you better believe I buffer in some instances, okay? 

01:07:10
 (laughing). 

01:07:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And in coat-switching, we can understand that, too. Sometimes, the dude that has power, who runs IBM is Black or, or who you're trying to get the loan from. And it's, it's, it's certainly fun to see us become so officious with another Black person. And that's where we get the (inaudible [01:07:24.113]) kind of scenarios. (laughing) Anyway, okay. Bridging. That's the one that's fun. I would argue very quickly that when a person from the continent, from the continent interacts with an African-American, they are into often bridging than they are being attached because they have to negotiate the real cultural differences. If you examine those interactions, the kinds of mechanisms that occur are almost the same kinds of mechanisms of the evolution of a close friendship with a White person. And I know that blows your mind. But it's almost on the same level, because to a certain extent, an African is a stranger to an African-American and vice versa. No stranger is bad, but different, okay? And any of you who've been to the continent when you got off the, off the, the plane, and you bent down and kiss the soil... 

01:08:10
 (laughing). 

01:08:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. And you rose up and thought they were gonna embrace you, they said, "Hello, American. How are you?" 

01:08:15
 (laughing). 

01:08:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Well, okay. 

01:08:15
  (laughing). 

01:08:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR.  Well, we gotta stop, but let me show you something that Pina(ph) and I had done. And if we give you, if we make you dizzy, we're proud of it. 

01:08:30
 (laughing). 

01:08:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. We have developed a lifespan perspect, perspective that starts in childhood, Sector 1, all the way over to Sector 6. And that would be Tom Parham's, ah, Negro songs recycling. And so, I can say the following to you, if the good Lord gives me a few more years, you're gonna see a book that's gonna come out. It's got, now, I'm gonna talk about Negro songs. It's gonna talk about early childhood, pre-adolescence, adolescence, early adulthood, Negro songs which is really an adult experience, and last but not least, what Tom Parham calls "identity recycling." Sorry, camera-person, we'll get there in a minute. What we've done with Parham's notion is to modify it in the following way. Tommy used to say that recycling meant pre, going through a pre-encounter, encounter whatever scenario again. That doesn't make any sense. If I already have a Black identity, and then I have an encounter, I'm not going back to stage 1. Instead, I have, I have a, I have a foundational Black identity and then something along, along the lifespan present me, presents me with a new question. And understand this, this is, remember, Black identity (inaudible ) that these are all social constructions, and by definition they can't be perfect. And what Tommy is getting at is that as you evolve, you're going to bump up against questions that you couldn't answer two years ago. You weren't even ready for them. So when you resolve them, what do you do? You, given there, their positive, you add them to the layer that you have. And over time, if you are lucky, if you are lucky, and we have Elaine Peter Hughes in the room, you become a woman who is wise in her blackness. With that in mind, let me bring it to a close. I know we had to short-circuit this. Egress, Egress's(ph) theory has expanded from a model of consciousness change during child, adulthood to a lifespan perspective that tracks identity development across infancy, and so on. And I just realize we're so out of time. I'm, I'm not gonna do the whole summary thing because it, it doesn't make any sense. It will take me too long. Ah, let me summarize myself in the following way. I've been one very, very fortunate human being, first of all, because of the support of people like you in the room. I've tried to pay you back as a, as a PhD person by taking our experience very seriously, very seriously. I've tried to show, by the way, I live my flawed life. That it is a fun experience that we as a people are wonderful. We can be evil, but we can be wonderful. But that for those who try to say our stuff is simplistic, that is almost attacking our humanity. All the other human beings I know are complex human beings and why shouldn't our theories be complex? Not for a tit for tat, but that means if we're human, then it's not gonna be so easy to understand who we are. But if you take the time, and if as you do as our research team has done and you develop your instruments with as much care and love as you think you have in you, and let a couple, or two or three years go by, then you reach the point which I think I've reached today. I'm not bragging on myself. That's not where I'm coming from. I'm just simply saying there's so much there to be harvest that sometimes if you take your time, you will harvest it. And I thank you for allowing me to participate with you. Thank you.
