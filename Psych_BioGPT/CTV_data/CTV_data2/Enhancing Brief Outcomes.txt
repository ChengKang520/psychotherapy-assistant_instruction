00:00:35
MICHAEL MUNION Good afternoon. Have you all met Fernanda? Fernanda Medina from Mexico City, also one of the institutes, right? And I'm Michael Munion. We're gonna do a clinical demonstration here this afternoon. So, Fernanda, why don't you and I pretend, pretend. I like that idea pretend there is no body here, there is just us. So what I want you do is to just take a moment, settle in… Is this okay for you all or do I need to sit… 

00:01:15
FERNANDA MEDINA Oops! 

00:01:20
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. So would you be kind enough to just take about 60 seconds, close your eyes take a nice deep breath, and it's been an interesting congress up till now. And you got all these experiences just wants you to let that all go. Just a present here in this room. I can use the low that myself. And we feel like you achieve that… Just orient back to our conversation. Thank you. And did you have some change in mind that you would like to create for yourself today? 

00:02:10
FERNANDA MEDINA To be more clear 

00:02:15
[sil.] 

00:02:20
FERNANDA MEDINA After transition complex, transition in my life. 

00:02:25
MICHAEL MUNION I would love it if you would say a little bit more, could you be more clear about what that mean? 

00:02:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Having more clarity. 

00:02:35
[sil.] 

00:02:40
FERNANDA MEDINA This year has been a very stressful year, my daughter was hit by a car, it was a car accident, it was… She had a knee surgery. 

00:02:50
MICHAEL MUNION Recovering? 

00:02:50
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:02:55
MICHAEL MUNION So all that's moving forward in a direction where comfortable with words going? 

00:03:00
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:03:00
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks. Still traumatizing, but moving forward. 

00:03:10
[sil.] 

00:03:15
FERNANDA MEDINA So I also got separated from my 26 year relationship that's all for moving forward. 

00:03:20
MICHAEL MUNION Big transition. 

00:03:25
FERNANDA MEDINA So in transition. 

00:03:30
MICHAEL MUNION So you got the daughter's accident and her injury and recovery and we've got this major life transition with, with leaving that 26 years marriage. 

00:03:40
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:03:45
MICHAEL MUNION Wow. So and I'm still working on getting my clarity with what, what clarity after transition means to you? 

00:03:55
FERNANDA MEDINA I think that the most difficult thing when I got separated was like… Now what? Uh, I realized that I was very identified or identified myself very much with those… How those 26 years of life were and… 

00:04:15
MICHAEL MUNION Kind of an identity, almost that's this is who I am. 

00:04:20
FERNANDA MEDINA And so my kinds are old. I kind of experiencing at the moment the… How do you say it the nest emptiness. 

00:04:30
MICHAEL MUNION Emptiness. Absolutely. 

00:04:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. Because both my kids are older. My daughter is living somewhere else, my son is also doing his thing. So I got separated, emptiness, and accidents like all in the same year. 

00:04:55
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah, kind of like a whole… It's probably a phrase I shouldn't use here, we're kind of an whole shit storm. Yeah? 

00:05:05
FERNANDA MEDINA So I'm truly, I felt a bit lost like not that. So I forget a little bit that I was a psychotherapist. And I went like what I'm, what I'm like… And I realized that I was identified the lot with what I was doing in my life. 

00:05:25
MICHAEL MUNION Mother, spouse, partner… 

00:05:25
FERNANDA MEDINA And then suddenly nothing of, of that was happening anymore. So I was like an earthquake. 

00:05:35
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah, yeah. Everything is in disarray. 

00:05:40
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. So I'm now I'm in the phase of going back again to having a sense of direction. So that's where the clarity comes. 

00:05:55
MICHAEL MUNION So the clarity is by don't yet know where I'm going and it would be nice to have that… 

00:06:00
FERNANDA MEDINA No, I think it's more than, I want to believe again that where I'm my life as a professional is going, it's like… None of what I had before is there any longer. It's okay. So I want to kind of I don't know. I know where I want to go, but it's like a kind of believing it again, you know. I don't if it's very clear. 

00:06:40
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. That's all for. Can you articulate that? 

00:06:40
FERNANDA MEDINA Like when I came to the conference, I will, I felt like… It's that's part of me, that's part of what I'm doing, that's nice it feels. I even felt safe here. I mean, nobody knows that, that's… I was like, "Oh, lots of therapists. That's good." That's one thing that I have been doing for a long time. And then starting to see faces that I know. I kind of felt that's me. 

00:07:10
MICHAEL MUNION Reconnected? 

00:07:10
FERNANDA MEDINA Yes, reconnected. 

00:07:15
MICHAEL MUNION And is that fair language to use with all those other phases of your life is the emptiness good things feels disconnected not really but not connected in the same way. 

00:07:25
FERNANDA MEDINA I feel disconnected. Yes. I felt. Sorry. I felt disconnected. I don't feel disconnected now but I'm reconnecting. So I think that's the clarity I mean, it's like uh… deeper clarity of connection. Yeah. With what I know with what I do and with new possibilities. 

00:07:50
MICHAEL MUNION So and just for, since we're talking about clarity, for my clarity. There result is not a transformation in your professional life. I hear it in your, you know, your partner relation and relation with your daughter. But professionally is that in transition as well? 

00:08:15
FERNANDA MEDINA Well, I also thought of the possibility of coming to the United States. So that would be a geographical and difference in profession. Yes, because if I was for example going to work here there are some other things that I would have to do completely different than in my country. So I'm looking at all those possibilities too. So, yes, I'm kind of open to the movement, to change geographically. And I think that this profession is what is keeping me focused at the moment. 

00:09:05
MICHAEL MUNION It's kind of the steady thread through all this disruption that you just been through which is really unsettled, non-settling, and at this point it feels like the major disruption, the earthquake is the aftershocks rover… Now you're kind of sorting through all that and to rebuild. 

00:09:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Rebuild. Yeah. 

00:09:30
MICHAEL MUNION Was that a fair metaphor for that? 

00:09:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. So I think I'm in the rebuild state. And sometimes it's difficult because the faces I used to see are not there. 

00:09:45
MICHAEL MUNION Right. So it feels just a little still disconnected. And in terms of that, if we're gonna use that rebuild metaphor, you're still meeting with architects and trying to figure out what's this new life is gonna look like. 

00:10:00
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:10:00
MICHAEL MUNION Is that…? 

00:10:00
FERNANDA MEDINA That's correct. 

00:10:05
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. So, you know, as that goes I have some clarity on the, on the change… And you've really kind of help me out with some of that history is. What have you tried just in terms of getting that clarity that you want? Have you been looking for that? 

00:10:25
FERNANDA MEDINA I have tried for being on my own. That was very difficult because for 26 years I was never on my own. I mean, I didn't even live on my own when I was a teenager. I know, like lots of teenagers here when they go to college, going away, in Mexico it's not like that. So I didn't have the experience of living on my own. I kind of went from my parents' house. I did, I have traveled a lot. So that has been different, I have lived in different countries. But like from my mother's house I got married down then, now I'm not. I'm not all… living on my own and being on my own has been one thing that I not used to. 

00:11:10
MICHAEL MUNION Kind of a bold thing, yeah? Kind of a bold thing intends bold, uh, courageous to go out and live on your own when for all those years… 

00:11:25
FERNANDA MEDINA It's scary. 

00:11:30
MICHAEL MUNION Scary? And wouldn't be surprising if I said if it wasn't scary, it wasn't courageous. 

00:11:35
FERNANDA MEDINA No it is. Yes, I guess. 

00:11:40
MICHAEL MUNION It's not bravery when it's easy. 

00:11:40
FERNANDA MEDINA Okay. Yeah, I think I haven't, I hadn't seen that way like… Wow. 

00:11:50
MICHAEL MUNION So good. And how does that, how does that feel that, that having taken those steps to that kind of courageous… 

00:11:55
FERNANDA MEDINA Still scary. 

00:12:00
MICHAEL MUNION Still scary? if, If you had to do it again, would you still take those scary steps that way? 

00:12:10
FERNANDA MEDINA If I had to do what? 

00:12:15
MICHAEL MUNION If you came to that point again and you said, "Okay, it's my life, it's a disarray here, maybe I could go back and live with family someone would take me in or I can go do it on my own." Would you go ahead and do the courageous thing? 

00:12:30
FERNANDA MEDINA I'm doing it. Yeah. 

00:12:35
MICHAEL MUNION Yes. Good, good. So it's not regrettable, it's just a little challenging, a lot challenging. 

00:12:40
FERNANDA MEDINA A lot. 

00:12:40
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. Okay. Well, that's helpful for me to know. So this idea of clarity tell me why that's important to make that change, to develop that clarity? 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:05
FERNANDA MEDINA Because if I, if I'm able to see in a different way, maybe it's not going to be so scary. 

00:13:10
MICHAEL MUNION So less scary? 

00:13:15
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:13:15
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. Any other good reasons that you wanna have that clarity? 

00:13:20
FERNANDA MEDINA No, that's a good reason. 

00:13:20
MICHAEL MUNION That's a good reason, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. I like it. Okay. 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:35
MICHAEL MUNION So once you… 

00:13:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Okay, it was very scary, it has been very, very, very scary. 

00:13:40
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. I can worry very, very, very. So that's a good reason I wasn't, you know, dismissing that reason. I just thought there might be more than one reason that you wanna make this change but that's good. 

00:13:55
FERNANDA MEDINA No, I want to be able to perceive it in different ways. So I feel more courageous than scary, than scared. 

00:14:05
MICHAEL MUNION Got you. Would, would more courageous mean just the scariness is still there but in a more comfortable with it maybe… 

00:14:15
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:14:20
MICHAEL MUNION Is that a good way to thing about? Okay, just so that I understand, I need clarity to do. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:30
MICHAEL MUNION Um… So take it minute, close your eyes, and we're not doing hypnosis here, what I want is for you just kind of access what's inside. I want some sense of a vision of what is that look like when you're way more comfortable with the scary when you have that clarity maybe, you've been to the architect now, and you've got some, some clarity on what you're gonna at least aim at. And when you feel like you've got a little better sense in that lesion, this is important me to have that where we're going kind of thing. What does that look like? 

00:15:20
FERNANDA MEDINA It helps me to see that… On the first hand I don't have to be in just one place. I can be in different places. 

00:15:30
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. 

00:15:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Because I kind of thought I have to be either in Mexico or somewhere else. And now I can think that I could be in both places for example. So it would made, it would made me more international. 

00:15:50
MICHAEL MUNION More international. 

00:15:55
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. No, it's… I mean, I'm serious. 

00:15:55
MICHAEL MUNION No, no, no. I'm great with that I think it's an excellent idea from that down there in your gut place that's, you know, that part of the transition where you have different relationship with that fear, that scariness. What's that like when, when you successfully transformed that? Because that's the change, big part of the change you want is greater comfort with that. 

00:16:30
FERNANDA MEDINA A greater confidence, confidence in that I can do both. That I don't have to be in on place. And my that can to it on my own. Well, not completely on my own but without family. 

00:16:50
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. Beautiful. So, so the outcome we're aiming at is we've got great confidence, we're moving towards this kind of multinational practice, right. We don't have to limit it to just Mexico and the United states, Canada, you know, we have friends in Europe. So… But as that, that… You get that clarity there. 

00:17:20
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. I have lived in Scotland and Australia. So, yeah, there are other places in the planet. 

00:17:25
MICHAEL MUNION I was thinking that was a Scottish accent that I was detecting but… No? 

00:17:30
FERNANDA MEDINA No. 

00:17:30
MICHAEL MUNION No. Okay. So we've started to get some lens to that, that greater comfort with the scary part, the uncertainty. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah, and in clarity with the direction… I can help myself, I'm Ericksonian and so asked, I asked you about your own resources. You're a therapist what kind of intervention do you think might get you where you wanna go? 

00:18:10
FERNANDA MEDINA Well, I have done lots of out of hypnosis, lots. I have also seek uh, help from friends therapists. Especially at the very, very bad moments. And something that helps me a lot is… 

00:18:35
[non-English narration] 

00:18:40
FERNANDA MEDINA Which is… I don't know how to translate that. Something to the future. Where I see myself um, in, in exactly the place where I am, living exactly that what I want feeling the one I want that helps. 

00:18:55
MICHAEL MUNION So you, you really already have that… How do you connect with that? 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:10
FERNANDA MEDINA The problem comes when I say… And what if it doesn't happen. Yeah. So I go from believing that I have the tools to sometimes say, and what if nothing really works? 

00:19:30
MICHAEL MUNION So it's still that uncertainty in that fear? 

00:19:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Mm-hm. 

00:19:35
[sil.] 

00:19:40
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. So you've really already been putting some techniques in the place you've got, um… you've got that vision that, that you worked on if I did not knew, you already work with (inaudible ), you know, she is outstanding and I'm going to follow that at. But so you've got something's you've been working. Um, in terms of your confidence that this is gonna where you wanna go 10 points scale where are you with that? 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:20
FERNANDA MEDINA Seven. 

00:20:20
MICHAEL MUNION Seven. Okay. 

00:20:20
FERNANDA MEDINA It's when I'm scared and when I'm sad that I go down. 

00:20:35
MICHAEL MUNION So what precipitates the scare and the sad? Because that's not everyday, all day is this what I'm hearing, right? What precipitates the scare and the sad? 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:55
FERNANDA MEDINA So many unknown things, like the uncertainty. Uncertainty is one. 

00:21:05
MICHAEL MUNION Absolutely. 

00:21:05
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. I think that one. 

00:21:10
MICHAEL MUNION So right now the uncertainty, you're sitting at home, minding your own business watching the TV, and knock at the door, and uncertainty shows up and say, "Hey." And then you get to go through all this, right? So right now uncertainty is just kind of pushing you around, bullying you really. 

00:21:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Really. 

00:21:35
MICHAEL MUNION So I want you to kind of step back again and maybe even just go ahead and close your eyes and right now, you've got kind of a bully victim relationship with uncertainty. Is that a fair accurate thing to say? 

00:21:50
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:21:55
MICHAEL MUNION What would a healthy relationship with uncertainty look like? 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:05
FERNANDA MEDINA Well, maybe the… 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:15
FERNANDA MEDINA I know that I know… I know that I don't know everything and that I have… I haven't known everything always 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:30
FERNANDA MEDINA But I think it has to do or if being able to learn new things like the part of having lived so much, so much, so many years with my kids, and my husband that's a bit like, it has to do with the long part, like maybe I'm going to stay alone all my life. That's it. 

00:22:55
MICHAEL MUNION So… 

00:22:55
FERNANDA MEDINA Still like. 

00:22:55
MICHAEL MUNION That's kind of that the core of the uncertainty? 

00:23:00
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:23:00
MICHAEL MUNION All right. And, and. And this is more question than anything. 

00:23:10
[sil.] 

00:23:15
MICHAEL MUNION It kind of denies the degree to which that even in your relationship with your children, your spouse, your family before all that, it's paradoxically been you apart from because it's always just been for Fernanda and then there is a part of Fernanda and her family Fernanda, and her kids Fernanda, and, and her, her partner, and her career. And it's that paradoxical thing where we are a part of and apart from all those things that we're engaged with. But isn't it true that you've always been you and then you relating to all these other things. Is that. I mean, don't say that, that's accurate if it's… 

00:24:15
FERNANDA MEDINA No, it is. But I think what I'm more scared of is at the time where the separation happened I also felt disconnected from myself. And I'm scared to go there, to go back there. 

00:24:30
MICHAEL MUNION To, to where you're disconnected to yourself? That, that sounds a little scary. What you think that might be like? 

00:24:40
FERNANDA MEDINA I know how it is like. I like don't want to go back. 

00:24:45
MICHAEL MUNION There is pain there? And grief? 

00:24:55
[sil.] 

00:25:00
MICHAEL MUNION Would it be inaccurate for me to just guess that whenever you put your guard down that's when the grief and pain comes knocking at the door because you're not attending to this or that the other thing, its shows up. 

00:25:20
FERNANDA MEDINA Just sometime it's like, it's there. 

00:25:25
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah. So… There you go. 

00:25:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Thank you. Yeah, I think I want to have a better relationship with that scariness and that uncertainty because now that I'm thinking about it. I still felt alone when I was in that relationship anyway. 

00:25:50
[sil.] 

00:25:55
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah. I, I will put you in this quote, but Robin Williams had a quote and, and it was something to the effect of… The thing that's worse than being alone is being with someone it makes you feel alone. 

00:26:10
FERNANDA MEDINA I know. 

00:26:10
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah. 

00:26:10
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:26:10
MICHAEL MUNION And that's kind of what you're expressing there? As you got felt lonely even when you're in the relationship? 

00:26:15
FERNANDA MEDINA Mm-hm. 

00:26:20
MICHAEL MUNION So I heard you saying maybe the thing that, that's coming up for you. But I think I already say is to, to start to include that feeling of loneliness, sadness, grief, to, to give its room as well. And did you just then come around to kind of defining what that healthier relationship with uncertainty might be like? 

00:26:50
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah, like… 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:27:00
FERNANDA MEDINA Like a balance, I mean, being scared and uncertain but not, not all the time and it's not happening now. But when it happens I kind of forget or disconnect so what I want is to… Even if I'm uncertain and I'm scared to keep connected, 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
FERNANDA MEDINA To, to myself. 

00:27:35
MICHAEL MUNION Which makes a lot of sense to me. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:45
MICHAEL MUNION And what I'm feeling like, how does that relate then when you stay connected to yourself, push through that emotional, that fear that uncertainty, how does that relate to confidence? 

00:28:05
FERNANDA MEDINA I remember the things I can do. I remember what, I keep like feedback from my patients that… I mean, I have like good… Uh, that my work is good. I meet new people and I feel comfortable when I am connected, but when I'm not I kind of I'm afraid to go back to the feeling of complete disconnection. So maybe even if I'm disconnected sometimes but just a little bit not a lot. So like a balance. 

00:28:55
MICHAEL MUNION When I was hearing you talk about connecting my clients, and my experiences, and all those kind of joyful things that life offers. I'm not hearing you say, when I'm insecure I don't meet with my clients, I don't have these… I don't, But the joyfulness is kind of sucked out of it… 

00:29:20
FERNANDA MEDINA When I'm disconnected? 

00:29:20
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah. 

00:29:20
FERNANDA MEDINA Yes. 

00:29:20
MICHAEL MUNION You still doing all the same things, but the appreciation drops way often. And that's, that's a function of the confidence and the uncertainty. Yeah? 

00:29:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. I think… Sorry. That there is also something that has to do with my kids, that I also feel disconnected from them. 

00:29:45
MICHAEL MUNION Because… 

00:29:45
FERNANDA MEDINA I'm that scary. 

00:29:50
MICHAEL MUNION Is that, is that the function of the whole emptiness life transition they're spreading there wings and turn less frequently to mom, in the way that they might have used to… Is that… Don't let me… This is me just looking for clarity again. 

00:30:05
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah, I never thought that when I was 50 all these things were going to happen like at the same time. 

00:30:10
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah. Damn it. 

00:30:10
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah, 51. Okay. Yeah, but it's like all this year like. So I don't see them so often… 

00:30:20
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah, we miss them. 

00:30:25
FERNANDA MEDINA First Christmas without them, yeah, all those things. 

00:30:25
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah, we miss them. Yeah. So finding a way to balance that is as well as it's kind of part of that of the architecture. What do I got to build to, to balance that? And to patiently for the grand kids and all those things that are still coming. 

00:30:50
FERNANDA MEDINA Grand kids? I haven't thinking about that. 

00:30:50
MICHAEL MUNION Our children have a way of going out there and procreating and, you know, changing you to from being a mom to a grandma. Yeah, those things it's entirely possible. 

00:31:05
FERNANDA MEDINA It's kind of guess. Yeah, well, they're still very young my kids, I mean, I hope that doesn't happen soon. 

00:31:10
MICHAEL MUNION Not, not next week for sure. Okay. But old enough to be gone from the nest. 

00:31:20
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. So what I realize now is that when I feel disconnected I stop looking at the future and I disconnect from those possibilities. I felt like my life was going to end this year. 

00:31:35
MICHAEL MUNION So… 

00:31:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Kind of that… 

00:31:35
MICHAEL MUNION That's one more facet of the confidence, its one more facet of the healthy relationship with uncertainty. I don't know what but I do know there are some good things that gonna happen in out there, don't know what they're gonna look like. And, I mean, if I was to say you got to pick now who's the first grandchild gonna be a grandson or granddaughter. It was like how would you possibly know, right? We can't predict all of that we just know there is a future out there. And when we look back, we're seeing an enough lot of good stuff. And just because that it was this major earthquake doesn't mean there isn't mortgage stuff coming. It just scare the bejesus out of us. 

00:32:25
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. Yeah, I guess I was not being able to see that there has been good stuff and there will be good stuff. I was like struck in the middle of the earthquake. 

00:32:35
MICHAEL MUNION So that's one of the benefits of that increased confidence that and, and really flushes out some of that vision of what happens then. All right. So and that kind of takes me back around a question I always wanna ask because when I asked why do we wanna make a change, we got that fear, it's scary, it's not scary, it's very, very, very scary. I made a note. Right? So we don't want it to be very, very, very scary. But once you make that change what are the good things that are gonna happen for your daily experience even when things are unknown. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Well, I will be able to connect with my kids from another um, happier facet of myself… 

00:33:45
MICHAEL MUNION Can you just say, just a little more about that for me? 

00:33:50
FERNANDA MEDINA When I feel more confident and with possibilities I feel that I, that I am also able to connect with them in a different way, with my kids. 

00:34:05
MICHAEL MUNION In a happier way. 

00:34:05
FERNANDA MEDINA In a happier way and that is very important to me. 

00:34:10
MICHAEL MUNION And a thing that's true. They'll never be three, they'll never be in diapers again, you know, right? All those things. So different but good. 

00:34:25
FERNANDA MEDINA Good. I mean, when I say different, I mean good. 

00:34:25
MICHAEL MUNION Yeah. And… 

00:34:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Because when the separation was happening and all that it's not so good. 

00:34:30
MICHAEL MUNION Right. 

00:34:35
FERNANDA MEDINA And sometimes… Even I didn't want to involve, I mean, they got involved. So… 

00:34:40
MICHAEL MUNION So… 

00:34:40
FERNANDA MEDINA Good, better. 

00:34:45
MICHAEL MUNION So one of those good things that's gonna happen when you have a different relationship with uncertainty is where, you know, we're gonna connect differently and more happily with the kids, and I'm saying this is a question again less missing how it was making room to appreciate how it's becoming. 

00:35:05
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:35:05
MICHAEL MUNION Is that accurate? 

00:35:05
FERNANDA MEDINA Mm-hm. 

00:35:10
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. Good. I don't want to put words in your mouth that aren't but. Okay. So what are the good things that are gonna happen when you have this different relationship with uncertainty? 

00:35:20
FERNANDA MEDINA I will travel a lot. 

00:35:20
MICHAEL MUNION Travel a lot. 

00:35:25
FERNANDA MEDINA A lot more. Yeah. 

00:35:30
MICHAEL MUNION Tell me about traveling and… I mean, you're saying that's a good thing… 

00:35:35
FERNANDA MEDINA That how it feels to me. 

00:35:35
MICHAEL MUNION What do you like about traveling? 

00:35:40
FERNANDA MEDINA You meet people, different cultures, and I have traveled since I was a kid to different countries. And my father used to say that he was a citizen of the world. So that's how I feel. 

00:35:55
MICHAEL MUNION And you like connecting up with kind of being like dad and… 

00:36:00
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah, I like dad very much. 

00:36:00
MICHAEL MUNION Nice. 

00:36:05
FERNANDA MEDINA And English gets better. 

00:36:05
MICHAEL MUNION Yes. And what? 

00:36:05
FERNANDA MEDINA My English… 

00:36:10
MICHAEL MUNION That was a joke. 

00:36:10
FERNANDA MEDINA Thank you. 

00:36:15
MICHAEL MUNION A bad joke. Sorry. 

00:36:15
FERNANDA MEDINA I'm going to try your Spanish. 

00:36:20
MICHAEL MUNION I see. Yeah, see. That's about it. So what other good things can you, can you envision when you have this different healthier relationship with uncertainty? 

00:36:35
FERNANDA MEDINA That instead of seeing a thing like being more in black and white, I see more colors. And that was the case when I… After being very disconnected in that situation one day I started looking at the green of the trees and I was like, "Oh, there is green and there is other color." So that too. 

00:37:05
MICHAEL MUNION Nice. Sweet. So I'm gonna ask you again to just kind of take a nice deep breath and it's… I may stubble with little bit of this articulation and you're gonna help to get it right. But all things that you're describing in terms of this healthy relationship with uncertainty that sense of confidence, right, that sense of connectedness that more vivid colorful life that feeling that is there a moment in your past when you can recall that, that kind of experience? 

00:38:05
FERNANDA MEDINA The nice experience? 

00:38:10
MICHAEL MUNION That, that, that essentially when you were, you know, and it may… I told you, I was gonna struggle with the articulation of the question because it may that the context for that feeling comfortable and confidence. And, you know, not unconcerned about what the particulars were gonna be just knowing as you do that it's been good, there're some ups and downs, there's an earthquake now and then, and it's still gonna be good that may have happened in a context when your kids were little and your relationship was there and felt solid, but it was really your experience not those facets of your life that, that cause that, do you have that experience? So tell me a little bit about that, that recollection that experience. And I want you to really let yourself immerse yourself in that experience. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Well, I'm seeing myself like living in different places, 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:45
FERNANDA MEDINA Studying, and working, and also like having challenges, but in those other challenges there was always a sense of continuity 

00:40:00
[sil.] 

00:40:05
FERNANDA MEDINA And that's what I felt was missing but I'm feeling that at the moment. That life did not end. 

00:40:10
MICHAEL MUNION Life did not end. All right. And so… 

00:40:15
FERNANDA MEDINA And it's and I will be okay. I mean, there will be nice things happening. 

00:40:20
MICHAEL MUNION And in that moment in that experience that you're connected to this moment there is certainty even in the face of uncertainty, it's a paradox. It is the uncertainty it has not disappeared, it's just your certainty that I will prevail. Yeah? And you're connected to that? So I'm asking you now is there a way that you can see yourself connecting with this feeling, right here, right now whenever you choose? 

00:41:05
FERNANDA MEDINA I'm feeling connected to that feeling at the moment. 

00:41:10
MICHAEL MUNION How did you get there? Because I might have ask questions but you got there. 

00:41:25
FERNANDA MEDINA It has something to do with the uncertainty, uncertainty and like accepting both… 

00:41:35
MICHAEL MUNION But you reach back into your personal experience where you've had that, right? Was there any event when you can recall feeling that courageous, strong, undaunted? 

00:41:50
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:41:50
MICHAEL MUNION What's that experience? 

00:41:55
[sil.] 

00:42:00
FERNANDA MEDINA I had a business once in and I lost it, and it was some major event in my life. And it was very different because there were lawyers involved because I had brought a franchise, 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:25
FERNANDA MEDINA But the lady that sold me this franchise committed a fraud to me. So there were lawyers involved and I, I didn't even had met with lawyers before in my life. So I just saw them in movies. 

00:42:40
MICHAEL MUNION You thought they're normal reasonable people? 

00:42:40
FERNANDA MEDINA No, I thought they were, they existed just in movies. So at that moment I felt like it was the people versus Fernanda or something like that… Like I really saw the movies and I was… 

00:42:55
MICHAEL MUNION Me against the world. 

00:43:00
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah, something. And even it was a very difficult experience and I was scared to death because lawyers and that's not a good experience. I came out of that experience good and with more knowledge and with… I'm still here, and I was still happy, and I studied another master degree and then I became a better therapist. So… 

00:43:35
MICHAEL MUNION So that, that moment, that time you can access that memory and you feel. I almost want to say word of triumph or mastery… 

00:43:50
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. 

00:43:50
MICHAEL MUNION Mastery. So close your eyes connect with that feeling mastery. 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:10
MICHAEL MUNION And feel it beyond the academic the intellectual feeling in your gut. Feel it in your emotions. Do you get that? 

00:44:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. Most of the master of life then, the master of other things. 

00:44:40
MICHAEL MUNION And you're able to get that state once we decided where in about a minute and a half, right. Just take a deep breath and let yourself reconnect with something that you've already experienced previously in your life, right. Now we talked about an array of interventions and you can come back out here now. It's nice in there but we talked about an array of interventions and what I want to recommend is your intervention is that every morning, for the next six weeks, you spend five minutes back in that place where you have that mastery. 

00:45:30
FERNANDA MEDINA Mm-hm. 

00:45:30
MICHAEL MUNION Is that something you could do? Is that something you will do? So just letting yourself be there with that, right? And I asked you about your confidence level of where do you think, you know, when you got about a seven, so you're already really had some good interventions you felt good about putting this in there along side all of that, where is your confidence level that you're gonna have a healthy relationship with uncertainty? 

00:46:05
FERNANDA MEDINA Eleven. 

00:46:10
MICHAEL MUNION Eleven on a ten point scale. 

00:46:10
FERNANDA MEDINA At 10. 

00:46:15
MICHAEL MUNION So they count differently in Mexico… 

00:46:15
FERNANDA MEDINA Yes, we do. 

00:46:15
MICHAEL MUNION Ten. Okay. All right. So that something that you can do and you'll do for the next six weeks or so. I mean, and you can do it forever if you want, but I like the idea of getting ourselves a costumed to a certain way of being. 

00:46:35
FERNANDA MEDINA Yeah. I will. 

00:46:40
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. And it's not that you can't go back there whenever life conspires to, you know, give you little bumps in the road but I think if you do it routinely not in the scary situation, just in this is who I am and how I am. All right. Great. So do you have comments or questions for me? 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:15
MICHAEL MUNION Okay. And I have some comments I wanna make about what I was aiming at and the title of… Well, usually I can't quote the title but… 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN Enhance brief outcomes. 

00:47:25
MICHAEL MUNION Enhancing the brief outcomes. There was two places I wanted to go and so if I was to kind of rewind and say here is what we did. I ask in a ray of questions. One of which is, why did we wanna make change? Right? And I wanted to know what the vision was, right, of success. And, and the first round of why do we wanna make the change was because it's very, very, very scary. Okay. So what I'm promoting is for us to be attentive to, what is the motivation for change? Because what I will tell you is that what presented itself to me after enough years of therapy and it sound so simple and stupid when you just end up saying it loud, is that people are motivated, motivated by fear and what they want to avoid are seldom at successful as people who have something that they drawn to, right? The people who come to for weight loss and say, you know, I wanna loose this wait. Why do you want to do that? Because I might have heart attack or, you know… But the once who say I always wanted to hike the Grand Canyon or I'm taking my grand kids to the Disneyland… They have something positive that they're reaching for. So when we went back around we identified connecting differently with the kids in a positive way to travel more and be the citizen of the world and to feel like seeing more colors. All right. Those are love-based uh, positive motivations for change. Does this make sense to y'all? So, so I just wanted to access what Fernanda was coming with, in terms of her motivation for change and, you know, honestly I think more of our clients walk in door with a negative and fear-based motivation for change. Something they want to stop, something they want to go away or get away from. If we can then actively connect them up with what are the positive things, right? You know, and so when, when someone comes and says they quit smoking and I say, "Why?" "Because it's gonna kill me." And all this fear-based stuff, it's pretty easy to say well, how much is that cost in these days and it's not a cheap thing, it was, you know, almost two bucks when I quit 25 years ago. I think it's a lot for pack, right. What can you do with all that money? I can that baseboard I always wanted, right? Now we've got something that they're moving towards instead of something we're moving away from. Does this make sense? So that's, that was one of the things I did. The other is, you know, when we want to create that change, we've got some clarity on what that is and it took a while to come to when having different relationship with uncertainty, once we got some real clarity on what that out come looks like, I wanted to go inside and connect with when did I experience that before. Whatever it is that our clients are wanting in terms of the desired outcome to desired state if they've experienced something like that let's take advantage of that, let's leverage that utilize, probably good word, proxy. Let's utilize that experience and get them connected on a routine day to day basis. Is that make sense to you all? Okay. 

00:51:25
FERNANDA MEDINA Excuse me. So that's why you ask me to tell the experience. I mean, because you asked me to say it out loud? 

00:51:35
MICHAEL MUNION Well, I wanted to know that you had a way to evoke that for yourself on a routine basis. All right. And sometimes people, you know, I've this kind of thing and I was watching Jeff do a demo and this, this lady ended up doing a dance. But that evoked the sense that she was looking for to evoke the state that she was looking for. It can be poetry, it can be music, it can… You know, and it varies from person to person this is a collaborative process, it would not be nearly so effective if I said. Well, here is what I want you to do, start doing right. But once you connected up with, this is when I had that sense of mastery, I just came through the war, and I'm the warrior princes, and kick butt, and let's go get another degree, and right? 

00:52:25
FERNANDA MEDINA Right. 

00:52:25
MICHAEL MUNION So that's what you wanted to evoke on a routine basis. And that's, that's the uh, healthy relationship with uncertainty. Of course, we don't know what's gonna happen that would be so boring, right? But, but to be comfortable with that, that uncertainty, right, which was, what was pounding on your door at unpredictable hours and making you miserable, yeah? So this is what we ever aiming at. Did you have another question or… Are there other questions here? Hearing none, I wanna say thank you to all of you. And enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you. 

00:53:10
FERNANDA MEDINA Thank you. Okay.
