ARTHUR JONGSMA Hello and welcome. I’m are Arthur Jongsma and joining me is my colleague Dr. Tim Bruce. Today we’re going to discuss evidence-based treatment planning for eating disorders and obesity. 

00:00:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE This program is broken into a number of modules. In it, we’ll describe the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders and obesity. Discuss the essential elements of the treatment planning process. Provide a brief history of the movement to identify empirically supported treatments or ESTs, as well as other sources of evidence-based practices and practice guidelines. We’ll then show how to empirically inform a treatment plan with findings from this literature. And lastly, we’ll present an example of a completed evidence-based treatment plan. 

00:01:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Before we get started, one thing should be noted. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a treatment plan for eating disorders or obesity can be empirically informed. We will incorporate goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with those of identified ESTs and with evidence-based practice guidelines. You’ll also see brief therapy scenarios that demonstrate aspects of the EST interventions described. 

00:02:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE It’s important to note that these scenarios are selected examples of ESTs and don’t represent delivery of any one of them in their entirety. Our program is designed to be educational in nature and is not intended to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about any of these therapies, references to their empirical support, clinical resources, and training opportunities can be found in the Companion Workbook. 

00:02:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Let’s begin by looking at the diagnostic criteria or clinical features for eating disorders and obesity. Eating disorders are characterized by clinically significant disturbances in eating behavior. There are two major eating disorders recognized in the DSM, Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa. The essential feature of anorexia nervosa is a refusal to maintain a minimally normal body weight. Bulimia Nervosa is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating as well as problematic compensatory behaviors aimed at preventing weight gain. Bingeing is defined as the uncontrolled consumption of abnormally large amounts of food in a discrete period of time. Examples of compensatory behaviors aimed at preventing weight gain include, purging the body of the food through self induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications. Fasting and excessive exercise are examples of non purging compensatory behaviors. 

00:03:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Long recognized by patients, clinicians, and researchers as a clinically significant eating problem, binge eating disorder or BED was not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM IV. It has been proposed as one for the next edition of the manual. However, BED is characterized by frequent episodes of binge eating. But unlike bulimia nervosa, BED is not associated with the compensatory behaviors aimed at preventing weight gain. Consequently, most individuals with BED are overweight, suffer negative emotional consequences due to the uncontrolled behavior and engage in ongoing attempts to diet. 

00:04:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Because it predisposes individuals to an increased risk of several diseases and medical conditions, obesity is included in the ICD as a general medical condition. It does not appear in the DSM has an eating disorder because it’s not consistently associated with a psychological or behavioral syndrome. It is however, a highly prevalent medical issue influenced by psychological and behavioral factors. And it has proven to be responsive to psychological treatment. So we are including it in our discussion of eating disorders, although technically speaking it’s not an eating disorder. 

00:05:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE So let’s take a closer look at each of these conditions. Those with anorexia nervosa or simply anorexia refused to maintain a minimally normal body weight which is defined diagnostically as less than 85% of normal expected weight. Even though underweight, they have an intense fear of gaining it or becoming what they see as fat. Most heavy distorted perception of their body shape seeing it as bigger, heavier, “fatter than it is.” Many also overvalue body weight and shape in their self-concept or deny the seriousness of their low body weight. Females with anorexia suffer a amenorrhea due to weight loss which is defined diagnostically and is having this three consecutive menstrual cycles. 

00:05:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Some clients with anorexia will engage in binge-eating and purging, while others do not. These two subtypes are to be specified when making the diagnosis by indicating whether it is binge-eating purging type or the restricting type. 

00:06:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Anorexia occurs in approximately 0.5% of the United States population or approximately 1.5 million individuals, more than 90% of these are female. The average age of onset is mid-to-late adolescence. The course of anorexia is variable with some individuals fully recovering after one episode and others experiencing repeated relapses. Initial hospitalization may be required to restore weight and correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances. In hospitals where it’s been studied long-term mortality from anorexia nervosa is estimated at around 10%. The most common causes of death are starvation, suicide, and electrolyte imbalance. It is well-known that anorexia nervosa can have serious medical consequences and requires prompt and conscientious care. 

00:07:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA The first essential feature of bulimia nervosa or bulimia is binge eating a large amount of food in which there is a sense of lack of control over BED. Secondly, believe me is characterized by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain. For diagnostic purposes, the episodes of binge eating and compensatory behavior should occur on average at least twice a week for three months. As with anorexia the bulimia suffers self-evaluation is unreasonably influenced by his or her perceived body shape and weight. Finally, because bingeing and purging can occur within anorexia nervosa. It’s important to rule out that these behaviors are not occurring within the context of that disorder where body weight is severely compromised and menstrual periods have ceased. 

00:08:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE The DSM as a diagnostician to distinguish between two subtypes of bulimia, the purging type and the non purging type. As we’ve said the purging subtype would indicate the use of self induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas or other medications to rid the body of food. Non purging compensatory behaviors include fasting and excessive exercise. 

00:08:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Bulimia occurs in approximately 1% to 3% of the US population. And as with anorexia, approximately 90% of sufferers are female. The average age of onset is late adolescence to early adulthood. But it has been known to onset in children as young as nine as well as in adulthood. The course of bulimia may be chronic or intermittent with periods of remission and recurrences. Periods of remission longer than one year have been associated with a better long-term outcome. 

00:08:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE As we noted binge-eating disorder is currently not a specific diagnosis in the DSM. The following are the proposed criteria for the diagnosis and reflect its long recognized clinical features. 

00:09:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA As the name implies, BED is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating. Binge eating episodes are often characterized by eating more quickly than usual, eating until uncomfortably full or eating large amounts of food when not physically hungry. Those with BED often eat alone out of embarrassment. And they often feel disgusted, depressed, or guilty after a binge eating episode. BED causes marked distress in the individual and for diagnostic purposes should occur on average at least weekly for three months or more. 

00:09:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Unlike bulimia, binge eating disorder is not associated with attempts to counteract the effects of binge-eating such as purging. Consequently, most individuals with this disorder are overweight and engage in ongoing attempts to diet. 

00:10:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA A recent large study reported that approximately 3.5% of women and 2% of men reported having BED at some point in their lives. This makes the disorder more prevalent than anorexia or bulimia. BED typically onsets in late adolescence to early adulthood but has been reported to onset earlier or later in some individuals. 

00:10:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Obesity is defined as an excess of body weight relative to height. It is attributed to an abnormally high proportion of body fat. A common metric used to calculate the presence and degree of obesity is the body mass index or BMI. For adults a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is classified as overweight, a BMI over 30 constitutes obesity or there is no scientifically accepted definition of obesity in children and adolescents. Pediatric overweight is typically defined as a BMI for age, meeting or exceeding the 95th percentile and 85th percentile marks the point at which a child or adolescent is considered at risk for being overweight. 

00:11:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Overweight and obesity are established risk factors for a number of medical complications and diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary artery disease. Obesity is not an eating disorder per se but rather a medical condition. But it’s strongly influenced by psychological and behavioral factors and has been shown to be responsive to psychological treatment. 

00:11:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Using the BMI definition for obesity, The Center for Disease Control estimates the prevalence and gender distribution of obesity in the United States as 32% of adult men and 35% of adult women. The obesity rate in children ages 2 to 19 is estimated to be approximately 17%, a rate that has grown significantly over the past three decades. There are six essential steps in developing a psychotherapy treatment plan. Each is customized to the individual client’s unique presentation. These steps are, identify the clients primary and secondary problems, described behavioral definitions of the problem. That is each problem’s behavioral, cognitive, emotional, physiological, and interpersonal expression, or symptom manifestations. Make a diagnosis based on DSM or ICD criteria. Specify the long-term goals of the treatment. Create short-term objectives for the client and select therapeutic interventions. 

00:12:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA A client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment but as a first step in creating a treatment plan, the clinician must determine the most significant problem or problems. This is often done by assessing which are the most related to current, distress, disability or both. Usually, a primary problem will surface and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few identified problems or treatment will lose its direction. 

00:13:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave, or interact will be to some degree unique to them and their situation. So each problem that it’s selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how it’s evidenced in your particular client. Therefore, as a second step in the treatment planning process, the behavioral definition to the problem are specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria such as those found in the DSM or ICD, which should be kept in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. 

00:14:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA The third step in treatment planning, the determination of an appropriate diagnosis is based on an evaluation of the clients complete clinical presentation. The clinician must compare the behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal features causing distress or disability to the DSM or ICD criteria. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnoses per se in formulating their treatment plans, but instead prefer to focus on changes in the identified problem behavior, cognition, emotions and the like. Having said that, most third party payers require a diagnosis and most ESTs are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems. So it is usually necessary to make a diagnosis. 

00:14:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Step four and developing a treatment plan is to set long-term goals for the resolution of the client’s primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted measurable terms but can be broader and indicated desired general positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. 

00:15:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Writing short-term objectives for the client to achieve is step five in developing a treatment plan. In contrast to long-term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measurable or observable terms. Clearly stated objectives are helpful to both the therapist and client in assessing progress. They are also important to quality assurance review agencies, HMOs and managed care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objective should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. 

00:15:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Interventions or the action of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives, selecting the appropriate therapist interventions at the sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least one intervention planned for every client objective. If the client does not accomplish the objective after the initial interventions have been implemented, new interventions or reassessment of the problem should be considered in the plan. 

00:16:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA From what we have just described, it may sound like this is a pretty cut and dried process that you just simply repeat it with every client, but that’s really not the case. One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client’s unique problems, strengths, and needs. Treatment plans should not be boilerplate even if clients have similar problems. The individual strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, cultural and social network, family circumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing a treatment strategy. Clinicians should rely on their own good clinical judgment and select interventions that are appropriate for the individual client. It can conceivably be argued that the movement toward evidence-based psychological treatment planning began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, but the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in the early 1990s in Great Britain and then in the United States. 

00:17:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE On the forefront of the movement in the United States was Division 12 of the American Psychological Association, The Society of Clinical Psychology. In 1993, Division 12 organized a task force chaired by Dr. Diane (inaudible) and charged with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature to identify psychological treatments whose efficacy had been demonstrated through clinical research. 

00:18:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA The group established criteria for judging the quantity and quality of the research supporting a particular treatment and categorize treatments meeting these criteria as well-established or probably efficacious. Both sets of criteria require replicated demonstrations of efficacy through high-quality trials or case series. The well-established category requires independent replication as well as other features, the details of which can be found in the workbook. 

00:18:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE By 1996, the group had identified a preliminary list of 25 ESTs meeting their criteria. By 1998, the list had grown to 71 ESTs. In 1999 Division 12 took over full ownership of maintaining the growing list. The current list and information about the treatments can be found on its website. 

00:19:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Since the work of this original group, other reviewers using the same or similar criteria have initiated or updated literature reviews. Their conclusions relate to a variety of populations, problems and interventions. On your screen are a few recent examples. You can find more of them in the Companion Workbook. 

00:19:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Descriptions of the treatments identified through many of the reviews as well as references to their empirical support, clinical resources, and training opportunities can be found at therapyadvisor.com. This resource was developed by personal improvement computer systems with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health and in consultation with members of the original Division 12 task groups. 

00:19:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA As we mentioned Great Britain was on the forefront of these efforts to identify ESTs. The latest products of their work can be found at the website for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence or NICE. The website includes practical and specific guidelines for the treatment of various medical and mental health problems. 

00:20:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration or SAMHSA also has an initiative to evaluate identify and provide information on evidence-based mental health practices. Their summaries entitled the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices or NREPP. 

00:20:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has established guidelines and criteria for identifying evidence-based practices and provides links to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for various medical and mental health problems. Their work is summarized on their website. 

00:20:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Lastly, The Cochrane Collaboration is an international network of professionals who conduct systematic reviews of research in healthcare. Among their products are critical reviews of psychological treatment interventions and specific intervention questions. 

00:21:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA In this series we draw from all these sources in our discussion of how clinicians can create evidence-based treatment plans. 

00:21:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Creating an evidence-based treatment plan as described in this series involves integrating the principal elements of identified ESTs into each step of the treatment planning process discussed previously. Let’s now look at efforts to develop and identify ESTs and evidence-based treatment guidelines for eating disorders and obesity. There have been several independent reviews of the psychotherapy outcome literature for the treatment of eating disorders and obesity. There have identified either empirically supported treatments or support evidence-based practice guidelines. Examples include APA’s Division 12, The Society of Clinical Psychology and Division 53, The Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, as well as Wilson and Fairburn in Nathan and Gorman series, “A Guide to Treatments that Work.” Other organizational reviews have been conducted by the agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in the United States and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence or NICE in Great Britain, as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics for example. 

00:22:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Because treatment outcome research into specific eating disorders has advanced at different paces. We will discuss each individually beginning with anorexia nervosa or AN for short. So, Tim, despite the clinical significance of anorexia, the psychotherapy outcome literature and practice guidelines based upon it have only recently begun to see the type of high-quality controlled studies needed to support evidence-based recommendations. 

00:22:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE That’s true. You know, only recently has a form of family therapy referred to as the Maudsley model, demonstrated efficacy and high-quality studies of both short and long-term outcomes. And this advance in the literature which is recent has been recognized by several reviewers of this literature. 

00:23:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Such as Divisions 12 and 53 of APA, they’ve recognized family therapy based on the Maudsley model as well established. 

00:23:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE That’s true. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also endorsed this form of family therapy as the outpatient treatment of choice for anorexia nervosa. 

00:23:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Let’s take a look at what this therapy involves. Family-based treatment or FBT for anorexia nervosa is an outpatient intervention for adolescence. It is designed to restore and maintain weight without hospitalization. Of course, patients who are medically unstable or hospitalized initially prior to being discharged FBT. FBT is conceptualized in three phases conducted in approximately 20 sessions over one year. Although, the length of treatment may vary either way depending on clinical progress. 

00:24:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE In the first phase of FBT, the seriousness of the disorder is conveyed. Parents are placed in charge of the nutritional rehabilitation and weight restoration of their adolescent child. The family eats some meals in therapy while the therapist assesses interactions and provides guidance and opportunity for parental success in re-feeding the patient. The adolescent’s autonomy and other life areas such as school and social domains are kept intact with appropriate supervision consistent with the patient’s stage of development. 

00:24:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA In the second phase of treatment, control over eating is shifted to the adolescent. Criteria for determining this shift will include the weight of the patient, which needs to be at least 87% of ideal. The adolescent also needs to show evidence of eating without undue prompting or struggle with the parents. Parents should feel empowered through the re-feeding process. And the patient should feel relief that he or she can manage it from here forward. 

00:25:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Once eating and weight disturbances and other symptomatic behavior are convincingly under control. Phase three begins. In this phase the family is prepared for termination. Issues of importance to the patient are addressed. The family has taught how to use problem-solving to address difficulties, planning for possible future issues is reviewed, and the family is taught how to use skills learned in the therapy to address them, should they arise. 

00:25:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA As Division12 notes, FBT views the parents of adolescents with AN as a resource for resolving the problem. It corrects miss appraisals of blame directed to the parents and the ill adolescent. Siblings are guided to play a supportive role in treatment but are assigned no job role in the re-feeding process. The focus of FBT is not on presumed causes for the anorexia nervosa, but rather on how the family can use its strengths to reverse unhealthy and maintain healthy beliefs and practices around eating, weight, and health. 

00:26:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Although FBT has shown efficacy in the short and long-term treatment of anorexia nervosa. Reviewers have commented that it’s mechanisms of action remain unclear. The call for further study of these mechanisms has been sounded. 

00:26:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Tim, while FBT has emerged as an evidence-based treatment for adolescents with anorexia, there is a clear need to develop effective treatments for older adolescents and adults with the disorder, right? 

00:26:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, outcome studies to date have yielded only modest results and often have high dropout rates. Today while most reviewers of this literature acknowledged the need for further study. A few such as APA’s Division 12 have noted that cognitive behavioral therapy has received preliminary cert for treating anorexia when it’s used in a particular manner. 

00:27:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA They currently judge it as probably efficacious. Let’s take a brief look at this therapy, Tim. 

00:27:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Okay, CBT for anorexia nervosa is intended for late adolescents and adults as a post hospitalization. Outpatient intervention designed to prevent relapse once the patient has gained sufficient weight in the context of inpatient treatment. And this is in part because it has shown only mixed results as an intervention for restoring weight. This treatment is typically conducted as an individual therapy over the course of one year. The therapy begins with biweekly sessions and moves to a weekly schedule once healthy weight is stable. 

00:27:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Behavioral strategies used in this therapy may include establishing a regular pattern of eating and systematic exposure to what the patient has seen as forbidden foods. 

00:28:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:28:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA While simultaneously addressing motivational factors and cognitive biases related to the patient’s appraisal of shape and weight. 

00:28:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:28:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Cognitive interventions typically target change in deeper belief systems that support the strong tie between personal identity and the illness. 

00:28:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE That’s true. 

00:28:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA So while FBT has recently emerged as a well-established treatment for adolescents with anorexia, the work to establish similarly efficacious treatment for adults is continuing. 

00:28:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it does. 

00:28:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA In contrast to the comparatively small evidence-based for treatment of anorexia nervosa, several well-designed treatment outcome studies support the evidence base for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. 

00:28:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE That’s true. 

00:28:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA And reviewers have been highly uniform in the conclusions they have drawn from it regarding evidence-based psychological treatments. What are the research supported treatments for bulimia, Tim? 

00:29:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, APA’s Division 12 has identified two treatments as well established and one as probably efficacious for the treatment of bulimia. The two well-established treatments are Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT and Interpersonal Therapy or IPT. Family-based treatment adapted from the model we’ve just been discussing for anorexia nervosa has also shown promise in initial studies and is currently judge probably efficacious for bulimia by Division 12. Several other reviewers such as the AHRQ, NICE in Great Britain, the Cochrane Reviews and Wilson and Fairburn in Nathan and Gorman’s series have come to the same conclusion, but point out that the effects of IPT may take longer to emerge relative to CBT. 

00:29:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Okay. Let’s talk about the CBT approach to bulimia treatment. What is the prime focus of this approach? 

00:30:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, CBT for bulimia directly targets the core features of the disorder namely the binge eating, the unhealthy compensatory behaviors such as purging and the excessive concern with body shape and weight. The treatment focuses on how these features operate in the present to maintain bulimia as opposed to why they originally developed. 

00:30:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA I understand CBT for bulimia is administered in three phases. Can you elaborate on that for us, Tim? 

00:30:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Sure. The first phase involves psychoeducation regarding weight and the adverse physiological effects of binge-eating, purging, extreme dieting, and the like. It encourages the patient to establish a regular pattern of eating and an appropriate weight monitoring schedule such as weekly instead of multiple times daily. Stimulus control procedures such as eliminating binge foods from the house, confining eating to a specific time or place, not shopping for food when especially hungry, those kinds of things are typically employed. Self-control strategies such as replacing bingeing with alternative pleasurable and feasible activities such as taking a walk, seeing a friend, listening to music, those things are explained and implement that, this is all first phase. So in the second phase of the treatment, the focus shifts to eliminating dieting, reducing shape and weight concerns through cognitive restructuring and learning problem-solving to manage stresses as opposed to using bingeing to manage them. 

00:31:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA And the third phase… 

00:31:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it’s devoted to developing a maintenance plan and to the prevention of relapse using a common considerations for relapse prevention. 

00:31:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Let me summarize this by saying that in CBT the therapist works collaborative with the patient to break the cycle of bingeing and purging and to develop more adaptive ways of thinking and behaving in nd relation to eating, weight, body shape and health. 

00:32:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Exactly. 

00:32:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Now, how about interpersonal therapy for bulimia? What is the focus of this approach? 

00:32:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, Inter Personal Therapy or IPT for bulimia is based on the treatment that was originally developed and subsequently shown to be efficacious for the treatment of depression. So in IPT the focus of therapy is on resolving interpersonal difficulties in the patient’s life, as opposed to directly treating the eating disorder explicitly. The relationship between interpersonal problems and the eating disorder is identified during the initial phase of treatment but it’s only implied thereafter. 

00:32:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA IPT has been described in three-phases too. Can we briefly review those? 

00:32:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Sure, the first phase is devoted to thoroughly assessing eating disorder as well as significant past and present interpersonal relationships. They call this taking the interpersonal inventory. The therapist leads this question and answer back and forth assessment phase. 

00:32:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Although interpersonal precipitants of current binge eating episodes are identified, it is the interpersonal issues that are targeted rather than the binge-eating. 

00:33:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, exactly. A specific interpersonal problem or problems that will become the focus of the second phase of treatment are agreed upon in the first phase. 

00:33:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA I understand that the common themes in this second phase include things like role disputes, role transitions, interpersonal deficits, and unresolved grief. How are these addressed? 

00:33:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, in the second phase of treatment the role shift, as the therapist ask the patient to take the lead by discussing and being willing to explore change in the interpersonal problem areas identified in phase one. So IPT therapists lean on techniques more traditionally associated with non-directive therapies to help you know, help the client clarify issues that they’re raising and, and discuss possible changes that could be made. They also keep the patient focused on the problem and encouraged the client’s willingness to change. They may also use technique traditionally associated with some behavioral therapy such as role plays or problem-solving when dealing with how a particular interpersonal conflict might be addressed or accomplished by the patient. 

00:34:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA The third phase of this treatment typically emphasizes maintaining gains and preventing relapse, right? 

00:34:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, it does. 

00:34:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA In what modality and for how long is this therapy usually conducted? 

00:34:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE IPT is usually conducted as an individual therapy but it can be done in group. It usually runs for approximately 20 weekly sessions. 

00:34:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Tim, let’s turn our attention for a minute to BED. The treatment outcome literature and practice guidelines regarding the evidence-based treatment of binge-eating disorder is very similar to that of bulimia nervosa, correct? 

00:34:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, for example Division 12 is identified CBT and IPT as the only two treatments for binge eating disorder. They have an evidence-based sufficient to meet their criteria for well-established treatments. Reviewers using less stringent criteria for example involving high-quality trials but not requiring independent replication like Division 12 does. They’ve noted that other treatments such as behavioral weight-loss programs and guided self-help using CBT principles have also shown efficacy for BED. However, these reviewers note that this efficacy has been shown only in short-term trials. So far that is. So CBT and IPT are the only treatments that have demonstrated replicated efficacy for BED in both short and long-term trials. 

00:35:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Okay. Now our last identified eating problem is obesity. Although not an eating disorder per se. Overweight and obesity are significant medical and psychological issues in part because they are influenced by cognitive behavioral and social features that are established risk factors for a number of medical complications and diseases including diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, and sleep apnea. 

00:36:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, that’s exactly right. Many professional medical organizations have evidence-based practice guidelines for assessing and treating obesity, including like family medicine and pediatrics and all emphasize the importance of multicomponent interventions focused on changes in lifestyle diet and exercise. 

00:36:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA What about the evidence-based practice guidelines we’ve mentioned? What are they saying about the treatment of obesity? 

00:36:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, it’s a similar message. For example the guidelines from NICE in Great Britain state that these multi-component interventions are the treatment of choice for overweight and obesity. They recommend that weight management programs include behavior change strategies to increase people’s physical activity levels as well as improving eating behavior and the quality of the person’s diet. So examples of recommended behavior change strategies are those well-known to behavioral medicine and include self-monitoring of behavior and progress, stimulus control procedures such as setting regular meal times and removing access to, you know, high calorie junk foods in the like, as well as more traditional cognitive behavioral objectives such as learning how to problem-solve, learning assertiveness skills, practicing cognitive restructuring, ensuring social support and of course learning relapse prevention strategies. 

00:37:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA And how about APA’s Division 12, have they identified any ESTs for obesity? 

00:37:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE They have. Division 12 has identified behavioral weight loss treatment or BWL for obesity as the only type of intervention for obesity that has met their criteria for a well-established treatment. They note that BWL is a short-term treatment that uses many of the interventions we just mentioned to achieve acute weight reduction and establish new behavioral patterns aimed at, you know, maintaining the weight loss. 

00:38:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:38:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE They cite the learned model as, you know, an exemplar of this type of approach. 

00:38:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. I’m familiar with the LEARN Program. It’s the behavior or weight loss treatment developed by Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell. LEARN is an acronym that reflects the multi-component emphasis of this well-studied version of BWL. It stands for lifestyle, exercise, attitudes, relationships, and nutrition. The program promotes changes in these multiple domains designed to synergistically yield weight-loss. How’s the program delivered, Tim? 

00:38:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, LEARN can be conceptualized and is often delivered as a series of lessons that break down its five major themes reflected in the acronym. It encourages setting reasonable expectations and weight goals. It teaches healthy nutrition. It prescribes variety in food choices. No food is completely forbidden, but rather moderation and consumption is emphasized. It encourages small changes in daily lifestyle activity. And they teach cognitive restructuring and behavioral skills such as those we’ve mentioned like communication, problem-solving, relapse prevention skills. Outcome studies of BWL programs have reported short-term weight loss or BMI for age percentile reduction in adults and children respectively. While children have typically maintain their weight loss following BWLs. Adult show evidence of continuing to struggle with weight regain and this is consistent with results from other weight loss interventions for the adult population. 

00:39:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA We begin building our treatment plan for eating disorders and obesity by selecting behavioral definition statements that describe the symptom pattern of our specific client. The list on your screen starts with eight statements that characterize anorexia nervosa, such as refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height and recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain such as self induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise. Some of the first statements could also apply to a client struggling with Bulimia Nervosa such as undue influence of body weight or shape on self evaluation. But statements eight and nine, recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors and recurrent episodes of binge eating are most clearly associated with bulimia. 

00:40:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Statements 10 through 14 are descriptive of binge eating disorder, including eating rapidly in large amounts and feeling bad emotionally following the binge. 

00:41:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Finally, statement 15 is classically associated with obesity but several of the previous statements may be applicable to an obese client as well, such as those that describe binge eating disorder that Tim just reviewed. 

00:41:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Now let’s turn our attention to the long-term goals section of our treatment plan. These statements describe in general terms the desired endpoint of treatment. For our client with anorexia we might select a statement like restore normal eating patterns, healthy weight, and a realistic appraisal of body size. And for our client with obesity issues, we might select, terminate over eating and implement lifestyle changes that lead to weight loss and improved health. Other statements could apply to bulimia and new ones could be added based on what you and your client went to accomplish. 

00:42:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Next, we focus on the assessment phase of treatment for eating disorders and obesity. Examples of objectives and interventions for this part of our treatment plan describe the process of gathering information from the client and in some cases the parents of a client that will determine a diagnosis and a direction for treatment. The first short-term objective and coordinated interventions examine the history of the client’s eating pattern, self-perception of body image, personal and interpersonal triggers to problematic eating and actual weight. 

00:42:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE The second objective and it’s two interventions are focused on interviewing for unhealthy use of weight control measures, such as self induced vomiting and non purging compensatory behaviors such as misuse of laxatives or enemas. 

00:42:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Psychological testing or objective measures may be used as a part of the overall assessment of the eating disorder. And then referrals should be made to a physician to rule out possible medical etiologies and assess for any medical effects of the eating disorder or obesity. A nutritional evaluation and possible nutritional rehabilitation maybe indicated, particularly in the case of anorexia. A dental exam may be indicated if purging behaviors are used by the client. Objective seven could be selected for the client’s treatment plan if a psychiatric evaluation is in order to assess the need for psychotropic medications as an adjunct to the treatment. 

00:43:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Finally, objective eight describes the possible need for medical or psychiatric hospitalization if it is determined to assessment at the client’s health is severely compromised by the eating disorder or if a significant psychiatric condition such as a severe mood disorder is also present. 

00:43:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA The fourth section of our treatment plan captures common psychoeducational themes used to assist the client in understanding the eating disorder and its treatment. Objectives 9 and 10 focus on the client’s task of gaining an understanding of the development of his or her condition and the treatment approaches that will be used. The therapist discusses socio-cultural pressures that encourage maladaptive eating patterns and provides a rationale for the treatment approach being used. Some reading material may be assigned to aid in educating the client. 

00:44:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Now we examine the statements that summarize the research supported family-based treatment for anorexia nervosa. Objective number 11 and its three associated with interventions summarize this treatment approach for our treatment plan. Phase one focuses on taking a history of the eating disorder. Clarifying that the parents will be in charge of weight restoration of the client. Establishing healthy weight goals and asking the family to participate in the family meal in session. In phase two of this treatment, weight continues to be closely monitored. Control overeating is gradually turned over to the adolescent client as normal eating patterns emerge. And finally in phase three, the focus is on consolidating and reinforcing the newly stabilized eating patterns and weight gain. Adolescent developmental issues are addressed and problem-solving and relapse prevention skills are also typically taught. 

00:45:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Let’s take a look at a vignette that demonstrates some of the features of family focused treatment for anorexia. In this vignette, the therapist, parents, and adolescent discuss handing over responsibility for eating to the adolescent. An interaction that is characteristic of the transition from phase one to phase two of the therapy. 

00:45:50
DAVE So how are things been since our last session? 

00:45:50
TOM I think they’ve been a lot better. 

00:45:55
DAVE How so? 

00:45:55
TOM Well, Danielle has worked off her plateau and she’s gained a few more pounds. 

00:46:00
DAVE Joan, what’s your impression? 

00:46:00
JOAN The same. Umm… A few weeks ago I didn’t think she was getting enough calories, but over the past few weeks she has been taking bigger portions. And without us even, you know, having to ask her to. 

00:46:15
DAVE You’ve been monitoring her, her eating and calorie intake closely? 

00:46:15
JOAN Oh, yes. 

00:46:20
DAVE Good. You too, Tom? 

00:46:20
TOM Yes, we’ve been giving Danielle a little more choice. And how much he eats and she’s been eating well. 

00:46:25
DAVE Good, I’m glad to hear that. So why did you decide to let Danielle have more choice? 

00:46:35
JOAN Well, Danielle asked us to but also because she’s doing better and yet sometimes she gives us that look, you know, like we’re prison guards watching over the prisoner. 

00:46:45
DAVE Do you feel like a prisoner, Danielle? 

00:46:45
DANIELLE Sometimes. It’s like, I don’t know. I just feel like they think I’m not going to do what I’m supposed to. Like, they don’t trust me. 

00:46:55
DAVE Is it? Is that your concern that you don’t trust her? 

00:47:00
TOM No, we just want her to be able to succeed. 

00:47:00
JOAN Yeah, we just don’t want this thing to take control again. I mean, it’s not her, it’s the anorexia. 

00:47:10
DAVE How do you feel about that, Danielle? 

00:47:10
DANIELLE I know that. It’s just that I feel like I can do this now. I don’t need them to watch everything I do. 

00:47:15
DAVE Okay. Well, you know, this treatment program moves in phases. In the beginning, the parents take primary responsibility for ensuring that eating patterns are stable and sufficient to allow weight to be gained, that’s because of the health risk involved. But at some point we make the transition to having Danielle take more responsibility in that area again. Danielle, it sounds like you, you think you’re ready to begin that. 

00:47:40
DANIELLE I do. 

00:47:40
DAVE So, so what makes you think so? 

00:47:45
DANIELLE Well, I think I’m doing well. I mean, the doctor said so. 

00:47:45
DAVE That’s good. I saw that in the doctor’s report. Besides the doctor telling you that your health is improving, what else have you noticed in yourself that makes you feel you’re ready? 

00:47:55
DANIELLE Well, I’m eating larger portions. I’m doing that myself. And I’m taking my calcium every day. I didn’t like hearing about how my bones could get that brittle and like it’s going to take a while for them to get strong again. 

00:48:10
DAVE You’re more concerned about the health risks and that’s motivating you more than it used to. 

00:48:15
DANIELLE Yeah, I always kind of knew about them, but I guess when it actually happened to me, it was different. I’m feeling better and I can see it’s because I’m eating. 

00:48:20
DAVE That’s different than when you first started treatment? 

00:48:25
DANIELLE Yeah, when I first heard that I was gaining weight, it was kind of scary. But after a while it didn’t bother me as much. 

00:48:30
DAVE Is it’s still a struggle? 

00:48:30
DANIELLE Not like it used to be. I think I’m doing a lot better, just focusing on getting healthier and getting my life back. I feel like I’m ready to get my life back. 

00:48:40
DAVE I can see that. So how do you guys feel about handing over some of the responsibility to Danielle? Are you ready? Do you think she’s ready? 

00:48:50
JOAN I think so. I still want to know how she’s doing. 

00:48:55
TOM I’m thinking we can try it. 

00:48:55
DAVE So how can we hand some of this responsibility back to Danielle and also feel assured that, that she’s continuing her success? 

00:49:05
TOM What about the doctor’s report? I mean, if they continue to be good, then we know she must be doing well. If not I guess we’re just going back to what we were doing. 

00:49:15
DAVE Joan, how does that strike you? 

00:49:15
JOAN That sounds good. 

00:49:15
DAVE Danielle, do you ever problem with what your mom and dad are suggesting? That you take control over how much you eat, use a doctor’s report and talk here? 

00:49:25
DANIELLE No, I know I can do it. 

00:49:25
DAVE Okay, good. Let’s just talk more specifically about what this eating pattern will look like over the next week and the targets we’d like to see in the doctor’s report. 

00:49:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Well, in this particular vignette we’re starting to see the transition here and that starts with the parents being in control in phase I. And Dave is trying to move them into phase II here and getting all of the data that he needs to make that decision. 

00:49:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, he’s gonna have some criteria he’s looking for to see if it’s met. So, you know, how did the parents feel about it? How’s the adolescent feeling? And I like that he was, he was asking questions to get at that information but doing it in a way where they felt like they were part of that decision-making process. 

00:50:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA He gets the perspective all the different family members here and that’s good for him to make a decision to, to help them move into adolescent control. 

00:50:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Absolutely. 

00:50:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA And he also looks for what basis they have for moving to stage two, the asset of each one of those particular family members. 

00:50:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. And I think in this therapy, you know, if you, if you look at the training manuals and the book that’s been written on at, the nature of this, of the therapist style is serious and concerned because this is a potentially dangerous disorder. And here you’re also at the same time not trying to make all these decisions for everyone. You’re trying to get them to make those and keep those criteria in mind. So they wanted to see a certain amount of weight loss and I thought he did a good job of saying, all right, how are we going to make this transition but still be accountable, still be able to see if, you know, things start to turn for the worse. 

00:51:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA And if weight loss happens, it’s time to return to more control on the part of the parents. 

00:51:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Back to Phase I. 

00:51:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yep, yep. So the specifics of the change to Phase II and what will be involved in that were also kind of outlined and he draws it from the parents. What is it gonna mean to be in stage two here? Yeah. 

00:51:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I thought that was good. 

00:51:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA And then there’s a section where he talks about… Well, what will it mean to be successful in Phase II and those are identified. How will we know we’re doing well? 

00:51:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Very good. You know kind of identifying their objectives, their goals… 

00:51:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA The role of the doctor, the physician, and it’s brought out. 

00:51:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. Excellent. And I think this demonstrates what this therapy is about. It’s one little transition. But you can see, I mean, it’s a family unit being treated as a family unit and they’re gonna… And they move down, they’re gonna work toward communication and problem solving as a family unit and so on. 

00:51:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah, good job. 

00:52:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been identified as a research supported treatment for late adolescents and adults with bulimia. To represent this approach we have written Objective 12 for the client and its integrated interventions for the therapist to implement. 

00:52:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Intervention one for this objective focuses on psychoeducation and self-monitoring of relevant features of bulimia. The therapeutic interventions in the second phase of CBT for bulimia lean heavily on teaching problem-solving and doing cognitive restructuring to identify challenge and replace negative cognitive messages that mediate feelings and actions leading to maladaptive eating and weight control practices. Homework assignments may be used in any of these phases to reinforce the achievement of the client objective. The final phase of CBT focuses on strengthening skills and gains made in therapy as well as relapse prevention. Intervention number three captures these emphases. 

00:53:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE The following vignette shows various scenes representing progressive phases of CBT for bulimia, including psychoeducation, coping skills training, addressing common fears and planning for high risk situations. Let’s take a look at this. 

00:53:20
DAVE So given what we’ve discussed in what you’ve read, what’s your take on this cycle? 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN Well, it seems like when I try dieting, it eventually makes me want to binge and I feel bad, afraid, I’m gonna gain weight. So I purge. And it just repeats over and over. 

00:53:35
DAVE And how do you feel after purging? 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN Well, honestly I feel good and bad. 

00:53:45
DAVE How so? 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN Well, good, and that I feel like I won’t gain weight but bad because well I feel like I can’t control myself. 

00:53:50
DAVE So by restricting your diet, it actually drives your urge to binge, then bingeing leads to fears of gaining weight and makes you want to purge? You feel better temporarily, but then you start to feel guilty like you don’t feel in control. And the cycle repeats itself the next time around. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, that sounds like me. 

00:54:10
DAVE Bingeing does this to everyone. Does it make sense to you that if you can break this cycle, it will help you reach your goals? 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, but I haven’t been able to. 

00:54:20
DAVE I understand. Let’s talk about the first step in breaking the cycle, regulating when you eat. 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN Okay, I understand about trying to get on a regular eating pattern, but if I stop skipping meals to help reduce the urge to binge, won’t I just gain a bunch of weight? 

00:54:40
DAVE Well, remember, we agree that our first goal is to reduce the bingeing and purging. Having said that most people don’t gain a bunch of weight when they make this transition. In fact, most people find that their weight fluctuates more down and up when they’re not on a regular schedule. 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN Really? 

00:54:55
DAVE Yeah, part of this is because we’re regulating when you eat, not how much or what you eat. Establishing a regular pattern reduces urges to binge. So your overall calories don’t necessarily have to be more. It depends on the types of meals and snacks you have. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN I see. I guess I’m worrying about the weight issue again. It’s just hard to weigh myself once a week. 

00:55:20
DAVE I know. Do you mind if we talk a little more about that weight, health, and how these two things relate to one another? Then, maybe we can start to look at what your meals and snacks could be, when and where you’re going to eat and the like. Does that sound okay? 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN Okay. I know I need to get used to feeling full as being normal and not assign that I’ve overeat, that’s hard. 

00:55:45
DAVE What’s hardest about it before you? 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN The urges, how to deal with them. 

00:55:55
DAVE Okay, let’s talk about that. One of the first things to know in coping with urges is that if you can ride them out some, they will decrease. The urges get weaker. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN I read that in the workbook. I guess I’ve never really waited to see but the workbook did have a graph. 

00:56:10
DAVE That’s right. The urge actually does something like this. It goes up to a point and then it comes down. Our goal is to get you past that hump. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN It looks like a wave. 

00:56:20
DAVE Exactly. Some people call this surfing the urge. 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN Surfing the urge, huh? But I never surfed before. 

00:56:30
DAVE Let’s talk about how to surf then, what do you say? 

00:56:30
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:56:35
DAVE So you’re worried about this thing coming up on Friday night. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. I’m sure some people are going to bring snacks and stuff and I don’t want to, you know, fall off the wagon. 

00:56:45
DAVE Okay, so let’s problem-solve like we’ve done with the others. First, let’s define the problem specifically. We know the situation, so what’s your goal? 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN I don’t want to over eat snacks at the party I suppose. 

00:56:55
DAVE That’s good. That’s specific. I want to prevent myself from over eating snacks at the party. Let’s move to options that might help us to do this. Can you think of any? 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN I was thinking I would take my own snack and limit the amount I eat that way. 

00:57:10
DAVE Just eat what you bring. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. If anyone asks, I could just say, my snack sits better with me or something. 

00:57:15
DAVE Okay, we’ll way to evaluate that option. Any other options? 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN I was thinking of taking some sugar-free tea with me to keep me satisfied, so I don’t feel like drinking high-calorie stuff that will tempt me to perch. 

00:57:30
DAVE Okay, let’s look at some more options and then we’ll evaluate the pros and cons of all of them. 

00:57:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA I thought he made good use of psychoeducation and he’s integrating that throughout the session, not just at the beginning but he’s always teaching some of the method here. 

00:57:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I mean, one of the phrases we’ve used in treatment planning is there’s initial and ongoing psychoeducation. Because it’s kinda like once you start something, you continue to integrate it and he demonstrates that here. 

00:57:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA And we talk about relationship skills and how they need to be important in terms of applying a technique. He used good reflective listening skills here to make the person feel understood. 

00:58:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE You can see they have a good therapeutic relationship there. And here’s, you know, here’s a patient who hasn’t talked about this and there’s a lot of shame around these things and he’s creating an environment where she can do that. 

00:58:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA And then the urges. He’s talking about the urges and how they need to be coped with. And so he begins to develop coping skills to deal with those. 

00:58:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Surfing the urge. 

00:58:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yes. 

00:58:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right, which comes out of substance abuse treatment, right? 

00:58:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yes, right. 

00:58:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE And it’s kind of a staple of CBT to look at… Okay, you’re making these positive changes. What are some of the risks out there and how can we manage some of the things that you find challenging? Yeah. 

00:58:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA He identifies high-risk situations, I make a note here. He identified specifics of those. What are they? Let’s say them clearly and identify them clearly and behaviorally. 

00:58:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE And then he goes into, what, you know, what’s the skill we’re going to use to try to manage those? He takes that into problem-solving. 

00:59:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Exactly. 

00:59:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE And applying problem-solving with a relevant real-life high-risk situation and they are going to do that with anticipated future high-risk situations as well. 

00:59:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA And I like how he draws options for dealing with these high-risk situations out of the client rather than saying, well, here’s three things you could do. 

00:59:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE He’s trying to empower them. 

00:59:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA He draws them out with the client very nicely. 

00:59:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah, he wants her to be able to do this. You know, essentially in CBT the therapist is trying to put themselves out of business. 

00:59:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Multiple CBT techniques integrated into one session here, not just one. 

00:59:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Representing, you know, cross-section to time in the therapy. Yeah. 

00:59:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Very good. Another research supported treatment for bulimia is interpersonal therapy. Objective 13 describes the client task for this approach. Phase I of this therapy involves a thorough assessment of the eating disorder as well as important past and present interpersonal relationships. The therapist takes the lead in doing this interpersonal inventory and assesses interpersonal issues such as disputes, role transition conflicts, unresolved grief, interpersonal deficits. In the second phase of the treatment, the client takes the lead by talking freely about the identified problem area or areas, exploring alternative ways to view the problem and resolve it. The final phase focuses on consolidating and reinforcing the interpersonal gains made and developing a relapse prevention plan. 

01:00:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Our next vignette involves two scenes representing the two phases of IPT. One depicts a scene from the assessment phase of the therapy and the other from the interpersonal phase. Let’s take a look at those now. 

01:00:50
DAVE So I just want to explain the nature of this therapy, so you have a good sense of what to expect. 

01:00:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:00:55
DAVE It’s helpful to think of our therapy is having two distinct phases. The first phase which may take a few sessions is for information gathering. I want to learn about your eating problem from when it began until now. I also want to learn about important past and present relationships. I’ll take the lead in this phase by asking you questions. Your role is just answer and discuss the issues with me as best you can. When I have a sufficient understanding of these things, you and I will discuss and come to an agreement on which issue or issues we will focus on for the rest of therapy. Does that sound okay to you? 

01:01:30
UNKNOWN It sounds okay. 

01:01:30
DAVE All right. After the information gathering phase, the nature of therapy will change. Instead of me asking you questions and you answering them, you’ll take more of the lead by talking about the issue or issues we agreed to focus on. You can talk about whatever you like regarding the issues we select. I may have questions or comments to get the ball rolling but for the most part, you’re just expected to explore your thoughts and feelings about the issue. Try to be open to considering new ways of approaching the issue. And this may lead to some positive changes. Are you willing to try that? 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN I can try. I’m not used to talking about this stuff, but I have to get better so I’ll try. 

01:02:15
DAVE Very good. That’s all it’s asked. Ready get started? 

01:02:15
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:02:20
DAVE Okay. Let’s start with the eating problem. Look back, when did this start for you? 

01:02:25
UNKNOWN I guess I was about 11 years old when I first started bulimia, but I didn’t try it until I was 14. My parents divorced and I lived with my mom. We move to a new house and I went to a new school. 

01:02:35
DAVE What was that like for you? 

01:02:40
UNKNOWN I hated it. 

01:02:40
DAVE What about it did you hate? 

01:02:45
UNKNOWN Oh, I lost all my old friends and I was the new kid. You know, there are already all these cliques established. I had to eat lunch by myself. 

01:02:55
DAVE You felt lonely? 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. Plus, the people at that school were mean. Some of the popular girls would make fun of the way I looked, my clothes. They’d call me plain, fat, say things like, oh, my gosh, look at that dress and stuff like that. 

01:03:10
DAVE How do you recall feeling about that at the time? 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN Like, I just wanted to get out of there, go back to my old school, my old friends. I started to doubt myself. Back then my dad had left us. I felt like he must not have loved me. 

01:03:25
DAVE He left because he didn’t love you? 

01:03:25
UNKNOWN No, I guess not. He and mom weren’t happy but you left and then he got remarried. 

01:03:30
DAVE You felt abandoned. 

01:03:35
UNKNOWN Kind of. I mean, I know that just because he got remarried, it doesn’t mean he didn’t love me, but it felt that way. 

01:03:45
DAVE At that time you saw it is him not loving you. But you now see that there may have been other reasons why he remarried. 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. I mean, he was happier and I guess I was feeling like, I don’t know like he was happier without me. 

01:04:00
DAVE You thought your absence and not his wife’s presence was what was making him look happier? 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN I guess so. I know that’s not why, but I guess I was feeling that way, rejected. 

01:04:10
DAVE You started to doubt yourself because you felt rejected by the girls at the new school. At the same time, you didn’t fully understand why your dad was doing what he was doing. You thought something was wrong with you that he was rejecting you and it made him happier. 

01:04:30
UNKNOWN I guess so. I never really talked to my dad about this. 

01:04:35
DAVE You’re thinking about doing that? 

01:04:35
UNKNOWN Maybe it’s time. 

01:04:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA The therapist explains the roles very nicely of himself and the client here and the various phases of therapy the roles are gonna change. 

01:04:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I think you know especially with this therapy where you do have a pretty distinct change in the relationship, you know, from being therapists led to client lead. It’s a very good thing to explain that because I think that would be difficult for the client to just suddenly shift and become somewhat non-directive and clarifying. So really good and a feature of this therapy that I will do… 

01:05:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Not a good thing to keep the client guessing to let them know. 

01:05:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

01:05:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA All right. In Phase One the therapist is asking questions and he’s clarifying relationship issues. So it’s, it’s the assessment stage here and he’s taking more of an active role. 

01:05:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE It’s that interpersonal inventory right and he’s going to assess the eating disorder too. And what’s kind of unusual for some folks who aren’t familiar with this, he’s not gonna talk a lot about that in phase two, they’re gonna focus on whatever interpersonal issues are identified in phase one. So he’s in the process of assessing those things and that could take a few sessions. 

01:05:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Oh, sure. 

01:05:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

01:05:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Then we fade out in this vignette and we come back into a phase two type session. And in this case, he’s doing more reflective listening. 

01:05:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE You can see the change in his style. 

01:05:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA It’s more non-directive. 

01:05:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

01:06:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

01:06:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Lot of clarifying. You know, like you said, a lot of reflection. One of the things they’re trying to do is if, if conflicts evident, you know, like, well, you know, it sounds like you’ve done this but you’ve done that. They’re gonna, they’re gonna clarify that and let the client work through those. 

01:06:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA And then the client begins to develop some insight here particularly about her father and I’ve never really talked about these things with him and maybe it’s not true what I was thinking. And so she’s beginning to get some insight here. What will he do with that? 

01:06:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, you know, what he did with it was, I think recognized, here’s a place for some potential change and then he brings that up. So do you think it’s time for that? It’s still gonna be that client’s decision. But that’s, you know, very good therapeutic awareness that this may be a moment of opportunity for her to do something significant. 

01:06:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA In the future there’s gonna be some implementation of a change perhaps on her part. 

01:06:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, there might. And that’s where some of the behavioral strategies might come in, because sometimes an IPT, let’s say she decides I’m gonna talk to dad. Well, how do you feel about that? And they may actually do some more behavioral type stuff in rehearsing that, talking about… 

01:07:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Role play it? 

01:07:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Sure. Yeah, they’ll do that in there. Behavioral weight-loss treatments are a set of identified research supported treatments for obesity. The most studied of these is the LEARN program, which emphasizes change in lifestyle, exercise, attitudes, relationships, and nutrition. To integrate this approach into our treatment plan, we suggest statements such as our objective number14 which refers to the implementation of these five emphases of the program. The first refers to psychoeducation to introduce and clarify the five facets of LEARN. The second intervention describes the heart of the LEARN approach in which the client and therapist work their way through the program’s emphasis to establish new eating patterns through overall behavioral change. 

01:07:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Our last vignette shows a therapist introducing the learn acronym to the client. It represents a psychoeducational introduction to the program. Let’s take a peek in on this session. 

01:08:10
DAVE Bob, I know you’ve done some reading by now about the LEARN weight management program. So you know that the central tenant of the program is that you must develop new habits and make them permanent part of your new life. It’s not a diet program. It’s a lifestyle change program. The focus is on behavior change that leads to weight loss. And because much of our behavior stems from the way that we think and make decisions, we also look at those thinking patterns and see if they’re helping us with our behavior change goals. 

01:08:40
BOB Yeah, I read the introduction of the manual and it makes sense. 

01:08:45
DAVE Good. Why don’t we take a quick look at the five aspects of the LEARN program and think about how they might apply to your life. The L of the LEARN acronym stands for lifestyle. What lifestyle changes, like changes in your day-to-day activities might help you lose weight? 

01:09:00
BOB Well, I have to stay away from sweets and soda. I got a lot of unnecessary calories right there. 

01:09:05
DAVE All right, that’s good insight. So one of the things the program will suggest is to eliminate high calorie foods from the house or from easy access. Replacing sweet snacks with healthy snacks is another. We’ll talk more about that later. 

01:09:20
BOB I also eat when I’m not hungry, that has to change. 

01:09:25
DAVE Perfect. Learning skills to cope with those moments as part of this too. We can talk about how using things like distracting activities and enforced eating delays might help you achieve this goal. So let’s move on now to the second aspects of the program. E stands for exercise. What about your physical activity level? 

01:09:45
BOB You know, I certainly don’t get enough exercise. I play golf once a week and walk the dog around the block but that’s about it. 

01:09:55
DAVE Perhaps we can build on those activities. This program will encourage you to try to increase in activity on a daily basis. So for example we may consider increasing your walk around the block to more vigorous daily walking. It will help if you keep a diary of your exercise and perhaps find a partner to exercise with. Accountability and social support can be beneficial in accomplishing this behavior change. 

01:10:20
BOB I know it would be good for me to, you know, get off the couch and be more active. 

01:10:20
DAVE All right. So the third component of the LEARN program is attitude change. Do you see a need for this in yourself? 

01:10:30
BOB I’m not sure what it means. 

01:10:30
DAVE One aspect of attitude is focused on thinking traps that can derail your progress. For example, being too perfectionistic or rigid in your attempt to change your behavior is an attitude issue. For example, you think if I’m not perfect, I failed. Setting realistic goals using positive confidence self talk rather than pessimistic discouraging self-taught as another part of this. Does that help you? 

01:11:00
BOB Yeah, I see. I tended to get easily discouraged in the past when things got off track. So this is an area that I need some help. 

01:11:05
DAVE Excellent. Your openness to change and readiness to change is likely to help you. Now the fourth letter in our LEARN acronym is R for relationship resources. What thoughts do you have about this, Bob? 

01:11:20
BOB Well, my wife has been after me for years to get serious about weight loss. So I’m sure she’ll encourage me. 

01:11:25
DAVE Okay, telling friends and family of your lifestyle change and asking them to support you is strongly encouraged in this program. Now the final component of the Learn program is N for nutrition. Do you have a solid understanding of healthy nutrition, Bob? 

01:11:45
BOB I understand the five major food groups but that’s about it. I sure don’t eat the recommended servings. 

01:11:50
DAVE The program does teach you the recommended number of servings for the food groups. It also teaches you to be aware of calorie content, serving size, fat content, and a balanced diet. Changing eating behaviors is likely to be more successful when you have nutritional information. 

01:12:05
BOB I know I have to make some lifestyle changes to maintain any weight loss or I’ll just regain it like I’ve done before. 

01:12:10
DAVE Exactly. This program consists of approximately 12 weekly lessons that are summarized in the manual you started reading. We’ll be following this pretty closely over the next three months. So reading will help you stay on top of things. 

01:12:30
BOB I think I’m ready to get started. 

01:12:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Psycho Ed, a strong component of this, as he’s introducing the program to the client. So this session is early on, client has done a little reading and now it’s time to, for the therapist to clarify the components here. 

01:12:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it’s kind of an overview of what this client is going to be doing, what they can expect. There’s probably a little bit of an assessment of, you know, what’s the client’s reaction to some of this stuff, you know, and you could see him doing that. And also like you said, doing a lot of education, well, we’re gonna be talking about, you know, this issue and we may… He even got into a few specifics at this point. Yeah. 

01:13:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA But again he’s drawing the client into the discussion, not just lecturing to them and asking them, what changes might you see happening at each one of these stages and how would this apply to you? 

01:13:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. I think, you know, with the one-to-one version of this which what we’re seeing I think you might need to do that but, this has also been done in group where it does get a little bit more didactic but ideally you want to… 

01:13:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA But then they controlled out to the group and ask them for application. Sure. 

01:13:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Absolutely. 

01:13:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Therapists also uses some examples I noted here to clarify those components such as, when he was in the attitude component and what does that mean and the client was confused. So he gave him some examples as a way of clarifying, I thought that was well done. 

01:13:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I thought so too. I mean he wants to see, you know, are you understanding what you’re about to do. And again assessing what the clients who are actually… Here was the reaction where the client’s and asked what this means and he was able to help and clarify that. Of course he’s going to revisit every single one of these, right? And they’re gonna dive into every single one of these. 

01:14:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure, over the next multiple sessions. 

01:14:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right, exactly. 

01:14:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

01:14:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

01:14:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA And each component is clarified and explained as he goes through each step of the acronym. And then that’s just an overall view for the client to have. 

01:14:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. I think the value of this vignette is just that. You know, what is this program? What’s the acronym mean? What are some examples of what we might be doing? Its implementation is then like we just discussed going to be, you know, each of these things. And actually they’re gonna do this kind of integration synergistically of all these things. 

01:14:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA And he’s also going back and bringing in that homework assignment. Oh, we see the client has done some reading, this is time to process what you’ve read and to make it real. 

01:14:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, so let’s validate your efforts. 

01:14:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

01:14:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Whether treated pharmacologically or psychologically, eating disorders are prone to relapse. By their nature, research supported treatments for anorexia nervosa are relapsed preventative. Treatments for bulimia, binge-eating disorder and obesity also place a heavy emphasis on preventing relapse. Let’s take a look at some common considerations in relapse prevention interventions and how they can be incorporated into your treatment plan. 

01:15:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA One of the first steps in relapse prevention interventions is to provide a rationale for them. This typically involves a discussion of the risk for relapse and how using the relapse prevention approach we will outline can lower that risk. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this. 

01:15:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Another initial step in this relapse prevention approach is to distinguish between a lapse and relapse. A lapse is presented as a rather common temporary setback that may involve for example re-experiencing an urge to binge or purge, beginning to restrict one’s diet again or starting to skip exercise sessions after having established a program. Relapse on the other hand is described as a return to a sustain pattern of thinking, feeling, and acting that is characteristic of the previous eating disorder or problem. The rationale for this distinction is that lapses do not need to develop into a relapse if they can be caught and managed. This component of relapse prevention can be captured in a therapist’s intervention such as this one. 

01:16:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA The next step in relapse prevention is to assist the client and identifying future circumstances which might trigger strong anxiety. Once these situations are identified, the therapist and client rehearse coping with them using skills learned in therapy such as those involved in surfing urges or asserting oneself with peers. 

01:16:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE In addition to using skills learned in therapy to manage high-risk situations, clients are encouraged to use strategies learned in therapy during their day-to-day life to help maintain gains and prevent relapse. Examples include, maintaining a regular eating schedule. Self statements reflecting the new messages gained through cognitive restructuring. Inconsistent use of problem-solving skills to address problems. The intervention now on your screen reflects these emphases in the treatment plan. 

01:17:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sometimes clients benefit from having a coping card or other reminder of important strategies and information regarding relapse prevention. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this. 

01:17:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Finally, periodic booster sessions of therapy can help reinforce positive changes, problem-solve challenges and facilitate continued improvement. So clients are invited to periodically revisit therapy for these purposes. Treatment intervention number four describes the use of booster sessions in the treatment plan. On your screen now appears and example of an evidence-based treatment plan for anorexia nervosa. Sample treatment plans for other eating disorders and obesity can be found in the Companion Workbook to this DVD. 

01:18:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA This sample plan includes a specification of the primary problem, behavioral definitions of the problem applicable to your client, the diagnosis, a long-term goal of treatment and short-term client objectives and related therapists interventions consistent with those of research supported family-based treatment for anorexia nervosa, including those related to assessment. 

01:18:45
[sil.] 

01:18:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA The decision to hospitalize, psychoeducation, and phases one, two and three of the family-based therapy. Today’s discussion focused on evidence-based psychotherapy treatment planning using goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with those found and identified research supported treatments and evidence-based treatment guidelines. As we have shown, considerable research has been done and continues to be done in this area. 

01:19:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Remember, the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of evidence-based psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health problems. It’s designed to be informative in nature and did not intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed and demonstrated. For those interested in learning more about empirically supported treatments, references to their empirical support, clinical training materials, and training opportunities are provided in the Companion Workbook to this DVD. 

01:19:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Finally, the practice planner series of treatment planning, homework planning and progress note planning books published by John Wiley and Sons are helpful resources for the clinician. Many of the treatment planner books had been revised to include objectives and interventions consistent with the approach demonstrated in this series. For example, the complete adult psychotherapy treatment planner fourth edition contains a step-by-step guide to writing treatment plans for over 40 behaviorally based presenting problems. Many of the presenting problems are approached with evidence-based treatment planning. We hope this information will help you in helping your clients live more happy and productive lives.
