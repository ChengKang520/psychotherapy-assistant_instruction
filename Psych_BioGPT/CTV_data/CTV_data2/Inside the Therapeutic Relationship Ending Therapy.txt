ENDING THERAPY 

00:00:00
WITH RACHAEL CLYNE 

00:00:00
ENDING THERAPY Introduction 

00:00:40
RACHAEL CLYNE Beginnings, middles, and endings. The distinctive nature of these stages is emphasized in counseling training. No matter how joyful, planned, or wishful they may be, endings presage change and invariably involve loss as well as a degree of uncertainty about the future. Endings can be traumatic, unexpected, unwanted, or a relief. And echoes of our journey from dependant infant into separate adult individual poses the question of whether or not we feel robust enough to survive. All of these factors get wrapped up in our complex response to endings. So ending therapy doesn't just represent the finishing line; it can be an important piece of therapeutic work in its own right. In a short-term contract, the number of sessions is usually determined at the outset, and unless the client decides not to take up the full quota, they don't have a say in how long the contract will last. The counselor's ability to hold the time restriction and prepare their client for a predicted ending is very important. Ability to assess the appropriateness of the issues and the level of depth the client can safely tolerate. Clients sometimes try to put pressure on the counselor to extend the contract, and counselors often have to deal with a sense of the work being unfinished. I find that clients, knowing the ending in advance, usually protect themselves against too much attachment. However, a deadline can also produce surprisingly rapid results. But while there's opportunity to acknowledge the issue of ending in time-limited work, there isn't the time to process any related issues. In an open-ended situation, as we'll be looking at in this extract, the ending is more organic and can be negotiated between client and counselor. Whether it's short- or long-term, hopefully the ending represents a successful conclusion to the client-counselor relationship. However, there can be hidden issues that need to be explored before that successful conclusion can be reached. And there are of course exceptions when life events such as illness or accident can force a sudden ending. How the issue is raised varies. Occasionally, a client cancels or fails to turn up without explanation, and the counselor is left holding unanswered questions which may or may not be characteristic of the client's process. Sometimes clients do what I call "a hit and run" by announcing at the end of the session that they don't want to come anymore. In this case, the counselor has to try and hold the discussion over to the next session, rather than engaging with such an important issue just as the client's walking out of the door. Many counselors, including myself, incorporate advice about ending therapy in their initial contract, that it's fine to decide to end, but that it's best discussed together first. More often than not, both parties become aware that the issues are now being resolved, and that the work is coming to an end. Sometimes there's just a lull where there don't seem to be any specific topics, and perhaps sessions are becoming chatty and superficial. There can be more than one reason for this. It can indicate that an opportunity to go deeper is waiting around the corner, rather like the still waters before going over rapids. A client may be unconsciously avoiding or indeed preparing to enter the next stage of their process. However, it can also be a sign that the work is coming to an end. In either case, it's important to check with the client what their sense is and perhaps suggest a review. In the session you're about to see, the client and I have been working together for 18 months. 

00:05:30
RACHAEL CLYNE Okay, Fiona, have you thought about how you want to use this session? 

00:05:35
FIONA Well, I did think, you know, I mean, I often think on the, you know, as I, as I'm coming to sessions, um, about what I will talk about, and I couldn't, to be honest with you, think of anything that I wanted to talk about today. So, um, I'm sure something will come to me. 

00:05:55
RACHAEL CLYNE It's something I've noticed has come up a few times in the last few weeks. 

00:06:00
FIONA How do you mean? 

00:06:00
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, you know, wondering what to, to focus the session on and what that's like for you. 

00:06:10
FIONA Um, well, you know, in the past, it's been, uh, quite, quite often if I felt a sort of inner resistance or, yeah, I suppose if I felt a resistance to talking to you, then it's been because I've been sitting on something that I haven't wanted to look at, really. Um, and 

00:06:30
RACHAEL CLYNE And what's it like today? 

00:06:30
FIONA Um, well, I feel a bit kind of, I don't really want to be in this room. I mean, I'd like to, you know, just go out and have a cup of coffee with you or something. Do you know what I mean? 

00:06:45
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, that's interesting. That's the first time you've mentioned that. 

00:06:45
FIONA Yeah. I get, yeah. 

00:06:50
ENDING THERAPY Preparing to end 

00:06:50
RACHAEL CLYNE I wonder why that is? What does her wish to be friends suggest? Is it an affirmation of equality, independence, a cue to end the therapy? Or is it a sign of continuing positive transference and her idealization of me? Or could it be both? 

00:07:15
FIONA I don't know, really. Um. 

00:07:20
RACHAEL CLYNE Does it feel like you wanna be more sociable with me? 

00:07:25
FIONA Yeah, I, I suppose I feel, I feel like it'd be nice just to have a chat, you know, and talk about other things, other than myself, to you. 

00:07:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, we've done a lot of work, haven't we? We've been working together for about 18 months now, and you've done some really good work. 

00:07:40
FIONA Um, thanks. So, so what are you saying? 

00:07:50
RACHAEL CLYNE I don't know. Maybe it's a good point to have a review of where we are with the therapy, with the counseling. 

00:08:00
FIONA Um. 

00:08:05
RACHAEL CLYNE 'Cuz we've dealt, you know, a lot of the issues that you've brought. You've been working really hard on those, and the changes have begun to really make a difference to your life, haven't they? 

00:08:10
FIONA Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I mean, of course. It's made a huge difference, and I just, um, I don't know. I've just got this funny feeling now that, you know, you're gonna say, "Oh, I think you've had enough." Well, I mean, actually, fine, you know, I don't care really if you, if you wanna finish the sessions. 

00:08:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Is that what you want? What, what do you want? Fiona's interpreted my suggestion to review as a sign that I've decided to end the counseling. She's anticipated the possibility by naming it first, but presents it as my choice. So I hand it back to her to think about. In fact, we're both aware that the nature of the relationship and the work is changing, and she's quite right that I'm wondering whether it's time to end. But I want her to reflect on that possibility and certainly don't see it as my decision. 

00:09:15
FIONA Um, well, yeah. You know, I mean, yeah, I've done lots of work and have really moved on and, you know, maybe it's time to just sort of finish now, yeah. It's fine by me. 

00:09:35
RACHAEL CLYNE 'Cuz what one of the things I'm wondering, you know, I've got used to knowing you and knowing when you're avoiding things. I think we've begun to recognize that. But I don't get the feeling that that's happening for you at the moment. When you're talking about wanting to go out for a cup of coffee with me, it feels like, I've noticed the last few sessions we're kind of more having a chat. 

00:09:55
FIONA Yeah, I, I, so what you're saying really is that we should just like, knock it on the head and just finish the, the, the therapy, which is fine. I mean, you know, I knew that eventually we'd have to do this, and that's really fine. Great. So, um, what shall I do, just not come next week then? 

00:10:15
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, hang on a minute. Slow down, slow down. How would you feel about finishing? By making it my decision and jumping to a sudden conclusion, it feels like a survival reaction from a childlike place, an attempt to gain control. I respond by trying to ground her, to elicit her adult awareness, by reminding her of her progress and her self-reliance. This is a tricky dance between us as I try to catch her reactions and feed them back to her. Indeed, it's tricky and confusing for Fiona as well as she vacillates between an adult awareness that feels equal and self-directing and the child within, struggling to cope with impending loss and feelings of abandonment. At this moment, I'm perceived as the abandoner of that child, almost certainly the next in line to a long history of abandoners. I experience her as someone desperately trying to appear adult while stifling her child feelings. As the counselor, I have to hold her transferential projections and try to guide Fiona to find her own way through her crucial dilemma of separation. 

00:11:40
FIONA Fine. As I said, it would be great, you know, ‘cuz, ‘cuz you're right. I've got to the stage now where it'd be nice just to sort of, you know, talk to you as a friend, really. I don't wanna talk about 

00:11:50
RACHAEL CLYNE And that that's not really what the counseling's for, is it, not to have a chat as a friend. 

00:11:55
FIONA No. No, but I mean, I like you, and it would, okay, so what I'm saying is, yeah, great, we can finish the therapy. What I feel strange about is, well, how do you finish therapy, anyway? 

00:12:10
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, first of all, I, I certainly wouldn't, if, you know, it's something that we look at together and see if it's what we want to do. I certainly wouldn't suggest that we say, "Okay, I won't come next week. That'll be it." If we decide to end the, the counseling, then perhaps that's something we can work towards. ‘Cuz I, I see ending counseling is a very important part of the work. And, um, well, it's also an acknowledgement of what you've achieved, isn't it? 

00:12:45
FIONA I know, I hate that, though. 

00:12:45
RACHAEL CLYNE Why? 

00:12:45
FIONA Well, ‘cuz, 'cuz it's like, uh, okay, you know, okay, you've achieved this, you've done that.., bye! You know? It feels like a dismissal. 

00:13:00
RACHAEL CLYNE And that's what I heard you doing a few minutes ago when you were just saying, okay, well, that's it. And for me, ending is a very important part of counseling. Honoring our relationship and the work that you've done, and it isn't just about bye. I see myself as, one of my purposes, if you like, is to do myself after the job. 

00:13:30
FIONA Sure. 

00:13:30
RACHAEL CLYNE Fiona emerges momentarily from her struggle and asks the wonderful question, "Well, how do you finish therapy, anyway?" enabling us to explore the issues and open our negotiation. I emphasize the possibility of ending as something we can take our time about without rushing a decision. Fiona's now aware that she's torn between the knowledge that the work's coming to an end and her attachment to our relationship. Voicing her perception that being acknowledged for achievement means being dismissed allows me to reflect a defensive reaction of self-dismissal, and it indicates some of the issues involved. 

00:14:20
FIONA There's this thing where you, you know, well, I've been seeing you for probably nearly 18 months now, right? And, you know, you, it's like you're part of my life. And there's part of me that says, "Okay, if I wanna keep paying you, and if I wanna keep coming to see you, then why shouldn't I do that?" You know, because you're a really important and positive part of my life now. 

00:14:45
RACHAEL CLYNE As a friend or as a counselor? 

00:14:50
FIONA Well, I suppose it's changing now. I mean, previously as a counselor, but as we're having this conversation now, it's, I mean, I kinda get that it has changed. The quality 

00:15:00
RACHAEL CLYNE Right, and how has it changed? 

00:15:00
FIONA Well, I suppose I feel more equal to you now. I don't feel like you're the person that I come to with all my troubles and you just, well, I suppose I want to find out things about you. 

00:15:15
RACHAEL CLYNE Right. 

00:15:15
FIONA But not necessarily about your life, but what you think about things and your opinion and, you know, what hopes and dreams you have for the future ‘cuz, you know, suddenly you're not just that sort of safe place that I used to come to when I couldn't deal with things myself. 

00:15:30
RACHAEL CLYNE Right. 

00:15:30
FIONA Um, so, I mean, I really feel 

00:15:40
RACHAEL CLYNE You don't need me to be there for you quite so much in the same way? 

00:15:45
FIONA No. No. 

00:15:45
RACHAEL CLYNE And you feel more equal, you feel more that you can 

00:15:50
FIONA Well, I feel like we've really, I feel like we've developed a friendship as well over the 18 months, which wouldn't necessarily have been the same with other, other counselors, I assume, but, you know, it is with us 'cuz 

00:16:05
RACHAEL CLYNE And the work's been really important for me too, with you, Fiona. I mean, I, I feel that we've worked well together. But there is, you know, it's such a strange relationship, counseling, you know, between a counselor and a client ‘cuz it, it is very intimate and I hear things about you that you've never told anyone else. And yet whilst there's a warm intimacy, we're not friends. It's still a working relationship and you know me as the person who's here to listen to you and be here for you. And it's been very creative. I think it's been brilliant. And I really, I've valued the things that you've shared, the trust that you've had in me. But it's, it's also, as you say, I mean, you know, your money, you're paying me. But you want now, what works for you. You come, you came to counseling with some very specific issues that you wanted to look at. It's very delicate when a client who's experienced a long and successful therapeutic alliance expresses the wish to become friends with their counselor. And this happens from time to time. In later stages, as the client becomes more self-reliant, the sense of partnership and rapport can be a joy on both sides. Fiona describes really well how her needs and her experience of our relationship have evolved as she's grown. As in any situation, some people feel naturally more connected than others. It needs to be handled with respect and tact so the boundary is held without the client's wish being dismissed or their feelings invalidated. I try to clarify the difference between friendship and therapeutic relationship, using our familiarity to evoke her wiser self and also to be as genuine as possible in expressing my own feelings about our connection and affirming the depth of what we've shared. What's going on? You look 

00:18:30
FIONA I just feel really, like, if I'm not coming here anymore, then it just makes all of this, um, irrelevant, like it never happened. I can't see a way of finishing it and having it be kind of part of my life. It's, well, that's not really expressing it very well, but that's what it, it feels like once, if I stop coming to see you, then this all just disappears. Even through you say we've done some really good work and 

00:19:05
RACHAEL CLYNE Did you want to carry on coming ad infinitum? 

00:19:10
FIONA Well, I guess not, realistically, but you know, why not? 

00:19:20
RACHAEL CLYNE Again, this reflects childlike perception, that to move forward means the past disappeared. It never happened. I try not to fall into her belief by getting her to look at the reality of continuing ad infinitum. This seems to allow her momentarily to refind her adult awareness. Then she reverts again. So we start to explore her feelings. 

00:19:55
[sil.] 

00:20:00
RACHAEL CLYNE You look quite sad. 

00:20:00
FIONA Yeah, ‘cuz I, I don't, I suppose in a way this is like some way that I know is my space, you know, is that idea that I can always come here, that there's someone here who, who listens to me and just listens to me. You, you know, I don't have to kind of, um, you, you know, and you've held my story. I, I, so it's like a bit of a sanctuary, and I don't want to have to let that go, really. 

00:20:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, today's the first day it's come up between us, and we don't have to make any decisions right now. It doesn't sound like you're sure about what you do want. Well, it sounds like you don't wanna let go right now. 

00:20:50
FIONA No, I don't wanna let go right now. And then part of me feels really kind of stupid and babyish for not wanting to let go ‘cuz, you know, 'cuz I could. I could just walk out, right, at the end of this session and just like, bye. That's it, I don't see you again. I could do that. 

00:21:10
RACHAEL CLYNE I can see right now how much this relationship means to you. 

00:21:15
FIONA Well, yeah. I mean, I 

00:21:20
RACHAEL CLYNE And given some of the things that we've looked at in your past history, when you went away to boarding school and those sort of times, I can understand how important it is for you to have to choice to hold on. 

00:21:35
FIONA Well, that's it, I mean, the, yeah, I mean, we've talked about the times in my life when I've just been, you know, uprooted and nobody prepared me for it, nobody said, "Okay, this is what you might need to do," I wasn't given any rights, if you like. 

00:21:50
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, I'm not sending you away. 

00:21:55
FIONA No, but it's easier if you do, almost, you know, ‘cuz that I can deal with. You know, I can deal with just going, "Right, okay, bye!" 

00:22:00
RACHAEL CLYNE So is that what you were doing before when you said, "Okay, right, that's fine if that's the way you want it," and it was like it was my decision? I don't see it as my decision, and it, it's not my decision to end the counseling, so I'm not going to do that. 

00:22:15
FIONA But I don't know how to do it any other way. 

00:22:20
RACHAEL CLYNE Now Fiona's begun to recognize and acknowledge her past wounds around endings, alongside the coping strategy she's developed, she tries to recreate the same scenario in the counseling because it's familiar. By reminding her of her boarding school past and her lack of choice at the time, I enable her to connect her present reactions with their source, and the knowledge I've gained of Fiona over a period of time supports this. I also try to enable her to distinguish between past situations where she felt powerless, where change was dictated by others, to the present, where she has control over the choice. This is a powerful opportunity for her to change the pattern and grow in maturity. 

00:23:15
FIONA You know, I don't know how to do it any other way other than, I suppose, you know, just go, “Right, okay, that's it. Right, finished. Okay," end the, end the thing. And then I'll, I could walk away and I'll sit there and I'll go, "Oh, uh, that was actually because you wanted the space for another client or, you know. 

00:23:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Because you felt abandoned or rejected. 

00:23:40
FIONA Yeah, or I didn't fit into your time table anymore so you just bumped me. I, I know that's not true, but 

00:23:45
RACHAEL CLYNE Fiona, we've been working together for 18 months now, and I hope that you, that's, is that something that you've been feeling all along? That I'm just fitting you into my time table? 

00:23:55
FIONA No, but you know that with, you know, I have this sense of so much being manipulated by other people just to fit into their lives and their way of doing things, that it doesn't really matter how close to me somebody is, I can still put myself in that place where I just think I'm the least important person. And even though their motives wouldn't be to hurt me, it's because they make me so small that I'm not important anymore. And they will then do anything, you know, without considering my feelings, really, and 

00:24:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Okay, well, one of the things that I'm aware of is that just raising the possibility of ending brings up a lot of feelings for you. 

00:24:45
FIONA Yeah, that's a, yeah. 

00:24:45
RACHAEL CLYNE And that's why ending is very important in therapy because it brings up those unresolved issues. And I'm not suggesting that we should decide to end, but it feels like that there's, you said that, you said something earlier about, “I don't know what other ways are possible." Maybe that's something we could explore. How would it be to do it differently? How would it be for you to have choice about it? How would it be for your feelings to be taken into account and for you to have the control? 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:30
RACHAEL CLYNE Fiona? 

00:25:30
FIONA I'm just thinking about, you know, people I've kind of lost, really. 

00:25:40
RACHAEL CLYNE People like? 

00:25:40
FIONA Just, um, you know, when I was a kid, just friends, and they'd move and then, you know. 

00:25:50
RACHAEL CLYNE So friendship's something that can be good and then it's just taken away? 

00:25:55
FIONA Yeah, and it, and 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
RACHAEL CLYNE Are you remembering things from school? Anyone in particular? 

00:26:10
FIONA I had a really, really, really good friend at, you know, at my first school, and then, then I was moved on to another school and 

00:26:20
RACHAEL CLYNE What was the name of your friend? 

00:26:20
FIONA Sarah. 

00:26:20
RACHAEL CLYNE Sarah. 

00:26:25
FIONA And, you know, the thing that really hurts me is that, is that I know I was really upset when we left, and I know she was really upset, but we were never allowed to be upset. 

00:26:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Or to say goodbye? 

00:26:35
FIONA Yeah, I think we did say goodbye, and we also wrote letters to each other, but it didn't last for very long, you know, ‘cuz your other life takes over and stuff, and it was just that, I just see this, I've just got this picture like, of these two little girls who're both really, really unhappy that they couldn't say, they, that they had to not be, they couldn't be together, and it was like, and then I have this sort of, you know, picture of grownups going, "Oh, never mind. I'm sure you can see each other in the holidays," or, "You can write letters to each other." And then that was all okay. 

00:27:10
RACHAEL CLYNE But you're little, every day counts, doesn't it? 

00:27:15
FIONA Yeah, and also 

00:27:15
RACHAEL CLYNE Because it's a long time. 

00:27:15
FIONA And also someone says you can write letters or, or maybe you can stay with each other in the holidays, then if you're only 7, you can't really organize that for yourself, you know? You kind of need them to support you in that, and there was, you know, it was just like all those things were said as a kind of palliative, you know, like, "Oh, that will stop the kids from getting too upset." Yeah. Pat them on, yeah. Um, well, just tell them any old rubbish and they'll never see each other again. 

00:27:45
RACHAEL CLYNE If you had the opportunity to say to your parents now what you couldn't say then about your friendship with Sarah, what would you say to them? 

00:27:55
FIONA Um, just that it was really important to me, and that, you know, things were important when you're 7, you know? And that's, things are really important when you're 7. They're as important as when you're 47 or 67. 

00:28:10
RACHAEL CLYNE Things? Can you be more specific, make a statement? 

00:28:15
FIONA Yeah, that my friendships were real friendships. 

00:28:15
RACHAEL CLYNE "My friendships are real. Don't take them away from me." 

00:28:20
FIONA Don't make them insignificant. Don't make them insignificant because they're the friendships of a child. You know? And that, yeah. So, phew. Where did all that come from? 

00:28:45
RACHAEL CLYNE Endings. Through the possibility of ending therapy, Fiona's been able to get in touch with some powerful memories of loss and of having her feelings and her friendships dismissed. She's been able to express what she couldn't say then and be heard. This seems to release her back to a more integrated awareness. Can I ask you, Fiona, just going back to the possibility of the counseling here ending, are you afraid that I'm just going to disappear if you finish the counseling, if we finish? 

00:29:25
FIONA Yeah, I get the sense, or I'll get this feeling of like, you know, laws of counseling, rules of engagement, and they're like, you know, like kind of stuff that grownups call, you know, to make it all neat and tidy. And I see that. I kind of resent that. You know, we've discussed that, you know 

00:29:45
RACHAEL CLYNE The 7-year-old in you resents it. 

00:29:45
FIONA Yeah. The 7-year-old in me wants, just wants to go well, why? You know, why does that have to be like that then?/ 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:05
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, I don't know that we're gonna find an answer to that today, Fiona, but it, it's really brought out some of the things that are making you hold on and that are important to you, and I'm really glad that you've said what you said. I'm really glad that 7-year-old Fiona has had a chance to express how she feels. And in life, we do have to face endings, don't we? And that's a mixture. It kind of brings up losses from the past, the bad endings, if you like, and I like to think that counseling can provide an opportunity to do it differently, to have a good ending. But that's something you and I have to explore together and decide whether we want to do that, and how we go about it. You know, sometimes people say, "Well, I'd like to aim to end in six months' time," or "I'd like another few sessions," or "Can I think about it?" You know, there's lots of different options. But on the other hand, do you really want to carry on coming and paying your money to me if there are no longer things that you want to work on here, if the work that we've done together is complete? 

00:31:25
FIONA Well, no, because, no, I don't, actually. I know, I mean, you know, I don't because it's sort of, but it seems like endings are next thing to deal with. You know, it feels like, okay, in order to end, we have to deal with endings and, and that just, I mean, you know, I'm already kind of, I've got this big lump here just thinking about endings, you know, which I'll probably think about a lot. 

00:31:50
RACHAEL CLYNE Right, so maybe endings is a topic for us to work on, but we don't have to actually act it out in reality. 

00:32:00
FIONA No, but I think if we, if we do the work, then it will naturally come to an end. 

00:32:05
RACHAEL CLYNE Okay. 

00:32:05
FIONA Okay, that's a way of looking at it. That's a way I hadn't looked at it before. You know, it's like, so then it isn't enforced, then it is like, right, okay, now we're dealing with endings. And we kinda know that the end of the endings will be, will be 

00:32:20
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, how would it be to think of it this way, Fiona, so that it's more of a completion rather than an ending? 

00:32:30
FIONA Yeah. I mean, it'd be great, wouldn't it, to get to the end of something and feel 

00:32:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Complete. 

00:32:35
FIONA Complete and excited about what's to come next, rather than like it's incomplete and it's just been sort of snatched away from you and it was, "I haven't finished." 

00:32:45
RACHAEL CLYNE Which is the pattern of your life which we've spent other sessions looking at as well, haven't we? Okay, well, we're coming towards the completion, stroke, ending of this session now. Is that, how does that feel? 

00:33:05
FIONA I feel a bit teary, but obviously, it was quite, I was kind of, you know, we had a laugh at the end, so that's good energy. 

00:33:15
RACHAEL CLYNE Right. And we found something to talk about, didn't we? 

00:33:20
FIONA Yes. And, uh, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate that identification really that I found now of the fact that for me an ending always means something incomplete. It always means something that I've not been allowed to finish. 

00:33:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Sudden and cut off. 

00:33:35
FIONA Yeah. And 

00:33:40
RACHAEL CLYNE No control. 

00:33:40
FIONA I don't know what it feels like to end something and have it completed. 

00:33:45
RACHAEL CLYNE All right. Well, I would really like us to try and find a way to do that for you. 

00:33:50
FIONA Okay. 

00:33:50
RACHAEL CLYNE That's, that feels good to me. Okay? 

00:33:55
FIONA Yeah. 

00:33:55
ENDING THERAPY The final session 

00:34:00
RACHAEL CLYNE If we do the work, then it will naturally come to an end. What a brilliant insight for Fiona, and an important shift from her history of ending equals unfinished, sudden, dictated by others to ending being a process that is in her control and that feels complete. This is the gift of good ending, the experience of completion and autonomy. I find it a useful distinction to offer to my clients. Given this is a roleplay simulation, one can only speculate on how Fiona and I spend the next few sessions. Probably examining other sudden endings from her past, and how this affects her relationships. Some issues may have already been explored to an extent, but ending counseling does trigger a different perspective. Hopefully, Fiona would recognize more fully how she recreates her sense of powerlessness in her adult life and how her defense reactions against being dismissed have turned her into the dismisser. In moving from perceiving herself as victim to one of active participant, she gained a level of understanding and awareness to effect positive change in her relationships and in her ability to experience achievement. As well as voicing her feelings to figures from her past, a significant component might also be for Fiona to voice any critical feelings towards me, or at least to be able to disagree. And I would be actively looking for opportunities to support this. Having been so consistently positive towards me, idealizing me, for her to find the courage to disagree could represent a symbolic step towards an independent sense of herself as other, and it would support her readiness to separate, to end the counseling. Now let's see what happens when we arrive at the final session. Well, here we are. It's been about, how many sessions is it, six, six sessions since we first raised the ending, and this is the day. What's it like today for you? 

00:36:40
FIONA It feels a bit unreal, really. I just, you know, it's a bit like, 'cuz we've been here in this situation so often, it's a very familiar situation and here we are back in a familiar situation, and it's not the same because it's the last time we're gonna meet up. 

00:36:55
RACHAEL CLYNE But looking back to six weeks ago and how it felt then, how are you feeling today? 

00:37:00
FIONA I feel all right. I mean, I feel, um, I feel a lot freer. There aren't so many, um, I suppose, shadows, you know, past shadows. 

00:37:25
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, we've done quite a lot of working through those memories that came up for you around ending. 

00:37:30
FIONA Exactly. And so those things are sort of not there anymore, so that makes this, uh, more of a unique event in its own right. 

00:37:40
RACHAEL CLYNE How would you describe the event today, then? 

00:37:40
FIONA Um, I suppose, um, it's important, it's an important time, an important thing that we're doing, and it's something that I, I'm ambiguous about because I, you know, it still can be really sad. It's still sad, isn't it, saying goodbye to somebody, somebody who's been in your life for such a long time and, you know, it, so I, you know, there's sadness, but it's not like that sort of, um, kind of just stultifying sadness that just kind of holds you down and keeps you just immobile. 

00:38:25
RACHAEL CLYNE Are there any other feelings there as well as sadness? 

00:38:25
FIONA Well, there's a bit of a sort of, "Yippee!" in there as well, but I don't know exactly where that's coming from, you know? 

00:38:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Yeah, what does that feel like, that "Yippee!"? 

00:38:35
FIONA Well, it feels a bit like, um, I suppose it, yeah, it's a sense of having achieved something, uh, having gone through something, having worked hard at kind of getting to know myself better, with your help, obviously, of course, you know, that we've both kind of worked on this creative project which is all about me freeing, freeing me up to be more me, I suppose. 

00:39:05
RACHAEL CLYNE Right. Now there's an experience of being fully present in the moment. Fiona can feel her achievement, and there's a room for celebration and laughter. And how does it feel to be free and to be you? 

00:39:25
FIONA Well, I mean, I don't think it's entirely, I don't think it's entirely a finished, um, creation. 

00:39:30
RACHAEL CLYNE Is it ever? 

00:39:30
FIONA No, ‘cuz that would be awful, but it, it, there is a sense of like, "Yeah!" you know, I've 

00:39:40
RACHAEL CLYNE You've done it! 

00:39:40
FIONA I've done it. You know, 

00:39:40
RACHAEL CLYNE You're graduating. 

00:39:40
FIONA I'm graduating, that's right! And, um, I suppose the, the hard thing is to, is to let go of you, really, because, you know, you've meant so much to me, and your, you being you and who you are has enabled me to, well, do all the, you know, exploring and be honest things that I've, you know, look at things that I was scared to look at and didn't even know existed in, in me. And so, you know, I feel like, um, 

00:40:20
RACHAEL CLYNE And what are the qualities, are there any particular things about me that have meant a lot to you? You talked about honesty and being able to look at yourself. Are there any others? 

00:40:30
FIONA Well, just that you always seemed genuinely pleased to see me. 

00:40:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Right. 

00:40:40
FIONA Okay? And I completely got that. 

00:40:45
RACHAEL CLYNE And it's funny how those little things can be so, so important. 

00:40:45
FIONA And, um, you aren't, but you're very sensitive to me as well so that you, you, you very quickly knew how far, for example, uh, to, the, that sense of humor is really important to me. And so you weren't kind of prissy about that, you know? 

00:41:10
RACHAEL CLYNE So a sense of humor's been important to you, and my being genuinely pleased to see you's been important to you. 

00:41:15
FIONA Completely. And, and, and that idea of the fact that, I don't think at any stage you ever imposed any of your ideas on me or any of your feelings on me. 

00:41:25
RACHAEL CLYNE Gosh. 

00:41:25
FIONA Or, you know, I mean 

00:41:30
RACHAEL CLYNE That's really nice to hear. Thank you, Fiona. It's, for me, as a counselor, it's important to hear that ‘cuz I, I do hold that important. It's your space, and it's, you know, it's your experience that's important. And my jo is to return you to yourself, as it were. 

00:41:45
FIONA Yeah. And so there's this sense of kind of adventuring together and that occasionally when things got very big, you know, when the, it all goes kind of… That's huge. 

00:42:00
RACHAEL CLYNE When things are very intense. 

00:42:00
FIONA Then you were, you weren't afraid to acknowledge the intensity or the, the bigness of it. 

00:42:10
RACHAEL CLYNE So I was willing to go with you where you wanted to explore. 

00:42:10
FIONA Yeah, and you never tried to kind of, you know, rub it better, do you know what I mean, that sort of, "Oh, never mind. It'll brush off when it's dry," which is just essential when you're working through stuff with somebody. 

00:42:25
RACHAEL CLYNE Thank you. Thank you very much. And I don't know about you, but I have this fantasy as a counselor that part of my job is to maybe model qualities or enable a, somebody to take those qualities away with them, and I'm wondering, what are the qualities in you that you feel you're now gonna go away with, maybe that you weren't so in touch before, didn't recognize? 

00:42:55
FIONA Right, okay, um, I think number one is, um, not being, um, not kind of retiring, not running off. You know, being 

00:43:10
RACHAEL CLYNE Premature endings? 

00:43:10
FIONA Well, I guess, but no, but more like kind of being really up front and trusting in myself. You know, that sense of sort of, okay, you know? It's like, if that's how you see it, that's how you see it, and that's just right for you, and that's who you are, and you are as important as anyone else. 

00:43:25
RACHAEL CLYNE That's really lovely to hear you say that. 

00:43:25
FIONA You know, so I suppose I call it standing up for myself. And I get that from you because your sense, I get that sense of your being here, you know? 

00:43:40
RACHAEL CLYNE And maybe affirming that in you, affirming that ability in you. 

00:43:45
FIONA Yeah, and, you know, that is fine, whoever you are and whoever you're being is, you know, ultimately fine. 

00:43:50
RACHAEL CLYNE This approach of completing the relationship through appreciations and naming of qualities seen in the other is one often used in transpersonal approaches. Qualities represent archetypal aspects of the self such as love, truth, beauty. My aim here is two-fold. One, to allow the client to voice what the relationship has meant to her, and then to invite her to see if she can appreciate some of those qualities in herself, to recognize what she's taking away within her that will not disappear or be left behind. Okay. Fiona, I, can I say some things in return? 

00:44:40
FIONA Uh, ooh. 

00:44:40
RACHAEL CLYNE Well, I see that as part of completion. 

00:44:45
FIONA I think you're right, yes. 

00:44:45
RACHAEL CLYNE Yeah, if that's okay with you. I mean, I, I think you've been very courageous. You've allowed yourself to be vulnerable. And you've stayed with it even though there've been times when it has been very scary for you, very intense. And I think just staying with it and coming even when it's most uncomfortable, that takes a lot. And the fact that you're saying now that you feel you can trust yourself to stand on your own feet and to trust your own experience. That shows me that, yeah, you're ready to go out there. And, you know, it feels like I've done a good job when, you know, to hear you say that. That's part of my job is to enable you to be yourself as you want to be and to trust your experience, not necessarily to look to me. And I really want to acknowledge you for that. I see the process of completion as a mutual one, a closure between two people and of the roles we've held. So I need to voice my feelings too, to give feedback and hand back my experience of the client. In this session, Fiona's comments were positive, but it's equally important to allow for any unfinished business, any negative feedback that may remain. If it hasn't been raised beforehand, I will, in the final session, ask clients if there's anything that hasn't worked for them. Sometimes this can be revealing. Clients may have perceived criticism, felt annoyed, rejected, or felt critical themselves, yet hidden those feelings from me. Without a balanced closure, there is no real completion, and if I were to have done anything differently in this session, I might have tried to demonstrate this point. And, um, yeah, it is sad to say goodbye. But it, it's a different kind of feeling when you feel you've done the job. 

00:46:50
FIONA You, yeah, you're quite right. And it is just like, um, I just feel this tremendous amount of kind of just love and affection towards you, just being you. 

00:47:10
RACHAEL CLYNE I really thank you. 

00:47:10
FIONA At this point. 

00:47:10
RACHAEL CLYNE I thank you, and I would just like to offer you the opportunity of seeing if you can feel that love and affection for yourself now, the love and affection that you've come to know and come to be in touch with and to just allow yourself to fill yourself up with it for you. 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:47:45
RACHAEL CLYNE And you look really, your eyes are just glowing, face is just glowing right now. I don't know how you're feeling inside, but you look great. 

00:47:50
FIONA Well, thank you. Kind of more relaxed, really. 

00:47:55
RACHAEL CLYNE Okay, well, the dreaded moment is arriving. 

00:48:00
FIONA Yeah, not so dreaded now, actually. 

00:48:00
RACHAEL CLYNE Good. 

00:48:05
FIONA There's nothing dreadful at all. 

00:48:05
RACHAEL CLYNE I'm really glad to have met you, and I really wish you well. 

00:48:15
FIONA Well, thank you. Thanks for everything and just, well, thank you. Thank you. 

00:48:25
RACHAEL CLYNE Thank you. 

00:48:30
[sil.] 

00:48:35
RACHAEL CLYNE Again, this comes from my psychosynthesis training. Evoking the opportunity for the client to really experience love for themselves, to be touched by their own being. Assagioli, the founder of psychosynthesis used the term "projection of the sublime," giving a transpersonal slant on the issue of positive transference. In this instance, the idealization represents the self, and that gets projected onto the counselor. The counselor then endeavors to return this projection so the client can reintegrate this experience of themselves. It's an act of returning of returning Fiona to herself. In this way, an ending session can provide a possibility for a moment of self-realization, for the I-Thou Relationship to be fully felt. It's a real gift and a part of the privilege of being a counselor. My secret hope is that clients be blown away by the depth of who we are. Either way, both parties can now separate with a genuine sense of completion.
