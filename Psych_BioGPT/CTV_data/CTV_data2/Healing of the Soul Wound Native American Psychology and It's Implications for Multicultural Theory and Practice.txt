Root Presented at the National Multicultural Conference & Summit January, 2007 Seattle, Washington Introduction by Allen Ivey 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  Peace be with you. It's an absolute honor to be with you today and introduce ah, Eduardo Duran and Maria Root. Ah, I've, my wife and I were counting up ah, about how many conventions I perhaps have attended. My first one is APA(ph) in 1960 and I now realize I've probably attended something in the order of a hundred conventions. And ah, what I've learned from those conventions I think is really important. One, is that counseling and psychotherapy, psychological practice is going to United States, is basically obsolete and needs to be changed. Ah, we need to come from a new foundation and ah, with lots of important things that happened. As I start looking to her, who's gonna build this new foundation? Ah, Teresa LaFromboise of Stanford was very instrumental in the early stages. Ah, Thomas Parham's recent book on African-American psychology, is really critical; and Edward Duran's, Eduardo Duran's Native American Postcolonial Psychology and his more recent book on the Soul Wound are basically the basis of a new paradigm for the future. So, we have here really groundbreaking work. What's interesting is Brown(ph) groundbreaking work based in a strong, spiritual tradition. One(ph) in(ph) this(ph) 2.19 connected to the land(ph) but also draws on superior scholarship and I am really thrilled to present Eduardo to you. Just a couple words, ah, beyond that is that ah, he is currently Director of Health and Wellness at the United Auburn Indian Community. He's responsible for creating a culturally competent systemic health and wellness program. Activities include clinical social justice and language and cultural revitalization and consultation of local state, national and international agencies. The multiplexity mentioned by ah, (inaudible ) early today in many things from many directions and you're going to hear some powerful suggestions from Eduardo. Ah, to keep my introduction short, because we wanna hear from him not from me, Dr. Maria Root ah, is a person, by the way I, I dearly love both these people. Ah, warm, kind, effective ah, dynamic people. Dr. Root is a trainer, educator and public speaker on the topics of multiracial families, multiracial identity, cultural competence, trauma, workplace harassment and disordered eating. She's provided lectures and training in New Zealand, England, Netherlands, Canada and United States from major universities, professional organizations, grass-root community groups and student organizations. And she does all that, working basically in private practice. In other words, this is a person that puts her mouth where the world is ah, she puts her mouth where the money is. We see her conducting this private practice. Ah, people that can write like Eduardo and Maria and communicate with the world and still work individually are very rare. Let's thank them both. Let's have Eduardo. (applauding) 

00:03:55
EDUARDO DURAN  Yeah, my name is ah, Eduardo Duran and ah, and I also have a spiritual name that I usually, only give in ceremonies and ah, but this is a ceremony and I feel compelled to do that because the conference is an identity. And ah, my spiritual name is "Tioshpae(ph) Woapea(ph)," okay ah, which ah, translates into a "healer at the camp" and ah, I'm Apache(ph) and tewa(ph) and through the Hunca(ph) way(ph) amasula(ph) kuta(ph). The Hunca(ph) way(ph) meaning ah, making of a relative in an Indian way when you adopt somebody you become one of, one of the people, you are no longer just who you thought you were. And ah, the reason I give that ah, identification is that ah, over the years I, I like to ask clinical people a real simple question and it's the only non-rhetorical thing I'll say today. And that's ah, who are you? And you can answer that to yourselves. And if you, if you don't have a good answer then ah, you shouldn't be seeing people. Because ah, a lot of people that we see don't know who they are and that's the main task is, to take them to where their soul is.

EDUARDO DURAN  I don't talk very fast ah, I went to a couple of other talks today and ah, and people talk pretty fast here and ah, reminds me ah, there is one of the psychologist when I was working in our (inaudible ) doing a Wexler(ph) with a young Navajo girl and ah, the grandma was sitting there and the grandma couldn't speak ah, word of English and she's doing you know, one subtest after the other and when ah, they left, the, the grandma told ah, one of Navajo speakers in the clinic, she says, "I, I bet you that woman can make a lot of tortillas." (laughing) And that was her assessment of the psychologist and (laughing), which, which says a lot. I wanna start also with a uhm, quote from the ah, Tibetan Book of the Dead. It says that "The wrathful deities represent hope, and the peaceful deities represent fear. Fear in the sense of irritation, because the ego cannot manipulate them in any way. They are utterly invincible, they never fight back. The hopeful quality of wrathful energy is hope in the sense of a perpetual creative situation, seen as it is, really is, as basic neutral energy which constantly exists, belonging to neither good nor bad." And, most of ah, what I've written about in the, in the clinical work that I do ah, I need to acknowledge the ah, the lineage also that was passed on to me ah, from uhm, a lot of ah, holy people but specifically, one person, that when I was going to a graduate school. I thought he was gonna be uhm, a, a patient and he actually became my teacher. And I really appreciate one of my sister over here ah, said about ah, some of the ah, difficulties of ah, of, of working in an Indian country and I really have to admire and respect her for ah, for humility coz ah, that's a rare thing. A lot of times, interns come and go and ah, and, and they don't get it and, and she got it and so I really wanna acknowledge her in, in a good way ah, like that and ah, so, thanks. And ah, the way that it worked out is that that, ah, this(ph) gentleman, uhm, was paralyzed ah, from the neck down and ah, uhm, the ah, community health worker keeps telling me that ah, this gentleman wanted to see me. And at that time I thought well, he probably wants some of my wonderful cognitive behavioral and behavioral work because at that time I was a radical behaviorist. I just gotten out of the military and ah, I walked around with Science and Human Behavior by B.F. Skinner and I thought that the cognitive behavioral types were wimps and so that's ah, how distorted my way was, until I encountered ah, this gentleman. And in the very first interaction with him, he basically ah, ah, totally cracked my cosmic egg and ah, and led me on a whole other path that uhm, it became really frightening, both frightening and also interesting at the same time over the next three years that I was working on a Ph.D. and doing internships and having supervisors that I couldn't possibly tell them what I was seeing ah, that other people weren't seeing because of what ah, Clarence(ph) was ah, doing to me. And ah, and, and that became the ah, the seeds of the work that I do and I continue to do ah, un, until this day. And ah, and it's just part of the dream that keep dreaming(ph) itself and the dream that's dreaming(ph) us right now. And so, it's unnecessary to say a whole lot more about that and ah, ah, the time when the ah, Cree people invited me up to Northern Canada to do this talk and they gave me two weeks to do it. And they prepared a ah, a ah, a special place for it with fire and all of the elements were present and so to today, we'll do the best that we can. Ah, identity it is one of the more, most critical things I think in the, in the work that we do ah, and as, as I was thinking and listening to some of the things that transpired ah, this morning in talking to people in the hallway ah, talking about wounded soul and ah, I, I've written about it and uhm, I, I realized more and more (inaudible ) a time that the soul of all of us, those of us who still maintain that there is such a thing, has been wounded by the very tasks that we're asked to do and so we do carry ah, some ah, intergenerational trauma ourselves from just doing what it is that we do because the ah, socializing process, the socialization that we go through to get a Ph.D. or whatever are the kind of degree is a lot of times very dehumanizing. And when you dehumanize somebody, ah, you hurt them and when you hurt them, ah, this is an act of ah, not only traumatizing but I also characterize this ah, as an act of sorcery and ah, sorcery can only be, be carried out by people who have special powers in that area and most, well all of us in here by the virtue that's vested in the degrees and everything that we study and we have power. And ah, and the words that we have, have a lot of power. So, it's really important that we really, really ah, look at ourselves that way. Some of the ah, root metaphors of what we do are based right in the ah, words that we used to identify ourselves ah, I've heard several people today identify themselves as a psychologist and ah, some people are psychotherapists and uhm, we don't need to go very far to, to realize that the roots of our identity are really close to the traditional roots of ah, like what my sister had discovered that they're working on a Crow(ph) Agency when ah, the medicine people, the traditional healers came into the hospital, we're, we're really close except we don't know we're really close and, and that's ah, what I'm hoping that we can heal that gap ah, in, in the, in the very near future. It's interesting coz usually I'm, I'm seen as the bad guy and all this but ah, my sister here and uhm, and Allan(ph) ah, they, they did it, I mean, when he said, "You know it's all useless," up to now it's like I, I used to ah, say things like that and people thought, "He's just an angry Indian because he thinks that the way, way of the modern psychology psychotherapy is, is not working but it's really refreshing to hear other people say that, that it's not working and, it is not, just not working for native people or for people of color and it's not working for human beings in general because as human beings, we have the same spiritual source. We come from the same source and, and it doesn't matter where, where we're from. And it took me a long time and a lot of ah, humbling and humiliating experiences by my teachers ah, to get close to that. I haven't completely grasp it yet but uhm, I'm working on it. It's, it's a work in progress. The, ah, one of the critical things that, and when we talk about cross-cultural work coz ah, I stopped using that word also some time ago but it's, it's, it's useful sometimes. Uhm, because in some of the places that I worked, it's ah, an imply that if you read a certain thing or if you went to a certain workshop, and now, therefore, you were(ph) that. And ah, and nothing can be further from the truth and uhm, the term that I like to ah, to use is, that we need to be able to move across epistemology so, it's a hybridity(ph) of being able to live in a life world that you don't usually live in. And that's asking a lot of ah, of ah, of you all to do but the people that you see, the people of color, the native people that you see in your practice, they're having to do that everyday. Every time they get up, they look in the mirror, they see who they are. When they get out the door, they have to go into another epistemological life world that might not be the one that they prefer to be in but they have no choice. And so for at least a little bit of the time that you spend with the folks, I think it would be very, very important for us to be able to, to do that and it's not easy to do. It's not something that you can talk yourself into, it's something that you need to ah, experience. It's just like ah, somebody trying to explain to you what the taste of water is, until you drink it, you really don't know and that's why I really ah, you know, appreciate what ah, the sisters did at Crow(ph). They actually went over there for three months and ah, you know, they, they, they, they got to see what life is about. It would have been really good if you could have been there three years maybe, you know but ah, you're young, you got time. (laughing) The ah, going back to the word psychology, psychologist ah, when we identify as a psychologist what we're saying is that we're student of the soul and all of you Greek scholars in here know that ah, that's the meaning of that word. And usually what psychologists uhm, are supposed to be doing is studying soul and also when we meet with people, we deal with something called ah, psychopathology and we use that term a lot and ah, this basically means soul suffering. So, we are there to alleviate the soul suffering and ah, I wanna take it back to the, to our Greek ancestors because they had ah, they gave us the seeds of where we can, I think, find a common bridge in that and, and the healing of Asclepius. And the, when we, when I talk about this is, is very similar to the events that happened in ah, Indian country when we go see traditional healers and ah, for those of you that don't know ah, the Asclepian god was ah, the Roman god of healing and that was symbolized by a, a fellow with one crutch, with one snake, wrapped around the staff and that was the symbol of uhm, of, of his work. And ah, what would happen here is that when you would go see the ah, the therapist, at, at the Asclepian temple, you present with an offering very much like you do today. Today it's some kind of insurance card and those days were some kind of a honey cake or tobacco or something like that. And then they would take you into an inner chamber. In this inner chamber, they would clean you off with water and steam, pretty much like in the Native American ah, purification ceremonies, wet(ph) lodges(ph) and things like that. And this process was called a catharsis. And a lot of you use that word everyday, you know, when you meet the patient for the first time, you go back into the coffee room and say they catharted(ph) all over the place. So, there was a cleansing happened. And after that, the ah, the priest, the therapist would take the person into a further chamber inside the cave whereas(ph) a stone couch ah, or a little bed and ah, the name of this little stone bed was called a clinic in, in a, in a Greek way. And so then the person was uh hmm, would sit or lay down in this clinic and the priest, the therapist would instruct him to have their healing dream and in a however long it would take to have the healing dream. When they do have the dream, then he would come back to the priest, to the therapist and then the therapist would interpret the dream and the healing would be complete. And uhm, and this is classical Greek stuff and so ah, the reason I even bother to tell you about that is to show that our psyches(ph) are more closely related than, than what we usually think. A lot of the ah, previous ah, research I, on therapy with native people ah, has been a little bit lacking ah, in, in what it does. A lot of articles have been written, a lot of them are fairly stereotypical and not all tribes ah, ah, act in the same way and this has becomes really problematic coz it's over 500, it's about 503 distinct tribes in just the continental United States alone. So, if we wanna be culturally competent within that context that would take ah, several lifetimes to be able to do that. And so in the ah, in the recent book that I wrote, I engage in cultural glossing(ph) and ah, tribal glossing(ph) as I called it and I did that on purpose. It's because they are the commonalities ah, that are more important than the differences. And one of the ah, largest ah, problems that has been a part of a, our communities through the colonizing process is that they had convinced us that we're really different from each other. And in that way, we keep separated from each other. And what I try to tell ah, ah, not only the tribes but all human beings ah, wherever I get to work with them or just visit with them, is to look at the common, ah, denominator in, in all of our psyches(ph) in, in our, in our soul. And it is through that process of moving into the soul arena that ah, that healing can actually happen and uhm, oh yeah, for us as a, a psychologist, as therapists, and you know, in, in quest of, of this thing called soul, it, it is, is critical that we do it through the identity of who we are. Not just in the ah, Fifty-minute Hour for those of you who still have to do that ah, I'm very fortunate that I work for ah, for a tribe ah, today and, and that tribe takes no resources from any governmental entities. And because we take no money from any governmental entities, we get to ah, do things the way we think they should be done. Because we don't have to ah, send ah, reports to ah, to SANSA(ph) or to IHS or to anyone like that. And if a person needs to be seen for four hours that afternoon because they're are in tremendous physical, emotional soul pain, and that is possible. And then, as part of the therapy, we can also do ceremonial things although all of the therapy is a ceremony, but it's possible to also ah, do something as ah, peculiar as, as, as praying with the patient which ah, a lot of people think that that's really, really against the, all the rules and principles and stuff like that. But I think not to do that is really against, against the rules. And ah, so I'm ah, I'm very blessed that at this point in my life, I'm able to do that and uhm, uhm, doing the ah, psychoanalatic, analytic, peek at the watch here, coz I only got a couple of minutes. And I'll be saying a little more about this tomorrow, is that it's really important in that cross-cultural work to change or to move into a different metaphor. The metaphor hasn't changed for the patient. It's only gonna change for you as a clinician. The patient is living in the metaphor of their life world. And ah, a, an example of this is uhm, for instance, if somebody comes to you with ah, addiction problems. Yeah, you can go into the DSM a nd you can look up ah, you know, all the numbers and all the categories for, for addiction but for the ah, native patient, even the most acculturated native people that I have worked with, that does not make any sense. And a lot of times, the acculturation, ah, or what appears to be acculturation is, is basically a barrier of living in a, in a white world. And so, a lot of times there's a lot. of pretensen Ah, people pretend to be something they're not and with very little effort, ah, you can break through and then there's their identity as a, as a native person. And ah, instead of saying you are, or usually they tell me their diagnosis coz a lot of our, our people have been in a mental healthp(ph) system so by the time I see them, ah, as soon as they tell me their name or even before they tell me their name, they tell me their diagnosis. So, they'll tell me, "I'm in major depressive disorder, that's why I came here to see you," and I usually respond by saying, "What did your mother call you? You know, because ah, that's not your name." And ah, and then we go from there and so whether it's an addictive disorder, instead of sayi ng you are addicted, ah, well, maybe you're being visited by the spirit of alcohol or the spirit of meth or the spirit of whichever ah, ah, medicine. And instead of referring to it as a drug, refer to it as medicine because in a traditional native world view, all of it is medicine and it's all part of the, part of the dream time and that puts the patient in a totally different ah, realm in the therapy, coz now they're, they're free to understand what's ailing them in a way that is gonna make it possible for them to either let it go or to obey or to make peace with it and still have a peaceful life because, and not all the ah, disorders that ah, that we treat, are gonna go away or gonna get better. I mean, I hate to tell you that. You know, even with the best ah, therapy you are, or the best psychotropic medication, ah, life is suffering and ah, one of our other ancestors on the other side of the ocean has said that a long time ago. And, and that's something that, that's, that's a great gift to give people like my sister here was talking about the profound suffering at, at Crow(ph) Agency and most of that communities that I worked with are going through similar suffering and there's no way I can take it away. There's no way that I can make ah, the physical environment or erase the historical trauma. But what we can do is we can help them find a meaning within that, to where, within the identity, they can find a place within their soul where they can relate back to creator, to the source of, of soul itself and ah, early on ah, when I was uhm, just starting my Ph.D. program ah, I was ah, "by Niche(ph)" that really, really turns around for me, and where he said that the most wretched things(ph) there is, is suffering without meaning. And then Kao(ph) Yung(ph) very cleverly said that ah, A neurosis, in those days neurosis was a name for probably all of that, is a substitute for legitimate suffering. So, a lot of times ah, we need to really stay with the suffering that the person is, is going through and find meaning through that and in that way, they can cross over coz my teacher ah, Clarence(ph) ah, he, he died ah, on the third year of our training on the 19th of June, ah, that's the first time that he lectured me coz up to then it was three years of aggravation with him, Coz everything he would say to me sounded like a (inaudible )and he laughed at me extensively. And so , he went into the spirit world in a, in a very sacred manner telling me that none of it really has to make sense to you. Just like when you interpret a dream for a patient, a lot of times they don't tell you if that interpretation worked or if it's a true one or not. And uhm, uhm, I only got about ah, a couple of minutes. So, in being able to move into the patient's metaphor is really, really the most critical thing that I, that I can offer you today. So, if the patient doesn't believe in major depressive disorder , try to find out what it is that they understand, that is, whatever is bothering them coz they're seeing you for, for some reason. And if you persist in diagnosing in that, in that Western way then you're colonizing the patient all over again and uhm, I coined a term ah, in, in this latest writing and ah, and then you'll be practicing clinical racism. And I know that's kinda of a harsh word but whenever you impose your world view on someone, through the power that you have, by being a professional provider, then you're practicing ah, clinical racism and it makes you a perpetrator. And I know that's kinda harsh. Indian way, we would call that ah, bad medicine. We would call it sorcery. So when you're involved in that, then you are becoming a sorcerer. And being a sorcerer has its own karmic ramifications and, and life ah, you know, won't go well for you or for the people that you're seeing and a lot of burnout in those type of things that a lot of our relatives in the field experience ah, I believe come from that sort of activity where we practice sorcery and sorcery always goes in a complete circle. We can, to use a jargon that native(ph) he can shoot the medicine into somebody but it always keeps going and that, and that he eventually will find you. And uhm, I do ah, apologize that the, you know, I don't have a lotta anymore time to, to get into depths into this. Tomorrow, we talk a little bit more about it and ah, you know, that's for now, this, this much I wanna say at this time. I really appreciate the, your being here and your kindness and ah, and your ah, politeness in listening to some really, really crazy stuff that ah, you probably haven't heard ah, other places but ah, that's kinda where I'm at. Thank you. (applauding)

MARIA ROOT  Thank you, Dr. Duran. And welcome, welcome. I imagine by this time, people are starting to think about lunch ah, little rest. Uhm, I really am not going to be able to do justice to all of the things that Dr. Duran has just started to touch upon. So, I will, I will do my best. I, I think my mind is also filled with having read his recent book, "Healing the Soul Wound," a beautiful, beautiful teaching book. I, I recommend it to everyone. Wonderful material to learn from, that he really brings alive where he has only been able to touch upon. So I'm going to combine some of what I read from your work with what you've said today and, and uhm, with time, hoping there's time left that there may be some questions then directed towards, towards you. Uhm, I would start by saying, what if our credentialing process required us to accomplish what Eduardo has put out, that we have to know who we are, that we have to really have some contact with, with soul, with the Divine, whatever you wanna call it but there has to be really some contact which means we have to be sort of transcendent in some ways. And what if we had to also have gone quite a ways(ph) towards really acknowledging our wounds at a soul level which means transcendence of time and across ancestors and start of that healing process which then would mean a lot of us would still be in school. Uhm, it would, it would be a very, very different credentialing process and that he has not discredited that the technical information we need to learn, but in the, in the wisdom of age, that uhm, has come to see that many of that technical things we learn only work with certain people some of the time. And that it becomes incumbent on us if we are truly going to become effective healers or to think of ourselves even as healers to be able to code-switch. We're not really taught that in school. We don't necessarily get that in supervision, uhm, and by code-switch, I mean being able to move across epistemological systems. So- 

00:30:50

00:30:50
MARIA ROOT - what I ask you to, to do is follow me on a, a couple examples that I, I've uhm, been, I was part of ah, evaluating people or, or a uhm, preview to uhm, the healing that, that took place and I wasn't the healer. And there, what that did for me coming from a traditional training program and how I had to switch ways of thinking and then how confusing that got uhm, so I will, I will start, I will start with an example. I used to do evaluations for the Federal Public Defender. And often times, they were cases in which a downward departure, that is a lighter sentence was being sought uhm, due to mental health reasons that had truly compromise the individual. And I usually wasn't dealing with sane or insane but ah, some other things and that will get to the labeling identity process. But I was asked one time to evaluate a young Filipino man who was like 23 years old, born in the Philippines, raised primarily here. Uhm, his mother ah, had come with him and he had a sister and they lived just north of here. And the reason he was being evaluated was that he had stolen a car and so was, was sitting in jail and had a very, he, there had been no record of anything on him, no juvenile offenses, no arrest for anything. He'd seem like a pretty law-abiding ah, citizen but the Federal Public Defender uhm, that I often times worked with at the time, in a previous, incarnate, she had been a social worker, and so she really had this ability to be very good at figuring out maybe he would really benefit from some mental health services. So, I was to evaluate this young man and I sit in the room with him. So, those of you, so, okay, scribbling, scribbling my notes and very soon in the interview I can see that he is listening to someone else that I don't see. Okay, so now what I want you to do is go back and forth in systems. The system were trained in conventionally. He's hearing voices, okay. Now, I also want you to try to make a shift to thinking there's a possibility that he may be hearing voices that may actually be there and how might you reconcile that? Because that's gonna go into what Dr. Duran is talking about, you have to sort of figure out what the person's system of causality is and you can't assume that by their station in life on what you assume about acculturation. So, there's different ways you go about finding out about this, and he gives beautiful examples in his book. He talks about Colombo-type questions or you ask the obvious sort of silly question and summating(ph) the information you get. So, I asked this young man, "Is, are there ah, other beings here with us?" "Oh, yes." " Well like how many are there in the room?" You know, and he's like counting. I go, "Okay that doesn't matter. Uhm, who, who is talking to you now?" He goes, "It's an angel." And I go ah, "And what is the angel telling you?" But he tells me first the angel's name, and then he starts talking really quickly and eventually, I have to put the pen aside because there is no way I can take notes at that clip. So he's talking very, very rapidly and I'm trying to switch back and forth between systems but some of what the angels are telling him, really it's a language of liberation psychology. "You have to be very careful of whom you listen to and what they think is wrong with you because they can't always tell and they can't always see it. Okay, if we go to the conventional model, okay, it sound crazy. But given how I grew up, I'm, I'm thinking well. Okay. So, what else are they telling you? And he goes, well, they've been very kind to me and my, they talk to my mother also. Okay. So, we looked at family history of relatives who, uhm, have this going on also. And then, he interjects that, uhm, I guess part of that why he was picked up is, he had, ah, stolen a car and he told me that for a few seconds, he was the luckiest, uhm, guy alive. Because he, this car had gotten him to the state border, the state border is like five and a half hours away, in two or three seconds. (crowd clapping) And what a gift? Okay, so I'm going back and forth and asking, "Well, so, what relevance is that now to what the angels are telling you? And he goes, "Well, nothing really." So, we continue on and I realize my dilemma now, as I listen to him, it's actually, it's not all, ah, crazy. It really is some sense out of what he's saying and I, I, I, now I'm going to have to write this up on a report. And in order for the port, report to have some credence and give him some assistance and really give him the downward departure he probably really needs, I'm going to have to be very careful on how I couch(ph) my findings. That yes, he, he does have some disturbed process going on. He does have racing speech and racing thoughts, but it is possible that these beings were talking, talking to him really quickly and there were multiple ones trying to get his attention. And he was trying to convey the information to me because I was fairly ignorant. And I don't know much about Gabriel and Michael and all these Christian angels. So, he was just sort of exasperated, uhm, but the Colombo-type questions, "Well, tell me what does, what's that angel responsible for and when do they show up?" And it, that didn't sound that crazy? So, I, I wrote the report. I was able to, uhm, kinda figure how to say some of the things and not just say there's some cultural stuff going on because there were, there were different things going on. And when I looked at where his family came from in the Philippines, it was one of the tribal cultures which is totally infused. Besides the, being colonized by Christianity is totally infused as a polytheistic, uhm, group. And that, you make offerings. You make, you negotiate with the angels. And if you don't do that, bad things happen to you. So, the second one I, I offer you is I was visiting a family in the Philippines in the mid-80s and, uhm, I had come across the work of Doctor, Father Jaime Bulatao, uhm, who was really marginalized, ah, at the University of the Philippines because he did a lot of his writing on the Psychic phenomenon. And as a colonized people, people want, in the Philippines, particularly in the academic institutions, absolutely want to be seen as valid particularly in Western eyes. But I really wanted to meet this man. And my aunt who, uhm, was chaperoning me, even though I was over 30 years of age but it's a chaperone culture. Uhm, so she took me to U.P. to see this psychologist father, doctor. And, uhm, he was very, very generous and he gave an example of a young woman that was brought in by the nuns. She's was like high school age. Because all of a sudden she started speaking in tongues. I mean that's very common in the Philippines that the affliction is gonna come in speaking languages, tongues, hearing things. So, uhm, they brought him to, they brought her to him and he talks to her, takes a history. And then, he starts to ask the names according to their religion as there's either seven or eight spirits. And so, he calls them. He calls them out. And then, he goes, there's still, It doesn't get to all of them. uhm, ask her who's left and she gives one more. And he knows there's one more missing that she hasn't named. And he goes in, where is, and I can't remember coz I don't know these spirits, uhm, and she offers that one up. And the language, talking in languages stops. Very different treatment. So what he did is he went with the epistemology of cause, causality. Uhm, even though she was in a very privileged private school, so her family had money, her family would have been very acculturated, but knowing what runs deep, you can acculturate. But when it comes down to it and your distress, it's amazing how much of what is original stays with you. So, these are just two examples in terms of, if we hear them through the lens of conventional psychology, diagnosis, treatment, or me talking these things. I join you as being seen as crazy. But we know we aren't. And many people that we treat aren't really crazy but they are made crazy by the epistemological system not fitting them. So, their voices become invisible. The realities are invisible. So they as people are invisible. And in that situation, and with our insistence on imposing the system we learn is we are really, we are the colonist. We are the, ah, I don't even know that this is even as good as a sorcerer. But we, uhm, we aren't doing any service to ourselves or, or anyone else. So, I think it is really important to ask people about the Colombo-type questions of why. Why do you think this is happening? Why do you think they're visiting you? Why do you think this has been in your familyfor long, so long? Uhm, Dr.Duran talks in his book about really going back contextualizing in history. So, Psychology then has to become more political, that we have to look at trauma, as something that is transcendent of time, that we carry our ancestors with us, that simple things that may translate to and the wounds, uhm, imposed on our ancestors, we carry those with us sometimes without knowing. So, someone comes to you, something has happened to them and they talk about, how really what it seems like they're very upset about is, uhm, their name, the name of the family has been impugned and this is the greatest harm. And we can do our little cognitive behavioral things and all of that but the person is quite in distress. And that's one of those little windows into the acculturation level and the causality model. That one is not just carrying oneself or one's immediate family. It may be carrying those who have come before and, uhm, those who will come after. So, I think what I'm gonna do is I'm going to, to end there. Uhm, there's so much you offered us that's rich. It's really about us examining how do we gain. We talked about multicultural fluency or multicultural competency. It's not just about understanding a(ph) people comes from here. They historically are affected by such and such traumas, uhm, you know, what the socioeconomic condition, where the groups are distributed in the U.S. but it's, it's really about becoming more aware, competent and fluent(ph) in models of causality and not just symbolically. But I think we actually have to believe. If we do not believe, the person will know it, sitting across from you. And I think that's a very big challenge for us. I think there are wonderful gifts that come from that and that is also then part of our healing ourselves to look at where we become vulnerable, what we came to believe and how and why and that helps us come back to who we are. Thank you. And what the time that's left? A little bit time? Questions for Dr. Duran, I'm gonna just have you come back up.

EDUARDO DURAN  Yeah, I wanna bring your attention to the, ah, picture here when we talk about world views. Here is a metal sculpture but you can see there's pieces of cloth here. There's a bag of tobacco, as somebody, these are prayers. People wrap tobacco in cloth. You see those string of red, these are prayers. And who knows who stopped by here and (inaudible ) reservation asking creator for, for help. And, and it's very real and we are, we have it as the image in front of us. And maybe they are praying for us coz usually when we pray Indian way, we pray for everybody. We-

00:45:25
EDUARDO DURAN - don't just pray for, and we say all, all of my relatives. All my relations, and so here's prayers for us all and I was sitting and saying, you know, I really need to acknowledge that, coz some grandpa, some grandma, some child put this offerings there, on, on our behalf, coz, there is, they're never just for yourself. And so there they are. And so, so, is there a question or? If I have an answer, I'll tell you. If I don't, I'll make one up this morning. 

00:45:55
EDUARDO DURAN Yes, ma'am. Yeah, the that, Yes she said, why did I kinda move away from the term "cross cultural". Ah, at the time that I, I moved away from there is becoming kind of invoked, in, in our profession. And it was used as a very paternalistic type of thing or if you took the units of cross cultural thing in your graduate program, Now you're ready to see all the cultures of the world. And a lot of times people say, "Well what gives you the right then to speak to White culture?" And so I have a Ph.D in White culture (laughing)(everybody laughing). 

00:46:25
EDUARDO DURAN -you know, and so I can say a lot about that. And so at least get a Bachelor's degree in some of the other cultures or at least acknowledge that you might not know. And, and that was the only reason I can have moved away from that. I, I, I was really cranky at that time and, and, ah, coz everybody was upsetting me but I'm, I'm okay now. I, I, I did therapy. 

00:46:50
EDUARDO DURAN Well, ah, I get images of (inaudible ), ah, when, ah, you know, the community revolutionary, ah, I think at Chicago when a, a priest asked them a similar question as to how do I give the community what, what they need versus, you know and so that depends if you're happy being a parish priest or if you wanna be bishop. And so, (laughing) a lot of it has to do with, ah, what are you willing to sacrifice, ah, from, from yourself. Because just a couple of days ago, I spent four hours with a gentleman who is in severe physical pain and you know, he's there in, in his house and he's laying on his bed and, ah, we're dealing with what the pain means from coz the pain is not ever gonna go away. Ah, he has neck, ah, his neck was broken and he has all this plates, you know, steel under(ph). So, what we're doing this, trying to get at the true essence of what that pain is and what the pain is trying to teach him as an entity, as a teacher. And their is no way we could do that in 50 minutes. And for me, to just do 50 minutes and walk out, ah, will be very insulting. And actually, he resisted the treatment for a long time because other therapists did that to him. And when I first started seeing him, that's one of the first things he mimicked. He knew how to mimic, ah, you know, ah, the intro to psychotherapy classes that we do. And he, he told me, he says, if you're gonna sit there and tell me, I know what you're feeling and thank you for sharing that" and he sat exactly how we are supposed to sit and you know, he, it was really quite funny. He said, " If you're gonna do that to me", he says," I don't want you here. ah, go see somebody else." He said, "If you wanna work with me, and work at that level of where I'm going and where I'm at right now. I'm between heaven and hell with this pain." He says then I'll talk with you. And I said, okay, I'll work with you but once I said that means, now I really got to work with him." And it's, it's difficult, like so right now, I'm very fortunate, that I'm working in a place where I don't have this governmental, although most of my life, I worked in places where there are governmental, ah, attachments. And I was, I was able to do it. And just by changing the metaphor, and my sister here put it best, you know, when you write the psyche report, I mean, Am I gonna say, "well, ah, we burnt (inaudible ) and that we did a prayer." So now, you know, we did, ah, you know, we, we did therapy. And there's transitional objects, you know, all of you that know how to do that stuff, so the smoke is the transitional object. And that's how we deal with that. And in, and in, and in the book that, that they, they are referring to, in the sub-text, I, I outlined that for you, so when there's prayer and this object appears, ceremonial objects, you don't need to tell everybody that's what happen. But if the government source needs to know what kind of therapy you are doing, then you can translate that into psycho [inaudible]. And then, they're happy and you're happy. The patient is happy. And everybody wins and you still to keep the funding going. And, I worked in a program once where as part of the, we are getting $50,000 from Alameda county and we're gonna put a sweat light(ph), as part of the prevention program but we needed, ah, certain things. And by that time, they kinda knew me a little bit and part of the deliverables whether we're gonna buy pitchforks and chainsaws and things like that. And when the bureaucrats read the grant and now seeing me across the table, just looked at me and didn't say a word. They wanted to know what the chainsaws were for...(laughing) (everybody laughing)but, but they didn't ask. And there's only one purpose for chainsaw is to cut wood, to make a fire but, but they weren't out about to ask me that. And we got the money and we bought the chainsaws. We did sweat lodges, and helped a lot of people with it. And so it's a matter of being able to travel in that metaphor. And one of the first things that I asked the people that I see in therapy is that do you want to do this, Indian way or the White way or in between? So, there's a lot of choices. If they wanna do cognitive behavioral and we do some of that and we do some Indian stuff. We do some spiritual stuff and keep that fluid(ph) for them. And not a single patient in this whole time has ever said, they want to do it the White way. And, ah, but if they want to, I can do that, and (inaudible ) you know we'll have PhDs, and yes sir. 

00:51:10
EDUARDO DURAN If you, if, if you have a genuine call for it, because other wise, I like my sister said, "if it's not real, people are gonna pick up on it." and for those of you who come from the Judeo-Christian Tradition and Vision Quest would entail that you fast for 40 days coz I know Moses and Jesus Christ, that's what they did. So, the, the bar(ph), is a lot higher than the Indian way we only do it, (laughing) we only do it for four days. (laughing) It's a lot more humane, but if you're gonna follow that path, that's a really rough one, coz 40 days on a desert, God Bless you, Man. And you know (laughing) 

00:51:45
EDUARDO DURAN And I kinda touch that and I'll talk a little bit more about my teacher tomorrow Clarence(ph). In a very first interaction with him, I, I almost passed out and this is serious. I mean, I'm telling you the truth. He, he was laying on a bed. He's a, he's, he's a skeleton basically and there's bags with body fluids all over on the bed. And the, the very first thing he says to me is don't think that way. There's other realities and I hadn't said anything yet. The intake(ph) hadn't even started. The very next thing he said to me is have you ever seen the colors. And that created extreme anxiety in me. I don't know, At that time I didn't know why. I said, "No, sir. I never seen new(ph) colors." And he says, "You want me to show them to you." And at that point, I almost passed out coz I knew if I would have said yes, he would have shown me something that I was totally unprepared to see. And so that's why, you know, when a brother over here talks about Vision Quest, be careful with that because it's really powerful stuff. (inaudible ) cautions us. He says, ah, "Be very, very careful when you start dabbling(ph) with mythological layer of the psychic(ph) because that's where schizophrenia and all of those things that we know about, that's where they reside." And when you dial those numbers, they're gonna pick-up and say hello. And then, what are you going to do then? Coz, it's real. I mean, the stuff is very real. And, and Clarence(ph), you know, who took me under his wing. He protected me otherwise, I wouldn't be here talking to you coz it, it was a really, really profound and, and very frightening personal process for me as I was letting go. Then, I grew up with, ah, teachings that were of a different kind. So, you know, by having spent six years in the military, I kinda lost my soul. And then, ah, coming back to graduate school, and then meeting Clarence(ph) along side with my regular supervisor. So you can imagine what a distance I was in when I was seeing my supervisors and say, "What, what did you do with patient x, y or z? and I would say, "well if they were in there. The ancestors were in the room." And, ah, I didn't know what to do with him, so I went to Clarence(ph) and, and so, I had to walk a very careful path. And I, I call it "coyote's path" coz you have to be real careful, you know, how you move through those grounds. And I was lucky that I had a teacher and, and don't try this at home by yourself, (laughing) coz it's, it's powerful and, and, all of you have seen the, the effects of what the collective layer of psychic can do and is called "psychosis" or it can be "enlightenment". Thank you very much again and, ah, see you again maybe tomorrow and already, already, if you are already, Okay. (clapping)
