Family Counseling Using Reality Therapy Robert E. Wubbolding, EdD Director of Training: The William Glasser Institute Professor of Counseling Xavier University 

00:00:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  My name is Bob Wubbolding and I'm the Director of Training for The William Glasser Institute. I'd like, I'd like to welcome you to this taping of a ah, discussion of family counseling in the context of choice theory and reality therapy. As a Director of Training for The William Glasser Institute, I'd share the profession development committee, but my full time position is ah, being in the faculty at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, or as they see on television when our basketball teams play X-Xavier University which, of course, aggravates the students no end. Uhm, this is being taped for the class and (laughs) family relations uhm, and I'd like to thank you all for participating in this, uhm. As I said, the Xavier University is in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is the city that, ah, Pete Ross(ph) built and the city that Jerry Springer was smeared off. It's also the city that Roy Rogers and Dolores Stay(ph) were born in so ah, those are some of our claims of fame. Ah, this session today is going to be divided into several segments. I'm going to talk for a while, and then I'm going to have ah, four people come forward and we're going to do a role play simulated demonstration of a family. Ah, I'm going to talk about choice theory which is the underlying theoretical basis in justification for the delivery system reality therapy. I'll talk about that for just a few minutes then I'd like to talk about some of the premises underlying reality therapy applied to families. And then I'd like to talk about the goals of a reality therapy in the context of family counseling. So those ah, elements will become clear as we go along.

00:01:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  The ah, choice theory has been developed and extended by William Glasser. He is a psychiatrist and lives in Los Angeles. I wanna be sure to give full credit to him for developing that theory and for founding the delivery system reality therapy. Uhm, choice theory (Clears Throat) was formally called control theory or control system theory and Glasser extended the ideas, and maneuvered them and changed them around ah, to the point where in 1996 he changed the name of the theory to choice theory because the, the phrase control didn't really fit the, the theory very much ah, as he ah, developed. (Clears Throat) So I'm going to provide a very brief summary of this and encourage you if you're watching this on the video to stop and start to tape periodically to discuss the ideas. I'll suggest when I think the best time is to sug, to stop it and to discuss it. Ah, all right, the choice theory, what is it? (Clears Throat) It's based on the idea that we are motivated inside of ourselves to fulfill five genetic instructions as Glasser likes to call them or needs, and I've listed them very briefly here in a simplified chart. One of them is survival. (Clears Throat) Ah, we are innately motivated and driven, if that's a good word. Ah, innately ah, ah, ah, motivate that I think is the best word to survive. Your body will generate survival behaviors. You perspire or when you're warm, you'll ah, shiver when you're cold, if you get an infection your body will ah, generate a fever to fight the infection, and many other ah, aspects of, of survival we can talk about but ah, I want to keep this simple. Another ah, motivator is belonging inside of us. We have a moti, motivation that drive to be longed, to be involved with people. In fact, this is so important that Glasser is teaching and we, we teach in choice theory that all long term psychological problems are relationship problems so this is a very good place to start when counseling anyone, or in teaching, or in managing and supervising. It's a very good place to start with the relationship that the individual has with other people. Power is the other ah, (Clears Throat) motivator. Power or another word for that is achievement or accomplishment. Self-esteem comes in here, self-worth, recognition. There are many, many aspects of power. Ah, Napoleon once said that he could make men die for a few pieces of ribbon. People will actually die for, for power, or for recognition, or for achievement so it's a very important drive and motivator that we have, and you can see how this gets in the way of some relationships ah, in marriage or in family, or in any kind of ah, interconnection that people have. The fourth motivator is freedom of choices where we have an innate ah, desire, innate ah, ah, need rather to, to make choices (Clears Throat) to, to be free, to be independent, to stand on our own two feet. P. R. Jay(ph) called it autonomy. So there are a lot of aspects of each of these motivators. The last one is the need or the genetic instruction to have fun and this is, of course, connected with learning people enjoy learning. (Clears Throat) So when you learn something ah, you, you are more likely to, to enjoy it and when you enjoyed, you're more likely to retain it. Ah, Maria Montessori once said what is learned through plays they're to stay. In other words if we, if we learn it and it's enjoyable, we're more likely to retain it, not perfectly but, but we're more likely. We also have specific desires or wants related to each of those needs. And when we put all those wants together which has symbolized with this loose circle, it's called the quality world. It's the world you would like to live in. For the sake of simplicity, I would suggest just think of that as your wants, your desires, and the wants that you have which are fairly intents. You have a want related to survival, your want related to be longing, and, and all the others. Ah, so we call it for the, for the sake of simplicity here, your wants or another phrase is the quality world. Ah, now, third point. When we get what we want, it is like a scale that is in balance. If we don't have it, we want it to give in moment. It's like a scale that's out of balance so there, there's a discrepancy between what we perceive that we have and what we perceive we're getting. And, and you probably know people, and especially in marriage and family relationships who have lots of out of balance scales. Something they want from that family, something they want from their partner, something they want from their children, something they want from their parents, and they may not be getting it, and so they have out of balance scales. When you have what you want, it's an in balance scale. We're getting what we want. We exist in a kind of state of homeostasis. We are in balance. And we're never in balance completely because we always want something a little bit more. You won't be longing when you left home today, you won't be longing when you arrived home today. So it's an ongoing kind of, of ah, want that we have related to each of those needs, so you have your needs, your wants, and your scales. When you don't have what you wanted, give it a moment. This little jagged arrow symbolizes what happens. We generate a choice and most behaviors are chosen. Without going into lots of distinctions, my suggestion is always to, to, to think of behavior as if it is a choice even if it may not be a choice specifically about some ah, behavior of this one or that one. Ah, that, that's really not, not my point of emphasis here today. But think of the jagged arrow as symbolizing that behavior is a choice and in counseling if we treat behavior as if it is a choice, we can open up doors for people and they will see implications and possibilities that they didn't see. This is, this little box here symbolizes behavior which is divided into four elements: physiology, feelings, thinking, and action. And each of those can be negative or positive, effective, ineffective, helpful, hurtful, ah, ah, ah, ah, helpful to the people around us, hurtful to the people around us, ah, and so on, so there's a lot of ways to think about this. I have in the book rea, ah, 'Reality Therapy for the 21st Century' about 15 different concepts that relate to effective behaviors and ineffective behaviors. Ah, so, so they're divided, the behavior is divided into physiology, feelings, thinking, and action. And you'll notice the little handle at the top, and that handle symbolizes that this is the handle of the suitcase of behavior and when we change the action, we change everything. So we're going to talk a lot about actions as we've counseled with families or individuals. We're gonna talk more about that than feelings. We're gonna talk more about that than, than thinking. And we're even gonna talk more about that than physiology ah, that would be fairly evident since most people who use this are not uhm, physicians but, but there's a very good question we can ask people in, as we work with them. If they have some aches and pains, a good question is what is your body telling you. What are your feelings telling you if you're depress and angry, and resentful, and shame, and guilty, what is that telling you? Ah, so, so in the same way we're thinking if we have a, a, have a lot of negative thinking about the family members, what, what is that telling you? Does it tells us that our actions are not what they could be and so we're gonna ask people to change their actions. They lift that suitcase by the handle thereby changing the entire compass of behavior ah, which is called total behavior. So the little analogy of the suitcase is very useful. Ah, Glasser likes the analogy of the automobile with the front wheels being action and thinking, and the back wheels being feeling and physiology, and it is those two front wheels that we have most control over. And when you turn the steering wheel on the car, the entire car moves. So this is another way to think of this. Ah, this little arrow symbolizes that all behavior has a purpose and the, so it's not meaningless. It's not inane. It's not ah, aimless. That may seem to be aimless to the other members of the family, to the counselor, to the society at large for sure that perp, person it has a purpose. What's the purpose to impact this outer world so that we get something from the world. And what we want from the world is a perception. You want the perception of what? Satisfying your needs. You want the perception of being involved with people. You want the perception of being somebody who can achieve something who's good at something. You want the perception of having choices. You want the perception of, of having fun. This is why people take drugs. And I've no idea ah, what this family is going to be like there. Maybe somebody that takes drugs and maybe somebody that doesn't, I don't know yet. But ah, I know they've worked it out but ah, they haven't told me any, any details yet. But ah, I, I do know that if there is that issue, people will take drugs because they want the perception. If you, if you, if you go out and have three or four martinis, you'll have the perception of being very popular, right? I won't ask if anybody's tried that but, you know, when you have three or four martinis, "hi, how are you," "oh hi, hi, hi." So you, you can be very popular, you have the perception of, of being more in control, so you can drive your car better after a few drinks. The only problem is it's an illusion. The rest of the world doesn't agree with that and you certainly have less stress and is enjoyable so we have the illusion of satisfying those needs and, and that's the insidiousness of taking drugs is that we, we get that illusion of satisfying our wants and our needs without working at it. And what reality therapy offers is hard work. So ah, I just wanna, do use that example to illustrate that what we want from people and from the world around us is perceptions. That's all we know as our perceptions. So what, what have I said? I've talked about the choice theory and tried to summarize that briefly. Well, (Clears Throat) with by saying we have needs and we want, have wants and we have perceptions, that's the motivational system. The behavior is the output we generate for the world around us so that we get some input from it and what we want from it is, of course, the ah, perception. (Clears Throat) Now of all those four components that I mentioned, the first one being this one over here with the three subdivisions, and then the behavior and the perceptions in the world, which is the hardest to change? (Clears Throat) In a family, certainly it is the outside world. I mean if you're the, if you're the parent, it's very hard to change and control that spouse. If you're the other partner, it's very hard to control that partner or the children. The children have a hard time controlling their parents. But what we can do is control ourselves and that's hard enough, (Clears Throat) but that's the point of this. And so because of the emphasis on the word choice and the idea the behavior is chosen, it is now called choice theory as Glasser renamed it in 1996. Now I would suggest you stop the tape for just ah, a couple of minutes and talk about some aspect of choice theory and ah, perhaps just ah, maybe express your agreement, disagreement, what caught your attention, is there anything new or different, or how does this compare with perhaps what you read. 

00:12:45
Discussion 

00:12:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay, after that ah, very nice discussion, I'd like to talk about the premises underlying reality therapy applied to families and then goals, and then I'll suggest that you stop the tape again and discuss that for a few minutes, and then we'll do the role play. Ah, some of the premises underlying (Clears Throat) the practice of reality therapy applied to ah, families or these, by the way, these are assumptions, and ah, one of them is that the families are composed of individuals and structures. The individual part of this is pretty clear. These are the, these are the individual components: the children, the mother, the father, the grandparents, the cousins, the, the extended family members, whatever it may be. (Clears Throat) The structures are the rules and the expectations that people have, or the norms spoken or unspoken, what is allowed, what is not allowed, but we talk about what we don't talk about, and how we treat each other and all of those. Those are the structures or the connections. Ah, another premise is, premise is that we're going to talk about relationships. We're gonna focus on relationships rather than individual problems. I'm not saying people don't have individual problems, behavioral problems, ah, intellectual problems, ah, all the different things that you can look up in the books that individuals have, but we're gonna talk about the connections that they have with each other when they stress that in reality therapy and in many other kinds of counseling, of course. Ah, we're going to say that reality therapy is not a long term process applied to families. Ah, people come uhm, periodically and they can come per several sessions, and maybe stop and come back, and uhm, ah, some people call, call that serial counseling or serial therapy, and the counselor becomes a fit serial therapist or a serial counselor. I don't know about that phrase but ah, obviously it's not really funny. But (Clears Throat) ah, at any rate, the, the counseling itself is short term so we're just, I suggest think of it that way. Another part of reality therapy applied to families is that the counselor is active. We're not just going to sit there and passively listen. We're going to take an active and a very directive role that it doesn't mean when I've pushed people around or tell them what to do, or hammer on them in any way because you can be very emphatic and use reality therapy ah, at the same time. We're going to, to get beyond ah, listening to how they feel. We're gonna talk about actions. Now an order to about the goals. (Clears Throat) One of the goals of reality therapy applied to families is that the, we're hoping that they will, they, the members, will gain at least a modicum, at least some degree of need satisfaction. They will be able, as a result of reality therapy practice, to, to have some belonging in the family, some power, some freedom. In other words, they will be able to satisfy those five needs, not perfectly, but better than, than they could have ah, by going to reality therapy. Ah, also, we're hoping that they will have a change in their perception. Ah, they, that the perception will change. The, they will see the world differently. They will see the family members perhaps a little bit more favorably. A parent would see the strengths of the child. The child would see that the parent does have some, some positive motives in ah, in the way they deal with, with the children, and so on. So, so we're not gonna do this in a phony way but we're gonna try to help people change how they look at things. Perhaps they see everything from a high level of perception. Then another word is to make judgments about everything. The goal might be to help them lower their level of perception. They kinda see each other ah, in, in a less judgmental critical way. We're also gonna try to teach the concept of quality time, time spent together. Ah, this is a very positive way to build strength in their families. It's very effective to teach family members directly actually uhm, that, that they can get along better if they spend time together for short periods of time in a noncritical way, not talking about past behaviors, not talking about ah, problems, and not criticizing each other, putting each other down, but good solid time for a limited amount of time spent together where they are enjoying each other's company. And so, so this, this is not something that, that I think we should underestimate. Ah, another technique that we'd like to, that I suggest teaching them is ah, what I call the red room. Ah, this is, this is a very simple idea and depends on the, on culture you might wanna, if you're in China, some cultures I would suggest not using the word red room but use a blue room or green. It doesn't matter. I just use RR rise(ph) so that goes together as a kind of alliteration, but whatever you say, a room. And this would be where a few minutes they put their problems in the room and they talk to each other without ah, the hassles that they usually have. They lock the problems away. They set them aside. Whatever technique ah, can be used and, and so this is another old technique to teach people. (Clears Throat) We wanna teach them perhaps the third component and this is ah, one of Glasser's favorite techniques. He calls it the solving circle where you imagine that there's a circle around you as a family, as a couple, whatever it may be, and while you're in this circle, we talk only about solutions to problems. We don't talk about ah, the problems themselves and we talk about only what I can do to make the relationship better. Ah, another goal is, of course, to change behavior. These are sort of process goals what I talked to up till now is about the tools that people can use, but there's also outcome and the ultimate goals, of course, that they get along better. (Clears Throat) So ah, these, the other ah, aspects are the kind of to build up to the real change in behavior. Ah, another goal is to teach the, the participants in the family ah, some of the actual principles of, of ah, the basic principles of choice theory in reality therapy. Number one would be that we have these needs that motivate us that, that we're not driven to do what we do because of past childhood conflicts. We're not ah, just determined by outside forces by the stimuli we get from the world around us. So those are important those, those things perhaps to some extent but we're not gonna focus on them and we're not gonna say that's what overpowers us. We're going to say that we have choices and we're going to teach that to the, to the people. Another aspect is another part of these ah, prin, these principles of reality therapy in choice theory is that we're the only person we can control as ourselves and as I said previously, this is hard enough so we're gonna try to help people understand that they can't control the other person and they can't control their parents, their children. We can reward, we can punish, but let's face it, people will do what they're going to do if they want to do it, and that's what really motivates people. We're going to try to teach them also that ah, behavior is a choice and then help them to use the language of choice theory that ah, when they talk to each other about the choices that ah, that that's ah, that's another kind of a goal that we have to get them to use the language. And then uhm, to, to help them recognize that the problems that they're having, the difficulties, the stresses, the strengths, whatever it maybe, major or minor are usually relationship problems, and so how can you get along better no matter what the presenting issue is. As counselors and therapists, we can always talk about relationships. And when we help people form relationships and intensify them, the other problems can diminish. I don't mean they'll all go away. This is not as simple as I, as it might sound in a, in a 20-minute explanation. Life can get pretty complicated but, but there's a little phrase KIS, keep it simple. And one of the things we can do with this is to try to keep life simple. No matter what the ache, and the pain, and the burden that a person bears, we can help them lighten that burden if they have good relationships or they're working on an increasing and intensifying in some relationship. I don't need to, to try to prove that. I mean literature are balanced with that and uhm, history are balanced with, with issues around relationships. And then, of course, I would strongly suggest that we teach them the fifth ah, principle here which is that uhm, that the use what I, what I formulated as a WDEP formulation, helping people recognize that they can change their lives if they keep that little radio station in mind. What do I want? What am I doing? And was, is what I'm doing helping, that's the E, the self-evaluation, and then what's my plan? Ah, in the book Reality Therapy for the 21st Century, I enumerated 22 kinds of self-evaluation. So it gets a little bit more complicated than just four letters or four questions. It's much more complicated than that. But if we only learn those four questions and use them, that's a big step. Okay, so having said that, what I'd like to do is ask you to turn off the tape for a few minutes, pause, and ah, discuss this for as long as you care to. And ah, when we start to tape again, you will see that the family has miraculously appeared in front of you and with a counselor, that's me, and uhm, we'll see what happens with that role play. 

00:21:40
Discussion 

00:21:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay, this is our family and I don't know very much about them except I'm going to know that they came for counseling, and this is going to be a role play. I'd like to say something about role plays before we start in with the actual session. And one of the values of role plays in the merits of doing this simulation is that in, in this amount of time you can do this amount of work in the sense of demonstrating more than a few techniques and ideas. Ah, so, so the timing of everything I say may not be right, but the purpose of saying these things is to demonstrate what could be done in a real counseling session. I mean that might be right. The, the timing might be perfect. I don't know until it actually happens. Uhm, so another purpose, another idea behind role playing is that ah, I don't like to do real counseling in, in a group and publicly although I've done it. In fact, I've made a few video tapes with real clients, but ah, I don't like to do that unless it's highly controlled and high, and all of the kinds of ah, ethical issues are taken care of ahead of time. Uhm, and, and the, the reason is sometimes ah, families need followup and so on, and that should be provided for. So ah, in, in a real counseling session, the counselor is primarily responsible to the people here. In teaching in a role play, the responsibility is to the people watching it, and so I think there's a little difference in those two things. Ah, also, I'm going to assume that as in any counseling, in any therapy, the issues, the ethical issues have already been handled the informed consent and ah, the forms filled out and all the fees, if you have fees, and all of that has been handled. That's really no different in reality therapy than it would be in any kind of counseling so that's why I don't need to demonstrate that otherwise, you spend 20 minutes demonstrating this or a thing instead of the actual essence of reality therapy. So I just wanna provide that background to the role play itself. Okay, so we'll just start here and ah, I only know that ah, mother has called and ah, so we have mother and, dad, and we have Dolores who's 16, and we have Teresa who's 14, and mother called and said that uhm, there are some problems and some tensions in the family and she, and I didn't really get a chance to say a whole lot to her and she didn't say much to me. I know there's some drug use, and I, and I know maybe a couple of other things, but I don't know a whole lot and this is very realistic that we don't always know much. We, we really don't always know what we're walking into with these things. So, well, everything said that ah, (Clears Throat) mother, you called and talked to me on the phone so... (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...I'm kind of wondering, Dad, what do you think about being here? 

00:24:35
 I think that if she wanted me to come out I gonna come them. 

00:24:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
 You know, she told me that she called you and she thinks that we need to be here. I know that things haven't been great around the house lately, so... (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Nice. 

00:24:45
 ...you know, so here we are. 

00:24:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  So, Dolores what do you think about being here? 

00:24:50
DOLORES  I don't wanna be here. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I see. 

00:24:55
DOLORES I, I know we got some problems but we're not that different than any other family. 

00:25:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
DOLORES I don't know why we need to be here. 

00:25:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well, Teresa, what do you think ah, why do you think you're here? 

00:25:05
TERESA  Mom said that I come so I'm here. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I see. And mother did you, when you called, did you say, "I just can't wait to go to counseling"? 

00:25:15
 No. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING No. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
 I wasn't very happy but I needed to come. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, so this sounds like a very normal kind of family. They come for counseling and aren't really excited about being here. This is interesting, you know. Another thing that strikes me about you already is that you are mostly agreement that you're not thrilled with being here that, that it's kinda like an agreement. You all, all seem to be on the same page with the, with the picture. 

00:25:45
DOLORES Yeah, I don't think anybody likes to come in the counseling. 

00:25:50
TERESA I should. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
 It's nothing we talked about or anything. 

00:25:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Pardon me? 

00:25:50
 It was nothing that we talked about.. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:25:50
 ...we've been reaching them on that but. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
TERESA You know Mom just made us come in here but Dad. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
DOLORES Yeah, she just told us today we had to come. 

00:26:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh-huh. 

00:26:00
 This is the way it usually is. It gets shut off on me. 

00:26:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I see, you get blame. 

00:26:05
 Yeah. 

00:26:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Do you agree with that Dad that mother usually gets blamed. 

00:26:10
 I don't think we blame her. I mean that this was her idea. (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
 I mean that's why we're here. I don't think we've been here unless, unless you bring the call with this. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. But the interesting thing is that you, you all agreed and then once you're here you agree that you're not really excited about being here so there's like two things that you agree on. Not excitedly, I know, but ah, it's interesting. What, what do you make of that kind of consensus? Do you know what I mean by consensus? 

00:26:45
DOLORES Hmm. 

00:26:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You know, people agree. When was the last time you, as a family, agreed to two things? 

00:26:55
 I remember the last time we talked about two things. 

00:26:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Really? (crosstalk) 

00:27:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
TERESA Probably, it's my bad report card, right? 

00:27:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Bad report card. 

00:27:00
TERESA  Well, everybody said it's beyond, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
DOLORES Now, sure it was. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Huh. 

00:27:05
DOLORES  Now how you could just never study, you're not that dumb. (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
TERESA Study all the time. 

00:27:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. Well, tell me about the last time you, as a family, agreed on something that was kind of a positive thing, not a report card that was bad, but you agreed on something that was really, you know, made you feel good. 

00:27:25
  You mean like a decision or just the time when we were all, all right together? 

00:27:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, either way. When you had a good feeling about being a family. 

00:27:40
 Maybe for that hour on Christmas morning. 

00:27:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Christmas morning, yeah, so well, we only got another month to go on, and there'll be another hour, huh? 

00:27:50
  That's reassuring. 

00:27:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:27:55
 It's not like, it's not like we're always odd to each other, though. I mean, I don't, I'm not sure I know what you mean by agreed but, you know, it's not like we're always disagreeable. 

00:28:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  No, but I mean when was the time was, was, so you say Christmas, would that be something where you know that that was really a good feeling you had about being a family is enough. This is a family. Would that be Christmas? What do you think? 

00:28:25
DOLORES Yeah, I, I agree with that... (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:28:25
DOLORES ...and it's a pretty good day actually. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING All the whole day. 

00:28:30
DOLORES Hmm. 

00:28:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Teresa, how about you? 

00:28:35
TERESA Well, I'm pretty good at Christmas. 

00:28:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Did you? Do you remember it was some like pleasant memories? 

00:28:40
TERESA Yeah, I really like the guitar day that mom and dad gave me. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING They gave you a guitar. Do you still have it? 

00:28:45
TERESA Yeah, I ever play it. 

00:28:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Ever play it? 

00:28:45
TERESA Yeah. 

00:28:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You're pretty good at it? 

00:28:50
TERESA I'm learning. My friends are teaching me. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING All right. Yeah, but do you ever play at home? 

00:28:55
TERESA Yeah, in my room all the time... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:28:55
TERESA ...that's when I practice. 

00:28:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm, okay, hmm, okay. Uhm, so you agree that last Christmas was a, a time when you enjoyed each other. Am I right about that? 

00:29:10
TERESA Yeah. 

00:29:10
DOLORES Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Hmm. Okay, it seems like you agree that I'm right about the, why we're planning(ph) lots of agreements here. Ah, now, I wanna ask you another question. What would you like to have happened from this counseling? In other words, for example, let me, be more specific. Do you want me to be someone that helps this family stay together or do you want me to be someone who helps the family kind of break up? This is a pretty basic question. 

00:29:35
  I would like the family to stay together that's why I'm here. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You like the family to stay together, okay, okay. Teresa, how about you? 

00:29:45
TERESA Well, I'm hoping mom and dad pay for college, say I'd like to stay together so we can go, it's like, you know, get me college paid for. (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So you can go to college but... (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
 Is that all we are to her? (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
  I don't know. You know in that, that's kind of like we're this whole thing, you know. We talk about, I don't, I don't know that we're gonna break apart or stay together. But, you know, it's that, that kind of, you know, what, what can you guys do for me? 

00:30:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:30:05
TERESA  Isn't that what parents are supposed to do about? (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
 And it doesn't surprise me that, you know, what she remembers about Christmas was the gift that she got. 

00:30:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:15
 And you know, with other family members over there lots of other really, really good times that happened but it's, you know, it's I think that this is, this is kinda typical what we're dealing. 

00:30:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
 It's whether we have break-aparts or stay together, I don't know but ah. (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Do you want to stay together? 

00:30:30
  Me? 

00:30:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
 Oh, yeah. 

00:30:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, so both do and Teresa for the reason of what will happen and that's good in your mind. What about you Dolores? 

00:30:45
DOLORES Yeah, I wanna stay together. I, I got friends whose parents split up and it's pretty rough, right? (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, it is, it is. 

00:30:55
DOLORES It's better if we stay together. 

00:30:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I mean, I wanna ask you that because I don't wanna assume that everybody, and says oh yeah, we wanna stay together. So is it kind of important to you? I, I said you want to stay together but not when I asked you a slightly different question. Is it important for you to stay together? Or is it something well, you know, it'd be nice but we don't care. Is it important? 

00:31:15
 I think it's important for me to stay together. 

00:31:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:31:20
 I mean I'd like, I'd like my family to take care for each other and not necessarily from just a monetary point of view but to be a family. 

00:31:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
 Ain't that what we're supposed to be? 

00:31:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, if you choose to stay together then you will be a family together. 

00:31:35
  I don't, I mean I don't think it's like we've been talking about splitting apart. 

00:31:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay. Do you haven't heard any talk about splitting up? 

00:31:45
DOLORES Hmm, no. (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Do you have any bond to your mother and dads that I'd like to get the hell out of here? 

00:31:50
DOLORES No. 

00:31:50
TERESA Not for any length just, you know, on the weekends since uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Just all weekends, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
TERESA Yeah, when. 

00:31:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay so, so you'd like to stay together because I, I guess they question and sometimes people say no, no we're gonna split this thing up. So I just want to kinda check that out with you. (Clears Throat) I have another question and, and this is a question just again, it's a slightly different question but there's some similarities here. If, if it's important that you stay together and if you would like to stay together as you already said, ah, how hard do you wanna work at staying together? And do you wanna work out it or, you know, you wanna put in some energies, some efforts, tell me a little about that. (Clears Throat) Let me start with you, Dolores. 

00:32:40
DOLORES Yeah, I've, I've really liked to put a lot into it. Uhm, I feel like all of us have a lot to give and share... (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
DOLORES ...uhm, as long as Teresa goes along with this. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
TERESA  I knew you're gonna say that. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
DOLORES She's a troublemaker. You won't believe some of the things she's been into. 

00:33:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, I would believe it. 

00:33:05
TERESA She never gives me a break, you know, fairly well when you give me a break and I admit that I do some good things. I might be wrong, but I put some effort in. 

00:33:10
 How many breaks do you want? 

00:33:15
TERESA Just like when I came home with a B on my test you said, "Okay, so next time you're gonna get an A". That's not getting a break, that's getting some, some credit for what I did right. Why would I keep on and try when that's the response I get? And I keep getting compared, "Oh, she gets, always gets A's, you should also get A's. 

00:33:30
DOLORES Well, if you'd study more you could get A's. Always in there playing your guitar, I'll beat your friends. 

00:33:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Dad, what do you think? (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
 I, I think she could've got me A's. I mean, you know, she's a bright kid. She's, she's certainly as smart as her sister. Her sister gets A. I think she could do. I don't think it's, you know, I think you asked a good question. How hard, how hard Teresa you're willing to work? 

00:33:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So I asked you how hard you're willing to work and I hear ah, kinda like a criticism of ah, Teresa. 

00:34:05
 I guess it. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
TERESA That's, that's not always is around our house. It always is that way. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
 That's the way it is, Teresa. You can get better grades if you want. 

00:34:10
DOLORES There's no. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
 You can stay home with the family if you want. You know, you're out with your friends, your. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
TERESA  Maybe I would be if people just give me a break. 

00:34:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, let me ask you this question. Do you, do you wanna work hard of this or do you wanna work a little bit its thing to go it? Now let's, let's put them another way. That might be a difficult question. If you have a hundred percent energy that you could put in to staying together, what percentage of your energy would you put into it? Dad? let's start with you. 

00:34:45
 I, I don't you know, I don't know what you're asking really. 

00:34:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I'm not sure(ph) 

00:34:50
 I'm working, I'm working, I'm working my tail off right now. (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Yeah. 

00:34:55
 You know it's, I'm working long hours of the office uhm, you know, I provide for the family, at least a father was adequately. (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
 You know and, so you need to ask me, I'm willing to work hard, I'm working hard right now. (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, so how much energy are you willing to put in in the future, percentage-wise. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
 How hard am I would be working? (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I know, I know it's a question. It's kind of a guess being answered a kind of question, but that's okay. 

00:35:20
 Well, I'm a hard worker. I, I work hard. 

00:35:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING How hard is it? How much energy? 

00:35:25
 I put 30% of my energy here, yeah, for family days. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Thirty percent. Okay, mother, how about you? 

00:35:30
 I don't know because at this point I'm thinking it's about time that other people put forward their energy towards it... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
 ...because I've been working real hard to try and keep this family together... (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:35:40
 ...as it's falling apart. 

00:35:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So how much put percentage of your energy would that be approximately? 

00:35:45
  I don't know. I guess I'd be with them on about 30. 

00:35:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Thirty percent. Dolores? 

00:35:50
DOLORES  Gosh, I feel like 50%. 

00:35:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, Teresa? 

00:35:55
TERESA And so now, if I say less than 50, I'm not as good. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING No, you can say whatever you want. 

00:36:00
TERESA Well, mom and dad are willing to give 30, I'll give 30. 

00:36:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Thirty percent, okay. Now, ah, let me ask you this. How would you describe the connection that's between you? I mean, if we were to, to put, you know like a, had a ball of the yarn and we put connections between each of you, for sometimes I do but I don't wanna do it right now. Ah, how strong are those connections? The, the connections between you two, between you two, between you two, between you two. 

00:36:35
TERESA  You mean like a jump rope with it because it's that loose? 

00:36:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You think it's that loose, huh? 

00:36:40
TERESA  Yeah. 

00:36:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So if you put more energy into the, into the connections and you make them tighter, is that gonna be helpful or hurtful to you as a family if you, if you put some of that 30% or 50% or whatever it is into the connections? 

00:37:00
TERESA  Do you mean like doing stuff together and talking together and stuff? 

00:37:05
  That stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING The thought of putting it that way, would that sounds pretty good? 

00:37:10
 That stuff that we've been, I'm sorry, that stuff that I've been trying to do but every time I try and do that, for example with Teresa, she goes to totally opposite other direction where I'm taking a... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
 ...step forward and she's walking away. 

00:37:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So the, the, as she said the connection becomes like almost a jump rope very loopy. 

00:37:30
 Yeah. 

00:37:30
TERESA I'd be willing to do what I used to raise to go out and go often with Dad. 

00:37:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:37:30
TERESA  I'd be willing to go out and do it again. 

00:37:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:37:35
TERESA Saturday morning, I can go and do that again. 

00:37:35
 Would that you used to do? (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Would that make a connection tighter? 

00:37:40
TERESA Maybe if we'll be doing stuff together. We never do anything alone anymore. 

00:37:40
 We used to do a lot of stuff together. And just like everybody's going out on their way now... (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:37:45
  you know, I, it's, I don't know. 

00:37:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So do you. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
SABRINA There'd be, there'd be one more time when he wasn't at home. 

00:37:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh-huh. 

00:37:55
SABRINA I mean he goes to work when it's dark in the morning, he comes home when it's dark at night, and now he's gonna go, go often on the weekend, too. 

00:38:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So you're not thrilled with. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
SABRINA There's a house we have to take care of and kids that we have to take care of. (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
 So I'm, so I'm the reason that we're in here. 

00:38:05
SABRINA  I'm not saying you're the reason. I'm just saying that that's one of those things. It's a stress on me to have to take care of everything myself. 

00:38:15
 Well it's like what I'm doing is not important. 

00:38:15
SABRINA  You really need to work from that early in the morning until that late at night? (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
 Well, I have. 

00:38:25
SABRINA So what's your saying is that your job is more important than your family. (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
 I didn't say my job's more important than my family. What I'm saying is what I'm doing is important. It's part of my job. It never seemed to be a problem. 

00:38:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
 You know. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING let me, could you just put this on hold a minute? I wanna ask them something. Okay, what, how, is, what, is the way they were talking to each other pretty much an accurate picture of their ah, connection? You know, the, (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
DOLORES  Oh, yeah. 

00:38:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING the connection between them? 

00:38:50
DOLORES Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING How would you describe it? Nice and tight or would you say it's like there's a loop in it? 

00:38:55
DOLORES Loop. 

00:38:55
TERESA No, it's nice and tight, tight with anger. 

00:39:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, I know. I meant, I meant that tight means it's good. 

00:39:00
TERESA No, it's not that. 

00:39:00
DOLORES Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So it's kinda like a jump rope almost. 

00:39:05
TERESA Like a jump rope, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
DOLORES Uh hmm. 

00:39:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. That's how they see your relationship. 

00:39:05
SABRINA  Let's say they're probably right. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:39:15
SABRINA Because of this point, I think we're connected to our kids... (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:39:15
SABRINA ...but we don't spend that much time together. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, hmm. So let me ask you this. Does, does mom and dad, does your relationship as it is now, does it bring this family closer together as a unit or does it kind of prevent it? I'm not saying it's hurting it. I'm saying does it prevent it from becoming, you know, what you wanted to be. 

00:39:35
SABRINA  It's not what I'd like it to be but. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay, is it what you. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
 Our relationship or the family relationship? (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, no, no, your relationship. 

00:39:45
  I don't know. It is what it is. I mean it's. 

00:39:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Is it what you want it to be? 

00:39:50
  In stuff(ph), we're gonna used to be. 

00:39:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay, let me try that again. Is it what you wanted to be? 

00:40:00
  We're not always happy. I mean, I don't know. We bicker... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
SABRINA Hmm. 

00:40:10
 ...you know, what they described if that's the way it always is. 

00:40:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I'd like to translate that, Dad, into a question around what you want. You're not always happy, so would you want the relationship to be different so that you can be happier? 

00:40:25
 Yeah, I mean when you put it that way, I would, I wanna be happier. 

00:40:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING And you want it? Do you want the relationship to be different so you can be happier? 

00:40:35
SABRINA Yeah. 

00:40:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Now, let me ask you this. It is a very important question. If the relationship were better, you know, whether it wasn't this kind of jump rope between you, but it was a little more, you know, friendly, or whatever you wanna call it. How would they know that, that the relationship is improving? 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:00
SABRINA  I don't know. Why don't you ask them? 

00:41:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING No, I'd like you to guess at it. 

00:41:05
MAYBE  Maybe we wouldn't bicker and maybe we do something for ourselves. I mean, like together for ourselves. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, uh hmm. When was the last time you, you did something like that? 

00:41:20
 The last time he took off work. 

00:41:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  When was that? 

00:41:25
SABRINA I guess this summer. 

00:41:25
 It was in the spring. 

00:41:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING He took off work and you did what? 

00:41:30
 She went in to go up to the island, and I also told her I'd take a day off. 

00:41:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING And you did just the two of you? 

00:41:35
 Yeah. 

00:41:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Was that a happy experience or was that painful? 

00:41:40
  She enjoyed the shopping but I don't agree with a lot on top of that. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
SABRINA Yeah, I enjoyed that. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You enjoyed it, mother, right? 

00:41:45
  Yeah. 

00:41:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, dad, did you enjoy it? 

00:41:50
 It's all right. I mean, I am not much of a shopper. 

00:41:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  It wasn't painful. Is that what you're telling me? I'm not clear with what you mean. 

00:41:55
 No, no, it wasn't painful. 

00:42:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING But was it, was it something that... (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
 It was okay. (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...you would like to do it again or not? 

00:42:00
 Uhm, I'd spend time with her; yeah, I wouldn't go crazy about the hour. 

00:42:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay so, so it was an okay experience but it wasn't your first choice. 

00:42:10
SABRINA Yeah. 

00:42:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I mean I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. I'm just, I'm. (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
 Yeah, yeah. I'd say it was okay. I went crazy about the shopping. 

00:42:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:42:15
 We had a nice lunch and. (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So you haven't gone and said, "Sabrina, I'd really like to go up to the mall again. I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
 No. 

00:42:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I mean the out(ph), you haven't said that. 

00:42:25
SABRINA (inaudible ) sick (crosstalk) 

00:42:27
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I didn't hear it well. (crosstalk) 

00:42:27
SABRINA I don't take him serious if I heard him say that. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
 No, I don't think so. 

00:42:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You're gonna kick out on that. 

00:42:30
 I just kinda might. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
TERESA  It's hard to go shopping, with Dad. (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
DOLORES Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:42:35
 I've always told her if I'm unlucky enough to go to hell I think it's gonna be out at malling(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, now I understand. You already figure that out then... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
TERESA  Oh, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...you're a little bit ahead of me. Yeah, that's good, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
DOLORES Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
TERESA Okay, he shopping, yeah. 

00:42:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, okay. So what would you like to see them doing that would kind of give some proof that their relationship is getting better? 

00:42:55
[sil.] 

00:42:55
DOLORES  I guess argue less. 

00:43:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Argue less. 

00:43:05
TERESA I was just gonna say talk nicely to each other. 

00:43:05
DOLORES Uh hmm. 

00:43:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:43:05
  They make it sound like we argue a lot of time. We do not argue that much. 

00:43:10
TERESA It's not that they argue. It's just the way they talk. You, you know, that nasty. 

00:43:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING How do they talk? 

00:43:15
TERESA Nasty like when a teacher is telling you. 

00:43:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Show me, show me. 

00:43:20
TERESA Oh like, when are you working again? I mean, you know, of that kind. I just said nasty. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Tell, tell me, tell me very well. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
TERESA That nasty. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Tell me. Do that again. 

00:43:30
TERESA "You're working again? Gosh, can't... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:43:30
TERESA ...you stay home for a little bit", you know. 

00:43:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay. 

00:43:35
TERESA That kinda. (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING What do you, what do you see in here? 

00:43:35
DOLORES Well, I have to agree with that and, and some sarcasm like. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Can, can you do it? Can you do it? 

00:43:40
TERESA Yes, that's a good word, sarcasm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
DOLORES Yeah, yeah. 

00:43:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I'm not one of them and, and do it. 

00:43:45
DOLORES "Oh, I see you're home." 

00:43:45
TERESA  And then they, they had this fact, do you know. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. Now, now. (rosstalk) 

00:43:55
TERESA (inaudible ) It's true and you know. (crosstalk) 

00:43:56
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. So you know we, we got a good picture here. We got a good picture of what's... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
TERESA (inaudible ). 

00:44:03
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...how people see things so, and, and you agree with that. I, I gathered from what you said... (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
SABRINA Not to that extent... (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING agree not to that ah, (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
SABRINA ...that's a little theatrical. 

00:44:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, it's a little bit over done in your mind. 

00:44:10
SABRINA Yeah. 

00:44:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING All right, all right. But, now let me ask you this. What do they need to see you doing differently that would give them the idea, "Now mom and dad are really getting closer together." 

00:44:25
SABRINA Well, they just said being nicer. 

00:44:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. So one ah, suppose, suppose you would just talk that way to each other, what would that be like? 

00:44:35
 It's not that we're not nice to each other. 

00:44:35
SABRINA Yeah. 

00:44:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I know, I know but I'm talking about being nicer. It's not good or bad. It's better. 

00:44:40
SABRINA  I don't know how I can talk with a little sugar and sweet tone of voice, (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:44:50
SABRINA it's not my normal voice. 

00:44:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. OKay 

00:44:50
 Yeah. 

00:44:50
SABRINA We only just talk like we talk? 

00:44:55
 I thought we did. 

00:44:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, how are they talking right now? 

00:44:55
 You are sarcastic at times though. You know it's like. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
SABRINA I'm the type of personality, though.(crosstalk) 

00:45:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Wait, wait just, just a second. How are they talking now? How do that sound to you? 

00:45:00
TERESA  Up to these last few minutes it's better than usual. 

00:45:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING It was better. It was better. (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
DOLORES Right, right. 

00:45:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING What was different about it? 

00:45:05
TERESA  He didn't have, he didn't have that sarcastic... (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
DOLORES Right. (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
TERESA ...that bite to it. 

00:45:10
DOLORES Yeah, the tone, tone is there(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. Okay so, so are, are you saying you would like to see that in your parents a little bit more often. 

00:45:20
TERESA Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
DOLORES Hmm. 

00:45:20
TERESA it'd be nice to know if they stay that way. 

00:45:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Now, I got another question. Did you, uh, before I do that, did you hear what they said? 

00:45:25
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
 That we should talk nicer to each other. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  I'm not saying, I'm not saying you have to agree with them. I'm just talking about how people look at things. 

00:45:30
 That we should talk nicer to each other. 

00:45:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING What do you think? Possible or not possible? 

00:45:40
 I think it's possible. I think it's hard to keep track of it like that because we never have. 

00:45:45
 Hmm. 

00:45:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, let me ask you this. Are you interested and is this really important for you to do something that, that this family becomes closer together more cohesive? 

00:45:55
 So our talking nice to each other is gonna do that? 

00:46:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING What do you, is it gonna hurt? 

00:46:00
SABRINA How's that gonna fix our problems? 

00:46:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, we're getting to that. 

00:46:05
TERESA Didn't I just say if you talk nicer to each other I'd wanna be home more? 

00:46:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. Can we just come back to that? 

00:46:10
TERESA Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. Ah, What do you think? 

00:46:15
 We talk nicer to each other. 

00:46:20
SABRINA Okay. We can try it. 

00:46:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Well let's say like tonight. What would you, how would you talk that would sort of create an atmosphere in the house a, a little more cohesiveness among other things? 

00:46:35
SABRINA I guess that would be just me taken my sarcastic comments out. 

00:46:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING And, and saying what? 

00:46:40
SABRINA  Well, if I've been taken them out I wouldn't save it all. 

00:46:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, what would say instead? 

00:46:45
  You're having a tough... (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
SABRINA (laughs) That's the sad part. (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
 ...with this, aren't you? (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
 If you take away this argue and what's left? (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Now, okay, everybody, everybody has its tough time with this. This is very hard work. This is hard, hard work. 

00:47:00
SABRINA I don't know what I would say it's although I, my sarcastic comments are usually about something that I think is stupid so... (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
SABRINA ...I make a sarcastic comment about it so I just wanna say anything at all. Isn't that what the, the deal is... (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
 Hmm. 

00:47:10
SABRINA ...that if you have anything nice to say don't say anything at all? 

00:47:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING But it's good probably(ph) when nobody talks. (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
 Oh for crying out loud(ph), see I'm telling you. 

00:47:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING It'll be a long evening if nobody talks. 

00:47:20
 I think what she's telling you is if she doesn't have something to pick at me about... (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:47:25
 ...then she doesn't mean to say. 

00:47:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING But would you be willing to think about ways to say things and this is what we can do in future sessions as I talk about how all of you can talk to each other better. 

00:47:35
SABRINA  Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:47:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:47:40
SABRINA I'm fine with that. 

00:47:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, if you talk to each other civilly, we're gonna get to you two in a minute. If you talk to each other civilly, is that gonna bring this family together as a happy family or is it gonna spread you all over the place, the way you talk to each other? Which one? Is it gonna take you up or take you down? 

00:47:55
SABRINA  I guess I see that's the tiny step, but I don't see... (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Tiny or... (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
SABRINA ...it solving the problem. (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...it's, it's very tiny. 

00:48:05
SABRINA Yeah. 

00:48:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, and we get, you know, there's like 50 steps here and this is the first one. 

00:48:10
 How we talk to each other? 

00:48:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:15
SABRINA  I just don't get while we're working on this and we've got to use massive problems going on. 

00:48:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, yeah. Well, that massive problems are gonna be there, but we're gonna take one step at a time. 

00:48:30
TERESA Yeah, bottom line. 

00:48:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Ah, I asked you if you wanna stay together. And we're just talking about how you talk to each other. We're gonna get to the massive problems in just a minute. Now, what are you two willing to do? Their, their willing to do some things. 

00:48:45
TERESA I said, If there are nice, sweet start trying to be... (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
TERESA ...nice to each other, I'll try to be humble. 

00:48:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING what will you do? 

00:48:50
TERESA Well, I'll try to be humbler. I'll try not to take it out with my friends. (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Would that, is that the massive problem they're talking about? 

00:48:55
TERESA Just a part of it. They don't, they don't like the...(crosstalk) 

00:49:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING What's the, what do you think the massive problem is that we're talking? (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
TERESA ...they don't like the people I hang out, with the things I do with the, and the grades that I get. (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
TERESA Now, I'm the bad kind. Dolores is the perfect angel when I'm the bad kind. 

00:49:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay, is that what you meant by the massive problems? 

00:49:10
SABRINA It should be in really general about the massive problems. 

00:49:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. Okay so. (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
TERESA I said like the stuff I did, right, and the friends I hang out with. That's what you don't like. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
DOLORES Well say it to me, is that (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
SABRINA The stuff will be (inaudible [00:49:21.019]) all that. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Let me ask. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
DOLORES Say it, damn it. 

00:49:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Ah, our risk... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
TERESA You never cuss... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...our risk (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
TERESA ...is that, is that ah, (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
SABRINA We don't need that. 

00:49:25
TERESA  Is that 10%? 

00:49:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I'm impressed. Now, ah, let me ask you this. Uhm, have you ever talked about these massive problems? 

00:49:40
TERESA Not, they yell, they yell about it. 

00:49:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay and you, and you've heard? (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
 And when she slams her door (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
TERESA I slam my door, all right, and start playing my guitar. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING And you've, you've talked about the massive problems? 

00:49:45
 We've tried. 

00:49:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Right? 

00:49:50
SABRINA She's usually out the door... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I know, I know... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
SABRINA ...before we can talk about it. (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...but you've tried to talk about it, right? 

00:49:50
TERESA  They've never tried to talk. They just yell. 

00:49:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, let me ask you this. If we were to spend the next five weeks talking about the massive problems in a way similar to the way you've already talked about them, where would we be? 

00:50:05
SABRINA  We're not allowed to do that... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
 Yeah, as the way I see it... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
SABRINA ...and we tend to talk nicer, are we? (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
 ...and we talk nice to each other. 

00:50:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, you can talk of the, you can do whatever you want. I'm just asking you where would you be if we continue to talk about the massive problems the way you have talked about them up to now. 

00:50:25
SABRINA Well, if she would listen... (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
 I was just gonna say if, (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
SABRINA ...maybe we'd be some place else. 

00:50:25
 if she would listen, you know, she makes this sound like we're the bad guys. 

00:50:30
SABRINA Uh-huh. 

00:50:30
 You know, she's running around doing all this stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh-huh. 

00:50:35
 And it's like, you know, if, if, if we talk to each other nicer, it's gonna change something, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
SABRINA She says we yell at her, but if not, they were yelling. It's just that she doesn't like what we're saying. 

00:50:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. My question to you is this. Are you willing to take the massive problems and put them in a little room in your house sometimes we call as the red room. You just put them in that room. You can come back to them and blubber each other later. But for a short amount of time, everyday or once a week, whatever it is, would you be willing to take the massive problems that you really came here for? I know you came for that. But I'm saying, I'm trying to get under those massive problems. Would you be willing to take the massive problems and set them aside for just a short amount of time, say for 10 minutes a night 15 minutes a night. 

00:51:25
TERESA  Tell me what we do in that 10 to 15 minutes. (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  I don't know but the, the only question on the table now is are you willing to do that? 

00:51:40
SABRINA That depends. 

00:51:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING And if you're not willing to do it then I can't help you. I can help you if you're willing to take some steps. You came here for this kind of help. If you want to continue to complain with each other and attack each other, you can certainly do that. 

00:51:55
DOLORES So this would be another, (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You don't need me. 

00:51:55
DOLORES another little step. 

00:51:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING It's a tiny little step. 

00:51:55
DOLORES Okay. 

00:51:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  It's like the second step. If you're willing to do that, you're up to the second step. 

00:52:00
TERESA  So they would pretend like, (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING No, no, (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
TERESA like there is, well I'm saying while they're in the red room. 

00:52:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  you would pretend. 

00:52:10
TERESA I would pretend. (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You would... (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
TERESA Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...put problem in the red room. 

00:52:10
TERESA  I don't think I've got, I mean, I don't think what they think is a problem is a problem but okay, (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Whatever it is, whatever. (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
TERESA but I would put my stuff until I'm angry about that... (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:52:20
TERESA ...and I would just be me for 10 or 15 minutes. (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Correct. You'd, you'd be a little different than you've been. 

00:52:25
TERESA When I would say that with them, I mean, I wouldn't be up in my room and play my guitar and I have to... (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yes, that's right. 

00:52:30
TERESA ...I just spend time with them. 

00:52:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING And, and if you did that, would it strengthen the connection with them or would it weaken? 

00:52:35
TERESA And if they're willing to do it, too. I mean we're all willing to do. (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah I know that they're willing, I'm asking you. (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
TERESA I mean if I'm, if I'm, well I'm saying if I'm willing to do but they're still treating me like trash then that's not gonna make me feel any better... (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
SABRINA Trash. 

00:52:45
TERESA ...but if they're willing to do that same thing you kinda be (inaudible [00:52:49.819])(crosstalk). 

00:52:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I'm asking each of you, I'm asking of you if you're willing to put the problem aside for a few minutes. (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
TERESA  I'm willing if, if, I'm willing to try it. 

00:52:55
SABRINA What happens... (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
DOLORES I'm willing. (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
SABRINA ...if that's the only 15 minutes at the night... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
 We treat you, we treat you like trash. (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
SABRINA ...that we see her? If that's the only 15 minutes out of the night that I see her, you're telling me I'm also to ignore the fact that she's out droppin' acid? 

00:53:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Have you ignored her often? (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
TERESA  Twice. (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
 And then we... (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
TERESA Twice mom, twice. 

00:53:10
 ...we treat you like trash. We treat you like trash. 

00:53:10
SABRINA  That kind of shirks my responsibility as a mother if I'm not worried about my daughter doing illegal things. 

00:53:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Uh-huh. Well, you can go home and do that then. You can talk, you can spend more time attacking, (sighs) arguing, if you wanna do that. I'm only asking you is it bringing this family closer together, strengthening that, those ties, or is it, or the ties becoming sloppy and loose and like jump rope. It's up to you. I can't force you. I don't, I don't have any, any magic wand here to waive over you but these ideas are helpful if you're willing to do them. You didn't come for me to tell you to keep doing what you're doing, if you did. I can't help you with them. 

00:54:00
SABRINA  I guess I just don't understand how ignoring the problem is gonna help it. 

00:54:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Well, if you'd become civil toward each other or everybody, do you really think that's ignoring the problem? 

00:54:15
SABRINA  I don't think it's helping any. 

00:54:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I mean let's talk all about it more and more. Let's keep talking about it for the next five years. 

00:54:25
DOLORES It hasn't helped so far. 

00:54:25
  Nobody's listened. No. (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
DOLORES No.(crosstalk) 

00:54:30
 Hmm. We get nothing. (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Do you want them to listen to you? Is it... (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
 Yes. 

00:54:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...really important for you to your kids to listen? Have they listened up to now especially the one that you think is the problem, Teresa? 

00:54:40
SABRINA No, she slams the door. (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
 (inaudible ). 

00:54:44
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Okay. So talking the way and slamming the door hasn't helped either, right? 

00:54:45
TERESA  Right. I know that. (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:54:50
TERESA I'm sure it makes it stop the, I mean it's a temper. (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING And arguing. (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
TERESA It's always the temper that's bad.(crosstalk) 

00:54:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  And Dolores arguing with her hasn't helped, right? 

00:54:55
DOLORES No. 

00:54:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
 Then she should go out. 

00:54:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So if, what now, (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
SABRINA Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING this is, this is probably the most important question ever asked you. If the way you'd been doing in dealing with this is not getting you what you really want which is a cohesive family, which I thought you said you want it, if that hasn't worked, are you willing to try something different as a family now, not individually but as a unit. Even though you think it's not such a great idea. You may not think it's a great idea because I'm not saying what you wanna hear. Are you willing to do some things that are different in what you've done? That's the central question here. If you are, I believe this family will be a happy family. It'll be a family where those not little yarn, you know, that I mentioned that's really strong and firm, and you'll really like each other but that's gonna take some work. 

00:55:50
SABRINA  If you think that's gonna help, I'll give it a shot. 

00:55:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  No, I not only think it's gonna help, there is no doubt in my mind, if you're willing to do it. 

00:56:05
TERESA I already said I was. 

00:56:10
DOLORES I am. 

00:56:10
SABRINA I'll just go into it skeptical. 

00:56:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  You can be skeptical. Well, I don't blame you. I mean I'd be planning skeptical if I were in your shoes. 

00:56:20
SABRINA Are you. (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Dad, I didn't hear any answer. 

00:56:25
 (sighs) Yeah. 

00:56:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, I didn't hear that excited answer but it's kind of a, that sounds like a yes. 

00:56:40
 I mean if we only try something different, that's fine. 

00:56:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Let me ask you this. Suppose you tried something different, maybe talking pleasant with each other, maybe doing something, I don't know if you're ready for that but doing something together, going out, you know, whatever it maybe but, but if you did that for, say 21 straight days, if you did this for 21 straight days... (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
 My God. 

00:57:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING (laughs) and there isn't any change in the family, in other words if you are just as upset with each other then I would say stop it immediately and go back to what you were doing. 

00:57:20
 So we didn't kill each other (inaudible [00:57:22.958]). 

00:57:20
 21 days is a long time. (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Twenty-one days, 21 days is a long time but 21 days... (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
TERESA I think it's great. (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...is a lot less than a lifetime of misery. (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
DOLORES Yeah. 

00:57:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Which is better for you? 

00:57:35
 So she just is gonna go ahead and keep doing drugs for 21 days and we're just supposed to. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
TERESA Twice, mom, twice. 

00:57:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I don't know, no, no, she's, let me, let's face it, have you tried to stop her? 

00:57:45
SABRINA  Yeah. 

00:57:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING How's it worked? 

00:57:50
 It hasn't but... (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:57:50
 ...that doesn't mean that... (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
TERESA  I thought it twice.(crosstalk) 

00:57:55
 ...shouldn't have a sense of urgency about it. 

00:57:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, if she needs a drug program, well, we can figure that out. 

00:58:00
TERESA I don't, I don't have a problem. I've done it twice. 

00:58:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, yeah. I never met anybody who took drugs and thought they had a problem. I mean that's very rare. That, that would be very rare. So we haven't even gotten to this yet. (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
DOLORES (inaudible ). 

00:58:14
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I mean we haven't even gotten to drug problem. 

00:58:15
MOM Uh hmm, that's my point. 

00:58:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING That's, I know. 

00:58:15
DAD I think it's clear we're going to try something different because this, what you're seeing here, I mean we're being nice because you're here. 

00:58:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Oh, yeah. I'm sure you got a lot of this on hold. 

00:58:25
DAD And what you're seeing here is the way it is. (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, it's intensify a lot of times. (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
DAD (inaudible ) so I'm not home. 

00:58:31
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Sure. Did you ever throw anything, you to her room and slam the door (inaudible ) anything? (crosstalk) 

00:58:39
DAD And throws things out of the door. 

00:58:39
DOLORES  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
TERESA I don't really think I get just carried(ph) to my guitar. (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Got mad and took anything, really get upset? 

00:58:45
DAD Sure. 

00:58:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Sure. So you're coming here because you're, I thought you were coming here because you're looking for something better than that. 

00:58:50
DAD  It'd be nice if it wasn't like this. 

00:58:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:58:55
MOM  Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, I think it's very possible. I'm very hopeful, if you want the family to stay together and if you really want to try something different. If you wanna do that, there's a lot of hope. Worse families than this have worked things out very happily, let me tell you. 

00:59:15
DAD  And maybe we need to try something different. 

00:59:20
MOM  I'm with him because I don't think there's anything that's left for us to try. 

00:59:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. Now, are you willing to, can you be a friend of hers for 21 days? I don't mean you have to be buddy-buddy but just kind of like, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
TERESA We're nice to each other at school (crosstalk). 

00:59:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...friend.

TERESA We kinda do that at home. 

00:59:40
DOLORES I think so. (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Are you willing to stay away from drugs and anything illegal or even alcohol for 21 days? 

00:59:45
TERESA  You mean I don't use it on my friends. 

00:59:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, I can't. I don't know anything about your friends. 

00:59:50
TERESA But I mean I can still hang out with my friends as long as I don't do stuff with them, right? 

00:59:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I can't give you permission to hang out with your friends or to forbid you from hanging out with them. I'm, I'm asking you are you willing no matter what... (crosstalk)

01:00:05
TERESA I can for three weeks, that's not a problem. 

01:00:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Now, let me ask you this. If you hang out with the same friends, does this gonna bring you closer to your mother and dad, and your sister? Is it gonna bring you farther away? 

01:00:15
TERESA They don't like my friends. I'm sure it's gonna. 

01:00:15

TERESA I'm just, you know, for three weeks that's a long time. I mean they're my friends at school. 

01:00:30
MOM I guess you started to be in sarcastic and you're not gonna do anything? 

01:00:30

TERESA We never fought back then. 

01:02:20
DOLORES No, we didn't. 

01:02:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING If you could give her to talk like that more, believe me, the drugs would mean nothing to her, but it would take some time. Okay, I just thought I drew that out. Now, so ah, what time will you be willing to ah, do all, do something in the evening?

Now, if you were able to extend that 20-second kidding and laughing, and kinda cozying up to each other, if you could extend that to a minute and then two minutes, and maybe even the whole meal once a week, man, I'd, I'd say this family is way beyond where I thought you'd be. 

01:04:50
[sil.] 

01:04:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Could you handle that kinda stuff tomorrow night? 

01:05:00
MOM Does that mean I'm allowed to be sarcastic? 

01:05:00
DAD I could(ph). 

01:05:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well let's put it this way. How many times would you wanna be sarcastic during the course of a meal? (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
MOM  Oh, I... (crosstalk) 

01:05:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Could you handle about... (crosstalk) 

01:05:10
MOM ...don't know. That means like I could, I could handle not doing mean and sarcastic. 

01:05:10
DAD  Yes, I could... (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Just, how about just... (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
DAD ...hold some sarcasm but... (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING How about good... (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
DAD that(ph) we need so much more. 

01:05:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  How about friendly sarcasm. Say, let's say three times. 

01:05:25
MOM Okay. 

01:05:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Could you live with that if she's friendly sarcastic? 

01:05:25
DOLORES  Okay, we know how mom is. We know how... (crosstalk) 

01:05:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:05:30
DOLORES ...to take up. 

01:05:30
TERESA Yeah. 

01:05:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING But three times. 

01:05:30
MOM Okay. 

01:05:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Would you write it down in efforts, it's been like what you said? 

01:05:35
MOM You want me to keep paths marks or what? 

01:05:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, no not hash(ph) marks, the whole thing, write the whole thing. (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
MOM You want me to write the whole things then? 

01:05:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, why not? 

01:05:40
MOM That's kinda hard to remember but I'll try. 

01:05:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
DAD Yeah, we'll help you. 

01:05:45
TERESA We'll help mom. 

01:05:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, I think you'll get some help. (crosstalk) 

01:05:45
MOM Until there's a three times, okay. 

01:05:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Maybe you and Dolores could, could sit and write that down. 

01:05:50
MOM Okay. 

01:05:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, while they're writing that down, dad, would you two kind of do something together? I mean just for a couple of minutes. 

01:06:00
TERESA You come up next to me and play the guitar; you haven't done that in months. 

01:06:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Ken(ph), could you do it without any kind of, (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
DAD Yeah, (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING you know. (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
DAD I mean when she first started I showed her a few chords, and we picked around... (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Then you play. 

01:06:15
DAD ...a little bit. Yeah, (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
DAD yeah, not the steps she plays it. 

01:06:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING did you know that? 

01:06:15
TERESA Yeah, I mean that's, you know, when I first... (crosstalk) 

01:06:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:06:21
TERESA ...get the guitar, it's really cool. 

01:06:21
 Yeah. 

01:06:21
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING So would you be willing to do that? Would you be willing to spend a little with this, this is called quality time. It's a little bit of jargon... (crosstalk) 

01:06:25
DAD  I think, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...but that's what it is. 

01:06:30
DAD I can get my guitar out. (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You're having a good time together. 

01:06:30
DAD Yeah, I could get my guitar out. We can play a little bit together. I mean she kinda get(ph) a Queen album that you thought it's pretty cool. (crosstalk) 

01:06:35
TERESA I think it's cool. Oh yeah. 

01:06:40
DAD We can play it together. 

01:06:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Why don't you tell him that? 

01:06:45
TERESA Yeah, I think it would be really neat(ph) to play together. You give me some hands on when I'm doing wrong in writing. 

01:06:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Call him dad, call him dad. 

01:06:50
TERESA Oh, dad. Okay, dad, that'll be neat. (crosstalk) 

01:06:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING When was the... (crosstalk) 

01:06:55
TERESA I like that. 

01:06:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...last time she called you dad? 

01:06:55
DAD  In that total months, I can't remember. 

01:07:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING All the time. So, (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
TERESA (inaudible ). 

01:07:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  You're making more progress already than I really expected in the beginning. I thought maybe there wasn't hope but I've(ph) kinda changed my mind. The important thing is though that you change your mind and really come to the belief that, that this family is a good family, and that you can stay together and be happy. And you can, you can get along and she can have friends that are okay that don't need drugs. You know, Dolores can do what you wanna do in school and not have to throw things. Let me ask this. This is really, really a far out question and, and I never asked this question the first time I, I talked to a family. I almost never asked this but I, I mean that's a little risky. You think I could do and take a little risk here, and be all right? 

01:08:00
MOM You're the counselor. 

01:08:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  I know but would it be all right if, if I did it? Okay, I wanna ask you this. Do you, and this really kind of in tense. I know this maybe, I'm overdoing but I'm gonna ask you before you're coming here. Do you love each other? Would you say you love each other? I mean even a little bit. (crosstalk) 

01:08:25
MOM Oh, we're a family. 

01:08:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Dolores, what do you think? 

01:08:25
DOLORES  I don't know. I. 

01:08:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  It's an honest answer, okay? But you, but you don't hate anybody. 

01:08:40
DOLORES No. 

01:08:40
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay. Teresa, how about you? 

01:08:40
TERESA  If I think about how things used to be I, I feel a lot of love for these people. (crosstalk) 

01:08:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Do you really, really? 

01:08:45
TERESA  No, I mean that's kinda hard to say that right now. 

01:08:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, it's hard, sure, sure. 

01:08:50
TERESA But, yeah, down deep inside this, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:08:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Did you hear what she said the way it used to be? Dolores is not sure but she's kinda like, like, are you kinda like on, on the edge, on the middle? 

01:09:00
DOLORES Yeah, I guess I don't know... (crosstalk) 

01:09:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

01:09:05
DOLORES ...that that would really mean this. It means that we're, we're connecting. (crosstalk) 

01:09:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Yeah. 

01:09:10
DOLORES Is that a sign of love? 

01:09:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING What about you, dad? 

01:09:10
DAD  If I didn't love them I wouldn't be here. 

01:09:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm. Does that mean you do love them? 

01:09:15
DAD Yes. 

01:09:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Could you say that to them? 

01:09:20
DAD Uh hmm. Here? 

01:09:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, right now? 

01:09:25
MOM You're afraid to say it? 

01:09:25
DAD  They know that I love them. 

01:09:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I know. 

01:09:30
DAD  You know and I'd, I'm here to talk about the way things used to be. Uhm. Yeah, I love them. 

01:09:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Did you hear what he said? 

01:09:50
MOM  Yeah, I hear what he said. 

01:09:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING How about you, mother? 

01:09:55
MOM Well, yeah, I wanna know my family. I wouldn't have made a call if I didn't love them. I wouldn't want the best for everybody if I didn't love them. 

01:10:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING These people are important to you, right? 

01:10:05
MOM Yeah. 

01:10:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Dad, they're important to you? 

01:10:10
DAD Absolutely. 

01:10:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  This family's important to you? 

01:10:15
DOLORES Yeah. 

01:10:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  When I think you gotta couple of things to do between now and the next time we talk. (crosstalk) 

01:10:25
TERESA That three-week thing, right? 

01:10:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Pardon me? 

01:10:30
TERESA That three-week thing, right? 

01:10:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING That three-week thing. Today, what we'd, I'd like to check back with you in the next week and see how's it going, and it's not that I'm checking so much, it's just that you are really checking with each other and you can kinda get some things out and you open and, you know, we'll continue from where we are and see how you do. But I'd like to ask you if you would do one more thing and this isn't doing something. It's just kinda keeping track of something. Would you just kind of think about, reflect on how you feel, you know, and I don't mean you have to get into a long psychological thing about it or do you feel better and how much better do you feel when you do these things together. 

01:11:05
TERESA  Do you want us to write it down? 

01:11:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, that's a good idea. 

01:11:15
TERESA Can I come home (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:11:17
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING (inaudible ). What? (crosstalk) 

01:11:18
TERESA Can I, I should do my homework assignment. (crosstalk) 

01:11:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You put in your homework assignment and you just kinda, you know, I can give you a sheet of paper with a kind of a little scale on it but I don't know whether you mean that or not. But just, then(ph) maybe you could just feel better, how much better 5%, 10%- 

01:11:30
DAD Do we talk to each other about this or just something on them? (crosstalk) 

01:11:35
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You don't have to know, just kinda, kinda keep a record of it. And we'll talk about it when you come back. If you forget, it's okay, but we'll talk about it, you know, we can bring it up next week. 

01:11:40
TERESA  Dolores will remind us. 

01:11:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Pardon me? 

01:11:45
TERESA Dolores will remind us. She never forgets anything. 

01:11:45
DOLORES  Thank you. 

01:11:50
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING How're you doing, Dolores? Are you okay with all this? 

01:11:50
DOLORES Yeah, yeah. This was not different than I thought it would be. 

01:11:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Oh, yeah. A little different than I thought it would be, too. I don't really have a lot to expect. 

01:12:00
DOLORES I just thought we were gonna come here and spill our guts, and we're gonna talk about feelings and problems and, (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Hmm, well, I think you'd do that to some extent. 

01:12:10
DOLORES I guess. 

01:12:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Uhm, but see I like, I'm bigger on solutions. Let's try to figure out, out of deep, do something about it. You notice that, that I'd like to ask people to talk more about of how they're gonna solve things rather than talking about all the aches and pains and the criticisms and attacking. All right, can I, can I make another suggestion? Did you all come together in the same car? 

01:12:40
MOM  Yeah. 

01:12:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, when you go home in the car, do not talk about anything that happened here tonight, in track and better if you can hold off. Don't talk about it for 24 hours. 

01:12:55
TERESA So tomorrow at dinner we could talk about it. (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING You can talk about it tomorrow. I mean you could talk about it anytime. This is just a suggestion. But especially if you can hold off in the car. 

01:13:05
MOM Why are we doing that? 

01:13:05
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  Well because then you have to talk about something else. 

01:13:10
MOM  Okay, what else... (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING All right. 

01:13:15
MOM ...do we talk about? 

01:13:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  I don't know, it's up to you. Now, are you willing to shake hands in all of this. 

01:13:20
MOM  Sure. 

01:13:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, that means you're really gonna do it. You're not just watching him. (crosstalk) 

01:13:30
DOLORES Okay. 

01:13:30
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, you wanna shake hands together here and you shake hands with him. (crosstalk) 

01:13:35
DAD (inaudible ) 

01:13:37
MOM (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:13:38
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay, now, how about let's see a little hand shaking here. There you go. And a little hand shaking there. Look at that. Everybody's shaking hands. Did anybody get skipped? I... (crosstalk) 

01:13:45
DOLORES You got skipped. 

01:13:45
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING ...got skipped, I got skipped. I wanna shake hands with you all. Okay, I'll see you next time, same time, same place. 

01:13:50
DAD  We'll be here. 

01:13:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING All right, (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
MOM Okay. 

01:13:55
DOLORES Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING good. Did it do a good job? Yeah, okay. (crosstalk) 

01:14:00
TERESA (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:14:01
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Now, one thing in roleplay is it's important to leave the role right here on the floor, on the floor so I'd like you to say I am not dad. 

01:14:10
DAD I am not dad. 

01:14:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I am not mom. 

01:14:10
MOM I am not mom. 

01:14:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I am not Dolores. 

01:14:10
DOLORES  I. (crosstalk) 

01:14:15
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING That, we know, we know what you mean. 

01:14:15
DOLORES I am not Dolores. 

01:14:15
TERESA  I'm not (inaudible ) Teresa. 

01:14:22
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Okay so, ah, you just kinda leave the roles here and then you don't have to take them with you and, all right let's- 

01:14:25
[sil.] 

01:14:25
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING  All right, let's talk about that. We have about ah, 10 minutes? Okay, and ah, maybe I should just talk a little about what I tried to do as I reflect on this and then we can discuss it if you care to. Uhm, what I tried to do is to let them go on the way they do that would be the current behavior, the doing, just let them talk a little bit, and kind of doing an assessment and see how, you know, how are they talking to each other, how are they getting along, and they were mildly talking in a negative way. It wasn't extremely negative but it was fairly. I'd like, we said later they had it in a suit and we're talking in a little subdued way which people often do when they're in counseling. And ah, and then I tried to ask them about their quality world, their wants and I'm in just, I just tried to make it simple, one or two wants, do you want to stay together. And then I forget I came back later to some other wants but do you want to keep this family as a unit, and then how important is it. So, you can have it in your quality world but is it a high priority, is it a really intensive want, and so they were committed to that. And then, ah, and I, and I just focused on one aspect of their behavior, how you are talking to each other. And we talked about that, talked about that, talked about that for a long time and it seemed a repetition for a while, you know, it's kinda seemed like we weren't going anywhere with that. And then, ah, I, we somehow, I don't remember exactly how it got on to, how, how much time are you spending together and what, what value is the time that you spend together. Can you, can you do this, this quality time without a, a hassling with each other and attacking each other, and all of that. And the, and the doing apart was also the red room. Can you at least put it aside for a while? Can you set the problems aside? I don't think they were ready for dissolving circles. They may be but I would, I wanna put that on hold and come back to that the next time we can talk about it. Ah, can you, can you talk to each other about how to solve the problem? I didn't think that they were quite ready for that, but that wasn't very off-the-cuff judgment and I could be a hundred percent wrong about that. But I see this as developmental, some of this process, and you have to build up to things. Ah, and then I interspersed the self-evaluation questions. If you do nothing different and you could hear that, I could hear them sighing, you probably saw them, Oh God, why are we here? And you know, Sabrina saying, Oh I came, I can just hear the wheels are turning and the, you know why we came here, one thing it is not doing it, this is not doing what we wanted to do, and I could hear that and it was really quite, quite opened it. And uhm, so, so, ah, but, but then ah, also I think it's important to deal with that particular issue in that particular ah, frustration that she has otherwise she's gonna go and never come back. So, so, and she used the phrase the big, (inaudible ) the massive problem, (crosstalk) 

01:17:26
MOM The massive problem. 

01:17:26
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING the massive problems. I tried to use that to connect with her. And then, of course, we finally got to the, to, that they were, they would do something different than what they're doing and even, and I cannot build, there's something about, you know, this question. I don't know if you're ready in some risk, and you know, by this time you say God ask it, ask it. You know, and so I said do you love each other and Ken was very (inaudible ) you know, like John Wayne so, ah, so. (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
DAD That's what I'd always thought. 

01:17:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Right? So, so, but they were willing to do that and they were willing to kind of reach out a little bit toward each other and, and ah, so, so the next time we're gonna build on this, ask how it went, time, can you extend the time to spend a little bit, can you extend a little bit in the solving circle, ah, lots of things that, that we could do with this group, with this family in the future. There's just plenty of directions you can go in. Keep in mind as you watch this or as you watch it live or you watch it on tape, ah, the point of the role play is to trigger some thoughts in your minds about ways you would do this that I didn't think of and I hope thousands of people will see this tape or my own family maybe. Ah, but ah, who, whoever sees it, I hope you will think of ways that you could do this better, ways that you would say that this is more, this is more appropriate for me and this is a direction I would have go in. He missed this. That's all very possible and quite accurate so I don't pretend to present this as the way to do things. I think it is A way to do this. And you can incorporate other ideas that you may have. We have time for just about one or two questions or thoughts. Yes, yes. 

01:19:10
 I have a question about the level of commitment. 

01:19:10
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Yeah, the level of commitment. 

01:19:10
  You have a family rolling one or two, maybe you have a high level of commitment that change and the others are not, where do you go from there? 

01:19:20
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING Well, yeah, the question is ah, if you, you, you know, ah, if one has a high level but the others don't, I, I would say if they're coming they have some commitment. And if, if one said, I have no commitment at all. I say, well you're already, you must have some, you're here. So they're gonna minimize their commitment. I'll maximize it. On the other hand, if they say, oh I'm gonna put on 180%, I'd say, how about 10%, how about 20%, to get them to really look at their behavior in a different way, but I'd find whatever they have and build on it. Ah, I think that's, that's an important aspect. Yes? 

01:19:55
 How long was this conversation? 

01:19:55
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I'm sorry. 

01:19:55
 What amount of time would you use to have a session like this? 

01:20:00
ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING I think it depends on your setting. I mean how long can your session be. I think it can be of, I think it can be a brief amount of, I mean an hour, I think we're about an hour maybe in this session and this could be half hour. A lot of people do this in half an hour. I, I don't know how you do it with this script in a half hour. To me, it's an hour and a half usually, the first session especially. One of the things I wanna close with this, in the beginning, I tried to look for common ground. When was the last time you agreed? I mean you're scraping and I'm thinking oh my God, points that out as a positive thing, you know, there, they didn't buy that completely. I know that but we're trying to communicate that there is some common ground in their relationship, and you can build on that as you go along in the future and say last, next time, I'd say last time we found two things, at least you came here and you well, whatever it was you were happy, you were unhappy about being here, and all that. That's common. But now maybe there's some more that you have in common. Let's build on that. So, my suggestion is look for something that they have in common even if it's very minimal. Okay, while I was trying to, just to wrap this up, now we've only got about a minute or so, uhm, I was, I was trying to explore what they wanted and how they're spending their time, their lives together, inserting self-evaluation questions, getting them to make plans. Why, so that they can make better choices so that each of them can control their own behavior more effectively. And you'll notice I tried to focus on the relationships, even using the little analogy of the yarn. I don't know how or where I got that but it just occurred to me at that moment, to try to, to, to get them to look beyond the problem, but to look at the relationship, so that's what I was trying to accomplish. And I hope this has been useful to you and thank you very much for listening and watching, and ah, using the ideas.
