CROSS-CULTURAL COUNSELING WRITTEN BY ALLEN E. IVEY LANETTE S. SHIZURU 

00:00:00
CLIENT  Good afternoon. I'm, I'm very sad. 

00:00:10
COUNSELOR  What seems to be the problem? 

00:00:15
CLIENT I'm very sad. You know, we, I always have problem with my husband. I'm very sad. I don't know what I'm going to cope with him. 

00:00:25
THREE CLIENTS WILL NOW BE PRESENTED. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO EACH? 

00:00:25
KATHY KAVANAGH  My family and I have a problem and the problem has to do with the relationship of my nuclear family, my husband and my children and myself with my parents and his parents. The problem also involves the fact that my husband and I adopted several children of different races and it's the acceptance of these children as grandchildren by our parents that, that is the problem. 

00:01:00
[sil.] 

00:01:00
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  My family and I have a problem. Well actually, I guess it's my problem. Uhm, I'm 28 years old and I'm still at home, I live at home and all my friends have their own apartments and, I think I should move out but I feel kind of badly about it and I don't know how to talk to my parents. And so I'm still at home and I'm still having problems. 

00:01:35
[sil.] 

00:01:35
GREG CHUN  Yeah, my family and I, we did(ph) have problem and I don't know, maybe it's my problem but we (inaudible ) disagreement, you know, like my parents, they like me to go school, you know? I just (inaudible ) high school and they like me to go college that, but, ah, I don't really wanna do that, you know? I got some other ideas, maybe to find my job or something like that. So things between me and my parents need, need to cool right now. 

00:02:10
[sil.] 

00:02:10
LANETTE S. SHIZURU  Hi! I'm Lanette Shizuru and this is Allen Ivey. The purpose of this tape is to raise issues about the role, culture place, and counseling. As you know, different cultures have different styles of helping and different ways of coping. Allen, do you have any experience with this? 

00:02:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, ah, my own experience has been basically come up the hard way on that, in terms of, I started out saying that counseling was a generic process. It's, it would probably work the same across culture and learn to the school (inaudible )that different cultures do indeed respond differently. For example, in the U.S. we tend to respond to the individual using the word you, I, very much in how the individual want to make his or her decision. Whereas for example, the Japanese culture, a different emphasis, I found is, is more appropriate. What would that be? 

00:03:00
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, I think in the Asian cultures, what is more important is a relational type of, ah, systems approach to counseling. Well, what's really important is not just individual what they can do but really how the person fits in a group process and how a harmony can be reached with the person to adopt better or acculturate better, not only with his own culture but also with the majority of white culture. 

00:03:25
ALLEN E. IVEY There's been a movement of course, Lanette, toward family therapy and toward assistant view in counseling, a psychotherapy, yet most individual counseling still focuses on the individual and his or her feelings. The particular set of tapes we're going to show, ah, coming up shortly will focus, first of all, we'll have a white pair doing what we call a Rogerian style of counseling focusing very much on the individual and her feelings. Second tape is a Japanese, ah, counseling interview and the, the focus of this is going to be a little different. 

00:03:55
LANETTE S. SHIZURU That's right, and the focus on the second tape was really on how the person fit in with their family and what, how you could raise the family's awareness of what the person was going through and how the family maybe could help the individual. So a lot more emphasis was placed on communication skills or what the group really felt about this, not just how the individual felt. We started with the individual but we really wanna work through harmony of how the support system can help the individual to cope. 

00:04:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And finally you're gonna see a third tape in which we have disharmony. Two cultures working together and ending up, in effect, a culture conflict. Anything you want to add the show, before we show these last three tapes? 

00:04:30
LANETTE S. SHIZURU I think the important point about the last tape in terms of the culture conflict is really that the counseling situation is really a culture in itself. And the person has come in with a culture of his own and what's really debilitating to that person is that counseling per se is a very western perspective. Coming in to an office, talking to someone, sharing their feelings, is really not some, not the way a lot of people wanna be helped. They're looking for something else. 

00:04:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So at this point, let's look at three counseling, short counseling vignettes, role plays to get some idea of some alternative approaches to the counseling process. Okay? 

00:05:05
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Okay. 

00:05:05
INTERVIEW ONE: CAUCASIAN DYAD 

00:05:05
LARRY SHOHET Good morning. Ah, you're Kathy? 

00:05:20
KATHY KAVANAGH Uh hmm. 

00:05:20
LARRY SHOHET My name is Larry and hi. I'm a social worker here and, ah, I understand that, ah, you wanted to, ah, talk over some stuff. So, ah, maybe you could help me by understanding what brings you in here today. 

00:05:35
KATHY KAVANAGH Okay, I'll try to explain it. ah, my husband and I, uhm, adopt, we have three children and two of them are adopted. They're different, different races and, ah, this, you know, we're, we're at peace with this. We're really glad we did it. We've never regretted it. We are now though on the verge of moving his company, he's moving them back home, to his home, in his parents, very much, and my parents are there also. And they've really, they opposed the adoptions and they, uhm, you know, they've learned to tolerate us over the years when we go home for a couple of days at a time but living next door is going to be different. I'm, I'm just really worried about how to handle this relationship with our parents who are still important to us even though I knew, we, we knew they oppose to, to, when we adopted the kids and we made that decision to go ahead and do it anyhow and that's okay but we're also concerned about the other relationship. 

00:06:35
LARRY SHOHET Well, as you, uhm, imagine what life is gonna be like once you get back to the, ah, town where your, your parents and his parents live. What kinds of things, ah, you think might happen with you? 

00:06:50
KATHY KAVANAGH I'm afraid that it would probably be like when we first started bringing the kids home and, uhm, it was a novelty at first. Relatives came out of the (inaudible ) we haven't seen in years and they showed up to see the kids. 

00:07:05
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
KATHY KAVANAGH Uhm, you know, that, you can handle that a little when the kids were young and the kids didn't know the difference 'coz they can't keep track of all those relatives anyhow. But I'm worried now that the kids are in their early teens and they will know if they're treated differently and that's what I'm worried about. 

00:07:25
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
KATHY KAVANAGH 'Coz each, his parents and my parents both have other grandchildren and they tend to see our adopted children differently than they see their biological grandchildren. 

00:07:35
LARRY SHOHET What is it specifically, if you can, if you can think about it that. 

00:07:40
KATHY KAVANAGH In how they are treated differently? 

00:07:40
LARRY SHOHET No, no. What is it specifically that goes on with you as you have seen these kinds of things happen in the past and as you think about, ah, the kinds of things that are likely to happen in the future once you get back? What comes to mind in terms of how you feel about all of these? 

00:08:00
KATHY KAVANAGH I guess I'm really fearful that, uhm, that the relationship will become confronting(ph), that it won't be a peaceful one anymore because of the intensity of living near each other and the expectations of seeing more of each other, which to now because we've lived away, it wasn't there, you know? They knew we could only get home occasionally, once or twice a year or something. And I, the smooth relationships with my in-laws and my parents are important to me and they are to my husband too. And, ah, we both come from large families and we just don't like to see that relationship threatened. So, I guess I, I resent(ph) their, their, uhm, what to me is a limitation that they can't accept the children and yet, I can understand it, but it's easier to understand it from far away. 

00:09:00
LARRY SHOHET That's a very difficult situation. On the one hand, ah, you're really concerned about wanting to have harmonious relationships between yourself and your family and, ah, you your parents, your husband's parents and at the same time you're also afraid that, ah, because of their feelings about your adopted children that, ah, it may be very difficult for things to go smoothly. Is that. 

00:09:30
KATHY KAVANAGH Yeah, and I'm afraid for the kids 'coz, I don't want them to feel like they're different. 

00:09:35
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm, what do you think you can do, to, uhm, ah, help to bring about a more favorable kind of interaction between all of these people? 

00:09:45
KATHY KAVANAGH  I don't really know, and I guess part of why I'm here is because I can't anticipate what, all of what might happen, and that makes me more afraid than if I could anticipate it. 

00:10:00
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
KATHY KAVANAGH But I've learned from having, ah, a multi racial family for this many years that a lot of the fears we had didn't happen but a lot of things we didn't anticipate did happen. And I can't anticipate everything that will happen when we go back and guess it's, you know, the biggest thing- (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
KATHY KAVANAGH - that bothers me. 

00:10:20
LARRY SHOHET Of course it's gonna be- (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
KATHY KAVANAGH - that I'm thinking here. (ph) 

00:10:20
LARRY SHOHET (inaudible ) 

00:10:25
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Uhm, well, what's been going on here? I'd like you, folks, explain what you've been doing. Cathy, how do you feel about this interview? 

00:10:30
KATHY KAVANAGH It feels comfortable because Larry is asking me how I, letting me express myself, and that's really what I came for. I don't know that there's any one answer or if I knew what, what to have done I would have, you know, it already be in action or I would have done it already. Over the years we've maintained, uhm, a decent relationship, fairly good, I think under the circumstances, and he's letting me - that my fears about what might come. 

00:11:00
LANETTE S. SHIZURU And Larry, what was, ah, your purpose in the way you handle this interview that Cathy spoke(ph)? 

00:11:05
LARRY SHOHET  Well, it became evident, ah, within a few seconds after the interview began, that, ah, Cathy was, ah, in conflict about the problem which she mentioned and, ah, I felt that there were a couple of things that needed to happen. The first thing and the most important thing was she needed to have an opportunity to express that conflict clearly and get some support, ah, acknowledging the legitimacy of that conflict and, uhm, an indication of the willingness on my part to try to help. And, ah, my plan really, uhm, which I was about to put into action, just at the point that you joined us, uhm, was to begin to talk about some of the specific kinds of things that might come up, and to talk about how she's handled some of those thing sin the past, what worked, what didn't work, uhm, as a way of helping her kind of explore the dimensions of, uhm, of the relationships and how she could intervene, ah, to, ah, perhaps do some things differently than happened in the past in a way that would make things go better. Obviously, my focus in this interview was pretty much exclusively on Cathy. 

00:12:20
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
LARRY SHOHET I really didn't get into how the other members of her family or her parents' family or her husband's parents' family, ah, were reacting to this because I felt at this point that really what was important was to get at her feelings and to help her to deal with some of those issues. 

00:12:40
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Okay, I think that's a really important point that this is a pretty traditional type of counseling situation where a lot of your verbalizations was on Cathy's feelings and how she would deal with them. In fact, what you wanted to find out was what she could do, you know, as an individual to like maybe change her feelings or change her perceptions of, of how this, ah, situation could be changed and it was very little of may be thinking of being, maybe her husband and with her, how did you feel with that Cathy? 

00:13:05
KATHY KAVANAGH  It felt good because at this point it is my problem. We, the family hasn't experienced the whole thing. We, we talk about it in the family but it's my fear and it felt appropriate for Larry to deal with it as my, you know, my problem. 

00:13:20
LANETTE S. SHIZURU  I think that's another distinction that should be made with western type of counseling is that, the responsibility is always put on the client, you know? That you will hear putting the responsibility to change on Cathy, wherein some other type of counseling styles, it may be, and just, not only your, it's your fault and you should change but maybe bringing in someone in and let's see how we can work together to fix it. 

00:13:45
INTERVIEW TWO: JAPANESE - AMERICAN DYAD 

00:13:45
LANETTE S. SHIZURU  Hi Naomi. 

00:13:55
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Hi. 

00:13:55
LANETTE S. SHIZURU I'm glad to see you. Why did you come to see me today? 

00:13:55
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  Oh, I'm kind of feeling badly today. Um, I'm, kinda, having problems with my family, I guess. 

00:14:05
LANETTE S. SHIZURU  You want to explain a little more to me? 

00:14:10
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Well, ah, I'm still living at home and, ah, I kinda wanna move out because all my friends have moved out. But, ah, I don't know how to talk to my parents about it. I've tried but they don't, you know, but they don't listen. But I really wanna move out. 

00:14:30
LANETTE S. SHIZURU So you're having some problems with you're parents? 

00:14:30
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  Yeah, and I can't sleep too well either, not concentrating like school work is doing kinda badly now. So, I don't know, you know, I don't want to flunk out. So I, I came in. 

00:14:45
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, yes, we don't want you to flunk out. So, well maybe you could explain what kind of problems you're having with you're family. 

00:14:50
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  Well, you know, I, I wanna move out and every time I, I talk about it with them they just, you know, kind of, ignore me or they don't, they don't answer. So I guess they don't want me to move out. So I don't know what to do. 

00:15:10
LANETTE S. SHIZURU How does that make you feel when they don't answer? 

00:15:10
NAOMI TAKEMOTO It makes, I guess, it makes me feel, kind of, uhm, hurt, kinda, angry I guess. 

00:15:20
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Hmm. So you don't think your parents understand you? 

00:15:25
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Uh hmm, they don't understand me. 

00:15:25
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Hmm. Well, I have the same problem with you. So, maybe I can help you out a little bit. Maybe. 

00:15:35
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Do you think I should move out? 

00:15:35
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, I think we should talk about it a bit more and then maybe we could find out why your parents don't want you to move out and then we can make up your mind and we can decide what we can do. 

00:15:45
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  I know my parents don't want me to move out. I know that already. 

00:15:50
LANETTE S. SHIZURU  How, how can you tell? 

00:15:55
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Well, 'coz every time I talk about it they don't wanna talk about it, you know? I know they don't want me to move out. 

00:16:00
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, do you know why they don't want you to move out? 

00:16:00
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  Well, they want me to take care of them, I guess. Why can't they (inaudible ) all my life? 

00:16:10
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, that would be difficult, wouldn't it? 

00:16:10
NAOMI TAKEMOTO I, I don't want to take care of them all my life. 

00:16:15
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, do you understand that your parents feel that if you move out you're abandoning them and that you're ungrateful? 

00:16:20
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Is that what they think, do you think? 

00:16:25
LANETTE S. SHIZURU I think so. I don't think maybe they think you don't love them anymore. I know you, I know you really love them because if you didn't love them you wouldn't come and talk to me about this, you would just move out. So you're a really caring person but, you know, we, I think we have to make your family understand that you're not the same generation as them and that, you know, you have your own life and you want to go. 

00:16:45
NAOMI TAKEMOTO How am I gonna make them understand that? 

00:16:50
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, we'll have to try and find that out. 

00:16:50
NAOMI TAKEMOTO I didn't tell them I came here. 

00:16:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm going to break in here at this point and say this is an interview which is being handled in very different way than being handled in, ah, say a white on white counseling session for example. The emphasis would be more on the individual. The emphasis here is more on relationship. Ah, could you two elaborate more what's going on here, what you see, particularly Naomi that you like to say? 

00:17:10
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  Well I was trying to portray a woman who's torn between her desires to be independent, to be an individual. 

00:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
NAOMI TAKEMOTO And also pulled by her obligations to the family and a person who's in quandary over which way to go. 

00:17:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And in traditional western counseling i.e. before family therapy began to change our view, we would tend to focus on you as individual and ignore the family where you have been very much been focusing on her feelings and also on the family feelings. Is that, am I right in that? 

00:17:40
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Yeah, I think it's important, uhm, for Naomi to understand that she does see this as a relational problem because if it was only individual thing she would just move out totally, she wouldn't even come here. And so she has to understand that her problem is her concern of this, keeping this relationship with her parents good as well as satisfying her own needs and becoming independent and it's really, uhm, a culture conflict because in her age group, it would be alright to move out. Other people are doing it, but from her parents' point of view, that's not alright. Now I was trying to make her feel or make her see how her parents really view this so she could understand it better and maybe that way, uhm, improve the communications between the two groups. 

00:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Now earlier, uh, and that we talked about the concept of harmony, being particularly important in, uh, Japanese culture, you might elaborate a little bit how you see the concept of harmony fitting in with this particular session? 

00:18:35
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, I think for Naomi's well being, she has to be in Harmony not only with herself and her peers but also herself and her family because actually she wants everything to be, everyone to be happy, her parents to be satisfied with her, and herself to be satisfied with herself. And sometimes the two aren't in harmony. The two groups aren't in harmony so she has to find a way to bridge the two groups. 

00:19:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And wow does that sound to you Naomi? 

00:19:00
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Uh hmm, that sounds really, uhm, good. I think it was also good how you pointed out that it was okay, that I felt this obligation to a family. And I think, uhm, a western counselor might not have said that. 

00:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now, you are a clinical psychologist, how would you imagine typical western clinical psychologist might have approached the same problem? 

00:19:20
NAOMI TAKEMOTO Uhm, I'm not a clinical psychologist yet. 

00:19:20
ALLEN E. IVEY On your way. 

00:19:20
NAOMI TAKEMOTO  Uhm, I think a western psychologist might have focused in, uh, specifically on how the individual felt about not being independent and focusing on the problem of dependency perhaps that's being a bad thing. And I think in the, the oriental culture, dependency is a fact of life and it's looked at as a very positive, uhm, aspect. 

00:19:45
INTERVIEW THREE: CULTURAL CONFLICT 

00:19:45
COUNSELOR  Hey Greg, how's it? 

00:19:55
GREG CHUN How's it. 

00:19:55
COUNSELOR  What brings you here today? 

00:20:00
GREG CHUN  Well, uh, I guess, I guess I'm having, having some, some hassles with my family, yeah. 

00:20:10
COUNSELOR  What seems to be the problem? 

00:20:15
GREG CHUN  Well, uh, see, my father and my mother, they, they really are what you call, they really value education. So like, you know, I just went for high school and, uh, you know, they like me to go on to college, uh, go, go school some more. 

00:20:40
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
GREG CHUN But, uh, that's, that's not really what I wanna do. I, I, I don't want, wanna go to school for right now. 

00:20:50
COUNSELOR  Well have you talked to them or something happened? Or. 

00:20:55
GREG CHUN  Yeah, yeah. We talk, we talk, you know, we just, you know, argue and fight. 

00:21:05
COUNSELOR  Ah, are you still living at home right now? 

00:21:10
GREG CHUN Yeah, why? 

00:21:10
COUNSELOR  What, what, ah, do, do you have in mind, you wanna move out or you want to go to work or you want to do something on your own? 

00:21:20
GREG CHUN Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, you know, I, I've been thinking about maybe trying another job or, you know, try, try to start out on my own or something, you know, something like that. 

00:21:30
COUNSELOR  Why, why are they trying to stop you? 

00:21:35
GREG CHUN  Well they just like me to go school, I see, and I don'like to go to school. 

00:21:45
COUNSELOR Have you tried to sit down and talk to them? Who it seems to be the, the biggest problem, the mother, your father? 

00:21:55
GREG CHUN Well, you know, they, they, they both get into it. Like my father, he, you know, he's a little bit more, you know, but I told you that already. 

00:22:05
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. What would you like to do then, just go to work? 

00:22:10
GREG CHUN  To have a work (inaudible ), yeah. 

00:22:17
COUNSELOR  Ah, maybe you can tell me a little bit more about, ah, the family maybe. Is that just, ah, just going to school? Are there other things than this than just the pressure of going to school? 

00:22:35
GREG CHUN What do you mean, the family? 

00:22:35
COUNSELOR Well, you know, uhm, maybe sometimes it's just not one problem, it's a combination of other problems as well. So, I, I don't know, I don't know about your family that well, so if you can tell me a little bit. 

00:22:50
GREG CHUN Well, I, I just told you, you know? They let me to go school and I don't like to go school. I like to work. 

00:22:55
COUNSELOR You have brothers and sisters? 

00:22:55
GREG CHUN  What, what does that have to do with, do with this right here? 

00:23:00
COUNSELOR Ah, let's say that I don't know your family, right? So that if you have, uhm, older brothers and sisters and they're all going to school and maybe that's what they want you to do. They expect from you. 

00:23:15
GREG CHUN Hey, that don't matter right? What matters is what I like to do, right? 

00:23:20
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
GREG CHUN Okay, but why we have to talk about my brothers and my sisters for? What are the problems? It's not your business. I came here and I explained to you what the problem was already. Do you understand where I'm coming from? 

00:23:30
COUNSELOR Yes, and then it might help to look into you problem right? 

00:23:35
GREG CHUN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:23:35
COUNSELOR How can I look into your problem if I, you don't tell me what's going on? 

00:23:40
GREG CHUN I told you. I like to go work. 

00:23:40
COUNSELOR  Well, I just asked you if, ah, you know, maybe, that it's not just the problem of going to work or going to college. Maybe there are other things involved. So. 

00:23:50
GREG CHUN Wait, wait, wait. 

00:23:50
COUNSELOR I just asked if you have brothers and sisters. 

00:23:55
GREG CHUN That has nothing to do what we're talking about here. I told you, I like to go work. My parents like me to go school and that's it. You understand where I'm coming from? 

00:24:05
COUNSELOR Uh hmm, yeah, I understand that. That's a big problem, Greg. But, ah, I would, like I said, there might be other problems than just, ah, going to work and.(crosstalk) 

00:24:15
GREG CHUN Well, if there are other problems.(crosstalk) 

00:24:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay, let me hear with the two of you just a moment and say, what's going on here, what are some of your experiences in this interview, Greg? 

00:24:25
GREG CHUN I feel like, you know, he's really pushing me. He wants, he wants me to get into some areas that, you know, is not relevant here. 

00:24:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
GREG CHUN I got, I got a problem and I want to get a job and that's what I wanna talk about, not my family. 

00:24:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. I see, so in fact you'd like to get some action, some thing is happening. 

00:24:40
GREG CHUN  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:24:45
ALLEN E. IVEY What specifically is he probably doing on that is kinda getting to you here? 

00:24:45
GREG CHUN  He's talking, you know, he's asking, ah, what other family problems do I have if my brothers and sisters go to school and stuff like that. That has nothing to do with what we're talking about here. 

00:25:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So what we have here is, like, almost a problem in culture conflict that often occurs often occurs in the counseling relationship, probably comes from the, the ocean culture. And what have you been trying to do from you're point of view, (inaudible )? 

00:25:12
COUNSELOR Um, the problem seems to be so clear cut that I, I would not think that it's just, just that, if it's just that, then I might off, gonna go off different ways and that, that's it, then there won't be any more problem. Besides he graduate form, ah, high school. ah, what I was getting at is that he is really in conflict, ah, with something. It might, ah, I feel that it's not just, ah, so that clear cut that he wants to work and the father wants to go to school but maybe the family might have something to do with, ah, him. 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So coming from your cultural background, in your view, we're talking here more in the area of relation and you would like to see him thinking more of himself in relationship to others. 

00:25:50
COUNSELOR Right. 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Whereas coming from your culture, you're saying, "I want some specific things to happen now." 

00:25:55
COUNSELOR Yeah. 

00:25:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And the relationship issue is not so important. 

00:26:00
COUNSELOR Exactly. 

00:26:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So we might wind this up in saying this is something that can and often does happen in a counseling relationship. Neither a point of you is right, neither a point of you is wrong. There's simply different ways of viewing the situation, okay? 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  When, at this last tape, involved (inaudible ) counselor counseling a Chinese client, there seems to be some problems in the interview. What were some things that you predict as particularly important for us to think about? 

00:26:30
LANETTE S. SHIZURU I think what's important about that tape, Allen, is it really shows that the counseling situation is culture bound and also the, the counselor is culture bound as well as the client, so there's a lack of communication between what's going on. Everyone comes in with their different assumptions, different values, and different ways of communicating. So what's really important in that kind of situation is for the client, as well as the counselor, to be able to communicate effectively across both of these cultures as well as within this culture bound situation of counseling? 

00:27:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So in effect, the client brings a culture, the counselor brings a culture, unless there's unreasonable message, counseling isn't going to work. 

00:27:10
LANETTE S. SHIZURU I think yes, another important thing about that, our discussion here is that we're talking about counseling on a very conceptual, a conceptual plane. I think what's really important for effective counseling is to look at it in terms of a more skilled approach. 

00:27:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, and what I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the micro skills approach to counseling. ah, the micro skills approach to counseling is concerned with breaking down the counseling process into specific teachable components. ah, before I go on on a monologue about this, is there anything you'd like to particularly have me focus on as I go into this discussion? 

00:27:45
LANETTE S. SHIZURU  Well, I'd like you to bridge the gap between the conceptual point of view of talking about the individual, the relation, and the culture and how this can be analyzed in terms of micro counseling skills and how this can be taught effectively so that each culture will use these skills but yet, in effective and appropriate way. 

00:28:05
ALLEN E. IVEY The important point basically in that, is that different, different cultural groups, apparently have different patterns of counseling skill usage, different counseling skill sequences, different ways of conceptualizing the interview. I do believe it's possible in that to break down a counseling process, analyze it and look at what specifically are different cultures using in terms of different counseling skills. At this point, I'd like to bring on, on a camera, on screen, a chart listing several single skills of microcounseling. 

00:28:35
MICROCOUNSELING SKILLS ATTENDING SKILLS: CLOSED QUESTIONS OPEN QUESTIONS MINIMAL ENCOURAGEMENT PARAPHRASE REFLECTION OF FEELINGS SUMMARIZATION INFLUENCING SKILLS: DIRECTIVE EXPRESSION OF CONTENT EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS INFLUENCING SUMMARY INTERPRETATION SELF-DISCLOSURE DIRECT - MUTUAL COMMUNICATION QUALITIES: RESPECT WARMTH GENUINESS CONFRONTATION POSITIVE REGARD IMMEDIACY CONCRETENESS 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY As we see from this chart, micro counseling is a single skills approach to the counseling or helping process. We break down counseling into single skill units so they can find rather precisely and taught systematically one at a time through the use of videotape. The purpose of this particular tape is not to get into depth on the micro skills approach. There are avenues toward this. What is important is to be aware that different cultures have different patterns of skill usage, different patterns and sequencing of the usage of the basic micro skills. In essence, we really have about 20 basic skills of micro training or micro counseling, selected out just a few skills here to illustrate a few basic points. For example, the skill of questioning, asking questions, is a single skill of the counseling process. Some cultures for example, Eskimo, Inuit, tend not to ask questions whereas in United States, in counseling theories, ah, lots of questions are asked. Different counseling theories have different frequency and amount of question-asking procedures. As you move across cultures, different cultures have different usage of these skills, paraphrasing and reflection of feeling or active listening skills are used differentially across different cultural groups. We move also to what we would, what I tend to call the influencing skills, advice, direction, information, explanation, interpretation, different cultures have different patterns of skill usage here as well. Now considering these last three interviews we've seen, the first interview, we'd saw Larry, the white counselor asking a fair number of questions but very much into paraphrasing and reflecting feelings focusing on the inconsistency that the client, Cathy, felt within herself. So the focus was on the client and using mainly the reflective listening skills. In the second session where we had two Japanese individuals, Naomi and Lanette, we saw some questioning, paraphrasing, reflection of feelings and relationship and we saw some advice, direction, also some self-disclosure and sharing of her own, ah, Lanette was sharing some of her own personal experience in relationship to Naomi. Ah, finally the third interview we saw a Laotian(ph) individual who had somewhat of a relationship orientation focusing on questioning, paraphrase, and reflective listening skills gained by his training in a psychologically oriented curriculum. In terms of debriefing this particular session with Greg, the Chinese Hawaiian individual who we of course found he would have preferred talk time at the beginning. In other words, just plain talking, sharing stories and so forth so that he would feel more comfortable. We found in many types of cases like this, the influencing skills of sharing information, advice, and so formal welcome to this type of individual than reflective listening skills. So in fact, what we've found in the micro training framework, different individuals have different patterns of skill usage. We're now going to see an interview between a white counselor, first counseling with a Fijian about an issue of personal concern and we're going to see some interesting problems, and in fact we're gonna find reflective listening approach that is used really quite skillfully by the counselor, Larry, and you'll see that it does not work well with the Fiiian, who probably would have preferred this active influencing approach to micro skills, okay? 

00:32:05
CROSS CULTURAL INTERVIEW FIJIAN CLIENT 

00:32:05
LARRY SHOHET  Well good afternoon, Kanalei. My name is Larry Shohet. Um, I'm a counselor here at the agency and, ah, it's nice to meet you. 

00:32:25
KANALEI SHUN Yeah. 

00:32:25
LARRY SHOHET And, ah, I understand that, ah, you have some things that, ah, on your mind that you wanted to talk about and why don't we begin, ah, whenever, whenever you feel comfortable? 

00:32:35
KANALEI SHUN  Okay, uhm, I guess the, my problem is, ah, basically getting adjusted to, ah, the lifestyle here. Uhm. 

00:32:45
LARRY SHOHET Hmm. 

00:32:45
KANALEI SHUN  Uhm. 

00:32:50
LARRY SHOHET And you're from, uh. 

00:32:50
KANALEI SHUN I'm from Fiji Islands. 

00:32:50
LARRY SHOHET Uh-huh. 

00:32:50
KANALEI SHUN From Fiji Islands, okay. Ah, with, with, things are a lot more clear now right, I mean, uhm, you help your friends and things are little more (inaudible ) than they are here and, ah, things are a little, a little more, they are different, very different here, you know? They're individualistic and so, uhm, ah, oftentimes I, I think I've been, I've been taken for a ride by people who just looking in the door and say, "Hey, you know, I wanna, ah, I'm selling this thing here and if you buy a little bit more of this and I get a trip, a free trip to Mexico," something like, and, ah, I've been taking it. I mean. 

00:33:25
LARRY SHOHET So you're getting a good dose of American free enterprise. 

00:33:25
KANALEI SHUN  Right, right. Yeah. 

00:33:30
LARRY SHOHET Yeah. 

00:33:30
KANALEI SHUN And, ah, I know it's, it's uncomfortable, I mean, you don't know how to be, you don't (inaudible ) feel that you're a (inaudible ) and, and, ah, I don't know. 

00:33:37
LARRY SHOHET  How long have you been here now? 

00:33:40
KANALEI SHUN Ah, well, I've been here, say, what, three, four, three or four weeks now. 

00:33:45
LARRY SHOHET Uh-huh. 

00:33:45
KANALEI SHUN So. 

00:33:45
LARRY SHOHET It must be quite a, quite a, uhm, an adjustment to have to make. It must feel like, ah, you're getting a lot of cold water thrown into your face or something. 

00:33:55
KANALEI SHUN Ah, I guess, yeah, I guess I could say that. Uhm. 

00:34:00
LARRY SHOHET But what are some of the, what are some of the, the feelings that, uhm, that go along with this kind of transitionary period? I mean, what, what, what kinds of, uhm, things have been going on in your guts? 

00:34:10
KANALEI SHUN Okay, I guess the first thing is you don't want to be, uhm, you don't know if you're like an idiot, like you've been taken for a ride. I guess that's, that's the important, that's the basic thing. 

00:34:20
LARRY SHOHET Uh-huh. What are some of the other differences between, ah, life in Fiji and, ah, your experiences so far here that maybe you're, you're finding a bit unsettling? 

00:34:30
KANALEI SHUN  Uhm, I guess the other thing is probably the fast pace. ah, things that are much, you know, things that are, are regulated, very, very much regulated in terms of time sequence(ph) and they gotta be here so and so, it gotta be here so and so. And, ah, uhm, time in Fiji is a little more lax, you don't, you know, a two o'clock appointment could be, you know, 2:15, anywhere from quarter to two to 2:15. And, ah, (inaudible ) keeping up with all this, this time table is, it can be a little, can be real (inaudible ), really. And, ah, I don't feel motivated. I mean, I, I don't have a watch and, ah, I don't feel like I have to keep time to go anywhere. I mean, if it's two o'clock and it's anywhere around two and if I get there anywhere around two that's, that's fine. ah, but, ah, you know, you get there at two, let's say five after three, it's only you miss your appointment. Your appointment was at two o'clock, you should have been there at two o'clock and, ah, (inaudible ) I'm gonna wait and just hang around until we could fit you in somewhere, you know, it could take somewhere up to two hours or something like that, just waiting around. 

00:35:35
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
KANALEI SHUN  That's another thing that's, that's difficult to adjust to. 

00:35:40
LARRY SHOHET So life is really pretty different, ah, here than ah.(crosstalk) 

00:35:45
KANALEI SHUN Oh, yeah, yeah, certainl(ph) you know. Uhm, I don't know, I don't know how does one adjusts to that. I mean how does, uhm, be part of it I guess. 

00:35:55
LARRY SHOHET  Well, maybe we ought to talk about how you've been adjusting to it so far and, ah, see if we can, uhm, identify some, some areas, ah, that you've been doing well in and look and see if we can find ways to help you, ah, to deal better with some of the other areas as well. 

00:36:15
KANALEI SHUN  Yeah. 

00:36:20
LARRY SHOHET What are, what are some of the other kinds of, of, uhm, things that you've been doing to try to, uhm, you know, to deal with some of those pressures? 

00:36:25
KANALEI SHUN  Well, I don't know, most, uhm,, I don't, T.V. kinda helps a lot, you know, I mean, you could sit down and watch T.V. and, and, ah, ah, watch how people behave and, and at least, you know, learn something about (inaudible ) especially the T.V. the, the comedian(ph) TVs like (inaudible ) you know, (inaudible ) or something like that. Ah, uhm. 

00:36:55
LARRY SHOHET It's a way of, kind of, getting an idea- (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
KANALEI SHUN Sure, yeah. 

00:37:00
LARRY SHOHET - of how things function and- (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
KANALEI SHUN Right, yeah. 

00:37:00
LARRY SHOHET - what people's expectations are and so forth, yeah. 

00:37:05
KANALEI SHUN Advertisement too, kind of, helps. 

00:37:05
LARRY SHOHET Uh-huh. 

00:37:05
KANALEI SHUN (inaudible ) what is supposed to be good, what is expected and, ah, ah, yeah, T.V. I guess helps a lot, just, just watching T.V and, ah, see how people react, how people behave. 

00:37:20
LARRY SHOHET Well, you know, uhm, one thing that strikes me about what you just said is that, uhm, it seems like, uhm, the situation has, uhm, been uncomfortable enough for you that you've kind of felt the need to, uhm, you know, keep yourself away from, uhm, people right away and, uhm, you know, you've used, uhm, the media, ah, as a way of, you know, trying to get a sense of some of the things that, that go on here without having to really directly participate. But, uhm, uhm, one of the things that, ah, I think we really need to consider together is, uhm, how you can begin to move back out again, and, ah, use the experiences, uhm, that you will have with people as a way of learning kind of the way things are here. And, and getting more comfortable. I can appreciate that, ah, you know, at the beginning it's, uhm, sometimes better than just go, you know, kind of stay away. But at some point you're gonna have to, you know, begin to move more, more directly into the, into the (inaudible ) of it. 

00:38:38
KANALEI SHUN Right. Yeah, yeah. 

00:38:38
LARRY SHOHET  Are there other, uhm, are there other, ah, Fijians, uhm, here in Hawaii that you've met? 

00:38:45
KANALEI SHUN No, I haven't met anybody. So, ah, I don't know anybody. (ph) 

00:38:50
LARRY SHOHET Well, uhm, have you had much contact with the, uhm, International Students, ah, Office here yet? 

00:39:00
KANALEI SHUN No, there is one? I didn't know, I didn't know there is one out here. 

00:39:00
LARRY SHOHET Yeah. They're located over at the, uhm, Student's Services Center which is, uhm, across the, from the post office. 

00:39:10
KANALEI SHUN Hmm. 

00:39:10
LARRY SHOHET And there are some real terrific people who work there, who know, who's here and where people are from. And one of the things that might be really helpful for you is to, uhm, find some Fijians or maybe some other Pacific Islanders from- (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
KANALEI SHUN Yeah. 

00:39:25
LARRY SHOHET - the same area who kind of gone through what you're going through already. And perhaps they could, ah, kind of, uhm, you know, help to steer you along, and at least you wouldn't feel so alone. 

00:39:35
KANALEI SHUN  Yeah, right. Well, that's, that's what I'm here for. 

00:39:40
LARRY SHOHET Uh-huh. 

00:39:40
KANALEI SHUN That's, I would like to see if there are other people around here that I could get in touch with. 

00:39:45
LARRY SHOHET Well after we've, uhm, finished for today, before you leave, I'll give you the name and telephone number of a person over at the ISO that, uhm, you might want to contact. And, ah, maybe that's a good first step anyway. 

00:40:00
KANALEI SHUN Sure. 

00:40:00
LARRY SHOHET And then we can also begin to explore some other things that we might do together to, ah, help to facilitate this transition. 

00:40:05
KANALEI SHUN Yeah, sure. That will be nice. 

00:40:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  In the interview we've just seen, Larry, the counselor, used what some might consider really quite good reflective listening skills. He began by asking questions, he paraphrased, he tuned in with feelings. And yet the interview didn't work as you noted, the problems and non-verbal communication, the gradual distancing is in fact, they almost moved away from each other during the interview. We're now going to see another cross-cultural counseling interview. This time Larry will be working with a Chinese woman. You'll see some of the same reflective listening skills but you'll also see him being more supportive. You'll notice a certain amount of gentleness and I think patience, as he attempts to understand and work within the framework of another culture. Notice that some of the similarity of the skills but also notice how very differently the skills are used in this forth coming tape. 

00:41:00
CROSS-CULTURAL INTERVIEW CHINESE-HAWAIIAN CLIENT 

00:41:00
LARRY SHOHET  Well, good afternoon, Mrs. Lee. 

00:41:10
MRS. LEE Hello. 

00:41:10
LARRY SHOHET Uhm, my name is Larry Shohet and, ah, I'm one of the people on the staff here. Ah, it's nice to meet you. I understand that, ah, there were some things, ah, on your mind that you wanted to talk about and, ah, why don't we begin whenever you'd like to begin? 

00:41:30
MRS. LEE Uh. 

00:41:30
LARRY SHOHET  And by the way, feel free if you have any questions you'd like to ask me to, just go right ahead and do so. 

00:41:40
MRS. LEE Thank you. Uhm, it's, it's about my divorce. Uhm, ah, I'm getting divorced. Ah, I, I, I filed for a divorce. 

00:41:50
LARRY SHOHET Uh-huh. 

00:41:50
MRS. LEE  And, ah, I'm having, I'm having a hard time because, uhm, my husband goes away on business and when he goes away, uhm, nobody takes care of the children. 

00:42:10
LARRY SHOHET Uh-hmm. 

00:42:10
MRS. LEE And, ah, I worry, I worry about them. Uhm... 

00:42:15
LARRY SHOHET Why, why is it that nobody takes care of the children when he's away? 

00:42:20
MRS. LEE I don't know why he, he goes away and he leaves the children a home by themselves. Uhm, when he went one time, he told the neighbor to take care of them. And he pays money to the neighbor but last week, he went away and, and he, he did not tell the neighbor to take care and I go over and nobody's there. 

00:42:45
LARRY SHOHET  I see. So you and your husband are not living together at the moment then? 

00:42:50
MRS. LEE No, I live by myself. 

00:42:55
LARRY SHOHET I see. And he's been, the children have been living with him? 

00:43:00
MRS. LEE Yes. 

00:43:00
LARRY SHOHET I see. How do you feel about that? 

00:43:05
MRS. LEE Very sad. They, they don't talk to me. 

00:43:05
LARRY SHOHET  They're, ah, unhappy with you in, in some way? 

00:43:15
MRS. LEE I don't understand why my husband, I don't know what he tells the children. But when I go to the house, they don't open the door and they don't let me inside. They don't talk to me. I, I take food because I worry. Nobody cook for them. Nobody take care of them. I take food and they, they don't open the door. 

00:43:45
LARRY SHOHET  Uh hmm, sounds very sad. 

00:43:50
MRS. LEE Yes. 

00:43:50
LARRY SHOHET  You must be feeling very unhappy about that? 

00:44:05
[sil.] 

00:44:05
MRS. LEE  I don't know what to do. I want, I want to, to take care, I want my children to be safe. 

00:44:20
LARRY SHOHET  You must be very worried. 

00:44:25
MRS. LEE Yes. 

00:44:25
LARRY SHOHET Yeah, and very unhappy about the whole situation. 

00:44:30
MRS. LEE Yes. 

00:44:30
LARRY SHOHET  May be enough to make you wanna cry? 

00:44:35
MRS. LEE  I cry lots sometimes. 

00:44:40
MRS. LEE  I don't know what to do. 

00:44:50
LARRY SHOHET Ma'am, are you working also? 

00:44:50
MRS. LEE Yes. 

00:44:50
LARRY SHOHET  And, ah, do, uhm, either you or your husband have relatives here? 

00:45:00
MRS. LEE  No, nobody. 

00:45:05
LARRY SHOHET So there's really nobody else to- (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
MRS. LEE No. 

00:45:05
LARRY SHOHET - to help. 

00:45:05
MRS. LEE No. We, we come from China. So, there's no family here. 

00:45:10
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm. Well that really makes it difficult. Well, I can really understand how, ah, worried and upset you must feel. 

00:45:25
MRS. LEE Uh-hmm. 

00:45:25
LARRY SHOHET And what's the, ah, the situation between, ah, between you and your husband? I gather that, ah, since you're not living together, there's, ah, some, ah, difficulty in marriage? 

00:45:40
MRS. LEE  Yes. Uhm, I, I cannot have money. I, I work for somebody, for a family. I take care of their children and I cook. 

00:46:00
LARRY SHOHET Uh hmm. 

00:46:00
MRS. LEE So I live at their house and I take care of myself. Uhm, my husband spends plenty of money and many years now, he spends plenty of money, uhm, many bills, he does not pay. So I must pay. 

00:46:25
LARRY SHOHET Hmm. 

00:46:25
MRS. LEE Ah, he does not give me money and children too. I work. 

00:46:35
LARRY SHOHET  That's pretty unusual kind of situation. 

00:46:40
MRS. LEE  Well I have to help my husband and we have hard time. So when he doesn't have job I have to help him. 

00:46:50
LARRY SHOHET You're very loyal to him. 

00:46:55
MRS. LEE  But now I get divorced. 

00:47:00
LARRY SHOHET  Well, I'd like to talk with you some more about that but, uhm, beforehand, and I hope I'm not prying too much and I hope you feel free to tell me if I am. Uhm, but what is it that, ah, your children are so, uhm, angry with you about? Why is it that they. 

00:47:25
MRS. LEE I do not know. That, that upsets me. I, I do not know. Uhm, I, I take, for many years now, it's always my husband and the two children against me. He tells them not, not to like me or before when I live same house, when I take shower, the children turn off the water. I, I do not know why they do that. Uhm, my husband tell them these things. Uhm, when, when we live in the mainland, no money, my husband say we save money. Winter time snowing, no more heat, he turn off all the heat. He buy sleeping bag. He buys three sleeping bag for him and the two children only, no more for me. 

00:48:35
LARRY SHOHET  Uh hmm. So you feel kind of cast a drift at sea huh? Just all on your own with ah- (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
MRS. LEE Yes. 

00:48:50
LARRY SHOHET - no support at all from anybody in the family. 

00:48:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  We've seen, ah, several incidences of cross-cultural counseling. The last one was ineffective and effective use of cross-cultural counseling skills. And yet, we got this way(ph) from, certainly this is from a micro skills, an individual relationship point of view. I think there are other ways that these, these, these individual interviews could be analyzed. What are some of the things that occurred to you that, particularly, where, where could people go from here in terms of thinking about improving cross-cultural counseling skills? 

00:49:25
LANETTE S. SHIZURU Well, I think what really important in improving cross-cultural counseling skills is the knowledge of the culture in one level, the conceptual level of knowing what the person really expects, maybe trying to find out what really is the problem from the client's point of view, the perspective from his culture and then trying to use the increased communication skills and trying to unbridge(ph) that gap by effectively working together in making the counseling situation a culture in and of itself. So that the two people can work together and come at, come out with the outcome that both are satisfied with. 

00:50:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, Lanette, I'd really like to underline one thing you're saying particularly is that counseling in western society is usually considered as an individual process. And the whole idea of thinking of context and relationship and the idea of the culture is present in every individual interview is absolutely, I think, essential, and perhaps a place to start. Counseling, I think, starts with the individual and then occasionally thinks about culture. I'm thinking more and more of the culture off the bracket, the individual interview far more than it does.

LANETTE S. SHIZURU I think that's really true, what's really important that counseling should be seen as a process with a context, a content, and in the end, an outcome. And the outcome should be a compromise between all of these interactions between the environment and the person.

ALLEN E. IVEY  And so to wind up here, I think some places people can go is learning more about different cultures, studying the skills used by natural helpers- (crosstalk)

LANETTE S. SHIZURU Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - in each individual culture. And then not getting involved with what we could call cultural imperialism, imposing a single western point of view upon other people. So, thanks so much for participating. Thank you, Lanette.
