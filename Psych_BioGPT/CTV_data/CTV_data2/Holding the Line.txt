Holding the Line Using the telephone to offer counseling, support or information. A training package from the School of Social Studies University of Wales College Newport UWCN 

00:00:35
NORMA JAMES Hello I am Norma James. 

00:00:35
MIKE SIMMONS And I am Mike Simmons. This program has been made for anyone who offers any kind of helping service over the phone. It could be a telephone counselor but it could equally be someone offering support, advice or information on a helpline of some sort. The themes will be considering throughout of what anyone who uses the telephone as a means of offering help needs to bear in mind. Be their counselor, a helpline operator or whatever. 

00:01:05
NORMA JAMES The use of the phone has become common place and it has become almost as popular means of communicating has became face to face, particularly amongst young people. It shouldn’t be a surprise then with the telephone now provides many people with the primary needs of accessing information and seeking support. Growing number of counselors and others working within the caring professions have recognized that not only may some people be bad to served through telephone support but that the use of this technology can make counseling or the provision of support accessible and acceptable to avoid a range of people. 

00:01:45
MIKE SIMMONS And that’s what this program is all about, whether you are working on a helpline using the phone as a way of giving advice or information or exploring the possibilities of telephone counseling, we'll be looking at the issues that are likely to confront you if you engage in this kind of work. It’s perhaps worth mentioning that we’re assuming that you’re already familiar with the rage of basic communication skills under experienced in using them. Though we’ll certainly be looking at these skills what we’re really aiming to do here is to point out how they can be used most effectively over the telephone. 

00:02:25
NORMA JAMES And there is no doubt about it, using the telephone does have an impact. 

00:02:30
MIKE SIMMONS Not the least of these is the two parties concerned can’t actually see each other and that the level of fidelity provided by telephone the mobile or landline is not always what it might be. So first of all let’s consider, why someone should choose to get help over the telephone. 

00:02:50
Why use a phone? 

00:02:55
NORMA JAMES It’s readily available to just about everybody, people with the disability for example are those who are unable to leave home easily, shift workers, students, those who feel anxious about speaking to people face to face may all feel happier talking over the phone. 

00:03:15
MIKE SIMMONS Geographical location is less of an issue, it’s easy to make a call to Glasgow as it to Cardiff or London. I can choose to call an agency long way away from my home either because our particular agency has specific expertise or because the distance between us will help to preserve my anonymity. 

00:03:35
NORMA JAMES It’s convenient, most people have a telephone or have easy access to one. 

00:03:40
MIKE SIMMONS It’s confidential, it’s generally not too difficult to use the telephone without being overheard by anybody. 

00:03:45
NORMA JAMES And it’s anonymous not only can a caller use the phone without anybody knowing but the person taking our call will only know as much about the caller as he or she wishes to make known. There is something important about the issue of control here, the caller can choose where to call and when to make the call and can also choose how long it’s going to last. Anyone making what feels like a difficult call is going to feel much more confident about making it if they know that they can hang up whenever they choose. 

00:04:25
MIKE SIMMONS Of course some of these benefits apply equally to the person taking the call, he or she can also be as anonymous as they need to be and the telephone could also be a very convenient way of offering help. 

00:04:35
HELEN Hello, this is the community helpline, my name is Helen, how can I help you? 

00:04:40
MIKE SIMMONS Helping agencies are not restricted so much by where they might be situated and there are many telephone helpers who are able to work from their own homes. The telephone also offers a greater level of safety to the person taking the call particularly after hours. This is not to suggest the face to face work automatically presents a danger but there is clearly greater safety at the end of the telephone. 

00:05:10
Problems with using the phone 

00:05:15
NORMA JAMES There are lot of good reasons to explain why someone might turn to the telephone for help. But it’s not all good news there are a number of significant implications which we need to be aware of and to bring to the awareness of our callers too. 

00:05:35
MIKE SIMMONS What stands off as being a private telephone call can always run the risk of being interrupted perhaps by member of the family or chance visitor. Though a caller may think they’re not going to be disturbed they can seldom have the same guarantee with face to face work office. The listener needs to make the caller aware of this and to agree on a strategy as to what should happen if there is an interruption. 

00:06:05
NORMA JAMES The very technology that makes telephone communication possible also increases the chances of someone discovering that help us being sort. Pressing redial will allow any one to discover the last caller was made on a particular phone while dialing 1471, will reveal, who made the last incoming call. 

00:06:25
7815… 

00:06:25
NORMA JAMES Because people tend to phone have plans most spontaneously than engage in face to face work it’s important the listener point these things out to the caller. Otherwise they might not realize the implications of what they’re doing until it’s too late. If they don’t want anybody to know that they’ve called us for example then they need to be told to call another number after they’ve hung up. So that our number won’t be stored in the phones memory. 

00:07:00
MIKE SIMMONS Again the caller is likely to make more assumptions than they would in face to face work. They might assume that they’re speaking to someone entirely on their own for example and this might not necessarily be true, they might also assume that they would speak to the same person if they made a subsequent call on another day. And that also might be untrue. Some agencies actually think it’s not appropriate for caller to build up relationships with particular listeners and we’ll keep rotating shifts so that this is less likely to happen. The important thing is for the listener to ensure that the callers know what the deal actually is, that the assumptions are acknowledged and clarified. 

00:07:40
NORMA JAMES There are also some negative implications for the helper. Because there is no visual contact what is actually heard is all there is for the listener to go on when they try to get a sense of the caller’s world. As we’ve already suggested, phone lines are not always as clear as they might be particularly when the caller is using a mobile phone and this only makes the work harder. 

00:08:10
MIKE SIMMONS With said that an advantage of telephone contact to the caller is that they’re more in control than they would feel in face to face work and can terminate the call whenever they wish. The impact of this on the listener can be quite significant though and can leave them feeling deskilled and disoriented and some how responsible for the contact ending as it did. 

00:08:30
NORMA JAMES The random nature of some telephone work can also make it very stressful and demanding for the listener, since it’s generally impossible to know who will call, when they’ll call, what they were want to talk about and how long the call will take. 

00:08:50
MIKE SIMMONS Some times people make the mistake of seeing help being offered in this way as being some kind of easy option, nothing could be further from the truth. It may well be cost effective and it can certainly be of great value to the users of such a service, but it’s also hugely challenging and demanding. As we’ve already said this program is not going to be teaching you basic communication skills, we have to assume that you’re already fairly familiar with them. We’d also expect you to be aware of what had become know as the call conditions, the empathy congruence, an unconditional positive regard and if you’re not just to be aware of them, but to be trying to put them into practice too. 

00:09:35
:are you in zennor? A shameless plug! Things to bear in mind 

00:09:35
NORMA JAMES If you feel unfamiliar with any of this or just feel like brushing up on anything then this is the moment for us to mention “Are You In Zennor” our counseling skills training program. You’ll find a trailer for it at the end of this program. So what do we need to bare in mind when we’re working on the telephone. We need to be clear communicators. 

00:10:00
MIKE SIMMONS We need to be comfortable with being more actively involved in the conversation than we’d in face to face work. 

00:10:05
NORMA JAMES If we’re not come to know who is going to ring, male, female, young, old or what the call will be about or when the call will be made or if the call will remain on line or unless it’s been decided before hung by the agency how long the call will last then we’re going to need to be calm, patient, flexible, spontaneous and understanding of the needs of those who call us, that’s much easier said than done of course so it might be fair to say that we’re going to need to be working towards being calm, patient, flexible and so on. 

00:10:45
MIKE SIMMONS As telephone helpers will may be more likely to find ourselves having to deal with angry, abusive, highly distressed and/or suicidal calls and hoax calls too. This means that we need to be sufficiently, emotionally stable and self aware to be able to work with such course to the benefit of the caller, again a pretty challenging task. 

00:11:10
NORMA JAMES And finally and this may be pretty obvious, we need to feel comfortable using the phone and not everybody is. 

00:11:20
Telephone helping skills 

00:11:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay so that’s what telephone helpers have to be. Now let’s look at what they have to do, how we can put it all into practice. Some of this will be familiar to anyone whose job it is to listen to someone who is confused, distressed or uncertain. Some of it however will be less so. If we look at any call with the successful outcome will see that it follows a fairly predictable pattern, within that pattern there are number of tasks and skills which we need to have under about. 

00:11:55
welcome to the caller Listen Retain Contact Respond Clarify Provide Information Refer on Keep Notes Inform End the call 

00:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS If we have to work effectively we need to welcome and engage with the caller. 

00:12:05
NORMA JAMES To listen to them. 

00:12:05
MIKE SIMMONS We need to keep in contact with them for the duration of the call. 

00:12:10
NORMA JAMES To respond to what they’re saying. 

00:12:10
MIKE SIMMONS To clarify what they’re saying, when such clarification is needed. 

00:12:15
NORMA JAMES To provide information if that’s part of the function of the agency we working for. 

00:12:20
MIKE SIMMONS To be able to refer a call on to some more appropriate agency if that’s necessary. 

00:12:25
NORMA JAMES To keep the effective notes. 

00:12:25
MIKE SIMMONS To inform the caller of the nature of the service that we’re able to offer. 

00:12:30
NORMA JAMES And to end the call appropriately. 

00:12:35
MIKE SIMMONS So, let’s make a start and looking at all this. 

00:12:40
Welcoming the Caller 

00:12:45
MIKE SIMMONS Think about what is like for someone who decides to make a call, they will probably have deliberated about it for sometime agonized about it may be. They found the number to call thought about making the call and then put it off, they thought about again and rehearse what they were going to say and put it off again and finally made the call and we answer. For a style they might be surprised to find that they’re not talking to an answering machine horrified even. They might not feel that confident about expressing themselves clearly, the use of the English might not be that good, they almost certainly going to be feeling pretty anxious may be they’ve made a call before and haven’t felt listen to them, may be this call is going to be just that same as that one they think and that’s probably going to make it even harder for them to express themselves clearly. How we respond in those first few minutes is going to be crucial. 

00:13:50
NORMA JAMES We need to be welcoming unhurried and clear, we need to give them a chance to say what they need to say. We need to give them a chance to collect themselves and this process begins even before the conversation does, it’s useful for both the caller and the telephone helper to let the phone ring three or four times before the call is answered. This gives us both the moment to gather our thoughts and to begin focusing on the call that we’re about to engaging. 

00:14:20
MIKE SIMMONS Have a look at this it’s a clip from unscripted roll play we made for this program. 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:35
NORMA JAMES Hello you are through to the community helpline ah… my name is Norma how can I help you? 

00:14:40
I, I don’t know whether you can help me, my friend told me about you. Um… 

00:14:45
NORMA JAMES What did she say? 

00:14:50
What she said, she phoned you up once and you’re really nice and I, I just need somebody to talk to I am just so confused. 

00:14:55
MIKE SIMMONS You all have noticed a pretty dramatic change in hair styles there but the message should be pretty clear, the caller needs to be put at ease, welcomed and be made to feel that there is going to be some one on the other end of the line who will take his or her concern seriously. The listener greets the caller, names the organization she represents, identifies herself and then puts the ball back into the callers court with the phrase such as how can I help and pauses and waits for a moment for the caller to engage. 

00:15:35
NORMA JAMES Now look at this. 

00:15:40
Hello. 

00:15:45
Is that the helpline? 

00:15:45
NORMA JAMES You see the difference? Here the caller felt rushed, wrong footed in someway and they won’t even be sure that they’ve got the right number. 

00:16:00
Listening 

00:16:05
MIKE SIMMONS Once our caller starts to tell their story then we need to listen to them. It goes without saying the telephone helpers must be pretty good listeners and if we’re going to be really effective helpers then we need to develop an even deeper level of listening than we would in face to face work. What we hear is all we’ve got to go on, because we can’t see the caller, we can’t pick up on any clues from their body language, everything we learn about them and their world will come from what they say and the way in which they say it. The tone or pitch of their voice, the speed at which they are talking, the spaces in between their words, the way the caller is breathing and even the surrounding sounds are worthy of our attention. Obviously it’s not easy. 

00:16:55
NORMA JAMES In any call the caller might be speaking too quietly or be shouting, be crying, be confused either about the problem or whether they’ve made contact with the right agency. They might have a speech impediment, have an accent or dialect, use colloquialisms, that we might have difficulty and understanding and on top of that there might be interference on the telephone itself. This is going to demand a very high levels of concentration have a listen to this, how easy is it to work and what’s going on? 

00:17:35
Ah… I don’t know whether you are going to help me probably not really, I mean ah… I don’t know it’s so difficulty to know what to say, where to begin? 

00:17:50
…certainly got enough to take and maintain. 

00:17:50
I don’t know, I don’t know whether I should believe you or not I mean, did you just might be hold this stuff up was it, already going to happen, I just can’t say if any one can help and yet here I am talking to you and I don’t know what you can do, I don’t know, (inaudible ) talk really I suppose I mean, I mean there must be other people who need to talk to you we’d all feel (inaudible ) really. What do you think? 

00:18:25
MIKE SIMMONS Another role play of course but it makes the point our callers seldom going to be that articulate when they first come to describe why they’ve made the call. This clearly underlines the importance of the right kind of working environment, we’ll be coming back to this a little later but it’s obvious that if we’re going to have to concentrate at this kind of level then we need to be quite sure that we’ll be free from interruptions and distractions of any sort. 

00:19:00
Keeping in Contact 

00:19:05
NORMA JAMES Listening isn’t enough on it’s own door, callers need to know that the person on the other end of the phone is actually listening to them and this leads us to rather paradoxical situation whereby listening on the telephone requires us to talk a lot more than would be expected in face to face communication. When people usually communicate with each other they often use what are called minimal encouragers the odd moment um… or nod of head, the shift of a body and so on. The same thing happens when two people are talking on the phone but the only kind of minimal encourages that the other person is actually going to aware are the audible ones. 

00:19:55
MIKE SIMMONS The telephone helper might know that he or she is listening attentively to the caller but unless that’s made clear they may well not be aware of being listened to. Therefore it’s essential that in one way or another call as reminded that the helper is still on the phone and listening carefully to what’s being said, that they’re keeping in contact. Audible minimal encourages and phrases such as hmm… yes… uh…huh… okay… can you explain that further… and so on are lightly to be used quite often, more often generally then will be the case in face to face conversation. When caller speaker at length it is even more important for the helper to show that they are listening, that they are still there, notice Norma’s use of minimal encourages here. 

00:20:50
…my relationship… 

00:20:50
NORMA JAMES Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:50
now I don’t know why is that goes wrong 

00:20:50
NORMA JAMES Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:55
And I really thought this was the one, you know… 

00:20:55
NORMA JAMES Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:55
…I really loved him… 

00:21:00
NORMA JAMES It might have been more helpful for me to have varied my responses a little but I am still actively showing that I am listening, it doesn’t end there of course, the caller needs more than to be listened to, they need to be understood and to feel understood and a first step to that comes in the responses we make. 

00:21:25
Responding 

00:21:30
MIKE SIMMONS We don’t just listen, we show that we’re listening, as you well already know from your previous training the most typical way in which we do this is by what are called paraphrases and reflections. Paraphrasing shows that we’ve understood the key issues and facts of the caller’s problems and concerns, reflecting shows that we understand what they feel about those facts, here are few more clips from that role play. 

00:22:00
…may be, may be (inaudible ) because I got over it. May be I haven’t got over it. 

00:22:10
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:22:10
I want him so much you know… 

00:22:10
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:22:10
…because it feels so pathetic you know it’s like I have spent whole of my life being miserable about men you know… 

00:22:20
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:22:20
And… and I end up feeling of failure um… I can’t bear that. 

00:22:25
NORMA JAMES And you thought you’d got past that and… 

00:22:30
Yeah. 

00:22:30
NORMA JAMES …fear you’re back again. 

00:22:30
I though I’ve made the right choice this time… 

00:22:35
NORMA JAMES Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:35
NORMA JAMES You know and it was going to work… 

00:22:35
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:22:40
Which doesn’t makes me feel like I always used to feel when I was kid. 

00:22:45
NORMA JAMES Hmm…Hmm… so it really made you feel quite helpless as well? 

00:22:50
Hmm… As if I’m never gonna succeed. You know I know I can succeed all sorts of things you know… 

00:22:55
NORMA JAMES Hmm… Hmm… hmm…… Yeah. 

00:22:55
…and I’ve done quite well in my career and I did well in my education but it’s like with, with relationships that’s where I always seem to screw it up. 

00:23:10
NORMA JAMES That’s the bit that really makes the difference it’s the relationship, that’s the bit that screws everything up for you… 

00:23:15
Hmm… 

00:23:15
NORMA JAMES No matter how successful and how hard you worked to get away somewhere along the line you back in that bit about human relationships How does that sound does that making sense of it? 

00:23:30
Hmm…Hmm… and I just feel so weak, I just hate feeling weak. 

00:23:40
NORMA JAMES You hate this feeling of weakness what you want just to be strong and looking after your family and coping and carrying on. 

00:23:50
Hmm… not needing(ph)… 

00:23:50
MIKE SIMMONS In those clips you saw Norma responding to what her caller was saying, but here is another one where you’ll see her responding to the way in which you where saying it. 

00:24:05
…well you know he got fed up with me and it just kind of makes me feel like I am not going to… I am not going to ever be happy with anybody. 

00:24:15
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:24:15
I am always going to be my own lonely in that case. 

00:24:20
NORMA JAMES I’m just sound quite sad when you’re telling me about Jim, this is the guy that you really thought you could make it with. 

00:24:30
MIKE SIMMONS So picking up on how something is being said can be just as important as the actual content often a good deal more important. 

00:24:40
NORMA JAMES Once the caller feels understood by their listener they are more likely to be able to explore their problem more deeply, a telephone counselor wanting to understand the underlying problems of the caller might well make more use of paraphrasing and reflecting and some one will kick on that information helpline, but it either case, they serve the function of showing the caller that we’re understanding what it is they’re saying and what they feel about it. 

00:25:10
Summarising 

00:25:20
MIKE SIMMONS A summary of course has elements of both reflection and paraphrase to it. It’s a more general outline of what’s been said so far. This is what you’ve been talking about, this is where we’ve got to, this is the core of what I understand you to be saying. Summarizing can be used at any time during the call but it’s particularly useful after caller has been speaking for a long while, or if a lot of material has been discussed we’re trying to make sure that we’ve really got a grasp of it. A typical phrase that you might use in these circumstances could be something like ah… it’s really important that I understand what has made this problem so difficult for you ah… can I just go back on what I’ve heard you say. Have a look at this it’s from the role play of a counseling session. It should give you a good idea of what a summary might look like. 

00:26:15
Right, okay, so it sounds as if you’ve moved to the area recently and that’s you and your husband made this decision to move it’s a joint decision, where you have some reservations and some doubts since you have been here and along with that your children have as well and this is proving very difficult for you as a, as a family unit, is that right so far? 

00:26:45
NORMA JAMES A summary also demonstrates that the caller, that the listener is keeping in contact, it can also be a good way of ending a call since it ensure that all the loose ends are drawn together and shows the caller that they’ve really been hurt. This is particularly important in telephone work since compared to face to face work there is always a greater chance of misunderstanding. 

00:27:10
MIKE SIMMONS Remember a summary is not a comprehension test, it simply means of ensuring that you’ve understood the core of what has been said and that your caller knows that you’ve understood. It should sound natural and certainly not be a list of everything that the caller had said so far like every skill it should only be used when it feels necessary to user. 

00:27:35
NORMA JAMES So to summarize. Summary show the caller that we’ve been listening to them that we’ve understood the core of what they’ve been saying that we understand the story of what they feel about that story and they also allow us to confirm for ourselves that we have got a grasp of what they’ve been talking about. 

00:28:00
Clarifying 

00:28:05
MIKE SIMMONS As we already said when people choose to ask for help of some kind they’re likely to be feeling anxious and confused, though they might be thinking about the issues that concern them constantly they’re unlikely to be how to present them in a very coherent manner. They might jump into their story half way through they might dart about from point to point, they’ll almost certainly assume that we’ve got a clear grasp of what’s going on than we really have. It’s important for us not to make the same assumption we have to untangle what they’re saying so that it’s clear to us and for them. Simply by reflecting and paraphrasing we can start this process, but this is also the time that we might find ourselves asking a few open questions the kind that begin with who, what, in what way, when, where, how. Sometimes just a single word will do, have a look at this. 

00:29:10
May be she is right. 

00:29:15
NORMA JAMES She? 

00:29:15
My doctor, may be umm.. may be she is right, may be… 

00:29:25
NORMA JAMES (inaudible [00:29:26) 

00:29:25
Hmm… not meeting him… 

00:29:30
NORMA JAMES Hmm… not meeting Jim? 

00:29:35
Hmm… yeah not meeting Jim. 

00:29:40
NORMA JAMES We have to work towards the clear understanding of our callers problem because without this understanding it’s very unlikely that we will be able to help. The telephone counselor will be doing this so that they understand where the focus of the work will be. The helpline operator will be doing it so that they know what kind of information to provide or where to refer the caller for more specific help but in either case if we’re not sure what the callers concerns really are then we’re unlikely to be able to help them. 

00:30:20
Silences 

00:30:25
MIKE SIMMONS We’ve talked about listening about showing that we’re listening and about helping our callers clarify their problems but all these assumes that they will find it easy to talk and this isn’t necessarily so. Some callers will find it very difficult to talk freely and they will lapse into silence some won’t even know where to start. 

00:30:50
NORMA JAMES Callers might be silent because they’re upset or because they need to think the difficult situation through, silences can last for varying lengths of time and can occur at any time during the call. 

00:31:05
MIKE SIMMONS Silence isn’t an exact term of course, what silence means in this context is that the caller and helper are not at that moment talking to each other. The silence may actually full of sounds, we may be able to hear the caller breathing or sighing perhaps or even crying. In face to face work silence is less of a problem because both parties can see each other, but over the telephone we have to work a little harder. 

00:31:35
NORMA JAMES How we respond to the silences, we play an important part in helping the caller to feel supported. They may well be wondering how we feeling about them not talking whether we feel that they’re wasting our time for example and they may also wonder whether we still there for them listening and involved. They need to be reassured to know that we accept the way that they’re using this time but we also need to be able to interpret the silence to ensure that it is productive that the caller isn’t simply waiting for us to say something. Once again it’s a challenging business, all the more so since silence can feel quite uncomfortable for us too. 

00:32:20
How do we feel when a caller is silent? How do we view silence? How do we recognize unproductive silences? 

00:32:20
MIKE SIMMONS How we respond to a particular silence is likely to depend on how we feel about silences in general. And there are number of questions we need to ask ourselves about this. How do we feel, think and behave when some one is silent? How do we view silence with respect or as a nuisance? How do we recognize unproductive silences and how do we respond to them? If we find them difficult then this is clearly something to work on. You might want to pull us for a moment to consider these points, but whether you do so now or later on it’s wisely important that you should reflect on these questions, because how you respond to them will affect how you respond to your silent caller. 

00:33:15
NORMA JAMES During silences with callers we also need to be asking ourselves some questions, is the caller still there and why are they silent, how were they feeling and what are they trying to say to us, what are the noises that I can hear and what are those noises mean? 

00:33:35
MIKE SIMMONS Ah… we also need to be showing that we’re still there. As we’ve already seen helpers usually demonstrate that they’re in active contact with their callers by the use of minimal encourages. But during silences particularly lengthy silences something more can be called for. Here is some of the things that help us mind say in these circumstances. 

00:34:00
I really want to hear what you have to say but it’s okay if you just want to be quiet. 

00:34:05
Can you talk the phone if you still want me to stay here. 

00:34:10
Take your time. 

00:34:15
I can hear you crying. 

00:34:15
That was a deep sign. 

00:34:20
I am still here I am listening to you, are you still there? 

00:34:25
MIKE SIMMONS In each case the helper is telling the caller that they’re still there for them and still listening and that’s what they need to know. 

00:34:40
Offering Information 

00:34:45
NORMA JAMES Once the caller has been able to say what they need to say or we’ve understood them and shown that we’ve understood them then we need to know what to do about it. Sometimes callers ring in to ask for specific information and we need to know how to access that information, some agencies keep it stored on a computer as those in hard copy and files. But why we’re looking for it the caller is going to need to know what’s going on. Remember in the same way that you can’t see them, they can’t see you, you may know that you’re sorting through notes, writing down phone numbers, pulling out leaflets or whatever but they don’t and they likely to feel quite perturbed because all of the sudden no one is talking to them. It’s important then to tell them what you’re going to do before you do it. Have a look at this. 

00:35:45
HELEN Hmm…Hmm… hmm… okay um… I think we’ve got some information that would be useful for you but it will take me couple of minutes to pull it all together I am going to put the phone down now while I go thorough our files so the line will go silent but I’ll be back okay. 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:10
MIKE SIMMONS Sometimes the information you provide will be the phone number of some other person you feel is better able or qualified to help. This can sometimes be difficult for your caller because he or she will already have made quite an effort to phone you and they now feel that they’re being fobbed off in some way, you may be quite sure that a referral is in the very best interest of your caller but it’s still important that you handle this carefully. 

00:36:40
HELEN Hmm… hmm… ah… I am aware it took a lot of courage for you to make this phone call and I am really glad you did but having explained what it’s about I am now realizing who it is you need to get help from. I know I realize that, but the most important thing is you get the right help from the right person, sure, let, let me explain something about who this person is. 

00:37:10
NORMA JAMES This probably seems pretty obvious but whether you’re referring some one on or giving them a piece of information it’s vital that your facts are up to date. Giving some one out of date telephone numbers, referring a caller to some one who is no longer in practice, giving an address for an agency that moved two years ago is simply poor practice and you can’t rely on other agency to tell you that they’ve moved, changed their phone number or whatever, they may do but you can’t be sure. So it’s going to be some ones job to go through the files on a regular basis and they make phone calls or write letters to ensure that the information you hold is up to date. That way you can give your callers a service they need. 

00:38:05
Note Taking 

00:38:15
MIKE SIMMONS Some telephone helpers write notes to help them to remember what’s been said some of them do this after the call, some of them do it as the call progresses, this can be useful but if your notes are too copious you’re likely to lose concentration and can end up giving more attention to your notes than to your caller, a few key words here and there are probably all that are needed. 

00:38:40
NORMA JAMES There are something else to bear in mind, even though your callers won’t be able to see you, they will often be able to hear you’re taking notes, if you do that during the session they’re already feeling I just don’t forget and this is only likely to make them more so, particularly about confidentiality 

00:39:00
MIKE SIMMONS Have a look at this clip and see how the very thought of something being written down immediately heightens the callers anxieties. 

00:39:10
NORMA JAMES I wonder you’ve heard my name and I’ll say it again it’s Norma, I wonder what it be possible for you to get me your name, your first name, name that you’re, you’re know, by how, how would you feel about telling me your first name. 

00:39:25
MARY Oh what you’re going to do with it? 

00:39:25
NORMA JAMES What I am going to do with it is perhaps talk with you better it will help me just to relate you a bit more… 

00:39:30
MARY Hmm… you’re not going to write it down or. 

00:39:35
NORMA JAMES I might just write it, I’ve got a sheet of paper here um… do you might afford me sort of putting a few things down and that helps me to um… to listen to you better… 

00:39:45
MARY See I don’t want anybody to know that I am phoning. I don’t want anybody to know about these, because I feel a sort of ashamed you know phoning to ask for help, any way it’s Mary, my name is Mary. 

00:40:00
NORMA JAMES Hello Mary. 

00:40:00
MIKE SIMMONS The caller always needs to know what’s going on. So, if you choose to keep notes, and it maybe that your agency requires you to do so, then this needs to be explained to the caller. And, in addition, they need to be sure that those notes are kept somewhere secure, and they need to know who has access to it. And this means that there must be a clear policy in place. This is not something that could be made up as go along. 

00:40:30
Ending the Call 

00:40:40
NORMA JAMES As we’ve already said, some callers may choose to end a call before the helper expects them to. The helper can sometimes respond to this with feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy, but it’s important to be aware that from the caller’s perspective, having and exercising this level of control can be hugely important. It might be the only control that they feel they can exercise. In fact, it can sometimes be worth a helper pointing out to the caller that they actually have this kind of control. They don’t have to stay on the line any longer than they wish to. 

00:41:20
MIKE SIMMONS Most calls don’t end suddenly, however. And the length of time a caller stays on the line would depend on the nature of the call, what is required and quite often the policy of the agency for which the telephone helper works. 

00:41:30
NORMA JAMES Some agencies such as Samaritans(ph) have an open policy when it comes to the length of session, and will stay on the line with the caller for as long as it required. Some telephone counselors set a limit of about an hour. Other agencies tend to offer about 15 minutes. Whatever time is being offered though, it’s always helpful to warn the caller when the call is coming to an end. Perhaps saying something like, am just reminding you that we’ve got about five minutes left, before I’ll have to end this call. 

00:42:10
MIKE SIMMONS Informing the caller of the time limits, at the start of the session also helps to make for an effective ending. Ending a call abruptly without giving the caller a warning of some kind may well feel quite rejecting to them. If there isn’t a time restriction, then we need to acknowledge this, otherwise the caller can start to become anxious about using up too much of our time and end the call before they’re really ready to do so. 

00:42:40
NORMA JAMES So, there’s a lot to do when you’re working as a telephone helper. The code of what we’ve been covering so far are simply being good communication. But communication with a clear focus, you want to help your caller to say what they need to say, so that you can give them the information, the advice or the counseling that they need. 

00:43:00
Putting it all together 

00:43:15
MIKE SIMMONS You’ve seen a number of excepts from a video Norma made for this program. Now, let’s look at a longest segment and see how over a comparatively short time a client can be helped to feel better about their situation. 

00:43:30
MARY Well, what I didn’t know is that whenever I think about him, I find myself crying. 

00:43:40
NORMA JAMES Like you’re crying now. And that sounds really painful Mary. 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:50
MARY And then I feel as a bit fooled. Actually I want to be a strong women, you know I want to be fine about being on my own a single parent could be with a job and a family and not needing a man. 

00:44:10
NORMA JAMES Hm… And that’s… 

00:44:10
MARY But then there’s you know… and I just feel so weak. I just hate feeling weak. 

00:44:20
NORMA JAMES You hate this feeling of weakness, what you want is to be strong and looking after your family and coping and carrying on. 

00:44:30
MARY Um… Not needing a man. 

00:44:30
NORMA JAMES Hmm… Not needing Jim? 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:40
MARY Yeah. Not needing Jim. 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:50
NORMA JAMES Your voice felt very, very quieter Mary. 

00:44:55
MARY Hmm…Hmm… Well, maybe… maybe she is right. 

00:45:10
NORMA JAMES She? 

00:45:10
MARY My doctor. Maybe… may be she is right, maybe it a stress, maybe it is I didn’t know boils loss. 

00:45:25
NORMA JAMES You have… 

00:45:30
MARY Somebody said to me, you’re suffering from loss. 

00:45:30
NORMA JAMES Hmm…Hmm… On what sense does that make to you when somebody said to you… 

00:45:35
MARY Then I felt pissed off with her when she said it because… 

00:45:40
NORMA JAMES Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:40
MARY you know… because I’m… I’m getting on with it. 

00:45:45
NORMA JAMES Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:45
MARY In it. 

00:45:50
NORMA JAMES And if I could give you some information here just… just very briefly about loss. And… and it’s the nature of loss that it can… you can dip in and out of it Mary. Um… Some days you could be feeling well, and I’m coping and I’m getting on with it, and then other days perhaps you hear um… a piece of music or it’s an anniversary or it’s the time of your… and there’s a man Maria and all of a sudden, you’re back in that loss again and it feels just as bad, just as bleak, just as horrible. And I wonder, if that’s something like, it almost feels like that’s something that you… you… you’ve told me about. A part of time, you’re okay. 

00:46:40
MARY Hmm… 

00:46:40
NORMA JAMES Other times, you’re back there again… 

00:46:40
MARY Hmm… Hmm… So, you’re saying that’s normal. 

00:46:45
NORMA JAMES Yes, I am. Yes, I am. And… and normal for what has happened to you. You’ve lost Jim and it isn’t just Jim that you’ve lost, you’ve also lost two other relationships. 

00:46:55
MARY Hmm… And all my hopes. 

00:47:00
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:47:00
MARY Hmm…Hmm…? 

00:47:00
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:47:00
MARY Hmm… 

00:47:05
NORMA JAMES And I guess perhaps that might be the hardest thing of all because hopes about the future. 

00:47:10
MARY Hmm… Hmm… 

00:47:10
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:47:10
MARY That make sense what you said. And it does like sense because it’s like that… it’s like I… 

00:47:20
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:47:20
MARY You know… because when I… when a friend rings me up and starts telling me about her latest relationship, but when I’m at work and I’m so… organizing a training event or whatever… 

00:47:30
NORMA JAMES Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:30
MARY Um… I’m fine. I’m fine (inaudible ) full of energy and things. 

00:47:40
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:47:40
MARY And then, you know like I can… you know it could just on the way home you know I hear it… that music on the radio or something and I’m suddenly finding myself with tears streaming down my face and I’m thinking it goes half an ago you know I was sort of being really kind of dynamic and being a confident and here I’m (inaudible ) like a little kid. 

00:48:05
NORMA JAMES And it sounds as topsy-turvy to use that. 

00:48:05
MARYA Topsy-turvy yeah. 

00:48:10
NORMA JAMES Yeah. yeah. 

00:48:15
Making a Contract 

00:48:20
MIKE SIMMONS There’s one other thing to consider though. When a client visits a counselor for the first time, the counselor will discuss with the client those things which will help to structure the counseling relationship, and which will provide a suitably safe and ethical environment in which to work. This might includes such things as length and number of sessions, availability, confidentiality, privacy, payment and so on. This is often referred to as a counseling contract. Is it clear from another role play of counseling practice, showing a contract being made. 

00:49:00
Okay. I know we… we touched on some of these things in our initial phone call, but it just feels important before we begin that we… we just sort of checkout a few bits and pieces to make sure you feel reasonably happy with it. The thing is it’s about confidentiality because I… you know I want you to be aware of how I’m going to treat any information you may choose to share with me. And I work with a high-level of confidentiality, I’m… I’m not going to be discussing on what you… Or is an important exception that you need to know about and which hopefully, you’ll find reassuring because the counselors um… standardly have supervision they go to somebody who they discuss their work with. And that’s really to make sure that their practicing ethically and competently. So it’s… as there is a, a safeguard for you. So, I might talk about to you along with a, a range of other clients. On a weekly basis, that’s what I think we discussed on the phone. 

00:49:55
Yeah. 

00:50:00
Um… So normally, what I try and do is find a mutual time that suits you and suits me and offer you the same time every week. So, the other thing is I think we touch based on the phone on… on the fees and I… I mentioned what my… 

00:50:15
You’re reasonably happy with that. 

00:50:15
Okay. A funny thing to raise, but of course, you know outside of this room, you’ll go and walk about the streets and so rely and I just wanted to… to sort of checkout with you, how you would like me to respond, if you be… 

00:50:30
NORMA JAMES A telephone counselor will make a very similar contract, just starting a few extra details. Who will call who, for instance, and what action the counselor should take if the caller hangs up mid call. Most helpline agencies on the other hand will make more informal arrangements, which might include little more than information about confidentiality and how much time the agency offers to callers. Some helplines offer no contract whatsoever, though that’s not something we would recommend. There’s no necessity to use the word contract when you’re talking to your callers of course. What matters is that there is an understanding between you of what’s on offer and what the limitations are to what’s on offer. 

00:51:20
MIKE SIMMONS Introducing the subject can at times be problematic, particularly if the caller is already upset when the make the call. Though the contract is important, there are times when actually discussing such practical issues can seem highly abusive. Your caller just has to tell their story and you’ve to listen. More than one helper has found themselves well into a session before they realize that they’ve now had the chance to explain the arrangements. Often this is appropriate and meets the callers immediate needs, but sooner or later they will need to know what you both embarking on. 

00:52:00
NORMA JAMES This is a problematic issue. Some agencies deal with it by playing a recorded message giving this kind of information before the phone call is put through. In some ways, this is quite unique solution. But I wonder how much attention an anxious client will pay to such a message when they’re desperately waiting for someone to listen to their story. 

00:52:25
MIKE SIMMONS Here’s Norma, negotiating the time contract with her client. As you can see, it’s a pretty open contract, but it still needed to be made. 

00:52:35
What I can’t do is give you my time and just be here to listen to whatever you want to say to me. Um… And we (inaudible ) together, if that would be of any help, um… 

00:52:50
Ah… Well, it seems like quite a long time. I didn’t know if I can talk about myself that long. Anyway, I’ve got to go and fetch my kids from school in about half an hour. 

00:53:00
Well that would be fine for… for you use the service for as long as you need it. 

00:53:05
MIKE SIMMONS A key component to any contract is likely to be confidentiality. And it’s something that many callers make assumptions about. They’ll sometimes be frightened that you’re automatically tell other people what they’ve told you or alternatively, assume that whatever they say will be held in the strictest of confidences. As always, you need to clarify the assumptions they make and be clear about what’s actually on offer. 

00:53:35
NORMA JAMES Some agencies offer an almost completely confidential service. Others will break confidentiality, if there’s a risk of harm to others and/or to the caller. If the agency you work for is prepared to hold confidentiality about self-harm, for instance, then it’s important that you should agree with it’s policy. This is particularly so in situations where helpers take a call from someone who is suicidal. This is challenging work for anybody, but if you’re not comfortable with keeping that kind of confidentiality, then you need to be thinking seriously about whether you should be doing this kind of work. 

00:54:20
MIKE SIMMONS From a legal perspective though it’s worth remembering that there are issues which any citizen has a duty to report. Terrorism is one example, but there are others. A further point to consider though is that some agencies require statistics to be kept about their callers. If that’s the case for your agency, then the caller needs to be told about this; including what sort of information is being kept, and again, who has access to it and where that information is stored. 

00:54:50
NORMA JAMES So far, we’ve looking at what you actually need to be doing when you’re offering help to somebody over the phone. There are some other more general points though, which also need considering. 

00:55:05
Listen to your own voice 

00:55:15
NORMA JAMES The most important tool we have is telephone helpers is our voice. And we need to pay particular attention to how our voice represents us on the phone. Our callers will deduce a lot from how we’re saying to them. Some of what they deduce will be simple assumptions, of course, but they will also be able to pick up whether we are happy to be speaking to them, whether we’re bored or judgmental, annoyed or frustrated, if we’re really interested in what they have to say or if we just playing tired. 

00:55:50
MIKE SIMMONS I wonder what sort of voice you have. It’s important that you know the answer to this, and the only way you’re going to find out is by listening. The easiest ways to do this is to record your voice. Listen to it and get some feedback. 

00:56:00
Hello, um… this is the community mental health helpline. Um… Can I help you in anyway? And what… what’s the problem? Ha…ha…ha… 

00:56:20
MIKE SIMMONS Those people when they hear their recorded voice for the first time say that’s not how I sound. And that’s the truth, but only for them because they hear their voice through vibrations in their skull. It is how they sound to everybody else. Another response is don’t I sound all for and that’s worth checking out too. So, record your voice, get someone else to listen to it to confirm that that’s how you sound, and then think about how people will hear you. The things you might become more aware of a pitch, tone, clarity, accent and pace. 

00:57:05
[sil.] 

00:57:25
NORMA JAMES It’s not a matter of losing your accent or trying to be someone you’re not. But it’s inevitable that the people who hear you talking over the phone will draw conclusion from what they hear. So it’s important that you try to get some sort of idea of what those conclusions might be. You might not be presenting yourself quite as you’d like to, but you won’t know that unless you listen to yourself. You may not be able to do too much about how you sound, but it’s vitally important that you recognize how you sound to other people. And that you do your best to communicate clearly in a way that other people can relate to. 

00:58:05
MIKE SIMMONS We’ve talked about your voice and how people might draw conclusions from that they hear. But the corollary of this is, is equally true. You’re likely to be drawing conclusions from your caller’s voice to. We’ll do this because it makes life easier for us. If we can put someone into a pigeonhole, then they become less unknown, more familiar and so, our world becomes more predictable. 

00:58:35
NORMA JAMES It’s important to be aware of doing this because the conclusions we draw from the voice can also often be wrong. Little more than judgments based on very limited information. Watch out for this. I’m just far as possible, trying to treat each caller as a unique person they actually are. 

00:58:55
Taking Difficult Calls 

00:59:05
Look, what is this all about? What is happening here, I rang you up because I was informed that it would be helpful um… you know to me to come and talk um… is that somebody um… you know particularly over the phone because it uh… it’s anonymous, isn’t it? But I’ve been really feeling upset and really hacked off about the problem that I’ve got and all I get from you is promptitude ums… and ahs… 

00:59:25
MIKE SIMMONS It’s not unusual for telephone helpers to be involved with difficult calls. As we’ve already seen, difficulties might arise when a caller stops talking to the helper and becomes silent for long periods of time. But callers can also sometimes, become angry abusive or threatening. Whatever the reason and it might well include the relative freedom that the telephone offers such calls can be very uncomfortable for the helper. And he or she needs to be prepared for and willing to engage with such calls. 

01:00:05
NORMA JAMES Callers will often have strong feelings. And sometimes those feelings will manifest themselves as anger. It’s comparatively rare for a caller to actually be angry with a helper, but it can often feel like they are. Generally, the anger is a response to the problem that the caller is confronted with. And it can usually be diffused through accurate listening, appropriate responding and a non-judgmental stands. Much easier said than done, of course. 

01:00:35
MIKE SIMMONS Sometimes the caller will become angry with us because they want us to be able to do more than we actually can. This can be particularly difficult to handle, if it hooks into our own beliefs about the importance over being a helper. If we want to help and can’t for some reason, then the callers anger can seem justified. It’s important not to buy into this because in some way doing so, actually disempowers the caller. We need to accept that they’re angry, but not to take responsibility for their anger. If we’re feeling defensive, we’re less likely to be able to help. 

01:01:20
NORMA JAMES But what about the caller who is deliberately abusive or threatening? If angry callers could be difficult to work with, then abusive callers can be even more so. 

01:01:30
MIKE SIMMONS Agencies and organizations who offer help over the phone are sometimes a victim of threatening or abusive calls. And then there is one kind of abusive call that can be particularly disturbing for helpers. I’m thinking here, so called sex calls. Sexual abuse comes in many guys and some people chose to abuse others over the telephone. The aim of people who abuse in this way is controlled and they achieve this through a game of manipulation, an entrapment, which quite often involves the listener with the caller before they even realize that they are being abused. This can happen, even though the listener might know that engaging with the caller is part of the game that they’re being pulled into. Once hooked so, it is difficult to get unhooked. 

01:02:20
NORMA JAMES As a result, listeners are likely to feel very disturbed, frightened, and vulnerable during and after the call. Despite the fact that they may well have received training around this very issue. It’s not unusual for this kind of call to resonate with the helper for sometime. If an agency expects it’s workers to engage with those making abusive or threatening calls, then adequate training, selection support and supervision for listeners must be provided. And if you work for such an agency, it’s important that you ensure that all this is in place. 

01:03:05
MIKE SIMMONS Agencies that expect their listeners to tolerate abusive calls are the exception however, and it’s widely recognized that telephone helpers have the right not to be abused in this way and that it’s appropriate to terminate such calls. It’s also important for helpers, then to have access to immediate support. Someone who they can phone up, perhaps to talking through with. 

01:03:30
NORMA JAMES If an agency doesn’t require it’s telephone helpers to listen to abusive or threatening calls, then again, training should be provided to prepare all it’s helpers to end calls in such a way, that it does not take away their dignity of safety, but which still has the callers needs firmly in sight. Many agencies provide their workers with a written statement which they can read to any abusive caller before terminating the call. 

01:04:00
Yeah. 

01:04:00
NORMA JAMES Let’s see how one agency might deal with this. 

01:04:05
Hmm… It’s my conclusion that you’re using this call to be abusive. As it’s our agencies policy not to let it’s listeners become the object of abuse, I now have no other option, but to end this call. Bye. 

01:04:20
[sil.] 

01:04:25
NORMA JAMES There is a difficultly in treating such calls in this way, however. In that, some callers will need to discuss problems of a sexual nature. And it takes a fair amount of experience and intuition to decide whether the caller is need in help or is being abusive. 

01:04:45
MIKE SIMMONS It’s not just abusive calls that can be problematical either. They can also be hoax calls, which are purely mischievous. The difficulty here is that we can never be quite sure whether the call is a hoax or someone in distress who is simply unable to express themselves. 

01:05:00
I’m really depressed. 

01:05:00
MIKE SIMMONS It all comes down to making a judgment all of course, but I know I rather sit listening to a dozen call from giggling teenagers than miss one from a genuine caller. 

01:05:10
Now you’re out of luck and I’m out of time 

01:05:15
I’m really depressed. 

01:05:15
MIKE SIMMONS This sounds a logical enough, but if an agency becomes known as being fair game, it could be that it’s phone lines get tide up so much with hoax calls, the genuine callers aren’t able to get through. 

01:05:30
NORMA JAMES Of course, we can’t always be sure that what appears to be quite obviously a hoax call, really is one. And not someone testing the service out in someway. When it comes down to it, there are simply no easy answers. 

01:05:45
MIKE SIMMONS And there are another easy answers when it comes to comes to taking calls from people who are suicidal either. These calls can also leave the listener feeling vulnerable. And again, it’s important that listeners who take such calls should have adequate training and support. It’s also important that they should become very aware of their personal beliefs, concerns and fears about suicide. Some agencies will not intervene with someone’s desire to end their life if they express a wish not to be helped. Other agencies will actively intervene to save a caller’s life whether they request help or not. Whatever stands the agency does take, the helper needs to agree with that stance. To be ambivalent about this, is unhelpful for both the listener and the caller. 

01:06:40
Working Conditions 

01:06:50
NORMA JAMES Not every telephone listener will be working in the same conditions, of course. Some people will be working at home, with a call routed to them from a central number. Others will visit an agency to take their shift. Some of them might be working at an empty building while others will be working with colleagues who are also helpers, or with those who are doing very different work. In each case, there are implications, which we need to be aware of. Some agencies will be offering help to people who could be very vulnerable and will need a high-level of listening, understanding and support. I’m thinking here of agencies such as Samaritans(ph) or Saneline(ph). This work is often very demanding on the listener, and in these circumstances, it is imperative that there’s a high-level of support in place for the listener and that they have access to appropriate types of supervision. 

01:07:50
MIKE SIMMONS Look at this clip. Notice the supervisor is there on the spot to offer assistance when it’s called for, or when someone seems to be struggling. This pit stop supervision will often let along side the individual and the group supervision that is provided by the agency. But you’ll also see that this could present very real difficulties for both caller and listener. Think about privacy. The possibility for interruptions and distractions and the frustration that this might cause for the people involved in the call.

NORMA JAMES Those who work from home, run a greater risk of being disturbed in the middle of a call. This could be a family member, a pet or a double-glazing salesmen. 

01:08:40
Hello. Anyone in the home? Hello, anyone in the home? 

01:08:45
Yeah. 

01:08:45
Hello, won’t you call back? Oops! Sorry. 

01:08:50
NORMA JAMES If there’s a dedicated line for helpline calls, then there’s even the risk of being disturbed by the home line. Again, most agencies offer those helpers who work onsite they use the headsets, which can be far less tiring to use than a conventional handset. But this facility is unlikely to be available to those working at home. There’s also much less in the way of support and many helpers working from home have reported a certain degree of resentment from family members who want their full attention known. 

01:09:25
MIKE SIMMONS Home-based telephone work can be particularly isolating and can lead to a listener feeling unsupported and easily exhausted. It might seem that working from home is much more convenient than working for an agency onsite, but in practice we can see that there are some very real disadvantages too.

Looking after Yourself 

01:09:55
NORMA JAMES The care of the helper is the responsibility of both that helper and the agency that he/she works for. Every helper will need training, both initial and ongoing and supervision appropriate to their needs. If you’re not getting sufficient support, then you should ask for it. To ensure good practice, all agency should also have a current set of policies and procedures to underpin all the work they do. In this case, both the caller and the helper are supported and protected by the agency. Make sure you know what your agency’s policies and procedures are. 

01:10:40
MIKE SIMMONS Giving undivided attention to someone over a period of time is very demanding, particularly so, if that call is from the person who is very distort. Those who work in situations where they don’t know how long the call will last or who will call or what that call will be about, will often find that this kind of helping is even more exhausting. 

01:11:05
NORMA JAMES Helpers need to recognize this and to use strategies, which will help them to manage their work more effectively. 

01:11:10
MIKE SIMMONS This might include getting up and walking around the room after every call. Doing breathing exercises or whatever, but it’s a recipe for disaster both for the caller and the helper to take one call after another without a break. 

01:11:30
NORMA JAMES And that’s it from us. This program is not a substitute for good training. But it is a starting point. We’ve looked at why people should use the telephone, what advantages it offers and what difficulties it presents? We’ve looked at the skills we need to use and the things we need to consider, and we’ve also looked at you in all of this. What you need to do next is consider what this means to you. What are you going to do and what you need to do if you are to be an effective telephone helper. 

01:12:05
MIKE SIMMONS Now, one thing to remember when you’re thinking about all this is that though the telephone has it’s limitations that doesn’t mean it has to limit the way in which you relate to other people. Bye-bye. 

01:12:15
NORMA JAMES Bye-bye.

The school of health and social sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers and students and that anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics of the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but lighthearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series in common with other material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. If you’re a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday look, we think that will have something to interest you. Call for brochure or visit our website and see what we’ve got to offer.
