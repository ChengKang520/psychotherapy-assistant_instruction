BODY & SOUL 

00:01:15
GAIL HARRIS No matter who you are or how healthy you may be you probably think your life could be better and you’re probably right. Hi I’m Gail Harris. Welcome to Body and Soul, the series devoted to helping you make your life better in everyway by connecting mind, body and spirit. Each week we offer you information on how to be healthier and happier starting now. With a doctor who practices a different kind of medicine sometimes described as integrative, holistic or complementary. What it means is combining the best of conventional western medicine with approaches that are often unconventional. 

00:01:55
Total Well-Being: Starting the Search 

00:02:00
GAIL HARRIS Dr. James Gordon is a Harvard Medical School graduate, a psychiatrist and clinical professor at the Georgetown University School of Medicine. He describes his work as new medicine, one that sees each patient as a whole person. We first heard of Dr. Gordon and his center for Mind-Body Medicine from the National Conference he hosts every year on alternative cancer treatments. He is also a frequent visitor to Bosnia and Kosovo where he counsels people traumatized by war. There are many patients who sing Dr. Gordon’s praises, some with dramatic stories to tell. 

00:02:30
MYRTLE KHAN This is just before you began to have the episode. 

00:02:35
CHRISTOPHER KHAN Yeah. 

00:02:35
GAIL HARRIS On the way home from a visit with friends ten years ago, Christopher, aged seven fell asleep in the car. Despite repeated attempts his mother was unable to wake him. 

00:02:45
MYRTLE KHAN I continued to shake him and I couldn’t get a response and we rushed him to the hospital. 

00:02:55
GAIL HARRIS Christopher was taken to several of the best hospitals in Washington, but conventional doctors had no answers, medication didn’t help either. His blackouts and seizures continued for months, $40,000 and medical bills later. A friend suggested that he see Dr. Gordon. 

00:03:10
JAMES S. GORDON , MD Director, Ctr. For Mind-Body Medicine It turned out just taking a simple history that he had been hit in the head with a ball couple of months before and he had been bothered some by headaches and then the seizures began. 

00:03:25
MYRTLE KHAN He took Christopher to his table, laid him out and felt his spine and obviously he was not happy with what he felt. 

00:03:35
JAMES S. GORDON And I felt his neck and clearly the vertebrae in the neck, the position of the vertebrae was shifted. 

00:03:45
MYRTLE KHAN Christopher’s mother He twisted his neck very suddenly and there was this pop. And as I heard the pop, Christopher at the same time rose from the table and he said; “I feel so good! This is a miracle!” 

00:04:00
CHRISTOPHER KHAN Patient of Dr. Gordon I just feel like a gush of warmth rushed into my head and I just felt so alive again and so invigorated with that, what he did that day. 

00:04:10
JAMES S. GORDON Basically that was it. I’ve known him 8 or 9 year since then he is fine. 

00:04:20
GAIL HARRIS I came to see what this new medicine could do for a healthy person. Right from the start, Dr. Gordon goes beyond the traditional medical history to inquire about his patients’ emotional lives. How do you feel about your work? Are your relationships good at home? Anything else going on that he should know about? Only then do you move on to physical issues like diet, exercise and posture. 

00:04:40
JAMES S. GORDON This is simple thing measured leg length. 

00:04:45
GAIL HARRIS Okay. 

00:04:45
JAMES S. GORDON And actually your legs are the same, you don’t have any back pain so there’s probably no significant lower back problem. What we’re doing is we’re feeling the vertebrae in the neck here. 

00:05:00
GAIL HARRIS Spinal adjustments are often used by chiropractors and osteopaths, Dr. Gordon has also had special training. 

00:05:05
JAMES S. GORDON Put your mind in your belly. That’s good. That’s it, perfect. You feel any warmer in your face? Little more blood coming to the face, because when the vertebrae are shifted it shuts down both on the nervous system but also on the blood supply to your head. 

00:05:20
GAIL HARRIS Then a surprise, remember how healthy I thought I was taking my pulse the Chinese way made us both think again. 

00:05:30
JAMES S. GORDON Kidney(ph) pulse is actually a little low. That means you’re still working too hard, hahaha… even now. 

00:05:40
GAIL HARRIS It’s been a rough path(ph). 

00:05:40
JAMES S. GORDON Yeah, well that shows. 

00:05:40
GAIL HARRIS Who knew a few weeks on the road could be so stressful. In fact stress reduction is a major part of a Dr. Gordon’s prescription for better health. If you don’t know how stressed you are or what’s causing it, biofeedback can help you find out. 

00:05:55
JAMES S. GORDON But they are very simple biofeedback devices and one of them ones that we use in, we use it particularly in places like Kosovo and Bosnia are these little biofeedback dots. And these dots measure temperature. So for example right now, you’re quite relaxed. Biofeedback is really just a beginning, because after a while you’ll become quite aware of how you are breathing or how your thoughts are affecting your biology. 

00:06:20
GAIL HARRIS Something else to consider for optimal health, how to remain flexible. Dr. Gordon recommended what he does, yoga. Again, not what I was expecting to hear from an MD. 

00:06:35
KRIS O’SHEE And this is the cat pose which is wonderful… 

00:06:35
JAMES S. GORDON In America there is so much emphasis on strength and aerobic conditioning. In some ways it’s important. But it’s probably not in the long run as important as flexibility. Because flexibility is going to be much more of a protection against injury than strength or even aerobic conditioning. The postures of yoga are wonderful to introduce into your program. 

00:07:00
KRIS O’SHEE Yoga Instructor And curl under just like a cat. 

00:07:05
JAMES S. GORDON The major thing about being in good health is celebrating and enjoying what you’re doing. Any kind of wellness plan in the long run depends upon you. I can get you started, but you are the one who has to keep it going. 

00:07:20
KRIS O’SHEE And exhale. It’s fun, isn’t it? 

00:07:25
GAIL HARRIS Yeah. 

00:07:30
Next… Help Yourself 

00:07:30
GAIL HARRIS And now a new segment on Body and Soul which we’re calling Help Yourself. Every week this is where you’ll find specific information on the topics we’ve been talking about. For example, right about now you may be wondering how you can find a holistic physician like Dr. Gordon for your primary care. Or perhaps you want a specialist in some form of alternative therapies. If you’re not sure who or what’s out there, where do you begin? How do you know who to trust? Number one, it’s a good idea to find a healthcare provider before you get set, so that you’ll be comfortable if or when you really need them. It is also important to work with your doctor or other practitioner to prevent problems, so that you can stay healthy. A good starting place is with the person’s credentials. Make a phone call before your first visit to ask about professional degrees, training, certification and licenses. For fields that aren’t licensed yet, look for healers who have put in years of apprenticeship with a master in the field. In your first meeting, notice whether the practitioner is dealing with you as a whole person, really listening to you and taking the time to get to know you. Are they willing to share the scientific evidence for the therapies they recommend? And are they willing to admit it when they don’t have an immediate answer? One other thing to look for, are you expected to be actively involved in your care? A good healthcare provider is also a good teacher, who helps you learn about behavior, lifestyle and diet and who also lives the healthy lifestyle they are recommending to you. In that first visit, you may want to draw up a personal wellness plan with your doctor, so that you’ll be able to do your part to stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible, which is what optimal healthcare, the Body and Soul way is all about. 

00:09:15
CHECK CREDENTIALS • degrees • training • certification • licenses NOTICE: • do they listen? • give evidence • admit if they don’t know? LOOK FOR: • are you involved? • do they teach you? • are they healthy? For more information: pbs.org Next… Thich Nhat Hanh 

00:09:25
[non-English song] 

00:09:35
GAIL HARRIS Thich Nhat Hanh is the Vietnamese monk and zen master nominated for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize by Dr. Martin Luther King. In dozens of books and hundreds of lectures, he teaches the importance of compassion for ourselves and others. We sat down with him at Plum Village, the Buddhist monastery he founded in France, to learn first of all how to breath. 

00:10:05
THICH NHAT HANH Zen Master You don’t have to do anything very special, you just become aware of the fact that you are breathing in, breathing in. I know I’m breathing in. And breathing out, I know I’m breathing out. And I enjoy my in breath, I enjoy my out breath. And suddenly I find that I’m truly alive, truly present. And this everyone can do. And it makes a big difference. Our true home is life, and life is in the present moment, in the here and the now, that is the address of true life. So mindful breathing can bring us back to our true home, true life. And we should be able to do it in our daily life. 

00:11:05
GAIL HARRIS Many of us spend our daily lives rushing from one event to another event to the next event. How can we take time during those busy days to do exactly what you suggest? 

00:11:15
THICH NHAT HANH When you drive your car, it is possible that you drive in mindfulness and enjoy every moment of your driving. When you are about to pickup the telephone, you can enjoy your in breath and out breath and thinking that you are going to establish a relationship with someone, even doing business, because you are, you are dealing with human beings. So before picking up the phone you may enjoy mindful breathing, smiling, for 10 seconds. You become fresh and calm and ready. And that is not, not only good for your, your business but good for you and good for the other person. And I think if everyone in the city does the same then the city would be in much more pleasant space to live in and that is what we call telephone meditation. So driving, telephoning, walking, gardening, cooking, we can do it as an act of meditation and all of us have to learn to do that in order to be able to cope with the pressure, the stress that is plaguing our time. It is very important. 

00:12:45
GAIL HARRIS You say that even washing dishes can be a pleasant experience? 

00:12:50
THICH NHAT HANH Sure! I have written a book that’s about washing dishes and the mindfulness of the, the miracle of mindfulness. If you take time to, to enjoy dishwashing and then dishwashing become a meditation. And if you are happy during the time of dishwashing and then when you sit down and enjoy your coffee and your tea you will be able to enjoy it truly. If you, you think of the time of washing is the time you, you lose. And then at the time of sitting down and drinking your tea or coffee you may be thinking of something else and you, and you will lose your coffee, you will lose your tea, you will lose yourself. It means you continue to lose your life. 

00:13:50
GAIL HARRIS Is that really what this is all about trying to find a way to make a happier life for yourself? 

00:13:55
THICH NHAT HANH Yes, the practice of meditation, the practice of mindfulness is the practice of happiness. And happiness is possible even if we think that there is a lot of difficulties, a lot of obstacles around us and inside of us, it is possible to, to make a breakthrough in order to experience happiness. And happiness like anything else should be able to grow hour by hour, minute by minute and day by day. It is like a flower. You need the ground. You need the seed. You need the, the water. You need the sunshine. You need the care in order for the flower to grow. Your happiness you’ve to plant it. You have to grow it. You cannot thus come without any training. Compassion is a kind of flower too and that flower can only bloom on the ground of understanding. If you really understand the difficulties, the suffering, the aspiration of the other person you would not be angry at him or her anymore. And that deep understanding will help compassion to be born in you and you know how to deal with him or her with compassion. And you should be able to deal with yourself in the same way. And that is the most beautiful thing you can do in our life, because that is the best contribution we can make to life. 

00:15:40
GAIL HARRIS You’ve written that it’s important to have the garbage heap as well as the flower that they, they go together. And many people looking back on the 20th century would say there was a 100 years of garbage heap. What flowers do you hope will bloom from that in the 21st century? 

00:16:00
THICH NHAT HANH I think during the 20th century we have suffered a lot. And we don’t want to, to have suffered for nothing. Something can, can be made, can be obtained from the suffering. And according the Buddha, if you know how to handle suffering, if you know how to look deeply into the suffering, the flower of understanding will arise. And with the flower of understanding we know the way. We know what to do and what not to do in order for the flower of happiness to be possible. We should ask everyone, parents, children, teachers, politicians, educators, filmmakers, everyone to devote time in order, in order to practice looking deeply into the nature of our suffering. And… And then out of that collective meditation, there will be the flower of understanding that will save us, that will point to us the direction to go for the 21st century. 

00:17:20
GAIL HARRIS Thank you very much. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:30
GAIL HARRIS Another way to feel as good as you possibly can everyday is to keep moving. Gabrielle Roth describes her five rhythm practice, the ecstatic dance she teaches in workshops all over the country as a way to sweat your prayers. And now let we see you know what she means and we can also understand why those who try it say it can change your life. 

00:17:50
JAY KAPLAN , MD Okay, yeah. I wear a lot of hats, and practicing emergency medicine and running an emergency department is, is very stressful. So the key thing for me is not to hold that stress in my body but rather to try to channel it in some kind of constructive way, move it through my body and out. 

00:18:10
GABRIELLE ROTH Hips, and let me see your finger if you’re moving. And that your knees to your feet. And bring all this into circular motion. 

00:18:35
GABRIELLE ROTH Author, Sweat Your Prayers Anybody could do the five rhythm practice. It’s designed to be accessible to absolutely anybody who wants to move. We are not only stretching the body, but we’re stretching the minds so that we become more intuitive, more imaginative and more inspired. If we don’t move then we’re stuck. We get stuck in the same old ideas and all feelings that are unexpressed. We’re in a body that doesn’t move and everybody needs to move. When Jay first started dancing with me I, I recall him walking across the dance floor and I said to him; “Whose back is that?” He was walking like an old man and he was in his late 20’s. And suddenly he realized that it was his father’s back, that he was carrying his father’s burden in his back. 

00:19:20
JAY KAPLAN I was very stiff, came to the work, got very excited about the, the way that the movement allowed me to connect both physical exercise and what was going on inside in my mind and what, what I was feeling in my heart. Through that, I had been able to be healthier now than I was when I was 28 years old. 

00:19:45
GABRIELLE ROTH Thousands and thousands of people heal themselves through the dance. Some people are healing their relationship to their body, other people are healing their relationship to their hearts, other people are healing their relationship to their minds. There is only one requirement and that’s that we each give ourselves the permission to be danced. They give our self the permission to experience whatever is really going on inside of us and to know that we have the power to transform that. The reason we get trapped in self-consciousness is because we’re paying attention to that little chattering mind that’s going; Oh I’m too farther(ph), I’m not good enough or I don’t have the right clothes on earth, I don’t know any steps or… And we listen to that. And, and… What I like to do is drown that voice out with the beat. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
GABRIELLE ROTH By doing the five rhythm practice we really are not only working out the body but the soul. Flowing is the first rhythm. It’s very rooted, it’s very circular, very earthy, very grounded. And in that space we really let the dance in. After we’ve experienced what’s going on, we use staccato to express it, to put it out there, to let the dance out. Staccato is a very percussive, passionate, fiery, angular, linear type of dance where the movements do have a beginning and an end. Chaos is art. Chaos is the nature of life itself. It's where you have, you come to your own edge and you jump off. It’s where the inhale and the exhale collide. 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:10
GABRIELLE ROTH Where the feminine and the masculine come together and of course that always creates chaos. Lyrical is the rhythm most connected to our souls. It’s the rhythm most connected to our individual pattern. So that it’s to me and the dance floor where the dancer really discovers their style. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:45
GABRIELLE ROTH In stillness we move into letting be, whatever is left, taking that and moving in it, moving more deeply into it. Whatever is left. 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:10
GABRIELLE ROTH So to get to know all the dimensions of our humanity, through the dance, to get to know ourselves as energy and in a field of energy. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:35
JAY KAPLAN If you’re open and this dance helps me open to myself and to other people then I can relate and connect to other people wherever they are. I don’t think there is any question that this dance makes me a better doctor. If I didn’t balance or practice for emergency medicine and administration of emergency medicine out with the dance, I don’t think that I would be as a good father or as a good husband as I am, because I think I would carry a lot of distress home with me. 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:15
JAY KAPLAN This dance allows me to let go of it. 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:25
AMBER KAPLAN The rhythms have become part of our daily life. And when we have issues, we just sometimes put on music and will dance, will dance it through. We all go through really difficult times and we can use this creative element of the dance to take a problem and turn it into art, that’s something that Gabrielle has taught me. 

00:24:55
JAY KAPLAN We have a pretty healthy family. I want them to stay that way and I think that dance can help that out. 

00:25:05
[sil.] 

00:25:15
GAIL HARRIS And may be your family laughs when you get up to dance, like mine does. But so what, they’re not living in your body, you are. Close the door if you feel self-conscious, crank up your favorite music and move. I promise you’ll feel great. And that’s it for this edition of Body and Soul. I’m Gail Harris, until next time be well.
