Ethical Principles Underpinning Counselling Best Practice by Stacey Lloyd 

00:00:00
TRAINING SKILLS CENTRE Ethical principles underpinning Counselling best practice Facilitated by Stacey Lloyd Clinical Psychotherapist, Speaker, educator 

00:00:20
STACEY LLOYD I'm Stacey Lloyd and welcome to Ethical principles underpinning counselling best practice. I am a family and child psychotherapist in private practice and have an academic interest in all things ethics and supervision. So what I'd thought we do today is run through some of the theories that sit behind ethics, mostly to do with the practical application for counselors as opposed to psychology. And as you've got questions feel free to ask them of me. Go get the microphone. 

00:00:55
[sil.] 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN Is that on? Hello? I hear this phrase best practice bandied around everywhere. And I know-, and I might be just live in a small town and not get out much. But what the hell does it mean? 

00:01:15
STACEY LLOYD That's a good question. Good question. And for me it's something that is very-. We couldn't have planned that better. It's something that is actually so big and so all-encompassing that it means something different to everybody else. So for me best practice and what we'll be sort of heading toward today in this particular workshop/lecture is trying to work out what best practice means to you. So for me best practice is about being able to be a good practitioner. Be able to be a good supervisor, have great supervision. Be able to be someone who works to an ethical code of practice. Someone that actually goes above and beyond just being able to recite an ethical code or recite a textbook. For me it's that richness, that tapestry that we have inside us, not just as therapists. It's more than the work. So it's something that constantly evolves over a period of time. If we're talking about developmental theory, best practice is something that is a bit like Maslow's hierarchy. Where you're sort of always trying to get to it but we never quite reach that level of self-actualization. So with respect to counseling and the counseling industry and profession, I guess best practice is clearly undefined at this point in time as we're trying to evolve and regulate and while we're still being self-regulated. So that's why it's always good for people to actually tell me as well what best practice actually means to you. So do you have any thoughts about-. Is that okay? 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:02:45
STACEY LLOYD May as well start it now. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Well, it's just-. I always looked at it and projected onto it there's this team of people somewhere who've decided what best practice is. And one day they're going to tell me what that is or I mean to know, even though I've never actually found anyone. And it just seems to be showboating that is, oh we are best practice NGO or blah, blah, blah. So I'm consoled by this notion that well, it's a work in progress and you try to be the best that you can be. The only thing is, in terms of how it actually ends up being perceived and whatever, it's like, it almost feels like false advertising on a certain level. 

00:03:35
Introduction ethics are a standard set by a profession of which a practitioner is obliged to commit in order to do no harm to clients; ethics are defined by a counsellors own values, beliefs, prejudices, attitudes, biases which in turn allow us to create appropriate boundaries; which can create boundary issues and conflicts, ambiguity and ethical dilemmas. 

00:03:35
ETHICS IS ABOUT ENCOURAGING THINKING ABOVE THE DILEMMA ITSELF 

00:03:35
Unethical behaviour/conduct can: cause harm undermines the willingness of clients to seek professional help can have legal ramifications i.e. malpractice, libel, slander can have ethical ramifications i.e. ethics investigation lead to harm to the client 

00:03:35
STACEY LLOYD Yeah, because of it being undefined. And I guess that's the thing with counseling in general and why this whole topic, not just the best practice but ethics. I mean, people presume ethics is the black and white of a profession. For me, ethics is the shades of gray. It's all those dilemmas. It's all those unspeakables. It's all those things you take to supervision but you're too afraid to talk about, because it might be unethical. So, you're right. Best practice is about an evolutionary process. It also, I guess, in counseling is relatively, in my world, undefined because we haven't quite got to that point where we have to actually define it definitively. So like he said, best practice NGO. And hopefully we won't have to. You know, I think that's what makes counseling great, the fact that we have all these different ideas and different people and therapies and things. We're not mandated. We're not mandated to actually have to do anything, particularly when it comes to prescribing or being prescribed a best practice model. So it will be interesting to carry on with that theme actually throughout the talk. I'll add it in now that's it's been raised up and weave it in. But it is definitely a richness. It's something we all bring collectively to the profession. Okay. So what do we know about ethics? We know that there are standards set by a professional organization of which us as practitioners, student counselors, whoever, are obliged to commit in order to do no harm to clients. I'll provide all these handouts at the end if you want to. Yeah? I've got my email address, so I should have said that. I was too busy thinking about the microphone. So, they are a standard, they're a document. They're defined by a counsellors own values, beliefs, prejudices, attitudes and biases, which in turn allow us to create appropriate boundaries. Now for me that's really important if we start thinking and talking about best practice as well. So it's not only a prescribed standard, it's also defined and influenced and formed by our own systems, our own value systems. And ethics are there so that we don't have boundary issues and conflicts, ambiguity and ethical dilemmas. And today I guess that's what we'll be talking about a little bit is what happens when we do get those shades of gray. What happens when we do get boundary blurring? And in what situations do we get those things? So ethics is about encouraging thinking above the dilemma itself. Does that resonate with anybody particularly? Ethics is encouraging thinking above the dilemma itself. When we're talking about the shades of gray in ethics, what we're actually doing is we actually start looking and worrying about what the concern is. If it's a complaint, we're focusing on the accusation or the allegation being raised against us. If it's something we've done and we're doing a reflective process, and hopefully we do do reflective processes, we usually sit in the dilemma. But I'm suggesting that ethics is about thinking outside that box, almost like that developmental growth journey toward best practice. We need to look above the dilemma because we tend to get stuck in it because it's quite negative, quite heavy, quite emotive, quite laden with the client's traumas, grief, loss, whatever they're preventing. So what happens then if we aren't ethical, if we are actually unethical? What happens? Anyone want to say? I can just keep reading, but I prefer- 

00:07:25
[sil.] 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN I guess you first have to define ethical. You know, there's your first gray area, like in the last lecture here that was about Facebook and LinkedIn. And there was this whole thing of well, then your client might know who other clients are there's this breach of confidence. And I was saying, well look, you know, maybe I'm naive. But people end up in my waiting room and they therefore know that, and I live in a small town, so they know that the other person is, and it's like people were shocked and horrified that I don't have this through flow in that there's a separate empty room and it's all very hygienic. No one crosses any diaphanous lines. And I went, Oh my God. Maybe I'm being unethical. But I don't think I am. So, you know, I guess that's- (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
STACEY LLOYD All right. So what makes you sort of, what's the thinking around knowing that you're not being unethical? What holds you to know that that's not correct assumption? 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN I'm not a Freudian. I think the notion that you can actually draw lines around this stuff might be fine in a city where you've got notions of anonymity because you've got the nuclear family where no one knows where anyone is and you only meet for coffee. You never actually know where the other person lives. In a small town, that's just bullocks. So, I guess for me, you know, while you were saying in the last slide, you know, there's rules that people can set. I guess the question is where are those people living? On what basis are they doing those ethics? If they're doing it in the city, then it's probably quite reasonable to say, look, we want this level of lines. And then there are other situations where it's just not going to happen. 

00:09:25
STACEY LLOYD And those situations definitely do also happen in the city. I know I can have two people coming in, and have, whether you want to call it coincidences, I know I'm not being unethical because I didn't set it up. So where I've had people that have been best men at each other's wedding 15 years prior and they're not both seeing me through their separations, separately. I've had people having affairs. I've had the affair come out of a session as the wife of the person, of the husband, is waiting in the reception room to go into a session. They didn't actually see each other, which is really interesting. But they were literally standing within half a meter. And I think that's part, that's a really good point, that's part of the fallacies. Presume that that stuff only happens in certain places, whether it's a small town or whatever. But I guess the bottom line is as long as you're actively maintaining confidence and you're not deliberately, you know, stalking clients online, Facebook and checking out who knows who before they come, I mean, seriously. And that's why the slide before talked about thinking beyond, thinking above the dilemma itself. Because if we went by the code of conduct all the time, we'd certainly need to be understanding it. My goodness, we'd all be doing probably some fairly interesting stuff. Did you want to comment? No? All right. So yeah. So we know that unethical behavior can cause harm. We know that it can undermine the willingness of clients to seek professional help. We know that it can, it's beginning to have litigious or legal ramifications. Nothing's been successfully prosecuted in a counselor's actually been successfully sued. But as we move toward regulation, if that's where we go with the profession, we're going to be a little bit more exposed. And I guess it can lead to harm to the client. But what about ethics for the counselor? So not the counselor practicing ethics, but what about our confidence and maintaining our privacy and all these other things. There's a flip side and that's why I talk about best practice being something that we grow toward and grow in. It's a two way street. So we kind of know that stuff. But a good question was asked. You know, what is ethical? What are people's thoughts about what ethical behavior is? It's pretty clear what unethical does. But what does ethical-, what is ethical behavior? 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN It's in the eye of the beholder, I mean, on a certain level. And I think that in itself is the dilemma. And I think it's particularly at places like this where, I mean, counselors actually on a certain level don't get out much, don't mix much. And there's all sorts of professional jealousies which means you don't really disclose much because you're terrified you might be doing it wrong. Which is why I wanted to come have a chat about all the stuff that's very challenging. I mean, you know, like stuff around professionalism and when you're either asked to help people who are either friends or family in situations where nothing else is available. And then the issue between ethical and moral and the issue of harm that's to do with is it going to be less harmful to help because more harm's going to happen if you do nothing. Does that make sense? Did I say that in a way that- (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
STACEY LLOYD So you're talking about dual relationships? 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN I'm just saying- (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
STACEY LLOYD If you were to put an ethical term to it? 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, in other words, if you say, well I can't work with you because you're a friend or you're a family or whatever. And there's nothing else available, which means that-, and the situation is dire. That's a dilemma. 

00:13:30
STACEY LLOYD Absolutely. 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN And you might do something that on paper is unethical but is actually a more moral thing to do. And I'm not even sure what the difference is between ethical and moral, really. 

00:13:40
6 principles underpinning ethical practice Beneficence: a counselor must accept responsibility for promoting what is good for the client with the expectation that the client will benefit from the counseling sessions. Nonmaleficence: "doing no harm" The counselor must avoid at all times, (even inadvertently) any activities or advances with the client that could create a conflict of interest Autonomy: The counselor's clinical responsibility to encourage client independent thinking and decision making, and to deter all forms of client dependency. 

00:13:40
STACEY LLOYD That's right. So, except that one is prescribed in a professional context, although we can be ethically appropriate or inappropriate in personal as well. And moral tends to lead to those, or come from or been with those values and virtues. And you're right. It does-, and that's why boundary blurring actually happens. I guess that the prescriptive is that you don't, you try to avoid dual relationships. I don't know that it's definitive and says you shouldn't do them. I know out there, people would go ooh, you know, why would you counsel a friend and stuff. But I've guess you've got to weigh up. And that's where ethics become very gray because it becomes very discretionary. It becomes about your experience, your professionalism and all these other things. And you're using your discretions to work with the best interests of the client to avoid some of that stuff. I'd definitely do it under supervision. I'd let someone know about it if you were doing it though. Because I guess the thing with ethics is it's all good until something goes astray or askew. And that's why it's so difficult and challenging when we have these conversations in the profession. And there's a lot of stuff that doesn't get discussed. So I applaud your transparency in bringing that up. Is that, you know, we're constantly trying to be professional in all these things, but what happens when a client sees that as something different? What happens when a client starts to decide that you're no longer professional? And it's usually when you're not doing something that they want you to do. And that very thing may be something that's not ethical to start with. Hence why we terminate. So ethics are a great, a set standard by which you work by. But discretion, values, morals, all come into it. And it is a huge, huge melting pot of debate, which is why I find it quite interesting, particularly with counselors because there's so many different ideas out there as to what the profession is and isn't and professional is and isn't. Little bit different in psychology and social work because it's actually prescribed a little more. These are your boxes and this is where you operate. Counseling, we have the boxes, but we still have the flexibility by virtue of being therapists and practitioners, to work in and out of those boxes. Because what happens when you're a EMDR therapist? You're using touch to actually work with people. You're a Freudian or a Gestalt therapist. You're actually also using some fairly confrontational kind of processes. So counselors are so, I guess, eclectic and broad, or counseling, that we end up with this disparity between, you know, do good and do no harm, which is that beneficence and nonmaleficence. So, yeah. It's huge. It's huge. But it's people like us, the practitioners, the students coming through that actually can help inform without any politics, inform what actually starts to happen. Because you can have someone up here prescribing this stuff. But if they're not practicing, it's really quite difficult. So we'll get into-, have a think about some other ethical dilemmas that are there, because I'd love to have those conversations a little bit further along as well. So, you know, you've probably seen this before. Korig (ph) proposed five originally, six principles underpinning ethical practices. Beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, justice, fidelity and veracity, which are on the next slide. So this is basically what, I know certainly, the ACA code of conduct, I know the PACFA code of conduct, are definitely based on these six core principles. Which is interesting in itself because that's just a prescription. Okay. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay, I'm going to ask around the dependency thing, which it sounds very good, very nobly intended, but having worked with extremely dissociative clients who've had extreme trauma where they never-, there was nothing they could ever depend on- 

00:18:20
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN I started off doing, well, need to do this. Then realized this is a very long process and they actually need to be modeled that it's okay to be dependent until you become independent because they actually have to go through those stages of being able to be dependent in order to be able to get to be independent. So you're kind of doing the essence of what's intended there, but it's not what it says on paper. 

00:18:50
STACEY LLOYD No. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN So I'm just bringing that up to throw the spanner. 

00:18:55
STACEY LLOYD No, no. You didn't throw a spanner at all. You know, and that's the thing, I guess, with practice and that whole thing about, you know, growing and professionalism. We do all start with this slate of yeah, do no harm, do good. You've seen that there's those two different terminologies, do no harm and do good, very interesting. Is that we do end up working out what works for us and more so what works in the best interests of the client, which for me is where the best practice stuff starts to come out of, that whole being ethical and being professional, moral, virtuous and those things. That's the point where it opens up because you kind of go, Well, I kind of was at a point where I see these clients doing this and I see them getting stuck. And then for some reason I did this, which might be your movement, your metaphor from dependence to independence. And wow. Sessions time frame shorten, outcomes increase, efficacies a lot stronger, whatever it is. So you start doing that. That then becomes what we call your practice framework. And that's when this stuff starts to go a little bit more to the background and you start being able to become a little more discretionary. But are you working outside an ethical guideline? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:20:10
STACEY LLOYD It depends. 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Well, on paper. 

00:20:10
STACEY LLOYD On paper, yes. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN When I read that, I go, oh, naughty boy, must be punished. You know? Because, well, that does say at the law that's what's, you know, on the two tablets. And I guess yeah, I don't have an answer. I only have some very challenging questions, you know? 

00:20:40
Justice: the counsellor's commitment to provide an equal and fair service so all clients regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, disability and socio-economic status. Fidelity: being honest with clients and faithfully honouring the counsellor's commitment to the client's progress. Veracity: to be truthful. To act in an honest manner with clients. 

00:20:40
STACEY LLOYD That's okay. But the question from me to you is, with seeing that and going, ooh, on paper I'm not doing that, does it make you want to change the way you work with your clients knowing what you achieve with doing it in a way that's still ethical, providing you've had, you know, no complaints and those sort of things, which I'm presuming hasn't happened. You're working with highly dysfunctional mental health if you're working with dissociatives there's a chance for that sort of complaint process to happen in any case regardless of what you do or don't do. But does it perturb to you to actually have to go back to this stuff? Or does it sort of go, okay what do I need to think about? 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN No more than the dilemmas of, you know, stuff that I do that's not legally right, but it is morally right. When laws aren't moral. And I guess that's the issue, you know? Stuff that groups of people put down on paper because they can, that are useful to a degree in terms of, you know, a group environment, living together in a community and whatever. But then there's gray areas. So, that's my position on it. 

00:21:50
The role of values in your work: PERSONAL MORAL QUALITIES Dignity Sincerity Integrity Humanity Assistance Honesty Competence Fairness 

00:21:50
STACEY LLOYD Yeah, and that's it. And we're working in that constantly. The other thing is ethics aren't, I guess that's another sort of, maybe a fallacy that operates as well, is that, you know, ethics and law are two different things. They interrelate and we'll talk about that in slides a couple forward. And that's why ethics are a standard that are set. But it is presumed that's the law, which is why when people deviate from this they have conniptions. Why ethics panels sometimes, although the professional conduct panel that I sit on tend to know these as a grounding but don't particularly hear ethics complaints around other goodness. They didn't do this, this and this. It's too hard. You can't fit people in those boxes. Counselors don't like to put people in boxes themself. So we do start to move away with it. I think probably things like, you know, veracity would be part of our character though, values and attitudes that we have anyway. Fidelity, you know, is something that we probably have in our natures as well. They're probably not things we need to worry too much about. Justice, we all sort of come probably from a justice and fairness model, which is why when we have, you know, a system that's dictating to us whether it's ethics, whether it's law, we get confused or we get conflicted because law and justice are two different things. Okay. So the other thing is, is that, I'm not sure totally about ACA, but I certainly know that PACFA code of ethics has actually embedded certain values, which they're there, into the code of ethics document. So everything is written around being able to deliver or possess. 

00:23:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:23:45
STACEY LLOYD Yes. Sure. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN Just because similarly, while it looks good on paper, the notions of honesty and truthfulness, there's huge dilemmas like for example, around disclosure, whereby in a lot of cases you're saying, Well, because I don't want to disclose ... you're actually not being at all honest. You're not being at all truthful and well, I often have clients who will eyeball me and say, Do you think this, feel this? Have you ever done this? And you're put in that situation where two ethics collide. 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Sorry, I really don't know anything about this with counseling, but as a coach and from working with people and a teacher, I don't see anything you're doing is unethical. And I keep thinking you're actually pulling stuff out and teasing it out into too much detail. My question is are any of those stand alone? They wouldn't be. It always comes back to are you causing harm to the client. Like, when you talked about dependency, but when you spoke about it the context you gave was but I want to get that person to be independent. But because of where they're at at the moment, they're not. But that's where we're going. So that's not unethical, what you're doing. Of course, they've got to start somewhere. But your goal- 

00:25:20
STACEY LLOYD It's how you practice. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN But your goal is to get them to independence as soon as you can. For some it might take two weeks. For some it's going to take two years. You are acting ethically. Of course, we can't disclose everything because it's not about me as a counselor. It's about the client. I'm not being dishonest in not disclosing. I just choose not to disclose certain things because it's not appropriate for my client because I don't want to cause them harm. So we keep coming back to we're not causing harm. We're ethical. So I actually see everything you're doing is ethical. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN So yeah. So yeah. 

00:25:55
STACEY LLOYD Because you're working in the best interest of the client. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Always. 

00:25:55
STACEY LLOYD And I think that's really important. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN That's underpinning everything that we do. It's just that we have to tease this sort of stuff out because there are always people, unfortunately in any profession, that act right on the edge, can that breach this. And they do cause problems. 

00:26:10
STACEY LLOYD We'll only believe in this. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:10
STACEY LLOYD Which is why your point's very valid. Only believe in, this is what we have to go with. And the problem is they're going to be constantly creating conflict and then go to remiss for themselves. That's why I called what you do in practice (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN So my question is then- 

00:26:25
STACEY LLOYD Thank you. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Given that there's-, yeah, thank you for that. Why are apologizing? I appreciate it. Given that you're involved in this, why doesn't the way that this is set out actually include some level of talking about it with some level of duality that talks about how it is most of the time in the bell curve and how it is relative to the extremes on either side. So that it doesn't look like, thus sayeth the law. 

00:27:05
STACEY LLOYD I agree. That's right. That's right. I've added the word best practice into this- 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Well, my question to you is do you know why it is that-, or is it just kind of, counseling's in that kind of parenting stage and hasn't quite got to witherdom yet? 

00:27:20
STACEY LLOYD I think it's probably a bit of both of that. I think it's probably counseling's obviously growing. We're certainly in the, past the infant stage. Definitely, well it's been 13 years now, these debates. Yeah. We're actually probably going to late adolescence. So only a couple of years away from whatever's going to be is going to be. But I guess, you know, you're right. When the problem, I guess, with the people that make decisions around ethics codes and the committees and stuff are usually, and I mean I can't totally say, but are usually quite heavily involved in the academic, the black and white side of ethics. So they're talking about consultation and actually practice in forming ethics as opposed to ethics informing practice. For me there's a huge, a huge gap. And you just identified it, because that's what happens. Ethics is usually something that goes, ethics define a profession. But it could go the other way. How does the profession define. And I think that's some of the good stuff that will start to happen now as we're moving beyond the politics of the infancy and adolescence, to actually start having that feedback and those consultations. And I'd actually encourage you to make sure that your feeding back, not necessarily jumping on committees. You can certainly do that. But they have their own things that go on. But certainly getting involved in that. Usually political is a whole other level. But I think it's also because ethics are considered to be like a law even though the definition I presented to you was that it's a standard. It's a benchmark. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN Can I just add that one of the other workshops, talks, was around something that involved the DSM-5, that of course is one of these committees and how they actually for whatever reason, decided that all of the committee was sworn to secrecy. So there's no honesty, no truth, because of all of those processes and they mean to be, you know, who we're looking up to. 

00:29:35
STACEY LLOYD I can't say that. But you can-. Yeah, I know, but that's my point. That's my point. Is that the gap comes not just in our everyday practice, and I guess that's the level that I want to talk to you about. But it's even bigger when you start to see it at that kind of, it's not really a regulatory level, but certainly a, yeah. We'll just say higher level, yeah? And that's why, I guess, we've got to get more impassioned and just continue to do what you do. Because we get scared otherwise. There's so much and you were right when you said earlier around these, I find them great forums, for not with you guys here, regardless of size of group, great forums in networking and stuff. But I have to say, so many people because you see, they talk and then they go. It's like, well, it's okay. I'm actually having a conversation with you. I'm not analyzing. And it may not be anything unethical. I'm not analyzing. I'm not interpreting. I'm literally just, if you want me to say, I'm being brain dead. I'm just conversing. And, you know, to back that up, most of the complaints, again not ACA, that we hear on the professional conduct panel are actually members against members. From these kind of-, yeah. Don't get that out there. They are. They're members against members. So when the, you know, you have a conversation with someone and they happen to say, you know, part of my work is I believe in regressing clients regardless of the issues. I work with trauma. This isn't me, by the way. I work with trauma. And part of what I do is actually regress them back to infancy. It's a regression therapist or Freudian. It's that kind of latent therapist. In that conversation, they're talking to a Gestalt therapist or a general therapist, right? One of those two will get a bit ee-ee about the other one because it's a lack of understanding. It's actually got nothing to do with ethics, unless they say they were sleeping with the client to take them back to their sexual trauma. That might be slightly different. But that's not the stuff we're dealing with. And so we have this professional, it's a professional miscommunication. And then the next layer that comes into that is yeah, well clearly the person's ethical because they've only been practicing for what, two year? And I've been practicing for 20. The complaints usually made by the person that sees themselves as the (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Should I worry right now? 

00:32:20
STACEY LLOYD No. No, not at all. Not at all. The other part is, is that I'm sure, you know, we're human. There has to be times when we have actually done something that borders on, and without making any admissions, or is potentially, possibly is, unethical. But, most of the time it's unintentional. And the difference is, as long as you're prepared to actually learn from that experience, you can't be deemed, I know complaints can come, but it can't be deemed as being unethical practice. Unethical practice implies you do it all the time. So you might practice a certain way, which for me is your practice framework, nothing to do with your inability to be ethical or professional. That's just how you've adapted over all these years. I have too. Stuff that I do now, that probably 15 years ago when I first started, I probably, if I actually thought about it, and you're going to make me now. If I actually thought about it, I'd go ooh. And I do do that sometimes. I do think, you know, when we talk about disclosure. In my head, just to go back to your point about that, with disclosure, there's always that thing in the back of your head. The line is, how is this information going to benefit the client? I get that maybe connecting with them and them relating to us or knowing whether we've had certain experiences is important for them. But is it really important for the therapy clients. And you might think so. That's okay. I might now. That's okay. There might be someone in the middle. That's okay too. And that's what we're dealing with is the shades of gray. So I haven't heard anything that's unethical. And I generally don't because I believe people can change. So, yeah. It's very interesting. And it's very interesting that you've already picked up on some other things that are going on around. I don't think you'll find too many of the other types unless there's any Gestalt's in the room or psychoanalytic therapists. There's not too many of them around. Are you? 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN I'm not saying. 

00:34:30
STACEY LLOYD You know, I don't think you need to fear it. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:34:35
STACEY LLOYD I think those conversations need to be encouraged because the bottom line is regardless of whether we're professional, ethical, have values, attitudes, morals, we're still human. You know? And I think that gets forgotten. In all this stuff, you know, if that's the only thing you take away from today, that can be is the human factor. You know? And supervisees come and they're, you know, whether they're new graduates or they've been experienced for lots of years, I don't think it makes too much difference apart from practice hours. They're like, oh, we got this stuff, you know. A client sent me some flowers. Yeah? But they wrote me a card. Yeah? So, was there kisses in the card? No. Have they done that before? No. Are they still a client? No. Well, what's the context of them sending the flowers? Are you scared? Are they stalking you? No. It was just because they've moved on and they're really grateful because had they engaged with me in the program I was running, they couldn't get to where they are now. So it where a guy was, had addiction issues and over a course of a few years connected with this counselor who really, obviously, empowered him like never before to the point where he could become a facilitator in a drug rehab program. And the flowers came like two years after. So it's like, but some people still freak out about that stuff. But if there's, you know, those certain questions can be alleviated. And she was like, Oh, I didn't know whether to tell you or not. What was I going to do about it? I won't, you know, she said oh, you could have reported me. For what part of the ethics code? She said, I'm not sure. That's why you're the supervisor. It's that kind of stuff. 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN Well, I think, you know, when I hear stories like that- The essence of the written word ethics become in essence doing the opposite of what they're actually trying to do because, and this hops back to this honesty thing. The counselor, and you know, it's like, I supervise you know, younger counselors. And they get just paranoid that while we talk about the therapeutic alliance, they're so far away from anything resembling being able to be a human being with another human being who's coming into the room, you know, very uncomfortable, coming into someone's room who is even more uncomfortable than they are because they're so worried about this stuff. And I'm not saying that it doesn't need to be there. I'm saying that there ideally would be someone like you as-, or that it's written in a way that actually makes it more human rather than because we want to be seen by the government as this, that and the other. That we end up looking like the government, which is a very blunt tool and actually isn't that useful from the point of view of actually getting the result that it's trying to do. 

00:37:50
Reflecting on our values etc. & ethical practice Is it ever justified to influence a client's own values? If so, when and in what circumstances? Would you worry about openly discussing your values with certain clients? What type of clients? If you were concerned your client was making a self destructive decision, would you express your concerns, and if so, how would you do this? Do you think as a therapist you are responsible for informing clients about a variety of 'value' options? Can you remain true to yourself and at the same time allow your clients to select and act on their own values, even where they differ from yours? How would you determine when there's a conflict emerging between your values and those of your client? 

00:37:55
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. And that's why, again, you know, to be repetitive on purpose, that whole, you know, have we moved away from it being-, ethics as being standard informing practice. Or is ethics standard that is practice. And that's the other part of the coin and still on the side of the coin as well is that whole move to be seen as , what do you call that? Like that legalistic language. And you can see that. You can see the change in the ethics documents because it used to be codes of conduct. They're now ethics documents. what is that change in language? You know, what is the process behind that. And yes there are people that don't do the right thing. And I do think we have to take it seriously. But I don't know in every state of Australia and everywhere else that I work overseas and here, I've probably come across one scenario given to me in supervision that was definitely not ethical. And I can't tell you what that is. And one supervisee that I was directly working with who definitely wasn't ethical. But, that was in that moment. If she tries to change what she was doing, and it was around dual relationships, so it was around counseling a colleague at work when the wife of the colleague also worked at that work. And the husband was having an affair with one of her friends. Yeah. So my thing is, if it does your head in to think about this, it's bordering on boundary blurring. And so, you know, you've kind of got to go, well, you're telling me because it's not feeling right. So already something's gone on. Is it this? Is it your practice? What is it? You need to change that because it's going to turn really ugly very quickly. And then too much is at stake. Work, jobs, people, wives, families, too much. But she chose not to change it. And it turned to (inaudible ). Yeah, she's not practicing now, that I've ever had to report up, The other one was a supervisee came to me working with a social worker who specialized in DID, disocio iden (ph) disorder. And sexual trauma. So it's sort of linking that together. And the social worker came with her new partner, who happened to be someone she was having an affair with because he was married, except that her new partner, the person she was having the affair with, was actually her client. Now this social worker had-, see it's pretty clear. This social worker had her own trauma, sexual trauma and had been over her years, she'd been practicing for 13 or 14 years, used that as a therapy. You know, get over your own trauma by, you know, being with someone else's trauma and sleeping with the clients. So, you sort of go, that's kind of complicated and if I was working with those clients I'd be gone. Can't do it. You need to-, so I reported it up as well. Not on my supervisee at that point unless she terminated. But then she calls me a few months later, because I said wait, now I can't work with you because I'm the one that goes down if you go down, as your supervisor. She rang me a few months later and she said oh, it's gone really bad. Oh really? What's happened? And she said, well, I did stop. Well, that relationship broke up and I did stop counseling that particular social worker and her partner. But I did start counseling the couple, the husband and the wife. So, and this is someone, you know, this supervisee, you know, is someone who I'd look up to, you know? She's pretty switched on and has been practicing for years. And that, for me, it was about the conversation of at which point did that become okay? Because as much as we said that what you disclose before, you know, was appropriate with your practice framework. There's a point in that example where it changed. Something changed for her. That point was that she felt that she needed challenges. It started to become personal, as in I need a challenge. I need clients that are complicated. So I don't know any clients that aren't. I actually don't know myself who isn't complicated. But, you know, so there's those extremes. But most of the time what you will see in ethics complaints are things like dual relationships, which we'll talk a bit more, breaches of confidentiality are the really big ones. And peers on peers. I won't go through-, they're just some considerations there. But I will ask you to ask these questions because these are really interesting. I guess I know what your answers would be. Is it every justified to influence a client's own values? If so, when and in what circumstances? And it's from the same person that wrote those six principles underpinning- 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I wanted to go back to those six, but these are, I guess, more in detail. Go through if you want. 

00:43:20
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. So, is it ever justified? Would you ever? You know, you're allowed your own opinion. Is it ever justified to influence a client's own values? 

00:43:35
[sil.] 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN So are you asking us? 

00:43:40
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Does anyone else want to- 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:45
STACEY LLOYD And they're nodding. So good. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Well, you know, I immediately think of suicidality. You know? 

00:43:55
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Where there's like I said, what's going to happen if you do something, but also having to be aware of what's going to happen if you do nothing, which looks like do no harm. But in my experience, it's not actually how it comes down on reality. 

00:44:15
STACEY LLOYD No, because there's something else that overrides all of this stuff, which is called duty of care. And, that is actually the exception in the context of self harm and suicide. But you'd be really surprised, you know, because it's something I purposely prod people with and provoke responses from. How many people will go, No, you can't ever do that. And then when it comes up that someone says suicide, they'll go-. And I'll say does anyone-? So people wouldn't assess suicide and they wouldn't deal with it. Yeah, of course you would. And then have the conversation from there. It's true. Would you worry about openly discussing your values with certain, it's double up, with certain clients? If so, what type of clients? Again, it depends on your relationship with them, as an appropriate relationship with them. You know, if you're convinced they're making, similar as the first one, as self destructive decision, would you express your concerns? Of course, duty of care says we have to, let alone humanness. You know, do you think as a therapist you're responsible for informing clients about a variety of value options? Yeah, the steps from dependence to independence. Or, you know, if you do this, you know that this, this, this will happen, because it's what you've been living for the last 20 years. But I wonder what happens if we do this or this? A choice. Can you remain, so truth, can you remain true to yourself and at the same time allow your clients to select and act on their own values even when they differ from yours? Yeah. And how would you determine when there's a conflict emerging between your values and those of your client's? That's probably a really valid one that's probably good to discuss. How do you know if there's a conflict emerging? 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN They usually say so or look like so. 

00:46:05
STACEY LLOYD Yeah, well the body language changes. There's a tension. Or they'll say-, or they just won't turn up. And whether you follow it up is up to you. Go on. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN I guess, you know, I'm a little bit more interested in this whole thing, because it relates back to the honesty and the whole thing of where there's this notion that, you know, and I think it comes from Freudian and whatever. It's meant to be these lines and somehow you're meant to be behind the line and all of your values are meant to be over here. And you're sitting in this neutral zone that's completely non-judgmental. And that's the ante room from which you do your counseling. And of course there's this other line between you and the counselor. So there's no transference and counter transference. 

00:46:55
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Which is a bit like, I don't know, changing film in a camera with these glovie (ph) things that might actually do a job but there's no relationship actually going on. So the whole issue of- 

00:47:10
[sil.] 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN And I'm not talking about hitting people over with a softball bat of whatever your values are. 

00:47:20
STACEY LLOYD Right. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN But this thing of permission to be who you are-. I mean, I guess I look at it from a different point of view. [sil.] think we're all incredibly judgmental and subjective just because of whatever upbringing or whatever it is. And the issue for me is being aware of that so that it's not affecting the relationship, which if I'm trying to hide it, is going to, not overtly, but I think definitely from a therapeutic alliance point of view. So I think this whole issue of how do you sit with yourself and then it becomes this issue of when you're in a relationship with a client, who you're honestly sitting there wanting to encourage them to be open and honest. Now, how do you do that if you're hiding behind something that's well, I'm not going to be open and honest with you because I've got these ethical constraints as opposed to actually going, well, here are all my biases and my prejudices. And now we're having a relationship that hopefully isn't going to bring those in and, you know, smear them over you. But I can't say that they're not there from the point of view of my gender, from the point of view of whatever religious background of whatever it is. As opposed to what often happens is this kind of silent gap that, you know, therapeutic alliances go down the toilet, because of what is a really challenging area. Which is why for me, the things that I'm trying to tease out here is the word values. 

00:49:15
STACEY LLOYD Values, yeah. Yeah. I guess it goes back to the point earlier around, you know, you can debate all day and go round and round in circles and probably still not get an answer. To say, you know, because we're all different. You know, what is appropriate disclosure? To benefit an alliance or a relationship or a client versus non? Because it depends where you're at too, that whole subjective thing. But I guess, as said, as long as in the back of your mind, you're working with and for, not withstanding your therapeutic modality, the client. Then that's all that really-, that's the baseline. And all this is definitely under that and hopefully holding that up as opposed to everything going around it. So it's sort of more linear. You know, I guess, you know, sometimes clients come to you not necessarily wanting you to disclose, but they do seek opinion. You know? And that's another gray area in counseling. We don't give advice. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:50:17
STACEY LLOYD Oh, what a surprise that you would respond that way. Poke, poke. You know? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN I guess I just want to, you know, ask what do people do when their client eyeballs them and says, you know, can you give me some advice on this, that and the other? Do you just sit there and go, No? I mean, I'm asking the question because it happens. 

00:50:45
STACEY LLOYD Well what do other do? What do you think you do? 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). But it doesn't mean that if I'm not happy with where we're going and they haven't-, I'm not going to let them walk out of that room with just nothing. And so they'll be suggestions, but it's always only, again, you know, it is only my-, and I even said that to the client. This is only from where I'm coming from. And there's lots of this out there and that and that and that. But really, let's have a look for you now. 

00:51:15
STACEY LLOYD So you're still acknowledging it though. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:51:15
STACEY LLOYD It's not an elephant in the room. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Because I'm really the student here. Is that right? 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN I'm going to report you. 

00:51:20
STACEY LLOYD Do you say the same? To who? 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN I just wanted to ask- 

00:51:30
STACEY LLOYD It's only for the recording. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN I would actually say the same because I've had parents, I work in a school- 

00:51:35
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN And where they're going through a divorce or whatever, and they just, their brain is just fried, if you know what I mean. And they're like, so what do you think? And I just offer several suggestions because they're so close to the emotion that they're unable to sit back and see the bigger picture. And I find that, you know, by just giving them suggestions and then allying them to make the decision empowers them so that they feel, you know? And you can continue by asking them what do you think about these things, you know? Or what do you feel you need to do? And throw the question back to them, because you're totally empowering them. You're still hearing them. 

00:52:10
STACEY LLOYD That's right. 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN It's the key, you know, to even working whether it be ongoing counseling sessions, or quite often I do one on ones, you know, randomly sort of things like that. To empower them to feel as though they've made some sort of progress is the ultimate outcome. You know? And then they can just move from one state to the next. 

00:52:30
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. Yeah. But it's a natural human, you know, it's innate for people to be curious about people. I mean, there's disclosure and there's personal disclosure, you know? And I think it is pretty clear most of the time. And if you've known clients for a long time as well. I mean, only know in the part is presented for a long time, then you know, you're probably going to be a little different with them which in fact, you will be different with them as opposed to, you know, someone that you've just sort of met. And not because you're trying to impress the person you just met, but because you've got these boundaries, these experiences together, these journeys. And I know that's definitely true for me because, you know, there's people 15 years later that, you know, were 15 year olds when I met them and they're not 30 year olds or 40 year olds are now 55 year olds. Or five year olds and they're now 20 year olds. You see them through those transitions. So yeah, it does it's usually noticeable. It's usually a feeling. There's something that happens in the alliance or in the counseling room. It doesn't have to be a big elephant. When those conflicts are actually, sorry, when those values are conflicting. But it doesn't mean you have to terminate counseling either. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN I'd love to know where did this thing come around, you know, you're not meant to give advice? I'm not saying from the point of view of, I think what it's intent is, which is that because of the power of balance in the relationship, that the person goes, well you've said this. I'm going to go off and do this and I'm going to hold you responsible of course if anything goes wrong. 

00:54:05
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN So it's not that. It's more this thing that isn't almost everything that you actually do, that you wouldn't call advice, advising them to follow a modality, advising-. Do you know what I mean? That it's very, on a certain level, it becomes almost covert, this notion. We don't give advice. We just advise you in all of these different ways and I think one the biggest things that Ann talked about is the issue of the power and balance in the relationship. I think, well certainly from a lot of the supervisees that I work with, they honestly don't take it into-. They don't think about the fact that they think they're going in and the relationship's all very equal. And we're trying to keep it really comfortable. And they're not even thinking about what it is that that client comes in with as their sense of experience. And it's not teased out. So, I guess those are my questions. 

00:55:05
Confidentiality-legal and ethical bases Consent (parental and informed) Privacy Age appropriate language Boundaries Understanding of child development Record keeping Boundaries Dual relationships Disclosure-mandated, compelled by law, discretionary, privilege Professional development and best practice-competence Code of conduct-supervision and training standards 

00:55:05
STACEY LLOYD Yeah, there are always imbalances. I guess that part of the answer to the question as to- I can't remember the first thing you said. With regard to why is it saying that we don't give advice? I guess the ethical answer to that is that there's something else in ethics that says we have to work within our circle of confidence. And I guess it's assumed that advice is something higher than what counselors do. And it's language. Support and facilitate as opposed to advise and mitigate. And I guess it only, again, this only becomes messy if someone actually takes exception and actually makes a complaint. Yeah? So it also comes down to what you practice, how you practice, and how long you've practiced. I mean I've certainly am probably more into, you know, guiding as well as supporting, facilitating outcomes for clients as I am about giving them suggestions which does probably look like advice to someone else. So yeah, there's this other thing that happens called working within your competency. There is also something like duty of care that's the unspoken part of ethics as well. We all hear about it. But it's actually, it needs to be brought out a little bit more. So what are, you know, what are the everyday things that as counselors and therapists that you guys work with? And there they are. That actually do have an ethical basis as well as a practical sort of experience base that cause us issue. Don't be a hand off, just grab the microphone. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Well, the first one that comes up for me is record keeping, because of the time with being subpoenaed and particularly, you know, like relationship stuff. 

00:57:00
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN I'm not willing to have lawyers take my notes out of context in order to, you know, do a party line. Now, I'm aware that some people have these dual record keeping, one for them, one for everyone else. Whereas as I- 

00:57:20
STACEY LLOYD See, that would be unethical and potentially illegal. But anyway, keep going. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN What? There was just someone yesterday said, oh no, I have two, you know. Whereas for me, I just write in pencil and the hieroglyphics that only I understand. And then if anyone wants them, I say, yeah, I'll photocopy them. Go for it. You're welcome. But, they have to subpoena me so that I'm not willing to-, they have to get context. 

00:57:45
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN So, you know, yeah, that's one of my dilemmas. 

00:57:50
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. And I guess the thing with record keeping is, I want to sort of go through most of them. With recordkeeping is that they are your records. It's another sort of thing that's assumed that the client owns the record, except in the context of the court order or subpoena. You know, what you do is what you do. But I agree, I want to be called as an expert as opposed to a lawyer or an ICL or whoever it is interpreting my records. Because I inadvertently could put a child at risk if it's interpreted incorrectly, which of course, the person that always want the record is generally not your client. It's the other side. So it can only be for you. But your record's your record. If someone, what happens if someone asks you, a client, not a lawyer, asks you for a copy of their record? What do you do? Really? Okay. I don't. It's my record. And if they want push to come to shove it, there's a duty of care that I've a right to everything. So there's nothing in that record really. I mean it's all the truth as is reported. It is very subjective though based on what I heard. So that's the issue I have. Is, you know, there could be stuff there that if the client reads it goes back some time, they could actually cause re-trauma. So I go on the grounds of No, you can't have my notes. But what I can do is a summary of counseling progress or a summary statement of counseling. And that's usually what I'll do. I've only ever been asked for records twice in that context. One was a client that I had seen, hadn't see her for six years. And she came back. She'd become a counselor and decided and she needed her record. So that's rings alarm bells, except she was an alcoholic for a very long period of time and drug user and stuff. And there was stuff on that record that wasn't pretty. And I didn't know where she was at. Hadn't see her for six years. So that was fine. And the other one where I gave, and this might be my luck. The other one I gave a record to a long time ago ended up, you know, giving me death threats and stalking me. And ended up in a ten year restraining order eight years ago. So, you know, I guess that's the thing. They're written in truth and honesty, but without the back up of us to actually, not explain or justify, but certainly put the context or the perspective of where we're going, it can be dangerous. So, consult your supervisor with that stuff because there is no consistency across the profession as so what to do. I still hear, you give it over. But the limits of confidentiality say, which is what I'll stick to, this is where ethics works, is under court order or subpoena. For lawyerings and bullies and threatens and stuff, get a subpoena. There's a reason why they're bullying. And the reason they're bullying is one they either can't be bothered going to the court, or two they know they're not going to get a subpoena issued because they don't have enough grounds to get that subpoena issued. So a subpoena isn't issued by a lawyer. Okay? It's issued by a court. Make sure if you get one you comply, particularly in the family court at the moment. Because they are holding professionals accountable to, they always have but, I've had one warrant issued for my arrest, which I did for failure to comply. I did comply, except the subpoena that I was served with expired by two days. So, and I was actually flying out of the country three days later. But apparently I, you know, developed all my travel plans all around the fact that I knew I was going to be in court the day before Christmas. So that was enough to get that warrant. Thankfully I was on a plane with the door shut sitting on the Tarmac in Brisbane and nothing could happen. But did I know whether I was going to get arrested when I came back? No. So, it's getting, yeah. Yeah. And I did, you know, the record had been subpoened. It was about me being subpoened for court, me and a whole bunch of professionals, which we ended up going to court later on. But you know, that was at a cost of nearly five thousand dollars to me because I had to lawyer up, because I literally wasn't going to be in the country. So, you know, there's some stuff that goes on. So unless there's a court order-. Now a court order's different to subpoena. Court order is if you happen to have your name put in an order. And what used to happen, about in the last 18 months, especially in family court or it's not called family court, or Federal Magistrate's Court. It's called the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Is they used to give you a call and go, Hey, we really want to court order you to do some counseling for this child or this situation. Are you happy to do it? Yup, sure. Put you in an order and the order comes down. What seems to be happening now is that professionals are just names being bandied around and popped in order. And next minute, you know that you get a lawyer or someone calling you going, your court ordered to do this. You have to do this. Not really, because I didn't know about it and I don't have capacity. But getting yourself off that court order is difficult. So if you know you're court ordered. You know you're going to have to report to the court. Okay? But confidentiality, yeah, you can object to subpoenas too, but I'd only do it with a lawyer if you want. The other thing with subpoenas is make sure you make it known, depending on the information you've got. If it's going to cause harm, let's say a kid's abused and docs are involved. And your record's got those disclosures because you made the notification. And you know that in the family court that the dad's going to see that record. And you know that he's, well, it's a she, it's presumed the accused of being the perpetrator. But you don't want the dad to see that record. Make sure you make it known, because you can ask for it only to be seen, viewed by the lawyers, not taken, inspected is the word, not copied. There's an inspected and copied criteria. Don't get it copied because anybody can have hold of your record, including the client. And in that particular case, the dad doesn't have access to my record, but I also know that the police are waiting to charge him with the offenses. But they can't do that until family court's over. But the bottom line is if he had my record, he'd have, he'd know exactly what the police had. Because clearly my record's my police statement. So, there's all these other things that go on. And the more we move toward regulation, the more transparent we're going to be. Because at the moment counselors aren't seen as clearly by the courts as what we're going to be. So you need to be aware of all that. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN Can I bring in the-, I can't remember whether it's a 16A or something. It's a child protection- 

01:05:00
STACEY LLOYD The child protection one? 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN That the doc does. 

01:05:05
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

01:05:05
UNKNOWN And- 

01:05:05
STACEY LLOYD It's like a block they send you, a cutout of the- 

01:05:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. And here's my dilemma that I just want to float, just because it's current. A client who ended up with images on his computer that he shouldn't have had that came with like, 90 percent of other stuff that was what he was interested in. This kind of ended up there as well. Unaware that it was hugely illegal and hugely problematic. And six months after, he was arrested. Docs finally decided Oh, this is a child protection issue. And he's you know, not able to see his two year old kid. And even though the police had said at the time, because the wife had said look, should I worry? And they said, No, because most of the stuff has nothing to do with even like the age group or anything. Docs have this systematic decision making something or another that's how they decide that he's actually hugely high risk to hurting his child. I'm the only one that actually knows the guy. I've worked with him for like nine months. No one else has actually had a conversation about how did it happen? It's all just a fact sheet. 

01:06:40
STACEY LLOYD Did the police obviously weren't too concerned at this point? 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN Yes, you know, but being in a small town, having a, you know, ongoing relationship with docs, I noticed within myself this dilemma whereby I know this guy. Now, there is a one percent chance that he could be this person who starting pedophile rings all over. It's just, you know, 30 years of experience tells me that that's not what's going on. And of course, they're asking me for my report when they've already judge, jury and executioner. And my dilemma is I want to put the truth because it's my truth. I don't want them thinking that I'm some naive twat counselor who, you know, just believes anything that everybody tells me. And I just want to float that dilemma. 

01:07:40
STACEY LLOYD Yup. 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN Because I noticed, you know, I'm usually quite kind of forthright. And look, the truth's the truth as far as I know it. I could be wrong, but whatever. And I noticed myself, I was nervous. I was going mmmm. And I was almost putting my reputation. I wanted to take the line of be noncommittal. And I was kind of in this dilemma between well, I can be noncommittal and look after me. I'm not this father who's not getting to see his two year old. I'm not this two year old who's not getting to see his father. And I'm, just interested in others- 

01:08:15
STACEY LLOYD No, but, but your role is that, you know, you're the professional that's worked with this guy. And I guess the first thing was I wouldn't hand over my notes, even with that thing. But the report is something different. And you can, you can only write your report with your truth. And of course, it's going to be biased because he's the only one you've worked with. And sometimes you do have to cop that. I cop it a lot. And it's kind of like, well, I was only working with one part. But imagine what would have happened to me, you know, if I'd worked with all of them anyway from an ethical and a boundary point of view. But, you probably need to, I'm not going to say have to or should, write that report. 

01:08:55
UNKNOWN Can you just say more about, just because I'd like to have more of the experience than just my own around copping it. You know? And how you- 

01:09:00
STACEY LLOYD Copping it in the context of you know, you go to court. You be a witness. And you know, you've worked with a kid that you know, Mom has hit him with a cricket bat and you get court ordered without you knowing that you've got to do re-introduction counseling between the mom and son. Don't worry about the trauma. Just they've got to be in a room together by this date. So you've got a ten year old who's 95 kilos who's been hit by a cricket bat. Child psych decided there's not risk so we'll go through the-. Now, the flip side. So, I see him get court ordered to do this re-introduction. So, I talked to my mother fine. I really clearly get the juice that there's some pretty significant mental illness happening. Probably a pay day. And she tells me that, you know, he will be going home with her the day of the meeting. Well, no. That's not part of it. You need to do this, this and this. And please don't talk to him about the incident. Let him lead the discussion, because that's what I prepared him for. And whatever. But, you know, I'd do it again. No, I don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear that stuff. You won't-, anyway, whatever. She came to the, and please don't bring anybody because he'd also been beaten by his grandfather. So Mom turns up. So I'm with this kid 45 minutes, comes in the back door. Is already a wreck, vomiting, having this panic attack. And then Mom turns up with Grandma and Grandpa. It's a Saturday. No one's around but me. Dad and the son are in the room, another room. Told them to lock themself in. And, you know, I said, well they can't come in. That's not the process. And so Mom comes in. I sit with the boy on this side of the table, because I do it over a table on purpose. And Mom sits there. And I have a 95 kilo boy sitting on me, bawling his eyes out on the table. Not once, and this is my judgment, not once did that mom try, thankfully, to reach out to him and say, Hey son, how are you doing? Which is, I kind of said to her, probably a good idea to just ask him about cricket, not the bug, but cricket, or stuff. But no. She sat there. And she started. You know, this is why you know, if you do this again or if you do this and you don't snap out of it, I'd hit you again. So I'd never, ever, ever reacted with a client. After the fact I have. I did with this client. But it wasn't unethical. I didn't say what I really wanted to say. And I went on and on and on. So we tried to do some cards and take it away. And I said to him, Mate, do you want to like, sit with Mom and tell her what you need? And Mom just basically wiped all the kid's needs cards off the table and she said, you just need to live with me. Your dad has made this up. Your dad, and all this stuff about Dad. And I'm like, there's no progress here at all. So I kicked her out after about 20 minutes. So the problem then is, that I am still accountable to the court. So I've got her lawyer bearing down on me like within two hours on this Saturday. Dad's lawyer was cool. I had ICL on me as well. And then the magistrate. Thankfully the magistrate I worked with before. He was fine. 

01:12:25
UNKNOWN What is ICL? 

01:12:25
STACEY LLOYD Independent Children's Lawyer. The one that's supposed to represent the child. So, you know, that was the first part of the crucifixion. So two years later, when it gets to court, and this is the warrant one, and Mom's spent 400,000 hiring a CU from Sydney to prosecute this case. The prosecution. You know, four hours I was questioned about well, if this child was at risk, why did I facilitate the joint session? Well, if I didn't I would have been in contempt of court and I probably would have gone to jail. Oh, but that doesn't matter. Didn't you say that duty of care is really important? Because they wanted to know why I made another notification when Child Safety had already closed the file. Because I have a duty of care. It was other things he was disclosing. You know, so he said-, so then it just went on and on. Four hours of the same thing. You know, where in your notes? Two years of notes? Where in notes does it say a dollar sign? Uhm, I'm not sure. Where, you know, Miss Lloyd, where does it say that? Uhm, maybe you could like tell me the page number because I had everything meticulous. Magistrate intervened so tells me. And he says, so the dollar sign, what does that refer to? I said it refers to the fact he was worried about money because Dad has lost his job. Oh, so there's a chance Dad could have put these ideas in his head about Mom. You know? And that's what I mean by crucified. I held it together, and everything else. But it was about everything but, not one question came about the impact on this child and the impact of this child going back into her care. So I left there livid. And I have vowed never to do any more family court work again except for mediation. So, you know, it's the system as well. But Child Safety was in that. You know? Child Safety's in another one at the moment where I did exactly that report about a three and a half year old that was showing me her abuse and inviting me in to do abuse on her. And reported it. I did two sessions because it was too traumatic. And you know, it's kind of like the lawyers want transcripts and the recordings of my interview and a copy of the questions I asked her. Who keeps that? But also in Child Safety work I'd closed a case just before my second session with her. And I said to them please keep it open. I'm seeing her this afternoon. It's the most horrific abuse I've heard in my whole career. They closed it. So I get a call from the Child Safety officer telling me that I've lied. That I've made all these disclosures up. Okay, why? Why? Because I interviewed the child in August and she was fine. She didn't talk about her Dad the way she talked to you in October. Okay. Where were you when you-, I already knew the Child Safety worker was. Where'd this interview take place? Oh, at her Dad's house. What was the child doing, like this has all been breaches of confidentiality, but not mine. She was. Uhm, you know, she was, she's got developmental delay and she was like all over his lap and you know, trying to like put her hands down his shirt. Okay. So what did my notifications talk about? She goes, oh, that kind of stuff. So how long have you worked for Child Safety? Oh, not long. Won't be long. You know, what is, and then I talked her through the cycle of violence and predatory behavior. And the pin dropped. She realized she was wrong. Problem was, between August and October, she'd close the case. She'd written a statement contradicting everything that all of us as professionals have now, like four of us have said the same thing. But we now have a Child Safety officer report that says it doesn't exist. There's a chance we've all made it up. Now, that's when I say, I don't care about being crucified, but unintentionally that child is potentially at risk now. Because now there's doubt. Child Safety said it wasn't substantiated. But now we've got these four professionals saying, and we haven't spoken, the professionals, I only know because the ICS told me, who are saying something different. Can't be that we've all got the same story. Has to be that someone's made something up. So, you know, back to your case. I see a similar situation but I do think, you know, and that's the thing where we do get in a dilemma. You've got to go, How is this going to be in that I'm confounded by the crisis. I've got to do something but how do I act in my client's best interest and tell the truth, which is what the problem with those two sets of records is. And if a court ever found out there's two sets of records and only one had been produced, then you'd go to jail. 

01:17:20
UNKNOWN Well, I guess this is where, kind of ethics and things collide- 

01:17:25
STACEY LLOYD Ethics and legal. 

01:17:25
UNKNOWN They're-, There's this thing about, you know, we want to be honest and transparent. When I ask them on what basis- 

01:17:35
STACEY LLOYD Good question. 

01:17:40
UNKNOWN Do you decide there's high risk just so I know what you're basing it on so that- Because I was thinking well, maybe there's something I don't know even though, you know, even though we've both got the fact sheet. 

01:17:45
STACEY LLOYD Yeah, because you've only worked with this part of him as well though. 

01:17:50
UNKNOWN And they just stone facedly go, no, we're not telling you that. But we want you to disclose everything to us. That's one of the biggest dilemmas I've had in recent times. 

01:18:00
STACEY LLOYD Yeah, because it challenges everything. It challenges you as a person, as a professional. You said, am I just, what'd you say? Counseling toward something. Because unfortunately that's what they see us as half the time, airy fairy, don't know what we're doing. And we move to a regulation that's going to change a little bit. But it makes us more exposed. You know, I guess you need to-, If they, bottom line is, is it better to, you know, better of lesser evils to produce it at a time when you've got a little bit of control over, not the truth, because the truth's the truth, about how you present that information or report? As opposed to them going the legal path, getting a subpoena, I'm not saying you're voluntarily doing it anyway, and getting the whole record. I'm not saying to suppress anything, but it's, there is not great answer or outcome. So I think while you've got an opportunity to present it, that's probably better. But you don't know what you don't know. But presume it's going to be used in not the way you intended it, which is what you're worried about. 

01:19:10
UNKNOWN Well, yeah, I mean the, it was unusual for me. I found myself, before I wrote the report- 

01:19:15
STACEY LLOYD I see, you've got the report. 

01:19:15
UNKNOWN Calling both of my level-, Well, I didn't want to give them my records. And I wanted to just give them a potted version of what I thought would be most useful for the best outcome for the child. 

01:19:30
STACEY LLOYD Yeah. 

01:19:30
UNKNOWN Given that, you know, that was our common interest on a certain level. But it was more this thing, I found myself calling both my levels of supervision and just getting-. I wasn't just being who I usually am, which is well, this is my truth and this is what I think. It was like that part of me that's going, Oh, this is the big ogre that's going to come and get me if I actually tell the truth here, you know? 

01:19:50
Green Light PERSONAL information CAN be shared under the following circumstances: with written consent OR To avert or minimize imminent danger to the health or safety of any person OR To report a child who might need protection under the Child Protection Act OR By Order of the Court OR To cooperate with a police and/or child welfare investigation 

01:19:50
Green Light Generally HEALTH information CAN be shared in the situation: With written consent OR To avert or minimize imminent danger to the health or safety of any person OR To report a child who might need protection under the Child Protection Act OR By Order of the Court OR To a person who is responsible for providing continuing treatment and care to the individual (need not be a formal health services provider) 

01:19:50
Yellow Light In the following circumstances obtain more information and/or get advice from a supervisor, consultant or lawyer: Consent is not provided or refused but there may be a harm or safety issue for any individual or groups OR To report criminal activity to police OR Where there is a demand or request to produce information for a legal proceeding (under subpoena) OR When a professional code of ethics may limit disclosure 

01:19:50
Red Light Information can NEVER be shared if there is: a legislative requirement barring disclosure OR No consent and no need to know nor overriding health/safety concerns OR Consent but no need to know nor overriding health/safety concerns 

01:19:50
Therapeutic boundaries Boundaries are a crucial aspect of any effective client-therapist relationship. They set the structure for the relationship and provide a consistent framework for the therapeutic process. Boundaries are "mutually understood, unspoken, physical and emotional limits of the relationship between the trusting patient and the caring physician or provider" (Farber 1997) 

01:19:50
Ethical dilemmas ethics is a perspective of how we want to treat We require space for clinical retention, transparency and accountability DILEMMAS ARE DILEMMAS BECAUSE MORE THAN ONE SOLUTION EXISTS Resolution of ethical dilemmas involve practical references 

01:19:50
What is my personal position on the issue? How and when did I develop the vision? Are my values open for review and/or modification? Am I open to be challenged by other (i.e. supervisor) Do I feel openly committed to my values but my client might not accept them? And I won't be able to work with them? Under what circumstances would I adjust my values? How can I communicate my values wheel without imposing them on others? 

01:19:50
A model for ethical decision making Stage 1: Creating ethical sensitivity Identify ethical issues arising from counseling work Read ethical codes and related literature Explore value issues arising from counseling work Clarify and confront one's core values Stage 2: Formulating a model course of action Identify the problem or dilemma Gather as much information as possible about the situation Clarify whether the problem is legal, ethical or professional Look at the problem from many different perspectives as possible Include your client in the process 

01:19:55
STACEY LLOYD No. It's the process that causes that uncertainty. And you know, that whole thing you just said about the two levels of supervision. That's exactly what I would do anyway, not just with court but with anything that I needed to share. Because of course your supervisor is legally responsible for you as well. I'm glad you provided the report. I didn't know that. The other couple of things. Don't worry about age appropriate language. It's something I didn't take off when I'd done something else. Confidentiality, consent and privacy are three different things. Okay? We've talked a little about legal and ethical bases of confidentiality. We know that there's limits to that. Consent is usually always informed consent. But we do have parental consent. And we do have consent when it comes to minors. So that age of consent for minors is 16. There's some variation depending on who you talk to around the 14 to 16 age group. Obviously 18's the legal age that just adds another level in it. So depending on developmental capacity, some 14 year olds do, have capacity to give consent, which means that they don't need to have a parent attend. And you don't need to provide your record or any information to a parent once they're definitely 16. Okay? I'm not sure as a parent how I feel about that. But it's there. Boundaries. They're important. There's a few more slides. So if you want to email me I can send you the whole thing. It's no problem. Boundaries is there twice because it's probably doubly important. Dual relationships. Isn't it funny? You can proof and proof and proof this stuff and it's only when you see it up there it, at how big that is, all these little issues. Dual relationships are there. Relationships that you have with someone in one or more capacities. We had that earlier. And in a smaller town they're very difficult to avoid. But it doesn't mean they're unethical. Depends how you conduct yourself. But the example I gave you about the supervisee that was, you know, friends with and working with and counseling a couple who were knowingly having an affair and one not knowing. Not a good dual relationship. If it triangulates that's a good sign that there's a problem. Disclosure. There's all types of disclosure, mandated, compelled by law, discretionary and privileged. In Queensland we're not mandated to disclose or report any type of child abuse. But I would argue that duty of care kicks in above that, and we should be, you know, in case. That's where law and ethics combine, uh, collide. Law says you don't have to manage a report. But ethics would say there's a duty of care. If in doubt, report. Compelled by law would be a subpoena. Discretionary would be if you provided a report as opposed to your notes. You're not keeping stuff out, but you're giving a synopsis or a summary. That's fine. And privileged. Counselors don't have privilege unless they're practicing, like I do, as a family dispute resolution practitioner. So if you're qualified and registered to work within the family court, we have the same privilege as lawyers. There is no disclosure. You can't be subpoened. You can just do work without any, no, I can't say without any drama. High conflict. You just do your work. You don't have to worry about those legal, but you still do have to manage your report. Professional development and best practice. So professional development goes into training standards. There has been a bit of a push lately in the industry to peck for a probably little bit more at a different place to develop not only criteria as to how many points you need to have and where you need to have it for professional development. But training standards as to what qualifications cut the mustard and what don't. So there's this big, over the next couple of years, as we head towards trying to get government regulation a little more, there's more of a push for training standards. Not quite sure where the ACA are on that. And supervision is obviously something that has changed dramatically in the landscape over the last 12 months. So ACA, PACFA, you have to have an ACA or a PACFA registered supervisor, you know? The days of having a forensic psychologist or a lawyer or whoever it is where you're working in those areas are kind of gone. You can have it, but you can't claim the points. So just be mindful that it's not just I find it an interesting system. It is a little limited, but you do have to have someone who's ACA approved or PACFA approved. That comes into training standards too, the supervision training standards. Does anyone else supervise? You supervise? You supervise, yeah? You supervise too? Yeah. Yeah. Now the next two slides because we need to finish. I'm just going to-, we all get a bit confused sometimes or unsure. And black and white can be useful when it comes to what information do we disclose When and how? So if you email me, I'll give you these. What I've done is I've divided things into green light, yellow light, red light. So green light is things that we can share under what condition? Yellow light is where we need to get information. We can actually consult with a solicitor, a lawyer, a supervisor, or a consultant. And then red light is we can't actually share at all. And really the only grounds that we'll see in counseling isn't the bottom two, is if there's a suppression clause to our record. And that can certainly happen in criminal court and in-, or Supreme Court, and in the family court. Yeah. There might be a thing on the front of the document that says this isn't to be released. And your records will basically get sealed. It happens in murder trials. It happens in a whole bunch of other things. So that's there for you to make it easier. And then after that, there's this little bit on contracting and therapeutic boundaries. And we did cover some of that. And then ethical dilemmas, which we did cover as well. The other thing I've done I like little lists. Uhm, is I've written some questions there that may or may not be useful for you if you feel like you're in an ethical dilemma, just as-, it's like a reflective process I guess, just asking yourself where you're at and what you're doing before you actually have a panic attack and meltdown and think you're unethical. And you're not, maybe not be kind of fickle. It may be useful. It may not. Uhm,- and then I've put, because it's probably what I enjoy the most, a model for ethical decision making so it's a four step model that you too can work through if you want to do it as a reflective process. So that's all I've got for today. But I'm happy to talk to you. I'll be around the rest of the day if you want to. If you, I'll just-, Oh sorry. Which slide were you on? That one? Sorry. That's all right. Is it good? Yeah? There's my contact details if you want to send me an email. Yeah, I do. Yeah. That'd be great. I do. So thank you. I hope it was meaningful. I mean I completely changed what I was going to do, depending on the size of the group. But as I said, ethics is something that I quite enjoy. And I've done stuff. And learned the hard way as well. Not with intents of being bad and punished and stuff. But feel free to email me and I'm happy to-, the more people you kind of know, you know and consult with and work with the better it is for everybody. So thanks. I hope it was meaningful for you. I've got some cards.
