The Evolution of Psychotherapy A Conference 

00:00:19
Guiding Associations Jeffrey K. Zeig, Ph.D. 

00:00:19
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Well, Carol, you volunteered because of this problem that you have. You're kind of hiding even now. Please tell me what is it that you need to accomplish? 

00:00:49
CAROL I, I'm not quite sure what I need to accomplish, but I'm gonna be presenting next year, and that makes me very nervous, at a conference. And, um. 

00:00:59
JEFFREY ZEIG And it's a conference overseas. 

00:00:59
CAROL Yes. And that in itself makes me very anxious. 

00:01:04
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:01:04
CAROL Um, and I'm always hiding. I'm always have to hide, cuz I'm so ashamed of my nails. It's a habit I've been attempting for years to give it up. It represents something, and I keep on working on it. And I don't know where to go with it. 

00:01:24
JEFFREY ZEIG How have you worked on it? 

00:01:24
CAROL Um. 

00:01:24
JEFFREY ZEIG Have you had therapy? 

00:01:29
CAROL I did some EMDR on it. 

00:01:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:01:29
CAROL A little bit. And, uh, I have had therapy umpteen years. I did Gestalt work. But this is like the last thing in my life to make me totally what I would call whole and normal. 

00:01:49
JEFFREY ZEIG Then you'd be in trouble, uh, because you cure this one, and you wouldn't have any excuse. 

00:01:59
CAROL Right. 

00:01:59
JEFFREY ZEIG You would be stuck. You'd have to live happily ever after. 

00:01:59
CAROL Right. I'd be very productive and write or whatever. I'd help other people and. 

00:02:09
JEFFREY ZEIG And yet your sense is that you've been hanging on. You've been hanging on to this. 

00:02:19
CAROL Uh-huh. It annoys the hell out of me. It's like the last thing that is preventing me from moving forward, and it drives me, it's keeping me, driving me crazy. And I'm thinking, "Well, it's my way. My mother's way of really haunting me still or my way of holding on to my mother's introject(ph)." 

00:02:34
JEFFREY ZEIG And how do you mean that? 

00:02:39
CAROL Um, like I can torture myself. Can make myself go crazy with some fault that I have. And feel really ashamed and feel very scared. Um, just feel ashamed all of the time. 

00:03:04
JEFFREY ZEIG What is the longest in your adult life that you've grown your nails? 

00:03:09
CAROL I can't remember. A couple of years ago. I don't remember what was happening then either. 

00:03:19
JEFFREY ZEIG Excuse me. And you grew them well. 

00:03:19
CAROL It was normal. 

00:03:24
JEFFREY ZEIG And how long did you? 

00:03:24
CAROL Felt like a lady. 

00:03:29
JEFFREY ZEIG And how long did you keep them long? 

00:03:29
CAROL About two years. Three years. At various periods of my life, I did. 

00:03:34
JEFFREY ZEIG Let's, uh, take it from the other side for a minute. Let's say that there's a pleasure, and that there's some intrinsic pleasure that you've gotten that. 

00:03:44
CAROL Not pleasurable. 

00:03:44
JEFFREY ZEIG Not pleasurable? 

00:03:49
CAROL No. 

00:03:49
JEFFREY ZEIG Let's say that there is. What could be the pleasure of, how do you do this? Do you, how have you bitten your nails? 

00:03:54
CAROL This. Tearing them. 

00:03:59
JEFFREY ZEIG Tearing them, not biting them. 

00:03:59
CAROL Sometimes I tear at them, biting them. 

00:04:04
JEFFREY ZEIG And what has been the pleasure? 

00:04:09
CAROL I think it relieves my anxiety. I have enormous scare, like, uh, an underground waterfall. Not water, an underground brook. 

00:04:19
JEFFREY ZEIG And, some part of you has thought that in some way perhaps that temporarily. 

00:04:29
CAROL It relieves that brook. 

00:04:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Quells that brook. 

00:04:29
CAROL Yeah. It's like not a, a low level brook, like a brook that moves fast. 

00:04:39
JEFFREY ZEIG And, then. 

00:04:44
CAROL I've learned to hide very well, so most people don't even notice it. 

00:04:54
[sil.] 

00:04:54
CAROL But I know. 

00:04:59
JEFFREY ZEIG Do you think that in this tearing that there's been anything pleasurable in the mechanical act of tearing? 

00:05:09
CAROL Not that I'm aware of. I mean, probably tearing makes me feel good. I would wanna tear at a lot of people. And that's a real no-no. 

00:05:24
JEFFREY ZEIG In what sense? 

00:05:24
CAROL Well, it's not nice to be mean. I have to be nice. Not I have to be nice. I wanna be nice. I like being nice, and I like liking people. But, like, loving people, so. There's this part of me that wants to tear, is not good for me. 

00:05:44
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Then you were talking about this presentation in Vienna. And why is it so important. When is the presentation in Vienna? 

00:05:59
CAROL July. 

00:05:59
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And, and that gives you plenty of time. And why is it so important there that by that time, you have this cured? 

00:06:19
[sil.] 

00:06:19
CAROL Um, I feel very panicky now. Um. 

00:06:39
JEFFREY ZEIG You think forward about July and Vienna, and then you start. 

00:06:44
CAROL No, I didn't think. 

00:06:49
JEFFREY ZEIG Rather than being quiet, you're good at hiding that panicky too, cuz I wouldn't have, uh, really seen it. 

00:06:54
CAROL I play hard at being not crazy. Um. it represents completion and being victorious over, um, over, um, I discovered that I started biting my nails during the war, you know, when we left, left Europe. I'm a holocaust survivor. And, um, I discovered that that's when it started, during the war and the bombs were falling. There was a lot of terror. And I relived that terror last year. And ever since then, I think the nail biting has really gone out of hand. 

00:07:29
JEFFREY ZEIG I see. It was what? I didn't hear you. 

00:07:34
CAROL Last year. 

00:07:34
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:07:39
CAROL I relived it because I went to Holland and I saw the, uh, Anne Frank museum. And, uh, in the afternoon I went to the Keukenhof Gardens, and, and perspired. Um, um, and then they, they. 

00:07:59
JEFFREY ZEIG Good for you. Good for you for making yourself more comfortable. 

00:07:59
CAROL Um, and they stole my passport and my tickets and my airline tickets and my money and I had trouble getting it back. And I, uh, sort of, went into a real anxiety panic attack, and I kind of lived out what I experienced when I was young. And I, I, I relived the sobbing and the terror, so I realized what my parents went through. And I had a lot of forgiveness for them for the hard time they had because they had trouble getting passports and getting out. And going to Vienna is, is also a place, um, where my family, you know, went to Auschwitz and all that. So, all of that's combined, so by not biting my nails, it represents, like, conquering. Conquering something. Conquering. You know, conquering comes up for me. And, and if I don't accomplish it, I will fail and I will be, um, I don't know. Maybe I'll end up in Auschwitz or something like that. Maybe there'll be a, I don't know. 

00:09:14
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, I, uh, have a cure for your. 

00:09:19
CAROL Yeah. Don't go. 

00:09:24
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, now. I, I have a guaranteed cure. Something that will undoubtedly, um, put it, put you in a situation where you will not want to tear at your nails. 

00:09:44
CAROL That sounds great. 

00:09:44
JEFFREY ZEIG I, I'll tell you about it shortly, but first of all, you're, there's three parts as I hear what you're saying. And because you're very intelligent and insightful person, let's just talk about it directly for a minute. There's this underground brook which you've been dealing with during your life. 

00:10:09
CAROL Right. Always. 

00:10:09
JEFFREY ZEIG And, that's something that we could work on. There's the tearing that you've been doing, and that's something we could work on. And then there's this, uh, tendency that you have to have big feelings. And that's something that we could be working on. 

00:10:34
CAROL Sounds great. 

00:10:34
JEFFREY ZEIG So, somehow though, those other two pieces, the underground brook and the big feelings. Those, uh, tie in in your mind to the tearing that you've been doing. I'm asking. 

00:10:49
CAROL Yeah, because it's so intense. 

00:10:54
JEFFREY ZEIG What, what's so intense? 

00:10:54
CAROL Whatever feeling I have is so intense, so one of the ways I could control my intensity is by doing this. Tearing and whatever. 

00:11:04
JEFFREY ZEIG Look, what are you doing right now, because this is an intense situation where in a, a usual, perhaps awkward situation, how are you controlling these intense feelings now? 

00:11:19
CAROL Actually, I put a bubble around us. 

00:11:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Fabulous. 

00:11:29
CAROL A little room,and nobody else is here except you and I. 

00:11:34
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:11:34
CAROL That's nice. I feel good about that. 

00:11:39
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Very intelligent. 

00:11:39
CAROL Kind of a little sanctuary that we're in. 

00:11:44
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, well, okay. uh, but I just want to get a little more sense of this, that when you conquer this nail biting, which is a remnant from t hose early days of Europ. 

00:12:14
CAROL Mm-hmm. Definitely. 

00:12:19
JEFFREY ZEIG When an intelligent little girl didn't know what to do, what could have been a tremendous intensity or feeling. When she, uh, hooked onto that idea of this tearing, right? And you've carried that into your adult life. 

00:12:39
CAROL And it's obsolete. That's the whole problem. It annoys the hell out of me. 

00:12:39
JEFFREY ZEIG Absolutely. Yeah, but thank, thank God for obsolete problems. Because if patients didn't have obsolete problems that they brought into the present, you and I would have to do honest work for a living. 

00:12:54
CAROL You're right. That's true. But it's still an interruption. It really is a big interruption in our lives. 

00:13:04
JEFFREY ZEIG And a drag that you have to sit on your hands and find awkward postures. 

00:13:09
CAROL And not always being hiding. Like a piece of me that always has to hide. 

00:13:19
[sil.] 

00:13:19
CAROL That's what we always did. That's what I always did. 

00:13:34
JEFFREY ZEIG What's your sense of how you should get over this? Is the, the tearing something that you should get over slowly and gradually or is it something that you should get over suddenly and all of that? 

00:13:44
CAROL Fast. Give it all up fast. 

00:13:49
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Would it be. 

00:13:49
CAROL And make like a dive into a new system. 

00:13:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. But it would be a nice sense of pride. 

00:13:59
CAROL Oh, heaven. Like heaven on earth. 

00:14:04
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And, uh, perhaps it would be okay though if it was something that you got over gradually. You know, it's, it's a little strange. You, uh, and maybe an analogy is another habit like over eating. That if you overeat here, you wind up paying for it. But you paid for it here much later, and you don't pay for it immediately, because you have the opportunity to have the immediate reward, the satisfaction of overeating. But you have to pay for it later when you look in the mirror or put on your clothes the next day or weeks later. And it makes it hard to stop the habit, cuz the payment is, uh, somewhat divorced from the problem. 

00:14:59
CAROL Well, I have had that too. 

00:15:04
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, cuz I think there's something about that too. Because then you might have that immediate relief, a little bit of that brook. But then you wind up paying later. And, uh, I would suggest that, in line a little bit with what I was talking about before, a sort of guaranteed cure, that one of the things that we could do is that we could change the distance so that there could be a payment that was more approximate to the tearing. What I'm thinking about is this, that there's a few ways of modifying behavior. You can modify with reward, with punishment, and with ignoring it, not reinforcement. Somehow the problem for you has become sort of crystalized over time. It's become congealed. And like diamond it's become very hard. And then if we can apply something, a little technique, then it, on the right facet, then it can break, uh, through, and you can be free. But there, but, maybe something to change first is your impatience. You're so impatient to have this done right now. 

00:16:29
CAROL Yeah, that would be like a dream come true. 

00:16:34
JEFFREY ZEIG And, that, uh-huh. And that what I, uh, might suggest to you is that we have, uh, something that helps you to change a little more gradually. Now, before we get to that, I'd like you to think in another way. Let's say that I ask you for five intelligent excuses. Excuses befitting Carol. Five intelligent excuses to tear one bit of one nail. And it's not only tearing your nails, it's been, scary, huh? I started to move forward and you were shrinking back. Um, if, uh, five intelligent excuses to have one tear. It's not only the nail, you'd be pushing at the cuticle too. True? Because your nail has, uh, when I glanced at it before, it looked like you were doing something to damage them. 

00:17:34
CAROL Yeah, well I push them down to get them to be longer. 

00:17:34
JEFFREY ZEIG Which was doing something about destroying some of the nail forming tissue, cuz then you had some ridges in your nail. Right? Okay. So, what would be an four or five intelligent excuses befitting your intelligence to have one tear of one nail? What would you say inside your head to give you a justification for doing that? 

00:17:59
CAROL Not enough. 

00:17:59
JEFFREY ZEIG Not enough what? 

00:18:04
CAROL Not enough tearing. 

00:18:04
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh. Okay. What would be another excuse? 

00:18:09
CAROL I don't understand what you mean by that. 

00:18:14
JEFFREY ZEIG How, how would you justify it? Let's say, uh, what, this is how I'm thinking. You were free for two years. Two years you were a lady. If you did something about this problem. And then after two years somehow you. 

00:18:24
CAROL I lost it. 

00:18:29
JEFFREY ZEIG You gave. 

00:18:29
CAROL My life was getting too good. 

00:18:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so would that be an excuse that you would use for tearing? My life is getting too good? 

00:18:34
CAROL Mm-hmm. Oh, I see what you're saying. 

00:18:39
JEFFREY ZEIG Cuz, I want, want to be sure that, that. 

00:18:44
CAROL My life is getting really good. 

00:18:44
JEFFREY ZEIG And how would that be an excuse for tearing? Let's just take it at face value that. 

00:18:54
CAROL I shouldn't have such a good life. I shouldn't have such a good life. 

00:18:59
JEFFREY ZEIG Kinahora? 

00:18:59
CAROL Yeah. Yes. A good life. 

00:19:04
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Okay. Give me another excuse. 

00:19:09
CAROL It, it keeps me from moving forward. It keeps me down. God forbid I should be totally successful. Have 100 percent. 

00:19:24
JEFFREY ZEIG Kinahora. Okay. What else. Give me another excuse. 

00:19:29
CAROL God forbid I should be too sexy or feminine. 

00:19:39
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:19:39
CAROL My mother would really be mad. Um. 

00:19:49
JEFFREY ZEIG So this has been something to keep you humble? Doesn't allow you to excel. 

00:19:54
CAROL That's a good word. Keep me humble. Wow. Keep me, keep me down. Keep me humble. 

00:20:04
JEFFREY ZEIG All right. Let's do something really quick, because you've got some, uh, experience of doing some Gestalt therapy. And would it be okay to play this out for a minute as a part? Would that be all right? 

00:20:14
CAROL Mm-hmm. 

00:20:19
JEFFREY ZEIG We have this extra chair here, we'll use it. Okay. Let's say that we, uh, put Carol's nails here. And we put the tearer there. This is the part of you that tears at you. Okay? What I'd like you to do is to switch. Come around. Over here, sit here. Be the tearer. Exaggerate, exaggerate that position, and, uh, I'm going to tear at you. I'm going to tear your nails. I'm going to kee you humble. Whoops. Are you sure you want her that close? 

00:20:49
CAROL Yeah. I wanna tear her up. 

00:20:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Let's move closer. 

00:20:54
CAROL I wanna tear at you till, till you, you know I really wanna tear at you. You have absolutely no right to, to be big in this world, to, to do something important. You, you, I'm gonna stop you. You have no right to be that feminine. 

00:21:19
[sil.] 

00:21:19
JEFFREY ZEIG Can you exaggerate? 

00:21:24
CAROL I'm gonna tear you down. I'm gonna tear you down. 

00:21:24
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:21:24
CAROL I'm gonna tear you down. 

00:21:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Stop. Switch. Come over here. Be Carol. Respond to her. Sit. 

00:21:49
[sil.] 

00:21:49
JEFFREY ZEIG She says, "I'm gonna tear you down." 

00:21:54
CAROL You are not gonna tear me down. You are not. I'm gonna fight you all the way. 

00:21:59
CAROL Can you straighten up as you say that? 

00:22:04
CAROL I wanna beat this part up, you know. I'm gonna fight you all the way. You're not gonna get at me. You are not gonna get at me. 

00:22:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Once again. Louder. 

00:22:14
CAROL You are not gonna get at me. 

00:22:14
JEFFREY ZEIG Wouldn't you. 

00:22:19
CAROL You're gonna try and tray and tray and try. You're gonna tear me down, tear me down. You're not gonna get there. 

00:22:24
JEFFREY ZEIG What's your original language when you were growing up? 

00:22:29
CAROL French. 

00:22:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Say it in French. 

00:22:29
CAROL (inaudible) 

00:22:34
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Please. 

00:22:39
CAROL (inaudible) I don't know how to say the right thing. 

00:22:49
JEFFREY ZEIG You've got the feeling. That was what was important. Come back over here. She said, "I'm not gonna let you." What's your response? 

00:23:04
CAROL (inaudible) 

00:23:09
JEFFREY ZEIG In English? 

00:23:14
CAROL (inaudible) 

00:23:19
JEFFREY ZEIG And tell me in English. What are you saying to her? 

00:23:34
CAROL You can't do what you want. 

00:23:39
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm gonna keep tearing you down. Well, help her. Fill, fill in this. I'm gonna keep on tearing you down until. 

00:23:49
CAROL Je vais. 

00:23:49
JEFFREY ZEIG No, in English, please now. 

00:23:49
CAROL It's harder in English. 

00:23:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm. 

00:23:54
CAROL I'm gonna continue tearing you down till you give up. 

00:24:04
JEFFREY ZEIG Try it again. I'm gonna keep on tearing you down until. See what else comes up. 

00:24:14
CAROL I'm gonna keep on tearing. I'm gonna keep on tearing you down until you, I don't wanna say the word. Until you die. Keep on tearing you down until you're dead. 

00:24:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Please come back to Carol. What's your response to her? 

00:24:44
CAROL You never give up. Never give up. You're not gonna win. You're not gonna win. You're gonna try to tear me up and tear me up. You are not gonna win, and you're always on my back, and you've been battling with me all the time, and you're not gonna win. 

00:25:04
JEFFREY ZEIG That could be said again in French. You're not going to win. Okay. 

00:25:19
CAROL (inaudible) I don't know how to say when. Jevais, jevais, jevais. 

00:25:24
JEFFREY ZEIG (inaudible) 

00:25:34
CAROL (inaudible) That's right. 

00:25:39
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, Carol. Do something. Please come and stand over there for a minute. Stand up. And, and, get, think about these two being Carol, the therapist. And think about these two parts for a minute, and then tell me how would you apportion the energy? If there was 100 percent energy, would it be 60/40 or 70/30 or 50/50? How would you apportion the energy between these two? 

00:26:09
CAROL This is not that loud. This is much louder. 

00:26:19
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. So what, give me a numerical ranking. How would you apportion the energy? 

00:26:29
[sil.] 

00:26:29
CAROL 90/10. 

00:26:34
JEFFREY ZEIG Please come sit back here. Okay. Let's take her away for a minute. 

00:26:44
CAROL But she's, she's really getting to me now because it's 90/10. She's gonna like Custer's last stand. 

00:26:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Do you, do you mind if I move her or do you wanna have that honor yourself. Okay. What's your sense? When I, I was listening, I was, uh, thinking about Shakespeare. That this part was sound and fury. Well, uh. 

00:27:19
CAROL Sound and fury cuz it's loxing the battle. 

00:27:24
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:27:24
CAROL Losing the battle. 

00:27:29
JEFFREY ZEIG Let's, let's think for a second, you and I. Uh, as a creative way. 

00:27:34
CAROL Yeah. 

00:27:34
JEFFREY ZEIG And, you and I do some thinking. Let's say that in five months or five years or whenever, that 10 percent evolves, and somehow she matures and grows and expands into something else. What would you imagine her evolving into? Temporarily turned her away. Nice to get some feedback. Um, we just turned her away. 

00:28:09
CAROL Whistle. The whistle. 

00:28:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:28:09
CAROL That whistle. 

00:28:14
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. What could she, what could you imagine yourself. Use that creativity. You know, the art of you that created the bubble. And how could you imagine her evolving into something useful? 

00:28:29
[sil.] 

00:28:29
CAROL I had a funny fantasy at the sound and fury. 

00:28:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes? 

00:28:54
CAROL That there was a parade. 

00:28:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:28:54
CAROL A parade, like, you know, those Fifth Avenue parades that they have. And at the parade, they were all banging drums and singing. As I go to Vienna. And, um, I'm being a conductor in Vienna. 

00:29:14
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Being a conductor? Yeah. I like that image. 

00:29:19
CAROL Being a conductor in Vienna. 

00:29:19
JEFFREY ZEIG And, to the, just to make things a little shorter, help me and tell me if I understand. Could we know that she, that 10 percent was making herself known by virtue of you tearing? Too much positive feedback is not a good thing. Um, could could we, um, say that a behavioral indication that that 10 percent came up was that when you started tearing, that would be an indicator that she was there. 

00:30:04
CAROL Oh, no question. You're right. I've got you. 

00:30:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And that somehow at that moment you'd want to assert your 90 percent, and you'd also want to be thinking that somehow she could be evolving into a sort of a potent conductor. But that right now, as something temporary we might need something to help you so that there's a little artificial thermostat that prevented you from peaking too much, going too far with the emotion. And I'm going to come back to that, and I'm going to come back to that in terms of this guaranteed cure as a little bit of a palliative measure to help you. But I had another thought about it. 

00:30:54
CAROL Wait. I love that sound and fury. I think that's the greatest. 

00:30:59
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, I have another image if you like. 

00:31:04
CAROL Wow. That's so wonderful, because that's really a sound and fury, you know. I'm part of a tearer(ph) from Auschwitz. Lot of fury and sound. I love that. 

00:31:14
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, I had, had another though, and maybe I could ask the audience to help us on this a little bit. Because, uh, not only did I have an image of sound and fury, but I was thinking of my daughter. And, uh, I was thinking about a little children's song. And it went, it has to be done with the graphic, right. It goes, uh, little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest. Scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head. Down came the good fairy, and she said, "Little bunny foo foo, I don't wanna see you scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head. This is your first warning. You have three warnings, and if you don't attend, I'm going to turn you into a goon." 

00:32:09
CAROL Into a who? 

00:32:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Goon. The next day, Little bunny foo foo, hoping through the forest, scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head. Down came the good fairy and she said, "Little bunny foo foo, I don't want to see you scooping up those field mice and bopping them on the head." But, the next day, same thing. Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest, scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head. The good fairy comes down and says, "Little bunny foo foo, I've given you three warnings." Poof, wrong direction, poof. You're a goon. And the moral of the story? Hare today. Goon tomorrow. So, I, I had the thought that somehow I would conscript you, and you would help us for a minute, right? You've got the words, right? And so my thought was that when, uh, you started to know that she was coming up, and that 10 percent was sneaking out and asserting herself, right. And she's, excuse me, she started to tear, that somehow there could be a, this little hallucination. Like this idea of sound and fury. Or maybe this little song of, uh, little bunny foo foo, right? Could you sort of turn to them. Turn with me, right. They're going to help as a sort of Greek chorus, right. 

00:33:54
CAROL Uh-huh. Make it louder than that sound and fury negative. 

00:33:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. So, you're gonna hear them, right? I'd like you to just memorize it. So at that moment, you could, uh, remember their song. 

00:34:09
CAROL The Greek chorus. 

00:34:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, uh-huh. 

00:34:09
CAROL A supportive group. 

00:34:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Ready? Okay? One, two, three. Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head. Down came the good fairy, and she said, "Little bunny foo foo, I don't wanna see you scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head. Yeah. 

00:34:44
CAROL Oh, that's so funny. 

00:34:49
JEFFREY ZEIG And, uh, to me, she was like a little bunny foo foo. Right? All right. So, now, uh, to this guaranteed cure and while this Little bunny foo foo is evolving into the conductor and will have a function that you and I don't know exactly what that will be like yet, that I was thinking of this guaranteed cure as this palliative measure in between. Um, I think that you should be entitled to, uh, a severe therapy. Because it's been a severe and chronic problem, and it's been something that you've been ashamed of, and I think a severe problem should have a severe therapy. The therapy should be as severe as the problem, and I'm going to give you a therapy really tough, but also a therapy that gives you a little leeway. And it will be in this line of shortening the punishment. I think you should be entitled, strange as it sounds, I think you should be entitled to tear at yourself. But, it's a childish habit, and you should be entitled to pay a penalty for tearing at yourself. And I don't think you would be the right person to supply the penalty. So, I'm going to be the person who supplies the penalty for you. 

00:36:19
CAROL Uh-huh. 

00:36:19
JEFFREY ZEIG Is that all right? 

00:36:24
CAROL Sounds good to me. 

00:36:24
JEFFREY ZEIG And then, you'll be entitled to tear at your nails, but you'll also be entitled to pay immediately. All right? And, I think there should be a little leeway, because I don't know that you should just change immediately. So, the little leeway. 

00:36:44
CAROL That's such a magic. 

00:36:44
JEFFREY ZEIG You may be able to do it, uh, by virtue of some of this intra-psychic stuff that we're just doing here too. But, I want there to be something behavioral also. And, um, but I'm going to give you this little leeway, and you'll decide. We can negotiate how to use this. But you would be entitled to three tears in any given week. And those three tears would be free. Now, if you wanna negotiate that with me, I'll go up to five. But, then it stops. You're entitled to three discreet tears, and you'll know what , not two tears, right. Five tears, three tears. What should it be that you're entitled to? 

00:37:39
CAROL How about four? 

00:37:39
JEFFREY ZEIG Four. 

00:37:39
CAROL Five is too many, and three is too little. 

00:37:44
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. I'm generous. I'll negotiate this with you. Four sounds great. You're entitled to four tears. But on the fifth tear, then you have to pay a penalty. And you have to pay that penalty immediately. Now. 

00:38:04
CAROL Not running ten miles. 

00:38:04
JEFFREY ZEIG No, not running ten miles. Worse. Worse than running ten miles. 

00:38:09
CAROL Worse? 

00:38:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Uh-huh. Um, you carry a purse with you wherever you are. Okay. In the purse, I'd like you to put three envelopes. And these envelopes are to be addressed and stamped. And at all times, you carry with you these three envelopes, addressed and stamped. And in the first envelope, you put a dollar. It's a symbolic amount. As you'll see, it really doesn't matter. In the second envelope, you put five dollars. Again, it's a symbolic amount. It really doesn't matter. In the third envelope you put ten dollars. And then for the first infraction, you're going to send the first envelope. For the second infraction, you send the second envelope. For the third infraction, you send the third envelope. So you will be entitled. 

00:39:09
CAROL To whom? 

00:39:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Wait. You will be entitled to infractions, but you will also be entitled to pay a penalty for any of the infractions. And again, this is going to just be a palliative measure. So you could do ten infractions, but then you'd have to have, you'd have to recycle the envelopes. You'd have to replace the dollar envelope, and that would come fourth. And you'd have to replace the five dollar envelope. That would come fifth. You'd have to replace the ten dollar envelope. That would come sixth. Got it? And it would be, you just keep three envelopes with you at all times. As soon as one was gone, you'd replace it with the five one dollar, five dollar or ten dollar bills, right? And stamped and addressed. And it has to be sent immediately upon any infraction. There can't be any delay. You pay the penalty immediately. Got it? Okay, now, you're gonna have to do just a little bit of research of how to address the envelope, and, uh, I think you should be able to find out pretty quickly how to address. Ready? 

00:40:19
CAROL Mm-hmm. 

00:40:19
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, do you, do you wanna brace yourself? 

00:40:19
CAROL Mm-hmm. 

00:40:19
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. I, I want you to address the envelope to the American Nazi Party. 

00:40:29
CAROL Are you crazy? 

00:40:34
JEFFREY ZEIG No. No. That's the penalty. It's a severe problem. And a severe problem deserves a severe therapy. 

00:40:44
CAROL Oh, I can't do that. 

00:40:44
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, yes you can. 

00:40:44
CAROL Give money to the Nazi party? 

00:40:49
JEFFREY ZEIG You will. 

00:40:49
CAROL You're crazy. 

00:40:49
JEFFREY ZEIG No. No. You will be entitled to that fifth tear. But if you tear that fifth time, you will send a dollar to the American Nazi Party. 

00:40:59
CAROL Let's change the negotiation to ten. 

00:41:04
JEFFREY ZEIG No, no. As I said, you're the wrong person to supply the punishment. And I'm supplying the guaranteed cure as a palliative measure until you evolve Little bunny foo foo. And why? Because I had a third image of little bunny foo foo. And why this therapy is so appropriate. And normally I wouldn't say, but because you're a therapist, and we're in a therapy situation, I, I'll tell you very clearly. Uh, my, uh, image is, is that not only she sound and fury. Not only is she little bunny foo foo, but also she's been a Nazi. You've had this little Nazi inside your head. So, the punishment is perfectly appropriate. If you're going to honor that little Nazi inside your head, then you're going to pay the American Nazi Party for any infraction. 

00:42:04
CAROL I don't get it. 

00:42:04
JEFFREY ZEIG No, you think about it. 

00:42:09
CAROL You hit something, but I'm not getting it. 

00:42:09
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, that's okay. And, you can take a little time with that one. 

00:42:14
CAROL Sort of fits somehow, but I don't know how really. I feel as if I've had a Nazi in my head, pursuing me constantly. All my life, as a matter of fact. How did you realize that? 

00:42:34
JEFFREY ZEIG You, you, you've been great. You've been very open in a difficult situation about something that's real and personal to you, and you showed it. 

00:42:49
CAROL So that's why the Nazi inside of me wanted me to die all the time. 

00:43:04
[sil.] 

00:43:04
JEFFREY ZEIG There's some very nice kinds of tears. Some of the kind of tears that just wash away old hurts. 

00:43:39
[sil.] 

00:43:39
JEFFREY ZEIG You understand this, uh, temporary, uh, assignment. And you understand that it's a severe therapy for a severe problem, and that it's palliative, because I think that you will do more growth and development work to, uh, do something about evolving that part. All right. You know, we, we don't have very much time left, but in the little bit amount of time, would it be all right if we just did a little hypnosis to consolidate some of the things that we've been dealing with? 

00:44:29
CAROL Oh, I'd like that. Yeah. 

00:44:34
JEFFREY ZEIG And, to do that, you could just make yourself comfortable. And perhaps you could just, Carol, center yourself in the chair. Let yourself be(ph). That's great, and your hands just resting down against your sides, so that you're, may I? 

00:44:54
CAROL Sure. 

00:44:54
JEFFREY ZEIG So that your elbows are, just, just take any pressure off of your shoulders, okay? And then, with your eyes closed, you can just search inside. And as you can, Carol, search inside, I'd like you to discover a certain sensation. And perhaps you may discover that certain sensation. And in a way it could be part of the bubble that you were talking about before. And maybe, as you search inside, search inside for that certain sensation, you can somehow realize that it begins to develop and that that certain sensation can evolve, and I'm giving you a difficult task, but something that you can do. And that certain sensation may evolve in the base of your feet. And that certain sensation may evolve in your legs. And you may understand it as a growing feeling. A growing feeling that you even experience, experience in your body that growing feeling. And, Carol, you may realize that feeling can develop in other ways, that certain sensation. Perhaps you may even recognize it as a strong feeling. And that strong feeling may be something that you can begin to now realize in your neck. And as it continues to evolve, you may, Carol, experience that growing strong feeling in your head. And that growing strong feeling, Carol, can continue to evolve down your arms and just like you created the bubble, you can create that growing strong feeling in your forearms. In your wrists. And perhaps there can be a rhythm to that growing strong feeling as if somehow your unconscious mind, your inner mind was a, a leader, a conductor, if you will, that was helping you to realize that growing strong feeling in ways that are convenient, in ways that are handy. That you could have it that tip of your tongue. And I don't know how your unconscious mind can evolve, Carol, that growing strong feeling. But, it's something I'd like you to be willing to explore, and to learn about how you can evolve, Carol, that growing strong feeling, here and now, there and then, again and again and again and again. As you find yourself more yourself absorbed in the evolution of that growing strong feeling, recognizing that as I've been talking with you, certain pleasant, pleasant, pleasant changes occur. There's an alteration in the rhythm of your grieving. There's that very nice fluttery feeling around your eyelids. A change in the muscle tone. Motor movements change, perhaps a sensation that you're moving your best foot forward. Perhaps a sensation that somehow you're feet are further away from your head. A sensation that somehow perhaps your left shoulder is more distant from your right shoulder. Perhaps a, a sensation as if somehow your head is a bit larger, not too large. And all along, making those adjustments that maximize your own sense, Carol, of comfort and the evolution of Carol, that growing strong Carol. Feel it, and the[00:5230] sense of a weight that you may realize in your hands and your arms can be so interesting. And all along, you're learning about some of your own capacity to help yourself enjoy the flow enjoy the flow deep inside, that underground flow of those evolving growing strong sensations. And I'd like you to take some time to really remember in your own way, in your own language that growing strong, Carol, feeling. Evolving as you can. 

00:53:34
[sil.] 

00:53:34
JEFFREY ZEIG And then I'd like you, Carol, to begin to reorient yourself, reorient yourself comfortably and easily. Reorient yourself freely and completely, and bring yourself back fully here, now here fully. Completely Carol, take one or two or three easy breaths. Take one or two or three easy breaths and then bring yourself back fully alert and wide awake. Hi, Carol. 

00:54:24
CAROL Hi. 

00:54:24
JEFFREY ZEIG Pleasant? 

00:54:24
CAROL Yeah, very. 

00:54:24
JEFFREY ZEIG Good. You know, um, they will give you a copy of the tape, should you want it. And that's complimentary, so that you have that to review, uh, any of this, okay? And you're set on the therapy. The three envelopes. 

00:54:39
CAROL That really is mind boggling how, how the Nazis are pursuing me to this day. It's just mind boggling. And that really was. 

00:54:49
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:54:54
CAROL Thank you so much. 

00:54:54
JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you so much. 

00:54:54
CAROL Can I give you a hug. Can I give you a hug? Can I get a hug? I gotta get rid of those Nazis.
