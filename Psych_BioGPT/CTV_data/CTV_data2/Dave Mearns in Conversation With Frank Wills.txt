UWCN University of Wales, Newport Prifysgol Cymru, Casnewydd Dave Mearns in conversation with Frank Wills a program from the School of Social Studies 

00:00:45
FRANK WILLS Hello my name is Frank Wills and I teach on the postgraduate program in counseling here at the University of Wales College, Newport. Dave Mearns and his co-author Brian Thorne published Person-Centred Counseling in Action in 1988. The time when counseling in Britain was just beginning to find it's feet, but had not yet established a British-based literature, this book had an immense impact. It has become one of the best selling books on counseling in English and enjoys massive sales throughout the whole world. The importance of the book lay in it's ability to represent the really core ideas of person-centred counseling in a vital and very reader friendly way. Person-centred counseling is of course strongly associated with Carl Rogers and it is now almost 10 years since Rogers died. It's obviously vital that any approach to counseling should continue to develop, so that you can avoid the dangers of stagnation. Dave has been a notable therapist and writer who has been able to do this as shown in his more recent books such as developing person-centred counseling and training in person-centred counseling. And indeed in the second edition of Person-Centred Counseling in Action which was published in 1999. This interview gives us the chance to go back to original ideas and gives Dave the space to describe his more recent extensions to those ideas. It is currently agreed that we can regard the interviewers a dialogue, so I was able to offer some perspectives from my own position as a cognitive therapist. Inevitably, we were able to find areas of overlap, but we were also able to identify points on which we respectfully differ. Okay so let's have a look at the video. Okay well Dave welcome to the University of Wales College, Newport. 

00:02:50
DAVE MEARNS Thank you. 

00:02:50
FRANK WILLS It really is a great pleasure to have you here and I'm looking forward to engage in a dialogue with you about our, our both current experiences in, in counseling and therapy. And one area which we were thoughts that might be useful to come out a bit is the idea of conceptualization, a term that we both use in recent, recent writings. And so can I start by asking you kind of kick off on that one. 

00:03:25
DAVE MEARNS The conceptualization in terms of how we think about the work and… 

00:03:25
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:03:25
DAVE MEARNS How theory applies to it? Alright okay. The way I've characterized theory in the person-centred approach, I've really tried to work on this because sometimes people outside the person-centred approach thinks your run miles from theory and, and even some people within person-centred therapy do run miles from theory. But essentially I think that those two rafts of theory those general theory or normative theory and those theory as it applies to the individual client idiographic theory and general theory is really, really important for, for helping us as a therapist, for helping us to broaden our imagination, broaden our conceptualization of the different kinds of clients we can meet in the different issues. And so like it's really useful that I know that in working with severely traumatized clients. Sometimes you come across a phenomenon, theoretical phenomenon that this is simultaneously the worst event in the life and also point of which they felt most alive, you know so that can be scary thing for the, the person. And it is just a useful theory for me to know not that I have been waiting for that in my client. 

00:04:40
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:04:40
DAVE MEARNS …expected to be there, but I know maybe I thought my clients say it will be. So I'm ready and I can deal with that and hear it. It's often the client talks only quietly about that and so I can be ready for that and, and here it didn't help them. So, so that's like an example of general theory that's useful. But then after a point the general theory we have to lay aside because we are right into the individual theory of the client and we find what their personality is like in terms of my configuration theory, you know we can with a client create a kind of map of the different parts of their self that won't be relevant to any other person, so those two levels of theory I think are important. 

00:05:20
FRANK WILLS Right can I, can I just ask you bit more about how that works out in, in person-centred theory because I guess what seems to me to be the really central notion that drives a lot to the conceptualization in, in person-centred you know is around the conditions of worth and the way that… 

00:05:45
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:05:45
FRANK WILLS … that works out for the, the person. 

00:05:45
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… Hmm… 

00:05:45
FRANK WILLS And so, so you know we know that there are certain types of where parents have very conditional expectations of the, the children than it has developmental consequence to do with their self-image and so forth. Umm… so, so that, that would be a general theory… 

00:06:10
DAVE MEARNS Yes. 

00:06:10
FRANK WILLS …notion as it were you know. 

00:06:10
DAVE MEARNS …that's right and the precise way in which it did work out for the individual would be the individual theory. 

00:06:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:06:15
DAVE MEARNS So it's like in, in general terms that kind of alerts us to issues and dynamics that maybe there for the person. But the precise issues and the precise dynamics would be unique. So we, we can only get at through empathy for instance with the client. So in another words yes we might expect conditions of what to be playing apart there. But what conditions of worth and what part? And, and how do that manifest us, help us all individual. I suspect that's not so different from the way other practitioners and other approaches were. 

00:06:45
FRANK WILLS Well I'm, I'm going to say something little bit about counseling and therapy in the mid, but I still like to pursue the… this little bit more so. For example you know an example that you gave in one of your books which I've heard myself many times you know, in the counseling room is some that you know the, the clients who has six grade A levels but the parent's think they should have had seven. 

00:07:15
DAVE MEARNS Yeah… um… 

00:07:20
FRANK WILLS …And so therefore you know that, you know and there is sense I can never, I can never do enough to be good enough for, for these parents as you aware. And you can see how that then may be relates into you know a lighter sense of that in the self of the person about. 

00:07:35
DAVE MEARNS Can I develop that a bit. 

00:07:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah sure. 

00:07:40
DAVE MEARNS And because and this brings in some more, more recent theory and parts of the self and configurations. What can happen in that situation, I'm thinking of an particular client of mine who, who wasn't the male child that was wanted so. The conditions for her were totally impossible, she could never be male. And so she developed a part of herself a very much reflected the conditions of worth that she was only valuable if she could be male. Or if she could do male things or if she could achieve in a male world. So she became prominent in the first division of the civil service one of the few women you know for example. But also of course was deeply unhappy and couldn't form a relationship that women who would to form. So and but it can be I think the human being can be more sophisticated that so where I have developed the theory is that for her for example there was a part of her that host the condition of worth that they really reflected that, a deeply depressed part. But, but, but also there was a part of her that objected to that a part that objected to that constraining influence. And that part host quite lot of self experiences that went the other way you know. And so what actually brought her into therapy was a dissidence between those two parts that the dissidence between them grew to an extend that she wasn't holding things together anymore. And both the parts were actually exerting an influence, one part was slashing her wrists and the other part was actually asking for help. So that's kind of the way I have come to see it, it is a bit more complicated than Rogers would have had it. Rogers wrote a kind of unitary tame of theory nowhere and more dialogical tame and, and I think we're seeing the dialogical nature of the human being more that. So I would say that person is generally not just driven by those conditions or wasn't defined by them. But often another part and other parts. 

00:09:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:09:35
DAVE MEARNS … that with a… with a different narrative and often a big part of therapy is kind of healing all the other parts or all the parts exactly, so that's a kind of we have developed it. 

00:09:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so I missed that. I'm glad you brought in the points about configurations that does seem to me one of the newer, new ideas that you have definitely helpfully added in the… But if we have the, the conditions of worth and as you say that's only one part of it. Because I guess you know different people can react in different ways. Some people will go to one down position and think they have to go round proving that they are really worth. In a, in a sort of almost you know over the top way. Whereas other people presumably would think well screw you. You know I'm going to do my own thing that in other words people can react. 

00:10:30
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:10:30
FRANK WILLS But what you are also adding in that is actually that people can have in a very different reactions within their own configuration. 

00:10:40
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, absolutely for instance say a client who really, really looked and, and I have got a call (inaudible ). It looked like he would have to commit suicide you know. And then and it was a really, really difficult time and difficult session, because this was a client with a background that was close to violence anyway. And so I mean he had all rehearsed and then in one moment in a session. He, he made just a passing reference to part of him watching himself and as soon as he said that because of the general theory I heard the part of watching. And so I focused on that and it was naturally really, really important because I suspect very often it's a part of a person that kills him. But there can be another voice there as well, so for instance with him that other voice was saying excuse the language because this is (inaudible ), you tired old lump of shit it said you know. This is always your reaction to things you know. There is never anything new, you just go into this violence against others or yourself you know. So that other voice was a part of him at that point quite a small part in terms of voice that actually as you contacted that part really, really important. So it was important in that sense that part of the him was heard(ph) to reestablish the dialogue within himself. It's a first dialogue within himself well from the point of your suicide that was less likely made in the odds… 

00:12:05
FRANK WILLS Umm… yeah… yeah. 

00:12:05
DAVE MEARNS So and that was a quite chilling experience that and research for instance just frustrating on suicide, research that shows that what is about 60% of people who survive a suicide attempt, the next day are pleased about that. And so you wonder how often does one part of a person kill him you know. 

00:12:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:12:25
DAVE MEARNS So that's not a kind of thing which I think is pretty important and pretty interesting human beings are more complicated. 

00:12:35
FRANK WILLS That's great I mean may be, may be I can say something now little bit about conceptualization in, in cognitive therapy in particular which is my own main interest. And I think we might find some, some crossovers but let's see. So I think one of the, the really big advantages of, of cognitive theory is the fact that people like Beck did so much research on things like depression and anxiety. And, and what they did that was they built these in your terms you know general theory about this is how we think, depression, anxiety or the other kind of things that have been gone into work. What, what that to me that gives is like a treasure house of ideas and a language to, to understand the, you know the, the, the what, what might be going on inside the persons you know system as it were in various ways in their behavior and the way they are thinking, in the way they are feeling so forth. And but very importantly that general conceptualization of what a depression might look like is only part of the story when we get to the individual. 

00:13:55
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:13:55
FRANK WILLS And it would definitely be a stage in, in cognitive therapy where you would and you would actually write it down. Actually you would draw up the conceptualization you know various things that, that might be going on including childhood factors the core beliefs people have had and how this feeds down into the negative thoughts that they have now and that would be individual to them. 

00:14:20
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, yeah. 

00:14:25
FRANK WILLS And if can give you an example of this as one of the newer researched areas in cognitive therapy has been to do with social anxiety, social phobia. And what seems to happen is that again talking general theory you know people have these kind of beliefs about themselves that the enact, the boring and they won't interest people and so forth. And when they actually get to be with other people they feel as intense, self-consciousness which is very disabling to them. And I have two, two clients recently in a row with this, with this difficulty. And the, the first one I felt it really acutely when he was within anyone in authority. The very subconscious and he, he said what I, what I do is I start nodding and butting. And I asked butting what you mean by that. He said well you know the boss is talking if I am good yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And then he gets out the situation and realized that he hasn't heard a single word that boss has said. And he has to go and ask what did the boss tell me, I don't know what to do. 

00:15:45
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, yeah. 

00:15:45
FRANK WILLS And so consequently you know got negative thing. So I had another very similar client almost the next week you know and I, I made the mistake of assuming that he would feel this way with his boss. And I said I was trying to be over clever I think. 

00:16:00
DAVE MEARNS Yes, yes. 

00:16:00
FRANK WILLS Suppose you feel this way that your boss is something. He said well no actually, with my boss I never feel that because you know I know what the expectations are. I know what the line of authority is and I know what I suppose to do at work. It's actually a process informal things where I just really, I've got no idea what you're suppose do then. So it was a radical example of that a general theory. 

00:16:25
DAVE MEARNS That's right… 

00:16:25
FRANK WILLS You know but needing to be individualized to, to, to people so I'm just wondering how, how that sort of… 

00:16:30
DAVE MEARNS Absolutely I mean I, I would actually think I mean although I see this is a person-centred approach theory. I think it… it's probably what we all do, you know and I just think you just feel that we have client I think it helps students this distinction that we were making between general and individual normative and the idiographic. Because, because they can even more easily have crossovers because they are naturally insecure and… and they want the general to apply more than it does. But we have to be, if we didn't think this way in our work we wouldn't be working with individuals, you know. We wouldn't work I don't think, you know if you couldn't meet that second client quite quickly after putting away the general theory, it couldn't work. 

00:17:15
FRANK WILLS I mean can, can I share with you now slightly more difficult feeling… 

00:17:20
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:17:20
FRANK WILLS …about this. And this is the fact that one of the things that you know we are talking about the politics of therapy before. One of the things that so disappoints me a bit in a way and… and you know you might be able to put me right on this. But is that as you can probably tell me, you know I think that in particular Aaron Beck's contribution was just such a masterful contribution. And I don't quite understand why other people don't want to know about that and kind of use it, you know so you know and in fact you know, I've been looking through all your books you know to… to prove myself before this interview and the first, one of first things I do is I flick through and I see if there is a reference to back and there wasn't any of your books you know. 

00:18:10
DAVE MEARNS Okay well I think that, I think… 

00:18:10
FRANK WILLS Is that, like I said(ph) unreasonable expectation of it. 

00:18:15
DAVE MEARNS No I just think it's another difference if you like is the cut, the, the kind of cut we taken in relation to theory, theory. Do we take cuts that are kind of problem centered or problem oriented? So we would have cuts with depression, cuts with anxiety or cuts with, you know schizophrenia whatever it is. And the theory we developed that way. Or, or is it the different kinds, different kinds of cuts taken. Because that's the medical model oriented way of cutting things, problem-centred. I mean there are other cuts that you can take to theory which is much more existential for instance, you know what happens when people face particular you know when people face an existential crisis. What kinds of things can arise there? And so in that for instance you could have an array of it's a theory to do with depression, to do with anxiety, to do with all sorts of different things. But there is a different kind of cut on theory. And I think traditionally and understandably in person-centred approach, we haven't taken a problem-centred cut because that drives you. It drives you far too much down the general theory applied to the individual. So I think that's been the history of course I think it has to continue being that because I do very much that could either there are real gems and what that people have done with different cuts that, that could be useful elsewhere. 

00:19:35
FRANK WILLS So if you wanted to, to you know concrete on that a bit more than so. Would, would you agree with me really I suppose? I'm asking you to is that so we might have a person, person-centred therapist who opens the work in a, you know with the… with the clients in a very sort of open way. But does actually discover that depression is a, is a significant part of this picture. 

00:20:05
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… Hmm… 

00:20:05
FRANK WILLS I mean and so that you know if I was supervising that person and you know as you know in this present day and age you do quite often have supervisor assistance(ph) with different, from different, different models. And this has happened to me that you know it would be legitimate to suggest well you know you could have a look at what backs us and that might give you some useful general ideas just to inform. 

00:20:35
DAVE MEARNS Absolutely and… and that could be really useful in the (inaudible ) and the skill of that practitioner from the other approach is to be able to distill theory and take the general from it without invading the specific, the individual. Like for instance how often depend your transactional analysis because I think it is lovely prospective from the human being and quite a, not a, not a simple one I don't mean to be critical in that way, but quite a ready language you know. And it's all often depend to that perspectives from that. Yeah, I mean all these are riches and the more crossovers we have the better, produce our own disciplines of working with them. 

00:21:15
FRANK WILLS Okay, so let… lets move just on to, I think I didn't say like that to, to perhaps another area where I think that may be cognitive therapy you know partly has learned but can still more from, from your you know from your writing certainly probably from person-centred therapy in general. And that is the whole issue of the therapy to relationship and the way you've now developed these interesting ideas about relational depth. And if I start from the, the CBT angle as it way you know, as you know CBT is fairly structured and there is a tradition which is probably going to come in more rather than less of having protocols, you know where the structure of session is actually written down beforehand. And I have to say that personally I think that I regard those as guidance were written that must have all those things. 

00:22:15
DAVE MEARNS They aren't actually copy manuals. 

00:22:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah good. So, ah… but you know the question has been properly raised I think about whether using these potentially formulaic things, you know does interfere with relationship. And another factor I would like to chuck in for and I would use, I was saying to you that in fact I was counseling last night myself and I was partly pondering some of the things that you have written about, about relational depth when I was conducting the session. And I was, I was aware of the fact that I do often take notes during the session this is a bit of thing you know, if you see backward he was always taking notes and students always think, he is taking notes he is not listening the client etcetera, etcetera. And I was partly debating on my own and I wonder if this is, you know barrier between me and this person that, you know so I'm interested to know what, what you think of all that steps. 

00:23:20
DAVE MEARNS Yes well I never think of ever taking notes, but as a matter of discipline I audio record every single session I have for the client apart from the first session. And if they agree and that's been a discipline I've had for hundreds of years. And that's part of, part of that is my record of things, part of that. As I, as I practice more it became more important for me to remember the ways my clients express things. So that I could if I was dipping back to them I could dip back to the way they express them last. Because they would have structures that would change and evolve, but what better if I met them where they were with it. So hence that discipline also found that not a lot of clients use these audiotapes which is fascinating to, you know in creating kind of meta-therapy situations or taking them home for their partner. And so, so that's kind of how I got rendered. I, I'm not sure if that actual taking of notes, although I haven't experimented with it, I'm not sure the fact actually need to get the way I could, I could envisage the situation for the client really experienced you or whoever was taking the notes. They, they are truly and they truly with them and the taking notes was just another skill you were able to do alongside I wouldn't have thought necessary. But certainly the idea of adaptive relational contact something I've really tried to focus on. I mean Rogers talked about the therapeutic conditions, the core conditions and often their approach is particularly from the outside it is seen in those terms. And so what I've been trying to do is to, is to kind of reunite those conditions. Because what he was really talking about was an incredibly powerful contact. Powerful in the sense not necessarily emotionally, but powerful in the sense of that if, if I was the client I had really be feeling you kind of so close to my experiencing that, that made it incredibly safe or much more safe for me and incredibly safe not right because what he is doing is getting over the fear, you know the fear I would have in making contact with myself as I see myself. And, and exposing that to you and to me and for the client to do that they really need to feel that I'm someone who is in the kind of with them, with their experiencing not just understanding but the act of being in their shows that I am not judging it to its enormous amount of safety for them. So that's the… the briefly that's the kind of, that's the kind of emphasis person-centred approach takes on relationship. What's important to of course is what happens when you are in there. And, and of course there is hasn't been much written about in person-centred work. But I do believe there is some from other tradition actually looked at what happened when you're in there. In there language they would see a lot of cognitive stuff happening for example and although that wouldn't be the frame. It's simply that you are in there and you're interacting with the human being as they are experiencing the world at an existential level, um… you are with them, you are close to that. You're focusing on the edges of their experience and you're reflecting their symbolizations that helps them to re-symbolize. So, so there is a lot happening that's cognitive as well, but that's, that's the start of the working that's the emphasis of the working. And I'm not sure I just can't see how you would get to that if you didn't have that depth of relational of contact. I mean this is the depth of contact as far below transference. Transference is a phenomenon. It is much more superficial relationships. Umm… the person-centred worker would be unpacking that transference, would be trying not to be blank screen. Would be in that sense getting below that level of the person's experiencing and relating in the world. So we are taking about something pretty fundamental I think. I got to that inevitably because a lot of my early work was working with people who are severely traumatized. And if you didn't get to that level with them the work didn't start, the work just didn't start. 

00:27:30
FRANK WILLS Alright okay I just refer about the idea of the protocol, I mean is that enough or not Dave. 

00:27:40
DAVE MEARNS The protocol for the session like (inaudible . Emm… well a few of us years at a international conference were saying yes we actually could draw up a manual for person-centred work. But it could be a very different kind of manual and I'm not sure we would pass the test of the manual. But it would be manual that would emphasize different things. It would very much emphasize the, the way the therapist entered the session. It would be very much emphasizing the therapist getting themselves in a good place to meet the client as an individual. It would very much be emphasizing and pay attention to what the client is saying. But more important than that pay attention to how the client is seeing it. How is the client expressing himself. Are there edges to the client's experience that they are expressing? What are these edges can you delicately kind of knock on the door in terms of these edges without invading them you know. Actually you could write, you could write particular manual on that, but it couldn't be you did this, this and this. But you would be in essence these are the kinds of things that you are aware of and, and if such and such then such and such. If better it would be a bit like sort of translating from one language to another. I'm not sure we would add very much. I don't think it would particularly help the therapist, but it would be useful in terms of the politics of the whole thing of helping other people see. 

00:29:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:29:05
DAVE MEARNS Well yes there is a system, it is a different system. 

00:29:10
FRANK WILLS And, and, I don't know whether it's a good or bad thing but they just seem to be in America you know that I think they have much more advanced you know in these areas and all source there is a I've read about… about recently a, a manual for supportive expressive therapy whatever quite that is but. 

00:29:30
DAVE MEARNS Yeah supportive, supportive counseling I think is a term I've read it for years and then I found out it was a term that psychodynamic therapist used for person-centred or something like that. 

00:29:35
FRANK WILLS Right… 

00:29:40
DAVE MEARNS Its Never ever been used it I say, because it carried (inaudible ) the external view of that relationship as being actually something superficial. It's often seen as the therapeutic alliance or something like that. But relational therapy is much different from that. 

00:29:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. It is not be like, that's all. 

00:29:50
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:29:55
FRANK WILLS Sure by the way but, you know I was reading a study of these different types of manuals. And actually one of the interesting line what you are saying, one of the main conclusions was that you know maybe we do need to have different types of manuals. 

00:30:10
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, yeah. 

00:30:10
FRANK WILLS You know which say, you know and you have… 

00:30:10
DAVE MEARNS I think that's two… 

00:30:15
FRANK WILLS …different types of things. 

00:30:15
DAVE MEARNS Probably we did different things, but that's been my impression too is that the manualization phase people are beginning to kind of see whether it goes so far, but you know we need to think a bit broader, yes I've… I've seen the, the conventional power manual approach brought into question more than used to be. I suspect be probably always a good thing in Europe for being behind America because some things you could, you don't fall into the same rules that's all. I think we can probably avoid that. 

00:30:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, okay. Um… just thinking a bit about the so called "structure of therapy" and I'm sure you're, you're trying to tell me, you don't know very much about cognitive therapy. I don't… don't how true that is but that I'm sure you know that it at least as you know quite structured and therefore is quite a minimal to these um… um, a protocol approaches, although I want to say this every time I think about that you know that I, I think people should regard them as guidelines rather than things they have to slavishly follow. Um… but one… one perception that I… I have um… about this is and if I can just say something about our, our program here. You've… you've met Mike and Norma and you will know that they, they work on the front end of the program and I traditionally worked more on the, the back end of the program. So what we've been doing is you know general counseling and, and person-centred skills at the start of the program and you know, you know offering a chance to specialize later on in the program. And I have to say that I think, I really value the fact that the students have been well grounded in person-centred of course, I think personally makes them much better cognitive therapists… 

00:32:05
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… hmm… 

00:32:10
FRANK WILLS …at, at the end of, end of the day and I had one, once when I was speaking a, a CBT conference I said I was talking about what it was like trying to get counselors who have been grounded and person-centred to umm… learn um… CBT and I somewhat jokingly I said, you know one problem I face is that, some times the students almost listen too much, you know they go, they try to go with everything that the client might say and whereas CBT would be more about listening out for the salient issues and really focusing on them. And… and somebody came on to me afterwards who um… was trainer in the health service teaching student, people to the CBT in house and she said "you know why I've got the exact opposite problem to you." 

00:33:05
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… hmm… 

00:33:05
FRANK WILLS "You know, I can't get them to listen, they're trying to CBT without listening to the clients." And I actually thought myself I'm glad. I like it my way, I like the problem my way round rather, rather than the other way, right. 

00:33:15
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:20
FRANK WILLS Um… so, so I'm wondering what's you think about um, you know what structuring therapy. And again may, may be, one justification which I sometimes make for it is the fact that you know the clients may be quite confused, they may feel quite loss and sometimes a structure can be helpful to them. I certainly had that feedback quite often from clients I have said you know it's nice… it's nice to know… 

00:33:50
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… hmm… 

00:33:55
FRANK WILLS You know, the different things that are going to come up and they find that helpful. 

00:34:00
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:34:00
FRANK WILLS I'm just… I'm just wondering whether you, whether you think there is a structure in, in that or any other sense in person-centred counseling? 

00:34:05
DAVE MEARNS Umm… I really think person-centred therapy really does take an opposite try or very different try to that. It's at, it's at that stage, by that stage we came into the idiographic, we are into what would really is for this individual. And so for instance, the issue may be absolutely nothing that we could ever have in our manual, not in our manual. But in our, you were saying umm… you use to pick on the important issues of whatever, you know quite often you would have no idea what the important issues would be a case that I just written out for a chapter in a book and person described himself as alcoholic. The real kernel issue, very much at an existential level was to do with the fact that when he was drinking, the sadness that… that gave him was living. It was the, what living one example he had of the experience of living. Now, you could never have had a frame that would go in with expecting may be to find that, that was so idiographic. In fact even explaining very detail, it's very difficult to get people to understand it, you know because you really have to be in his phenomenal world to see that for him and his world there had never actually been an experience of being alive and living. And what he got through the drink was that experience and it was because of the sadness that came. It's like you could never have got that and expected that and also to, if you were operating on other things that did seem to be important issues. It would keep you away from the idiographic that was danger of that, it may come through or it would be a danger. 

00:35:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

00:35:55
DAVE MEARNS So that's kind of how would I argue that for person-centred prospective you're really trying to open to that, that idiographic so to speak. 

00:36:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm… yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:36:05
DAVE MEARNS And that is a different kind of… 

00:36:05
FRANK WILLS I think… 

00:36:05
DAVE MEARNS But they both are clients in that situation. May be both are clients could have successful therapies, but there would be about different things. You know I'm, I'm actually… 

00:36:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:36:15
DAVE MEARNS …very much probably… 

00:36:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:36:15
DAVE MEARNS For instance, I absolutely one of the reasons I don't criticize other approaches is for two reasons. One is that I I never known of about them and the other is I firmly accept they are research finding which suggest that, you know the mainstream approaches are pretty effective and… and there's no big difference between them. I do think CBT has got a better base for research and that was not prospect, but I suspect that the more important variable is that you find a way of working that fits you and I find a way of working that fits me. We both do better our clients that way. I'm just remembering that early in my behavior as a psychologist before CBT, it was behavior therapy and I was the worst behavior therapist. I'll never forget, I… I worked with this patient and she totally overcame of fear of bridges and that such wonderful systematic desensitization program you know with those pictures of bridges was going up and looking at this bridge which was just a walkway you know. I was going 20 yards along and 50 yards and halfway and all along with me and then herself and all the stages were beautiful. We did all right when the anxiety built up a couple of times we went back few stages, it was actually wonderful. And then about six months later, she phoned me up and said, can I have another session. I said, fine come along to the office. Well, I can't really get out the house anymore. Ha…ha… symptom substitution wasn't to do with the approach. It was to do with that I was a bad behavior therapist, you know and I firmly believe that, there are very different ways of working. And rather than kind of look, rather than look to be all the same or to criticize each other, we can actually learn a lot from each other in terms of perspective. I think that's true you are talking about Beck you know that tell us was would be really useful. But we should also note our differences and then we may be working very effectively because of our different such as people. 

00:38:15
FRANK WILLS So, I can see a sort of early biography about your… autobiography of your early period. I was a behaviorist… 

00:38:25
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, it's a bad one. 

00:38:30
FRANK WILLS Okay. I wonder if I can open up with you another couple of things in a sense you will already raised them, but I'm kind of interested you know the different type of clients we get. Ah… and I particularly picked up the, the, the interest in, in the, in the new edition of the developing person-centred book. You know on the, so called "personality disorders" I think we would both share a reservation about that. But we are talking about, you know pretty disturbed clients and you gave a lot of… you and Elke gave a… 

00:39:10
DAVE MEARNS Yes. 

00:39:10
FRANK WILLS …examples in the book of that, it should… it should be very interesting. And actually CBT is also addressing those, those areas reaching the conclusion by the way that a much longer term version of therapy is needed for those clients. 

00:39:25
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… hmm… 

00:39:25
FRANK WILLS So we both learning that, and but it's particularly I'm sure, I think you know for umm… the, the person-centred model. Whether it's, it's an old area or a new area you will know of the Mendota study that Rogers was involved in working with, you know pretty institutionalized schizophrenia and so forth, you know back in the… 

00:39:55
DAVE MEARNS The Wisconsin study. 

00:39:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:39:55
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:39:55
FRANK WILLS The Wisconsin study, yeah and um… you know that I've had several different accounts of that, some of which that it show the person-centred therapy could work with those clients and some which said, it… it didn't you know, but it… it… it did seem to be something that Rogers did back… back off away from historically to me, I mean you… you probably know more of historical detail. And of course, you know one of the, we were talking about the… the extreme prejudice versions of our own models and you know one of the extreme prejudice versions of… of this would be of course, you know it's all middle class clients and you know university students, it was all Rogers work was done in that… 

00:40:40
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… 

00:40:40
FRANK WILLS context with, you obviously talking about something very different here… 

00:40:40
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… 

00:40:45
FRANK WILLS …and that also flags up for me, the issue of classes something I'd like to discuss with you because the comments you make about your own social class, but you know, but can we just stay first on the, you know the disturbed clients… 

00:40:55
DAVE MEARNS Range of clients. Yeah, yeah. I mean, some people say I'm very critical of Rogers study what can I say it's actually not true, but what I'm trying to do is to um… is to reflect on the fact that lot of this theory I think about 50 years ago and um… and we need to update that. Rogers paid a lot of attention, yeah to the therapeutic relationship. One of the things I see is that just a support does the therapeutic relationship and almost that kind of be pre-determinant of it is the therapeutic context. And I really think this is part of big thing we must be attention, particularly in working very different clients. For instance, my early therapeutic work, we would work with only three patients, but we would work everyday, six days a week. And that was in the hospital context where the rest of the regime was therapy oriented even the medication was therapy oriented. People weren't closed off, but of… the symptoms of depression maybe contained of it and things like that. Now, we would never have got any flare up with those patients. I thought if only were(ph) mute because they were traumatized. We had never got anywhere, if we're seen in end of the week fancy middleclass office, forget it, you know. And, and interestingly, a lot of these patients now a days would be deemed unsuitable for therapy and the politics of it is that, usually they're unsuitable for therapy, they're unsuitable for the therapeutic context we're able to… to offer them. So, I think that's a big variable that all our approaches, you know could use that, it's… it's… it's such an important thing like, you know if you're very cut off in one way or another whatever it is and you are only going to open odds(ph) or come step out of that or delicately feel you… you're out of that. If you feel the context that's being offered is big enough to contain, you know what we have. 

00:42:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:42:55
DAVE MEARNS So, I think that's, that's a big constraint. 

00:42:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:42:55
DAVE MEARNS It's very interesting sort of as staying went on more and more of my work and was with a… if you're using problem categories with clients who would be diagnosed certainly with personality disorder and probably not more extreme than that, but certainly varying degrees of that although, I didn't think that way. Umm… but and… and again many people would say, well they are unsuitable for therapy. But, I think, one thing that was important for me is there is a point at which the descendants within the person becomes big enough that he might under certain circumstances engage therapy. And I don't know if this makes much sense theoretically, it's like… it's like if you've got somebody who is has to developed in personality disorder in response to their circumstances etcetera, they can be so closed off in relation to other people, the therapy would never become corrected unless it was prescribed by the courts… 

00:43:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:43:55
DAVE MEARNS …which usually wouldn't work I think for any approach. And, but at other times, something has moved on like for instance one of my clients found himself crying, you know and… and this crying was different from the melancholy he would sometimes go into. This was a kind of… it was almost like in a sense part of himself was really aware of how much he had lost by the very enclosed lifestyle he had given themselves. Now that was an example of the beginning of the dissonance within him and often now if we… if we get a client at that point then we can do a lot. But we've got to watch it in our profession, because I think we only appeal to a small proportion of the population. 

00:44:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:44:40
DAVE MEARNS In general, we only really are geared up to the kind of mildly neurotic sight of the population or moderately neurotic and also to again in the politics odd, I think in general in our profession, we are on the neurotic sight, still within normal range, but we are in the neurotic cycle. 

00:44:55
FRANK WILLS Mostly. 

00:44:55
DAVE MEARNS So, it's a lot easier for us to work with even moderately or even extremely neurotic people because we've already got a flavor of it. 

00:45:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:05
DAVE MEARNS It can be very difficult for us to work with somebody on a more personality disorder at sight, even if they're nearer the normal because they… we don't have a flavor for it and we go in sort of and frightened by it. A number of the… latterly in my practice I only worked with men and that was pure accident because a number of men would be coming and would say, I think I frightened my previous therapist, you know ah… it's… it's a whole I'm think I'm skipping a lot, I probably deviated from what you're saying, but I'm quite excited about the fact that… 

00:45:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:45:35
DAVE MEARNS …in the profession… 

00:45:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:45:35
DAVE MEARNS …I think we've got lot to learn in terms of how can we make ourselves amenable to a wider range of people and problems if you like. 

00:45:45
FRANK WILLS I was just saying that, Dave about, um… the work of Larry Beutler and he someone who has um… you know looked across the different types of therapy and looked at how different therapies use different models and how clients respond to different models and one… one of his findings was that um, the… if you think of therapies as one dimension and think of them is you know from the structured end of the continuum to the less structured and… and that there are some clients really aren't… can't use structure and they maybe the more disturbed clients, I think is the idea that, I'm normally worried in my own work you know sometimes what I'm doing is CBT… which I don't do all 100% of the time, but I might suddenly feel this just isn't working with this clients and I maybe will try for a bit, but may well eventually back off and… and do something which I would see as much more like you know person-centred counseling with that… with that clients. So, I'm just wondering if that rings any bells for you in terms of you know… 

00:46:55
DAVE MEARNS Well, I supposed the bell that rings is… is of the difference because uh… my approach in that situation would be totally different in a sense that you know if I'm imagining at right, if I'm with the client and… and I sense my clients discomfort with my reflections or whatever and in that sense less structured we've gone about, it's what I was sensing that. Then… then I would… I would work with that, I would… I would go into that and my first kind of thing would be reflection on that is just difficult for you or whatever. So, we go about at that way and… and see where that went, so it's not sort of changing the way of working because it… it seems to be better fitting for the client, but working the difficulty or difference or whatever it is and seeing where that went. And, but I suppose in that situation, if… if that prove for the client to be more of the same and anxiety provoking or… or if not anxiety provoking not relevant, then they probably would not come, you know. So the client would… would make that judgment, but it would be a different initial response to it, it would be to work with it rather than to change the way of work. 

00:48:05
FRANK WILLS And how do you feel about the… the view which seems to be emerging in… in some quarters now about, you know for example in the BPS that um… I think chartered psychologists have to have two models that they… 

00:48:15
DAVE MEARNS Yes, yes. 

00:48:20
FRANK WILLS …would got(ph) to add some… 

00:48:20
DAVE MEARNS And try to improve, counseling psychologists have to be schooled in about three I think at least. 

00:48:25
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

00:48:25
DAVE MEARNS So, it's just… it's… I smile at it because it's amazing how down the year psychology and counseling school therapy have gone different directions over things. And for instance, in… in… BACP I would say the important thing, the really important thing is to be thoroughly schooled in one model. Now, if you've got time and opportunity to be thoroughly schooled in two models, fair enough and but at… at least to make sure people absolutely thoroughly grounded and schooled in one and have coherence to the functioning is, I think that's better than partially schooled in two or three um… because I think you know when we're really challenged in our work with the client, you know we have the depth the and experience and the comfort and the ease in a model, whatever the model is. I think in general we have workout better, I thought it would be my prejudice anyway. 

00:49:15
FRANK WILLS Okay. I wonder if I can um… finish on a more personal note. 

00:49:20
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… 

00:49:25
FRANK WILLS Um… and it's one… one comment, I think it was in the first edition of the Person-Centred Counseling in Action. And, and I'm aware by the way if um… you know how widely throughout the world that book is sold, I mean potentially it's in Chinese are… 

00:49:40
DAVE MEARNS Japanese and Slovakian… 

00:49:45
FRANK WILLS Um… so obviously in influential book, but one… one I suppose you know different things speak to different people, the… the line that really spoke to me in… in that book was um, I think I'm right in saying, somewhere alone like maybe in the introduction there's a comment about what are Brian Thorne's a high Anglican and Dave Mearns a working class, a Glaswegian doing on the same boat or something. 

00:50:15
DAVE MEARNS Former poacher, I think is… 

00:50:15
FRANK WILLS And, you know it sort of… and, and the reason why it raised a record for me was because I'm… I'm… I'm from relatively working class background myself and… and I have occasionally felt like you know that we are quite a middle class world in counseling. And I think, you know maybe what are… are to institutions have in common is that we… you know we… we probably both instruct light at Newport, which happens in a much more socially diverse… 

00:50:45
DAVE MEARNS Absolutely. 

00:50:45
FRANK WILLS …a group of students you know. 

00:50:45
DAVE MEARNS It's Right. 

00:50:45
FRANK WILLS So, I wonder any reflections on where that's going. 

00:50:50
DAVE MEARNS The main one is that I… I found it personally as a therapist, I'm not sure of I've really written this anywhere. When… a great strength is to be ought to be pick up the personal language of the client, you know and… and… and in terms of picking up the personal language of the working class West of Scotland, mail(ph) for instance, which is very typically a difficult one, you know but that's easy for me, you know. But I'm challenging the other ways, I maybe challenged to pick up the personal language of someone who is in very middleclass, top school or whatever it is although Brian has helped me in that regard. I see what are the strengths of that, I think of Bryan and I working together is that difference, but also because we work together for 28, 29 years something like that. We know each other so deeply, that it's a wonderful example for students of… of how you know when… when you establish a bond at some depth of knowledge of a person, then… then it's amazing how two different, you know two different people can be very much involved and very much complement each other, it's a personal of very… Brian Thorne although we are incredibly different, okay. 

00:51:55
FRANK WILLS I mean, speaking at the… the geographical thing as well… 

00:52:00
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:52:00
FRANK WILLS …the other aspect is that you know some degree counseling has been quite dominated by southeast England really in many ways in my view. 

00:52:10
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:52:10
FRANK WILLS We've certainly felt out on the fringes here in Wales at times. I think probably maybe Scotland you've got bit more of a… 

00:52:15
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:52:15
FRANK WILLS …your own supportive… 

00:52:20
DAVE MEARNS Yes… 

00:52:20
FRANK WILLS …structures? 

00:52:20
DAVE MEARNS Again it's that kind of thing as always Scotland was a bit behind in England in developing things. So, I think we were able to go in at a different stage once we did started. So for instance, we do a lot now in terms of primary care counseling in our university we have big contract with the health authority to provide counseling service in 60 general medical practices. And that for me is wonderful, that's what the whole thing is about. For me, what it's about is providing that kind of help for people free at the point of service, you know. Now we're gonna approach like that if it does get rolled out it'll be in 60 secondary schools in the Glasgow area um… for young people and… and again that's in a sense my mission although really that what(ph), but that… that's very much what I'm about, reaching everybody. It's… it's amazing to listen to tapes of a ordinary Glasgow(ph) folk and not with a well-developed language of the emotions, but actually with a very straight forward and direct language of the emotions and to hear them working in the therapy context. I'm often crying, you know to listen some of these tapes on students because you can really see the fantastic joust(ph) they can make of quite small interventions really. Um… and that makes you even more annoyed at the acculturation of the… the rather the socialization and the lack of attention to the emotional and the cognitive sight together. You know lack of attention to the old person and the way, certainly in Scotland and probably in other parts too and traditionally we've really ignored so much of a person and… and done them a great to this(ph) therapists and… and then I keep coming back to it. Actually, very little intervention can be well used by people, you know and that's been a big part of my work in Scotland is to really take that out. 

00:54:05
FRANK WILLS I think that's been a… a really important development, hasn't it, the getting counselors into health centers? 

00:54:15
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, absolutely. 

00:54:15
FRANK WILLS And um… 

00:54:15
DAVE MEARNS Sometimes local private practitioners are objecting, which is good. 

00:54:20
FRANK WILLS And, but I guess that what often goes with that though is you know shortened interventions. 

00:54:25
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:54:25
FRANK WILLS I don't know if it's the same in Scotland, but the… I think there are usually six to eight… 

00:54:30
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:35
FRANK WILLS … session caps on the number of sessions. I think counselors are quite good at finding ways round in that you know, but nonetheless. And it does raise the issue about you know about shorter-term work… 

00:54:45
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:54:45
FRANK WILLS …and how this is really looks like quite strong tied that's you know is running in… in our field. And I was interested in um… you know that the… the latest edition of the um… developing person-centred counseling that there is some discussion of shortened… 

00:55:00
DAVE MEARNS Yes. 

00:55:00
FRANK WILLS …versions of person-centered, I think Brian's… 

00:55:05
DAVE MEARNS Yes, Brian's seems(ph) to that. I think that's true, I think in the approach we had a prejudice against anything that would shorten the… the thing, but I think Brian's investigation and a number of others have actually found that we can't have… actually quite big dividends for quite short-term interventions. In terms of offering a service I'm absolutely, I wouldn't entertain a service that was time limited, but I would entertain a service that was short-term. So for instance, in our contracts with health authorities, we do not accept paying limitation, what we say is rather than… than say, you've got maximum of eight session, whatever it is, I want an average of six and I will cut it… that's much better for professionals. If you sit to the counselor, over the year, I want you to hit an average of about six. That allows them you know there… there are people who can very usefully use one or two sessions or three as other people. If you stop after six or eight, it would be ridiculous because they are just opened to the window so to speak. So, they need that 50, some need the 20, some need the 25 very few… 

00:56:10
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:10
DAVE MEARNS …but it allows the professional a bit more an attitude. What we now actually doing in our service, systematic use of core was ah… great number of our patients um… we're actually mapping out circumstances if we are particular clients can usefully use a longer-term period and we can justify that evidentially because cores are wonderful value to, outcomes(ph) evaluation for that. So, we can justify that to the authority, so that's where we're going, it's interesting, of course, it really fits the evidence based culture. So, I've… I no longer have a prejudice against short-term working, but I really like the professional to have a better levy. 

00:56:50
FRANK WILLS This solution, the averaging idea will… 

00:56:50
DAVE MEARNS Yeah. 

00:56:55
FRANK WILLS …take that one onboard. 

00:56:55
DAVE MEARNS Yeah, and when you think about it, in terms of the purchaser the… the economic unit is the average times the number of people that's actually then you know how much service they're getting, because you've to get other dimensions like hit at your one place where they stopped, they… they put a cap on it of eight and their average went up from 4.6 to 7.2, because the perception was, 18(ph). And so, a lot of people who otherwise could have make good use of a few went more towards the edge. On economic to capitalist… 

00:57:30
FRANK WILLS Okay. Well, I want to finish actually now uh… Dave, but um… I want you to… something I… I quite like to press pursue outside… outside this discussion is that I personally would like to um… capitalize a bit on… on today's meeting. I think that… I think we've exchanged a lot of interesting ideas and I suspect, you know you will feel the same, in a sense, we need to look at this (inaudible ) and see where we have got, I mean it feels like we've got somewhere, but you know, we'll… we'll see you know when we review the tape um… or… or maybe it's a better idea of where that is, but I'm… I'm quite interested in having some sort of further exchange… 

00:58:15
DAVE MEARNS Hmm… Hmm. Yeah. 

00:58:15
FRANK WILLS …between you know perhaps all students or something like that, you know where… where we could take this further because you know the CBT's action oriented as you know, we don't had to be able just about talk, but thank you very much. 

00:58:25
DAVE MEARNS And also judging by yourselves CBT is also very warm and engaging. 

00:58:30
FRANK WILLS Thank you… thank you(ph). It's a good point to finish off, I must appreciate this.

The school of health and social sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice, we give critiques of the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples, in an informative, but light-hearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series, in common with all the material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you're a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we'll have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we've got to offer.
