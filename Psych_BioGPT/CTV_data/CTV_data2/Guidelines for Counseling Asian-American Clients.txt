GUIDELINES FOR COUNSELING ASIAN AMERICAN CLIENTS DERALD WING SUE, PhD. A PSYCHOLOGICAL CORPORATION 1994Â© 

00:00:00
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Today, today's presentation on guidelines for counseling Asian American clients. Now, before I begin to talk about Asian Americans and Asian American culture and history and some of the issues that involved, are involved in multi-cultural counseling, what I wanna warn all of you is that the term Asian American lumps together a whole spectrum of groups. We're talking not only about Chinese-Japanese but Koreans, Filipinos, uhm, Southeast Asian refugees, Vietnamese, and so forth. So that is very important that we keep in mind that when I use the term Asian Americans, I'm talking about a diverse population. Now, all of you have seen the first three tapes that weve, uhm, made concerning multi-cultural counseling. The first one dealt with barriers to effective multi-cultural counseling. The second one which all of you have seen is racial cultural identity development and implications for counseling. And the third one is culture-specific strategies in multi-cultural counseling. What I'd like to do is take what weve learned from these three previous presentations and apply them specifically to the Asian American population. There are primarily three major objectives that we hope to accomplish in these training sessions. One of them is to have each of us become increasingly aware of our own values, biases and assumptions about human behavior. It's important for us to realize that almost all forms of counseling are indeed culture-bound that, for example, the schools of counseling and psychotherapy which all of you have been exposed to in textbooks is highly Eurocentric and oftentimes inapplicable to a culturally diverse population like Asian Americans. The second major goal or objective is to have each of you become increasingly aware of the cultural values, biases, a world view of lets say Asian American clients or the Asian American population. One of the major difficulties that I find in working with students and practitioners is the assumption that they make that Asian Americans, African Americans, ah, Latino Americans all share a common world view. And I can ask you this following question. Do you believe that there is such a thing as an Asian American world view, an African American world view, a Latino Hispanic American world view? Well, we dont want to be guilty of stereotyping. My answer to those questions is in the affirmative, that there are differences in how we perceive the world as different from our, uhm, white counterparts. The third major objective is to realize that Eurocentric modes of helping in counseling and psychotherapy maybe inappropriate and antagonistic to the cultural values, life experiences of Asian American clients. And what we need to begin to do is to develop culturally appropriate strategies in working with our Asian American clients. Now, I'm going to be citing some statistics that I want you to be, uhm, aware of. I dont want you to, uhm, write this down at this point and lose the essence of what Im saying because these have been covered in the textbook, Counseling the Culturally Different, and you can find it there. But those of you who will be watching this tape should have an outline as well about the statistics. One of the primary findings that we have is that the Asian American population now stands at 10 million in the United States. We represent only about three percent of the general population. And that seems small, but it's important to note that the Asian American population is the fastest growing population, uhm, in the U.S. Indeed, in the 1980s alone, we increased by a 108 percent. By the year 2010, our population in the United States will double and by the year, year 2050, were expected to represent, ah, 10 percent of the over-all population or something like 50 million or 50 to 60 million in fact. Ah, this large increase in the Asian population of the United States is due to two primary transient factors that we've seen. One of them is changes in immigration laws that began in 1965 and the entry of over 700,000 Southeast Asian, ah, refugees since 1975. In 1984 alone, over 282,000 Asians entered the U.S. So, that in terms of looking at the pattern, ah, Asians and Latin Americans represent the largest groups coming to the United States. For example, Asians represent of all the immigrants 34 of the, ah, percent of the population and Latin Americans represent another 34 percent. The other factor that is creating these demographic shifts in the United States deal with the birth rates of racial ethnic minorities. For example, the average number of children per mother, White mother, is 1.7. And this is in marked contrast to those, ah, rates given to Asian Americans, Asians, for example. We know for example, to give you some statistics, uhm, that it averages 3.4 children per mother for Vietnamese, 4.6, ah, for Laotians, 7.4 for Cambodians and 11.9 for among us. Now, uhm, this even boggles my mind in terms of thinking of it. The, uhm, birth rates, ah, I know that there's an old Chinese saying if I can share it with you very briefly and that is that the richness of life isn't the number of children that you have. Uhm, let me just say that my wife and I don't necessarily agree with that and indeed we've stopped, uhm, should have stopped after having one. However, that's something that is irreversible at this present time. The characteristics of Asians in the United States is truly changing. Ah, in the past, Japanese Americans represented the largest group in the United States followed by, ah, Chinese and Filipinos. What we have now is that, ah, our projections indicate that the Filipino Americans will become the largest group in the United States. Uhm, so that at this point, the Japanese Americans will decline consistently in terms of the, uhm, the ranking among these, uhm, various groups. The other thing that is interesting for us to note is that over 60 percent of Chinese Americans are recent immigrants to the United States. Before the 1960s, the majority of those in the United States were, uhm, born in the United States. What we're finding here, because of the immigration patterns is that the majority of Asians, except for the Japanese, are, uhm, those individuals who were born outside of the United States. I dont like to use the term foreign-born, uhm, because there is an ethnocentric flavor to that. What I mean by it is international-born, they were born outside of the United States so that many of these individuals who are coming to the United States are really oriented not so much, and this is a point that I made last time towards the assimilation and acculturation, the so-called melting pot myth of, in the United States. But they're much more oriented towards, ah, becoming a part of the United States but maintaining and retaining their cultural heritage. And this has created a lot of internal, uhm, conflicts and, and misunderstandings that hopefully, as we go through, uhm, this session, we will begin to understand a great deal more. California continues to be the, to be the primary state of residence of, uhm, the Asian American population followed by other states like New York and interestingly enough, Hawaii comes in third. Ah, and then we have other places like Texas, Illinois, Virginia on down. But you can see that the, well, we represent only at this point, 10 million in the United States. We are heavily concentrated in certain areas. For example in California, theres a, a heavy concentration of Asian Americans, but even regionally like, uhm, in the San Francisco bay area, a much larger pockets of Asians reside in, in certain areas. Now, what I would like to do in, in order to talk about counseling Asian Americans is to start off my reading briefly two cases, critical incidence that I call in, in terms of Asian American, uhm, counseling or working with Asian Americans. And then, you see cases to point out what I considered to be very important issues that we need to look at. Now, this case, ah, was taken from, ah, Counseling the Culturally Different, which all of you do have. Its entitled Culture Conflict and its about David Chan(ph). David Chan(ph) is a 21-year-old student majoring in Electrical Engineering. He first sought counseling because he was having increasing study problems and was receive, receiving failing grades. These academic difficulties became apparent during the first quarter of his senior year and were accompanied by headaches, indigestion and insomnia. Since he had been an excellent student in the past, David felt that his lowered academic performance was caused by illness. However, a medical examination failed to reveal any organic disorder. During the initial interview, David seemed depressed and anxious. He was difficult to counsel because he would respond to inquiries with short polite statements and would seldom volunteer information about himself. He avoided any statements that involved feelings and presented his problems as strictly an education one. Although he never expressed it directly, David seemed to doubt the value of counseling and needed much reassurance and feedback about his performance in the interview. After several sessions, the counselor was able to discern one of David's major concerns. David did not like engineering and felt pressured by his parents to go into the field, yet he was unable to take responsibility for any of his own actions and was excessively dependent on his parents and was afraid to express the anger he felt toward them. Using the Gestalt empty chair technique, the counselor had David pretend that his parents were seated in an empty, in empty chairs opposite him. The counselor encouraged him to express his true feelings toward them. While initially he found it very difficult to do, David was able to ventilate some of his true feelings under constant encouragement by the counselor. Unfortunately, the following sessions with David proved unproductive and that he seemed more withdrawn and guilt-ridden than ever. Now, I would like you to ask yourselves five questions to use as guidelines in understanding perhaps, uhm, what is going on, a clash of, of differences in world view between an Asian American client and the traditional helping styles and strategies which are used. One of these is to ask yourself the question, what cultural forces maybe affecting David's manner of expressing psychological conflicts? Second question, what possible unwarranted interpretations are being made about David Chan? For example, it seems that in this case, he's excessively dependent, uhm, etcetera, repressed. These are things that, that are, are being entertained by the counselor. Third, what stereotypes do you have about Asian Americans? How may stereotypes affect the holder of the stereotypes attitudes and behaviors? How may they affect the minority individual? Fourth, how may the counseling techniques used by the counselor clash with the traditional Asian cultural values with what effect? And fifth, if you were the counselor, what course of action would you take in working with David? Now, let me briefly, ah, make some comments about this case as we go into it in greater depth and detail. One of the things that studies on Asian Americans have indicated is that seeking counseling and help is not condoned within traditional Asian culture. One does not go out for help outside of the family to so called strangers, uhm, in asking for help. This is based upon the fact of a major difference between how Asians perceived themselves in relationship to the family. In the United States, the valued psychosocial unit of individual, ah, of a, of, ah, operation is the individual. Among traditional Asian culture, the priority is the family. The primacy is the family orientation. So that when one goes out for, ah, help to a stranger like counseling and psychotherapy, you are bringing not only dishonor to yourself but to the entire family. Ah, and as a result, many Asians are discouraged from going outside for counseling and psychotherapy. If this is indeed the case, one of the things that David Chan might be evidencing is that he is coming in for counseling indirectly. He is not coming in for, if he indeed is suffering or experiencing personal, emotional problems, he is presenting his difficulty as an educational one. And he maybe somaticizing. In fact, some of the studies that we have done, ah, the dealing with Chinese and Japanese, indicates that Chinese and Japanese, when they experience psychological stress are most likely to experience or express their disorders somatically - headaches, indigestion, etcetera. Now again, I don't want you to over generalize in the sense that if an Asian client comes in you immediately think, ah, and they've say that they are suffering from a headache, that you immediately think they are somaticizing. Ah, what you need to do, the responsibility, is to make sure that this doesn't not have a biological or medical reason as well, and to entertain other possibilities. But one of the things that we do find is that many Asians will express stress somatically so that this might be a hypothesis, ah, you would entertain in terms of working with the client here. The other thing is that to talk about educational concerns is much more acceptable in traditional Asian culture than emotional ones because, uhm, the parents of Asian, uhm, offsprings are very concerned about educational, vocational, uhm, you know, success of the children as particularly in the society. So what I'm saying to you is that perhaps we as counselors, are in a privileged position, an advantaged position to work with uhm, the Asian American population because if we define our roles as counselors and not therapists, uhm, then we might be able to, ah, you know, have, ah, Asian clients come to us for help without the social stigma attached with therapy. And I'll talk about this issue very shortly. The other thing that comes through clearly in the case of David Chan is that communication style differences, you know, in this particular case here the councilor noted that David's, Dave's short, polite responses didn't say very much. In traditional counseling and psychotherapy, we expect our clients to come in and to be articulate to verbalize things. You know, one of the things I often times hear about counseling therapy is that it's talking. You sit back do the talk therapies, you expect the clients to talk about what's going on and we as counselors might do less talking. However, in traditional Asian culture, ah, communication is, is not so much freer as opposed to that practiced in the United States. In traditional Asian culture, you are not spoken to, I mean, you do not speak until spoken to, and that the rules governing speech and freedom of expression is dominated by status, by age, generation and social prestige. And indeed, if you are an older counselor, and a counselor is seen as in, ah, prestigious situation, the client, the Asian client might find it very difficult to freely talk to you in the mode that we're used to what's going on. There are considerable variations however, I mean I've told some of you people that, ah, sometimes, ah, I wish that my son, who's going to turn 17 in October, uhm, was not so Westernized because he will sit at my dinner table and argue with me and I will say, "Jeez! What happened to respect for elders and etc.?" But what you will find oftentimes is a major difference in style in terms of, ah, communications so that communication styles do differ. The other thing that comes clearly evident in working with Asian clients is I hear that a lot of people mention that, "Jeez! There's long periods of silences," or that the Asian client is resistant or not very psychologically minded. Oftentimes, it is a statement of differences in communication style. To many Asians, silence is not silence as we see it, uhm, define it in our society. As I mentioned last time, you know, if you talk about silence in the United States, we have most of us, uhm, will start speaking if there, if we're conversing with someone in less than 3 seconds. You know, in fact, they find that, for example, if I started counting, one, two, before I, you know, before I hit three, if I haven't said anything and I'm talking to you, you will begin to talk. Among traditional Asian culture, silence is not always an invitation for you, the listener, to pick up the conversation. Silence may be signs of respect and other cultural factors that might be going on, or a difference in delay. For example, in studies of Asian communication patterns, there is a longer latency between responses that is not considered uncomfortable or a period of silence. And like I indicated to you, if you think Asians take a long time to verbally respond at times in a counseling session, then you should work with some American-Indian clients, who literally it is five, ten minutes of silence where you sit there and no verbalization transpires, although there is communication, a non-verbal communication that is going on. So that one of the things that I want you to realize is that cultures determine, ah, the degree and the frequency of communication and the pacing of verbal communication as well. A third thing that is clearly evident here is the family orientation that David might have and the individual orientation. Ah, if you were a counselor and working with David here, you might say that, "Jeez, he doesn't like engineering, lets give him a strong Campbell(ph) interest inventory counting him to make decisions, ah, as to choosing a particular appropriate career. And if you, if David was to say to you that, uhm, "Jeez, I have to talk to my parents about that." Our immediate reaction would be, "Jeez, what an immature kid this is." He's 19, 20 years old in college, he should be making decisions on his own, and yet he's overly dependent. And if we were using transactional analysis, what would we say? This is a parent-child type of interaction is an immature type of response, David should make decisions on his own, become autonomous, in fact most of counseling and psychotherapy are based upon getting individuals to become autonomous because individuality is equated with maturity and healthful, ah, and healthful functioning. In traditional Asian culture, when you act as an individual, apart from the consideration of the family, you are considered selfish, and that considered immature, so that one believes in the interdependence of the family. So when David says, I need to talk to my mother and father, it is very easy for a counselor who is unaware of these cultural differences to come to the conclusion that David is excessively dependent, that he has to mature and grow up. And indeed, we might be imposing our cultural values upon David. The other thing that this case really illustrates I think quite well for many of us to consider, is the appropriateness of strategies we use in counseling clients. Uhm, the empty chair technique I have found is oftentimes very effective with many clients. However, there may be cultural factors that would dictate that one would not use the empty chair technique. First of all, the empty chair technique tends to make individuals act out in ways that are very direct and confrontive or very direct in terms of expressing feelings and, and one's moods and, and opinions and behavior. What we do witness in this situation here is that David, might have gone through this behavior but then regret it and is guilt-ridden because, uhm, because he has been taught that one restrains your feelings, that this is a sign of maturity, that one respects elders and to tell my parents how angry I am at them is a sign of selfishness, and indeed, I've heard this from my parents as well, that you're thinking about yourself, and that what you should do is think about the health of the family rather than involved in this. And one submerges the feelings for harmony of the family and oftentimes Western, uhm, culture doesn't understand this indication of harmony and balance within the family here. And we'll talk about some of these techniques. The other case that I would like to briefly read and make some comments on before we talk about some of the obstacles of, ah, for us in working with Asian American clients is entitled The Language Problem. Mr. Robert Lemon, manager of a quality control section of a moderate-sized electronics firm in Silicon Valley was having difficulty with several of his Asian immigrant workers. While most of them appeared conscientious and responsible, a small handful of outspoken Asians within the company want a greater representation at the managerial and supervisory levels. As a result, the group was able to extract a commitment from upper management that the next managerial positions in the company would be filled, if at all possible, by an Asian candidate. This irritated Bob Lemon because the recently vacated opening in his section, because the recently vacated opening in his section, and the two Asian workers, Dang Van Yuan(ph) and Mary Chen, did not appear qualified. Dang(ph) and Mary seemed to have major language deficits. Being immigrants, English was spoken with a pronounced accent. Part of the Asian problem was that their constant use of their own language when speaking to one another. It prevented them from acquiring the necessary language tools to succeed. They were cliquish, always gathering together and excluding non-Asians from their group. Unless these workers begin to change their ways and practice speaking English more, they would always occupy the lower rungs of the occupational ladder. Some questions and issues that really basically, straight to the heart of cultural differences in the United States and which affects the world view are the following: Shouldn't minorities in the U.S. learn to speak good English? Ah, if indeed they want to succeed in this society. You know we hear this constantly being asked. Secondly, what does a supervisor's belief have upon Asian workers in terms of their self-esteem, ah, and self-image? Thirdly, if Asian workers are at a disadvantage in this work setting, what can be done to rectify the inequities. And four, where does responsibility for change lie - with the supervisors, with the minority workers, or with the company? Ah, now, these are very difficult and complex issues. Uhm, let me try to briefly address a few of them. The first one that is important for us to look at deals with, is asking ourselves the question that I see very important that is that, Is there an implicit equation going on here between one person speaking with an accent and that person's competencies and qualifications? Ah, more and more, like I was saying, uhm, the people in the United States are coming or being born from outside of the United States are bilingual, multilingual, English is the second language so that, are we, in some sense, uhm, biased and discriminating against people who speak with a, uhm, with an accent. You know, does, when you hear an accent what are your reactions to it? Study after study shows that we, as a helping professionals, have a tendency to attribute negative characteristics, uhm, to individuals who do not speak what we might call "good standard English", uhm, is really, uhm, an important point and issue for us to look at because increasingly we will run into situations like this. The other thing that seems to be bothering Bob Lemon, and which strikes to the heart that seems to be bothering a lot of people in the United States, is the issue of separation. One of the common reactions that Bob Lemon has is that they're cliquish. These Asian immigrants, when I walk in to the lunch room, they are all gathered together, they're clustering, they're separating from us, and oftentimes I could not understand why it bothered people that much for them to, ah, indeed, ah, see this clustering among various racial ethnic groups. Ah, it was only when I begin to ask people, I'd say, ah, What bothers you, what about the fact that when you walk into this classroom you see all the Asian students seated together, all the African American and I'll ask them this and, uhm, there was many reactions. One of the reactions is that don't they, don't you Asians want to get to know us? Don't you want to integrate in this culture and society? And my response would be something to the fact that, uhm, why is it that you always expect the Asians, the racial ethnic minority groups, to be the ones that reach out to you? Ah, what makes it difficult for you and isn't there reciprocity on your part to reach out back out. Ask yourself that question why is it that so difficult? Isn't this a two-way process that is going on and I'll proceed further by saying, well what other things bother you? And occasionally I'll hear that, well, they're rude because they speak in their own language and indeed they're talking about me, or they're talking about us, they're plotting against us, a very common reaction that a lot of people have in this society and culture is that when you see a group of racial ethnic minorities clustered together they're up to no good and plotting or doing something, ah, wrong. And I would say that, let's look at this. What functional value do you believe or can you entertain about why people cluster together? Ah, and I ask them this question. You know, if you go into a restaurant and you look at all the tables around, you will immediately pick out the Chinese, the Japanese, the Vietnamese family that are seated in the corner, or the African American family. Uhm, those that are racially, uhm, physically visible are the groups that you immediately pick out in a minute. Isn't that like them? They're separating themselves from us again. Seldom do you realize, as you look around that restaurant, that 99 percent of the tables are occupied by white people? And as a result, aren't you clustering as well? All groups have, you know, a need to practice and rehearse their culture. Ah, we shouldn't fear that, uhm, you know, you know, you've got to begin to realize the sense of negation and invalidation that many recent Asian immigrants might experience as they come into a culture that seems very different to them altogether. Ah, and a lot of times I can tell you about situations that happened to me. When I go to, uhm, well all of you know that there's, uhm, prior to our attempts to, to diversify the faculty here at Cal State Hayward, there's only two racial ethnic minority faculty members - uhm, Dr. Al Jones and myself. Ah, Al, for some of you who don't know him, is an African American psychologist on the staff that came about two, three years before I joined the faculty here. Now, one of the things I found when I joined the faculty, and it was primarily all white, ah, and there was 20 of us, we have a large graduate faculty of 20 full-time faculty members, was that when I would go in to these faculty meetings, I would find myself climbing over chairs just to sit next to Al. And I was really, ah, didn't realize that was going on. I would notice that Al came over and always sat next to me. And I begin to ask, "Jeez, does everyone notice it?" You bet I know that my faculty, ah, notice that and I'm sure that they were saying, "Why are they separating themselves? How come they're seated together?" Ah, there is something that is very powerful, you know, faculties have a culture of their own and when you go into a faculty meeting, a lot of what I want to present in multi-culturalism is not well understood or that there are biases or note some sense about it that are unwarranted. So when Al and I argue for multi-culturalism in the courses and so forth, we frankly experience a lot of different reactions that tends to invalidate us. For example, I've gotta be constantly vigilant, are they understanding what I'm trying to say? Ah, when I, when I leave my faculty member and joined, uhm, a group of my graduate students who might be in the cross-cultural option it's like, ah, now I can relax and don't have to be on guard constantly and vigilant. It's like the cultural nutrients need to be present. When I got my graduate degree at the University of Oregon, I was in the doctoral program, one of the things I noticed frequently was that in the small doctoral seminars, we would talk about these theories of counseling. And I would raise my hand or make a statement that, you know, Freudian psychology is very sexist and racist in orientation. And I would make that comment feeling good about the contribution, hoping that the other students and the faculty member would realize, Jeez, he's really got an important point here. Ah, guess what the reaction was. Nothing. I mean, it wasn't that the teacher disagreed, the professor disagreed or other graduate students, it's just no one said anything. It just hung up there. And I could see that idea almost like float down and splat. You know, I mean, if you talk about this sense of invalidation and when I would, uhm, go elsewhere, uhm, talk to other people who had the same concerns with racial ethnic issues I would feel like validation, the cultural nutrients. Another example I can give you is this, uhm, and then I'll tell you why it is so important for us to clarify. You know, when I travel throughout the United States, I feel physically ill unless I have rice. After about two or three days, it's easy now, it's less, you're all laughing but it's less, ah, it really is less of a problem now because it seems that any place I travel, there are always Asian restaurants that you can at least buy take-out rice. But, you know, used to in those old, old days, and I won't tell you how old they were except that you know I got my doctorate in 1969 and started experiencing this but, ah, one of the things, after three or four days of eating, I would feel so hungry because I was used to starches. And my wife knows that when I come back home, even now, no matter what time of the day or hour, it can be two in the morning when I fly back, she used to have this large bowl of white rice waiting for me, I mean, its uncontaminated. It can be rice pilaf or rice pudding, it's gotta be, here's white rice because that's what I hunger at. And I suddenly realize something that when I eat at a U.S. restaurant that does not serve rice, uhm, after about half an hour, I feel hungry. You know, it's, it's very, you know, it's very similar what I hear many of you say that, Jeez, after I go to a Chinese restaurant I, I love Chinese food, but after about half an hour, I'm hungry. That's because when you go to a Chinese restaurant, you don't eat enough rice. I mean, I've watched how you eat. You have this little bowl of white rice and then all the dishes come out from you and then you eat a couple of grains with your chopsticks. By the end of the, of the meal you've eaten, you still have a whole bowlful. You know, my brothers and I eat bowls and bowls of rice, I mean, not, I mean, I'm talking about huge bowls of rice, because that's the starches and since I don't eat, ah, breads or potatoes, I really starve and lose a fantastic amount of weight. But to me rice symbolizes cultural nutrients. There is nothing that has more impact among us. That's why one of the things that people will oftentimes talk about is that while there is disparity in the Japanese market dealing with rice, rice to the Japanese is so culturally sacred and symbolic, it is very difficult to break into that market, even though that market, uhm, you know has brought a lot of political debate. But what I'm saying is this, every each and everyone of us have a need to practice and rehearse our culture. Don't see it as a threat. Uhm, if you allow people to be truly who they are, to live and practice their culture, they are more likely to reach out to you. That's the irony of it. Did you know, for example, that the Chinese in San Francisco Chinatown are more traditional in Chinese than the Chinese in Honolulu? Or much more traditional in Chinese than the Chinese in Hong Kong or Taiwan. And you ask yourself the question, why? It's why is that the Chinese in the United States have formed communities, Chinatowns, J-towns or Japan towns, Vietnamese towns, Korean towns? To act as buffers to what they consider to be a society that does not tolerate, uhm, cultural differences, and everything in the mass media tends to invalidate so that, uhm, you cling on even more tenaciously to that. While the Chinese in Honolulu, or Chinese in Hong Kong have evolved because of, of the differences, the less negation of the culture and lifestyle. So I ask all of you that when we begin to work with cultural differences, we shouldn't do what people used to talk about which to, is to tolerate diversity, tolerate deviancy, I mean differences which are equated with, uhm, a deviancy. What I say is that we should actively value it. I don't like the word tolerance. I like the word value - to see it in a positive sense. Because that denotes an attitude. And when we begin to get to the point where we have that attitude, I believe that people would be willing to reach out. But as long as we keep negating one's identity, cultural world view, the person will cling to it more tenaciously without reaching out to you and forming, I think, the important bridges that are needed. Now what then are the major barriers, I think, for many of us in working with Asian American clients? Uhm, there are essentially four that I find of importance for us to deal with in, ah, working with Asian American clients. The first of these are stereotypes and pre-conceived notions that many of us entertain and have unknowingly about various racial ethnic groups, and particularly, Asians in the United States. The second one is that our communication style, our counseling-helping styles maybe antagonistic and indeed not be helpful to Asian American clients or families at all. The third one is that we need to begin to recognize that all counseling and psychotherapy come from a culture-bound basis. I don't mean that in a negative sense. I mean that in a sense that there are culture-bound values inherent in how our schools of counseling and psychotherapy. And I'll talk about how those cultural values manifested in, uhm, in counseling can oftentimes conflict and not prove helpful to various racial cultural groups. And the fourth major obstacle that we need to work through is prejudice and racism. Interestingly enough, you know, and I, when I talk about prejudice and racism, I am not simply talking about conscious overt prejudice and racism. What I'm talking about are the insidious, unconscious, unintentional, ah, prejudice and racism that many of us are unaware of. And to me, those are more powerful and more damaging at times and, ah, the overt ones that we frequently talk about and which frequently makes the, ah, you know, the news. Now, let's first of all talk about stereotypes and images. One of the dominant stereotypes, uhm, of Asians in the United States is that somehow we have made it in this culture. You can pick up issues of U.S. news and world report, Newsweek, Money Magazine, ah, you know, article after article during the past ten years, have occurred in which you have had titles like A Success Story: Asian Americans or Asian Americans Outwhiting Whites. You know, on and on, these titles indicating somehow that Asians have made it. And these beliefs are fuelled by certain statistics that seem to hold up realistically. One of them is that Asians as a group have higher educational attainment than all other groups in the United States. And I'm talking even with, ah, white Americans, that as a group Asian Americans have higher educational attainment. Yes?

DR. DERALD WING SUE  Okay. Okay. That's, the question was, in response, for those of you who didn't hear it, is that a recent article, a study that came out through the San Francisco Chronicle indicated that African American, ah, no, African immigrants from Africa, ah, indeed have even higher educational attainment than all other groups, but that their income is below that of their white American counterparts. And this is something, I think, that we need to look at because it is equally true with respect to Asian Americans. That another dominant belief about Asian Americans is that we're well represented in the technical professional levels. But when we begin to look at those and I'll get to those, the statistics are very similar to what you've been saying that, uhm, we have over-education but indeed rise less high than our white brothers and sisters, and in some sense, make less money, even in light of the educational attainment that we have. The other, ah, statistic is that we have higher per family income. Again borne out, that as a group, Asian Americans tend to have higher family income than any group, ah, in the United States. Another one is that we have low official rates of divorce, low official rates of juvenile delinquency, low official rates of mental illness. Now, you noticed that I've emphasized official because that is the key point that we need to look at quite carefully. Now these figures, historically and politically, have been used to do certain things. One of them is to validate that the United States is a land of opportunity, that any racial ethnic minority group can make it in this society if they work hard enough, and look at your Asian brothers and sisters. Now that also has a second major effect in that and has fostered oftentimes antagonisms and conflicts among various racial ethnic groups. Ah, its almost seen by, uhm, by many Asian American leaders as a divide-and-conquer type of play that is going on. We pit one group against another, Asians against blacks, blacks against Hispanics, Hispanics against American Indians. And while this is something that is spoken about, it is not something that is, uhm, explored and dealt with in detail. And the other thing that these statistics have oftentimes been used to do is to somehow deny Asian Americans as being an oppressed group and needing special programs and policies or practices that need to be changed. Now, let me look at this statistics with you because they are very important here. One of the statistics is high educational attainment. The Asian American group is not one, uhm, homogenous group, it is very different. You will find that a large group of Asians indeed have high educational attainment, but that a large group has less education than even their white counterparts. But if you average and lump these together, we see an average that distorts the bimodal distribution that is present among these various groups. The other statistic dealing with higher family income, ah, we have a higher family income primarily because we have more members of the family working in family-owned businesses. If you look at it per individual, per capita, we fall below the white, uhm, means. So that again, this tends to be not discussed. You know, if a group is successful, social scientists said that we should see that they do have lower rates of divorce, uhm, delinquency, mental illness state they are not experiencing as much stress in this culture and society; what this fails to realize is that the indication that Asians tend to believe strongly in, ah, in the impression of the family identity. Let me give you an example, if I succeed in school, ah, if I do something well because of my family collective- collectivistic identity, if I succeed in school or occupationally successful, ah, I may have great good feelings about myself but the entire Sue family shares in the pride of a son that represents the family that has done good. Likewise, if I fail in school, if I, ah, am hospitalized because of a mental illness problem, I will bring dishonor and shame to the entire family. It's a group identity. As a result, the family has a lot invested in making sure that the public perceives the individuals as reflections upon the family in a positive way. So that oftentimes, the reason why Asians as a group may underutilize traditional mental health facilities is primarily that, uhm, it is a social taboo and a prevent. It doesn't mean that we have less emotional psychological problems, but it means that it is dealt with in terms of a family, you now, and this is a point that we need to look at quite carefully. Now, the other Asian stereotypes that oftentimes happen is that people talk about the positive and negative stereotypes. To me there is no such thing as a positive stereotype. All stereotypes are inaccurate representations of reality. Ah, and as a result they do great harm and damage. You know, just because you believe that Asians are successful in school and you encounter an Asian that might be having difficulty in school, it can do equal harm to that student because of the stereotypes that you have, and the reaction that will occur as a result of this. Now, to give you some idea of how stereotypes are so powerful and influential, that I can give you an example of when I went to Washington High School. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon and one of the things that happened to me when I was younger was that as I graduated from Eighth grade and went to Washington High School as a freshman, at those times we were assigned a counselor. And the counselor was one who would be your academic from freshman to senior year until you graduated. And usually the counselors were other teachers, I mean, no one had a formal training. And I remember my counselor's name, Mr. Canewton(ph), a white male teacher outstanding math teacher, in fact, he had been honored in the State of Oregon for I believe two or three consecutive years winning awards because he had the most number of students who won Science Fair State contest. Well, during my first week in school, Mr. Canewton(ph) called me into his office and, you know, my cousin Larry had just graduated, uhm, and Mr. Canewton(ph) had been the adviser for the senior year and now he was rotating, he called me into the office and of course I was slightly anxious for fear I was gonna, I've done something wrong, but he says, Derald, I'm so glad to have you for my student, you and I are going to work closely over the next four years. Uhm, Derald you know, you know your, your cousin Larry, won, ah, the Bachelor on Science Award, and you know that, ah, it is only given to the outstanding senior science student. And, Derald, I know you're going to win it, too, because you people are good at that. Ah, now, you know, here is something that really had major impact upon me. One of them, ah, was that I was flattered, you know, here was a man who was showing, uhm, ah, interest in me, who was have, is showing faith in me and at the same time, I did not know at that time why I felt uncomfortable and uneasy. And, it was also only years later in, uhm, in college during my senior year; I realized what was going on. You know, Mr. Canewton(ph) Canutan had this image stereotypes about Asians being good with numbers, good in the physical sciences, poor with words, poor in the social sciences, poor in people relationships. Ah, my wife believes that about me but, ah, that's, ah, personal issue. You and I are dealing with together. Ah, but in some sense, what we're dealing with here is a dominant stereotype of what Asians are like. And, Mr. Canewton(ph), regardless of what, how well-intentioned was a person as much a victim of the cultural conditioning of the society. But, he meant well. See, here's the dilemma. I mean, I, I really can say that of all the teachers I've ever known, Mr Ca, I had the most respect for Mr. Canewton(ph). He was an excellent teacher. I took every one of his Math classes, uhm, ah, Physics classes. I've had, you know, when I graduated, went to, ah, ah, college, I would come back and talk to him all the time. You know, he was my connection with Washington High School. He's passed away years ago now but I remember coming to and, I had the greatest respect for him. Ah, Mr. Canewton(ph) was not a mean, evil person. I mean, do, do you know what I'm saying' Uhm, he only had the best intentions for me but at the same time, he affected me in a way in which I did not switch out, ah, of, uhm, of my, uhm, science, Chemistry, ah, courses until my junior year in college. When my, ah, academic, ah, ah, professor at that time told me I had to take, ah, social science and Humanities requirements if I wanted to get out of, of, ah, graduate out of Orient State University. And, of course, I avoided them. All sophomore years, I avoided all these courses because I thought I was bad at it. And then I took my first course in, uhm, ah, Psychology, forced to take it and, I got an A in it. And, I suddenly realized, hey, look it, this is, uhm, this is really easy. Ah, I didn't even have to work, ah, and I got an A in it. It's common sense. It was a real, I didn't switch majors because that it was easy but, uhm, ah, primarily because I realized I loved psychology, and I loved, ah, I had the ability to understand things from an anthropological and psychological perspective. But, I, you know, many of us who are the victims of, of, uhm, stereotyping never make it out. And stereotypes can be broad and, and, and quite ah, ah, of, you know, powerful in terms of, of determining what's, ah, happening. Now, as in, now is in on our side, I want you all to know that I did win the Bachelor on Science Award. (laughter) But, ah, this was because of the driving force that Mr. Canewton(ph), ah, gave to me and, ah, maybe that doesn't support the point that I'm trying to make about stereotypes that, ah, the other thing that, ah, ah, that is really important for us to begin to look at is helping styles, counseling styles as, ah, ah, important point in working. One of them that I would like to share with you that really brings home to me about how people in different cultures perceive helping and counseling. With all the experiences I had with my father, I remember several things about my father. One of them is that, ah, in the traditional, ah, my father is very traditional; he even now refuses to speak English. Uhm, you know, ah, he clings on very strongly to the traditional ways and I used to have great arguments with him, ah, because I thought he was old-fashioned. Now, I regret those times and I now understand and I go back and, and I'm different, ah, ah, in, in my relationship with him. But I remember a lot of times, uhm, that it was traditional, that if you encountered some difficulties in school like anxiety, ah, problems with your siblings, ah, you would seek an audience with, ah, ah, with your father. Ah, and my father was always very traditional, aloof and removed from the everyday operation of the family but all decisions, ah, and I know now that they really didn't happen and we would talk about, ah, Asian cultural, ah, ah, you know, ah, relationships among, ah, husband-wife, and, and gender, ah, age types of issues as determinants of behavior but on the surface, it had to appear that my father made almost all of the major decisions in the home. And, I would sit before him and sometimes talk about how I was doing in school and my anxiety about an upcoming, ah, ah, presentation and how I was really hung up by it because I was very shy when I was young. Giving an oral report was agony. Ah, and he, you know, when I see, ah, would tell him this, you know what advise he gave to me as I sat before him and when and talked about it. He would say, Derald, don't think about it. And I was say, huh, you know? Uhm, you know, now, as I look back on it, ah, as a psychologist, I would say, what a, what a ridiculous, uhm, ah, ah, response to make. Most of us in the mental health fields, uhm, if, if a client comes in and presents you with an issue, we say, "okay, achieve in sight, let's analyze it, let's think about it, let's get into it, ah, this, you know. Let's deal with it." And here my father, sat there, and simply said, don't think about it. In other words, again, only years, in fact, he would, he would say something else, and this indicates, ah, ah, the complexity of value systems. He would say, Derald, the reason why you're anxious, is that you're thinking too much about it. And he would say, you're thinking about yourself as an individual. If you think about the good of the family, these fears and anxieties would, ah, begin to disappear. Ah, and there were cultural values of the family versus the individual. You're sink, thinking about your, ah, self too much as an individual. Ah, the other thing I realized, ah, in studies years later, Roger Lund, ah, one of the social service, uhm, administrators in this area, did his doctoral dissertation on, ah, Chinese concepts of well-being and mental health in the San Francisco Chinatown. The highest factor loading that, ah, ah, Roger came up with among Asians, a road to mental health was avoidance of morbid thinking. This is a very dominant strategy that is used by traditional Asians, ah, ah, Chinese that you deal with things by avoiding morbid thinking. Ah, you know, and this is not very different from a lot of what we talk about in terms of what Lazarus talks about healthy denial, Richard Lazarus, who has a stress coping studies, not, uhm, ah, Arnold Lazarus, the multimodal person. But, Richard Lazarus' study have revealed that, ah, in many situations, avoidance of morbid thinking, what he calls healthy denial, is highly functional and more and more of the cognates of psychologies are beginning to accept the fact, indeed, that, ah, that to avoid morbid thinking is a strategy that we should teach clients. Ah, that goes directly counter to a lot of our training about insight, about, ah, getting to the heart of, of what's going on and I realized what my father was saying, that I was misunderstanding the cultural factor or force in which he was coming from. The other thing that I noted was, ah, the, that if you did not tell me that, the other way that he would, ah, tell me, ah, how to approach a situation was in fables and stories. I mean, I would literally have to sit there for half an hour, 45 minutes, and he would, she would say, Derald, that there's, there's, there's this old Chinese story about the Chinese General Say Sung(ph) who said, and I'd sit there and have to listen to it and by the end of the story I still wouldn't understand what he was saying or the point that he was trying to make. But, he expected me to do that and it was then that I realized that, that there are differences in how cultures relate to one another. Subtlety and indirectness is a highly priced art in traditional Asian culture. Helping, therefore, is very subtle and indirect as well. Ah, in the United States, our helping tends to be out-front direct. Identify the problem, solve it. What are the things that we do? And cultures vary, ah, ah, in their strategies, just like the empty chair ter, technique, might have been very in-, ah, ah, inappropriate for David. It might be very inappropriate also for other racial ethnic minority groups that value the subtlety, the indirectness of, of communication and helping, ah, ah, styles that, that are done. The other thing that, ah, drove home to me, ah, cultural differences and how, ah, ah, we work with one another is indeed the question that my father would oftentimes ask me which was this, uhm, he would ask me, see, he would ask me, Derald, ah, how can you be called a doctor when you're not really a doctor? Well, you know, if, if that is something that I've had to deal with, ah, ah, you know, since I entered graduate school, it's at, ah, as a psychologist, we, ah, are always placed on a lower status than our, ah, ah, medical, ah, counterparts. And here, suddenly, my father is saying how can you be called a doctor when you're not really a doctor? Ah, you know, my comments would be, well, Dad, you know, I, did you know that it's harder to get into an APA-approved doctoral program in Psychology than it is in medical school? Ah, this didn't impress him, believe it or not, ah, he thought it was a height of stupidity for anyone, ah, to, you know, to go into something that, that was, ah, less desirable and, and, but with more difficulty to get in. Ah, and then I would say, and the other thing, Dad, you know, I go to school as long as, ah, as, ah, ah, a true medical doctors which means that I bought into his system already and that, ah, I serve in internship. I wore these white jackets at the VA hospital, you know, and all of these. So, he was never impressed about this. And, he would only follow up by asking, well, what is it that you do in this counseling or therapy? (laughter) Ah, and if you've ever had someone ask you that question, ah, who, who you share a cultural perspective. You will find it even difficult to answer. And the way I answered it was that, oh Dad, I sit there across some people and, ah, I talk to them, you know, and, and his only response would be a hmm, they pay you for that? Ah, in psycho, in China, Psychology is not well understood. It is not considered a legitimate field or occupational, ah, ah, choice here. It's a very difficult, ah, ah, concept. My, my dad now handles it by, he does refer to us as doctors to his friends but he never tells his friends what type of doctor we are. Ah, he's proud also, in terms of showing all the textbooks we've written but he never talks about what they're about. Ah, in actuality, something that ah, is important for all of you to realize, is that my dad, my dad handles it very well, ah, because the way that he handles it now is that he tells all his friends and relatives that we are, ah, all the brothers say, by, by the way, I haven't mentioned, I have three other brothers with doctorates in the field, ah, but, you know, so they did something wrong, you know. My mom and dad had something to blame for this choice. But, ah, ah, what they do, do is to tell their friends and relatives that we're all professors and, ah, some of you again understand the cultural implication of this. In Asian cultures, scholars are revered and respected, given high positions of prestige. In the United States, we don't teach our educators, our teachers, we tre, treat them like second class citizens. Even though we voice the fact that children are the most important commodity of this nation, we really don't put it up in terms of, of education. And, ah, again, I would say that, that's a major cultural, ah, ah, difference that, that is seen here. The other thing, ah, that is important for us to, uhm, realize in terms of these, ah, ah, communication styles like I have mentioned is that there a lot of, most cultures, especially Asian culture is highly non-verbal. Helping and communication operates non-verbally. In, ah, a traditional U.S. culture, we are a highly verbal, ah, society. I mentioned this to you before that, ah, it's either the spoken or written word that we value. In almost all other cultures, strangely, uhm, ah, most of the other societies and countries, non-verbal communication is given extremely high weight. Uhm, ah, for example, in traditional, ah, Asian culture, traditional Asian culture is considered to be a high-context culture while the United States and Anthropology is considered a low-context culture. That is said, ah, you, you know, the words pay attention to the meaning of the words, the content of the words; while in Asia, one can say the same thing in two different situations but the context determines the meaning. Ah, and that is a very important thing that creates miscommunication. Let me give you an example. Uhm, I once did some diversities training for a hospital. And in this hospital, the doctor was talking about an example or incident that happened between he and a Filipino nurse. He was walking in front of this, ah, ah, hospital room watching the Filipino nurse, ah, you know, monitoring or doing something with, ah, I guess, life sustaining support systems that was incorrect. So he came in to the hospital room and told the, ah, ah, told the nurse that this was incorrect, that she needed to do such and such at this point and to do, ah, manipulate these gadgets or the patient would suffer and maybe die. Well, then he asked the, the nurse, do you understand now what you need to do and the nurse said, yes doctor, I understand perfectly. And the doctor left the room, came back later, ah, and walked by and the nurse was still doing it in the same way. Ah, at that point, he became irate, called, ah, ah, the nurs, another nurse to, ah, ah, to take over from the, ah, a Filipino nurse, asked the head nurse to come, demanded that this Filipino nurse be fired. Ah, little did the doctor realize, ah, that there is a cu-, strong cultural dictate about how one communicates, not understanding and, ah, ah, the situation here. When the doctor asked the Filipino nurse, do you understand what is going on here, it would have been considered culturally inappropriate for the nurse sai-, for the nurse to say, no doctor, I don't understand. To say no in that direct fashion has additional hidden meaning and, ah, the meaning is that, ah, you are a poor teacher. And it was considered improper, impolite to respond in that way. Ah, yet, I think, all of us realize that we need to bridge the gap. We can't use this cultural misunderstanding as not having legitimate medical treatment that is going on. So, I would ask you what other way might the doctor, if they were aware of these cultural gaps, ah, have, have taken the initiative, to bridge the gap in understanding. 

01:06:45
[sil.] 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN  Model. 

01:07:00
DR. DERALD WING SUE Okay, the, the answer here was to model what needed to be done. And I would agree, all the doctor would have had to do was to say, to show the nurse what to do, and then to have, ah, ah, not only modeled it but to ask the nurse, now can you do it for me. And then, if the nurse, again, incorrectly does it, to step in at that point and to redo it. That would have been it. Now, the issue, ah, here is that it seems insignificant but it's major. These miscommunications because of differences in how people relate to one another oftentimes create major problems here. As, as the doctor, ah, was about ready to have the nurse fired, if the nurse wasn't fired, the patient could have died. Ah, these, you know, these might seem, uhm, a minute misunderstanding but with major implications. And, and oftentimes, however, to be an effective multicultural counselor, to bridge this gap is not so much a science, as an art. And that's why it's very difficult sometimes for me to say, these are the things that you would do, it depends on your awareness of what the issues are and your creativity in devising alternative ways of, of helping people. And this is one thing I find sorely lacking in our profession that we do not take the time to begin to be creative in terms of how we can go about bridging the gap. There is no one way to do it, but perhaps, many ways. And it requires all of us to, ah, ah, work on this together. Now, I can see that, ah, we're going to run, ah, over in time but what I wanna do is quickly cover some other, ah, ah, areas that are important, ah, as well. Now, some of you might really want to begin the process of, of exploring, ah, other areas that deal with Asian communication styles because they give us great insight into how we might be able to modify how we communicate with, with others. Ah, ah, the third major area is culture-bound values. Now, one of the things that I've mentioned before that is important is that, ah, in the United States, the psychosocial unit of operation is in an individual. Among traditional Asians, the psychosocial unit of operation is the family. And that is all important for you to realize. Indeed, ah, oftentimes, like I was saying, in the case of David Chanoff, he said, sir, I need to talk to my mother and father. We might make, uhm, negative, ah, ah, you know, and we will see him negatively as being inhibited, being passive, being dependent, ah, you know, being immature, a whole host of other factors that are a result of these major, uhm, clashes. To give you some idea of how this affects even the way that we operate with one another. If you, ah, if all of us in this group was to meet one another in the classroom, in the hallways, the most likely greeting response when we meet one another is, how are you today, right? You know, my father never greets people that way. When he runs into family, ah, friends, his first, how is your family today? And I submit to you, that represents a major difference in world view, that my father's orientation is family, collectivistic, uhm, ah, ah, unit of operation while in the United States, we're much more prone to deal with the individual. This also comes out in affective expressions by your clients as well. When most of us do things wrong, uhm, ah, we might begin to experience some feelings of guilt. Traditional Asians, if they do something wrong, might experience guilt, all right, but they are highly, they are highly likely to experience feelings of shame. Feelings of shame reflect upon the family or group. Guilt is much more of an individual affect while shame is a group affect. So, we talk about counseling and therapy, if we're talking about identifying fee, the feeling tone accurately, many of us who work with traditional Asian clients may misidentify the feeling tone level and this feeling of distance that occurs between, ah, the counselor and client may occur which leads to a, ah, perhaps premature, ah, ah, termination. Ah, the other thing that is important when we talk about the family identity of, is this and we, we talked about this earlier, ah, last week that dealt with the fact that, ah, traditional Asians define the family much differently from how we define the family in the United States. Ah, in the United States, a family is a nuclear family, ah, the husband, the wife and the, ah, ah, blood-related offsprings. In many cultures, like Asian culture, that goes back to ancestor worship, the family includes aunts, uncles, grandmothers, uhm, ah, grandfathers and on and on. That constitutes the, the, ah, ah, unit of operation, ah, of the family, so that, in family counseling, we oftentimes misunderstand, ah, ah, at, you know, at, ah, at some level, ah, when, when the whole family comes in. And these family dynamics get played out everywhere. You know, in the United States, when you invite someone to a social function, ah, if you do not, ah, mention bring your family or children along, you, only the adults are invited. Ah, that is really quite different from, I know, Latino, Hispanic culture and Asian culture in which an invitation automatically means the family. So that I've seen, ah, misunderstandings where, where, ah, a, a white neighbor holds a, a, ah, ah, you know, ah, a party for the new neighbors and invites a, the, ah, ah, you know, couples in the family and the Asians come with all their kids and grandparents and everything else and, ah, you know, the, the misunderstanding and the feelings that occur as, as a result of it. So, ah, looking at these, ah, ah, culture bound values, ah, are important. The other thing is that Asians believe, oftentimes, in restraint of strong feelings. Ah, my dad for example, believes that, that wisdom and maturity are associated with one's ability to control feelings whether the feelings are, ah, indeed, ah, ah, positive or negative, you know, anger, ah, is controlled but also public displays of affection are controlled. Ah, and, indeed, what frequently happens is that relative to U.S. culture which are much more freer in, ah, ah, expression of feelings, the traditional Asian family or client might be seen as repressed, inhibited. Ah, in fact, Stan and I did, ah, studies at U-, UCLA, the, ah, psychiatric, ah, clinic in which, ah, an interesting phenomenon occurred. We were doing research on the Japanese, ah, ah, students who utilize the psychiatric services. And, many of the colleagues came up to us and said that, geez, we're so glad that both of you are researching the Japanese because the Japanese students, did you know, are the most repressed clients that we work with. You know, and I always entertain the possibility that we're working with a, a repression in a psychiatric sense but it seems to me that they did not entertain the fact that the repression that they saw or labeled was indeed cultural dictates about appropriate expressions of feelings and, and behavior. And, that again is something. Ah, the third thing that is important is that, ah, the roles, duties and expectations in the traditional Asian family is dominated by age, sex, uhm, generational, ah, status. Traditionally, Asian culture is very patriarchical. Men are more valued than women. Now, ah, we can get into this issue, about, ah, ah, issues of equality among the sexes, feminism, ah, and I think that most of you do understand that in traditional Asian culture, men are more valued, in fact, some of you, I, I wish all of you that the opportunity to see The Joy Luck Club. Ah, if some of you have seen it, you have really a powerful statement about also not only a mothers and daughters relationship but the role of women in traditional Asian culture but what is very, uhm, ah, interesting about this is that not only are men more valued and on public seen to be the, ah, ah, decision-makers but also, ah, age is, ah, the hi, the greater the age of the individual, the greater the status you have in traditional Asian culture. Ah, in the United States again, that's completely reversed. It seems like the older you get, the less status and prestige you have. And these cultural differences in terms of role, behavior and expectations can play themselves out in a counseling session. Ah, what I mean is that supposing you are a female counselor and all of a sudden, ah, the family comes in and the family that you're working with is my family. Ah, my father's name is Tom, ah, my mother's name is Lucy and, you know, I come in and, you know. You know, one of the first things that happens here, are, are a number of different things. You are a woman. You are younger than my father. Immediately, this, ah, is oftentimes perceived in Asian culture as insulting, that you are the one that should be, ah, ah, paying you dues, to, to my father. And, worse yet, if you, ah, call my father by the first name, it is insulting. Ah, you know, again, there are really major differences. You know, in, I, I've seen a lot of people in our clinic, one of the things they say counseling is much more, well, in our culture, we're much more egalitarian than other cultures. And oftentimes, I'll say, ah, see a counselor and say, ah, Tom, Lucy, will you please have, ah, a seat. Ah, introduce your children, or, or on and on. This is insulting. You need to address my father, Mr. Sue, how are you? Ah, you know, ah, again, in family counseling and therapy, some of the things that we're taught in diagnostic science, ah, as we've talked also with the Hispanic Latino, ah, ah, family is that you always first address, it a sign of respect, is to address the man first. Now, this might go against, I, I understand, ah, ah, when you talk about, geez, this goes against my feeling that there should be equality of sex roles and maybe the, the, ah, family will move to that direction but what you need to do is establish credibility with this family if you want to work with this family effectively. Likewise, how you present the issue to the traditional Asian family is important. If you, for example, are seeing me in individual counseling and you suddenly realize that the family is very important, to ask the family in, for example, for family therapy would be a taboo. My, my family would not come. The way you present, the, the request for help is all important. For example, you might ask, ah, call Mr. Sue up. Ah, you would call my father up. Mr. Sue, uhm, ah, this is, uhm, ah, Mrs. Jones, I've, I've been working with your son, Derald, at the, ah, counseling center and often quite a bit we talked about his career and vocational things, ah, and I'm wondering whether it's possible for you and the family to come in so I can consult with you about what, how best we can help with Derald. Now, I'm, I'm saying this again. These are things that oftentimes, you know, we, we can't write them all down. They require our ability to understand the world view, the cultural values and to have enough, enough flexibility to alter the way that we work with people. Lastly, ah, and geez, we've gone clear over the time, ah, and they will probably cut us of in the taping here, but. Ah, the last major issue that I wanna talk about, ah, very quickly, we've dealt with it all this morning, this prejudice, racism, and discrimination. As I've indicated to you, ah, ah, continuum here, if you look at the history of Asians in the United States, it is a history of oppression and discrimination. And, ah, there is no doubt in my mind that there is a current rise in anti-Asian sentiment. And this is also played out currently by the anti immigration, ah, ah, ah, factors and forces that are occurring in California and, ah, throughout the nation. And you can go on and on, in te, in terms of talking about but oftentimes, ah, the, not, the, the experience of racism, discrimination and prejudice affects the world view of Asians about, ah, ah, themselves and others.So, that oftentimes, ah, as I've mentioned to you, ah, an Asian client might come in and not immediately self-disclose because they wanna find out whether, whether you're really there to help them, and, and, a process of testing will occur or whether you really understand, ah, what's going on, ah, with them. The second thing that we need to all realize, ah, is this, that counseling and psychotherapy can be, what I consider to be cultural forms of oppression. That, for example, if I believe that for David, ah, David Chan to be healthy, he has to break away from the family, has to make decisions on his own; is what I consider to be ah, oppression, that you are imposing your cultural values upon a client who is very different. And the goal of affective multicultural counseling should be, in some sense, to, ah, ah, allow for cultural differences where people can, ah, ah, work these issues on their own. So that, in summary, what I would like to do is go back, basically, to the three objectives that we, we've talked about; is that all of us need to really begin to understand what our cultural values and biases are all about; that we need to begin to understand that we have a world view. That world view is influenced by our society, our culture, our upbringing. Ah, and most forms of counseling and psychotherapy are Western European in origin. That they may or may not be culturally appropriate, ah, in working with, ah, ah, different groups, ah, ah, in this society. The second thing is that, if we begin to be honest about our selves, to reach out, to begin to understand the world view, the cultural values of people who are different than us, the Asian-American perspective, ah, perhaps, we can begin to understand how we can begin to relate to people better. And then the third thing is to begin to realize that, that how we work with people might imply that we need to broaden the repertoire of our responses. Two warnings, uhm, and then I'll stop there. Ah, the first warning is essentially this, a warning, ah, to realize that what I'm talking about today, ah, should not be used as rigid, ah, ah, guidelines applied to all Asian-Americans. Asians differ considerably with, within group between group differences are vast. Ah, these, ah, points that I'm raising should be, serve as guidelines to be tested out and discarded and/or changed when they do not apply. Ah, and, an example I can give to you is a, ah, one of my former, ah, ah, student, a woman, a white woman who is working with a, ah, demonstrating abortion counseling. And one of the things that she did was that, with a white, ah, ah, client who came in, she begin to talk about her feelings and, ah, ah, options, when she begins to work and demonstrate, working with an Asian client, she begin to give advice, suggestions, information, avoided the feelings and when we process the tape afterwards, ah, I asked her, you know, what dictated one or the other and she said, while you have outlined that Asians that tend not to express their feelings and on and on. And, I suddenly realized what had gone on. Ah, that she had rigidly applied what we were talking about to both of these individuals even though both individuals did not behave significantly different. It was a stereotype that was being, ah, ah, put on here. The second thing is to realize, as I've said before, we can't be all things to everyone. You know, there really, the diversity in the population makes that impossible. But ah, you know, what we can do, however, is to realize what our limitations are. You know, I've worked a long time in developing what we call multicultural counseling competencies. Ah, and it is never possible to achieve those ideal goals. What we can achieve, however, is to realize what our hang-ups are, what our limitations are. And, that when I encounter a client in which my training, my knowledge and skill is short that I would seek consultation, seek further training or education or consider referring out to someone who has greater knowledge and understanding. And, I think that baby, basically we'll, ah, ah, end today's session. I wanna thank you all for your, ah, attention and for sitting through this. Thank you, ah, (applause), okay, ah, what, ah, what I'd like.
