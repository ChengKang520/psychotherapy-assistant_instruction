MICHAEL MOBLEY, PH.D. Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey Hi, good afternoon and thank you for coming to the presentation. Um So, the title of our presentation for me is Cultural Validity of Hope: Facilitating PEAK Experiences in Community Partnerships. Ah through my introduction Dr. Lowe actually gave you a preview of the topics, I am going to be talking about and those includes the Grant Projects and the Community Engagement Projects that I’ve been involved in both in Columbia University Kansas city, Missouri, and then on behalf of the business 17. And before I move into my presentation, I want to emphasize that the work that I’ve done really has only been successful because of the number of ah individuals who worked with me in a team capacity and one of those persons here is Dr. Rebecca Toporek who I will acknowledge in the presentation a little bit later. But I couldn’t have done any of this work without graduate students, without faculty, colleagues, without administrators, and teachers in the schools, as well as individuals and the community in Columbia University. So, I want to thank all those folks. Ah. We are first familiar with this quote that “It takes a village to raise a child.” Ah and it’s also written here in the Nigerian Igbo culture proverb. For myself I realized that I have been raised within a village not only as a child, but also as a professional and so that’s why I want to start of this presentation giving acknowledgement to colleagues and mentors and also teachers in collaborative who have helped to, helped me to go professionally and doing the work that I have done in the past 7, 8-10 years. I will share with you a brief introduction talk about the Columbia MU REACH project, the Columbia PEAK project, Stepping up to the Plate, Giving Back to the Community. And then talk about what I mean about PEAK experiences and why I have been entitled part of my presentation as Cultural Validity of Hope. In the sake of time, I may actually move through some slides quicker than others. In terms of my background, it was mentioned in terms where my training has took place. I also wanted to thank Dean Andrews he was college of education dean when I arrived to University of Missouri and he encouraged me to get involved with urban education and he said I would like for you to either concentrate on St. Louis at Kansas City. There is couple of initiatives going on, if you want you tag along with some faculty and see which one you're interested in and so that’s how I got involved in the GEAR UP project in Kansas City, Missouri. I will talk with you more about becoming a President of the Community University Partnership ah as we go through. GEAR UP stands for Gaining Early Awareness And Readiness For Undergraduate Programs. It was initiative that came out the Clinton administration prior to him leaving office and you can see what the mission is there, is to help cohorts of low income middle and secondary school students, so they increase the number of them going to college and graduating from high school. REACH itself is an acronym that I came up with and it stands for Raising Every African American Child Higher. I had some conflicts about this definition initially being a multiculturalists, I wanted to be sensitive to the school competition, ah but throughout the three years at the middle school, and then the tree...four years at the high school, most of our students say 95 to 96% were African American children. Ah our partnership was formed by the University of Missouri as the host institution as well as those two schools they were in Kansas City, Missouri. And you can see what our primary focus was, very comprehensive developmental focusing on career, personal, and social development. I just got provide for you brief overview of the number of partners that we had involved in our project and I want to acknowledge just a couple of those, one I want to acknowledge to person, (inaudible ) Dr. Carolyn Tucker and I will talk more about her Research Based Program Model as we go along because she was very instrumental, again, as one of those mentors ah in helping me through this process. Ah as I went through the MU REACH project, Dr. Tucker’s Self-Empowerment Theory of Achievement was the overwriting philosophy and theoretical framework, but being a trained counseling psychologist and being exposed to Bandura’s Self-Efficacy Theory, Holland’s Theory of Career Choice, Social-Cognitive Career theory, and Multicultural Counseling, African American Psychology also influenced my decision making and the way that I thought about the project from day-to-day, month-to-month. More specifically, her self-empowerment theory of achievement I'll refer to SETA has five primary goals in terms of working with children and adolescence, these are the target points in terms of helping children to be successful, not only in terms of their academic achievement and outcome, but also the social-emotional academic outcomes as well. There were six target skills that we included within our program and we attacked these target areas in terms of providing workshops and in class lessons for the students, so we helped to increase their communication and socialization skills, their daily living skills, and I want to take one moment to talk about that one. During the summer, we bring the students to University of Missouri’s campus and one particular summer we took them to a local restaurant for dinner and it was amazing how of course number of the students had never been to a restaurant, I should say many of the students had not been to two hours away to University of Missouri-Columbia, they are pretty much lived in Kansas City urban community. Ah so helping them to learn how to have social etiquette at a restaurant was really helpful. Ah another target area, reduction and prevention of maladaptive behaviors, self-esteem enhancement and academic performance enhancement and of course you would have imagine this particular last target area was really critical to our partnership with the schools and also instrumental and significant to GEAR UP initiative in terms of helping kids so we prepare for college and graduate and high school. It is the responsibility of every adult especially parents, educators, and religious leaders to make sure that children hear what we have learned from the lessons of life and to hear over and over that we love them and that they are not alone. This quote was really significant in terms of how we as adult would engage with our students and GEAR UP Project and we did have religious community members both involved in the project who are serving as role models for the kids to again, enhance their self-esteem. The other three corners stones within the self-empowerment theory of achievement, one is success behaviors and that’s helping kids to know what’s expected at them and to give them positive feedback, ah the feedback formula helps us to do that when they are on target and behavior are supposed to half(ph) task particularly in the classroom, and then the step-by-step method. In terms of the success behavior, we actually provided the students with a list of success behaviors Um and gave them this introductory paragraphs, so they would be oriented to those and we had a baseline of 21 successful behaviors and Dr. Tucker has (inaudible ) and I will allow you to look at these I go through them. And so when we initiate the program with a six grade cohort, which was roughly almost 300 students, we gave them a copy of the success behaviors, but we also gave a copy of success behaviors to the teachers and we gave the copy of the success behaviors to the parents and we also had parents sign a contract with us that they will be supportive to their child in terms of going through the GEAR UP MU REACH Project, but also helping their child to engaging in these successful behaviors. Um the last success behavior never give up, which really critical. Um we found that sometimes kids would become discouraged and they would be called this particular such behavior. One of the ways that we also engage the teachers with success behaviors that during the period of time, what to say… we will have these teachers focus on five success behaviors during a week, and then the teachers will give feedback to the students and give them actual points if they were appropriately engaging in those success behaviors. And so we kept track of those, and then at the end of academic year, we would give students an award, I think it was my, not my (inaudible ) electronic games, PS something, I don’t know what it was that time, but one of those videogames that they were all excited about went to the person who had the most highest points for demonstrating successful behaviors during their sixth grade year. Ah another quote from Denzel Washington reads “My mother never gave up on me. I mess… I messed up in school so much they were sending me home, but my mother sent me right back.” Um. In terms of the feedback formula itself we again we shared all these with the students, and the teachers, and the parents through a handbook. Each of them had their own handbooks, they got readily were able to see this information and this is another part of our communication skills, when there is communication skills that we were targeting with the students. And I will give you an example all the way that we actually implemented this. Ah when you play with other students while I am trying to help you with your homework, I feel disrespected and hurt. In the future, I would appreciate it if you would pay attention to me and your homework while I am helping you with your homework. Remember the rule within the Central Middle School PEAK Center is to stay in your seat and pay attention during homework and study times. Now, we help that the teachers would use this form of communication to the children not only focusing on behavior, but also focusing on their emotional response, and then giving them some encouragement to be on task with behaviors. Now, I had the luxury of hiring a project coordinator who also saw the students on a regular basis. She would meet with probably about 30 students every 10 days and the cohort each grade level and so she really drill this home with the students and they took to this. And I'll also make mention of this when we get to the (inaudible ) PEAK project how I used it in that context. Then, we also had a series of parent workshops. I am just gonna have you look at the title and the objectives for those. We did hire a parent coordinator ah doing the eighth grade year, and then that really took off during the high school years and so that individual was responsible for providing these workshop to parents. I will say that it was a struggle as in many communities and many school districts to have parents getting engaged, ah but we made our best efforts to increase the level involvement with their kids in different types of ways and of course trying to get them to come to the school for different workshops and so forth. Our best turnout of course is when we collaborated with the school around PTA and/or giving back report cards. Ah within the MU REACH project, there were four major components that we focuses on, one is the PEAK center and PEAK stands for Promoting Empowerment and Affirmation via Knowledge and that was both in terms of school academic as well as social skills program. And then the computer clubhouse is something else that we actually had put one in the school itself and also we had community based school clubhouse computer clubhouse that was located in the Baptist church in the community. The other component was the summer visits to the University of Missouri campus and that we also extended that when they got to high school to take them to other local community colleges and university both four years and two years, so they can get exposure so what college life was like, and then finally, the fourth component was an extensive professional development training for the teachers and in a very first initial year, what I had to do as I actually brought in Dr. Tucker and allowed her to provide training to the Middle School teachers, ah and then I took careful notes in terms of her delivery and style, and then I begun to provide their training subsequent years to the teachers as we moved from one cohort group to another. And I must admit that it was awakening experience for me to be in that training with her, to flown her from Florida and set everything up, and then, to be a librarian, watching teachers, sort of sit off on the side on the floor and have conversation, some teachers lying right in front of her were Michael was sitting here and putting head down and going to sleep and I was so, so embarrassed, but I learned that you know different professional standards may take place in academic setting or public schools. But I wasn’t deterred, I didn’t give up, I kept coming back and giving more training, particularly to those teachers who unveiled themselves to the opportunities. In the PEAK Center, we had to install computer systems. Ah the server in the school was not effective. It was constantly going down, so we end up putting and changing our budget around to actually buy a server and had a computer technician that we had hired to go and put a server into the school. So that we can have some consistency in terms of providing educational resources to the kids through computers and most of the computers have these screensavers and so we put up famous African American folks to help the students in terms of increasing their African American history and knowledge. We also gave the students a small research project in terms of having them investigate the lives of these African American individuals. Life skills was again focused on by the project coordinator who again met with the kids every 10 days. She will give them different lessons and so forth and I remember her providing lessons to the students on one afternoon and her approach was very stern, very formal, and she made clear that the students knew the high expectations and standards were set, but she also had fun with the kids and so they were having fun in the learning process and then I guess it disturbs some of the teachers and the principals, so they all come running down from the principal’s office asking what’s going on, what’s going on, and there was nothing going on, but learning and enjoyment of learning, but they were not used to hearing kids laugh during the process of learning ah and so that was an interesting experience. Um I provided a quote that one of the students gave to the project coordinator as they were going through these life skill process. They really shows how again it was important to focus on self-esteem and building the self-image of some of our students. Ah physical learning environment space was really critical. Again, I talked about having to put in a server. But we're also responsible for running some wires and putting down electrical conduits in the church in order put our computer clubhouse together. Ah and that's like something we could have expected when we went into the partnership. Ah but we have also to do some similar things in the school environment setting in terms of edifying the classroom assign that we were assigned in the basement nonetheless but yet we made great use of that space. Ah we provided a brief multicultural counseling group experience to our students particularly during the first year that was not originally in our program description, but in meeting with the principal she encouraged us to do that. She thought that there were a lot of issues that the boys and girls were experiencing and so she wanted to group for both boys and girls, and then she also wanted to mix group and we were willing to ah certainly meet her need and Dennis Kivlahan(ph), Dr. Dennis Kivlahan(ph) was involved in this as well as six to seven graduate students who literally would getup at 6 o’clock in the morning and travel two hours to Kansas City in order to provide these groups to our students and you see some of the issues that came up during that group. In terms of providing feedback for the GEAR UP Grant for the department of education. They required you to do some type of an assessment and evaluation. They will give you a template for critical ah data points that they want to know about in terms of how the student’s academic grades, what’s their attendance, what’s number of disciplinary referrals, but they don’t give you any guidance in terms of how to assess other aspects of the student’s development. And again being a counseling psychologist being exposed to as Dr. Burki(ph) said Dr. Buki(ph) said one, carrier developmental issues, educational issues. There was plethora of things that I could chose from it, these are some of the measures that I used from the literature in order to assess what was going on with our students in terms of making a difference in their lives. And perfectionism in their one of my personal interest. But I want to take time to know the children’s hope scale and focus on definition of hope. It reflects an expectation of goal attainment. Agency is one component of hope, that defies by Snyder that talks about taps of person's sense of self, successful determination in meeting goals in the past, present, and future. And then pathways as the second component that taps person’s perceived capability to generate successful plans to reach their goals. And one of the things that I forgot to mention to you when we expose the kids in the sixth grade to those 21 success behaviors, I had the joy of walking into the Middle School one afternoon and then seeing right next to the principal office that those success behaviors had transformed into my 143 or 42 success behaviors. When I enquire from the teachers and principals what’s going on here? They said what the kids said to us there’re other things that we know we should be doing to demonstrate success in school and at home and so the kids actually generated an additional 120 something success behaviors and I was just beaming of course because that’s the essence of empowerment of giving some knowledge to these children, affirming them to create that PEAK experience. And so that was my goal throughout the seven years of working with the children, but also I’m working with the parents and working with the teachers and administrators. I'm just gonna share with you a few interventions that we did and in 9th grade, we did a character education program that focused on the freshman seminar and these were the topics that we focused on. We provided this intervention by solacing support from teachers as well as school counselors to provide these instructions to the children. We also did a career exploration journey and I would like to publically thank Dr lowe(ph) and Brakel(ph) (inaudible) University of Missouri, Kansas City and her doctoral students and masters students because they were the ones who helped us to provide the service. Dr. Brakel(ph) actually provided the supervision to the students, and then the students came in and did the workshop with the students, our students in the Middle School level, I mean high school level and then we also compensated those masters students in terms of giving them reward. And exploring career paths is actually manual that we use. The career path planner for secondary students was another regulated manual that we use in terms of providing this intervention. And throughout this process, we really want to emphasis, reading, writing, and problem skills. As one of the things that we learned very early in the 6th grade with our cohort is that we had developed these basic, we thought were basic life skills, instructions, and exercises. But we found that the most of the students were reading at the 3rd or 4th grade level and so we really have the backtrack and then change some of our curriculum materials and resources and just changed how we approach them to increase their math(ph), I mean reading literacy and so forth. And so, we took opportunity to do that in each and every activity that we provided to them and here are some of the typical things that we would teach them during the career exploration journey process. Overall, in terms of looking at some outcomes from the MU REACH project, again over the seven years, we served about 766 African American students ah primarily. Again, 2.75 million dollars, half of that came directly from the Federal Government, the other half we actually had to raise ourselves in terms of contribution and so when I showed you list of those partners, they were really critical and helping us to secure the additional match. Ah in terms of my own role, in terms of the administrative physical and budgeting and all that stuff that was a very new territory for me that clearly I did not learn in terms of my counseling psychology program. But I did find a mentor and doctor, Dave Roberts who was in rehab and who had been administering a number of grants and a women name Ms. Linda Garrett(ph) who was over the academic retention program who knew about the university budgeting and so, there were other key folks who really helped me to learn that process, so that I could become more efficient and appropriately manage the physical and budget aspects of the project. Ah and again, they were critical and helping with the implementation and monitoring assessment and evaluation. I saw that was really important for me to faster trusting working relationships with the district superintendents, the school principals, the school teachers, as well as those community members. Ah they… I can’t tell you how many times I would actually have a meeting with the superintendent, or assistant superintendent and arriving Kansas City after driving two hours to only be told that they either forgot about the meeting or they couldn’t make to meeting and sometimes they knew about it two or three days ahead or they weren’t in the practice of necessarily communicating to you that oh by the way our appointment has changed. So, there were some my own frustrations that I had to deal with and adjust in terms of collaborating with these partners. But yet I thought that we were able to, to the most part establish a dynamic collaborative community based partnership and as we know no partnership is without ups and down, whether to community based partnership or one-on-one partnership or working in teams of any sort. Some of the more specific academic and um tangible outcomes that we achieved was an increase in attendance of our students, decrease in behavioral problems and disciplinary referrals over the course of the year and I am only providing data from a couple of different years here. What we did in terms of looking at grade level performance is that we would compare our cohort to the prior cohort in the same Middle School using the state data as well as any internal data that the school district calculated and so we saw definite increase in terms our students overall performance relative to their prior cohort. Um and this one indicated to Missouri Assessment Program or MAP that’s the state wide test that's used in Missouri as well as the Missouri Improvement School Plan, the MSIP and so at the course at the end of the project, I had the opportunity to look back over the entire seven years and again compare our students to their prior cohort and each year we actually saw an increase in terms of overall students performance, in terms of their grades and some of the behavioral indicatives, in terms of attendance and disciplinary referrals. Ah When we move to the high school, we were able to establish the 1st Parent Resource Center for that high school that was very effective in terms of increasing our capacity in connection with the parents. Ah for the 11th grade, we had the highest number of cohorts in the 11th grade year that participated and we had an outstanding graduation rate compared to the prior school year. In terms of the Columbia PEAK project, I want to shift to this one. This is the project that I got engaged in colleagues at University Missouri-Columbia. Ah prior to the GEAR UP REACH project starting, Dr. Roger Worthington and others were talking with Dr. Tucker about doing something in the Columbia Community in order to decrease the dropout rate among African American students and they ask me of course knowing my interest if I would be interested in joining them and I said to them well and I can only do that if I can somehow combine the two with this GEAR UP Grant project as there is no way I can run this new project and that started in 99 and also help on Columbia and so I was already thinking about how to use an empowerment model of intervention with student’s in Kansas City but I also had written Dr. Tucker’s theory into our Grant proposal. So, when I knew that she was behind the initiative in Columbia PEAK project, and then it made a very easy for me to combine the two. So, some of these overheads will be repetitive in terms of the similar interventions and the philosophy and the corner stones that we used in the Columbia University partnership. Ah so, I will make reference to that. But again, in terms of our initiative to help improve the educational outcomes of African American students of Columbia-Missouri, ah what we did is we look for community partners. Ah there was a team of faculty who came together and from these different departments and administrators, there were community members who were already focused on youth in the community that we were able to partner with and representatives from all of these different groups came together initially during that first summer in May throughout August and September to talk about whether or not we were fully adopt Dr. Tucker’s program and so we brought Dr. Tucker to Columbia and gave her an opportunity to present the faculty and staff, present to Church leaders and African American community leaders and parents as well as school administrators. And so, we wanted to have (inaudible ) from the entire community population if we were gonna move forward with this initiative. Because I think Arts and Science Universities in particularly faculty may move forward initiative without doing that initial legwork and making so, we have buy(ph) it. So, it is critical to do that on the front end. In terms of my role, again I was elected surprisingly to be the President of this non-profit organization. So, we called this as the Community University Partnership or CUP and it also meant that I had to learn and look at 5013 statures(ph) and so forth, so we can actually physically apply for a non-profit status and so I was engaged in that activity while again moving towards 10 year at MU. So, we can talk about that later. But it was real life experience in terms of saying how we can actually access our particular status in order to bring the resources we need to make the change in these student’s life and so that’s why of course took that one in terms of my efforts. And over the course of the four years, we had this project, which secured about one million dollars in grants, donations and contributions. And again, I want to emphasize that with the project director for community, Columbia project, Columbia PEAK project is really critical(ph) woman named Dr. Pam Harston(ph) was very instrumental, (inaudible) was instrumental, because I could not do the things I was doing without having them on the ground and actually running the program day-to-day as I dealt with the board and so forth and interestingly in terms of dealing with board and we have seen this from before, as we came together one of our students and educate school psychology actually took offence(ph) to having us use any type of intelligent, standard intelligent tests for to assess the outcomes with the Columbia PEAK children and we had a faculty member, a prominent school psychologist of African American background, who was very adamant about using traditional assessment measures to score their intelligence and so being the President of the board and both of these people who are on the board as members I put it for both as a consensus and unfortunately, the student want that I actually supported the student’s decision, but then my colleague actually resigned from the board and I wonder how that then effected our relationship as colleagues over the years. Ah but you know that’s what the things that happens. Again, we used these three corners stones in terms of working with the Columbia PEAK project, we had the success behaviors who were posted in the Church, our physical facility was the Baptist Church in Columbia located in the (inaudible ) and largely African American low-income neighborhood. The students would meet twice a week from 4:30 to 6:30 and there would be assign a buddy and that buddy would be there, with them to once when the first hour going over homework that they had from the school and send the second hour actually focusing on life skills development. And we had teachers, one was a retired African American teacher from the public school system who was there to lead and coordinate that as well as Dr. Pam Harston(ph) and some other project staff. And the buddies were actually largely undergraduate students from the University of Missouri-Columbia. Some from the teacher developmental program, some from African American studies and a number of African American are students of color. One of the things that we found for some are white student buddies as that particularly those in teacher development, but they felt very uncomfortable coming to the after school project. One it was located in the hood. Second, it was largely space filled with African American both children and adult and that was an new experience for these undergraduate predominately white females and so, we recognized and got some feelings that they were feeling uncomfortable and so provided some training to them beyond the training that we’re prepared. They really focused on multicultural and cross cultural relations and interactions. And then we built that training up the second year. And I am also very proud of that because I think it helped to increase to create… to create increase diversity of our teachers who are… our students are becoming teachers and that was something that is lacking in the overall teacher development program, but after a two or three years, the students are really talking positively about their experience and feeling more comfortable interacting with African Americans and that gave them something to talk about when they were going out looking for jobs in the teaching profession. Ah again, some of the outcomes for the Columbia PEAK project over the four years as that we had about 75 students participate. We started from the third to eighth grade and we’re allowed, we stayed with the students as they move from each grade level. So, we kept it at a very small number. Most of them were African Americans. It was not exclusive to African Americans, not African American students were certainly invited to participate and we did have a few white students and Latino students in the program. Some of our success evidences are provided there for you. And then, we also did an extension of the Columbia PEAK project. The women who ran the Columbia Public Housing Project was also involved and supportive our initiative. And she asked if we could actually provide a similar program within the public housing community and so we actually changed the name of that program and was called you can make difference program and we set that up in the Columbia Public Housing Community space in two different locations in town. And again, the staff who was running our primary project are really instrumental and doing that as well. Okay. So, our ultimate goal for both these projects was a slogan that I coined was “Helping children and their families REACH their PEAK” and one of the phrase that Dr. Tucker repeatedly use is that “When African American children succeed, All children succeed.” And that’s something that was really important to share with the school administrator, with school teachers as some of them received a program as only catering to African American student. And so we were clear to say that while that’s our primary focus and target, we are sensitive to all students in our program. Now shifting to another project Stepping Up to the Plate: Giving Back to the Community. This is an initiative that was undertaken by Dr. William Parham during his presidential year in division 17 the society of counseling psychology and again it was special task force, task group that was performed and again Dr. Toporek was here with us was a coach here who worked with me and I wanted to thank her again for all her work and continued work that we’re doing together and currently that initiative is known as the Community Engagement Committee and give you a brief background in terms of what our aim and objectives there Dr. Parham wanted to make sure that every time we visit the whole city for APA that we actually give something back to the community and so that was his vision, that was his goal and they asked for Rebecca and I to sort of be able to materialize that goal and implement that goal and so they give back we have to create a structure in the process for how we would cover…I mean carry that process out and I won't be able to go into that in depth, but feel free to ask me any questions and I known Dr. Toporek will be speaking probably tomorrow and she may actually talk a little bit about that as well. But our first inaugural implementation year coincided with APA being in Orleans immediately, I mean a year after her hurricane katrina. And so that created a number of challenge for us in terms one just connecting with community members ah in order to find out what resources were needed, of course there were plethora resources that were needed in the aftermath of Katrina. Ah but there are efforts we were able to partner with a couple of different entities, one being the Louisiana Children’s Museum, we provided a Coping and Trauma Workshops for adults as well as the parents in the community and we partner with women Sarah Hoffpauir with the New Orleans Mental Health and Resilience Task Force. And one of your goals is to also maintain those relationships to have an ongoing relationship with our partners and so we invited Sarah to present with us in APA and subsequent years as well as the National Multicultural Conferences and Summit. I also want to thank Dr. Priscilla Dass-Brailsford and also Dr. Nancy Boyd-Franklin. Priscilla was a community give back committee member as well as the CEC committee member and through her work with Dr. Nancy Boyd-Franklin. They went and provide a training to the pastors and we went into do our initial legwork in terms of creating our projects with the community. Priscilla had a chance to meet with a number of different churches and knew some folks down there. And so she was able to go back with Dr. Nancy-Boyd Franklin and continue to provide resources and support to the community. On following year we went to San Francisco and I am just going to share as there is a couple of projects that we had here one working with the homeless center and we had volunteers both professionals as well as students who support that initiative. We partner with a radio program by bilingue(ph) I can't pronounce it fully, a Spanish language public radio program and we recruit a psychologist who had expertise in background in this area to actually be a part of the radio program and that’s one of the primary task that we do in terms of how we carry out this process as recruiting volunteers and facilitators to help us with these initiatives. In Boston the following year we partner with the Ten Point Coalition, a group of clergy who had had a longstanding history in the Boston community particularly attacking violence among youth and then the community and so we focused our concentration around the workshop of our Community Violence and Training. And we were very excited to see both youth and parents and community members and educators come out for this workshop and it was just quite moving experience for us all who participated. Then in Toronto we had one primary partner again Access Alliance for Multicultural Health and Community Services and this was just a phenomenal event for us. I learned a great deal through this workshop myself in terms of reaching out and finding and learning about how we can create evidence based practice with emigrant and refugees population and I would like to thank Dr. Lisa Zazukey(ph) she was Latino(ph) speaker ah again, a person who volunteer to give up her time and service so that we can carry this partnership out in terms of giving back to the community. And then the give back was transformed into Community Engagement Committee as a way to ensure that it becomes an institutionalized part of the division of 17. And so that subsequent years the society will be able to continue to reach out to individuals and communities and organizations who were on the margins in these different communities. Overall in terms of thinking about the work that I have done in these different projects, this comprehensive community building initiative is something that I found in the literature a number of years ago and I think it speaks to how I high approach working with these different communities and how I tried to stay focused on ways I can effectively engage with and create partnerships with the individuals that we were working with and again PEAK Promoting Empowerment and Affirmation via Knowledge is actually something I thought of 1997 when I volunteered with the lesbian gay task force or black lesbian gay task force in Washington D.C.. And a basic effort here is that I think as professionals we have a great deal of knowledge and information that we can impart to different communities and bearing that bear in terms of resources so that we can help to affirm these individuals and also empower them by giving them knowledge to advance their own quality of life. So again what inspires me as relates to this topic of hope for the winter roundtable. Back in 1992 when I started my Ph.D. program my dissertation I wanted to focus on the Sociocultural Experiences of Urban and African American Adolescence and I was told by my advisor who I loved dearly and he is a great friend then. I think him as my father figure, well we don’t have too many of those students here in the Penn state Happy Valley. So you probably have to change your topic so therefore I worked on perfectionism. But nonetheless when I got to University of Missouri, Columbia you notice I acknowledge Dean Andrews because again he gave me an opportunity to go to Kansas City , to go to Saint Louis and find a way to connect with the kids. And so I think that my dream that I had for 1992 really became a reality one when I got to University of Missouri-Columbia and quoting this professor economic professor "True academics are supposed to listen to their inner voice, set their own agendas and disdain the noisy voice of the world requesting service advice, direction, vision, application. I personally I am a client-centered academic. I like to use psychology for practical, applied purposes to solve problems or to help people to find new and better ways of addressing policy issues and practical problems." This professor goes on to say that "Sometime referring to community members as customers want the objectivity, the thoughtfulness in the teaching-based communication skills and the breadth and depth of analytical ability and background that they can bring that they find only in a university professor and I certainly believe that as counseling psychologist and some of us who are clinical psychologist are trained to have a well rounded focus and ways to engage and connect with communities to bring different resources to bear. And also as a trained multicultural counseling psychologist ah that really helped me in terms of reaching out to African-American students in educational forum. And as I said earlier my initial approach was to work for an empowerment intervention paradigm in terms of how I was going to engage with the students in Kansas City using Dr. Tucker's theory to help us look at all points of influence from our environment. Boyer has a definition of scholarship application that I thought was also very pertinent to my approach as an academic scholar engaged in these activities. And he says service activities must be tied directly to one’s special field and knowledge and related to and flow directly out of this professional activity. Such service is serious, demanding work, requiring the rigor and the accountability, traditionally associated with research activities. Subsequently new intellectual understanding can arise out the very act of application whether in serving clients in psychotherapy, working with public schools in activities such as these theory and practice vitally interact one renews the other. And I found this to be true for my experience in terms of working with the MU REACH project and Columbia PEAK project. And so again in terms of our focus for this conference and other caption I came out with as I see myself as trying to empower minds and transform lives over the past seven to eight years and that is something I wish to continue to do in the ways that I engage with communities. And for me HOPE gives birth to resiliency that without HOPE I do not believe that we could have an experienced resiliency. HOPE is universal. HOPE is culturally unique and HOPE is transformative. When we think about these major national and international events that have occurred most recently in our society and we look at most of the news clips or reporting particularly of those folks who had been most harmed and injured by these natural tragedy. I have been so amazed to hear them repeatedly and repeatedly again say I have always had hope, I was holding out hope that I would survive that I could recover that I would be able to move home again to Louisiana, or move home back to ah, ah Texas or wherever the hurricane may stroke...strike. And so Jesse Jackson were as keep hope alive is really critical and another quote by Anita Baker says “you leave home to seek your fortune and when you get it, you go home to share it with your family” and so that’s really captures the spirit or what we are trying to do in the give back initiative now in the Community Engagement Committee. And finally President Obama said “There’s nothing false about HOPE” and I truly believe that, that if we think about what we do from the time we wake up in the morning to as we go through our day and we go through each week and month and the particular task that we choose to focus on the people we choose to engage and support and make a part of our lives that I would submit to you if you think about it the HOPE is that the essence of what drives us in terms of those relationships, in terms of those choice activities. I know that’s what has driven me over the last years in terms of way I choose to engage with communities and form partnerships. So thank you for coming to the presentation.
