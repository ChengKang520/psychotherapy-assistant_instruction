Universal and Unique Approaches to Solving Problems 

00:00:10
Sam Gladding Wake Forest University 

00:00:40
SAM GLADDING Welcome. I'm Sam Gladding. 

00:00:40
Dawn Calhoun Wake Forest University 

00:00:40
DAWN CALHOUN And I'm Dawn Calhoun. 

00:00:40
SAM GLADDING This video is on family therapy and some of the universal and unique approaches used in this process to solve problems within a family system. 

00:00:50
DAWN CALHOUN Everyone has a family. And families are complex and diverse. 

00:00:55
SAM GLADDING Some of the most common types of families found throughout the world are: the nuclear family, a core unit of husband, wife and their children; the multi-generational family, households that include at least three generations; the single-parent family, which includes one parent who is solely responsible for the care of self and a child or children; and the blended family, a household created when two people marry and at least one of them has been previously married and has a child or children. 

00:01:30
DAWN CALHOUN There are also dual-career families, childless families, aging families, gay and lesbian families, and multi-cultural families. A large percentage of difficulties people have in life have their origin in families and many of the ways of resolving problems can be done within a family. That is why working with families is so important. 

00:01:50
SAM GLADDING This video examines some of the universals associated with families regardless of their type or background. Often, helping families examine these patterns in, is therapeutic in and of itself. Then we will focus on some unique techniques associated with popular therapeutic approaches. 

00:02:10
DAWN CALHOUN Counselors and families often need help in navigating developmental and situational aspects of their lives. Most family therapists recognize the following concepts in how families work. This knowledge may not only useful, but even therapeutic. 

00:02:25
Communication 

00:02:30
SAM GLADDING Communication: all behavior is seen as communication. It's important to attend to the two functions of interpersonal messages: content, that is, factual information, and relationship, how the message is to be understood. The "what" of a message is conveyed by "how" it is delivered. 

00:02:50
WIFE See this? The trash is full. I put it up here because you don't seem to notice when it's under there. 

00:02:55
BEN I told you I would take care of it. Can I fix my coffee first? 

00:02:55
WIFE For weeks you have said you would take out the trash and I do it every day. You never see it. You never get around to it. 

00:03:00
BEN I will take care of it, but it would just help a whole lot if you could ask a little bit nicer and-- 

00:03:05
WIFE What do you want me to say? 

00:03:05
BEN If you would just say, "Hey, when you're done fixing your coffee would you just remember to take out the trash it'll get taken care of. 

00:03:10
WIFE When you're done fixing your coffee, would you mind taking out the trash? 

00:03:20
BEN Yeah, I'd be happy to. It's not a big deal. 

00:03:20
WIFE Okay. I can live with that. 

00:03:20
BEN Okay. 

00:03:20
Family & Couple Rules 

00:03:20
DAWN CALHOUN Family and couple rules: a family's or couple's functioning is based on explicit and implicit rules. Rules provide expectations about the roles and actions that govern family life. Most families and couples operate on a small set of predictable rules, a pattern known as "Redundancy Principle," or the "family dance." To change dysfunctional ways of working they have to define or expand the rules under which they operate. Sometimes families and couples can solve situations by themselves by recognizing what they are doing and that it's not working, as in this scenario. 

00:03:55
WIFE Wow! Ben, we have an extra $2,000 this month. 

00:04:05
BEN $2,000? 

00:04:05
WIFE Yeah! I don't know how we did it. 

00:04:05
BEN That's nice. We-- 

00:04:05
WIFE Yeah! 

00:04:05
BEN can actually save some money. We keep talking about doing it, but we never get around to it. 

00:04:10
WIFE Well, we also keep talking about taking a vacation and we haven't done that in years. 

00:04:15
BEN You-- 

00:04:15
WIFE I thought we could take a trip together. 

00:04:15
BEN You always keep talking about taking a vacation. 

00:04:20
WIFE Because you never prioritize our marriage over your work! 

00:04:25
BEN Really? That-- 

00:04:25
WIFE Yes! 

00:04:25
BEN I am not doin' this right now. 

00:04:25
WIFE Time out. Time out. I don't want this to end the way it always does with you storming off. Is there any way we can meet in the middle on this? Is there any compromise we could find? 

00:04:40
BEN Well, what are you thinking about? 

00:04:40
WIFE I mean, I don't know. Um, what if we took a thousand dollars from the money and invested it, put it in the bank, whatever you want to do with it. And then the other thousand dollars we put toward spending time together. So, may-, a trip, or dates or a-, anything where we're spending some time together. 

00:04:55
BEN Okay. Um, I, I guess it's easier to stomach doing something like that, so I guess I"d probably be okay doing that. But I just don't want to spend all the money and not invest any of it. 

00:05:05
WIFE And I don't, that's, I'm okay with that. I don't necessarily want to spend all of it. I just want some time with you. So. 

00:05:15
BEN Okay. 

00:05:15
WIFE I'd be fine to split it up if you are. 

00:05:15
BEN Okay. Yeah, uh, I'm okay with that. 

00:05:15
WIFE Okay. 

00:05:15
Homeostasis 

00:05:15
SAM GLADDING Homeostasis: like biological organisms, families and couples have a tendency to remain in a steady, stable state of equilibrium unless otherwise forced to change. When a member unbalances the family or couple through his or her action, other members of the partner/spouse system quickly try to rectify the situation through negative feedback. Sometimes homeostasis can be advantageous in helping a family or couple achieve life-cycle goals. But often it prevents moving on to another stage of development. 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:00
WIFE A little late, aren't we? 

00:06:10
BEN Seriously? 

00:06:10
WIFE Yeah. 

00:06:10
BEN It's, what, 7:15? 

00:06:15
WIFE On a Saturday. Yes, 7:15. We agreed we'd be up by 7. We have a schedule, Ben. 

00:06:20
BEN It's, it's Saturday. I mean, really. Like, we do this all week long. You're so rigid about ev-, absolutely everything that's gotta get taken care of. Why can't we just make it so that as long as we get the stuff done, then everything's okay? 

00:06:35
WIFE What do you mean? Just, uch, like all week long? I don't-- 

00:06:35
BEN Well, I mean all week long everything's so structured and organized and like maybe on the weekends we can actually just relax a little bit. I mean, I know everything's gotta get done and we'll do that, um, but I just don't understand why we've gotta wake up at 7 on Saturday, or why it's such a big deal. 

00:06:55
WIFE So you're saying you'll stick to our schedule during the week if on Saturday it's more flexible? 

00:07:00
BEN Yeah, I'll, I'm fine with that. 

00:07:00
WIFE And you'll still get the stuff done, just-- 

00:07:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:07:05
WIFE I, I guess on your own time? 

00:07:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:07:05
WIFE Okay. I could, I'm fine with that. 

00:07:10
BEN I mean, I know our whole goal was to try to go out on a date tonight and I still want to do that. That's important to me. I know it's important to you, too. Just as long as we get everything done, I just don't think we have to be so structured with everything. 

00:07:25
WIFE Well, I'm willing to give up the schedule on the weekend if we can have it during the week. 

00:07:30
BEN Okay. I'm fine with that. 

00:07:30
WIFE Okay. 

00:07:30
BEN That works for me. 

00:07:30
Nonsummativity 

00:07:30
DAWN CALHOUN The couple or family is greater than the sum of its parts. It is necessary to examine the patterns within a couple or a family rather than the actions of any specific member alone. For example, in this scenario, three sisters decide on how to go shopping. 

00:07:45
SISTER 1 Okay, so we have lots to do. 

00:07:50
SISTER 2 Yeah, we do. 

00:07:50
SISTER 1 Um, we need to get a gift for mom and dad for Christmas and I saw that we have this coupon, um, for the Pottery Barn. And so, um, we, I think we should go shopping today, but we need to see if Brittany can go. 

00:08:00
SISTER 2 Yeah, definitely. Cuz I know she had said she wanted to go another day, but-- 

00:08:05
SISTER 1 Oh. 

00:08:05
SISTER 2 I know. I have stuff I wanna do, too. 

00:08:05
SISTER 1 Okay. 

00:08:05
SISTER 2 So. Brittany, come on! 

00:08:10
SISTER 1 Brittany. 

00:08:10
BRITTANY Hey, what's up? 

00:08:10
SISTER 1 Do you want to go shopping today? 

00:08:15
BRITTANY Uch, wow, I hadn't really thought I would go today. I was thinking more next week, but, why, were you guys-- 

00:08:15
SISTER 1 I was thinking that we could get a gift for mom and dad and we're gonna need to be together to do that. 

00:08:20
SISTER 2 Yeah, and she has coupons, so she wants to go to the Pottery Barn, but I really want to go to Ann Taylor Loft because they're having a huge sale. 

00:08:30
BRITTANY Oh, they are? 

00:08:30
SISTER 2 And if we don't go today, they're gonna be sold out of everything. 

00:08:30
BRITTANY Okay. 

00:08:30
SISTER 2 So, I want to do that. She wants to do mom and dad, where we all have to go together. 

00:08:35
SISTER 1 Yeah. 

00:08:35
SISTER 2 And you want to do a separate day. 

00:08:35
BRITTANY Yeah. I guess that doesn't really make sense, though, cuz we're s-, using more gas and stuff like that, so-- 

00:08:40
SISTER 2 Yeah. I know. 

00:08:40
SISTER 1 And it would take more time to go later, too. 

00:08:45
BRITTANY That's true. 

00:08:45
SISTER 2 So we should all figure out a way we can just go today and just get everything done. 

00:08:45
BRITTANY Yeah. 

00:08:50
SISTER 1 Yeah, I think we can do more if we stay together. 

00:08:50
BRITTANY That's true. Yeah. 

00:08:50
SISTER 2 Yeah, I think so, too. 

00:08:50
BRITTANY Just get one trip and knock it out. 

00:08:55
SISTER 2 Yeah. 

00:08:55
SISTER 1 Yeah. 

00:08:55
SISTER 2 Definitely. 

00:08:55
BRITTANY That's a good plan. 

00:08:55
SISTER 1 Okay. 

00:08:55
BRITTANY Um, well what if we kind of started at Ann Taylor Loft and then worked our way to the Pottery Barn at the end? And that way, you know, we hit the sale kind of early, but the coupons will still be good before the end of the day. 

00:09:05
SISTER 1 That's true. That's, that's true. 

00:09:05
SISTER 2 How about what you wanted to do with going on, doing your own thing? 

00:09:10
BRITTANY Well, I can do that later maybe. After we've picked out the gift, cuz that's really important that we get that taken care of. 

00:09:15
SISTER 2 Okay. 

00:09:15
SISTER 1 Okay. So maybe we can park over here and then go to Ann Taylor Loft and then go to Pottery Barn and then maybe we could even shop for each other! 

00:09:25
BRITTANY That's a great idea! 

00:09:25
SISTER 2 That's a great idea, yeah! I think we'll get a lot done by all going together today. 

00:09:30
BRITTANY Okay, sounds good. 

00:09:30
SISTER 1 Okay, well let's go! 

00:09:30
BRITTANY Great! 

00:09:30
SISTER 2 Great! 

00:09:30
Equifinality 

00:09:30
SAM GLADDING Equifinality: the same origin may lead to different outcomes and the same outcome may result from different origins. Thus, the couple or family that experiences a natural disaster such as a tornado or fire may become stronger or weaker as a result. When they become stronger, this phenomenon is known as post-traumatic resilience. Therefore, interactional patterns rather than particular conditions or events should be focused on. 

00:10:05
SISTER 1 Oh, my gosh. I am so glad you two are okay. 

00:10:05
SISTER 2 I know, I know. I can't believe we made it out of there. 

00:10:15
SISTER 1 I know. That was just really scary. 

00:10:15
BRITTANY I can't even process, I mean I don't even know how it started, but a f-, whole building burned down. That's terrifying. 

00:10:20
SISTER 2 That's scary. 

00:10:20
SISTER 1 I just can't believe it. 

00:10:25
SISTER 2 I'm so glad we all made it out okay. 

00:10:25
BRITTANY I know. 

00:10:25
SISTER 1 I'm so glad you both are here and that we're together. And we lost a lot, but we're gonna be okay. 

00:10:30
BRITTANY I know. At least we have each other, and-- 

00:10:35
SISTER 2 Mm-hm. 

00:10:35
SISTER 1 Yeah. 

00:10:35
BRITTANY You know, all that stuff doesn't matter. That's, this is what matters. 

00:10:35
SISTER 1 Mm-hm. 

00:10:40
SISTER 2 Yeah. I feel so lucky to still have you guys. 

00:10:40
SISTER 1 Mm-hm. 

00:10:40
SISTER 2 We're all safe. I mean, some of the neighbors, you know, they were, they don't have anybody. Like Miss Johnson. I saw her sitting outside all by herself. 

00:10:50
SISTER 1 Oh! 

00:10:50
SISTER 2 She doens't have any family and she lost everything. 

00:10:50
BRITTANY Oh, man. 

00:10:50
SISTER 1 Mm. And she doesn't even have family close by, right? 

00:10:50
SISTER 2 Yeah, no. 

00:10:50
BRITTANY Yeah, I don't think so. 

00:10:50
SISTER 2 They're far away. 

00:11:00
SISTER 1 Mm. 

00:11:00
BRITTANY I can't imagine going through this alone. 

00:11:00
SISTER 2 I know. 

00:11:00
SISTER 1 Yeah. 

00:11:00
SISTER 2 I'm so glad I have you guys. 

00:11:05
SISTER 1 Mm-hm. I wonder if we could maybe go be with her, um. 

00:11:10
BRITTANY Yeah. That would-- 

00:11:10
SISTER 1 We could be her family for now since this is just so scary. 

00:11:15
SISTER 2 Yeah. We have each other so let's go help her. 

00:11:20
SISTER 1 Yeah. Let's do that. 

00:11:20
SISTER 2 Yeah. 

00:11:20
Morphogenesis 

00:11:20
DAWN CALHOUN Morphogenesis is the ability of the family or couple to modify their functioning to meet the changing demands of internal and external factors. Morphogenesis usually requires a second order change, which is the ability to make an entirely new response rather than a first order change, which is continuing to do more of the same things that have worked previously. Instead of just talking, family members or couples may need to try new ways of behaving like the following scene shows. 

00:11:45
BRITTANY Guys, I'm, I'm kind of nervous about this run. Remember last time we went a couple of days ago and there was that group of big dogs? 

00:11:55
SISTER 2 Oh, yeah. 

00:11:55
SISTER 1 Oh, yeah. You're right. 

00:12:00
SISTER 2 They were really scary. Oh. 

00:12:00
BRITTANY I know. I thought they were gonna bite us. 

00:12:00
SISTER 2 Yeah. 

00:12:00
BRITTANY They were chasing us pretty quickly. 

00:12:00
SISTER 1 And I think there were several of them, right? 

00:12:05
BRITTANY Yeah, it was-- 

00:12:05
SISTER 2 Yeah, there were a couple. 

00:12:05
BRITTANY At least three. 

00:12:05
SISTER 1 And they sounded really mean. 

00:12:10
BRITTANY I know. It was like that kind of like attack bark. 

00:12:10
SISTER 1 Yeah. 

00:12:10
BRITTANY Not just like a warning. 

00:12:15
SISTER 2 We're lucky we got away last time. 

00:12:15
SISTER 1 Yeah. 

00:12:15
BRITTANY Definitely. 

00:12:15
SISTER 2 Yeah. 

00:12:15
SISTER 1 We should try to figure out something else for this time. 

00:12:20
SISTER 2 Yeah. Definitely. 

00:12:20
BRITTANY What do you think we should do? 

00:12:20
SISTER 2 Well, remember, Dad always said we could, like, carry a water bottle-- 

00:12:25
SISTER 1 Well, yeah. 

00:12:25
SISTER 2 --and just kinda spray 'em? 

00:12:25
SISTER 1 No. 

00:12:25
BRITTANY Yeah, but I don't they know, I mean, they, they were pretty intense. I would almost feel better with, like, pepper spray. 

00:12:30
SISTER 1 Yeah. 

00:12:30
BRITTANY Rather than water. 

00:12:30
SISTER 1 Maybe we could, like, take treats or something and give them to them if they got close? 

00:12:35
SISTER 2 Yeah, we could. I don't know, though. Then they might run after us faster next time. 

00:12:40
BRITTANY Yeah. It's kinda like we're rewarding them for chasing us. 

00:12:40
SISTER 1 Oh, that's true. Sorry. 

00:12:40
BRITTANY Um, what if we, what if we threw sticks at them? 

00:12:45
SISTER 2 Yeah. 

00:12:45
SISTER 1 Oo! 

00:12:45
SISTER 2 Or we could just get a big stick and poke 'em. 

00:12:45
BRITTANY I don't want to get close enough to poke 'em. 

00:12:45
SISTER 1 Oh, me neither! 

00:12:45
SISTER 2 Alright, well, maybe run faster? 

00:12:55
SISTER 1 Uh, I, I don't know. Well, wait. What if we just chose a different street? 

00:13:00
SISTER 2 Oh! 

00:13:00
BRITTANY Well, that's not a bad idea. 

00:13:00
SISTER 2 We could do that. 

00:13:00
BRITTANY Mix up our route anyway. 

00:13:00
SISTER 1 Yeah! 

00:13:00
SISTER 2 Yeah! 

00:13:00
BRITTANY Change of pace. 

00:13:05
SISTER 1 It's more challenging anyway. 

00:13:05
SISTER 2 Definitely. 

00:13:05
BRITTANY I, there's that app, like MapMyRide? 

00:13:05
SISTER 1 Oh, yeah! Let's look at that! 

00:13:05
SISTER 2 Oh, cool! What is that? 

00:13:10
BRITTANY Okay. Oh, look! We can take Mulberry and then we still end up at the park. 

00:13:15
SISTER 2 Oh, yeah. 

00:13:15
BRITTANY If we go this way. 

00:13:15
SISTER 2 And we get an extra hill in that way, too. 

00:13:15
SISTER 1 Oh, man! 

00:13:15
BRITTANY Oh, great. 

00:13:15
SISTER 2 No, that's good! Yeah! Extra exercise. 

00:13:20
SISTER 1 Okay. 

00:13:20
BRITTANY Okay, you're right. 

00:13:20
SISTER 2 Great! Cool, guys! Let's go! 

00:13:20
BRITTANY All right. 

00:13:25
SISTER 1 Okay. 

00:13:25
SISTER 2 Cool. 

00:13:25
SAM GLADDING In addition to some universal aspects of family life, the process of marriage, couple, and family counseling is based on several premises. First, persons conducting counseling or therapy are psychologically healthy and understand their own families of origin well. When such is the case, counselors are able to clearly focus on their client families and not contaminate sessions with material from their own family life that they have not resolved. 

00:13:55
DAWN CALHOUN A second premise of working with families is that counselors will not over-emphasize or under-emphasize possible aspects of intervention in the therapeutic process. In other words, counselors will balance what they do. Such a process means not being overly concerned about making family members happy, but at the same time engaging members in a personable way. 

00:14:20
SAM GLADDING A third component of conducting marriage, couple, and family counseling is for the therapist to win the battle for structure, that is, establishing the perameters under which counseling is to be conducted while leaving the family to win the battle of initiative, that is, movitation to make needed changes. The battle for structure is won when counselors inform clients about ways they will work with them, including important but mundane facts about how often they will meet, for how long, and who is to be involved. Initiative in the therapeutic process must come from couples and families themselves. The couple or family members must pull together toward common goals. 

00:15:00
DAWN CALHOUN Finally, marriage, couple and family counselors need to be able to see the couple or family difficulties in the context in which they are occurring. Thus, the therapist needs to be developmentally sophisticated and see couples and families from different life stages, cultural norms, or situational circumstances.

00:15:25
Closure 

00:15:25
SAM GLADDING Given the premises we have talked about in regard to how families operate and the process of family counseling and therapy, let's look at three distinct stages of working with a family. These are the Initial Stage, the Middle Stage, and Closure.

Bowen Family Work

Structural Family Therapy 

00:15:40
STRATEGIC FAMILY THERAPY 

00:15:40
SOLUTION-FOCUSED FAMILY THERAPY 

00:15:40
NARRATIVE THERAPY 

00:15:40
SAM GLADDING In examining these stages, we will also look at some of the main techniques used in five popular approaches to family therapy: Bowen Family Work, Structural Family Therapy, Strategic Family Therapy, Solution-Focused Family Therapy, and Narrative Therapy. We will illustrate these stages and some of the more popular techniques in working with families with a multi-generational family, the Joneses, consisting of a husband, Brian, in his early 30's, his wife, Jenny, in her mid-20's, and a mother-in-law, Edna, in her 50's. This family configuration is only one of many we could use. The stages they go through and the methods that are illustrated, though, are applicable for a wide variety of families. 

00:16:30
DAWN CALHOUN To set the scene for this family session: a newly married couple, Brian and Jenny, live with the husband's mother, Edna. The arrangement is one that is based on necessity. However, friction, anxiety, and depression are part of the household. Triangulation and scapegoating are present as the husband, Brian, and his mother, Edna, form an intergenerational coalition and attack the wife, Jenny, for one, not being a good housekeeper, and the mother-in-law leads in the attack; two, for being career-focused; and three, not immediately wanting to have children. 

00:17:05
Establish rapport 

00:17:05
Open-ended questions 

00:17:05
Observe 'family dance' 

00:17:05
DAWN CALHOUN In this initial session the therapist focusses on doing a number of crucial things: establishing rapport, using open-ended questions, and observing the 'family dance,' that is, redundancies in how the family acts. 

00:17:15
Reframe the situation 

00:17:15
Unify couple/Interrupt Triangulation 

00:17:15
Homework 

00:17:15
DAWN CALHOUN The counselor also strives to bring about a change in perception through reframing so the situation becomes solvable, unify the couple and interrupt triangulation, and instill hope through assigning homework. 

00:17:30
SAM GLADDING It's good to see you here. I know that, uh, coming as a family to counseling is not always an easy thing to do. And there's a lot of work that's involved in this, but I'd like for you to feel as comfortable as possible as we proceed. I know a little bit about each of you from the information I've read on intake sheets, but I'd like to know a little more about you, so let me ask you just a few questions. And if it's all right, I'll call you by your first names. Uh, Brian, tell me about yourself. 

00:18:10
BRIAN Well, I'm a teller at First National downtown. I've been there about eight years. Uh, I enjoy my job. I like working with the people there, and, yeah. It's a good job. 

00:18:20
SAM GLADDING Okay. So that's a very demanding job, but a good job. 

00:18:20
BRIAN A good job. 

00:18:25
SAM GLADDING Yeah. And Jenny? 

00:18:25
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:18:25
SAM GLADDING How about yourself? What do you do? 

00:18:25
JENNY I'm a fourth grade teacher at an elementary school, but I'm also going to classes after school at night, um, for a degree in Administration. I want to be a principle eventually. 

00:18:35
BRIAN Wow. 

00:18:40
JENNY Yeah. 

00:18:40
SAM GLADDING That's quite an ambitious goal and-- 

00:18:40
JENNY Yeah! 

00:18:40
SAM GLADDING It's quite a demanding schedule that you have. 

00:18:45
JENNY It is. Yeah. It's a busy day. 

00:18:45
SAM GLADDING Right. 

00:18:45
JENNY Yeah. 

00:18:45
SAM GLADDING And Edna, tell me what you do. 

00:18:50
EDNA I work at a bank also. I'm a process improvement manager, ahem, in the, uh, Support Services Organization. 

00:18:55
BRIAN And what's a process improvement manager? I'm not sure I know what that is. 

00:19:00
EDNA That's someone who, um, leads teams to help the bank figure out how to do things more efficiently. 

00:19:10
SAM GLADDING Mm. 

00:19:10
EDNA To save money. 

00:19:10
SAM GLADDING So that's a very demanding job also. 

00:19:10
EDNA It is. People hate to change. Mm-hm. 

00:19:15
SAM GLADDING Right. People hate to change. And I think that's probably, may be true for families, uh, as well as individuals. 

00:19:20
ENDA Mm. 

00:19:20
SAM GLADDING But, um, tell me what has brought you to counseling. Again, I've read some material, but I'd like to hear it from you. What, what brought you here? 

00:19:30
BRIAN Well, Jenny's not happy with our current living situation. 

00:19:35
JENNY Mm. 

00:19:35
BRIAN Yeah. 

00:19:35
SAM GLADDING So you came because Jenny's not happy? 

00:19:40
BRIAN Yeah. I think, yeah. 

00:19:45
SAM GLADDING And-- 

00:19:45
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:19:45
SAM GLADDING And Jenny. 

00:19:45
JENNY Yeah? 

00:19:45
SAM GLADDING Tell me about that. 

00:19:45
JENNY Um, well, we live with Edna, which is great, um, but we have been married for six months and I would like a little more time with Brian, um, maybe separate from Edna, as well as our family time all together. Um, and I feel criticized by Edna sometimes. 

00:20:05
SAM GLADDING Huh. 

00:20:05
JENNY And I would prefer not to. 

00:20:05
SAM GLADDING Okay. So you'd like more time-- 

00:20:10
JENNY Yeah. 

00:20:10
SAM GLADDING Uh, with, uh, your husband. 

00:20:10
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:20:15
SAM GLADDING And you'd really like to have less critism. 

00:20:15
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:20:15
SAM GLADDING Okay. 

00:20:15
JENNY Yeah. 

00:20:15
SAM GLADDING And Edna, uh, what brought you here? Why did you come? 

00:20:25
EDNA Well, I didn't think we needed to come, but Brian begged me to and so I came. 

00:20:30
SAM GLADDING Okay. So you're not sure why you're here except your son asked you to come? 

00:20:35
EDNA Yeah. 

00:20:35
SAM GLADDING And so you did. 

00:20:35
EDNA That's right. 

00:20:35
SAM GLADDING Yeah. So let's look at, um, what we can define just a little better in terms of goals. So, um, Brian, what, what couple goals might you have? What, what goals might you have for you and Jenny and what might you have for the family, since you're all a family? What might those goals be? 

00:21:00
BRIAN I think the goal that Jenny mentioned is that we'd like to spend more time together. Um, and as a family I just want us all to get along. 

00:21:10
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:21:10
SAM GLADDING Okay. So you'd like to spend more time and you'd like to get along better as, as a family. 

00:21:15
BRIAN Mm-hm. 

00:21:15
SAM GLADDING And Jenny? How about you? 

00:21:20
JENNY I would say very similar goals. I would like more time with Brian and then, um, I care about Edna, and so I would like to get along better with her. 

00:21:25
SAM GLADDING Okay. You'd like to get along better with her and-- 

00:21:30
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:21:30
SAM GLADDING you'd like to have more time with Brian. Edna, I know you came because Brian asked you, but since you're here, do you have, what goals might you have? 

00:21:40
EDNA Well, I would like it if, um, Jenny did a better job of her household chores. I mean the floors look a mess, and she doesn't change the sheets often enough, and, you know, it's, I'm providing the house. It's a nice house. I'd like for it to look nice. 

00:22:00
SAM GLADDING Mm. So you'd like some changes in Jenny. 

00:22:00
EDNA Yeah. 

00:22:00
SAM GLADDING Oh, okay. 

00:22:05
EDNA Yeah. 

00:22:05
SAM GLADDING So, um, what you hear that-- 

00:22:05
JENNY Mm. 

00:22:10
SAM GLADDING Jenny, what's your reaction? 

00:22:10
JENNY Um, definitely hurt. And, um, I feel like some of my efforts are ignored. 

00:22:20
SAM GLADDING Okay. Okay. So hurt and feeling like you, you're not appreciated. 

00:22:25
JENNY Yeah. 

00:22:25
SAM GLADDING As much. 

00:22:25
JENNY Yeah. 

00:22:25
SAM GLADDING And Brian, what do you hear when you hear that? 

00:22:30
BRIAN Well, I, I just know that there's some disagreement between the two of them and I just want Jenny to, you know, do things that don't aggravate my mother. 

00:22:40
SAM GLADDING Uh huh. Okay, so you'd like some more harmony and, uh, less aggravation. 

00:22:45
BRIAN Yes. 

00:22:45
SAM GLADDING Okay. So let me, let me get a kind of an idea of what happens at your house at particular times of day. Um, one of the things that I'd like to kind of know is, um, what happens, like after dinner, uh, on a typical day when you, when you would eat dinner together? 

00:23:10
JENNY Well, usually, I'm the one that's making the dinner and cleaning it up, and, um, sometimes I ask Edna, but she usually doesn't really want to help me. And Brian usually goes and hangs out cuz he's had a long day and, Enda, um, ends up hanging out somewhere, too, or working in her office or something. So I'm left to do the chores, part of it. 

00:23:35
SAM GLADDING Okay, so you do the chores and then Edna and Brian do something else. 

00:23:40
JENNY Yeah. 

00:23:40
SAM GLADDING Yeah. 

00:23:45
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:23:45
SAM GLADDING And Brian, uh, how do you see it? Uh, both for yourself and what happens with, Edna and Jenny? 

00:23:50
BRIAN Well, I just don't want to get in the way. I know that, that Jenny needs to clean up after dinner and I, I've heard grumblings of her needing help from Mom, but, yeah, usually she does a good job about clearing the table. 

00:24:05
SAM GLADDING Mm-hm. And what do, uh, so if she cleans and what do you and your mother do? 

00:24:10
BRIAN Well, I, I think I know my mom works hard at her job and she usually has to go back and rest after a long day, after the meal, so, yeah. 

00:24:20
SAM GLADDING Okay, so she, so both of you leave the table. 

00:24:25
BRIAN I think so. That's, that's how it's been. 

00:24:25
SAM GLADDING Yeah. 

00:24:25
BRIAN Most recently. 

00:24:25
SAM GLADDING And Edna? How about you? 

00:24:30
EDNA Yeah. I mean, I often have to do another couple of hours of work after I get home. And so, Jenny gets out of school at 2:30 or 3 o'clock, so she's had time to recoup, so. That's my time to go home, I mean go up to my office and just get some more work done and just, get some more work done and just relax. 

00:24:50
SAM GLADDING So you think it's Jenny's responsibility and, uh, how about with Brian? 

00:25:00
EDNA Um, well, you know, Brian lost his dad when he was young, so, um, he's just kinda got the man's role, and, I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. 

00:25:10
SAM GLADDING Haven't really thought about what he should do? How, how would it be, um, Brian, if you did help some? 

00:25:20
BRIAN Well, she'd probably like that. Um. 

00:25:20
JENNY Yeah. 

00:25:25
BRIAN Yeah. 

00:25:25
SAM GLADDING It sounds like Jenny feels a bit overwhelmed. 

00:25:30
BRIAN Yeah. 

00:25:30
JENNY Yes. 

00:25:30
SAM GLADDING Um, with all the responsibility that's, that's there. 

00:25:35
JENNY Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:25:35
SAM GLADDING Yeah. So, if, you think-- 

00:25:35
JENNY I do. I think it would help a lot because I have stuff I have to do after work, too. And, I mean, I have school work for myself, um, and then lesson plans and things. And so, definitely overwhelmed and definitely could use extra help. 

00:25:50
SAM GLADDING Mm. Mm. Mm. So, uh, if you got some help you would, you would be ha-, happier. 

00:25:55
JENNY I think so. 

00:26:00
SAM GLADDING Yeah. I'd like to, um, have you do something, uh, for me, and that is, um, uh, Edna, would you change places with Jenny here for a minute? [sil.] Yeah. I'd just like to see the two of you as a couple since you are married, and, uh, how does, how does this configuration look to you, Brian? 

00:26:30
BRIAN Well, it's, it's a little, well, it's natural, um, we are married so it's good to be next to my wife here. 

00:26:35
SAM GLADDING Okay. So that feels a little better? 

00:26:35
BRIAN Mm-hm. 

00:26:35
JENNY Mm. 

00:26:35
SAM GLADDING And Jenny? 

00:26:40
JENNY Um, it's a little more like it should be, I think. Yeah, it feels more connected and Edna's still here, but we're connected on this side. 

00:26:45
SAM GLADDING So you're more connected. 

00:26:50
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:26:50
BRIAN Mm-hm. 

00:26:50
SAM GLADDING Edna, how is it for you? 

00:26:50
EDNA I think they make quite the lovely couple. 

00:26:55
SAM GLADDING So you really like the way they look? 

00:27:00
EDNA Yeah. 

00:27:00
SAM GLADDING Together. They are a handsome couple. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think there's some things that we could do, uh, in, uh, the upcoming time. And I'd like to see you for awhile. It may not take forever. In fact, I think we could probably limit this to 10 sessions so we could focus on what, uh, you want to do in your lives. But I'd like to give you a homework assignment since we only have an hour together when we're here. So. 

00:27:30
JENNY Okay. 

00:27:30
SAM GLADDING Would that be okay? 

00:27:35
JENNY Mm. Mm-hm. 

00:27:35
SAM GLADDING Work? Okay. So the homework assignment would be this: that I'd like for each of you to keep notes, uh, on what happens after dinner for this next week, and how you feel about that. So it's an observation and then a feeling about how that's going. 

00:27:55
JENNY 'Kay. 

00:27:55
SAM GLADDING Um, and don't share it with each other, uh, because I'd like for you to bring it in. And I'd like to see how similar or dissimilar your, um, notes are to one another. 

00:28:10
JENNY 'Kay 

00:28:10
SAM GLADDING And, uh. 

00:28:10
JENNY Mm. 

00:28:10
SAM GLADDING And what you might want to do a-, uh, after that, having read your notes. 

00:28:15
JENNY 'Kay. 

00:28:15
SAM GLADDING Okay? 

00:28:15
JENNY Yeah. 

00:28:15
SAM GLADDING As we look at 'em together. 

00:28:20
JENNY Sounds good. 

00:28:20
SAM GLADDING Okay? So let's plan to meet at this time next week? 

00:28:25
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:28:25
SAM GLADDING And we will go from there. 

00:28:25
JENNY Okay. 

00:28:25
EDNA Okay. 

00:28:25
SAM GLADDING Okay? 

00:28:25
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:28:25
SAM GLADDING Good. Good to see you. 

00:28:30
JENNY Thanks. 

00:28:30
BRIAN Thank you. 

00:28:30
EDNA Thank you. 

00:28:30
DAWN CALHOUN During the middle or working phase, after rapport has been established and the counselor has seen the 'family dance,' the major work of couple and family therapy begins. Major therapeutic approaches, both systemic and non-systemic, have various emphasis for helping families. However, outside of their philosophies, many approaches have common techniques. Some of the most prevalent of them are demonstrated here. 

00:28:55
Modeling and teaching clear communication skills 

00:28:55
DAWN CALHOUN The first is modeling and teaching clear communication skills. Couples often have trouble because they do not have good models to follow, or they do not communicate their ideas clearly. They can overcome communication by listening to what they are saying and making connections if needed. 

00:29:15
SAM GLADDING So last week I asked you to do, record, um, some notes about what happens after dinner. And I see you've all done that. 

00:29:20
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:29:20
SAM GLADDING And so I'm wondering if you can give me an instance of, uh, something that occurred, uh, after dinner? 

00:29:30
BRIAN Well, uh, what happened after dinner the last night that we wrote everything down is the floor was pretty dirty, so I immediately said, "Shouldn't someone clean the floor?" 

00:29:40
JENNY And then I said, "Maybe someone else could do that?" 

00:29:40
SAM GLADDING Oh. So who was "someone" and who was "someone else" and how did the floor get cleaned? 

00:29:50
BRIAN Well, Jenny is someone. 

00:29:50
JENNY Yeah. I'm "someone" and he's "someone else." 

00:29:55
SAM GLADDING Mm. 

00:29:55
JENNY Yeah. 

00:29:55
SAM GLADDING Yeah. So how'd the floor get cleaned? 

00:30:00
BRIAN Well, we finally said, or, if this is something that we have down is "I see the floor needs sweeping. Uh, is that something you can do while I clean the windows?" 

00:30:05
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:30:05
SAM GLADDING Oh. 

00:30:10
BRIAN And that seemed to work. 

00:30:10
JENNY That worked a little better. Yeah. 

00:30:10
SAM GLADDING So you divided the task and it got done. 

00:30:15
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:30:15
SAM GLADDING Okay. That sounds good. 

00:30:15
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:30:15
Focusing on strengths/Shaping competence 

00:30:15
DAWN CALHOUN They also need to focus on strengths and shaping their competence. Most people want to become more competent and they do. However, strong couple and marriage relationships are usually built on strengths. In this scenario, see how using strengths can make a difference. 

00:30:30
SAM GLADDING You've told me some of the things that happened last week when you were making your notes about what occurred after dinner. I'm wondering what else, uh, happened? 

00:30:45
BRIAN Well, I had torn a button off my shirt at work going into the cash drawer, and I'm a clutz with a needle, so I asked Jenny if she could sew it on for me. 

00:30:50
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:30:55
EDNA And I'm good at sewing and Brian's better with tools so I sewed on the button while he fixed our leaky faucet. Mm-hm. 

00:31:00
EDNA And I offered to help cuz I've sewn on many buttons and I watched my husband fix many faucets. 

00:31:05
JENNY Mm-hm. And that made me feel better when she did that. 

00:31:05
SAM GLADDING It sounds like you were really a team, uh, with sewing and with tools and, uh, with kind of a utility helper there who could give some guidance along the way. 

00:31:20
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:31:20
Using Humor 

00:31:20
DAWN CALHOUN Another technique is using humor. Using humor in treatment to promote change can make a positive difference. As Paul Watzlawick used to say, "the situation is hopeless, but not serious." Humor can be seen in the following mother-in-law and daughter interaction with the family counselor. 

00:31:40
EDNA I tell you, if you repeat that behavior one more time, I will just die! 

00:31:45
JENNY No you won't. You're just trying to make me feel guilty. 

00:31:50
SAM GLADDING Sounds like you've been on this guilt trip before. 

00:31:50
JENNY Mm-hm. Yeah she says that a lot and then she never dies and I just get mad and frustrated. 

00:31:55
SAM GLADDING Mm. 

00:31:55
EDNA I tell you, if you do it again, I will die. 

00:32:00
SAM GLADDING So your daugther-in-law is pretty powerful? 

00:32:05
EDNA Yes. 

00:32:05
SAM GLADDING And if she does this behavior that she's, that you're talking about you just feel like you'll, you'll die? 

00:32:10
EDNA Yes. 

00:32:10
SAM GLADDING Mm. Well, I, I wonder, Jenny, you, you've said that you really love your, your mother-in-law. 

00:32:20
JENNY Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:32:20
SAM GLADDING That you care about her. I wonder, and you don't want any harm to come to her, necessarily, so, I wonder how it would be if, uh, instead of killing her with this behavior, if you'd just paralyze this arm? 

00:32:35
EDNA What?! 

00:32:35
JENNY Well, I don't know that I'm strong enough to paralyze one of Edna's arms, but I think if I could just do what I want to do and Edna would stop harping on me, then it would give me a chance to live my life. 

00:32:45
SAM GLADDING So if you could do the behavior like you'd like to do without her criticizing you-- 

00:32:50
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:32:50
SAM GLADDING --then, uh, all would be well, and maybe here's a chance now in this next week for, for you to do, to do that and for you not to get your arm paralyzed, let alone die. 

00:33:05
[sil.] 

00:33:05
Using directives and ordeals 

00:33:05
DAWN CALHOUN Also, using directives and ordeals: counselors can use paradox to get families to do what they want them to do, such as telling a family that is resistant to change to "go slow." In such a case, the family resistance is to go faster. However, therapists should never use paradox when a directive or an ordeal can be used. Let's watch and see. 

00:33:25
BRIAN Well, I just want to yell at Jenny when she doesn't communicate with me. She seems to get angry and doesn't say why. 

00:33:35
SAM GLADDING So you really feel like yelling? Um-- 

00:33:35
BRIAN I do. Yeah. 

00:33:40
SAM GLADDING Yeah. And, so here's what I'd like for you to do before you do that. I'd like for you to do 50 pushups or I'd like for you to take a 15-minute shower before you yell at anyone. 

00:33:55
BRIAN Okay. 

00:33:55
SAM GLADDING Okay? 

00:33:55
BRIAN I'll do that. 

00:33:55
SAM GLADDING Okay. 

00:33:55
Working with interaction 

00:34:00
DAWN CALHOUN Also, working with interaction: families are often spontaneous in their interactions. When they are and the action that is generated is positive, it should be made the most of. Consider what happens here. 

00:34:15
EDNA Jenny, you know the kitchen looked really awful a--gain. 

00:34:15
SAM GLADDING What'd you just do? 

00:34:20
EDNA I stopped myself. 

00:34:20
SAM GLADDING By? 

00:34:20
EDNA Snapping my fingers. 

00:34:20
SAM GLADDING Like that? 

00:34:25
EDNA Yeah. 

00:34:25
SAM GLADDING Yeah. So that's a sign for you to stop criticizing 

00:34:30
EDNA Criticizing. 

00:34:30
SAM GLADDING Yeah. So could it be a universal sign that Jenny and Brian would pick up, too? 

00:34:35
EDNA Yeah. 

00:34:35
SAM GLADDING So how would you want them to respond when you snap? 

00:34:40
EDNA So if I snap, they snap back. 

00:34:40
SAM GLADDING Like that? 

00:34:40
EDNA That's good. 

00:34:40
SAM GLADDING Okay. So that'll work for stopping criticizm regardless of whoever's doing it. Right? 

00:34:50
EDNA Right. 

00:34:50
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:34:50
SAM GLADDING Try one more time. Good. It's a snap. 

00:34:50
Making boundaries 

00:35:00
DAWN CALHOUN Making boundaries: sometimes making boundaries is done through intensifying messages or f-, clarifying questions. Boundaries can make a difference in families. They define interpersonal and personal relationships. If boundaries are clear and well-defined, families function better. 

00:35:15
SAM GLADDING So Brian, you have these two important women in your life. 

00:35:20
BRIAN Yes. 

00:35:20
SAM GLADDING Tell me about them. 

00:35:20
BRIAN Well, I, I love them both. Yes. 

00:35:25
SAM GLADDING And tell me, tell me more. 

00:35:30
BRIAN Well, they, they have enhanced my life in different ways. My mother, uh, she's raised me. She's given me a great foundation, but she is my mother. Um, I have a wife now, and she's my partner, and, uh, we just need to spend more time together. Yes. 

00:35:40
SAM GLADDING Okay. 

00:35:40
Using genograms 

00:35:40
DAWN CALHOUN A genogram: a genogram is a diagram of one's family history going back at least the-, three generations. This can give family members into what they think and behave as they do. Although originally generated by Murray Bowen and used in Bowen Family Therapy, genograms may be used by therapists from a number of different orientations. They may be especially powerful when families and their members have ample time to complete them, such as if they occur when they are assigned as homework. 

00:36:10
SAM GLADDING So last time I asked you if you would do a genogram as part of your homework. And I see you've brought in a very comprehensive genogram. So I'm wondering what you've learned from having done this exercise, and maybe, Edna, maybe we could start with you. 

00:36:30
EDNA Okay. Um, I'm right here. As you can see, I'm the oldest of five children. 

00:36:35
SAM GLADDING Mm-hm. 

00:36:35
EDNA Um, my father was an alc-, alcoholic and he was abusive. 

00:36:40
SAM GLADDING Mm. 

00:36:40
EDNA And my mother divorced him when I was 12. So I had to take on a lot of the r-, chores, help with, um, cleaning the house. 

00:36:50
SAM GLADDING Mm. 

00:36:50
EDNA Um, so I've worked, I know hard work. I've done it since the time I was a child. And now, I'm tired. 

00:37:00
SAM GLADDING Right. 

00:37:00
EDNA You know? 

00:37:00
SAM GLADDING Right. So y, from this you, you kind of realize even more strongly that you've, uh, really been working all of your life. 

00:37:10
EDNA Mm. 

00:37:10
SAM GLADDING And had a lot of responsibility for others and that hard work, uh, and that ethic of hard work is really something that's very powerful in your life. And now that you've gotten a little older you feel like, "Oh, I deserve some rest." 

00:37:25
EDNA That's right. 

00:37:30
JENNY Mm. Right. 

00:37:30
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:37:30
SAM GLADDING Yeah. Jenny? What, what did you learn? 

00:37:30
JENNY Well, um, I am the youngest of three and my mom's a single mom, um, so growing up I really didn't have to learn as many housework skills, I guess, as Edna sounds like she had to learn? Um, but the lesson that my mom really taught us, um, the value of career and getting a career and working hard at it and keeping it and, um, so that's really what I, where I come from. 

00:37:55
SAM GLADDING Okay, so that, that message that your mom gave you of get a career-- 

00:38:00
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:38:00
SAM GLADDING Maybe that influences the drive that you have toward education and-- 

00:38:05
JENNY Yeah. 

00:38:05
SAM GLADDING For furthering your career. 

00:38:10
JENNY Yeah. 

00:38:10
SAM GLADDING Brian? 

00:38:10
BRIAN I've noticed that my mother and I share, uh, banking in our background and, uh, one of my uncles also was in banking. Um, I do have a younger brother. He hasn't done anything with his life yet. Um, I think he's still finding his way, and maybe he'll find something in banking. 

00:38:30
SAM GLADDING Mm. Mm. 

00:38:30
JENNY Hm. 

00:38:30
SAM GLADDING So you've, you've noticed a common career path that, uh, you've taken and maybe that's been one of those things that's brought you together, made you closer? 

00:38:40
BRIAN Most definitely. 

00:38:40
SAM GLADDING Yeah. Especially since your younger brother hasn't uh, matured yet-- 

00:38:45
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:38:45
BRIAN Right. 

00:38:45
SAM GLADDING Into finding a career. 

00:38:50
BRIAN Yes. 

00:38:50
JENNY Yeah. 

00:38:50
SAM GLADDING Yeah. 

00:38:50
JENNY Yeah. 

00:38:50
SAM GLADDING So the genoram sounds like it's, uh, given you all some insight that you didn't have before. 

00:38:55
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:38:55
EDNA Yeah. 

00:38:55
JENNY Yeah. It explains a little bit more why we do the things that we do, I think. 

00:39:00
SAM GLADDING Well, I'd like for us to explore this more and one of the things I'm gonna ask you to do is to keep looking at this as we continue our sessions and see what other patterns or awarenesses, uh, come to mind as you-- 

00:39:15
JENNY Uh-huh. 

00:39:15
SAM GLADDING Uh, explore this. 

00:39:20
JENNY Yeah. 

00:39:20
SAM GLADDING Okay? 

00:39:20
JENNY That sounds good. 

00:39:20
BRIAN Sounds good. 

00:39:20
SAM GLADDING Great. 

00:39:25
DAWN CALHOUN Closure, or termination is or can be a time of celebration when the family realizes what they have accomplished. One way of conducting closure is for the therapist to summarize what has happened in the process of counseling. Another is for the family to do so and let the counselor know what they have learned. A third way of conducting closure is for the counselor and for the family to mutually engage in this process. This third approach is demonstrated here. 

00:39:50
Deciding on long-term goals 

00:39:50
SAM GLADDING In termination, deciding on long-term goals is crucial. This projective process gives couples and family members something to think about and plan out. 

00:40:00
Predicting setbacks 

00:40:00
SAM GLADDING A part of many termination sessions involves predicting setbacks, so that couples and families do not become too upset when they fail to achieve their goals as planned. 

00:40:15
Follow-up 

00:40:15
DAWN CALHOUN A final part of termination is follow-up. Follow-up conveys care and lets couples and families know they can return to counseling to finish anything they began there or to work on other issues. Client couples and families often do better when they have follow-up because they are aware that their progress is being monitored both from within and outside the context in which they live. 

00:40:40
SAM GLADDING So this is our last session together. And it seems like to me that you've all been working hard on being a family, but in a new way. And so I'm wondering if you can kind of summarize for me some of what you've learned during our times together? Brian? 

00:41:00
BRIAN Well, I've learned that we work best when we actually establish separate times for us being a couple and family time. Um, it's not good to repeat the same things over again. And I've learned that it's, makes life more fun when we're not repeating our old ways. Um, Mom and Jenny can go out and shop or trade recipes and not be critical of one another. And Jenny and I can go to a movie or a concert and not have to be feeling guilty about leaving Mom behind. 

00:41:25
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:41:25
SAM GLADDING Mm-hm. So you and Jenny are closer. 

00:41:30
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:41:30
SAM GLADDING Jenny and your mom are closer. 

00:41:30
JENNY Yeah. 

00:41:30
SAM GLADDING And as a group you're closer. 

00:41:35
JENNY Yeah. 

00:41:35
BRIAN Yes. 

00:41:35
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:41:40
SAM GLADDING Jenny? 

00:41:40
JENNY I think I've learned that, um, we can make gradual improvements in our lives by focusing on what it would take to get there and it's really important to have a vision of what we want and a goal in mind. 

00:41:50
SAM GLADDING Mm-hm. 

00:41:50
JENNY Mm. 

00:41:50
SAM GLADDING So the change is gradual. 

00:41:55
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:41:55
SAM GLADDING But if you have a vision-- 

00:41:55
JENNY Yeah. 

00:41:55
SAM GLADDING Of what it can be, you can get there. 

00:42:00
JENNY Yeah. 

00:42:00
SAM GLADDING Yeah. That sounds good. 

00:42:00
JENNY Yeah. 

00:42:00
SAM GLADDING Edna? 

00:42:05
EDNA Well, I think I've come away from this know that I don't have to be in control of Brian and Jenny and their interactions. 

00:42:10
SAM GLADDING Mm-hm. 

00:42:10
EDNA That just creates dissatisfaction and I'm determined to defeat dissatisfaction. 

00:42:15
SAM GLADDING Mm-hm. 

00:42:20
EDNA Um, so I'm really closer to them, but in a healthier way. 

00:42:25
JENNY Mm. 

00:42:25
EDNA And, um, I recognize that they're different from me and we're still connected, though. 

00:42:30
SAM GLADDING Mm-hm. So you've been able to give up control, relax more, have a more authentic relationship with, uh, your daughter-in-law and a different relationship, uh, with your son. And I also hear, not just from you, but from Brian that guilt is no longer a, uh, something that binds you together. 

00:42:55
JENNY Yeah. 

00:42:55
SAM GLADDING It's more, uh, relationships that are real. 

00:43:00
JENNY Yeah. 

00:43:00
SAM GLADDING I'm really glad to hear what you're saying because I do think you've worked hard. I want you to know that sometimes people can slip back into old patterns. I don't think that would be the case with you, but I would like to follow up with you in a couple of months. 

00:43:20
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:43:20
SAM GLADDING And see how things are going. I think if we can make an appointment for a couple of months out, then we can do some follow-up. And after that, if everything's still going the way it's going now, that, uh, you would be on your own in regard to not having this, uh, relationship with me-- 

00:43:40
JENNY Mm-hm. 

00:43:40
SAM GLADDING Uh, anymore, as it's been. But I think you've done really good work. And I think you're well on your way to a healthy relationship as a couple, and as a family. And, uh, I congratulate you on that. So, uh, if we could meet in a couple of months, how would that be? 

00:44:00
JENNY That sounds good. 

00:44:00
EDNA That's good. 

00:44:00
BRIAN Sounds good. 

00:44:05
JENNY Yeah. 

00:44:05
SAM GLADDING Okay. Uh, good. Well, I will look forward to seeing you then. And I want you to know I've really enjoyed working with you and I congratulate you on the good work you've done. 

00:44:15
JENNY Thank you. 

00:44:15
EDNA Thanks. 

00:44:15
BRIAN Thank you. 

00:44:20
SAM GLADDING Family counseling and therapy can make a positive difference in the lives of couples and families. By understanding how families function, and how they communicate, make rules and change, counselors and therapists can help make their lives better. 

00:44:35
DAWN CALHOUN There are numerous techniques that go with the process of family work. Engaging the family is crucial as is proper termination. However, the work in between helping family members be clear in their communication with one another, play to strengths, promote levity when appropriate, and use therapeutic directives that bring people together are important. Likewise, helping families understand boundary issues and even their past through the use of genograms can be transformative. 

00:45:00
SAM GLADDING Working with families is a challenge, but one that is worth it. From all of us who worked to bring you this video we wish you well as you move forward in helping families be better yet.
