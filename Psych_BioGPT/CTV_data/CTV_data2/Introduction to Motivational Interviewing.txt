Introduction to Motivational Interviewing with James (Diego) Rogers Psy.D. and Ian Schere, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
James (Diego) Rogers, Psy.D., MINT 

00:00:35
DR. JAMES ROGERS Hi, I'm Doctor James Rogers. I was trained as a clinical psychologist and I became a member of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers in 2004. 

00:00:40
Ian Schere, Ph.D., MINT 

00:00:40
DR. IAN SCHERE Hi, my name is Dr. Ian Schere. I'm a licensed clinical psychologist, and I became a member of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers in 2008. 

00:00:50
-Spirit -Principles -Practice 

00:00:55
DR. IAN SCHERE In this video you're going to learn about the fundamental approach of movitational interviewing, the fundamental spirit and some of its guiding principles. 

00:01:00
DR. JAMES ROGERS In this video, you'll also see examples of motivational interviewing used in practice. 

00:01:05
What is Motivational Interviewing? A collaborative, person-centered conversation to elicit and strengthen motivation for change Addresses the issue of ambivalence to change 

00:01:05
DR. IAN SCHERE Motivational interviewing is a person-centered collaborative conversation used to elicit and strengthen a person's motivation for change. So one of the aspects of motivational interviewing is the spirit of motivational interviewing or the spirit of MI. And we know that one of the important aspects in helping people to make desired changes is not just the techniques we use but the overall approach we take to the conversation. 

00:01:35
MI Spirit Collaborative Evocative Respectful Compassionate 

00:01:35
DR. IAN SCHERE We know that by having conversation that's marked with collaboration, respect, and often with the aspect of trying to elicit the ideas and the feelings and the values from the person you're talking to more so than suggesting things yourself is incredibly important in helping people to make these changes that they're trying to make. 

00:01:55
DR. JAMES ROGERS So another way to look at the MI spirit is that of using the metaphor of a guide. The provider takes on the role of helping to guide the client while the client equally is part of the journey and is walking for themselves rather than taking a more directive or authoritarian stance. Additionally, we look at the MI spirit as using the metaphor of looking at the client as either having an empty glass of water that requires us to fill it versus being a wishing well with its own water source. And our role there then is to help evoke and pull from the client their ideas and needs on how they would go about change. 

00:02:30
DR. IAN SCHERE Typically, when people are accepted for who they are and that what they're doing, even if those current behaviors aren't optimal. By being accepted, they're allowed to have the freedom to consider or not whether they want to make a change as opposed to feeling a need to defend what they're already doing because they were sensitive to judgement from other people. 

00:02:50
DR. JAMES ROGERS Motivational interviewing was born out of the substance abuse arena. However, today it's generally accepted that motivational interviewing is best used for ambivalence to behavior change in general and it could be used in a whole series of problem areas. 

00:03:05
Dr. Schere and Connor 

00:03:10
DR. IAN SCHERE Well, Connor, it's nice to see you again. Last time we met I remember we were talking a bit about your smoking cigarettes and your considering the idea of trying to cut back or quitting. Uhm, how's it been going? 

00:03:25
CONNOR Honestly, it's been getting progessively worse. Like, I don't know. It seems like every time I, you know, every day I'm always like smoking more and like, you know, like, six months ago I was, you know, barely, like thinking about it. And now I'm just thinking about it all the time. And, I mean, like I want to quit, you know, like for my health reasons and stuff. Like, I've been getting to like, see some, like, negative side effects, you know, like, I get, like angry you know, when I don't have them. And then like, you know, my teeth are getting yellow. My girlfriend doesn't like the smell. But on the other hand, like everyone in my band is like always smoking cigarettes. 

00:04:05
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. 

00:04:05
CONNOR And it's really hard not to, you know? Especially, you know, I don't want to say I'm addicted, but especially like when they're right in front of me and like, you know, it's just uh, I like, you know, I like the feeling so.... 

00:04:15
Reflection 

00:04:20
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. You feel the temptation when they're in front of you? 

00:04:20
CONNOR Yeah, definitely. 

00:04:20
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, and it sounds like there's a lot of reasons why you want to quit, but it's hard. It's been hard for you lately. 

00:04:25
CONNOR Yeah, it's really hard. 

00:04:25
Open-ended question 

00:04:30
DR. IAN SCHERE Uhm, what are some of the things your girlfriend's been telling you about smoking that she hasn't really liked? Sounds like you've really cared about that. 

00:04:35
CONNOR Yeah, well, obviously, like she just says it smells bad. 

00:04:40
DR. IAN SCHERE Okay. 

00:04:40
CONNOR You know? And then, like every time I'm smoking she's all like, you know, just like, quit. You're going to die, and stuff like that. And I'm like, well, yeah, I know, but.... 

00:04:45
Reflection 

00:04:45
DR. IAN SCHERE So it sounds like she's worried about you. 

00:04:50
CONNOR Yeah. Yeah. She's kind of worried. 

00:04:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. And it sounds like you might be a little bit worried about yourself. I heard you mention health concerns. 

00:04:55
CONNOR Yeah, like yesterday I was like, surfing blacks, like walking up the, the, you know, big trail up on the hill and like, I don't know. Like, usually uhm, I'm not that exhausted, but like, I was like, losing my breath like halfway up, you know? Like, coughing. You know, I'm pretty sure it's from cigarettes, you know? 

00:05:15
Reflection 

00:05:15
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. So you're, you're feeling some negative or adverse reactions already. 

00:05:20
CONNOR Yeah. 

00:05:20
DR. IAN SCHERE And it doesn't sound like you're very happy about that. 

00:05:20
CONNOR Yeah. It's kind of, you know, I don't like being at the bottom of the food chain, you know? I want to be like, healthy and stuff so. 

00:05:25
Affirmation 

00:05:30
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. You, you see yourself as a strong person and a, and a competent person, and you, you want to, you want to be successful. It sounds like that's important to you. 

00:05:35
CONNOR Exactly. 

00:05:35
DR. IAN SCHERE And uh, you see this as kind of diminishing that a little bit or taking away? 

00:05:40
CONNOR Yeah, you know, I thought I, I thought I could just like be strong, through it, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know. It sounds dumb, but I figured, you know, when I started like you know, I'm like a healthy person, like it wouldn't really effect me, but, you know, obviously if I'm losing my breath it's kind of a problem. 

00:05:55
Reflection 

00:05:55
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. You, you clearly have, clearly have an awareness of how it's impacting you in ways that you're not really happy about. 

00:06:00
Eliciting change talk with an open-ended questions 

00:06:05
DR. IAN SCHERE How do you think things would be different if you, if you did quit? I'm not, I'm not saying that you know, I'm not telling you to, but I'm just curious. If you were not smoking, how might things be different for you? 

00:06:15
CONNOR Well, I don't know. Like there'd be uhm, some good things, you know? Like, you know, my girlfriend would, like, you know, wouldn't get mad all the time at me. 

00:06:25
Change talk through reflection 

00:06:25
DR. IAN SCHERE So it might improve your relationship with your girlfriend? 

00:06:25
CONNOR Yeah. But, you know, on the other hand, like, when I'm with my like, band, band mates, you know, they might be like, oh, like you're like lame or something. And like, you know, they'll be like, in the circle smoking a cigarette and I'll be like, you know, you know, just somewhere else kind of like not attached with them, so.... 

00:06:45
DR. IAN SCHERE So, I'm hearing you talk about personal reasons to smoke because it relaxes you and it, it's tempting to you. And there's also some kind of social reasons why you want to smoke because you want to be included with your friends, and that makes a lot of sense. 

00:06:55
CONNOR Yeah, definitely. 

00:07:00
DR. IAN SCHERE It's hard to think to do things that make you feel like you're, you're not sharing times with your friends and the people you care about. 

00:07:05
CONNOR Yeah, I don't want-, definitely. And like, yeah, I don't want to be like an outcast from the group too. So.... 

00:07:10
Double-sided reflection 

00:07:15
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like a tough situation. You want to be accepted by your friends and be close with your band mates and at the same time, you also want to have a healthy lifestyle and, and feel strong and powerful, or continue to, because that's how you, you usually feel. And you don't really like doing something that uh, makes you feel weaker, or less healthy. 

00:07:35
CONNOR Definitely. 

00:07:35
Summary 

00:07:35
DR. IAN SCHERE Well, Connor, in, in summarizing what I've, what I've heard you share with me, and I appreciate you sharing what's been going on. It certainly sounds to me that you care a lot about trying to quit smoking and you're talking about how it's, it's hard for you and some of the reasons why it's challenging is because a lot of your friends and band mates smoke and you want to be included. You're almost worried about being, you know, alienated from them if you don't smoke. Uhm, but there's also a lot of reasons why you want to quit smoking. 

00:08:00
CONNOR Right. 

00:08:00
DR. IAN SCHERE I hear you saying that you don't like the, the negative hassle you get from your girlfriend, and you don't like her worrying about your health. You don't like the fact that your teeth are kind of getting yellow. And most importantly, I hear you saying that on a personal level you're realizing that there are things that you can't do. You don't feel as strong. You're not, you're not sounding as athletic as you were before you were smoking, and that's really bothering you. 

00:08:20
CONNOR Yeah, definitely. 

00:08:20
Affirmation (therapist-centered/compliment) 

00:08:25
DR. IAN SCHERE Uhm, I think it's great that you're focusing on your health and trying to be healthy. It's, it's pretty impressive that someone, you know, your age is already that aware of the things that you can do to have a, have a healthy lifestyle and you recognize that there's a lot of connection between being healthy and being happy. Uhm, I'm glad that you're talking to me about this, and uh, and I'm hoping we continue talking about it. 

00:08:50
CONNOR Definitely. 

00:08:50
Eliciting change talk (Taking steps) 

00:08:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Uhm, between now and the next time we meet, uhm, what do you think you're, you're willing to do to kind of take steps in this direction of limiting or quitting your, your use of smoking? 

00:09:00
CONNOR Honestly, uhm, I think that I just have to, you know, keep busy with other things, because like, you know, if I'm busy I won't be like thinking about smoking. That's like the hardest part, just finding stuff to do. 

00:09:15
DR. IAN SCHERE So, so, you're not sure which replacement activities would work, but there's something about just having alternatives to smoking that you think will really help you reach this goal or get there sooner? 

00:09:25
CONNOR Yeah. 

00:09:25
DR. IAN SCHERE Well great. I'm looking forward to uh, hearing where you're at next time we meet. 

00:09:30
CONNOR Okay, cool. Thanks. 

00:09:30
4 Guiding Principles Expressing Empathy Developing Discrepancy Rolling with resistance Supporting self-efficacy 

00:09:35
DR. JAMES ROGERS The four principles of motivational interviewing are expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy. Let's start with the first principle, expressing empathy. 

00:09:45
OARS Open-ended questions Affirmations Reflections Summarize 

00:09:50
DR. JAMES ROGERS Here we have a nice easy way to remember how to do this by the acronym of OARS. O stands for open-ended questions. A is for affirmations. R is for reflections and S is for summaries. Using the OARS helps convey to the client that you're understanding and listening from their perspective, while equally allowing them to engage in the conversation. Here's some examples of the OARS used in practice. 

00:10:15
Dr. Rogers and Rochelle 

00:10:15
Opening statement with Open-ended question 

00:10:20
DR. JAMES ROGERS Okay, Rochelle, so, uhm, I do understand a little bit of the reasons why you're here today, but I'm certainly curious and would like to hear from your perspective of kind of what's going on lately. 

00:10:35
ROCHELLE Uhm, well you have my case file, so you pretty much know why I'm here. Uhm, I got in trouble for having fun, for drinking with my friends. It doesn't, I don't know, is that a crime? I really don't know why I'm here. 

00:10:55
Double-sided reflection 

00:10:55
DR. JAMES ROGERS It just sounds like you're, on the one hand, you were having a good time with your friends, and that was your goal. You were going out to have a good time and somehow along the way you ended up getting in trouble. 

00:11:05
ROCHELLE Yeah. Exactly. And, I pretty much, it's pretty much in the nutshell. I want to go out for a friend's birthday party. We're all having having a nice time, you know, I had a couple of drinks, and before I knew it on my way home, cop pulls me over and said I had too much. 

00:11:25
Open-ended question 

00:11:30
DR. JAMES ROGERS What was that experience like for you when that happened? 

00:11:35
ROCHELLE It sucked. I mean, it, it's no fun, you know, even just to get a regular ticket, but a DUI? Come on, that's pretty serious. Uhm, and I don't think I deserved that. 

00:11:50
Affirmation and open-ended question 

00:11:50
DR. JAMES ROGERS So Rochelle, I want to commend you in that when you mentioned the DUI is a pretty serious thing, what kind of impact has this been having on you? 

00:12:00
ROCHELLE Well, it's an inconvenience to my life. First of all, I'm here with you. I don't, I don't know why I'm here. I don't want to be at these sessions. So, there's a big chunk of time taken out, I think, of like my personal freedom, to be here, and uhm, yeah, and it's expensive. I have to, you know, pay for some other classes because of this situation. 

00:12:30
Affirmation + summary + double-sided reflection 

00:12:30
DR. JAMES ROGERS So I really want to appreciate your honesty and what you've been saying. I do realize it's an inconvenience, uh, and disturbing on multiple levels from what I'm hearing in terms of an inconvenience on your time, uh, not to mention your freedom, as well as the expenses related to this. And, and even being honest about that you're not happy about being here with me. I can certainly understand that and, and certainly can understand how and why you would feel that way. And I certainly want to let you know that it's okay with me to have those feelings. Uh, it's certainly understandable given the circumstances, that on the one hand you felt like you were going out just to have a good time with your friends, and at the same time you ended up getting into this situation that's led you to have some difficulties. 

00:13:10
Affirmation 

00:13:15
DR. JAMES ROGERS So I do want to commend you for at least sticking it through and following through with what they've been asking you to do. It takes a lot for a person to be able to do something despite having a lot of feelings and reasons why they may not want to do it. 

00:13:25
ROCHELLE I don't want to get into more trouble, so, here I am. 

00:13:30
Complex reflection 

00:13:30
DR. JAMES ROGERS It sounds like despite what's been happening, there's a strong desire for you to not want to be in further trouble, given the circumstances. 

00:13:35
ROCHELLE That would be correct. Yup. 

00:13:45
DR. JAMES ROGERS The second principle, developing discrepancy is used to help to bring both sides of the ambivalence, or two incompatible thoughts or feelings together into the conversation. They're often used with the phrases, on the one hand or on the other hand. Other ways to bring two incompatible thoughts together include using the terms and, and at the same time, while avoiding using the terms but or however. Here's some examples of how we develop discrepancy. 

00:14:15
Dr. Schere and Joe 

00:14:20
JOE It's a feeling, you know, just feeling scared, like uh, well, if I do it and what happens, you know, if it doesn't work out, then what? Or uhm, just kind of, also just thinking of, I think for me it's like losing the relationships that I have? I think that's uh, as I'm just coming up from here and just how, uh, how connected I am with folks out here and then having to move and, and leave that and start another transition. 

00:14:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. 

00:14:50
JOE I'm not sure if uh, I want to do it. And then I just like, kind of pulled back too from experiencing that. 

00:15:00
Double-sided reflection 

00:15:00
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, there's no way for it to be a perfect match. I mean it sounds like there's going to be things about moving to LA that you're excited about and that you like, uhm, but there's going, but by doing that you're certainly going to be giving up certain things that you care about. And it sounds like on the other hand, if you stay in San Diego, you'll be able to keep a lot of things which are in your life that you like but there's something that you've been, you mentioned that you've always thought you'd move to LA for uhm, that you've, it's obviously pretty important to you because you're still thinking about it, you know, as time has gone on. 

00:15:30
Seeking elaboration 

00:15:30
DR. IAN SCHERE Uhm, help me understand. Tell me, tell me about what it is about moving to LA that made you think that there's something you always planned to do? 

00:15:35
JOE I've always kind of told myself, like this is like going out there and visiting a lot, like this is a place where I can see myself? Uhm, and the, the field of work that I do too, I always said like this is an area where I can see myself do work with community. Uhm, so it's always been there and my plan, the plan that I'd set is once I finished school and I have no other obligations or ties, like that's my opportunity to do it. And so, here I am, uh, being done with school and it's like, all right, are you going to follow through with your word now that, you know, you've kind of said this. Like, you have no, uh, no things holding you back so here it is. Like, are you going to do it or are you just going to not do it? 

00:16:20
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, so it's kind of like now that that time has arrived and you're, you're looking into that, that door that's finally opened for you, you know, because it sounds as though you're almost kind of, you know, searching inside as far as you know, is this something I really want to do? And is something, and what are the things about doing it which, which I still like. And what are the things I'm giving up? 

00:16:40
JOE Right. 

00:16:40
DR. IAN SCHERE Sometimes, there's a difference between what sounds good in our head and what, how we experience things. 

00:16:50
JOE Yeah, well, that makes, makes sense. I just uh, I just don't want it to be hard. 

00:16:55
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. Yeah, and I understand. I understand. 

00:17:00
JOE It's uh, just, wanting it to be easy, uhm, but also just like, I also want to be able to just to make a choice. Like just, just do it and not have to worry about, you know, being scared about it or, just kind of just roll with it and do it. 

00:17:15
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:17:15
JOE Uh, trying to, try to, I'm trying to allow myself to do it, but it's just there's, it seems like I just, I can't. 

00:17:20
Reflection 

00:17:20
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, there's a part of you that really wishes this was an easier thing to do or an easier decision to make, you know. And it sounds there's, it sounds like you're kind of frustrated about the fact that you're struggling so much with the decision to do it or not. 

00:17:35
Summary 

00:17:35
DR. IAN SCHERE So right, I understand better now why you're considering this move to LA, and it sounds like something you've been planning on doing for a while and when you've been up there, there's a lot of good opportunities up there for you. There's, it feels like a place that, that could be your home, or feels like it should be your home. Just, you have a lot of opportunities for the thing and the type of work that you want to do and I totally understand why it's hard for you to just give up on the notion of doing it. It's been a plan you've been kind of focusing on for a long time. Uhm, I also hear that there are things in San Diego that you've grown really familiar with and they're important to you. 

00:18:10
Open-ended question 

00:18:10
DR. IAN SCHERE Uhm, tell me about some of those things. What are the things in San Diego that are making the decision to move to LA harder than you expected it to be? 

00:18:20
JOE Uhm, I think just the people that I met here out in San Diego who I now kind of like consider my family. Uhm, just a real uhm, just the beauty of our relationships that we've had? 

00:18:35
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. 

00:18:35
JOE Uhm, just all the, the good memories, uhm, the hard work that I've invested uhm, living here, you know and having this be a big chunk of my life and almost in the sense of, of holding that as like, something really true to myself? Like, just like, this is uhm, I've managed over the years just to get through it, you know, and with that it's just knowing the, the people that I came into connections with, like my friends. Uh, I've had, you know, I've even had family that moved out here so, you know, there's that part too. And having like a a niece now that's closer to me and, and I also when I think of like if I have to bounce, then, I, you know, I lose that connection that I'm just establishing again with my niece. And, uhm, so I think overall, it's just the, my friendships, and then just my work too. I've, I've been working here for quite a while now and I work with, I work with adolescents and uhm, I do good work and uhm, it's, it's kind of like hard to, like say goodbye to that? Or, you know, stuff. So it's just I established a, I felt like I established a place for myself here. 

00:19:50
Double-sided reflection Empathize with ambivilance 

00:19:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, so the idea of LA being a home, it sounds good to you and is something you thought would be great. And at the same time, San Diego, it feels like your home. 

00:20:00
JOE Yeah. Oh no, it was just, yeah, and I'm feeling like it's just uh, like it's time for me to just kind of transition, like I...okay. 

00:20:10
DR. IAN SCHERE Okay. Yeah. Another principle of motivational interviewing is rolling with resistance. Often times when people are struggling to make a change, they are resistant to some of their own suggestions, their own ideas as to what they might want to do to solve it. And also maybe resistant to the conversation altogether because it may be bringing up negative or confusing feelings. In understanding the spirit of MI being a collaborative approach, resistance from the people we're having conversations with is our signal from them that we're not really understanding them. And when we hear resistance coming from our, from the people we're talking to, it's important that we recognize that we need to do a better job to understand their situation. Here's some examples of a client saying things which may be resistant in nature and us attempting to understand the situation better from their point of view so that they continue to work with us rather than get discouraged and, and end the conversation. 

00:21:10

00:21:10
Dr. Schere and Connor 

00:21:10
Double-sided reflection 

00:21:15
DR. IAN SCHERE Well, Connor I really hear how important it is for you to, to try to quit smoking and I also am hearing you say that it's hard. And there's a lot of things in your life that make it, that make it hard and have thrown you back when you've taken those steps to, to to try to quit. 

00:21:30
Open-ended question Eliciting ability 

00:21:30
DR. IAN SCHERE Uhm, Well, tell me some of the things that you've tried. 

00:21:30
CONNOR Well, like I tried quitting for like three days, you know? 

00:21:35
DR. IAN SCHERE Okay. Good for you. 

00:21:35
CONNOR Well, that was like how successful I was. Thanks. But uhm, you know, you know it was good for like three days, you know? I felt kind of accomplished, you know? 

00:21:45
Reflection 

00:21:45
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, so there was a, a sense of accomplishment even after just three days of being able to abstain. 

00:21:50
CONNOR Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. What else felt good about those three days when you weren't smoking? 

00:21:55
CONNOR I actually uhm, I didn't smell like cigarettes, so you know, my girlfriend liked that and- 

00:22:00
DR. IAN SCHERE So you liked how you smelled. Your girlfriend liked how you smelled? 

00:22:00
CONNOR Yeah. Yeah. 

00:22:00
DR. IAN SCHERE Which, you know, which matters when you, when you're in a relationship. 

00:22:05
CONNOR Definitely. Yeah, but, I mean obviously it didn't work out too well, you know? I was like, buying gas at a gas station and couldn't help but buying a pack of cigarettes, you know? And then after that it was just kind of like, over, you know? I just kept buying more so.... 

00:22:20
/Empathizing with ambivilance 

00:22:25
DR. IAN SCHERE So, it's hard sometimes when you, when you do fall off track from your goal to kind of get back on track. That once you, you bought that pack of cigarettes you kind of gave up on your goals for a little while. 

00:22:35
CONNOR Yeah. I was like, what's the point, you know? 

00:22:35
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, and that happens sometimes. Sometimes people kind of fall back, you know, back off of their goals. But, well I'm also hearing you say that it hasn't really gone away. You're still here talking about quitting smoking and really wanting to. 

00:22:50
CONNOR Yeah. 

00:22:50
Affirmation 

00:22:50
DR. IAN SCHERE And it sounds like you really felt good after those three days and, you know, it is impressive to be able to do it even for a day. So three days is a, is pretty impressive. 

00:23:00
CONNOR Good. 

00:23:00
Open-ended question Looking forward 

00:23:00
DR. IAN SCHERE How do you think you'd feel if you were able to not smoke for six days, or maybe two weeks straight? 

00:23:05
CONNOR Uhm, I'd feel like really fresh, you know? Feel healthy, you know and probably wouldn't be so mad all the time, you know? 

00:23:15
DR. IAN SCHERE So you think it would, it would, it would improve your mood as well as how you feel about yourself and feeling more athletic. 

00:23:20
CONNOR Yeah, definitely. 

00:23:20
Summary Change talk-desire 

00:23:20
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. Well, Connor, to summarize what I'm hearing, because I want to make sure that I'm understanding what you're saying. It sounds as though when you talk about quitting, the three days you were able to successfully quit, you had some really strong feelings of accomplishment. Uhm, and when you think about going longer periods of time or quitting smoking altogether, you think, you think it'd it'd be, there's a lot of thing about it that you'd like. You like, you like the idea of feeling healthier, of feeling more athletic, smelling better, and you think it would improve your mood and also the interactions that you have with your girlfriend. And those sound like some really important things to you. 

00:24:00
CONNOR Yeah. I think it'd be worth it, you know? 

00:24:00
Summary Change talk-ability 

00:24:00
DR. IAN SCHERE And I also hear that you have uh, you've taken some pretty impressive steps to try. And even though it wasn't as successful as you would like, you certainly, you know, showed the ability to, to abstain from smoking for a couple of days and as you think about quitting for longer periods of time, all those good things just get bigger and bigger. Is that right? 

00:24:20
CONNOR Yeah, definitely. 

00:24:20
Eliciting change talk Taking steps 

00:24:25
DR. IAN SCHERE Well I'd love to ask what kinds of things you might be willing to do or consider doing after our conversation right now, uhm, that are in that same direction? 

00:24:30
CONNOR Uhm, I'd be willing to, you know, like maybe, like have designated days to like not smoke, you know? Or, either that or, you know, set up some reward system or something where like, you know, I buy myself a big hamburger or something. 

00:24:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Okay. 

00:24:50
CONNOR I don't really know. It's kind of hard, you know? It's hard to just stop. 

00:24:55
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, you're not exactly sure what, what will work, but there's certainly some ideas you have and something about giving yourself days when you're going to really focus on it more than other days seems a bit more manageable to you. Or some kind of real big reward to say if I succeed with this I'm going to do something to treat myself because you would be proud of yourself and appropriately so. I mean, this is a hard thing for a lot of people to do, and I think it's really great that you're, you're looking to tackle it so, you know, at such an early age. 

00:25:20
CONNOR Definitely. 

00:25:25
DR. IAN SCHERE And without having to have already paid the price that many people pay when they put this kind of challenge off for a long period of time. The final principle of motivational interviewing is supporting self-efficacy. For people to make the changes they want they need to be reminded and recognized and experience the fact that they're the ones who need to do the work. They're the ones who need to do the changing. So one of the aspects of motivational interviewing is through our conversation with them, supporting them, collaborating with them, but also reminding them that they are capable. They have the desire, the ability and the means to make the changes they want. And maintain the ownership of having to make those changes happen. Here are some examples of supporting self-efficacy. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:10
Dr. Schere and Joe 

00:26:15
JOE It was just, yeah, and I'm feeling like it's just uh, like it's time for me to just kind of, transition. Like I ... 

00:26:20
DR. IAN SCHERE Okay. 

00:26:20
JOE Okay. 

00:26:20
Reflection Change talk 

00:26:25
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, so you feel like the time is ready, the time is right for you to make that transition to, to follow ahead with what your plan's always been. And I hear you saying you wish it was as easier to just close the door on the decision to just focus single-mindedly on doing it and just do it. And it's been harder than you'd like it to be. 

00:26:40
JOE Yeah. 

00:26:40
Affirmation 

00:26:40
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, and I, and I hear that and I wish it was easier. And sometimes some of these important decisions can be really hard. And I appreciate you kind of sharing all the things that are going on with it so we can understand best what's making it a hard decision and help to clarify what seems to be the best choice for you. 

00:27:00
Supporting self-efficacy 

00:27:00
DR. IAN SCHERE And again, it's, it's going to be your choice and you do have the choice to do whatever you think feels right at the time and modify it as time goes on. 

00:27:10
Looking forward 

00:27:10
DR. IAN SCHERE Thinking about where things are, I'm just curious if you, if you, uh, imagine yourself ten years from now having never, having never left San Diego and moving to LA. How do you imagine you'd feel when you're thinking about the decision to stay here. 

00:27:25
JOE As you say it I question the first thing that comes up for me is like, for some reason I don't know why I'm thinking regret? Or not so much, or yeah, regret or like, what if, like, what if I would have went? You know? What if uh, I would have just been able to just say hey, I'm going to go with it and make this decision and move out to LA. Uhm, but I also think now, like I also am thinking, like oh well, I'll still have my friends, you know? Uhm, I'll still be in a comfortable enviromment, a familiar environment that I know that's easy to get around and to move. Uhm, so lot of familiar uhm, places, and people, and work. But, and it's coming up again, just like ah, like well what if? Like what if I was able to do that? 

00:28:15
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, that sounds like that's a pretty, a pretty strong what if. 

00:28:15
JOE Yeah. 

00:28:15
DR. IAN SCHERE Inside of you. Thinking about if you never make that move. So, if I'm understanding you, you think that that, that idea of moving to LA isn't going to go away if you decide not to do it now, that there's a part of you that's going to be holding on to that, you know, what if, or what would have been if I never, if I would have tried. 

00:28:35
JOE Yeah, and I want to say it, it's there too, and it's kind of like not going away because I had an opportunity once and then I, I didn't take it and I just felt like, all-. And one of the reasons why I didn't take it was because the school factor. Well, I've got to finish my school and then once I finish, then okay, I'll go. And so, like I'm saying like, so here it is, this opportunity has come up again and it's now like, all right, well, am I going to follow through with it. Am I going to be true to my word that I'm saying like, yeah, you know, once I'm done with school then I'm going to head out and stuff, so.... 

00:29:05
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. So you really believe deep down that it's not going to go away because you an opportunity in the past to move to LA. You didn't do it and that, that idea stayed with you and is still with you. 

00:29:15
JOE Yeah. 

00:29:15
Summary 

00:29:15
DR. IAN SCHERE Well, if I could just summarize what we're talking about, because I want to make sure I'm, I'm with you. You know, it sounds like you have an important and really difficult decision to make. There's a part of you that really wants to go to LA, and has been planning to it, and feels like you'll have regret if you never try. And on the other hand, you're comfortable in San Diego. You have a lot of people you really care about. You have a job. You have a lot of familiar things which, which you, you do care about. And it sounds like at some level you're going to be okay either way, because there are things which are really positive to hold on to whichever decision you make. So Ray, am I understanding kind of what's making this decision so hard for you? Does that seem to capture it? 

00:30:00
JOE Uhm, yeah. I think if I could add one more piece in that? 

00:30:00
DR. IAN SCHERE Oh, please do, yeah. 

00:30:00
JOE I think uhm, is my relationship with my partner, who's out in LA. 

00:30:10
DR. IAN SCHERE Oh, okay. 

00:30:10
JOE And so, there's a part of me that's feeling uhm, if I don't move, then what is that saying about my relationship, uhm, with my partner? Rather, you know, if I were to stay- 

00:30:25
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, so there's a whole nother dimension to this decision. Uhm, it sounds like there's, there's important relationships which wherever you go and in some level you're kind of stuck because you're going to be choosing against one relationship versus others, and that certainly makes this.... Well, it certainly makes sense why this has been so hard for you. 

00:30:40
JOE Yeah, and then just uhm, when you just asked, with coming with that question, it got me to think well, what's missing? And then it, it like came up for me as well that, that that factor is just my relationship that I have with my partner and it's coming like, yeah, I have all these different relationships and it's like, how do I manage to, to work both relationships in two different places? 

00:31:05
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, and it sounds like part of making this decision is being able to decide that you're going to put more energy and attention towards one relationship or some relationships versus other relationships. And that doesn't ever feel good, but it seems like that's the decision which is going to be made one way or the other. 

00:31:20
JOE Yeah. Because I have to make one, so. 

00:31:25
DR. IAN SCHERE Well, having talked about this, and again, I, I, you know I appreciate you sharing so much and I, and I commend how much time and energy you're putting into it because it really shows that you, that you value a lot of things about who you are and your accomplishments and especially your social relationships. Uhm, having talked about the different options you have, what do you, what do feel most inclined to do? 

00:31:50
JOE Uhm, I definitely want to slow it down. 

00:31:55
DR. IAN SCHERE Okay. 

00:31:55
JOE Uhm, give my uh, not having to rush and make a decision. So just allowing myself a little more time to just get more clarity on uhm, what would be the best, the best outcome for me that's going to make me happy, that's going to, uhm, that I'm going to find myself, you know, just being who I am as a person. And, uh, so I think I just want to definitely allow myself to slow it down and not be so hard on myself. 

00:32:25
DR. IAN SCHERE It's important for you to make the right decision for you. 

00:32:25
JOE Yeah. 

00:32:25
DR. IAN SCHERE And in order to do that, you need to be able to take a little bit of the pressure off of this time crunch and really, and really kind of explore the pros and cons, you know, a little bit slower. And to make a decision that you really know is coming from your heart and not because of external pressures. Is that, is that right? 

00:32:45
JOE Yeah. I like what you said, uhm, make this a decision about me. 

00:32:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. 

00:32:50
JOE And I think that's a, good with that. 

00:32:50
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah, and ultimately it is going to be your decision. Uhm, what is something, what are some things you might be able to do after this conversation to give you that time and space you need to take some of that pressure off of you? 

00:33:05
JOE Uhm, I definitely, sharing it more with my friends, definitely letting them know how I feel. And, I'll just be more uhm, be more honest about uhm, where I'm at with them, because I know I brought it up. It's been really brief and so just, you know, talking more about it I think would definitely help, help out. 

00:33:20
DR. IAN SCHERE Well it makes sense that a part of what's making this decision so hard is that you really value these social relationships and so perhaps part of the solution is really bringing these relationships into the process itself. 

00:33:30
JOE Yeah. 

00:33:30
Elicit Change Talk Explore pros and cons Seek elaboration Imagine extreme outcomes Look forward Look backward Readiness ruler 

00:33:35
DR. IAN SCHERE Yeah. Now that we've discussed the overall spirit of motivational interviewing and the principles which guide it, let's talk a little bit about this term change talk. One of the things that we know and appreciate from motivational interviewing is that clients are more likely to make the changes they want if they're able to create the arguments themselves for why these changes are important to them. So often what we're trying to do is listen for those kind of statements that clients make which are speaking and arguing for why these changes are important, why they care about them, how things in their lives may be better from them. And then to encourage to elaborate and really harness these arguments because the relationship between those arguments and behavior changes uhm, is clearly connected. Here are some examples of attempts to elicit change talk during an MI conversation. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:30
Dr. Rogers and Rochelle 

00:34:35
ROCHELLE Well, it was a big surprise. I mean I've gotten, you know, one other issue before where, you know, it involved drinking but, uhm, it wasn't as severe as this. 

00:34:50
Double-sided reflection 

00:34:50
DR. JAMES ROGERS So it sounds like there may have been some experiences with alcohol in the past that have led to some difficulties, not to the same degree. And at the same time, here you are having this experience at this point in time. 

00:35:00
ROCHELLE Yes. 

00:35:00
Open-ended question (developing discrepancy) 

00:35:05
DR. JAMES ROGERS How do you make sense of those two events? 

00:35:05
ROCHELLE Uhm, I don't know if I, you know, can really make sense of it, because I mean, I don't really drink that much. I go out with myfriends, and that's when I, you know, I want to have fun and fit in with my friends. But still, I don't think I drink that much. And, uhm, the other time, the first time I had some issues is like maybe, I don't know if I had a little bit too much, but I got sick, uhm, really sick. But, uhm, this time, I was fine. I felt I was fine to drive and uhm, so this time is different because, you know, of the consequences, I guess you can say. 

00:35:55
Reflection and open-ended question 

00:36:00
DR. JAMES ROGERS And you mentioned that last time something like this happened, you found yourself getting really sick. Can you say more about what that looked like when you got sick last time? 

00:36:10
ROCHELLE Uhm, well, I threw up. I was dancing on the middle of the dance floor with my friends and suddenly I just felt like really dizzy and woozy, and I had to just, I thought I just needed some fresh air. I thought it was just, you know, that it was a really crowded club. Uhm, but as I was walking towards the door, I just went bleah, you know And, once that happened, I felt better. Uhm, and, and then I just needed the air and then I was, you know, I was okay. Uhm, but, you know, this time, you know, I didn't get sick or anything like that. I just, I felt pretty good. And so, that's why, I don't know. Everything's like a big surprise. It's just all this trouble. 

00:37:00
Reflection (empathy) 

00:37:05
DR. JAMES ROGERS So it seems like in both scenarios, you started out really wanting to have a good time with your friends. 

00:37:10
ROCHELLE Yeah. 

00:37:10
DR. JAMES ROGERS That was your goal, to go out that night, and just really have a fun time with them. 

00:37:10
ROCHELLE Right. Don't you like to like, go out and have fun with your friends and just kind of cut loose after a day's work or something? 

00:37:20
Affirmation and complex reflection 

00:37:20
DR. JAMES ROGERS Sure, it totally makes sense, that after a long, hard day's work that you want to blow off steam and just really enjoy yourself. And it sounds like you have a nice desire to want to balance your life out that way in terms of having fun as well as working hard at what you do. 

00:37:30
ROCHELLE Yeah. 

00:37:30
Double-sided reflection 

00:37:30
DR. JAMES ROGERS Yeah. And at the same time, sometimes some of this fun has led you to have at least two experiences where uh, they were quite negative in terms of the, how they ended even though that wasn't your intention. 

00:37:45
ROCHELLE Yeah, I guess so. 

00:37:45
Open-ended question 

00:37:45
DR. JAMES ROGERS What would you like to see different about the situation? 

00:37:50
ROCHELLE Uhm, I just want to put this all behind me. I want to put this in the past. I want to be able to move on with a fresh start and as if like none of this ever happened. 

00:38:00
DR. JAMES ROGERS Okay. 

00:38:00
ROCHELLE Uhm, I just basically want to like get through everything as quickly as I can and get it behind me. It's just like a, been a nightmare. And I'm ready for the nightmare to end. 

00:38:10
Complex reflection 

00:38:10
DR. JAMES ROGERS Sure, it's a pretty traumatic experience and it sounds like you want to move past it. 

00:38:15
ROCHELLE Yes. 

00:38:15
Complex reflection and double-sided reflection 

00:38:15
DR. JAMES ROGERS So Rochelle, I, I totally hear you and I think I totally get it. This has been a very traumatic experience for you and you, your wish is to really just put this behind you, as would be most people's wish to put that behind. And at the same time, I really want to commend you. You, you're really focused and you seem pretty determined to do what it takes to comply with what everyone's asking you to do, with the purpose of putting this behind you, and not getting into further trouble. So, that, that's great. I'm really, I'm really glad you're doing that. 

00:38:45
Double-sided reflection with open-ended question 

00:38:45
DR. JAMES ROGERS Uhm, at the same time, I'm wondering what this might look like once this is behind you, how you'd like to see yourself go from here and your future. 

00:38:55
Developing Discrepancy 

00:39:00
DR. JAMES ROGERS And any possibility of, of ever being in a similar situation like this again? 

00:39:05
ROCHELLE Well, once this is all behind me, I'll be very happy. Uhm, I'll just probably I don't know, be more mindful of like, how many drinks I'm having, and uhm, if I'm really okay to drive, I guess. Uhm, because I don't want to be in this situation again. 

00:39:25
Reflection and affirmation 

00:39:25
DR. JAMES ROGERS Yeah, so it's clear that even once this is behind you, you really don't ever want to be in this scenario again? 

00:39:30
ROCHELLE No. 

00:39:30
Eliciting change talk 

00:39:30
DR. JAMES ROGERS Yeah, and that's a great goal. That's a great goal for, for you to have and for anyone to have. And at the same time, you mentioned you will be more mindful when you go out and, and go out partying and having fun with your friends. What might that look like to you? What does being more mindful mean to you? 

00:39:45
ROCHELLE Well, like I said, I would just like be more careful with how many drinks I'm having maybe, you know? Instead of having three, four, or whatever, I'd just have one, just a social drink, and not overdo it. 

00:40:05
DR. JAMES ROGERS Okay. 

00:40:05
ROCHELLE Uhm, don't try to keep up with my friends. 

00:40:05
DR. JAMES ROGERS Okay. 

00:40:05
ROCHELLE So, yeah, I would just, I would just slow it down. 

00:40:10
Complex reflection 

00:40:10
DR. JAMES ROGERS Okay, so it sounds like being more aware of how much you're actually drinking and putting a number on it. You mentioned one, that having one drink and not necessarily trying keep up with your friends would be something that would be a good place to start for you. 

00:40:25
ROCHELLE Yeah, I think so. 

00:40:25
Eliciting change talk-abilities 

00:40:25
DR. JAMES ROGERS Okay. And how do you feel about your abilities in going out and doing that? 

00:40:30
ROCHELLE Uhm, well, I feel pretty confident in my abilities to do that because, like I said, I don't want this situation to ever happen again. So, this has just been a big learning lesson for me and, yeah, I'm sure I can do it. 

00:40:50
Complex reflection 

00:40:55
DR. JAMES ROGERS So, you mentioned the term learning lesson, and you mentioned the word traumatic earlier, that it just seems like this was almost a bit of a wake up call for you to have this experience and... 

00:41:05
ROCHELLE Yeah. I guess, yeah it has been even though I don't totally see, you know, that I did anything wrong still. But, uhm, I guess it's just like, it's not really, I don't know, a wake up call for me. It's just like, I'm just more aware that I probably need to make some changes in, you know how much I drink or whatever, I guess. That was the issue, why I'm here. 

00:41:35
Affirmation and double-sided reflection 

00:41:40
DR. JAMES ROGERS Okay, so thanks for correcting me. It sounds like maybe my, my choice of words didn't exactly capture your experience of it, and that while on the one hand you still want to be able to go out with your friends and have fun and cut loose, that at the same time, some of the behaviors that you chose to do afterwards that maybe have led to this bad outcome. And you're willing, certainly, to do something about those behaviors. 

00:42:00
ROCHELLE Yeah. I am. 

00:42:00
Summary, affirmation, summary 

00:42:00
DR. JAMES ROGERS So to recap, you're, you're willing to do what the courts are asking you to do. 

00:42:05
ROCHELLE Yes. 

00:42:05
DR. JAMES ROGERS Including these session, which, again, I appreciate your honesty. I know it's uncomfortable and you probably have other places you'd rather be. 

00:42:10
ROCHELLE That's the truth. 

00:42:15
DR. JAMES ROGERS Yeah. But I do commend for at least following through with that. I know it's hard sometimes for people to do things they don't want to do. And at the same time, you're, you know, you're going to pay the fines and you're pretty clear that your goal is to never be in this kind of situation again. 

00:42:25
ROCHELLE Yes. 100 percent, yes. 

00:42:30
DR. JAMES ROGERS Good. And it sounds like you're even willing to make some changes moving forward that in terms of next time you find yourself out with your friends that limiting to one drink and not keeping up with them is, is a place you'll start. 

00:42:45
ROCHELLE You're correct again. 

00:42:45
DR. JAMES ROGERS Yeah? We hope you've enjoyed this overview and introduction to motivational interviewing. 

00:42:55
DR. IAN SCHERE And we hope that some of the things you've seen and learned about in this video assist you in the important work that you're doing helping others make important changes in their lives.
