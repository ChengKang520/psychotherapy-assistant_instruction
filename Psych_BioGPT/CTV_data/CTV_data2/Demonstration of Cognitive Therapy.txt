The Evolution of Psychotherapy A Conference 

00:00:40
Demonstration of Cognitive Therapy Aaron Beck, M.D. Judith Beck, Ph.D., 

00:00:40
AARON BECK Welcome everybody. Uh, I can't see any of you because of the lights, although I hope maybe they'll turn it up a bit. Um, but, you can see me, so it won't be a proper introduction without my being able to relate directly to you but anyhow, my name is Aaron Beck. If you don't recognize the name, you're in the wrong panel. And, this is Dr. Judy Beck, who is the, uh, director of the Beck Institute in Philadelphia and is in charge of the clinical program and the training program. Um, this morning, uh, we want to demonstrate something about cognitive therapy, and I say that advisedly, because to really get a notion of what cognitive therapy is about, requires not simply the reading, but a lot of exposure to the actual demonstrations and treatment of the, uh, individual patients. Uh, our training program actually takes a whole year, uh, for the intramural training, and the extramural training, uh, which is not done on a daily basis but consists of patients sending video tapes in or audio tapes, as a therapist would send them in and then they would get supervised on them. Uh, so, the best I can do today with you is to give you kind of a biopsy of the approach, uh, and what you're going to get then is a very restricted sample, but I think it'll give you something of the flavor as to how I approach a patient. Obviously what you're going to do is you're going to get a kind of a telescoping of what would be standard over a longer period of time. So ordinarily I do spend some time developing a relationship with a patient, and then I get into other aspects, components, and issues. What isn't really possible is to show you everything about how I will develop this kind of relationship, what we call a collaborative empiricism. This afternoon, when we do our workshop and also tomorrow, I'll be able to show that I'm emphasizing the relationship part because, uh, many people will say cognitive therapy is strictly a mechanical process and does not involve the affective emotional relationship parts of human behavior, and it certainly is just as important in cognitive therapy as it is in any of the other approaches. So, uh, without, uh, much more ado, what we'd like to do next is, uh, we need to have volunteers, uh, who will role-play some patient that they have. There are a number of possible ways of going about this. One is people can just come up and volunteer, which I think is probably gonna be the, the quickest way of doing this. The kind of case that I would like to show would be a more fundamental case, such as depression or anxiety. Now, if any one of you has a case of depression that you would like to role play, so I'll have a chance to show what the basic cognitive approach is to depression, I'd be very happy to go ahead with that. We could also do the same thing with generalized anxiety disorder. So, while you're thinking about who, who in the group would like to volunteer, I'd like to mention a couple of things about what the approach will be. First is the, uh, remember we don't have eight or 10 sessions in which to really get out the basic problems, so when you do volunteer and role play the patient, try to make the case real to the way the patient is but don't make it so difficult that we won't be able to demonstrate the techniques. On the other hand, don't make it so easy that we lose credibility, so, so keep in mind what the parameters are of, uh, the particular exercise. Uh, now, I think, uh, what I would like to do is to ask for some volunteer to come up and, uh, hi. We have a volunteer already? Okay. Now while the volunteer is getting hooked up, I'll tell you what my approach is going to be. I'm going to try to establish a relationship, some kind of relationship relatively rapidly. I'm then going to try to get some concept as to what the specific cognitive problem is. And then I'm going to try one or two or more, uh, interventions. Then, after I've gone far enough to give you a taste as to what the approach will be, then Judy, uh, who is the supervisor today, will then make comments on what I did, and also make suggestions as to where I might go from here. Now, if I get stuck during the interview, I will turn to Judy, and if she's stuck, then we'll ask members of the audience to give us suggestions as to, uh, how to go about it. Now, is, uh, our volunteer still getting hooked up? Are you all ready? Okay. We're, this, the chair is here. Here Judy, do you want to hold these for me? 

00:06:25
JUDY Sure. 

00:06:25
AARON BECK Okay, well first of all I want to congratulate you for volunteering. If you hadn't come up, we would've been stuck. 

00:06:35
DANA Okay. 

00:06:35
AARON BECK And, uh, being a volunteer means you can't do anything wrong. 

00:06:45
DANA Good. 

00:06:45
AARON BECK The only person who can do wrong things is myself, and then Judy's over here to correct me, so, you just be yourself, but, uh, then try to describe something about the patient, then you become the patient. 

00:06:55
"MIKE Okay, and the patient that I'm, um, role playing, the client is a male. 

00:07:00
AARON BECK Right. 

00:07:00
DANA Um, so, um. 

00:07:00
AARON BECK And what name, uh, shall we give him? 

00:07:05
DANA Uh, we'll call him Mike. 

00:07:10
AARON BECK Okay. 

00:07:10
DANA Okay. Um, do you want any history or, what? (crosstalk) I missed that part. 

00:07:15
AARON BECK Yeah, well just give a little thing first of all why Mike came to treatment. And we don't want a, a long history. 

00:07:20
DANA (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:07:20
AARON BECK Because I want to show you how we can get at the history in the course of the interview. 

00:07:30
DANA (crosstalk) Okay. Okay. Um, well, um, I, he came, he came... 

00:07:35
AARON BECK So Mike. 

00:07:35
DANA Okay, let me, okay, he came into treatment, um, recently divorced, father of two children. He's raising the children, um, and his wife left him, uh, and was having a lot of extra marital affairs with, uh, a lot of people and, um, is a recovering alcoholic, has been sober for, um, six years with one relapse. Six months prior to entering treatment, been in treatment now two years, um, and seems to have a reoccurring theme of not feeling, um, worthwhile or capable in certain areas. 

00:08:15
AARON BECK Uh-huh. And is he clinically depressed? 

00:08:15
DANA I think he's, he's clinically diagnosed, I, I would say more dysthymic. 

00:08:20
AARON BECK Uh-huh. 

00:08:20
DANA And possibly psychothymic. He goes a little bit up and a little bit down, but not extremely manic or extremely depressed. 

00:08:25
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Okay ,you're Mike. 

00:08:25
DANA (crosstalk) Mike. Okay. 

00:08:25
AARON BECK And I'm gonna try to get you into the role rapidly and I'll , I'llask you questions. 

00:08:35
DANA (crosstalk) Okay. Okay. 

00:08:35
AARON BECK And we can tell by your reactions whether you become Mike. 

00:08:35
DANA (crosstalk) Right. I'll go there. Okay. 

00:08:35
AARON BECK And then after it's all over, I'm gonna ask you what you felt during the interview, Mike. 

00:08:40
DANA Okay. 

00:08:40
AARON BECK And the audience would like to know and if there was anything that I said that kind of turned you off, rubbed you the wrong way, which is important to know and also what seemed to be meaningful to you. 

00:08:55
DANA (crosstalk) Okay. Okay. 

00:08:55
AARON BECK Okay, now Mike, as you know, I'm a consultant. I've been called in to talk to you. Is that okay? You feel, feel all right about that? 

00:09:05
DANA Yeah, that's great. 

00:09:05
AARON BECK Uh-huh. And, um, so I'm gonna have to ask you some questions that of course if I had seen you before I would already know. Uh, Mike, just right now, what seems to be bothering you the most? 

00:09:15
DANA I'm frustrated. I, I keep going out, trying to meet these girls and I'm terrified. I get, uh, completely terrified and I know what I, what I need to do, um, and it's so stupid. I'd rather, I, I just, end up sitting home and staying home and doing nothing because I, I don't know. I, I don't know. Maybe that's what I need to be doing. Maybe that is really what I want to do and not, not even be, um, maybe I don't really want a relationship. 

00:09:40
AARON BECK Mm-hmm. 

00:09:40
DANA I don't know. 

00:09:45
AARON BECK So, from what you say, you're, you're frustrated. You're somewhat terrified about doing things. 

00:09:50
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:09:50
AARON BECK You think that a relationship might be good for you but you're not even sure that that's the way to go. 

00:09:55
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:09:55
AARON BECK Is that pretty much what it is? 

00:09:55
DANA That's, yeah. 

00:09:55
AARON BECK Now, have you, uh, since you got divorced, which I have heard about, have you had any new relationships? 

00:10:00
DANA Just people that I go and that I pay to be with me, and you know I've met some people in the singles ads and, um, and, uh, but I do have a sexually transmitted disease and, and, uh, I just don't think I'm worthwhile of, of meeting anybody. 

00:10:20
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Now is your concern that once you meet somebody, meet a woman... 

00:10:20
DANA (crosstalk) That I have to tell them. 

00:10:25
AARON BECK And so on that you'd have to tell them and this might turn them off. 

00:10:25
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:10:25
AARON BECK And you feel that you do have to have, have to have sex with them ultimately. 

00:10:30
DANA Yes. Right. 

00:10:30
AARON BECK Uh, if it's going to, uh, really? So you, you have a problem that you're kind of terrified in going out. Now we wanna see if this is totally based on you having a sexually transmitted disease or whether it's what we call a social phobia. You know what I mean by social phobia? That one is afraid of dating situations just because of fears of rejection and so on. 

00:10:55
DANA Right, right, that yeah, that. Because sometimes I think, you know I have told people and some people haven't rejected me because of it but, but, probably for the most part it's more like social phobia. Like, I just, I'm scared to go and to do the things it would take to meet somebody. Like it's, it's scary. I'm very frightened. 

00:11:15
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Right. 

00:11:15
DANA (crosstalk) Scared to death. 

00:11:15
AARON BECK So let's just see if we can eliminate the fear of the sexually transmitted disease part. 

00:11:20
DANA (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:11:20
AARON BECK Just for the moment, and then we'll come back to that. Because it seems as though you have a dating fear, which is independent of this additional fear that you have. Now, before you get married, do you have concerns about the opposite sex? 

00:11:35
DANA Well, mostly before I got married they wanted me. Like they would approach me, and they would come up to me and want to be with me, and I didn't really pursue, I've never really pursued anybody. It's mostly I've been pursued and, and that's when I was more in the bars and drinking and using more then too. 

00:11:55
AARON BECK Uh-huh. So, at the earlier part of your life, your whole problem acceptance and rejection was not a viable issue because people came up to you and so you never had to be concerned about rejection, is that correct? 

00:12:10
DANA What I think about is that my, my father rejected me a lot, tremendously. He used to be very, very abusive and beat my mom and beat me and I was like more like a momma's boy. That, that's where I felt more, um, I was very close with my mother and my sisters. 

00:12:25
AARON BECK Uh-huh. And your father used to beat you under what pretext? 

00:12:30
DANA Any. hHe would get drunk, and just, um, beat me or beat my, I remember seeing my mother, like laying on the floor and my father had beat her up and she was like laying there, and I think, I kind of, I lifted up her head or something, like saw her, um just, you know, beaten and it was for nothing. It was because my father was, um, just, he was drunk and into, you know, using and beating up my mother. He's not like my dad. He's like my... 

00:13:00
AARON BECK And your father also beat you up? 

00:13:05
DANA Yeah. He would, he would go out, mostly though, I was frightened and I, I wouldn't stand up to him or anything, and I would go like to the, to the back yard, we had this fence in the back and I would like, stand there and look into the alley and, and, like, just try and run away from him, like that. But I also feel like, um, you know, I should have just beat the shit out of him, or, or killed him or done something like that. 

00:13:25
AARON BECK Yeah. I'm gonna make an aside to the audience. It started off with a dating anxiety, and now full problem childhood trauma is coming into it, and the perception of self as not being a man based on the, uh, the father's type of thing. So, I wonder, how are these two related or are we getting onto another aspect, which may be quite important. And if we're just doing totally focalized therapy, I would say come right back to the dating anxiety, but I, I don't think that's proper. What we have to do is go with the flow and see if there's some connection, so, but the thought just occurred to me that if the father made him out to be a momma's boy and this got reinforced by his fear of confronting his father, this may be now affecting the patient. Now, I might be making these observations and they may be correct but I don't have to tell the patient everything I know. What I want to do is tell the patient thing that are gonna be useful. We don't try to show off if we're right or not. 

00:14:25
DANA Okay. Along those lines, um, uh, my, my father did tell me I was worthless and stupid and dumb all the time and my name was like dummy. And also when I date people, I think it is kind of related 'cuz when I, when I do meet people, women, I like women who are bigger than me, and I like them to take care of me and I like to feel, um, it's kind of like, very, uh, motherly but like, I always fit in their body, you know, like they're, taking care of me, so I think, I think maybe that's true, somewhat. 

00:15:05
AARON BECK So, does it seem to fit right now, Mike, that you have a real sense of inferiority and weakness? 

00:15:10
DANA (crosstalk) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Terribly, I mean that's bad. 

00:15:15
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Now, now, Mike, tell me if this makes sense to you. When you were small, we've already been over this but I wanna see if we can refine it, uh, your father beat your mother which made him into a terrifying person. He also put you down all the time, and there was always a continuous threat that he might beat you up, and so you see him as big and yourself as small and when you get into your adult life, even though you're just as strong possibly as your father, as strong as the next person, uh, the image of yourself is there's this little whimpering boy who's the mama's baby. 

00:15:50
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:15:50
AARON BECK Does that seem to, to fit? 

00:15:50
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:15:50
AARON BECK Is there anything... 

00:15:55
DANA And I was the baby in my family. My mother used to tell me she wanted to keep me in a jar and keep me little, and keep me, put me in a jar and put me on the shelf. 

00:16:00
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So do you think you're still in a jar right now? 

00:16:05
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm, very much. 

00:16:05
AARON BECK And, when you um, then go out with women who don't fit the stereotype of the tall woman, so on, do you start to feel small? 

00:16:20
DANA I never really went out with someone like that. I always like... 

00:16:20
AARON BECK (crosstalk) All right. What would be a typical woman that you've been out with, uh, recently? 

00:16:30
DANA Like, um, maybe like 5'10", five, you know like 5'9" to 5'11". I went out with someone almost six feet. 

00:16:40
AARON BECK Hmm. And what sort of personalities do they have? 

00:16:40
DANA Well, most of them, hmm, a lot, some of them drink and use, and those are the ones that I don't really like, and the ones I like, they're like, they'll get my food for me or they'll take care of me, like make me a plate at a party. Um, but I don't really date them that long. Like, I get very obsessive. I obsess, obsess, obsess, and then I like, I, I wanted this relationship with them and I pursued and then it never works out. 

00:17:15
AARON BECK And what seems to prevent it from working out, Mike? 

00:17:20
DANA I think I sabotage it. I think I, I end up, um, like kind of in some way, I believe it won't work out and then I just keep, then I do all these things like I might be rude to them, or I might get pissed off at em and say, "Fuck this. You know, I, forget it. I'm not calling her back." 

00:17:35
AARON BECK Mm-hmm. Now, do they do something that pisses you off? 

00:17:40
AARON BECK Yeah, like, they'll, they'll, like, tell me to get a life. One told me to get a life one time. Uh... 

00:17:45
AARON BECK They tell you to get a life? 

00:17:45
DANA Yeah. Like it was a joke. She said it like a joke like, "Get a life," but, but I didn't call her back. 

00:17:50
AARON BECK (crosstalk) And, and, how, how did you take that when she said that? 

00:17:55
DANA I said, "Fuck, forget you. You know. You don't go telling me to get a life. She was a drunk and I, I you know, I work, and I raise my kids, and I have a good job and I have lots of things but I just, you know, sometimes I think if I had the picket fence, it would be good, and sometimes, I think, uh, maybe I don't even want a relationship. 

00:18:15
AARON BECK And, uh, at the times you, you get pissed off at the other person, do you, um, does the person say something that hurts you? 

00:18:25
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:18:25
AARON BECK And what sort of other things, um, besides "Get a life," have people said to you that ended up with you breaking a relationship? 

00:18:35
DANA I, I don't know if it's so much they say something or I just like stop, like, like, once, I, I mean the last thing I can think of is I was supposed to meet this girl for lunch and then I didn't show up 'cuz I had to work into my lunch, and uh, and then I didn't call her for like a couple days, but then I called her and then she didn't call me back and I, I mean, probably she didn't call me back 'cuz, 'cuz she just didn't want anything to do with me. 

00:19:05
AARON BECK But It seems as though you're kind of going unconsciously doing things to sabotage the relationship, which is, does that sound correct? 

00:19:10
DANA I don't know if it's unconscious 'cuz I, I just don't think really, I don't think could have a good relationship. 

00:19:20
AARON BECK Yeah, and the reason you think you can't have a good relationship is what? 

00:19:20
DANA 'Cuz I, I just don't, I don't feel worthwhile. I don't feel, um, I feel worthless. I just, I have this terrible sense of not feeling good. 

00:19:30
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Now, I know that you are divorced. Did your wife have something to do with making you feel not worthwhile? 

00:19:40
DANA Oh yeah. She, she screwed around and, and screwed everybody, and the neighbors, the men and the women, and, and uh, my kid's friend's mothers, and she sat in the garage and got drunk and was totally unrespectable, and just, just a, she, she was just a tramp. Now she's, she's sleeping with that doctor that, that did the surgery on her. I mean, yeah, she, I don't feel very good. 

00:20:00
AARON BECK Now, when your wife did all these things... 

00:20:00
DANA She's a whore though. 

00:20:05
AARON BECK Sleeping around and, putting you down and so on, how did that make you feel? 

00:20:10
DANA Like, like shit. 

00:20:10
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Now, Mike, I'd like to ask you something, this may be difficult to do, but I wonder if you can put together the way your father was intimidating and made you feel sort of worthless, and also afraid of these big figures, the way he beat your mother and so on, and then the way your wife treated you, and then the fact that you felt like shit, can that cast any light on why you feel worthless right now? 

00:20:40
DANA Yeah, 'cuz I, I think I just didn't deserve anything good. I mean, I, something's wrong with me. 

00:20:50
AARON BECK Uh-huh. So the kind of the belief that you have is that people want to treated you this way. Your father wanted to beat up on you, put you down and so on, and your, uh, wife would not have dumped on you if you were a worthwhile person, if there wasn't something wrong with you. 

00:21:05
DANA (crosstalk) Right. 

00:21:05
AARON BECK So you do have that deep sense of something being wrong. 

00:21:05
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:21:05
AARON BECK Now, is it possible that what your wrong about is in feeling that something's wrong with you? 

00:21:15
DANA What am I, I'm lost. 

00:21:15
AARON BECK This is to confuse you. 

00:21:20
DANA You're doing a good job. 

00:21:20
AARON BECK Yes. Well, that's the idea. First, we get people confused, and then we get them to crystalize things. Um, it seems to me, it seems to me that, that one of the things, obviously what you just said is there's something wrong with you. 

00:21:35
DANA (crosstalk inaudible). Right. 

00:21:35
AARON BECK And, the basis for thinking there's something wrong with you is that all these things have happened to you, so when you try to explain why they happened you say, "There must be something wrong with me, rather than something wrong with them." 

00:21:50
DANA Right. 

00:21:50
AARON BECK So, something wrong with you why your father treated you that way. Something wrong with you why your mother put you in a bottle. 

00:21:55
DANA (crosstalk) Right. 

00:21:55
AARON BECK  Something wrong with you that your wife has slept around and rejected you. Now, is there some other explanation as to why all these things happened? 

00:22:05
DANA Well, what I wanna believe is like, that it's like something, like about them. But what I feel inside is, like, that it's about me, like, like really that, that I'm not good. 

00:22:15
AARON BECK (crosstalk) There's something wrong with you. 

00:22:15
DANA Or I'm not okay. 

00:22:20
AARON BECK Yeah. Now one of the things that might help you to kind of change this belief, which I think you might realize is, it's not a correct belief that there's something wrong with you. You, you probably realize that your father was a bum, your wife was a bum, your mother was overprotective, and all those things. 

00:22:35
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:22:35
AARON BECK So you probably realized that intellectually but it doesn't really affect this deep sense of worthlessness that you have and being weak and inferior, kind of a patsy pushover type of thing. 

00:22:50
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:22:50
AARON BECK Now one way to get at this is to actually go through an experience. Now, if we had time, what I would do with you is kind of role play one of the women that you're out on a date with, and then you would play yourself , and then you would see just what you're experiencing, but another way of going about it would be for you to image yourself on a date. Now, I wonder if you'd be willing to try this. Imagery is very often important getting at the emotions because there's not been any really emotional change, although there's been some intellectual appreciation of the problem. 

00:23:20
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:23:20
AARON BECK Uh, the imagery exercise, which consists of imagining yourself on a date, and then, the woman saying something to you, you taking it in a particular way, getting turned off, and then moving away. Um, now, when's the last time, uh, you had a date with a woman and you got turned off? 

00:23:50
DANA Well, like, the, like, like, this last week or two weeks ago with this new girl that I met at work. I went to lunch with her for a lot of days, and then, uh, she, then this thing, I didn't see her, then I ended up being on the same set and I promised myself I'm gonna go up, and, and meet her, and talk to her, and take her out and then I had to work through my lunch, so like last week. 

00:24:10
AARON BECK Oh, I see. That's the gal that you, uh, stood up. 

00:24:15
DANA Yeah. Yeah. Yes. 

00:24:20
AARON BECK (crosstalk) To, to get to the fact of the situation. You may have stood her up as an avoidant type thing but you don't know about that. How about the last time you actually had a date with somebody? 

00:24:25
DANA That she said something? 

00:24:30
AARON BECK Yeah, or you just had a date and, um, it didn't really work out perfectly. 

00:24:35
DANA Okay. Yeah I can think of the last time that was. 

00:24:40
AARON BECK What was the woman's name? 

00:24:40
DANA Uh, Laurie. 

00:24:45
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Now, uh, can you tell me a little bit about the way you were with Laurie? 

00:24:50
DANA Well, this I, like met her. I don't know if this was really a date 'cuz I, I met her and then, uh, we went out, and then what happened is I told her, I told her I had herpes and then she, she never called me back. 

00:25:05
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Now... 

00:25:05
DANA I didn't call her either but she never called me back. 

00:25:10
AARON BECK Right. Okay, now can you picture, uh, right now tapping into your memory, can you get a good picture of Laurie? 

00:25:15
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:15
AARON BECK And can you picture the situation as Laurie is there, and you're there. Can now picture yourself? 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:30
DANA Mm-kay. 

00:25:30
AARON BECK And as you picture yourself, what do you see? How do you appear? Do you appear your, your usual height? The way you are (crosstalk inaudible )? 

00:25:46
DANA (crosstalk) Uh, I was, no, I'm smaller and she's telling me I'm stupid. 

00:25:46
AARON BECK Uh-huh, so you're smaller than you usually are. 

00:25:50
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:50
AARON BECK But how small are you? 

00:25:50
DANA Like, uh, like shoulder height to like, uh to her, I'm kind of like, like this small, and uh... 

00:26:05
AARON BECK About like that? 

00:26:05
DANA She's like leaning over me. 

00:26:05
AARON BECK So, you're about a foot and a half? 

00:26:10
DANA Mm-hmm. Well like three feet. 

00:26:10
AARON BECK Oh, oh, like this. Three feet, okay. So, she's three feet which would be probably an age of, what, seven or eight? 

00:26:20
DANA That's how tall I feel. Like three... 

00:26:25
AARON BECK Yes. 

00:26:25
DANA Yeah. Yeah. Like seven. 

00:26:25
AARON BECK (crosstalk) So, now do you, how, how, do you have some kind of an age that's attached to this particular image? You're, you're three feet tall. Do you have a, a young face, baby face? 

00:26:35
DANA No, I have a, a man's face, I'm like, yeah. 

00:26:40
AARON BECK (crosstalk) You've got man's face and a child's body? 

00:26:40
DANA (crosstalk) Yeah. Yes Yes. That's how I feel, yeah. 

00:26:45
AARON BECK And what does the body look like? 

00:26:45
DANA Like a man's body but everything's small. 

00:26:50
AARON BECK Uh-huh, and, and how does she look now? 

00:26:55
DANA She looks like she's like leaning over me, like she's overpowering and overbearing and like, like, she's over me. 

00:27:00
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Now, Mike do you get that feeling with women now, that they're overpowering and overbearing? 

00:27:10
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:27:10
AARON BECK I wonder if now that you've had this visual image, if you can now accept the following idea, that when you're in relationships you feel like a small person. 

00:27:20
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:27:20
AARON BECK And If you're a small person, you're vulnerable, and if you're vulnerable it means that you can easily be hurt. And one of the ways in which you can be hurt is to be overpowered, to be put down, to be rejected, and you're just like a child, even though you still have these adult characteristics. You're like a vulnerable little child who can be pushed around, rejected, put down, and so on. 

00:27:45
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:27:45
AARON BECK In addition to which, you perceive yourself as a disease that'll bad, probably disease being bad, vulnerable type child. 

00:28:00
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:28:00
AARON BECK Now, does that really seem to fit? 

00:28:00
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:28:00
AARON BECK Now, what is the reality of the situation? Are you indeed just a small person? 

00:28:10
DANA No. 

00:28:10
AARON BECK How old are your children? 

00:28:10
DANA Uh, 6 and 9 now. 

00:28:15
AARON BECK You know how tall they are? 

00:28:20
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:28:20
AARON BECK More than 3 feet? 

00:28:25
DANA They're like around there. I mean, I don't know. They're, they're small. 

00:28:25
AARON BECK Somewheres around there. 

00:28:30
DANA Yeah. 

00:28:30
AARON BECK Now, when you take care of them, are you just a 3 foot adult? 

00:28:40
DANA No, no, no, That's where I, I know that I, I do a good job. 

00:28:40
AARON BECK So, basically you're a big person, but you feel like a small person. 

00:28:40
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:28:40
AARON BECK And your imagery indicates that you see yourself as a small person. 

00:28:45
DANA Right. 

00:28:45
AARON BECK So, you'll agree then, you do not see yourself realistically, but you feel small. 

00:28:50
DANA Right. Mm-hmm. 

00:28:50
AARON BECK And, but you don't think small so we have to do is get the thinking together with the feeling. Now, what I'm gonna ask you again is to image this, uh, image that you had before, but let's see if you can see yourself as you are with your children when you're taking care of your children. You are a good father. 

00:29:10
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
AARON BECK And when you're working on the job, you're a strong person, you can picture yourself as a real father, not a a 3 foot old father. 

00:29:20
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Right, not a, right. Right. 

00:29:20
AARON BECK Not a 3 foot father. Big 5'11" father. Right? And when you're working on the job, and you're 5'11" you can picture that? 

00:29:30
DANA 5'8" but... 

00:29:30
AARON BECK 5'8". 

00:29:30
DANA Yeah but I can picture myself... 

00:29:30
AARON BECK You see, it just shows you what a strong person you are. I, I overestimated your size. See how you come through to me. Okay. So you're 5'8", and your 5'8" on the job and you're 5'8" when you're with the children. 

00:29:45
DANA Right. 

00:29:45
AARON BECK But when you're with a woman, your 3 foot. 

00:29:50
DANA Yeah. 

00:29:50
AARON BECK Okay. Now, I'm gonna ask you something. It may be difficult but let's see if you can do it. I'd like to have you picture yourself with Laurie once again, but see if you're the same person who's a father and a good worker. Now you're, the work. Let's just say you've come out from taking care of your children and you're now seeing Laurie. Now describe what you're seeing in your image. 

00:30:15
DANA Well, I'm kind of walking around but I think I'm, I'm kind of arrogant. Like, I'm a, kind of an asshole when I go like that around women. 

00:30:25
AARON BECK Uh-huh. 

00:30:25
DANA You know, but I'm, I'm bigger, you know, and I've kind of like got, especially at work, I'm making jokes and you know, being that macho, like that Mexican inside that I'm supposed to be when I'm big. So... 

00:30:40
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you can picture yourself now as big and so then the next step would be to picture yourself as big but not an asshole. 

00:30:45
DANA Yeah, that would be good. That's the hard part. 

00:30:50
AARON BECK That's not gonna be so hard because we're going to have to do something before you can do that, and that is to now look at the sense of worthlessness that you have 'cuz one of the reasons you're an asshole is you're compensating for the sense of weakness. Now at this particular time, do you really believe that at this time in your life, you're just a pushover and a weakling like you were when you were a kid? Are you a mama's baby or not? 

00:31:15
DANA No, I'm not, not like, not, I know I'm not. I know I, I kind of, I think I feel or think that sometimes but I know inside I'm not that but I act like that. 

00:31:30
AARON BECK Okay, so I'm going to write this down. A little piece of paper, I'm gonna ask you to take this with you and every time you have a thought that I'm a weak mama's baby and I can't handle this and I have to avoid all them, I want you to look at this which is, I'm writing it right down right now. I am a successful parent. I'm a successful worker. I can manage things very well. That's number one. And number two, I am not a baby. And I'd like you to take that with you, and whenever you get those thoughts and really look for the thoughts, and every time you get this idea that you wanna avoid going out on a date, I want you to read this, and then in our next session, I'd like you to come back and tell me how it works. It's not magical. It may not work, but I really need to know what your reaction is to it, and once you've done that, then we'll be able to take the next step. Does that make sense to you? 

00:32:25
DANA (crosstalk) Okay. Mm-hmm. 

00:32:25
AARON BECK Now I'd like to ask you another question, Mike, which is really very important. Did I say anything during the session that bothered you in any way? 

00:32:30
DANA Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 

00:32:30
AARON BECK Now, what do you personally feel, Mike, that you may have gotten out of today's session? 

00:32:40
DANA Well like I, I need to, I need to tell myself more, uh, I guess that, that I need to remember like the good things because it's true, I am a good Dad, and I am that but I just get, this other part takes over. See, I'm still like over here, like going, how do I not, how do I, like, get a date and not be a jerk and be, uh, like how can I be like this like I can be with my kids and like I can be here with a, with a date? 

00:33:15
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, that's a very good question, so today what we were working on was what we call the self-image, how you perceive yourself. The next thing that we're gonna do is what we call social skills training which is to try to get you to see how you can handle women in the outside, and part of this is going through certain procedures which you didn't learn in your earlier days because the women used to come to you. So, it's a learning experience, but it's not hard. It's just to see can you ride a bicycle, drive a car? You can, can you work a computer. So, those things. It's a strictly learning experience. We'll do as role play, and I'll role play a woman and you role play yourself, and you'll be able to develop certain techniques, which will then make it much easier for you to approach a woman. 

00:34:00
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:34:00
AARON BECK So that sounds okay to you? 

00:34:05
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:34:05
AARON BECK Do you wanna come back next time? Give it a try? 

00:34:05
DANA Yeah, I'll be here. Okay. 

00:34:10
AARON BECK Fine. All right, well now for the purpose of the audience. We still have about a half hour. 

00:34:20
DANA No, I think about five minutes. 

00:34:25
AARON BECK Really? Is that, is that correct? The, uh, preceptor. 

00:34:30
JUDITH BECK Twenty minutes, 20 minutes great. 

00:34:30
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Twenty minutes. Okay, I think probably this may be the only role play we'll, we'll have time for, um so we'll just discuss, uh, what went on in here, and hopefully there may, we might be able to get some questions from the audience. 

00:34:45
DADA (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:34:45
AARON BECK I don't know if it's technically gonna be feasible. So, first I'm, uh, what's your name again? 

00:34:50
DANA Dana. 

00:34:50
AARON BECK Dana, I'm gonna ask Dana, when she was role playing Mike, what she felt and how she thinks I should've done things differently, so this will be a learning experience for all of us, 'cuz she was not only role playing a patient, but she's a therapist too, so she can give us some tips and we're always learning, and then Judy will kind of analyze the whole thing and we'll see what we can learn from Judy's observation. 

00:35:15
DANA Okay. 

00:35:15
AARON BECK Okay, Dana. Do you wanna start? 

00:35:20
DANA Um, playing him, it was interesting 'cuz, 'cuz, uh, I guess, uh, you've got a good sense. That was important, uh, to get a good sense of, of, um, what I think his experience is anyways as when, when I see him, um, and, and that was, that was helpful. There was one point and I'm trying to go back and think where I was thinking like I, I wanna, like go like one more level. I don't, I don't know how to explain it, like, I, I was, um, I guess the part that I'm still struggling with is this, this sense that I, I think goes on for him and making it, uh, integrating that, that feeling part that you were talking about or, or being able to, to actually make a shift but I guess that's what the assignment is. Is like to... 

00:36:15
AARON BECK Yeah. Now we might have time, now, to, to maybe go down to the next level, so let, let's get Judy's comment, and then maybe you might think of where that switch point is and we'll see if we can go a little bit deeper. 

00:36:25
DANA Okay, I'm unclear what I, but, we'll try it. Yeah. 

00:36:25
AARON BECK (crosstalk) We'll try. 

00:36:25
JUDITH BECK Well, this Dr. Beck had promised that he would do three things, which he did do. One was to develop a relationship with the client and I think he did that very easily and very quickly just by asking some questions and obviously showing some direct respect to the patient and accurately summarizing her experience so that, it seemed to me that he really had a sense of what you were saying and, um, what you meant. Then, he said that he would focus on a specific cognitive problem and make an intervention and very early on he got the sense that there was this sense of worthlessness that the patient has and she was, he was pretty forthcoming, the patient, in being able to express both how that affects him today and also some of the developmental roots to the problem. At the very beginning of the session, the, um, the therapist helped the patient recognize that there was either one of two problems going on. Either the patient really does have a social phobia in which case that's what they should work on, or perhaps it is that the patient doesn't have a social phobia but doesn't really want a relationship. And it seems obvious that it was the first but he was respectful in saying that perhaps it could be either one of those, and then he really threw out and started at the beginning, laid out a treatment plan and said well sounds like then first what we should do is to work on the social phobia problem, and then we'll work on the social disease problem, so he helped separate out those two things. Now, he allowed the patient to switch from the present to go into the past in order for both of them to have a clear understanding of where this sense of worthlessness came from, and then, but he always brought the past back up to the present, and one of the questions he asked was in, uh, relationships now, when you get pissed off, have they said something that hurt you, so that he could see again whether it was the sense of worthlessness that was behind all of the problems that the patient had. And then conceptualized for her why it is that she, why it is, why it is that he ends up feeling the way that he does. Um, he has this sense of himself as being very small, um, but not only small but small and vulnerable, and vulnerable to harm that he could be put down, rejected, pushed around. Then he had her imagine a very specific situation, a, a recent, specific situation, um, in which she felt small and vulnerable, and had her visualize it as if it's happening right now so that he could get the affect up a little bit right in the session itself. Because often times the cognitive change doesn't work unless the affect really is present and the patient was able to acknowledge that while he understands to some degree intellectually that he's not worthless, in his gut, he really feels that way. Now one, one first step to help the patient start to integrate what he's thinking with kind of this gut level almost feeling. It's not really a, a feeling as an emotion but it's extremely, deeply held belief is that every time he starts to feel that way, feel worthless is for him to have, uh, be able to turn on his intellectual mind by reading a card that they have composed together in the session, and I assume that in future sessions they might do some other techniques, for example, uh, rational emotional role play where the patient plays that gut level sense of himself and the therapist plays the more rational level. They might, um, do some early energy work, where the patient relives a traumatic experience that happened when he was a child and the therapist then can do work with the 4 year old child and do some cognitive therapy there in order to help integrate the intellectual sense with this gut level sense. 

00:40:25
AARON BECK Now, I, I think the other Dr. Beck made a very good summary of what this Dr. Beck was trying to do. The, um, the problem we have now that Mike, Dana, has said is the, um, bridging the gap between the intellectual knowledge and the actual experience, the change in the belief as Judy said. The beliefs change in the heat of emotion. We need the emotion to melt the dysfunctional belief. Now one way to go about in addition to what I've done already would be to go back to childhood as Judy had said and have him recreate a situation, which we can do. Um, the, um, the second thing would be to do a role play right in here so that again we can get the emotions up which would then facilitate learning. The third thing is the assignment I already gave, uh, when he goes out and actually experiences the emotion. Then, the heat of the emotion can help to change the belief provided there's a new belief to insert in there. And so the new belief would be I am a man. I'm a good parent. I can really do things. So that's the homework assignment, um. However, since there's still little time, we could probably either do a childhood type of thing or a role play, so I'm gonna ask Mike, uh, I can't quite see. 

00:42:00
JUDITH BECK Fifteen. 

00:42:00
AARON BECK How much? 

00:42:00
JUDITH BECK Fourteen minutes. 

00:42:00
AARON BECK Fourteen minutes, is that correct moderator? Right. Um, now, Mike, um, you know you're, you're quite correct in that why you can feel these things, see these things intellectually, it just hasn't filtered down, so that you get it emotionally and it can really affect the way you behave in situations. Now, part of the reason for this is that while you are an adult, and you have all the strengths that an adult has, there's still the problems from childhood that are still in you. Well it's just like an abscess and the abscess has a capsule around it, and so your new experiences of being a very successful parent and worker simply hasn't permeated down and indeed to the degree that we would like the intellectual knowledge that you're getting here hasn't really affected things the way we'd like, but there is another way of getting at this besides the role play that we did before, which had to do with the dating situation, and this would be either to recreate a childhood experience in which you were traumatized or for us to do a role play in here where I might role play your father and you would be a child or something like that. Now, do either of those two approaches appeal to you? 

00:43:25
DANA Um, yeah. I think I thought of, of a trauma, but I think I, I would be more comfortable doing the other one where, where, uh, where, like I think about my Dad calling me dummy. Hey dummy, come here. Dummy. You know. 

00:43:50
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Now would you like to do that in imagery or would you like me to play the role of father and you be your, little Mike. The real little Mike, not the Mike that you think you are. 

00:44:00
DANA Mm-hmm. Um... 

00:44:00
AARON BECK Would you like to do it in, uh, imagery or in role play? 

00:44:10
DANA Hmm. It's funny because I think of going to like, a, a role play 'cuz it's easier, but maybe imagery probably. 

00:44:20
AARON BECK Uh-huh. You'd be kind of inclined towards the imagery. Well, it's, we'll see how the imagery goes. 

00:44:25
DANA (crosstalk) I'm inclined to the role play but I should probably do the imagery knowing myself. 

00:44:25
AARON BECK Well, all right, well, we can start with the imagery. Maybe we can still have a little time for the the role play too after that. 

00:44:35
DANA (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:44:35
AARON BECK Now, uh, in the image, um, well tell us a little about the episode where your father was dumping on you and then we can... 

00:44:45
DANA You know, that's the thing. I think it's like, I can't think of like exactly one thing 'cuz my, my dad was always drunk. Um, but like anything that he wanted or anything he said to me, it's like, I, I just, you know, like I, I picture myself, uh, and him just saying, "Hey Dummy, come here." You know, "Dummy get this" or "give me the paper" or "get, you know, get me my slippers." 

00:45:05
AARON BECK (crosstalk) So, you'd be inside the home, and he, he would want something and he would say. 

00:45:10
DANA Yeah, like hey dummy, get me the newspaper. Like, he's sitting in his chair and he used to sit in this chair where he would get drunk, and, um, and then he would be drunk, and, and like he would want the newspaper. Hey Dummy get me the paper. That's what he said to me. 

00:45:25
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. And that would be one scene. Now what other things? How about the time when he beat up your mother? Do you remember? Do you remember how you felt then? 

00:45:35
DANA I remember wishing I could kill him. Like, I, I just wished I could kill him, seeing my mother laying there, and, um, laying on the floor and all bloody and I didn't know for sure if she was dead or not. 

00:45:45
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And how did you feel before you felt like killing him? Do you remember when you first saw her on the floor? 

00:45:55
DANA Afraid. Afraid, I was very terrified. I was terrified. 

00:45:55
AARON BECK So you felt terrified? And did you feel helpless at all? 

00:46:00
DANA Yeah. Like I didn't know, I just was like paralyzed. I was like... 

00:46:05
AARON BECK Uh-huh, and did you actually see him beat her up or just see her on the floor? 

00:46:05
DANA I saw him throw her down, I think. 

00:46:05
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:46:05
DANA Like I kind of remember him like push, pushing her head. That's what I remember. She was laying on the ground and she lifted her head, and I remember him slamming her head down on the ground. 

00:46:15
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Okay, well, would it be okay then if we, uh, wecreate this image? 

00:46:20
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:46:20
AARON BECK In fact you might have been having a little bit of it right now. 

00:46:25
DANA Mm-hmm 

00:46:25
AARON BECK About how old were you? 

00:46:30
DANA I, I think I was like 7. 

00:46:30
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Obviously you were small, 7 years old. 

00:46:35
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:46:35
AARON BECK Now, Mike what I'd like you to do is image this particular scene. You're at home and your parents are yelling iat each other. Your father s yelling at your mother and then you kind of know now what's going to happen after that. So the scene is going to be that you're hearing the parents yell at each other and if you can picture yourself and your two parents in this scene, then just raise your hand so I'll know that, um, uh, I'll know where you're at. 

00:47:05
DANA They're like yelling at each other, you know, and, and my dad's kind of by this chair. My mom's kind of standing by the, but I'm like down the hall, like, hiding. 

00:47:15
AARON BECK You see yourself down the hall hiding? 

00:47:15
DANA Mm-hmm, I'm like in my room, kind of moving behind, like, my bed, or like I was just like hiding but I could hear everything going on. I was thinking I wish I could just kill him. 

00:47:25
AARON BECK Now right now, as you're picturing it, can you experience as though it's happening right now, you're behind your, your, you're behind the bed. They're yelling at each other. 

00:47:35
DANA Right. 

00:47:35
AARON BECK They're yelling at each other and you're beginning to feel that you could kill him and you're scared. 

00:47:40
DANA Right. 

00:47:40
AARON BECK And now what do you see next? 

00:47:45
DANA I, I run out. my father leaves, and I run out. My mother's laying on the floor. Like, she's just laying there on the floor. 

00:47:50
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Can you see her there on the floor? 

00:47:55
DANA (crosstalk) Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:47:55
AARON BECK And what are you feeling right now? 

00:47:55
DANA I'm afraid. I've very... 

00:48:00
AARON BECK And you afraid of what? 

00:48:00
DANA That she's dead, maybe or that like, he's gonna come back and kill me. I don't know. I'm just, it's terrifying, like I can't even think of what I'm terrified about. I'm just, it's just... 

00:48:10
AARON BECK Uh-huh. You're afraid that he's killed her, he may have killed her and he may come and kill you. 

00:48:15
DANA Uh-huh. What he's gonna do. Yeah. 

00:48:15
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. And you're really feeling this all the way through? 

00:48:20
DANA No, it's like I'm, I'm describing it and I see it but I don't know what, um... 

00:48:25
AARON BECK You don't know what? What's gonna happen next? 

00:48:30
DANA Yeah maybe, I, I don't know. I just I'm stuck, I'm stuck, like I'm frozen. 

00:48:35
AARON BECK You're frozen. You're paralyzed. 

00:48:35
DANA Yes, I'm frozen and I don't know what, what I can do. Like I've, like frozen. 

00:48:40
AARON BECK You're frozen and you're helpless. 

00:48:45
DANA Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:48:45
AARON BECK And your father is still present. 

00:48:50
DANA He's like outside. I don't know. I think he's outside. I think he might come back. 

00:48:55
AARON BECK Uh-huh. 

00:48:55
DANA I don't know where he went. He's like not there right now, now I'm just scared. Like, I don't know what to do. 

00:49:00
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Yeah. Okay, Mike, now want to bring you back to the present, so what you've described is a traumatic childhood experience. 

00:49:05
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:49:05
AARON BECK I think that this traumatic childhood experience is still affecting you today and when you are in threatening situations, you go back to feeling like an impotent, helpless, frightened little boy. 

00:49:20
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:49:20
AARON BECK Now, what we need to do is be able to see yourself as you really are. We've talked about that before, but one of the best ways to do that is to have another image in which you are no longer the cringing little boy, but you're a strong person as you are in reality. You can stand up to your father. Now, this may be difficult to do but let's see if we recreate this scene, only now you are a grown up person, you're a successful father, successful person. You do your work. And now your father has beaten on your mother and you're gonna come in and you're gonna stand up to your father and tell him off, but you're not the little child anymore. 

00:50:00
DANA Now, I just pictured like, shooting him, like, killing him. 

00:50:05
AARON BECK Okay. 

00:50:05
DANA That's how angry I... 

00:50:05
AARON BECK Well, that's a lot of anger and what's ideal in life is to have control of anger. You can be angry at him, but that of course obviously is counterproductive to kill him, but there are other ways of dealing with him. 

00:50:20
DANA (crosstalk) All right. 

00:50:20
AARON BECK But, you can be cool. Come up, in this picture I want you to be cool. Come in and tell your father off and see how well you can put him into place. Okay. Now we're gonna go back to the situation. You see your mother is bleeding on the ground. You know your father is somewhere in the house and you're gonna do something about it. So go ahead and picture just exactly what you're doing. 

00:50:40
DANA Well, I picture walking in and I picture being able to like, like do something first, to, to like, like so he can't hurt me now, 'cuz I am still kind of scared of him. 

00:50:55
AARON BECK Uh-huh. 

00:50:55
DANA Physically. Uh, so, I picture like handcuffing him like somewhere behind there. 

00:51:00
AARON BECK You, you, you can picture actually putting some handcuffs on him? 

00:51:00
DANA (crosstalk) Yes, and then I could talk to him, like if he couldn't physically hurt me. 

00:51:05
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:51:05
DANA Ss, um, I guess I would, like, handcuff him 'cuz he's so drunk. 

00:51:15
AARON BECK Well, that's very, that's very good. So in order to handcuff him, you have to be a strong person. So you're not just a 7 year old, 3 foot tall kid. 

00:51:20
DANA Right. No, no, no, I feel like he's drunk and I'm, I'm like much more in control 'cuz I'm clear headed. 

00:51:25
AARON BECK You're in control of the situation because you're clear headed. 

00:51:30
DANA (crosstalk) Right. 

00:51:30
AARON BECK And you can handcuff him because he's just a slobbering drunk. 

00:51:30
DANA Right. 

00:51:30
AARON BECK He's not this big intimidating person anymore because, he just isn't and you're a strong person. 

00:51:40
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:40
AARON BECK And you can also take care of your mother too. 

00:51:40
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:40
AARON BECK She's bleeding, you can get her whatever she needs. Can you picture that? 

00:51:45
DANA Mm-hmm. Yes. So I, I, guess I, I just see, like, handcuffing him and like putting him back somewhere, more, making him watch me take care of her maybe, so that he could, like, see what he did. 

00:52:00
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. So you're now in control of the situation. 

00:52:00
DANA Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, and I would pick her up and, and, um, I guess I see myself just holding her. I feel bad for her but cleaning her up. 

00:52:10
AARON BECK Mm-hmm. 

00:52:10
DANA And, um, and, uh, maybe sitting her in a chair too, so that I, I, it would sit her down, and, and uh, make her listen to what I'm saying 'cuz maybe she needs to know how to say this to my dad too. 

00:52:20
AARON BECK (crosstalk) So maybe you can help her out too. So you'd be in a helping role just as you would with your children if something happened to them, you know, like the good parent. 

00:52:30
DANA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:52:35
AARON BECK Well, now Mike we've been through this experience and I'd be very interested in knowing how you view yourself right now. Do you see yourself... 

00:52:40
DANA Very powerful. I, I felt, um, I do feel powerful and I do feel... 

00:52:45
AARON BECK (crosstalk) You do feel more powerful? And, and you think you can go out and, and be a powerful, cool person and meet new women, and be a powerful person, not be sensitive. 

00:52:55
DANA I'll have a date tonight. 

00:53:00
AARON BECK What? 

00:53:00
DANA Yeah, I said I'll have a date tonight, maybe. 

00:53:00
AARON BECK Well, that's wonderful. Well, I'm, I'm sorry. I really have enjoyed talking to you. I'm sorry we have to stop now but I think you have a very good grasp on where you need to go from here. 

00:53:10
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:53:10
AARON BECK What do you think, Mike? 

00:53:15
DANA Yeah, that, um, that, I feel, you know what I feel like right now? I feel like whole, like there's like this complete part of myself that's not all fragmented and just, it feels uh, like it's combined... 

00:53:25
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Uh-huh. You're feeling like a whole person. 

00:53:30
DANA Yeah, I do. 

00:53:30
AARON BECK Uh-huh. Really? 

00:53:30
DANA Yeah. 

00:53:30
AARON BECK That's great. Okay, now we're gonna get... 

00:53:35
DANA (crosstalk) Yeah. Will you come home with me? 

00:53:40
AARON BECK Why not? Well, I, I think now for the windup we want to know what Dana felt, possibly the way Mike felt. We don't know yet, so you'll have to tell everybody. 

00:53:50
DANA (crosstalk) That would be good. Um, well, I can tell you that I felt, like in the, when I said there was like this other part. It was like getting to that piece, like being able to, um, to like process that, you know, like go there, actually go there like you did, uh, when you shifted and when I went as Mike to the, to the images. I guess that's, um, it's funny 'cuz I was questioning if I could do that and go there, being that I didn't have that experience but I, I guess I felt... 

00:54:25
AARON BECK It shows you can identify with Mike and that's very, very important part of the therapy. So, that's one important part, that Dana's able to really feel what Mike could do and would do and so on and she was able to image, and this is one of the critical things in therapy, to be able to do what Dana just did, and you have to kind of see things through the patient's perspective, but not only see them but experience them. Now we weren't just dealing in the present for the latter part of this interview. We were dealing with past experiences so that Mike could integrate them into the present and the best way is to really go back to the early experiences so you're not just talking about the experience, but you're feeling it. You're going through it once again. Then, the relearning experience can take place, so that reeducation involves much more than just an intellectual understanding. It requires a total emotional, emotionally cognitively basic reframing of the whole, um, the whole difficult thing. Does that, uh, sound right to you? 

00:55:35
DANA (crosstalk) Yeah, that, that, does and I think what happens, it's interesting anyway. I don't, I don't know, uh, if it's even related but at times there are so many issues going on that it feels that focusing on one issue is like so narrow that it's like letting, it's like, maybe not, um, looking at everything that we need to look at, or, looking at a wider spectrum, but I think what happened, at least my experience up here was that by doing that, it really did address the larger processed stuff that goes on where we try and look at themes all the time, I think focusing at least here made that apparent, more, more than I thought it would. 

00:56:15
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. And I think the thing you want to look for is this least common denominator, something that may explain the social phobia and whatever other problems he has and so on so if he can get at the self-image which in recent years I found to be more and more important, you can then branch out from there into the various other types of difficulties the person has. 

00:56:35
DANA (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. Right. It's like getting that sense and bringing it back here. I mean, it's that part... 

00:56:40
AARON BECK (crosstalk) Yeah, we're bringing back that. And if you can make the patient feel like a whole person, then you've already made a giant step, then you're ready for the next part which would be the, uh, social skills training, which is relatively easy, uh, and particularly since you're a woman and he's a man, uh, it won't be difficult for you to do some role plays and so on. Sometimes a group therapy works very nicely, uh, when various members of the group can role play with other members of the group. 

00:57:10
DANA Mm-hmm. 

00:57:10
AARON BECK (crosstalk) And, uh, and then other people can say you're either doing well or not. Well, in summary then, um, I see cognitive therapy and all psychotherapy as a learning experience but the learning has to be based on at least two major factors. One is establishing a collaborate relationship with the patient, and I would check all the time to make sure we're on the same wavelength and the second part is giving the patient a corrective emotional or cognitive experience, which will then modify the person's view of himself, uh, his future, and his view of experience, and that's the essence of cognitive therapy. 

00:57:55
DANA Thank you very much. 

00:58:00
AARON BECK You were wonderful. 

00:58:00
DANA That was great.
