00:00:15
 Is there something that caught your attention? 

00:00:15
 [non-English narration] 

00:00:15
 I felt that I have to defend myself. 

00:00:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:00:30
 Why do you felt that you have to defend yourself? 

00:00:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:01:25
 There are some points about soccer. I used to like but I don't like it anymore because it has taken my husband away from me. At home in Honduras he played soccer. Soccer was soccer. Her felt good because he got together with Hondureno friends. At this moment I'm not appreciating what is good for him, I'm thinking about what is good for me and my husband is not on the house. He is not with me, he with soccer. And then soccer is my enemy, I don't take part in it. It is my competition. It's the same with his friends. 

00:01:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:01:30
 So you would like to win. 

00:01:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:02:25
 His friends are not bad people. They are enemies because, when I', in my home and I want to be with my family, my husband is in someone else's house... drinking his bear and eating barbecue and playing with other children, not with my son.... and I am in the house with my child. To me, this is not a family unit. I don't have anything against his friends or football, but we are in competition and I want to win! I don't feel like I and winning when he leaves the house to see his friends. I feel like I'm losing. And I am not accustomed to this. 

00:02:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:02:30
 Is this something that didn't have your attention until now? 

00:02:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:02:45
 I didn't know they were rivals until now. I had an Idea, but not to that extreme. I don't know. 

00:02:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:02:50
 So you have more power than you thought in the relationship. 

00:02:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:02:55
 Could be... I don't know. 

00:02:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:03:05
 What gets your attention in this conversation? 

00:03:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:04:25
 Since the first meeting we had... I knew that when Daniel would go with his friends... we talked about this many times... I knew that she was unhappy because he was -- time with his friends. When you spoke of this I suggested they might come to an agreement. That he would stay with her some time... and sometime she will go with him to see the game. And sometime she will spend time with him and his friends. We talked about that and we came to an agreement. I saw the truth is that, he is alone when Amber goes away. We talked about this a few times. 

00:04:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:00
 It is very interesting for me listening... Like the group said, from the start a couple of things occurred. It's my idea that you were both going against the current. You married somebody from another country, from another culture, with another language. There is enough going against the current. After going against the current, who has the responsibility for the things in the house? Who is going out, I don't know. It's like you both want to reconcile very different things and it is very difficult because... because these things you want to reconcile are very strong. But the discourse of your generation is very strong... I don't believe it. I believe that the lifestyle that you have is difficult because something you don't want to take the --. And this brother Amber. I don't know if the stereo brother you much ( speaking to Daniel) I am surprise that you want the responsibility of little Daniel after seven years of training and earning $90,000 at some clinic around here. It's interesting to me. I get the impression that this is going against the current. From the time that you decided to become a couple it has been against the current. It's very difficult to go against the current. You find that in taking care of the house. It gets my attention today that you will be going back to the role of responsibility. I the past my work was writing. I had the idea to balance work and family. I'm not able balance both. I can't do it anymore. In the end you win something, but you loose something. It's my impression that it's difficult. There's just too many things going, to have a child, to go to work, to have a family. Seven thousand things, at the same time. Fifty thousand things and always one thing more. It's like one more thing throws it out of balance. You would like everything clean, without conflict, good. I don't know at what point in the experiment, a good experiment, not necessarily to protect the experiment of you being the father, and perhaps you're responsible for Danielito eight percent of the time and perhaps you as the mother work eight percent of the time. Just a second... You both know how you feel when you lose things. You're losing something doing the work of a man and you're losing something doing the work of a women. Somebody on the team says to you, "you're like a mother" but you're a father. You're the mother, but you work to support the family financially not like a mother. the person who is starting who has more, wins more. The contractor has the possibility of earning the entire salary for a family in a moment. 

00:09:00
 [non-English narration] 

00:09:00
 Yes. 

00:09:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:05
 Do you want to say something? 

00:09:05
 [non-English narration] 

00:09:05
 What happened is... 

00:09:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:10
 I think you're feeling what I said. 

00:09:10
 [non-English narration] 

00:09:10
 Yes. 

00:09:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:45
 I'm not completely buying the idea that you completely lower yourself to the role that -- have switched to the idea that you can return to the other role...while here you are with both roles. You're switching roles, but you want roles that you nicer really have had --. How many years have you studied medicine? Even before this in your country you were going against the current. 

00:09:45
 [non-English narration] 

00:09:45
 Yes, It was enough... 

00:09:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:50
 You married a "gringa" (foreigner)... 

00:09:50
 [non-English narration] 

00:09:50
 There goes the current! 

00:09:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:10:50
 Her friend and companions study things that takes less time to study. Isn't it so? Many friends, like Erika, are working. She studies to be a teacher. It was very fast. Since she studied medicine, it took a long time. She can't stay home because she owns a lot of money. I can't stay home because she go back to work. It's very difficult. And now, she's not able to stay home and it is devastating. If I went and providing for the family and paying for her studies... And now, there's no way I can repay the money even if I go back to work. Its very difficult. 

00:10:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:11:30
 And now it is very difficult with the couples as I discovered that have a lot of stress. People think that if you could return to your "prescriber roles: that stress would get less. Ask any other couple. It's not necessarily so. Like a recipe...It's not very interesting to return to traditional roles. I think about how can it be easier for you but I don't know. You two are going to go against the current for the rest of your lives. 

00:11:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:11:35
 It seems like it? Yes, it seems that way. 

00:11:35
 [non-English narration] 

00:11:35
 Against the current of other people. 

00:11:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:11:45
 I believe that we both want to be the best in the world and is this bad? No! I can do it! 

00:11:45
 [non-English narration] 

00:11:45
 What can you do? 

00:11:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:10
 I feel that if I gave 100% at the home than my work is going to suffer. I can't do 100% at both. I have to give less to one or the other. And for me, I want to give more in the home, therefore, work will suffer. I don't feel that I can achieve 100% on the both sides. 

00:12:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:20
 Who says it has to be 100%? Where did it come from? 

00:12:20
 [non-English narration] 

00:12:20
 Inside of me. 

00:12:20
 [non-English narration] 

00:12:20
 No who told you that? 

00:12:20
 [non-English narration] 

00:12:20
 My daddy. 

00:12:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:25
 Ahah. Your daddy! And does your daddy live with you? 

00:12:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:30
 No. Thank god, no. 

00:12:30
 [non-English narration] 

00:12:30
 I look at him and he looks competent. 

00:12:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:40
 You can make a face to the court and go to work and repay the loans. Your daddy too? your momma? 

00:12:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:05
 Nobody. Her father is a perfectionist in the house, he does all the work. HE washes the clothes, he... Her mom sits and watches him do it all. She wants me to be like her father. I am a person who is very different than her father. 

00:13:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:10
 Why do you think she married you? 

00:13:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:15
 For his Afro (his hair) 

00:13:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:25
 Why do you think she married you? 

00:13:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:40
 For the love of God. I love God, but I'm not so involved anymore. Only she is involved with her missionary work. It also was my dream but not anymore. I believe that this is the base. 

00:13:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:45
 Why do you marry him? 

00:13:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:50
 Maybe she doesn't know me. 

00:13:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:13:55
 At one time for the adventure 

00:13:55
 [non-English narration] 

00:13:55
 That was a bad question. You didn't ask yourself why? 

00:13:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:14:30
 I recognized that it was against the current. And also, I felt that there were many difference, but most importantly, we had very strong feeling about God and we were inseparable. 

00:14:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:15:15
 We live in a culture where the academics say that everything is binary. Everything is to one side or the other Man--woman, father--mother, working--working Everything is split and everything so in opposition I have the impression that perhaps in the project that you are making together everything is binary. Because everything is one way or the other It's like you question how you are conducting your life. An example of this is that a lot of Latin men wouldn't understand what you are doing. 

00:15:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:15:25
 Yes. This is very critical because in my culture, my friends always are not interested in these things. 

00:15:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:15:30
 Most other Latin men are without responsibility for childcare. 

00:15:30
 [non-English narration] 

00:15:30
 Yes. 

00:15:30
 [non-English narration] 

00:15:30
 Go back to other question. 

00:15:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:15:35
 Why do you marry me? 

00:15:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:15:40
 That's the question. 

00:15:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:15:50
 For the job that she was getting ready for and for the good person who she is. 

00:15:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:00
 What things are included in making her a tremendous person? Are you including in this that it took her longer to study medicine? 

00:16:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:05
 When we were dating she told me that she wanted to study medicine. 

00:16:05
 [non-English narration] 

00:16:05
 And what did you think about that? 

00:16:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:10
 I don't have any idea about how hard it would be. 

00:16:10
 [non-English narration] 

00:16:10
 What are you thinking at this moment? 

00:16:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:20
 It's good. We're reaching our goals. I could never go back. 

00:16:20
 [non-English narration] 

00:16:20
 Why do you live with her? 

00:16:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:25
 We love each other. I love her a lot. 

00:16:25
 [non-English narration] 

00:16:25
 Why do you stay with him? 

00:16:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:30
 I need the baby. 

00:16:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:45
 Only kidding! Because when we married I never thought that it would be difficult. We married for better or worse. 

00:16:45
 [non-English narration] 

00:16:45
 No one knows. 

00:16:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:20
 For better or worse... Then we both wanted to be faithful. We promised to be faithful to each other. That's it! And I love him. But there are moments when we don't love each other. Our love is profound but there are moments when we don't like each other. At the foundation we are together. 

00:17:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:30
 I want to ask another question before we finish. What do you appreciate about him? 

00:17:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:45
 I'm going to ask you too. What do you appreciate about him? 

00:17:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:18:55
 I appreciate that he takes care of little Daniel so well I don't know that we were going into an experiment. He is a good Daddy. Also, even though I feel conflict with his sports, I admire his abilities in sports because I don't have this. I admire him for the love he has for the family. His father died when he was twelve, and he couldn't continue with school he worked to support his family. This shows me that he is very dedicated. I see it. 

00:18:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:19:55
 She loves her family. She is a person with many dreams. She wanted to become a doctor to help people who had no money. She wanted to help as a missionary. To me this is very beautiful. She has a big heart. Money is not important to her. She has many qualities. 

00:19:55
 [non-English narration] 

00:19:55
 Too much. 

00:19:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:20:20
 Enough. She preaches the bible to her friends, although I don't do it. It's very important to me. I watch her, I follow her. 

00:20:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:20:30
 Your connection with God is through Amher? 

00:20:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:20:50
 Maybe, I have God in my heart. I don't have to go to church. She'll go to church even if I don't. It's important to her. 

00:20:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:21:00
 What happened in this hour that you didn't know or found interesting? 

00:21:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:21:30
 For me it was good that he heard strangers say that he does a good job with Danny. Now he can go forward because his friends don't support him. 

00:21:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:21:35
 Did you discover something today? 

00:21:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:22:00
 Yes. I couldn't believe that they were saying all of those nice things about me. It was very interesting to me. 

00:22:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:22:25
 He thought that going to counseling that they would be on my side. "I don't want to go to counseling. They'll said with you. I'll be alone." And, they sided with him. We're trying to find a compromise. 

00:22:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:22:30
 I have nothing more to say. Do you have anything to add? 

00:22:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:22:45
 Well, I am very glad that they could come because they found other points of view. 

00:22:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:23:20
 A conversation like this makes it possible to have somebody else's point of view. Good luck to you. 

00:23:20
Epilogue 

00:23:20
and 

00:23:20
Afterthoughts 

00:23:20
 In the case of Daniel and Amber. I think it is of emigration, raze, language and religion. And specific life cycle moment. I mean specific transition in their family life. They are sort of like all intersecting. One of the pieces that and this is what I mentioned toward the end of the interview is this idea of how a couple that find themselves, that couples might try to resolve a particular conflict by going back to fairly to traditional gender roles. And in the case of this, I try to define what they do as counter attack, and that their relationship has always been countered, but when they find themselves dealing with the stresses of family life and balancing, balancing in quotes, work and family they seem to be longing for a traditional relationship. Men working outside the home and the women staying at home and taking care of the kids. There is several pieces that irrelevant in this interview. One of them is that, obviously being able to work in -- and having the capacity to also listen to them in English if it is necessary and to play around with those with the language. It is very helpful and in itself generates a joining process that can be very quick and faster than the usual. One of the things that I say at the very beginning to the couple is that I tell them in a joking way, that we will cancel the session if they are in a very difficult situation. And I use humor throughout the session and around some serious difficulties. But I use this humor as a way of joining and also a way of having a different understanding on what's going on. Not as a way of laughing at them, but are laughing together about what we are talking. I investigate besides asking them, what would be helpful. I ask them about the history of the relationship and the history of coming to the session. Which is not unusual in an interview. I ask them about how they make sense, how they decide to attend therapy, why were some of the pieces that brought, make them decide to do that. And a piece that, let me highlight some pieces that are important. One of them is this notion of what is that in culture of a couple in this case Latino male and a white women. What are they supposed to do in that relationship, and how in this particular couple the male is doing something that is not so typical, he is basically taking care of the child, and she is working outside home. And that in a way that piece is the second part of this counter mode, this counter discourse. And because in the first place when she goes abroad and in a way that this relationship with him, she is also doing something that is counter. She is selecting to become a physician basically for, I would say religion reasons, she really wants to help others and she embrace this relationship with this person and observing the interview. This is a couple that is orphan of an alternative discourse about how was that men and women should behave in a relationship when they are doing things that are sort of counter stereotypes about what they should do. I this case what men should do, what women should do, or why women should do, what Latino male's should do, what a middle upper-class women should do and what an immigrant from Central America should do. Clearly in the -- as the interviews progress, issues of class come up, and I ask about those as well as I explore the possibility that color, the skin color may have some importance although that doesn't seem to go anywhere during this interview. But I bring it up. I also saw the relationship with the religion, if it's a relationship with the introduction or we got itself. I mention the class barriers, the language barriers, the religion and I acknowledge the cultural aspects of the relationship. I ask a question midsession about who is the more powerful in the couple, and both decided that Amber is much more powerful. And I bring this question as a way of opening up the issue of power beyond just a couple. But also in terms of how is that raise again class and gender intersect. And it is very interesting because towards the end of the session, we -- they said to actually de-construct this idea that he is less powerful. In a way he is taking care of the child, in a way generates some power in the relationship. It means that he has some stakes in the relationship. An assumption that I have in my mind, is that we live in a patriarchal society and therefore being contract to that can create trouble for the couple. I ask them to envision how could this relationship be different, and it is at that point that Amber starts to cry because, she feel guilty about not being the one who is staying at home. Basically she thinks that if she were to stay at home and be the traditional women. So to speak that there wouldn't be any trouble. And in a way he seem to agree with this, but they have a discussion about what it will mean in terms of what would be the financial impact of this. Basically this discussion is again sort of not being anchor to a different kind of discourse. Some seem that really de-construct that which we have. I spoke with them the history of the immigration and how we say that he comes from, he starts to learn a new trade coming from a sea town and how easy that he has have to, basically add that here in United States and in the process, develop relationships with people that are not the same ones that Amber and his wife relates to. And this is an aspect of the therapy that may need work in the future. How it is going to bridge different kinds of friendships based on social class. He has friends, there are blue color and she has friends who are basically in the MD community. One of the things I noticed in the case of the team is that, the team tried to be very supportive of him and very much sort of very appreciative of his work, and with the child and this is noticed by Amber. Because she says that she thinks that needs to be defended. I want to defend myself, and I actually say to her, I will defend you as a way of balancing some of what she sees as the empathy that he generates among us. And I think that some of that empathy comes from you know a strong stereotype about what you say that, how does the Latino males behave. So if a Latino male starts to behave differently, everybody say ahhah, wow, that's incredible. And in the process we may lose a sign that some the conflicts and problems might be, that he is actually not necessary doing all work he may need to do to break with that pattern. And that he actually might be discontent with some of the things that he has to do. The end of the session it's basically validation of their kind of relationship and how sort of they have kept tried to construct a couple that is counter, that is counter to the discourse of our gender and about couple in general. In terms of the obvious, you know inter country inter language marriage, that also in terms of who is in charge at home and who does what. The other discourse that, it's complicated for a couple in this situation and this is not necessarily only the case in couple. Is this idea of balancing work on family, which isn't itself a very constraining discourse, and it is very difficult to carry on with work and family tasks. But also it becomes more difficult when we also have to try to make it all perfect. We have to be happy doing both, we have to be able to balance it and that creates a huge pressure on couples. One of the things I offer to this couples is to say that this counter project that they are creating is not something that they are doing on their own, that the other couples who are trying similar things that also trying to do things that are countered to the dominant paradigm about how a couple should be. In summary, I'm dealing here with a couple that is trying to work through a project that is countered to dominant discourses about gender, ethnicity, couple hood in itself. A challenge by the problems that inter culture interactions generate; it is challenged by easy use of raise, of class, of course of language. And as it goes through a transitional process, raising a baby, they find that there is no available discourses that show them that is healthy to do it this way. So the therapy could be an opportunity for validation of this project and for the de-construction of the conflux that they have as been not necessarily anchor in the -- in their vision for the future that anchor in some expectation they think they should comply with.
