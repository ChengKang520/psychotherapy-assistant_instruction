DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit, a foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is Happiness demands acceptance and commitment. We all need to examine our spiritual wellbeing along with any trauma recovery program and deep within inside of ourselves, how do we capture feelings of contentment, appreciation and deep happiness. My thoughts about this take me to my early training and how I was working so hard at becoming a clinical psychologist. I was living on a very small income that I received from a scholarship I received. I remember trying to cover all of my expenses on this tiny stipend. It was not always easy. I recall living in a one bedroom apartment and having to furnish a very small space, the least expensive things I could find. While all of these was going on, I was meeting with clients. They tell me that they wanted to get better or back to work, impress their boss, improve their relationships, find a spouse, leave a spouse, retire, buy home or sell a home. And if I continue to ask them about why they wanted any one of their goals and we peeled back the layers of all of their surface desires, they would always, everyone of them finally began to speak about their deeper, more meaningful desires of the heart that were at the core of their being. They would speak of a desire of peace, quiet and ease and eventually happiness. These are spiritual goals, the goals of a deeper nature, deeper than any surface goal could satisfy, goals that require us to learn about being okay exactly where we are in this moment. Deepak Chopra is a spiritual teacher who describes happiness as a subjective state of being which is pretty clever because this means that we get to define what makes us happy. I remember as a student, being essentially much poorer than most of our clients and are happy, excited, delighted with my studies and everything that I was learning. I felt pretty wealthy in a deep sense driven by something beyond the surface inexplicable. Miks McHailey(ph) a psychologist wrote about flow an experience of being able to deeply in the moment of our lives, very deeply into the activity you are engaged in and this again creates the subjective state of happiness. Amazing! Because these ideas suggest that we don't really need anything specifically to make us happy. Rather we can allow ourselves to be happy by not insisting that things go a certain way. Now, this is not to suggest that, we shouldn't plan or become effortful in certain activities in your life, but rather that it's okay if you allow yourself to be okay with exactly as it is in this moment, while you are moving toward another goal, if you have a goal. The Buddhists examine the idea of happiness and it's incredibly interesting and applies well to recovery from trauma as well. The Buddhist teachings of the four noble truths go something like this. As we go through life, we all experience suffering. We all experience life's difficulties and challenges. We age, we lose people, we love and eventually, we become ill and we die ourselves. The second noble truth is we suffer because we get attached to stuff and we… we all need to accept these losses and learn to release everything that grasping or clinging to things that are past or are no longer available create suffering. And the next one is, we recover from much suffering when we learn to let go of the things that we are attached to. This truth is essentially about no longer longing for things you cannot or do not have right now. And then the middle path in life, the one that allows the greater ease, is one that allows us to let go, but also to be engaged in life making goals that we are not attached to, remaining in the right state of mind, action, livelihood, effort and being. And this is the ultimate of being intentional about our behavior, thoughts and holding ourselves to a standard of action that we can feel good about, at ease with, being at peace with inside of ourselves regardless of what is occurring or not occurring in our lives. It is what it is. Acceptance and commitment therapy is not a great approach for understanding this and at the heart of this approach is the ability to truly and fully accept what is and live life in a way that feels peaceful. It's a practice. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
