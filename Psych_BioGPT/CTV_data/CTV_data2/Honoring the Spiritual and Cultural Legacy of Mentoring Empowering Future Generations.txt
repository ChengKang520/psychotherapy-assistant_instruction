00:00:50
MARIE MIVILLE I'm so proud and honor to introduced this year's Janet E. Helms mentoring award winner. Dr. Nancy Boyd-Franklin. I've-- I've known Nancy personally for nearly a decade and her work of course from the time I entered the field of counseling and psychology. As some of you may know I actually have the honor of working with Janet Helms the, ah, award, ah, the name of who the award is named after. Ah, she was my mentor when I was a doctoral student. And so I am really very well acquainted with the kind of person who exemplifies the greatest honor the roundtable can bestow on any single individual. As you may have read in her bio Dr. Boyd-Franklin has done it all in our field. She's written pioneering books on topics never before address in counseling and psychology particularly her work with Black families home and community base interventions and the need to be inclusive of spiritual needs of our families. Indeed one of the phrases that Nancy often uses to describe the power of prayer, prayer warriors actually deeply resonates for me even at this moment. Because right now I have my own prayer warriors focus on the success of this conference. As to knowing such things always slips my heart and helps keep my feet moving forward. I got to know the kind of person Nancy is truly particularly during on difficult times we went through her in the college a few years back. Nancy was one of those individuals who voluntarily came forward and said to me Marie whatever you need for the Roundtable just let me know. Now this is a busy person she doesn't even live New York she lives over the river in New Jersey. With many many things going on her own family to care for and still I felt Nancy was absolutely sincerely going to be your fro the Roundtable in anyway she could. And so indeed and yet another pioneering effort Nancy help found the pathways to practice form that we have tomorrow, ah, at 12:30 and it continuous very successfully today. And so with this with great joy that we hear at the Roundtable can find some way to honor this very special lady who gives first and without thinking of herself the recognition for not only all she's done but all of who she is, Dr. Boyd-Franklin.

UNKNOWN Good afternoon. 

00:04:00
DR. NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN Thank you. I just wanna give praise to God for just an amazing award. This is, ah, to God be the glory. Ah, this is just so powerful for me, uhm, for those who, ah, are here who are, ah, a part of this Roundtable I just really wanna thank you for this award, ah, to Dr. Marie Miville, uhm, you have done a magnificent job with it. Uhm, and I-- for me it's very meaningful that this is the Janet Helms award as many of you know, Janet is, uhm, very close to AJ and I. She's, ah, like AJ and doubt share at Boston College and she has taken very good care of AJ in Boston. Uhm, and she has just meant so much to all of us so to receive an award in her name and her honor for me personally is huge. Uhm, but I also want to acknowledge that this is the 30th anniversary of the Roundtable the big three O folks, uhm, I was here in 1983 in a snowstorm, ah, for the first month. Uhm, is Sam here yet, is Sam Johnson here yet? Ah, I just want to acknowledge, ah, the folks who came before us who help to create this, ah, Dr. Sam Johnson who put together and started the first Roundtable. Ah, Dr. Robert Carter who, ah, invented, developed and honor Janet Helms with this Janet Helms award. Uhm, Madonna Constantine, who took the torch from Robert and passed it very capably to Dr. Marie Miville. Uhm, where are the coordinators? Are they in the house? They're working, ah, I just wanna thank them they really get us through this process and you know there's an old African proverb that always comes to my mind at this times and that is that I stand on the shoulders of giants can I hear a name meant on that. Ah, this is really powerful. You know, never take this Roundtable for granted. Ah, let me repeat that never take this Roundtable for granted. Uhm, some of you know I was a doctoral student 40 years ago, may 40 plus who knows. Uhm, here at Teachers College and at that time there were no, none, zero persons of color on the faculty in the clinical or the counseling site department. And my-- some of you know my favorite book at that time was by Bob Guthrie, ah, it's about the history of psychology it's called Even the Rat was White. And, uhm, for many of us if you went to APA and you saw a person of color and I know you all some of you all can remember this, you run up and hug that person because you weren't sure if you would see another before you left the conference. So for those of you can come to this conference and meet the giants in your field up close and personal. One of my student said to me this is a big conference, I say, honey try APA. You know, this is just an intimate opportunity to really connect with, uhm, folks in the field. And I-- so don't ever take this for granted. Let the coordinators and Dr. Miville know, ah, just how wonderful this is for all of us. Now, I am gonna talk today about honoring the cultural and spiritual legacy of mentoring. And about empowering the next generation. And I decided that if I was gonna get the award of a trail blazer and a courageous sister in the struggle like Janet Helms that I was gonna take some risk today. So I want you to pray for me because I'm gonna talk from my heart about who I really am and about the, uhm, mentoring and, uhm, support that I have receive over the years. And, uhm, I'm-- I decided to do this because, ah, those of you know me-- know the personal parts. But there are many students here who only know of. And so I wanna give those, ah, personal parts to you today. And I wanna start just by honoring family. Now say some of this again later cuz some of my family is coming to the actual award later. But I wanna start just by, uhm, honoring and recognizing my soul mate, my husband, Dr. A.J. Franklin won't you stand up A.J. I know they know who you are but stand up. Uhm, folks you have A.J. has been a mentor to me over 35 years we mentored and supported each other. Uhm, we've raised children together, we've written together. Ah, we've held each other hands when were nervous before this kinds of big events. Uhm, in case a students don't know the nervous stop never goes away you just talk through it. Uhm, but, ah, I really, ah, thank A.J. for all of his support over the years, uhm, ah, for those of you for the young folks who haven't chosen a partner yet make sure you choose somebody who is as committed to your career as they are to theirs that's A.J. Franklin. Uhm, so I love you. Uhm, I wanna acknowledge the children of my heart, ah, Deidre, ah, Tunde, Remi, and Jay Franklin, uhm, who just have taught me so much about life. Ah, and my grandchildren. Now anybody who knows me, knows that to you I maybe Dr. Nancy Boyd-Franklin to them I'm grandma Nancy. And, ah, a (inaudible ) who you'll meet a little later, ah, Kaylan and Jelanie(ph), and Kyra(ph) and Kyla(ph) today is Kyra's(ph) birthday. And we've been texting her, uhm, next generation know I've finally learn how to text my, uhm, 6 year old granddaughter taught me last year. Uhm, but I also I wanna acknowledge some of my, ah, important people in my life and tell you about them. Ah, so just bear with me. Uhm, one of the first groups of people-- now you'll noticed there are a lot of overlapping people in my life. Ah, they, they come into my life from many different sites. But the first group are my after family, are my sister friends. Now those of you who know African-American culture know that sister friends are very significant. Can I hear a name it, all right. They are let just say I am afraid of today. Uhm, ah, my Joan Tatum(ph) who is my prayer partner has been for over 201 years. Ah, Rosemary Allwood who is a dear and close friend, she moved to Atlanta some years ago. We talk every other day on the phone. Uhm, Janis Sanchez-Hucles who just lost her mom and couldn't be here but Janis was my college roommate folks that was 40 plus years ago. And, uhm, she is accredited with introducing meet to A.J. so hey, sister friends are good in the house. Ah, Dr. Shalonda Kelly from Rutgers whose office is a couple doors down from mine and who keeps me sane, ah, when stop happens. Uhm, Bev Greene who just is an amazing sister just revolutionized the field. And, uhm, you don't have to be of the same race or culture, you don't have to look like me to be a sister friend I wanna acknowledge Dr. Brenna Bry from Rutgers. Uhm, when I first came to Rutgers Brenna said to me, you know we are both at heart those of you who us communities psychologist. And I was very worried when I took a job in the Ivory tower. I was afraid that I was gonna be removed from the community work that I love. And she said, "Well don't worry about it will start a community intervention program." I'm like, "Yes." So 20 years ago we started the Rutgers Somerset Counseling Program and I am here to testify it is still going strong today. Uhm, so hands off to Brenna. Uhm, but I wanna just say, ah, a little bit about mentors. Now that's a big word but, uhm, you don't have to be an old man with the grave bird to be a mentor. Can I hear a name here? All right. Common guys lose enough. Ah, I need some support up in here. Okay. Uhm, you don't have to have a doctorate to be a mentor. All right. As I'll tell you in a few minutes my mother believed that mentors were angels that God put in your path to help you along the way, all right. Uhm, so I wanna begin, uhm, and go forward by thanking, uhm, the people who have mentored me. And I wanna start with my parents and grandparents, uhm, my mom, ah, her name was Regina Boyd but everyone called her Gin, ah, those who know me, ah, the joke is that I have the Gin-gin that's a long story I'll tell you later. But, uhm, my mother was one of my first mentors in fact my mom was, uhm, the person responsible for the spiritual mentoring in my life, uhm, as, uhm, ah, Marie acknowledged earlier-- my mother was a prayer warrior, all right. Uhm, for those of you who are not as familiar with African-American culture that meant that my mother would pray for anybody. In fact if you came into my life before mom past on in 2005, chances are my mother prayed for you, all right. Now let me show you how this goes. I talk every morning to my mom on the phone and I would just say, "Mom, ah, lift up so and so." She's defending her dissertation. Or lift up so and so, his going up for 10 year today, all right. Or lift up so and so, his got a diagnosis of cancer. And mama pray so chances are my mother prayed for some of you up in here and you didn't even know it. Uhm, but my parents, ah, my father Rudy Boyd, ah, like many African-American men was a high school dropout but he was a brilliant man, all right. He taught me everything I know about racism, all right. I remember, uhm, now some of you know the truth of the story my family was not too happy to have a psychologist in the family, amen, common some of you have been there, all right. I've been or even more horrified when I tell them back in the dark ages you have to go in therapy before you got your degree, all right. And I tell them and I would not too happy about that. But my father was my cultural and racial mentor, all right. Uhm, for those of you, ah, who remember I, I remember coming home from undergrad in the 1960s, and very full of myself and bubbling on about internal and external locus of control. You know, I'm talking about well it wasn't-- when something happen was it me or was it racism. Honey 1 day my daddy said to me, said baby, when you have to wonder is it you or is it racism wonder first if it's racism at least it will preserve yourself-esteem this was from a man who was a high school dropout folks this is huge. Uhm, so remember that your mentor is don't have to have doctorates that's one of my big messages up in here today. Uhm, also I can remember sake you know, I grew up in the 50s and 60s, I was born before brown versus the board of education folks. So a lot of the word was still very segregated and very racist. It is today too it's just gone underground but that's another lecture. Uhm, I remembers saying to my parents will racism ever go away? And I remember my father said to me once he said, "Well baby there's good news and this bad news. The bad news is this probably not gonna go away in your lifetime. But the good news is you get to take it apart everyday of your life brick by brick to make a better world for your kids and grandkids." This from a man that didn't have a high school diploma. Amen. Uhm, parents thought how many of your parents taught you to give something back to those who were less fortunate, all right. My folks preach the staff, all right, that if I would-- well not if there was no if. When I was lucky enough to get this degree I had an obligation to give something back to my people that was the message. That you've wonder about my scholarship well that's my way of giving back. You wonder about my mentoring well that's my way of giving back to all those who've given to me. And they taught me that the most important reason you're on this planet is to make the difference. Now that's some powerful mentoring folks, all right. Ah, I'd like each of you to just meditate a little on that word making a difference. They taught us another thing, you know, when we were growing up nobody promise us a crystal stair. Nobody promise us a rose garden. Uhm, I grew up in a time of struggle and a time of civil right sand Black power and, uhm, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X and I remember I remember my parents and more importantly my grandmother telling me the hope is in the struggle let me repeat that. The hope is in the struggle as some powerful mentoring. So along the way when I was ensure why all this stuff was comment at me I'll just write 25 times the hope is in the struggle. Uhm, make sure you make a difference in your lives and your careers. You know, they-- back in the day when A.J. and I were growing up parents actually taught you how to deal with racism. And I am so thankful for that mentors in the house a lot of young people have not been taught how to deal with racism, sexism, homophobia that's part of our job now because somebody a parents didn't know they had to teach them, okay, that's part of our job now. And many years later, uhm, A.J. and I wrote a book together called Boys into Men Racing Our African American Teenage Sons. And we gave it a fantasy name we called it racism inoculation, all right. But that just a fantasy name for talent it like it is. Our parents taught us that we might get discriminated again in fact we would get discriminated again so if you wanna know the truth, all right, But they also taught us how to deal with it. They taught us that we were worthy that we were somebody and that we could go on and give something back. They also taught us not to forget where we came from to remember our roots. Uhm, as many of you know, I'm a New Yorker even though I live across the Hudson. Ah, I was born in Harlem not too far from here does Teachers College know now that its in Harlem. It didn't when I was here many, many years ago. But anyway, hey, ah, I was born in Harlem and raised in the Bronx in a low income housing project called Bronxdale, how many of you all know Bronxdale? You all know Bronxdale you just haven't made the connection. Uhm, the other person of many to come out of Bronxdale was the first Latino to serve on the supreme court Sonia Sotomayor they. So Bronxdale was something in the word of folks. Our parents believe in us and they made sure that made a difference. My, ah, mom and all of other African-American mom who help raise me taught me how to balance career and family. Now if the chi-- ah, my students ask me all of the time well ho who you balance career and family? Well the truth is every African American mother that I knew growing up magnificently balance career and family. They didn't know it was a choice, all right. And they did it with a lot less help than we do today. Uhm, one of my favorite sayings all of my students have heard it they probably yawning by now. Uhm, ah, all of those I've mentored over the years have heard it as you can have it all you just can't have it all at once. Ah, let me repeat that write this down you can have it all you just can't have it all at once. Sometimes you got to wait a little bit, all right, to get through the hard times. Now I wanna also talk for just a moment about tears. Yes, I did say tears, crying. My, ah, family taught me a great deal about tears. This is for some of you out there you know, who you are, all right. Uhm, my parents taught me to have the courage to talk through my tears. Now some of you know the story but I'll tell it for the younger people. Uhm, how many of you remember the back in 1975, the city of New York almost went bankrupt, all right. Some of us are still waiting for our paychecks from that period, all right. Uhm, but during that time they close programs all over the city, all right. They close hospitals, and I was in my first job as a psychologist at a major psychiatric hospital. And they close my unit and disperse the clients all over the place and laid off my entire staff. Now how can I put this gently. They had one very angry Black woman on their hands let just put it that way. So I stormed into the office of the, uhm, head of the hospital and gave him a piece of my mind and told him what I thought about this callous closings. And to my horror in the middle of that I burst into tears this is your own worst nightmare, all right. Come on let's have some, Amens, up in here. I know some of New Yorker got this. Uhm, and I so I on my way home I drove by my parents' house and I told them what had happen and I was mortified I mean just modified capital M, all right. And my parents look at each other and then they look at me and they said something to me that I have never forgotten. They said, ah, baby you cry when you're happy, you cry when you're sad, you cry when you're angry. You cry when you're passionate so you just smile as well learn how to speak through your tears. Or you're never gonna have the courage to get anything said, all right. Now I-- write that down folks this is huge this is mentoring, all right. Uhm, but I, I say this for two reasons one is that you can tell I'm very emotional about receiving this award today. So we don't wanna have to pick up pull anybody off the ceiling if I cry a few tears. I promise you I will talk through my tears. But also I'm saying it because they're maybe somebody out there who has allowed their emotion to silence them from speaking out, from having the courage to say what they've got to say. This one is for you, amen. Okay. I wanna talk about the other kinds of mentoring messages my family gave me. Uhm, you know, my folks, uhm, psychology was a mystery to them they had no clue how you go about getting a career. In psychology so, uhm, they sat me down 1 day when I was here at TC and they said listen, you gonna have to find a professional family I think of it as a professional extended family. Uhm, because when I can't be able to help you with a lot of the decisions you have to make. Uhm, what a gift that was, uhm, that was cultural and spiritual and family mentoring. Uhm, you know, functional African American families when they move to a new place they adopt people well that's a professional extended family. If you all don't have one yet start at this conference get phone numbers, get email addresses, uhm, because they are people here who for whom somebody did that and they will give it back to you. Uhm, also, ah, wanna acknowledge another mom in my life A.J. mom, ah, Mabel Franklin, uhm, and Mabel as a family how to come together. How to be a blended family. She didn't believe in x's, she didn't believe in staff she believe that it was all family. Well she's been smiling down from heaven because she got her witch. But she also taught me something else. Uhm, moms favorite hymn, uhm, many of you know it I'm gonna paraphrase and it was also by the way one of Martin Luther King Jr. favorite hymns. Uhm, if I can help somebody as I travel along then my living will not be in vain. Let me repeat that, if I can help somebody as I travel along then my living will not be in vain. That's cultural and spiritual mentor. Now, I wanna, ah, talk a little bit about the many mentors, uhm, that, ah, I been blessed to have in my life. And they've mentored me in very different ways. One of the things about the Janet Helms award that I loved is that it honors both mentoring and scholarship. Now how many of you knew that scholarship can mentor people at a distance. Oh, honey by the end of this you gonna have that clear in your head, all right. Uhm, one of the early mentors who scholarship really impacted me was Dr. Joseph White, how many of you know Joe White? If you don't, if you ever find him holding court in a hotel or here at the Roundtable go up and hug Dr. Joe White, all right. Uhm, he has mentored and bless so many of us. But I was mentored by Joe long before I ever meet him, all right. In 1960s, I think it was around 68, ah, I'm in college and I'm read an article by Joe White that change my life. It literally got me into the field of psychology. How many of you remember, ah, the article by Joe called Towards a Black Psychology, it was published in Ebony Magazine. Now, PS if you ever wanna reach the Black community forget this referee journals published in Ebony or Essence, all right. Because, ah, Joe got to me in that little, ah, bedroom at some little college and got to me a message about psychology that made me want to be want, all right. So having said that I wanna give you the back draft of my meeting with the famous Dr. Joe. Now it was first year here at TC and it was a spring of 1973. And I attended a conference at Hampton University, ah, historically black college on testing, all right. And, uhm, during that conference I met then great Dr. Joe White. So like all of you I went up to him, "Oh, Dr. White, ah, you know, hey, you are my hero, you are my role model. You are my elder." He said, "That's all okay, kid but loose the elder staff." Now I understand where he was coming from, all right. Uhm, but Joe welcome me, he included me and one of the things that I have always been so grateful for. The next morning I had my first ever presentation at a public gathering in the field. Joe sat for hours with me rehearse me, gave me pointers, uhm, that's mentoring folks. And some days when the burden gets heavy and, uhm, or the seas is so big and my boat is so small I think of Joe. Uhm, Joe has written more letters for A.J. and I and his lifetime in our careers than anybody else, all right. Uhm, ah, sometimes when I've got 15 or 20 request to write letters I think about Joe, all right. Uhm, he modeled mentoring. And again I want you to remember that Joe was one of the first people to mentor me through his scholarship. Uhm, I can't tell you how many times I've been blessed to have somebody come up to me and say, "You know, when I was, ah, in grad school in the middle of nowhere not another spec in the soul checker. And, uhm, I read your books and they lifted me up they got me through. that is mentoring through scholarship and to me that's very, uhm, very special. And I just I, I'm gonna miss somebody but, uhm, ah, charge it to my head and not my heart we were just joking about what happens with our memory at this stage in life. But I wanna start by acknowledging my association of Black family, ah, AB Psy(ph) family. Uhm, Thomas Parham stand up, Thomas. I listen to Thomas's, uhm, Thomas's, uhm, speech that he gave when he, ah, accepted the Janet Helms award it's about mountain top. And it is awesome A.J. knows I've got it under my pillow. It's one of though she keep for a long time very special message. Uhm, Mike Connor(ph) who just has been here for me, Joe, Joe White. Ah, for the younger generation who don't know I met A.J. at APA side take for what you want. Uhm, but, ah, I wanna acknowledge some of our AB Psy family who have has passed on but who really, ah, just gave us all so much, ah, Reginald Jones. Uhm, if you haven't found Reggie's books online go online he wrote some of the most powerful books in the field about Black psychology. John and Harriet McAdoo, all right. Uhm, ah, John and Harriet outside of being outstanding scholars on the Black family taught A.J. and I how to be a professional couple in this field. And for that we owe them a great deal and I will always be grateful for that. And of course the great Asa Hilliard who, ah, taught us all about the many sides of, ah, the contributions of Africa to this field. Uhm, and you know, with so many losses in recent years, uhm, one of the things I'd like to say to all of you I'll say it again before I stop today and that is honor your mentors while they're still on the planet. Give him a hug , show him some love, okay. Uhm, because were only here for a very short time. Uhm, I also, ah, I wanna honor my many peer mentors. You know, back in the day folks they weren't a whole lot of a folks ahead of us. So we lifted each other up. If you haven't figure it out now you don't have to get a doctorate to be a mentor, hello. Uhm, there's a mentor sitting right and stock less with you or being equally overwhelmed with the dissertation, all right. Ah, but I wanna call out some of mine, uhm, Monica McGoldrick, uhm, the other person in the family field whose bought multicultural issues to the family field. Uhm, Bev Greene, ah, one of the outstanding, ah, scholars on LGBT issues. Uhm, Derald Wing Sue who is all of you know is getting that, uhm, ah, award for social justice today he deserves it. Uhm, Brenna Bry who I'm mention earlier who has just been an amazing support to me at Rutgers. Uhm, Janet Helms for this award is named to is really a sister in the struggle. Uhm, Paulette Hines mention earlier another sister in struggle. Thomas, Thomas his name shows up on all the list folks. Uhm, Michelle Fine who many of you have heard here. Uhm, Sholanda Kelly again, Sholanda Kelly and Jim Comer at Yale, who, ah, for A.J. and i just has been an amazing mentor and supporter. Uhm, now I try to honor my mentors through my scholarship but, uhm, I really need to call out two people who I first read when I was here at Teachers College and then met they're part of our professional extended family. Bob Hill and Andrew Billingsley. Uhm, when I was here at Columbia at Teachers College and I went over to the library here I want you to know that s o much of the literature on African-American families and other families of color for that matter was a negative and figurative, all right. My dissertation share had the unenviable task of editing out of my dissertation. My comments about Daniel Patrick Moynihan who just disparage the Black family in his original treatise. She said to me Nancy you can't call him a racist every other sentence they wanna hear something else like, all right, what whatever. Uhm, but I found two books, uhm, that literally transformed my contribution to the field. i found two books that talked about the strength of our people. Uhm, some of you know Bob Hills book The Strengths of Black Families, it's an awesome book, it's still relevant. Uhm, and Andy Billingsley famous treatise Black families and White America. And they taught me about strength. They taught me about looking for strengths their in the sociology part of the field and I decided that I was bringing two psychology and the therapy part of the field and the counseling part of the field that commitment to talking about strengths. Back in the day I mean I know you guys have grown up with this stuff but back in the day it didn't exist you got to know what an honor it is to make a difference in that way. Uhm, I wanna speak a little bit about finding mentors. now I told you all that you don't have to have a doctorate, uhm, and you don't have to be famous, uhm, but I, I wanna talk about getting off and finding mentors I e-- not waiting for them to come to you. Can I hear an amen on that. Common guys this is important. When I was here at Columbia as I said, they were no people of color as faculty in Clinical or Counseling Psychology. And I had come here to learn how to work with African-American and other ethnic minority families, all right. I was so disappointed I was dejected, all right. And I reach out to my AB Psy family and they told me about a small agency right up the street in Harlem on a 125 street, all right. It was right next to just for context the Apollo Theater, okay. It's call Harlem Interfaith Counseling Service, how many of you all remember HECS, anybody? All right. Well I'm gonna lift them up for you. Fred and Doris Dennard taught me everything understand this everything I know about therapy and about working with people of color. They taught me that it was, okay, to think about talk about and look at culture and race in therapy. They told me that it was all right to talk about spirituality, all right. They introduced me to the cycles spiritual approach to treatment, all right. I still, ah, site them and reference them in my work. But I wanted to make sure you all knew where it all came from. And I wanna mention one last person, ah, last but not the least and that was my first therapist, ah, Dr. Vera Pastor(ph), uhm, thankfully she's still with us. Uhm, but Vera(ph) is an African-American woman who taught me a lot about boundaries in therapy. You know if you stick with a euro western view of what counseling is about. Then if you see your therapist up in here you can't go up and hug him. Get over it, all right. I'm serious folks. Uhm, Vera demonstrated back then grace under fire she sat right here on the front raw for a lot of my early presentations. She mentored me at huge. So now I wanna spend just a few minutes, uhm, before I completely run out of time. Uhm, talking specifically, uhm, about what I've learn from my mentors and honoring the cultural and spiritual legacy of mentoring in my own life and I hope in a lot of yours. And I'm hoping that it will empower particularly those in the next generation. Uhm, now these are not particularly in order, uhm, they are as as the spirit move me so I give them to you in that spirit. I have 10 of them, uhm, but there are many more this was these were the one that I felt would be the most important. Number one if you have been bless to receive mentoring from somebody give it extend the hand to the next generation, all right. Now here's the catch don't wait until you're famous. Don't wait until you have your doctorate. Don't wait until your 10th year. Don't wait until you published 900 publications start now. There is somebody out there who needs it from you, all right. I am so proud in the Rutgers Somerset Program every year to see our, ah, counselors, ah, offers services to young at risk middle schoolers to see our undergrads mentor and tutor those kids. And to see our graduates students mentor the undergrads folks that's our cultural legacy of mentoring that's what it's all about. Uhm, so give something back. And you know, the job of, ah, mentors is to help young people have hope. Ah, let me repeat that the job of a mentor is to have-- help young people to have hope. All right. Uhm, when the go and gets rough and the dissertation won't come and comes around the corner and your mamas calling you to help with three kids at-- hey, your mentors job is to give you hope. And I wanna remind you what my first mentors told me the hope is in the struggle folks and I wasn't meant to be easy. Now the second thing that I wanna talk about is don't be afraid to show your true selves to your mentis, all right. I know some of you are blown away you probably have not heard God and prayer mention this much in your entire careers but folks that's who I am and the students who know me who get to know me over the years know that to. Uhm, so don't hide your cultural strength, don't hide your spirituality and don't hide your passion from your mentis. Uhm, I must say though just an a side piece it just gives me such pleasure to honor God and to call out spirituality at Teachers College Columbia University. Now, uhm, some of you may not realize what that means but when I started here in 1972 our field was very anti spiritual, all right. Can I get an amen, it was. All right. It pathologized spirituality, all right. Now many of you have heard this but the story about I'm telling anyway so just buckle your seat belts. Uhm, when I was here at Columbia right up in the psychology clinic, ah, many of my clients were African-American, all right. Uhm, when that's what happens when you set up a clinic in the middle of Harlem. And so, uhm, I had an amazing, uhm, grandmother that I was working with and you know, I've written a lot about grandmas that is not an accident folk they are huge in our culture and in many of yours. But I had this grandma and she had lost her daughter her daughter had died suddenly. And she had come out of retirement to raise six grandchildren, all right. And i remember I said to her how do you do it. And she said, "Child I pray to the Lord." all right. And I remember you know, we used to have to record our sessions on those little tape recorders. And my supervisor listen to the tape and she said, "Oh, oh, religiosity." That's like what is her problem, all right. And a couple of weeks alter I ask her what where does your strength come from? And she said, I can do all things to Christ to strengthens me. You should have seen the field to have my supervised I have with that one. All right. But some years later, uhm, some of you know the story I, ah, over my career have often run therapeutic support groups for African-American and other women of color. And I had, ah, had a group and a young woman she's only about 28 years old share with the group that she had, had four abortions all right, and then she burst into tears. All right. Now she was a political activist, she, uhm, believe in the woman's right to choose. She had demonstrated down at the supreme court for all, ah, of the laws that allowed women that choice. But in her heart of heart she blamed herself. She felt guilty and she couldn't forgive herself. And as I'm sitting this group thinking oh, my what do I do now? One member of the group ask everybody to join hands I went with it, she said I wanna pray I wanna say a prayer for this sister. And she said, "Dear God please help this sister to know that you are a forgiving God and that she has to forgive herself and move on." There was not a dry eye in the room including mine and I must honestly confess that a couple hours later I did wonder what my supervisors at Teachers College would have said about that one. All right. Uhm, but those pieces, ah, are a part of me they are part of those of you who were going to work with African-American women not for all of us but for many of us it's a deep in grain part of our society. So the third issue mentor recognized that you mentor others through your scholarship those you may never meet on the planet. When I think back to Joe White or Bob Hill or Andy Billingsley they made a difference in my life and career and even if I had never meet them I've been blessed to meet them but even if I had never meet them they mentored me. Number four many of you know, uhm, Marie said it earlier, uhm, there are some saying that my mentors gave me that I have passed on to my mentis and so number four is there are no accidents all things happen for reason. There are no accidents all of you who are up in here today you're here for a reason. All right. And I know that this speech was meant to touch somebody up in here I don't know who but I know as I prepared that somebody needs some hope. And somebody needs an uplift so this is for you. Uhm, so there are no accidents. Number five don't be isolated, ah, if you haven't got it by now from my story develop your own professional extended family and keep them close at hand. Refuel with them regularly, you know, uhm, Marie and I have joke about how many times A.J. and I and Thomas come to the Roundtable when we're not presenting Melba(ph) we come to the man in the table when we're not presenting just to have our refueling and our hug and our inspiration. Number six self-care take care of yourselves you can't help anybody if you burned out. Some of you know I've just finish another book, it's called Therapy in the Real World. I wanted to subtitle it everything, ah, you didn't learn in graduate school but they wouldn't let me. But anyway this are the things in that chapter on self-care I talked about spiritual self-care, emotional self care, physical self-care because all of you who do this clinical or counseling are gonna come up against folk who been through trauma. It might be the trauma of abuse. It might be the trauma of poverty. It might be the trauma of racism or sexes a more homophobia those are traumas. And unless you are aware of self-care you can suffer from compassion fatigue, all right. You can burn out, all right. And so you really need to hold on to those things that lift you up spirituality, emotionally and mentally. And for us the Roundtable is one of the, uhm, I really, uhm, A.J. and I go to AB Psy for the same reason we go to the divisions 45 and 17 of APA. APA is a huge conference with 15000 people on a given year. But we can always find our professional extended family in most places. Uhm, and it doesn't have to be your discipline you know, I wanna give a shout out to my brothers and sisters in the association of Black social workers. They have lifted up for years folks. Uhm, number seven now this is really important be get ready for this. You are somebody that's what Jesse Jackson says. You are worthy all right, you are worthy whether you ever get a doctorate. You are worthy whether you never get good GRE scores, you amen, you are worthy whether you never published in an article. You are worthy if you get rejected by an article. You are worthy no matter what because you're you. That's what my family taught me. And you have something to offer just don't forget that in the moments. Believe in yourselves. How many of you are forgive are familiar with the book by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale it's called The Power of Positive Thinking. If you have never read it put it down folks, the power so positive thinking. Now some of you know the story, uhm, Monica Magoldrick recommended to my publisher that he invite me to do a book on Black families. And I said to him, "I'll think about it and I'll get back to you." And I was ruminated you know, can I do this, uhm, is it possible and A.J. I'll you got love verb he took me aside he said, "Are you out of your cockpit in your head do it." All right. Believe in yourself but some of you know those moments are down come up for all of us. If you thought you've got to be in your 60s and it's gone just keep on live in folks it sticks around. Uhm, but I can remember when I was writing my first book and every morning I would travel from Brooklyn to Newark to the community mental health center and I would take the path train any of you all know the path train, all right, goes to New Jersey but whatever. Uhm, and I used to get the same conductor every morning on the path train. And every morning I would read the chapter in the power positive thinking called believe in yourself, all right. And 1 day this conductor I had spoken to him everyday for a long time he said to me is an older African-American gentlemen he said, "Miss I don't mean no harm but did you finish that book yet?" All right. Uhm, but I wanna tell you an important secret about publishing people, uhm, tell me all the time well how if you published so much you know. How do you, ah, how do you do it? Ah, how do you make it happen? And I think back to that time, uhm, my mother taught me something, uhm, I wanna share it with you those of you who know me or who have work on a dissertation with em know this. Uhm, but I write every time I sit down to write. I write an affirmation I write a spiritual affirmation. All right. Now that's may shock some of you but they are some of you up in here whose mothers prayed for you and you know in your heart of heart you know this. I write in big red letters and put it next to my computer thank you dear God this book is finish and its wonderful. You can folks to do it for dissertation, do it for those papers that you can't forget yourself to put out. This is huge I promise I come up here and tell the truth up in here today, all right. Now I told you what you are. I wanna tell you what you're not because my mentor is also help me know this. Had a take a deep breath before this, you are not your day job repeat after me you are not your day job. You're bigger than that. You are not your doctorate you're bigger than that. You are not your publications you're bigger than that. You are not you're awards as wonderful as this Janet Helms award is you are not you're awards. It's what it-- what's inside that counts and you need to give that back to the next generation. Now, uhm, cherish number eight. Cherish all of the mentors that you need along the way. Now I say that because they are still some people in spite of all this they think they have to have doctorates. My mother believed as I told you earlier that mentors are angels that God puts in your path, all right, accept them, all right. Mentors can be in your life forever or for season. Mentors can be the janitor here at TC that use to rude as on. Those can be your mentors. In fact, uhm, how many of you know the story of the man and the flood. Oh, common somebody old folks are saying, oh, oh, she's get right a free job in here, all right. There was a flood and, uhm, man was in the flood and it flooded his first floor, all right. And they sent a boat and they said, "Common this the boat, uhm, to get people out of here." And he said, "I don't need the boat I'm praying to the Lord." They said, "Okay, bye." Water came got up to the second floor. Not a boat came, all right, second boat came and he said, "I, I don't need the boat God's gonna rescue me." You see where this is going. Well his all house was submerge under water and it was up on the roof and they sent a helicopter, all right. And he said, "No, I don't need this helicopter God will save me." Well of course he died and he went to heaven and he said to God, "Why did you forsake me." And God said, "Fool I sent you two boats and a helicopter what more did you want." So look to the left of you and look to the right of you. And recognized some of the mentors in the skies the angels that are put in your path. Many of you are healer, uhm, when I listen to Tom's wonderful Thomas Parham's wonderful, uhm, ah, lecture on a mountain top. One of the things that he talk about was healers seeing the potential in other people. Well mentors that's your gift. It's seeing the potential in your students and colleagues when they can't see it for themselves. Uhm, and last, uhm, but not the least, ah, number ten. Have the courage to make a difference in this world. Make your scholarship count for something. Make your degrees count for something and give something back to the next generation. And I would just like to end as I began earlier I am so proud to receive this Janet Helms award but I wanna leave you with the words of that old hymn, uhm, a paraphrase and a little, uhm, that my mother-in-law and Martin Luther King Jr. was so fun of if you can help somebody as you travel along then you're living will not be in vain. That is the cultural and spiritual legacy of mentoring and the best way to empower the next generation. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
