GAZDA ON GROUPS GROUP COUNSELING 

00:00:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Hello! Welcome to group counseling. My name is George Gazda. I hope this video presentation is helpful in increasing your understanding of the group counseling process, especially from a developmental prospective. Presentation will be organized into two major sections. First, I will outline the theory and rationale of developmental group counseling. Second, I will describe social or life skills training. Throughout both major sections of the presentation, I'll not only discuss and describe these ideas, but you'll have an opportunity to observe some of the key ideas to the actual group interaction. In some cases, the group interaction will be like that found in a typical classroom discussion between instructor and students. In other instances, you will see a simulated counseling group in action with the help of some of my doctoral students in Counseling Psychology. Thus, we often create on individual issues or concerns for demonstration purposes. Finally, this short video presentation cannot comprehensively cover the topic of developmental group counseling. Therefore, I refer you to my book on this subject, "Group Counseling: A Developmental Approach" for additional information. 

00:01:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA  But what exactly is group counseling? My colleagues and I have arrived at this definition of group counseling. Group counseling is a dynamic, interpersonal process of focusing on conscious thought and behavior, and involving the therapy functions of permissiveness, orientation to reality, catharsis, mutual trust, caring, understanding, acceptance, and support. The therapy functions are created and nurtured in a small group through the sharing of personal concerns with one's peers and the counselor or counselors. The group counselees may utilize the group interaction to increase understanding and acceptance of values and goals, and to learn and/or unlearn certain attitudes and behaviors. Some key ideas offered by Bramarin(ph) Shostrum(ph) serve to distinguish group counseling from group psychotherapy. For example, group counseling can be described by the following adjectives: Educational, supportive, situational, problem-solving, conscious awareness, emphasis on normals, and short-term. Group psychotherapy, however, is more characterized by adjectives such as reconstructive, depth analysis, analytical, focus on the unconscious focus on neurotics or other severe emotional difficulties, and long-term induration. As this diagram shows, there is actual overlap among the various kinds of group experiences. Group Counseling and Life Skills, the topic for this presentation, typically dominates the preventive end of the continuum but also occurs along the co, along the continuum including remedial groups. 

00:03:45
GEORGE M. GAZDA Let's first look at a diagram which illustrates how areas of knowledge and coping skills came about. On this diagram, you will notice that there are seven areas; psychosocial, moral, affective, ego, cognitive, occasional and physical-sexual. Those se, seven areas represent me, what we know about the complete and comprehensive components of a person as they develop along life's pathways. What I've tried to do then is to pull from each of these seven areas, the coping skills necessary to function effectively in, in that area and then combine them into a total model. So in developmental group counseling, we are looking at the whole person across the seven areas of human development from birth until death, across the life span. 

00:04:40
GROUP COUNSELING STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT: 

00:04:40
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Developmental group counseling also considers the phenomena of groups developing through stages across time. I include four stages of group development. There are differing opinions, however, on the number of stages. The exploratory stage or getting acquainted stage includes introductions of group members and establishing ground rules and group norms. Stage two is a transition period where the counselor encourages higher levels of self disclosure by counselees. Some counselees will begin more personal self disclosure while others will remain somewhat superficial. In the action or work stage, counselees work on goals set earlier. The last or fourth stage determination is important in helping counselees tie up loose ends. Here, counselees usually review self disclosure and share good feelings about the group. Let's take a look at a group in action. 

00:05:45
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Since this is our first session, why don't we begin by just briefly introducing yourself and you can say as much or as little about yourself as you want at this point. 

00:05:55
LATRELLE  I'll go first. I'm Latrelle(ph) and I'm a single doctoral student in Counseling Psychology. 

00:06:05
GEORGE GAZDA Okay. 

00:06:05
ALLEN My name is Allen and I m also single and I'm a doctoral student in Counseling Psych. 

00:06:10
SHIRLEY  I'm Shirley and I'm a first year doctoral student in Zoology. 

00:06:15
ASTRID I'm Astrid and this is my first year in Counseling Psych. 

00:06:20
DEBBIE I'm Debbie and I'm a second year doctoral student, and I'm recently married. 

00:06:25
BILL I'm Bill. I'm a beginning graduate student in Immunology. I've been working for a while and just getting back into school. 

00:06:35
CINDY I'm Cindy and I'm a second year student in Counseling Psychology and I'm married. 

00:06:40
KEVIN I'm Kevin. I'm married. I've got two kids and I'm in the doctoral program and I have to drive four and a half hours one way just to get here. 

00:06:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA  So it's pretty rough on you Kevin and the family, I guess commuting. Ah, let's, let's take a moment now and review the ground rules that we went over in our individual interviews just to make sure that as a group, we understand what we they are and what we have agreed to. Ah first of all, remember one of the ground rules was that we would ah, ah, set our, set some goals for ourselves before we came to the group and then of course, while we're in the group too. Continue to work on those goals and we'd like to get started on, on the ah, on that right away. And then another ground rule was that we would come to the group regularly and on time, be on time. That we would ah, not make decisions about what the group does ah, in terms of changing our meeting time or extending out meetings ah, without a consensus. Ah, we don't vote ah, we don't vote in this group. Ah, it's not like a typical group where you take a vote. We have to agree to something or not do it all. It's got, It's got to be that, that kind of a, an action. 

00:08:05
GEORGE M. GAZDA Then we talked about why you're here, that you would ah, listen to each other and ah, when you're not talking, and respect other people when they're talking, and try to ah, communicate your understanding in what they're trying to say, and that's, that's an important uhm, ah, aspect of the ground rule. Ah, and a, another ground rule is that we ah, that we ah, do not break the confidences of the group. That is ah, that the information that you share in here is confidential among the members of this group and with me. And that short of ah, an illegal action ah, proposed by you that is a serious harm to someone else or to yourself, we would not break, I would not break those confidences and I wouldn't expect you to have to break them either. Ah, so those are some of the basic ah, ground rules for this group. Another one is that ah, the, that there, as I said to you in the beginning ah, interview that there may be occasion where someone doesn't seem to be benefiting from the group. And in that case, that person and I would need to have a conference, an individual conference, and it may be better for that person to be dropped from the group rather than continue. And it would be my ah, responsibility then to find ah, another group for you or to continue on an individual basis with you. Ah, I think we have covered most of the ah, basic ah, ground rules. Do any of you uhm, have any question or problem with those? 

00:09:50
CINDY Uhm, you spoke about confidentiality. Can I talk about things that, that might come up in the group with my spouse? Is, is that a problem? 

00:10:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA Not, not a only, only things that you can talk with your spouse about that comes up in the group are the things that you initiate. 

00:10:05
CINDY  Okay. 

00:10:10
GEORGE M. GAZDA Any question about that? Do you all understand that? You're not to talk about, let's say Allen brings up or Latrellee or Kevin or Bill. 

00:10:20
CINDY Just lail(ph). 

00:10:20
GEORGE M. GAZDA Right. Uh hmm. Of course we discussed the fees for the group consensus is a, is not a fee-paying group. We don't have an issue with that ah, but that would be another topic. And then, remember in the, in, in initialization, I asked you if there was anybody that you would not want to be in the group with. That's another ground rule but we've already covered that because we've taken care of that. And I don't believe you'd find any body in here that anybody would not want to be in a group with. And that's just to present pro, ah, to prevent problems later on. Okay. If there are, aren't any additional questions, if, if you have issues with these ground rules later on, feel free to bring them up, but we'll just assume then that ah, that you all agreed to. Okay. The next thing I'd like for us to do in this session is then to open it up to some of the issues that you bring to, to this group. Ah, what are some of that concerns that you have that you wanna work on? What are some of your goals to accomplish here? Who would like to begin with that? 

00:11:35
LATRELLEE I'd like to start.(crosstalk) 

00:11:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA You don't have to raise your hand just. Begin with that? 

00:11:35
LATRELLEE I'd like to start.(crosstalk) 

00:11:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA You don't have to raise your hand. Just feel free to start. 

00:11:40
LATRELLEE Uhm, I'd like to start. One of the things that I'd like to work on is feeling more comfortable in social settings and get-togethers. I don't found that, I have that right now. And uhm, I really would like to feel more comfortable and integrate it within the program, within the community, in all aspects of my life. I'm not trying that right now. 

00:12:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA So, you're feeling kinda alienated from your, the in-group, and, and would like to get closer. All right. Okay. 

00:12:05
ALLEN  Uhm, I'd like to maybe try to work on my time management skills a little bit. I, It just seems like I have more to do than I have time and I have trouble telling people "No". I know that about statistics and everybody always comes to me with their statistical questions and I, they're so interesting that I just can't say no but yet I end up causing problems for myself because I take on more than I can do. 

00:12:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA So, ah, in your case Allen, you, you just have to ah, find a way to comfortably say no to people who are kinda leaning on you for a consultation. 

00:12:45
ALLEN  Right. I have trouble with that. 

00:12:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA I wonder if any of the others that you have is similar to what Latrellee or Allen are bringing up ah, some, these are relatively common issues I think for graduate students. 

00:13:00
KEVIN Well, I think mine is sort of similar to theirs but I don't know. I think it's important to kinda state up front that I'm really only this group because my supervisor recommended that I participate in but I'm, I'm not so sure that ah, ah, my concerns about me being so far away from home when I'm up here, that everybody else can really tie into but she said that I might be able to get something about that ah, in terms of helping to deal with it. In terms of participating in the group so that's why I'm here. 

00:13:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA So you're not, you're not really sure ah, Kevin, that ah, the separation from your family is, is much of an issue as your, ah, as your adviser seems to think it is and so this is some thing that you're doing right now somewhat to please her. 

00:13:50
KEVIN Yeah. I guess, sort of. 

00:13:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Well, feel free of course. No one is required to be in this group so if you feel uncomfortable at some point in being here, then you and I may need to talk about it and you wouldn't have to continue but maybe as a kind of rule of thumb, I've found that the people give a group three or four sessions, then they can decide on their own whether it's been official to them or not, regardless of how they entered. Anybody else want to say anything about ah. 

00:14:25
ASTRID I'd like to able to relate to people in the group setting better. That's been a concern of mine so I hope I would be able to use this group for that. 

00:14:30
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Uh hmm, okay. So yours is not unlike Latrellee's situation's sounds like. Yeah. Anybody else? 

00:14:40
BILL  Some of what ah, Kevin said earlier about uhm, having to commute, I do that myself. I'm only have a two-hour drive but mostly I live in two different places and two kids, and so that's why I'm here is try and figure out how to make all that work. Uhm, coming back into school, I'm just not sure how to I'm gonna fit it in and spend half the week here and half the week at home. 

00:15:05
GEORGE M. GAZDA So for you Bill, you see some similarity between ah, what Kevin is facing and what you're facing in terms of, and I guess to some degree what Allen's saying that time demands. These are time demands too, but yours is a little bit different in that you have a separation issue here with family. 

00:15:20
KEVIN Uh hmm. Uh-huh. 

00:15:20
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. This is our fourth session. Ah, who'd like to begin today? 

00:15:25
SHIRLEY  I have an issue I'd like to bring up, and that is when I get back to Atlanta after being here all week a week, I'm, I'm tired or, or I'm busy and my boyfriend George doesn't seem to understand that because he would like to go hiking or dancing and he's ready for me to do something with him. And I just wanna be left alone to study or I just want to, to rest. And so, it's become an issue between us. It's really bothering me a lot. 

00:15:55
CINDY  You know Shirley, when I was in my Masters program and uhm, I had a long commute, even a little bit longer than you have to Atlanta right now and I had the same kind to say(ph), same sorts of things happen with my family. I got into some real problems trying to balance everything with the family and my... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
CINDY ...and my spouse so, yeah, I, I could understand that that would be an issue for you. It was for me then. 

00:16:20
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. I really don't know what to do with that. I'm afraid it's gonna harm our relationship if I don't compromise and go out more than I'm really comfortable doing. 

00:16:30
ALLEN I can agree with that because that because it seems like I end up taking on so much work that I don't have time for myself and even when I do, (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
ALLEN wanna do something with someone else, I just, you know, have to tell them no...(crosstalk) 

00:16:45
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
ALLEN And it's just so frustrating because I take on more than I can do. 

00:16:50
SHIRLEY I understand. Yeah. It's, It's hard when you're the one in school. The other person doesn't understand how much work you have.(crosstalk) 

00:16:55
ALLEN Oh, exactly. Ah, this, this is just very troublesome.(crosstalk) 

00:17:00
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
CINDY That used to happen to me all the time too. And it was really, it really became a big issue just like you my spouse never understood.(crosstalk) 

00:17:10
SHIRLEY Uh-huh. 

00:17:10
CINDY Uhm, you know, that all the pressures that I was under. So, yeah.(crosstalk) 

00:17:15
SHIRLEY Right. Right. 

00:17:15
[sil.] 

00:17:15
GEORGE M. GAZDA  It sounds like that, that several of you are still struggling then with this issue of, of separation and ah, and, and time ah, that you have for each other or for family. And ah, I'm not sure that, that the, I hear that anybody's moving towards any kind of a, a resolution of this issue that it sounds like it's still pretty alive and well so to speak. Ah, things aren't, aren't improving. 

00:17:50
SHIRLEY  But, it, it helps to hear that other people have the problem though. Yeah. 

00:18:00
CINDY Well that's really not so much of an issue for me now. It was, it was several years ago when I was doing my Master's program. 

00:18:05
GEORGE M. GAZDA So something happened ah, Cynth, Cynthia(ph), for you to, to resolve that, and maybe the passage of time; I'm not sure what, but perhaps at some point, you might be able to share some of the issues that you ah, worked out with your family ah, with these other group members, ah, perhaps it would be helpful to them. Do you have any, do you have any uhm, ideas that might be generalizable to other people? 

00:18:35
CINDY I think I'll have to give that a little bit of thought. 

00:18:40
GEORGE M. GAZDA All right. All right. I get the feeling, ah, Keith, ah, Kevin that you uhm, the, this issue isn't ah, ah, of much concern to you right now that there, there are other things on your mind today. 

00:18:55
KEVIN  Yeah. 

00:19:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA I, I hope you feel free to share them at any point if you like, ah, don't feel like you need to, but ah, if, if you'd like to, feel free to do that. 

00:19:10
KEVIN (inaudible ) I just don't think they're gonna understand what's going on with me. 

00:19:15
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Kinds of issues you have are so different in your mind that, that they wouldn't be able to ah, identify with them? 

00:19:25
KEVIN  Yeah. To me there's a big difference an hour you say that saying. Two hours, I mean I'm 40. 

00:19:35
SHIRLEY  But the issue is the same though, it's, it's separated from your family, time management. So why don't you try us? 

00:19:45
  Yeah, I agree with that. I mean we, you just have to, give us a chance. (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
 (inaudible ) 

00:19:57
GEORGE M. GAZDA I don't know, is that related? Remember when we started, I said, you know, you might take three or four sessions and see how, how it goes and then decide whether you want to stay in the group. It is, is that part of the issue that we're dealing with? I don't know. 

00:20:10
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Are you still kind of on, on the fence Kevin? I'm not sure whether you wanna be in the group.(crosstalk) 

00:20:20
KEVIN Yeah. I guess I am kind of on the fence. I, I just don't think everybody else really understands what I'm going through. I think it's a lot different. Ah, I mean, just time wise, the way my schedule is set, I just don't have time for hardly anything, ah, for my family and then I'm up here four days a week. It just gets pretty lonely sometimes. 

00:20:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA I sense, Kevin, you're saying something else to that neither does your family seem to understand the pressure on you when you're home, nor do your colleagues here or your peers here understand ah, what you're up against, that you don't, you can't satisfy either group. Is that's...(crosstalk) 

00:21:10
KEVIN You know, I, I think I get disappointed when I'm home, but I'm not there that much. 

00:21:15
GEORGE M. GAZDA Uh-huh, uh hmm. 

00:21:15
LATRELLEE  I think I wanna see Kevin when you come at far and not fitting in. It's really hard for me sometimes to feel comfortable and I can see that that may be a problem for you too if you felt like you don't get that support. You cannot be supportive if you feel alone and isolated. 

00:21:35
ALLEN  This is the first time really I've known about it. I mean, he, he, he is in some of my classes, Kevin. He has been, and he seems like a really bright guy and I think we might have something in common but I just don't hear anything, it's I really didn't know that all this was going on. Ah, I mean, I spend hours and hours and hours in front of a computer. I can spend five hours not doing anything. That, as for me a, it really helps me out, and ah, so I, I can, I, I know what that is but I mean I just don't hear it from you. I mean, this is the first time I knew of it. 

00:22:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:15
KEVIN Oh, maybe I just expected you to, I mean, most people know how, how far it is for me to drive home. Of the shoot, of the four days that I'm up here, ah, two of them, half that day is spent on the road. And. 

00:22:30
SHIRLEY  It sounds really tiring. 

00:22:35
KEVIN Yeah. It is. 

00:22:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA So it's really in addition to being a sep, separated from your family, ah, it's, it's the stress of trying to cram things into a shortened week. 

00:22:45
KEVIN Yeah. It's, I mean, simply because the driving, I've got one less day than everybody else does. 

00:22:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
KEVIN  And, I don't know, I didn't think anybody ever really appreciated that. 

00:22:55
DEBBIE  I can understand what you're saying too. Ah, it takes me, on, on the road everyday for, for like two and a half hours. So, I come to school five days a week, so that takes away home days, times two to be studying and balancing a marriage and friends and family, and I know it's really tough too. I feel really separated from my husband to do that every day. It's kind of hard to balance it. 

00:23:20
KEVIN  Yeah. 

00:23:25
GEORGE M. GAZDA Just have so many hours in a day and you can't spread them out enough to satisfy everybody including your own needs to do your work. 

00:23:30
BILL  I kind of like, I don't know Kevin. I just, uhm, it means to me that you feel like. I just felt like if you don't know anymore talking at home than you do in here. How is anybody gonna know? 

00:23:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA Well perhaps, ah, Kevin hasn't felt safe enough yet to talk it here. I'm not sure. I'm kind of reading into this, but, ah, and then too, not knowing whether he is gonna continue with the group might have been an issue. Maybe that was more of a problem for you, then ah, I thought it might help you make a decision, but maybe that just puts you into a quandary than trying to decide whether you are gonna stay in a group beyond four sessions or not. So ah.(crosstalk) 

00:24:20
KEVIN I don't know. One minute it, it, I start to feel kind of good, 'coz it sounds like you gotta sort to understand ah, and in another minute I, I don't know, I wanna get angry and say, "No, you don't understand. It's not the same." I don't know. 

00:24:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. Who would like to begin today? kay. Who would like to begin today? 

00:24:45
SHIRLEY  I like that. I'm not reporting to the group how things are, are doing between George and myself. Well I talked to him about what I talked to about in groups that I felt like I had to thought of accommodate him on a weekend. And to my surprise, he said he didn't wanna have to go out all that time, but he thought he was trying to help me out, 'coz I was so, I'm busy and, and he was glad to stay home more. And so just talking about us made a big difference for me. So thank you all for encouraging me to talk to him. Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
KEVIN  You know, I think early on, when, Allen, you made the comment, she'd get it if you talk a little at home as you do around here. How is anybody gonna know? And that really struck a cord with me, and ah, I guess a week or so...(crosstalk) 

00:25:35
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
KEVIN ...that we talked about a little bit more and since that time I've tried to kind of go out of the way and take a couple more risks and say, "Hey, I'm up here alone and sometimes I don't like it." And ah, one of the, remember when you invited me to come over and have dinner with...(crosstalk) 

00:25:50
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
KEVIN ...you and Bill, I don't think you would've done that before. I had to kind of say, "You know I'm so tired of being cooped up in that little bitty trailer."(crosstalk) 

00:25:55
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
KEVIN And it's just been nice having people reach out to me and ah, I think it all just started from that common key(ph) tab(ph) and you just don't let people know and you stay so close to. 

00:26:05
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
KEVIN  Oh good!. Just, it feels really good to have people say, "Hey, I understand what it's like." You know, making that run. And you can take them out. In the long run, your, your 10 hours' a heck of a lot more than my ache(ph).(crosstalk) 

00:26:15
GEORGE M. GAZDA  It sounds like several of you are beginning to ah, get some issues resolved for yourself. At least things are more comfortable than they have been. 

00:26:30
BILL Things have gotten a lot better for me, I've ah, kind of lowered my expectations to myself. There wasn't enough time and uhm, plus the, the kids are getting more used to me being away during the week... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
 That's right.(crosstalk) 

00:26:45
BILL ...ah, and that was good.(crosstalk) 

00:26:45
GEORGE M. GAZDA Yeah. That's good. Just gettin' used to it. 

00:26:45
BILL Yeah. This time alone, they know I'm coming back; I guess, I don't know. uhm, that was ah, a worry...(crosstalk) 

00:26:50
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
BILL  in the beginning and that, so that's different now. And I've got, gotten used to the routine a little bit better, still not get enough sleep and. 

00:27:00
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
LATRELLEE  Well, (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
ALLEN Well. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
LATRELLEE I'm sorry. Go ahead. 

00:27:05
ALLEN  Uhm, I think things have gotten a little bit better for me. Uhm, I still have a lot to do, but as it turns out I'm able to say no more. A really interesting study came across the desk the other day and I just said I couldn't work on it. The only work I did was for our study group in statistics. I only volunteered to do that. So I have a lot to do that is getting better. 

00:27:25
KEVIN  Well I've got some statistics on that. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
ALLEN Well I think, I like you Kevin but I don't think I can. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
GEORGE M. GUZMAN  He really just wanted to be with you. 

00:27:40
KEVIN How about pizza instead? 

00:27:40
ALLEN  I'll think about it. 

00:27:45
LATRELLEE Well for me, I, I know that I, I'm so much more comfortable in settings. I tried to figure out why it was important to me in the first place, and I realized that really I wanted to have more student involvement, interaction, so I went to the university union on campus and I got involved in some really specific areas. Uhm, I got involved in study groups so I could feel more comfortable in professional setting while I'm in college and at the doctoral level, and it's been wonderful. I've just had so much do. Now I may have to balance everything, but I do feel so much better in, in getting involved in using what are important as the basis for everything. 

00:28:20
GEORGE M. GAZDA I've been talking about terminating the group in, in a couple of weeks or the last couple of weeks now. And so, we've got a couple of more sessions. Uhm, if there's anyone with any unfinished business, ah, I would assume that now would be the time to take care of it. Ah, so who would like to begin today? 

00:28:40
KEVIN  I guess, I guess it's not so much a new business or unfinished business, but I remember the first meeting or two, each I remember, I didn't wanna be here. And it was only because my supervisor said I was supposed to be here. And now, I don't wanna leave. I mean you guys have all been so great and so good. I start thinking about, what did you say? Two more, three more?(crosstalk) 

00:29:10
SHIRLEY Three weeks. 

00:29:10
KEVIN I don't think I wanna leave the support. That's pretty scary for me. 

00:29:15
DEBBIE I was thinking about the same thing Kevin. I was kind of wondering if, if there was a way that we could, maybe meet down the road, you know, few month's down the road or so, and you know, just so we can keep up with each other. And I've really...(crosstalk) 

00:29:30
 (inaudible ) 

00:29:32
DEBBIE ...gotten a lot from being here too and I kind of hate to loose, you know, this, this nice atmosphere; well supported. 

00:29:35
SHIRLEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
ASTRID You know, that would be really nice. And I'll have to say something also is that, I think Kevin is that it was really good that you took risks. I, that was really good for me. I really appreciate you taking risk. This way, I can really participate in group better. 

00:29:50
KEVIN Uh hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:29:50
ASTRID I feel much better this way. Be nice if we can meet again and do... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
DEBBIE I'll be happy to, you know, become the contact person and get in touch with everybody if you are interested. 

00:30:00
SHIRLEY I'll be glad to help you cause I'm, I'm feeling really sad about the group ending. 

00:30:05
DEBBIE Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
SHIRLEY I really don't want the group to end. 

00:30:05
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Well, your keep kind of feelings here once is one of a positive feeling that things are going much better for you all and that ah, you've appreciated each other in the group and another one that ah, there's gonna be breaking up in a few weeks and that you kind of ah, hate to see it ah, hate to see it end. 

00:30:30
BILL  Yeah, I finally got, you know, this was real hard; first, trying to fit this into my schedule and I finally gotten used to setting this time slot aside, so now, I'm gonna mess up my routine. 

00:30:45
GEORGE M. GAZDA  What I'd like you to say, Bill, it's been worth the effort. 

00:30:50
BILL Yeah. 

00:30:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA  The simulations of the ah, group members began with the first counseling session and illustrate how I frequently begin my sessions with introductions, ah, followed by the individuals ah, reviewing the ground rules with me, and then ah, usually concluding with a presentation of the goals that they have set for themselves or the problem areas that they are gonna work on in the group. And ah, we saw those things happening in this ah, first ah, session. I'd like to just reiterate what the ground rules were that we agreed on. 

00:31:35
GROUP GROUND RULES: 

00:31:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA First, that ah, they would set goals to work on in the group. That they would be honest and concrete in discussing their concerns. They would listen to others while they were speaking. That they would maintain the confidentiality of everything said in the group. That they would be on time and attend regularly. And they would permit me to remove them from the group if the group was not meeting their needs. That they allow for group consensus in decision-making. And that we would, in the beginning, select out non-compatible group members. And that they would understand that concurrent individual counseling would be possible but that what was discussed in that would eventually be brought back into the group at their own ah, convenience. And then we had an agreement on what the fee would be for the session. 

00:32:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA  In the ah, second stage or the transition stage, you'll notice that in the group, the group members had began ah, to talk about ah, their problems in more depth and be more specific about them. Others still uhm, retained a rather historical approach to presenting their problems were somewhat more superficial. And then too, we had the occurrence of a, a person who is ah, withdrawing from the group. And I made an effort to bring him back into the group and tried to ah, get others involved with him so that he would feel ah, more a party to the group. This was followed by the ah, the work or action stage in which the members, several members discussed how the group had been helpful to them, what changes they had made, and ah, that they had been, been making a pretty good progress along the path that they had ah, or goals that they had set for themselves. And then finally in the termination stage, you'll note that the group members began to comment about, personally how ah, how the group helped them and how they would miss the group ah, when it ended, and they even made ah, began to make plans to have a reunion of the group members at a later date. These are typical kinds of, of things that happened through the four stages of my, well, of my Developmental Counseling Groups. 

00:34:10
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Let, let's go to the classroom, as my class and I review some other basic issues important to Developmental Group Counseling. 

00:34:25
ASTRID What need to be considered in selecting members for the group? 

00:34:30
GEORGE M. GAZDA Selection in group composition are keys to effective groups. I've found that if I select the right mix for a given group, the basic ingredients are already present for a productive group. In general, the concept of role balancing is, is adjusted as a rule of thumb to follow. And there are number of variables that go into these role balancing issue such as the age of the group members, the gender, and the race. For example, you would not want to have people in a children's group, say the ages 5 to 9 with more than a couple years' spread, nor would you want to have that for a pre-adolescent or an adolescent group. Once you get into the adult group, you could go well beyond a few years. In fact, 20, 30, 40 years is not an issue sometimes with adult groups. Then in terms of gender, the only time I really have a problem with gender is when ah, we're working with pre-adolescent groups, and that's when I use the same gender group, ah, ah, groups. For example, all males and all females in those treatment groups. 

00:35:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Ah, Gender balancing in terms of numbers is another issue. You should try to balance the groups with ah, a similar number of males and females. When it comes to ah, say the issue of race, again, you wanna have a balance in the group if possible. You don't want to have any racial group in a significant minority if at all possible. I found that that tends to prevent them, for some reason or other, getting involved. They feel ah, like minorities in the group and they tend not to fight for their, for their ah, equal time, so to speak. 

00:36:15
GEORGE M. GAZDA So those are just, and then of course, you also look at issues like ethnic issues and ah, even things like ability levels; you don't wanna have wide ranges. And of course, the same way with ah, diagnostic categories; you would not mix certain groups with certain other kinds of individuals. In other words, you wouldn't put a very fragile person in with a group of very aggressive people, and that kind of general ah, I will say more about that a little bit later, but those are just some of the issues that you, that I take into consideration in terms of role balancing. Any other questions? 

00:36:55
DEBBIE Uhm, in general, who should not be in a group? 

00:36:55
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Well, uhm, you, you, for my groups, I prefer not to have, let's say, close siblings in the same group, ah, ah, close friends and relatives. Uhm, and then there are other ah, categories like people with accelerated sexual drives ah, especially with adolescent ah, and ah, and children's groups. Certainly we try to keep sociopaths out of groups with ah, with people who don't have that classification. We wouldn't put a very aggressive individual in, as I said earlier with ah, with a ah, more passive ah, individuals. And ah, especially in a group, you wouldn't want a person coming into a group who's in a crisis or who's experienced just a recent trauma, because those individuals for example, would have to take ah, most of the groups time to deal with their crisis and the group would eventually realize that they couldn't help them that much immediately and ah, and they would become ah, disenchanted with that member, and perhaps even reject them. So those are, those are some of the kinds of individuals that we would not ah, put in a, in a group with each other. Now, I had mentioned earlier, in terms of role balancing; some of the other considerations in that regard. Are there any other questions? 

00:38:25
KEVIN I'm sort of going along the lines of a ah, a marriage and family tracks. And in addition I'm working with adults, I'm working with kids, and I'm wondering if there should be a different number in terms of people participating, depending on the age of the folks involved. 

00:38:40
GEORGE M. GAZDA Well, yes. Ah, that's a good question Kevin. Uhm, I find that for example, when, when we worked with ah, children's groups like, and I have this classification from 5 to 9 that I consider a children group. I, I, and I recommend that we, we treat them in a play setting, play room, and I would not recommend more than, say three ah, children for a given play therapy session at least for one counselor. If you have multiple counsels, you might take another child or so into the group. Now for ah, for pre-adolescents, and I put that in a group of, say 9 to 13 ah, you can have as, as many as five to seven members. And uhm, then of course in some special cases if you have co-counselors, you might even have up to ten, if you wanted a set-up, say a uhm, a, a competition like a half court basketball or something where you would have five members on a team or something. Now, with adolescents and adults, I find that somewhere between 7 and 10 ah, members is appropriate. 

00:39:55
GEORGE M. GAZDA Now, all of these is based on a fundamental principle of the developmental readiness of the individual. The younger they are, the fewer people ah, we can manage to control without being controlling. The issue here is the counselor should be in control of all groups but not controlling. Ah, and ah, with the younger the person usually, the fewer social controls they have learned so the fewer they have built in so the counselor has to set up a setting to be more in control than with the older individuals. 

00:40:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA Now with pre-adolescents, again, we use a combination of say an activity room and ah, and a, ah, ah, conference room or an interview room, we, we can have a few more because ah, they have usually better social control. It's the same way with adolescents and even more so. So, we can increase the numbers. Now, of course, those numbers are decreased so to speak, if the group members are uhm, ah, hyper or aggressive or acting out, then, first of all, we might have a bad mix. And we should do a better role-balancing job. But in fact, uhm, the, we could also control to some degree by limiting the numbers in, in terms of their dis, disability or their, or their disturbance. Ah, again, those with fewer controls have to be fewer in number and monitored ah, more carefully by the ah, counsel, the group counselor. Ah, any other question in that regard? 

00:41:35
CINDY  I have a question. How long were your sessions and how many sessions do you usually give for? 

00:41:40
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Well ah, Cindy that's a, that's a good question. Uhm, the, the, again, we go back to my earlier principle of the readiness, developmental readiness of the ah, group members and ah, ah, the degree of disturbance of the group members. All things considered ah, the more frequent you hold the group, and the more often you hold it, the more intense the group becomes. That's just a general rule of thumb. So, kind of keep that in mind. But let's go back and be a little more specific than that. Let's say age, the age group from 5 to 9, ah, somewhere between the half hour and then the hour, ah, usually not quite an hour, would, be the typical amount of time that we would ah, would have to allow them. Ah, maybe ah, a good, a good figure would be 40 to 45 minutes. This is in a playroom. Of course, their attention span is less than older individuals and you have to take that into consideration. So, that, that's what we would generally set up for that age group. 

00:42:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA Now, the duration, again ah, I find that ah, we'd probably expect too much gain or change from individuals in short, in short groups. And I would ah, I would ah, recommend that ah, for a play group that, that they run a minimum of ah, 3 to 6 months. Now, if ah, if we have, say the age group of 9 to 13 or the pre-adolescents, again, we can run them because we have a combination of ah, of ah, activity and interview we can usually run the activity for anywhere from a half hour to 45 minutes so that, or possibly even longer. But the total should not exceed an hour and a half and, and an absolute maximum somewhere around 2 hours, and that's usually once or twice a week. Ah, and the duration of those again, I would say probably ah, the same somewhere around ah, 3 to ah, to 6 months; ah, with a group like that, possibly even longer depending upon the degree of disturbance. 

00:44:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA Now, with uhm, when we go to ah, adolescents and adults, I think that ah, the typical time ah, that they need is somewhere around an hour and a, to an hour and a half. Some, some go as long as two hours, again, once or twice a week. And here, the absolute minimum is somewhere around ah, 10 weeks, 8 to 10 weeks. But, I think, usually, ah, I would, I like to schedule them ah, for considerably longer than that. Ah, in fact, 20 weeks would be ah, ah, a good, a good time to shoot for. 

00:44:40
BILL Would you comment again on preferred settings for different age groups? 

00:44:45
PURPOSES OF SETTING / MEDIA 1. Facilitate relationship building 2. Increase potential for communication 3. To test reality 4. Protect child's degree of self-disclosure 5. Provide opportunities for modeling. 6. Facilitate responses that can be rewarded by counselor 7. Maximize use of "release therapy" 

00:44:45
GEORGE M. GAZDA Yeah, before I answer that question, let me ah, refer to some of the purposes of the, a given setting and the media involved in that setting. We try to set up the settings so that it will do a number of things, such as to facilitate development of the relationship. For example, ah, using dolls in the playroom ah, for young children. Increase the potential ah, for their ah, interpersonal communication with ah, each other and with the ah, counselor. And we, the setting is set up to provide a test of reality for the ah, individuals. And of course we, in the children's group, for example, we try to protect the amount of self-disclosure that the child may give by the kind of the media that we make available. Ah, we ah, try to provide for modeling throughout all kinds of groups, both by peer group members and by the ah, group counselor. We try to ah, set up the media so that the ah, responses of the counselor can be used for a, a reward or ah, an encouragement of the ah, counselee. And finally we set up the ah, setting and media to provide cathartic experiences or release therapy for certain individuals. 

00:46:20
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Now, in response to your specific question, Bill, ah, I'd like to break down the settings into three different settings. First beginning in the age group 5 to 9. The playroom is the most appropriate setting ah, for these children, and it's usually a room about 400 square feet and is equipped with a variety of things including such things as ah, dollhouses, ah, we have ah, inflated figures for those who might need to work out some aggression to punch. There are blocks and ah, uhm, peg boards for children who might need to pound peg boards. We have things such as sandbox, clay and a variety of ah, toys that would appeal to different age groups. 

00:47:20
AGES 9 - 13 

00:47:20
GEORGE M. GAZDA The media and setting utilized for the pre-adolescent group ah, can consist of one large room frequently some 600 square feet where there might be a section partitioned for things such as workbenches, table tennis, crafts and video games even a meal table in some cases. And then, ah, another section, ah, typical conference type room where the interview phase of the activity is held following the activity itself. Now, some of these activities can be held in ah, facilities such as ah, the school shop, home, home economics suite, ah, the gymnasium and athletic course. Ah, in that case, then the group will return to the conference room for the follow up or interview phase of the ah, particular session. 

00:48:20
ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS 

00:48:20
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Now for adolescents and adults, since ah, this is typically an interview ah, approach, a typical conference room is okay for that ah, with comfortable chairs. Ah, usually, we avoid having a table in it so that we don't interfere with communication. Ah, that, and then, we also hope that the room is, of course, private and that, ah, that people will not be interrupted by extraneous outside noises. 

00:48:50
SHIRLEY  I don't understand the terms "open group" versus "closed group", but I want if you would be willing to comment on that. 

00:49:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA Shirley, that was a good question. Let me try to comment briefly on the difference between ah, open versus close groups. I view open groups as those groups which have an indeterminate life span ah, as one member leaves the group, a new member is added to replace that member. So, essentially, ah, the group contains the same number of individuals, although different individuals as new members ah, join and old members leave. Close groups simply mean that the groups begin and end with the same ah, individuals and usually for a determined ah, date or specified number of sessions so that ah, the members realize what they are committing themselves to. 

00:49:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA Let's first look at a group of children ages 5 to 9. X line explains the value of play therapy for this group. She states that play therapy is based on the fact that play is the child's natural medium of self-expression. Play therapy is an opportunity given to the child to play out his or her feelings and problems just as in certain types of adult therapy, an individual talks out difficulties. This play and activity should facilitate contact with the child, catharsis in psyche, reality testing, and sublimation. In addition to play therapy, modeling can also be used to work with young children. Because young children have not developed verbally to a high degree, modeling is sometimes pre, referred to as "no trial learning" or "observational learning" can be a very efficient method for changing the behavior of the young child. A model can exhibit a preferred way of behaving, relating or problem solving. This real-life model can be a peer and/or the adult group counselor. Symbolic models can also be used in the form of dolls and puppets and verbally through counselor-read stories, counselor-led plays and psychodrama. 

00:51:10
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Let's now consider another age group in terms of the mini model ah, within my overarching model. The pre-adolescent is in the latency period with an age range from 9 to 13 years. Children in this group are often neglected because they have entered into a period of quiescence. A natural play group consists of the same sex, such as boys prefer to be with boys and girls to be with girls. In this setting, media such as arts and crafts, table games and outdoor activities such as field trips are valuable in the treatment of the pre-adolescent. This kind of group therapy is called activity group therapy or activity interview group therapy or activity group counseling or activity interview group counseling. Sloffs(ph) has stated that while little children gain through play and acting out, young children in their latency period and early adolescence achieve through manual activity, creative expression, and free play and interaction with one another. The typical adolescent and adult have achieved a stage in their development where the most natural and efficient communication medium is language or verbalizing. 

00:52:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA Thus, with this age group, interview group counseling is the preferred mode of treatment. The counseling or therapy model that is most consistent with my developmental model and that describes the process of change that occurs in a counseling intervention focusing on counseling verbalization is the cognitive behavioral model of Donald Meichenbaum. Meichenbaum describes his model as an integrative approach and considers inside development as involving both cognitive and affective domains, and that frequently the coping mechanisms mediated through these domains must be taught. I agree with this conceptualization. The change process according to Meichenbaum, consists of three interwoven phases. Phase I is self-observation where the counselees observe their own behavior in a self-exploration fashion. Phase II concerns the counselees' initiations, cognitions, and behaviors that interfere with the maladaptive ones. This phase, I believe, is similar to the understanding phase in my developmental model. Phase III of Meichenbaum's model has to do with the counselees admitting coping behaviors in vivo and what the counselees say to the self about the outcome of these experiments. Insofar as the developmental model also includes teaching new attitudes and behavior-based on a consistent model for given life skill areas, these two models do not appear to be inconsistent with each other. What I have attempted to do in this relatively brief time was to present the rational for an overarching developmental group counseling model that subsumes three different approaches appropriate for three different age groups. First, play group counseling that takes place in the playroom with children ages 5 to 9. Second, activity interview group counseling that takes place in a recreational setting, followed by interviews in a conference style room with gender segregated groups ages 9 to 13. And three, interview group counseling that takes place in a conference style room with adolescents 13 to 20 or adults 20 and older. For each of these three age groups, I have tried to show why three different theoretical models are necessary and within each why this selection composition, size, length and duration of treatment, setting and media utilized are different for each of the separate age groups. Brief simulations of groups in action were used to illustrate how I begin a group. The phases of group development, some therapeutic factors, and dealing with problem members in a group. I hope the information will be useful to those of you and discuss this video. 

00:55:35
PART 2 SOCIAL / LIFE SKILLS TRAINING 

00:55:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA  In this section, I will discuss the rationale for the life skills or social skills training model and place it in perspective with group counseling and therapy. Once again, you will hear discussions between me and my students and see brief simulations to illustrate intervention or training strategies. Of the two terms that I use to describe skills training, that is social and life skills, social skills training has become the generic and most accepted term in the professional literature. It is reported to have been developed in the 1960s and 70s with the work of Ziegler(ph) and Philips(ph) in the United States, and Wilford(ph) and Argyle(ph) in England. There are several strands of related training groups. 

00:56:35
SKILLS TRAINING GROUPS 

00:56:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA Mosher(ph) and Springals(ph) delivered psychological education. Drama knots(ph), structured groups, carcuffs(ph) human resource development, ivies(ph), micro counseling, Goldstein's(ph), structured learning therapy, Atkins life skills education, Lazarus's(ph), multimodal behavior therapy and Gurney's(ph) relationship enhancement. Let's sit in on a discussion of Social Skills Training. 

00:57:05
 Dr. Gazda, how would you describe social skills or life skills training? 

00:57:10
GEORGE M. GAZDA Well, let's first look at Goldsmith and McFalls'(ph) description of social skills training. Social skills training is a general therapy approach aimed at increasing performance confidence in critical life situations in contrast to the therapies aimed at the elimination of maladaptive behavior, skills training emphasizes the positive educational aspects of treatment. It assumes that individuals do the best they can in every learning situation, given any physical limitations and unique learning history. Thus, when an individual's best effort is judged to be maladaptive, this indicates the presence of a situation's specific skill deficit in the individual's repertoire whatever the design or origin of the deficit, it often maybe overcome through appropriate training in more skillful response alternatives. With this description of social skills in mind, I define life skills as all those skills and knowledge prerequisite to development of the skills in addition to academic skills that are necessary for effective living. 

00:58:30
DEBBIE  How do social skills training develop into a therapeutic strategy? 

00:58:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Ziegler(ph) and Philips(ph) were focused on the concept of social confidence which stated that effective social functioning depends on a set of abilities which some people lack. Their work also suggested that poor social functioning, that is low confidence could lead to psychopathology rather than always resulting from it. Ziegler(ph) and Philips(ph) demonstrated in their research, that the greater the prior social confidence of hospital admitted patients, the shorter their length of stay in the hospital, and the lower the recidivism rate. The level of social confidence prior to hospitalization turned out to be a better predictor of post hospitalization than psychiatric diagnosis or the particular type of treatment received in the hospital. 

00:59:30
KEVIN  I kind if wonder sometimes when you see a lot of psychopathology clients were they might be related to social skills deficits. 

00:59:40
GEORGE M. GAZDA There are a number of hypotheses that have been generated the etiological basis for poor social performance. Perhaps the most documented and researched hypothesis is the skill deficit hypothesis of Arnold Lazarus(ph). You will note that on the diagram ah, this represents Lazarus'(ph) explanation of ah, of the deficit hypothesis. At A, the person is really in the womb and is really endowed with certain genetic characteristics. At B, the person is born into the world and begins moving along ah, life's pathway, until at C, because of a number of deficits in his or her ah, life, the person deviates from the normal pathway of social adaptive living, and at D becomes somewhat dysfunctional. 

01:00:45
SKILLS DEFICIT TRAINING 

01:00:45
GEORGE M. GAZDA Now this ah, simple ah, diagram simply shows that in order to help the person get back on the ah, pathway of poor social living, that something has to be done to fill in the deficits encountered at C. The training usually consists of five techniques. First, instructions, second, modeling, third, role play, fourth, feedback and social reinforcement, and fifth, practice and homework. 

01:01:20
GEORGE M. GAZDA Let's look at a simulation of a group in action demonstrating how interpersonal communication skills training might work. What we're going to try to do today is work on our interpersonal communications training model and we're going to begin with ah, learning how to identify what we might consider helpee(ph) ah, requests. We don't have to consider these people helpee(ph), but whenever somebody is making a request of another, it may well be that they are some sort of helpee(ph). And we have developed this chart to illustrate that we can classify almost every request we get from others into four categories. One is request for action. An example of that might be, say, your youngster says to you, "Mommy, would you tie my shoe?" That's a request for action, and you decide whether to do it or not do it. Ah, a request for information, a person simply ah, maybe a stranger in town who drives up alongside you and says, "Could you tell me how to find the First National Bank?" And if you know you tell him how to get there. That's a request for information. 

01:02:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA Then there's a request for what we call inappropriate interaction. And these requests are many and varied, but let's just take a few basic examples of those. They can be requests for, these are kind of hidden requests, dependency relationships for example, people who try to create a dependency relationship with you. Not only by what they say, but also by what they do. And then there's request for inappropriate interaction such as gossip and rumor-spreading, and people will start to gossip with you or perhaps spread a rumor, and then you have to deal, decide how you're going to respond to that. 

01:03:15
GEORGE M. GAZDA And then the fourth kind of request, we call an understanding, an involvement request, or a request for people who want something of almost a counseling nature with you, not in the formal sense, a professional sense, but at least, they want to be understood and they're working on some kind of problem that's of a concern of them and they need some help with working on their problems. So, they don't usually need a yes or a no type of answer or direction or anything of that sort. They need an extended involvement with you to some degree, or at least more extended than the other areas would be. So, what we're going to do then is first of all, try to see if we can just spontaneously ah, come up with a few requests and then respond to them and ah, see how it goes and we can practice that here this afternoon. Ah, I wonder, Allen, if you would make a request of me and I'll illustrate ah, here what I mean by this. 

01:04:15
ALLEN Okay. Dr. Gazda, I think I have request for information and that would be, "How would a person go about changing their program of study at the university?" 

01:04:25
GEORGE M. GAZDA Okay. You'd have to start with your major professor, Allen, and he would have, he or she would have to agree that what you're wanting to change is consistent with your program and also with the university regulations. So, I would say that just start with your major professor. Go to him or her and they should be able to tell you where to go from there and whether or not it's something that really ah, you're, you're gonna be able to do in the first place. 

01:05:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. So, what we did here is Allen kind of tipped it off. He labeled it before, before he asked me, but ah, if had not, I would have simply answered him in an informational sort of way so that he could take it from there and go on with it. I wonder if we could have some volunteers at this point now to say role play an interaction and ah, then ah, I'll ah, classify it and you can classify it, too, and then ah, we'll discuss whether or not it was that kind of request. Who would like to volunteer to do that? 

01:05:40
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. Astrid you and Shirley, why don't you ask her; Astrid, why don't you move your chair in front of Shirley's and Kevin, would you just back out a moment here while they practice this. Okay. So, who's going to do what? 

01:06:00
SHIRLEY I'm gonna ask the question? (crosstalk) 

01:06:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA You're gonna be the helpee(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:06:00
ASTRID I'll be the helpee(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:06:00
SHIRLEY Yes. 

01:06:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA You're going to be the helper. Okay, why don't you then proceed. 

01:06:05
SHIRLEY  Uhm, Astrid, uhm, I just wanted to talk to you about this problem I have and that is that my boyfriend seems to not understand how busy and how tired I am on the weekend, but my family does. My mother and my sisters they're always at family occasions, and they seem to get really hurt if I can't attend everything as I used to. And so, I'm really doubting now how to ah, attend to school and my own personal needs and also to my family happy. 

01:06:40
ASTRID Uh hmm. Yeah, Shirley, you seemed to be frustrated because you don't know how to manage between your boyfriend's needs and your parent's needs. 

01:06:45
SHIRLEY Uh hmm, and my own. (crosstalk) 

01:06:50
ASTRID And your own needs too. 

01:06:50
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. Astrid, you made a determination that that was what kind of request. 

01:06:55
ASTRID  Oh! Looks like it was for understanding and involvement. 

01:07:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA Right. Right, uh-huh. And ah, you responded ah, generally pretty well. You said you're frustrated. I'm not sure that's the best affective word to use, but it's, it's somewhat in the ballpark. Ah, she's certainly ah, discouraged; it sounds like, with her inability to satisfy everybody, and troubled by it to some respect. So what you were, you were letting her know at least that you heard some of the ah, part of the problem at least. What, what I think might have been missed is that she also talked about ah, her, her own needs and her boyfriends needs. Her family seems to be now the issue here that they didn't understand her unavailability, that the boyfriend did, that she's got it worked out otherwise. So we might have touched a little bit on that. But the important thing here is that you did understand, that was request for understanding involvement and gave that kind of response. Okay. So that, that's good. Ah, why don't you just resume your positions there in your seats, and now ah, now ah, what I'd like to suggest, as a kind of a follow-up for this then in, in homework, is to, for the next 24 hours, so you'll be sensitized to, to what people, what request people make of you, is to record the different requests that people make of you during this next 24 hours. And if possible, maybe, even on a, some of them indicate what your response was. So remember now, we got action, request for action, information, inappropriate interaction, understanding and involvement. If you'll just do that, and then we'll, we'll discuss those ah, at the beginning of our next session ah, tomorrow. Okay. 

01:09:00
GEORGE M. GAZDA (inaudible ) closer at the conditioned anxiety and model. In social skills training programs, based on the conditioned anxiety model, which assumes that the individual has the requisite skills in his or her repertoire, but is inhibited from responding in a socially appropriate fashion because of conditioned anxiety responses. Anxiety reduction techniques constitute the primary components of the training protocol. Let's now look closer at the conditioned anxiety model. 

01:09:35
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Now, clench both fists in you forearms. Now relax completely and feel the tension leave the fist, forearm and the remainder of your body. Now I want you to imagine a very peaceful and relaxing scene. 

01:10:10
[sil.] 

01:10:10
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. Now fix that scene in your mind so that you can return to it later. We are going to work on anxiety reduction of test taking. If you feel any anxiety about what I'm saying, please raise your forearm. Imagine that you are sitting at your desk, just getting ready to study for a mid-term exam. If that makes you anxious, raise your arm. Okay, switch it OFF and imagine the peaceful, restful scene that I asked you to generate. Take several deep breaths and let your body relax completely. 

01:11:05
[sil.] 

01:11:05
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. You are sitting at your desk, preparing to study for a mid-term. If that makes you anxious, raise your arm. Okay, switch it OFF. Remember, return to the peaceful, restful scene. 

01:11:40
[sil.] 

01:11:40
GEORGE M. GAZDA  Okay. Now after having studied for three hours, you are walking into the classroom to take the mid-term. If that makes you anxious, raise your arm. Okay, switch it OFF and return to your peaceful, restful image, taking several deep breaths. 

01:12:10
GEORGE M. GAZDA  The demonstration was just a brief illustration of how the conditioned anxiety model is employed by using a system of desensitization for a test-taking anxiety. Although I have been describing social skills training primarily in the remedial mode, I believe that its greatest potential lies in its preventive mode. I contend that we have never had a good preventive mental health model or physical model until recently for that matter, because our models are basically medical models oriented to treating disabilities or illness. With the training skills models, we can now intervene with comprehensive skills training programs in all our institutions. Because I believe that we in accounting profession must stress preventive mental health, at least, if not more than remedial intervention. I have proposed a developmental model life skills training, in which the emphasize is taking life skills through model development in the four generic life skill areas that my students and I have isolated. These four generic life skills are: interpersonal communications/ human relations, problem-solving/decision making, identify development/purpose-in-life, and physical fitness/health maintenance. My reason for using the term life-skills training has set a social skills training instead of social skills training is that I include physical fitness and health maintenance as one area for skills training, which doesn't really fit the definition of social skills. 

01:13:55
 You stated earlier that you used the term Life Skills Training, do you have our own theoretical model for Life Skills Training? 

01:14:05
GEORGE M. GAZDA Ah, yes, I do. I'd like to outline ah, the essence of this theoretical model through a series of 10 basic assumptions. Ah, first, there are at least 7 well-defined areas of human development; psychosocial, physical sexual, vocational, cognitive, ego, moral and affective. Second, using the attitudes and behavior specified by the theorist, we have identified approximately 300 Life Skills from the 7 areas of human development. Third, in reference to Kohlberg's Moral Stage Development Theory, for example, moral development is growth, and like all growth, it take place according to a predetermined sequence. Fourth, in early childhood, for example, achieving an appropriate dependence- independence pattern represents the developmental task. The coping behavior is necessary to complete his tasks, require adjusting to less private attention and becoming independent physically while remaining strongly dependent emotionally. Fifth, a developmental model, whether age or stage-related assumes that mastery of concepts and skills in an aerial level is pre-requisite to mastery of more advanced concepts and skills. Sixth, individuals achieve optimal functioning when they attain operational mastery of fundamental life skills. Seventh, Casten(ph) stated that social behaviors occupy an important role in the definition of behavior of psychotic patient's as evidenced by withdrawal, irrational statements, blunted affect and difficulty in communication skills. These behaviors do not begin to exhaust the symptoms of psychiatric patients but illustrate the role of social behavior in identifying the psychopathology. Eighth, the position taken in the, in the Life Skills Training Model is that if individuals are taught the sub-skills of the four generic life skills during the optimum period for them to be learned, and if in fact, they are learned, the cumulative effect would be to enable them to contend effectively with life's problems and therefore be less subject to mental and emotional disturbances. This assumption represents the basis for the preventive mental health contention of this model. Ninth, if one assumes that person suffering from emotional or mental disturbances that are not the result of organic origin, are so affected because they lack appropriate coping skills in one or more of the generic life skill areas, then instruction and/or training that develops coping skills will result in a remediation of these skill deficits and the person will be able to cope effectively. And tenth, consultation and research by me and a team, headed by Mildred Powell(ph), in a psychiatric hospital over a period of about 20 years, has suggested that hospitalized patient suffering from multiple life skill deficits really suffer ah, more because they have a multiple deficits. Furthermore, remediation of these patient's requires multiple life skill training interventions. These multiple life skill interventions have been shown by Powell(ph), by May(ph), and by Elowsky(ph) to result in significant improvement by psychiatric patients. 

01:18:05
GEORGE M. GAZDA  In conclusion, I believe that a Life Span Development Model of Skills Training hold the most promise for the human services profession, and especially if we can develop a comprehensive curriculum in life skills training for all grades in our schools, beginning with kindergarten through college. Other opportunities exist in business and industry through wellness programs if we include social, psychological, as well as physical wellness. We need therefore to emphasize the social psychological aspects of wellness and I think that a social or life skills training model offers the best approach when combined with traditional developmental group counseling approaches. You may use the descriptors in the appendix of Foundation's of Counseling and Human Services by Gazda, Children and Brooks, published by McGraw-Hill in 1987, to compose your own skills training program. How to select trainees, compose training groups, determine size, length, duration of training and so forth can be found in this text. Self-report life skills assessment inventories are under development for children, adolescents, college students and adults. Thank you for your interest in social or life skills training.
