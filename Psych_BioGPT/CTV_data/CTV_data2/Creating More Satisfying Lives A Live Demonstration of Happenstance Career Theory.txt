Creating More Satisfying Lives: A Demonstration of the Happenstance Learning Theory Sponsored by the Japan Career Development Association (JCDA) Ryoji Tatsuno, President of JCDA 

00:00:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Caroline,- 

00:00:15
Establishing context and expectations for today's activities 

00:00:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  -you and I are here making a film for the JCDA and it's gonna be seen by hundreds or thousands of people, and we are going to talk about, ah, career counseling and we're actually going do some career counseling and you have volunteered to be a client and I don't know what you're going, what's your problem is or what's your concern is, but we're just gonna play it by ear and, ah, make it up as we go along. 

00:00:50
Open-ended questioning to elicit client concerns 

00:00:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And so, I'm ah, I'm curious as to, ah, what kind of, ah, concerns you have and, ah, ah, what kind, what, what brings you here today? What's on your mind? 

00:01:00
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, well now, I'm a third year in my doctoral program, so I'm kinda thinking about what I wanna do after, uhm, I graduate... (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
CAROLINE LEE ...and what would be the best career options to... 

00:01:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
CAROLINE LEE ...uhm, for me. 

00:01:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Hmm. 

00:01:15
CAROLINE LEE And I'm kind of considering different options and I'm not really sure which direction I should go and what would be the most fulfilling... 

00:01:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. 

00:01:20
CAROLINE LEE ...uhm, for me. 

00:01:25
Guessing about the feeling desired from the options 

00:01:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, you wanna do something that's gonna make you happy, right? 

00:01:25
CAROLINE LEE Yes. 

00:01:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ You do. Ah, so what, what kind of, ah, options are you thinking about? 

00:01:30
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, well I'm thinking about, uhm, being licensed as a psychologist. 

00:01:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. 

00:01:35
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, and I'm also thinking maybe working in, uhm, a university setting, maybe as, ah, either professor. Uhm, so... (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
CAROLINE LEE I'm not really sure if I wanna practice, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
CAROLINE LEE ...psychology, as a psychologist or I should, uhm, go more at the academic route. (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, and then do counseling on the side, so I'm not really sure. 

00:02:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. 

00:02:00
Assessing the urgency of an immediate decision 

00:02:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  All right. But, uhm, but do you feel that you need to decide right now? 

00:02:10
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, I feel a little bit of pressure to decide just coz, uhm, if I wanted to get license as a psychologist, I would need to start looking for post doc internships. 

00:02:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. 

00:02:20
CAROLINE LEE And that would need to occur probably within the next year. So, I know like I always change later on, but if want to be licensed, there is like, I feel like there's a certain path I need to be taking. 

00:02:35
Paraphrasing client and suggesting a double benefit 

00:02:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ So what you're saying, if you need to be licensed as a psychologist, you need to complete this, ah, post doctoral training. 

00:02:40
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  You have to get a total of three thousand hours of... (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Experience. 

00:02:45
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:02:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Uhm, and with that, ah, that would be licensed as a psychologist, maybe help you also in finding an academic position? 

00:02:55
CAROLINE LEE Perhaps yeah. 

00:02:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  So it wouldn't be necessarily incompatible? 

00:03:00
CAROLINE LEE Yeah, Yeah. Uhm, I think that could be compatible also with looking for a job that's just time wise. I'm also concerned about being able to, uhm, finish my dissertation to look for a post doc, uhm, continue my internship now. 

00:03:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
CAROLINE LEE While still, uhm, focusing on which, uhm, career I want to, to have in the future. 

00:03:30
Asking client to fantasize a future job offer 

00:03:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Le, le, let me ask you a sort of a strange question. 

00:03:35
CAROLINE LEE Okay. 

00:03:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Ah, suppose that you could, uhm, decree a miracle and all of a sudden, you had an offer of, of a, a, a job that was just so beautiful, so perfect, so delightful that you just would say, " Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'll take it." 

00:03:55
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ What would that offer have to be, ah, what would it or how could it be that would make you feel that way? 

00:04:00
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, a job that, uhm, had flexible hours, 

00:04:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yeah. 

00:04:05
CAROLINE LEE  you're not inside the whole entire day, 

00:04:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yeah. 

00:04:10
CAROLINE LEE uhm, interaction with people. 

00:04:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Yes. 

00:04:15
CAROLINE LEE I would want to feel like I'm helping or, uhm, being able to assist people... (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
CAROLINE LEE ...in one way or another. 

00:04:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. 

00:04:20
CAROLINE LEE So, some kind of element of, uhm, just helping and also, uhm, good pay... 

00:04:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yes. 

00:04:30
CAROLINE LEE ...and, uhm, uhm, 

00:04:30
Making fantasy more specific 

00:04:30
CAROLINE LEE  I think, good, uhm, any flexible schedule would be, definitely a big part of that. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ All right. Now, but now let us make more specific now. 

00:04:40
CAROLINE LEE Okay. 

00:04:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Suppose the, ah, closure of home denied and, ah, a telephone rings and you picked it up and, ah, somebody says to you, "Are, are you Caroline Lee?," you say, "yes", "well, I have an offer for you and I wanna tell you about it". What, what would that offer be specifically, and, and you're gonna have flexible hours... 

00:05:05
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ .."and you got, and, and we're gonna pay you, ah, five hundred thousand dollars a (laugh) year to start... 

00:05:10
CAROLINE LEE Uh huh. 

00:05:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...ah, with guaranteed raise up to, ah, whatever units", I want you to sort of fantasize as to what, ah, what would be, and what, and what kind of work would you be doing, see, to fantasize a little bit... (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
CAROLINE LEE  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...more about it. 

00:05:25
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, I suppose, I can think of a couple different things. I think one would be an offer to maybe work part time at, like in University and Counseling Center... 

00:05:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. 

00:05:35
CAROLINE LEE ...and then other would be, part time working at, uhm, maybe like a community clinic focusing on Asian-American mental health issues coz those are my research interest... 

00:05:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
CAROLINE LEE ...so, uhm, I would think ah, 

00:05:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
CAROLINE LEE those two kind of things pop,- 

00:05:55
Summarizing clients fantasy 

00:05:55
CAROLINE LEE - pop ah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ All right, so, so that, that's the offer. Ah, you did, you, you, we want you to work at two different jobs... 

00:06:00
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:06:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...the, ah, the, the counseling center at the university... 

00:06:05
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and then, and then the community, ah, center...(crosstalk) 

00:06:05
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and they specializes in Asian-American issues, okay. And, and, and the pay is gonna be how much, uhm, what, what, you know, then, in a fantasy, what, how much pay are you gonna get for this? 

00:06:20
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, six figures. 

00:06:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Six figure, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  A hundred thousand or more per year? 

00:06:25
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. Okay. And, uhm, and, and, and what are the terms, ah, are you, ah, are you asking for? 

00:06:35
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, so being able to sched my, set my own schedule. 

00:06:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And set your own schedule... 

00:06:40
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...as to how may hours you spend here and how many hours you spend there. 

00:06:45
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:06:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Depending on what, what, what you think is most important to do. 

00:06:45
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:06:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm, okay, all right, all right, that, that's great. Now, uhm, now- 

00:06:55
Asking for an action Now that might make the fantasy happen 

00:06:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - your wish is going to be granted if, if what would you have to do now to make that happen? 

00:07:10
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. Uhm, well, I would have to be a licensed psychologist for... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
CAROLINE LEE ...that to happen. 

00:07:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ All right, so you, so, that, that's the one thing you're gonna have to work toward... (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...to becoming a licensed psychologist. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. But then another issue is, since right now, I'm doing my internship, I'm trying to figure out... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
CAROLINE LEE ...if counseling is the best fit for me, too, and it's, coz I'm not, I haven't, you know, had the opportunity to do it as a real occupation. 

00:07:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
CAROLINE LEE  So, I feel like I don't know exactly if, what if, you know, I go into that job and it's, I don't like counseling later. 

00:07:45
Acknowledging that the client might not like a future job 

00:07:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well that could happen. 

00:07:45
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  It could go, it, that could easily happen that you could, you could get this great offer and you to say "Oh, that sounds perfect", and you could go and you could start working there and, and, and you're doing some counseling in the counseling center and you say, "Gosh, I hate this. These people come in with all these terrible problems, I have to listen to them, and, and I get so bored with them. I gotta do something else," see, you might say that, okay. Now, would that be a catastrophe for you if, ah, if you have to change your mind? 

00:08:15
CAROLINE LEE  Uhm, not a catastrophe but it'd be disappointing to I guess feel that I've put all this energy into doing this and then I don't like it (laughs). 

00:08:30
Refuting the metaphor that training is an investment that must be preserved 

00:08:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, it, it might seem that way but, but there's another way of looking at this, see. It, it, because this does happen to a lot of people. The, they start off in one direction and they find out, "Hey this is not at all what I thought it would be. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And, and I really don't like doing this... 

00:08:50
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:08:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and, but they, but they, but they'll to themselves, "Hey I've invested so much time and money into this field that I've gotta stick into it... (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...stick with it because, ah, otherwise I lose my investment", okay? Now, I don't know if this is what you were sort of worried about. But there's another way of looking at it, which is, that it's not an investment that you knew... 

00:09:15
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:09:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...because everything that you have learned as part of your training is going to be good for you no matter where you go. Now, I bet, you are learning a lot of counseling skills, okay. Now, wherever you go, those counseling skills are gonna be valuable. 

00:09:30
CAROLINE LEE  Yeah. That's true. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ So, so, so even if, even if you discover that your... (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...you, you, your, your wish comes true... 

00:09:45
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and you get this, this job with the two roles and, and one of them you don't like, you might say, "Well, hell with it, I'm gonna, I'm gonna quit doing that and I'm gonna spend more time with the other one... (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
CAROLINE LEE  Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...but then, but then you might discover, "Hey, this other job I don't like either." 

00:10:00
CAROLINE LEE  Yeah. I guess it's the fear of like not having, or the fear of, "Well, if I don't like this, then what would I do then", kinda thing, the fear of not knowing. 

00:10:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Right. The fear of not knowing... (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
CAROLINE LEE Yeah, what, 

00:10:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and what's gonna happen next? (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
CAROLINE LEE what's the backup plan if that doesn't work out? 

00:10:20
Remaining flexible at the time unexpected events occur 

00:10:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And that's, oh boy, now you come right down to the heart of the matter. 

00:10:20
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ What's the back-up plan in case, ah, this doesn't work out, and you think what's, ah, am, ah, am I gonna just go down the tube, is that gonna be the end of life, see. And, and the, the, the Happenstance Learning Approach is that unexpected things always happen... 

00:10:40
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and one of the unexpected things is that you might not like what you have been trained to do. 

00:10:45
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:10:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And, and, and see it and you, and you worry about that as if, coz you don't have a back-up plan, see. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ But the truth is that if something like that happens, you figure out something else to do, okay? It's not the end world. This is, this is the whole joy of this approach is- 

00:11:10
Making back-up plans is unnecessary and a waste of time 

00:11:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - that you remain flexible all the time, and if plan A doesn't work out, you go to plan B and, but you don't have a plan B as yet. It doesn't matter, you make up plan B when you get there... 

00:11:20
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  and if plan B doesn't work, now you go to plan C, but you don't know what that as yet, but you wait until plan B goes down the tube and then (laughs) you figure out plan C. You don't have to plan your whole life in advance. 

00:11:35
CAROLINE LEE So, so you think that if, uhm, for now, ah, it would be best to just go with what I think is a good plan now and then if it's not a good plan later, then just worry about it then, not worry, now if I don't like it later? 

00:11:50
Keeping the focus on the client's views 

00:11:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ What do you think? 

00:11:50
CAROLINE LEE (laugh) Uhm, I think that's what you're telling me (laughs). 

00:12:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ (laughs) Well, I think it's what I'm telling you, but, but I wanna know what you think. 

00:12:00
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. Uhm, I think, ideally, that would, that would be the best thing to do in terms of focusing now on what, uhm, I think would be the best option at this point in my life... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, and try to not be concerned about what's going, going to happen later. 

00:12:25
Taking one step at a time while doing high-quality work 

00:12:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Ah, we could go, we could, we could spend our whole life making plans, none of which would work. 

00:12:30
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Okay. So, so what, what I have found is that you sort of take life one step at a time and you, and you try things that you think you would like, and you do the best you can... 

00:12:45
CAROLINE LEE  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...in those jobs, and if they don't work out the way you want, well, try something else. 

00:12:55
CAROLINE LEE Well, how do I figure out if counseling is the best fit for me to do? (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
Using practicum, internships and part-time work are useful methods for finding enjoyable work 

00:13:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ You won't know until you become a full-time counselor. 

00:13:05
CAROLINE LEE Okay. 

00:13:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. Or a half-time counselor. 

00:13:05
CAROLINE LEE So there's no way, like now in training, to find like... 

00:13:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
CAROLINE LEE ...figure that out? (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ what you're, what you're doing, you're doing some counseling now in your internship, right? (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:13:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ In your practicum? 

00:13:15
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ How do you like it? 

00:13:15
CAROLINE LEE  Uhm, well, I'm working with the children, and I've worked with couples... (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
CAROLINE LEE ...and I've worked with adults. So, I enjoyed the child, working with the children but it's kind of difficult because it's not, a lot of it is play therapy... (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
CAROLINE LEE ...and getting the hang of that is different than talk therapy... 

00:13:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. 

00:13:35
CAROLINE LEE ...with adults. 

00:13:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
CAROLINE LEE I know for sure I don't want to do couple's counseling. 

00:13:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ You know that for sure? 

00:13:40
CAROLINE LEE I know that for sure. Couple's counseling (laughs) is just... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. That, that. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
CAROLINE LEE ...I don't think I can handle that. 

00:13:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ All right, okay, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
Giving permission to change one's mind later about the desirability of specific work tasks 

00:13:45
CAROLINE LEE So, so. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ So, so for right now, now see, ah, you might change your mind later on. 

00:13:50
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:13:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I mean, after you, after you get married... (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and you might say, "Hey! I wanna help people figure out how to get along with their spouse." 

00:13:55
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:13:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ But right now, that's not, that's not on your radar screen? (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:14:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Fine, (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ fine. So you're interested in working with children and, and ah, 

00:14:05
CAROLINE LEE Maybe like a college population. 

00:14:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ and with a college population. 

00:14:10
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. But I haven't had that much opportunity to work with college age yet. 

00:14:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Okay. Uhm, do you like working with children? 

00:14:15
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. I really enjoy... 

00:14:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Are you really working with children? (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
CAROLINE LEE ...being around child, yeah, but then, I feel like working with children and counseling children is kind of different. 

00:14:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, okay. Because you, because of the sort of the, the talk counseling doesn't work with the children. That would get some. (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
CAROLINE LEE It's, it's more difficult, yeah. 

00:14:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yeah, yeah. So, you, so you have to approach the children in a different way... 

00:14:35
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  through, through playing things. 

00:14:40
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. Uhm, but,- 

00:14:40
Seeing advantages of trying out a variety of work activities and settings 

00:14:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - but, but, the, the, really to me the, the wonderful thing about your doing right now is you're trying out these things. 

00:14:50
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:14:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And you might try doing some different things for the children. 

00:14:50
CAROLINE LEE  Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I don't know what kind of games you're playing with them maybe. Maybe you wanna experiment with some different kinds of games, get, get, get them involved and... (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  thinking about. Their social skills, let's say. And some of the children are, are mean to each other, I mean do you ever have children that are bullying each other? 

00:15:10
CAROLINE LEE  Yeah. I have the ones being bullied and the one bullying. 

00:15:15
Encouraging experimentation with different ways of working on difficult problems 

00:15:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, there you go, you see. (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
CAROLINE LEE  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I mean, and, and, and this is not a very happy situation for, especially the child that's being bullied... 

00:15:25
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and, and you wanna, you probably wanna get in there and figure out something that really help, (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Right? 

00:15:30
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And well, would that be kind of, ah, interesting challenge for you to deal with? 

00:15:35
CAROLINE LEE Yeah, that's kind of like the stuff I'm dealing with now already. 

00:15:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yeah, yeah, yeah, and do you like doing that? 

00:15:40
CAROLINE LEE Yeah, I do. 

00:15:40
Sensing and feelings 

00:15:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  You sound a little doubtful? 

00:15:45
CAROLINE LEE (laughs) Uhm, I guess it depends on, you know, how, I guess for me I really like to know that I've made a difference or I've helped... 

00:15:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
CAROLINE LEE ...and with children, in that kind of situation, you don't, and with counseling, I think in general, you don't get those immediate results and I like to know that, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yes, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
CAROLINE LEE ...I am, I'm being productive and helpful... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ All right. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
CAROLINE LEE And that, uhm, you know, what I'm doing, does make some sort of a change issue(ph). 

00:16:10
Using a desired change in behavior as an indicator of success 

00:16:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ But, but if the bully stops bullying... 

00:16:15
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...wouldn't that be a wonderful change? (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. That would. 

00:16:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ All right. And so you, but you, so you could observe whether... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...that happens or not. And that would make you happy if it did happen? 

00:16:25
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:16:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And if it didn't happen, you'd say, "Hmm, I have to try something else." 

00:16:30
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:16:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ So, so what, what impresses me so far in what you have told me is that- 

00:16:35
Giving positive reinforcement for current actions 

00:16:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - that you are already doing the kinds of things, trying out things and testing them to see how you like them. 

00:16:40
CAROLINE LEE  Yeah. Next, next year, I'm gonna be in the high school instead, to try on a different population... 

00:16:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. That's great. (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
CAROLINE LEE ...to see how that is. 

00:16:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ That's great. So then you'll see what it's like to counsel with high school students. 

00:16:55
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. I was debating whether or not I should stay with elementary coz it seems, it would be the easier thing to do. 

00:17:00
Giving more reinforcement for trying a new work setting -- not the easiest alternative 

00:17:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  It would be the easier thing, but you wouldn't find out what it was like to work with high school students. 

00:17:05
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:17:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  And it sounds to me like you wanted to sort of test the waters... 

00:17:10
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And see. See, I, I think what you're doing is just, ah, really great, Caroline. You're just, you're just trying out these different things and, ah, you're testing the waters... 

00:17:20
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  to see what it's like and, ah, and you don't have to plan the whole, your whole life. 

00:17:30
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. I suppose it's the fear of like wanting to like master something and not being, you know, not being able to reach that point just yet. It's kind of, you know, the hard part, (laugh) too. 

00:17:45
Advocating constant learning, not mastery 

00:17:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ You know, I, I don't know anybody that really has mastered, ah, anything, you know. We're, we're, we're all, we're all learning to any sort of, especially in this, the field of counseling, we're all learning everyday,- 

00:17:55
Self-disclosing 

00:17:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - everyday, I learn something new. 

00:18:00
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Sometimes people ask me, "Well, what, what, what do you do," and I say, "Ah, well, I'm a learner", "A learner, what's that?" "Well, I'm, I'm just, ah, my job is just to keep on learning all the time, everywhere I go." "Wow, an interesting job" (laughs). See, and, and, and it's a, ah, if, if you, if you think of your activities and so... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...constantly a learning and improving your skill, and you never, you never master anything, really, to even, see, a lot thing that I, I love that I play tennis, and I, I'd like to watch some of the really top tennis players. 

00:18:35
Normalizing errors 

00:18:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And, and, you know, they all make unforced errors, every single one, the very best tennis player in the world makes ten or twelve unforced errors in a set. 

00:18:45
CAROLINE LEE  Yeah. 

00:18:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Nobody, nobody masters the game. 

00:18:50
CAROLINE LEE Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Ah, and the same is true, football, basketball, I mean nobody is perfect. 

00:19:00
Showing that improvement is possible -- perfection is not 

00:19:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And so, so, so trying to be a master in the sense of being perfect at something is impossible. And, and, and if you try to be perfect, you're gonna be unhappy your whole life. 

00:19:10
CAROLINE LEE  I, I, I think that's true. And I like your idea about not, you know, planning having, needing everything at planned... 

00:19:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yeah. 

00:19:20
CAROLINE LEE  I, but I think it's harder for me to, you know, like how do I put that into, you know, I think that's, that's true but to really believe that and not worry about that. I, I, how do I- 

00:19:35
Stimulating thought about the origin of the belief that life should be planned in advance 

00:19:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I, I, I, I... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
CAROLINE LEE - go without doing that. (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I understand, (laughs) I understand what you're saying, I understand what you're saying, because, why, and why is that true? Why is it that we think that we should plan our whole life in advance? 

00:19:45
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, I don't know. 

00:19:45
Sharing view that the necessity of planning has been pervasively taught; in home and school 

00:19:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  See, I think we've been trained to believe that. 

00:19:50
CAROLINE LEE Yeah. 

00:19:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ See, and one of the things I'm trying to do with the Happenstance Learning Theory Approach is to convince people that this notion that you have to plan your whole life in advance is nonsense. And, and, and, what a, but is nonsense that has been fostered by our, our whole society. You know, parents ask their children from age three, "Wha, what you, what do you wanna be when you grow up?" "Well I like to be a fireman." "Well, I don't think that's what you really wanna be. I think you wanna be an investment banker." "Wa, what's that?" I mean, I mean, kids don't have the slightest idea, so they, they just say whatever comes into their head. But, but the, but, but the feeling that you should plan in advance, see, it started in the home and in schools, trying to get kids to name what their future occupation is gonna be so that they take the right courses. And the whole society, ah, tries to brainwash us, into thinking we should plan life in advance. But what I have learned- 

00:21:00
Reporting evidence that few adults are engaged in occupations planned in advance 

00:21:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - from talking to many adults, if I, if I go around and I ask, you know, a hundred adults, so, ah, what job do you have now? Okay. And, and what was the job that you said you wanted when you were 18 years old. Almost none of them, at most one percent will say, ah, well, ah, I'm doing the same thing that I thought I would do when I was 18, (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
CAROLINE LEE Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ but 99 percent were now doing something, something different. So- 

00:21:30
Noting that people change their minds, and the available work opportunities change too 

00:21:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - so the way the real world works is that people cannot plan what's going to happen in the future. And they really shouldn't because not only, ah, will they change their mind, but the world changes around us, and there are lots of jobs that exist now that never existed before. 

00:21:45
Providing one more bit of positive reinforcement 

00:21:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  So I think you're on the right track, Caroline. 

00:21:55
CAROLINE LEE Okay, thank you. 

00:21:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  And, and, and, ah,- 

00:22:00
Keeping the door open for future counseling whenever the client feels it is needed 

00:22:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - if you, but, if you wanna talk about it some more, ah, I'll be available, and I'd be happy to talk to you further. 

00:22:05
CAROLINE LEE Okay. Thank you, John. 

00:22:10
What Was the Counselor Thinking? Michi Mizuno Interviewing John Krumboltz 

00:22:10
MICHI MIZUNO  Well, uhm, first of all, I would like to thank you for this demonstration and precious time for us to learn about your theory. 

00:22:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ It's my pleasure. 

00:22:20
MICHI MIZUNO Thank you. Uhm, now I would like to ask some questions related to the demonstration you just showed us... 

00:22:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
MICHI MIZUNO ...as well as, to related to your theory. 

00:22:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. 

00:22:30
MICHI MIZUNO  And my first question is, ah, what do you believe as the goal of career counseling? 

00:22:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I'm glad that's your first question because I think the goal has been, that we've had, historically, for a hundred years, is obsolete. 

00:22:50
No longer merely declaring a future occupation 

00:22:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ The goal has been to help people make a career decision as if this was the... 

00:22:55
MICHI MIZUNO Hmm. 

00:22:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...thing that they were gonna do for the rest of their life and we got into the matching model of, ah, measuring people's, ah, the traits, and interest and values and everything and matching them up with what we thought were the traits and values of various occupations, define the one best match. That was the goal. 

00:23:20
MICHI MIZUNO Hmm. 

00:23:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And it is no longer appropriate. It might have been at one time, but it is no longer appropriate because people don't just want to be matched to one particular occupation. People basically want to lead a happy life. 

00:23:35
A better goal: Helping clients learn to take actions to achieve more satisfying career and personal lives 

00:23:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And our goal as career counselors should be to help people find a satisfying life for themselves. And what is satisfying today may not be satisfying tomorrow. And so, they may, they should be free to change. There may be opportunities tomorrow that don't exist today. And so, if something better comes along, they ought to be, feel free to change their mind and move into a new direction. So, our goal should be to help everybody create satisfying lives for themselves, not just to make a career decision. 

00:24:10
MICHI MIZUNO  Uh hmm. Well, with that goal in your mind, what kind of approach have you taken in that demonstration? 

00:24:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, when I was, ah, talking with Caroline, (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
MICHI MIZUNO Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I was trying to help her see that, ah, she, she was kind of thinking about how she should plan her whole life out in advance- 

00:24:35
Giving permission to try alternatives, make mistakes and change direction 

00:24:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - and she was worried about just doing what she was doing now 'coz it might not be working, she might not, might not be happy with it later. And I'm trying to get her permission to change. If she wants to change in the future, it's okay. It's okay to make mistakes. You can try something, whoa, that's the wrong thing. It's okay to discover it's the wrong thing and then to change, okay. The, the mistake that some people make is to think that whatever they have done in the past is an investment that they have to somehow justify in the future by doing the same thing. And that is nonsense because if they were unhappy doing it in the past, they don't, they shouldn't feel that they have to continue to be unhappy... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
MICHI MIZUNO Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...in the future. They ought to be doing something that makes them happier. 

00:25:20
MICHI MIZUNO  It's more, ah, impactful attitude from the career counselors instead of just listening to the clients. 

00:25:30
Providing a mutual conversation actively engaging the client in the process 

00:25:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Oh, well, yes. I, (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
MICHI MIZUNO Just listening, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I think it is. 

00:25:30
MICHI MIZUNO Yeah. 

00:25:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I think they do. I think that the, I think, there's a conversation ... (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...between two people who are both trying to achieve the same thing... (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...which is to help that client lead a more satisfying life, and the, and that counselor is very much engaged... 

00:25:50
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...in wanting to help the counselor do that, and, and is perfectly willing to throw out ideas that might help, and ah, to make clear the process of career counseling that would engage that client in thinking in a different way. 

00:26:00
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. Okay. Because a lot of career counselors, ah, follow the theory of, more like, ah, Roger Rayon(ph) theory, that it is important to listen to the client? 

00:26:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Yes. 

00:26:10
MICHI MIZUNO  However, it seems your approach is rather, ah, influential to the client, more like active that's, that's, 

00:26:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I see. I see. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
MICHI MIZUNO that could be importantly. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, but, but at the same time, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
Listening actively is of crucial importance. 

00:26:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...Roger's notions about being a good listener... 

00:26:25
MICHI MIZUNO  Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...are important. 

00:26:30
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ You know, I think being a good listener is important, especially, ah, at the very beginning when you're trying to find out what is bothering the client. And so, so I, I, I don't wanna let you think that it was, ah, although I didn't spend very much time listening... 

00:26:45
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  because we had limited time when making this movie, ah,- 

00:26:50
Letting clients know they are being understood 

00:26:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - but, but, but it is important to make sure that you understand and that the client knows that you understand, that you, the, the counselor, understand what the, ah, client is feeling. 

00:27:05
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. Uh hmm. I see. Yes. I see. Yes. Uhm, how do you think the, uhm, in your opinion, how do you think the session went? Ah. 

00:27:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Well, considering the fact that we had a short amount of time, I thought it went very well. (laughs) 

00:27:20
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I thought Caroline was a wonderful client, and she, ah, explained what she was doing and, and it was, this was not a role-play, I mean I didn't know what she was gonna say. I didn't know what I was gonna say. 

00:27:30
Acknowledging that counselors can make mistakes too 

00:27:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  I might have made some mistakes, I probably did. Ah, and maybe when I see the movie, I'll say, "My gosh, John, you sure did a lousy job there," but, I don't know, I can't remember what it was that I made mistake right now. So, so, ah, I'm, ah, I'm okay with it. But, I, I thought it went well. 

00:27:50
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Ah, what do you think? 

00:27:50
MICHI MIZUNO Yeah, I think, uhm, it was, I think it, your approach empowered the clients a lot. 

00:27:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
MICHI MIZUNO  And because she was more sure of herself not making decision right now. 

00:28:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ It was okay for her not make a decision... (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
MICHI MIZUNO Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...right now? 

00:28:05
MICHI MIZUNO It was okay for her. 

00:28:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
MICHI MIZUNO And, uhm, I saw that change... 

00:28:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
MICHI MIZUNO ...in the client's face, and, yeah. 

00:28:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. 

00:28:15
MICHI MIZUNO Uhm, okay. Well, there are some questions from the members of JCDA. 

00:28:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. 

00:28:20
MICHI MIZUNO  And I would like to ask you some of the questions from that. 

00:28:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Sure. 

00:28:25
MICHI MIZUNO Ah, I learn in your book that although you promote Happenstance, you are now opposed to planning. How to recognize whether once you carefully make a plan ahead or take an action with the planned Happenstance attitude? 

00:28:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I see, see, I don't think that it is necessary to decide in advance, ah, or whether you make a plan... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...or whether you, whether you're gonna take some action. I mean, ah,- 

00:28:50
Doing what makes sense now 

00:28:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - I mean, these are, these are choices that you make, this is part of the happenstance approach, is that you do what's makes sense at the moment, okay. 

00:29:00
Planning the next step is perfectly OK 

00:29:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ So, ah, so, I have no objection to planning. I mean planning is great to do if you wanna do it. 

00:29:10
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Ah, the mistake- 

00:29:10
Not letting a prior plan dictate future actions 

00:29:10
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - is thinking that once you have made a plan that you must stick with it forever. 

00:29:15
MICHI MIZUNO  I see. 

00:29:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I mean that's the problem. Okay. So, so, if it makes you happy to make a plan, do it. 

00:29:25
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Go ahead, make a plan. Ah, and, and start, maybe following the plan. And then you say, "Whoa, wait a minute, ah, that's not working out the way I thought. I think maybe I better change my plan." Well, you can change your plan... 

00:29:35
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...or, you, or something might happen that shows you an opportunity that you never though about before... (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...and you say, "Wow, if I could just do that." Well, do it. 

00:29:45
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Try it. 

00:29:45
MICHI MIZUNO Uhm, the next question is, uhm, your Happenstance theor, learning theory is very popular in Japan, and many Japanese career counseling practitioners find it fascinating. I believe that book luck is no accident, tells us an importance to take an action. Now, the question is, what is your opinion on the importance of reflecting and adding meanings to, to the actions taken? In, uhm. 

00:30:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, I, I, I think that, yes- 

00:30:20
Reflecting and thinking about the consequences of actions are necessary 

00:30:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - you do want to think about... 

00:30:20
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...the actions that you're taking. You wanna think before you take the action... (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...you wanna think because it's the good thing to do, and, and while you're doing the action, you wanna think, "Hey, is this fun or not?" And after the action is over, you think, "Hmm, do I wanna do that again or do I wanna do something else?" So, so, yes, you're thinking about it all the time you're doing it. 

00:30:40
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ So, yes, I think you are reflecting and thinking about, and considering your actions in terms of a bigger, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ framework that you might have in your life as to what is making you happy and what making you satisfied, how it's affecting the other people in your life. So, yeah, you'll think about all those things. 

00:31:00
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ You don't just, you don't just go blindly... 

00:31:00
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:31:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...making one action after another... 

00:31:00
MICHI MIZUNO  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...without ever thinking about it... 

00:31:05
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...no, you, you think about it. 

00:31:05
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Sure. 

00:31:05
MICHI MIZUNO Uhm, this is the next, next question. Uhm, this is the question from the member, one of the members of... 

00:31:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. 

00:31:15
MICHI MIZUNO ...JCDA. 

00:31:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Okay. 

00:31:15
MICHI MIZUNO I am afraid that sometimes pla, Happenstance theory gives me a good excuse not to make decisions and avoid planning. How do you think about this? Okay? 

00:31:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, I think it's wrong. 

00:31:30
MICHI MIZUNO (laughs) Yes. 

00:31:30
Not waiting for a lucky break. 

00:31:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I think that, ah, the, ah, Happenstance approach is just the opposite... 

00:31:35
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ ...which is, that you don't wait for something to happen. You make it happen. 

00:31:40
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And you make it happen by trying things out. So you have to take some action. 

00:31:45
Trying out alternative actions without knowing their consequences 

00:31:45
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  And, you don't always know, in fact, you almost never know what the consequences of the every action are going to be. 

00:31:55
Needing actions to generate unexpected events 

00:31:55
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ You hope that it will be favorable, but you have to try it and see, okay? So, so the worst thing you can do- 

00:32:00
Participating, helping and talking with others 

00:32:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - is just to sit in your room, and, ah, play, ah, with your video games and, ah, and wait for the telephone to ring, where somebody offers you, ah, ah, ah, a very magnificent job. It will never happen that way. 

00:32:15
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  You gotta go out and you gotta be doing something and helping people, and, ah, showing your face and meeting people and talking to them about what you are interested in and what you're doing, and, and, ah,- 

00:32:30
Remaining alert to new opportunities 

00:32:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ - ah, and, and being alert to opportunities that you might be able take advantage of. 

00:32:35
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ  So, so, no. You don't just, ah, you just don't sit and do nothing. You have to be active all the time and alert to what might happen so that you can seize opportunities when they come along. 

00:32:50
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:32:50

00:33:10
CAROLINE LEE Uhm, it was a good experience, I think- 

00:33:10
Getting helpful feedback 

00:33:10

MICHI MIZUNO Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
CAROLINE LEE ...and concerns uhm, with the professional and to hear feedback about what I'm doing. And, uhm, I think it was helpful to,- 

00:33:25
Not needing to plan every future step 

00:33:25
CAROLINE LEE - to hear that. I don't need to plan out... 

00:33:30
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
CAROLINE LEE ...every single, uhm, you know, step in my life, although that's my inclination... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
CAROLINE LEE ...and I think the part of my personality. But it's good to hear that- 

00:33:35
Changing later is OK 

00:33:35
CAROLINE LEE  -I can take, you know, what, do the steps which I feel is beneficial for me right now. And later, if it doesn't turn out to be what I wanted to do long term, then, ah, it's okay that, uhm, I change and I could keep, uhm, using the skills that I learned... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
MICHI MIZUNO Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
CAROLINE LEE ...in a different profession as well. 

00:34:00
Getting reassurance that current actions will be helpful 

00:34:00
CAROLINE LEE So, I think it was good to hear that, uhm, I have, you know, various options and, it was also good to, to, to just hear reassurance that what I'm doing now... 

00:34:10
MICHI MIZUNO Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
CAROLINE LEE ...is a good step towards, you know, my future goals, and that I am, you know, doing, uhm, what I can now in developing, uhm, my future career.
