DR. ERIC GREEN Hi, I'm Doctor Eric Green, and welcome to my new DVD, Expressive Arts with Adolescents. I am a registered play therapist supervisor, a credential conferred by the association for play therapy, as well as a licensed professional counselor supervisor in Texas. I work full-time as an associate professor of counseling at the University of North Texas at Dallas, where I teach graduate courses and supervise students in clinical practice, in play therapy, and school counseling. I also maintain a part-time summer teaching schedule at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where I coordinate the annual Johns Hopkins Play Therapy Institute. I regularly present my research at the annual conferences for the Association for Play Therapy and the American Counseling Association. As well, I speak nationally, and now internationally, on the topic of expressive arts and Jungian play therapy. The professional role I am most drawn to is my clinical work with children, adolescents, and families. As the director of the UNT-Dallas counseling clinic, I see patients on a part-time basis, and supervise practicum students who use play therapy in expressive arts as their primary treatment modality with children and families. My disaster mental health work with traumatized children, which integrates the use of play and expressive arts has been featured in an hour-long CNN cable television news documentary titled, "Children of the Storm." I am the co-editor of "Integrating Expressive Arts and Play Therapy with Children and Adolescents," and the author of "The Handbook of Jungian Play Therapy with Children and Adolescents." In the summer of 2013, I also released my very first DVD with Alexander Street Press, "Jungian Play Therapy, and Sandplay with Children." This video provides an overview of select essential disciplines of the expressive arts with adolescents within the mental health paradigm of care, as well as the process practitioners can follow to competently incorporate expressive art interventions, with adolescents, into their clinical practice. The basic assumption underlying the use of expressive arts with adolescents is that adolescents may find the less verbal means of communication and creative self expression, from multiple creative modalities that are developmentally sensitive, to be beneficial. In other words, the use of expressive arts, such as music, drawing, sand, and play, may facilitate a curative path for the adolescent that engenders honest and open communication, engaged in, and at, the adolescent's time, pacing, and choice. This video will briefly describe and demonstrate interventions from four major expressive art disciplines: Music, play, sandplay, and art or drawings. When considering the implantation of expressive arts with adolescents, a clinician should be familiarized with the typical settings, situations, and materials generally needed to competently execute the interventions. The typical settings clinicians may utilize expressive arts with adolescents include: Private practice work, outpatient and inpatient treatment settings, community counseling agencies, secondary schools, and disaster mental health work. The clinical situations vary in scope and depth, and not all adolescents will be amenable to, or develop a liking for, the expressive arts. It is up to the clinician and adolescent to collaboratively work together to determine what is the most effective means of communication and relationship building within the therapeutic dyad. The typical situation that expressive arts may be most effective are with adolescents affected by interpersonal abuse, bullying, traumatic violence, depression, anxiety, inter-familial trauma, complex trauma, learning disabilities, and bereavement. The materials needed to implement expressive arts depend upon the modality. For this video, sandplay, play therapy, music, and art or drawings, are used. For sandplay: Sand, a sand tray, and a diverse, robust collection of sand miniatures, including those that capture various religious, cultural, and trans-cultural symbols should be used. Play therapy and music therapy with adolescents may include board games, an electronic tablet, laptop, or PC with internet access to view appropriate videos. Music, art, playing cards, play-based activities such as ping pong, Frisbee, badminton, Jenga, and assorted art activities. Art therapy may include supplies such as construction paper, multicolored pencils, markers and crayons, paintbrushes, paint, yarn, glue, scissors, paper, glitter, molding clay, and stickers. This next portion of the video will define and show the research support for the major expressive art disciplines highlighted in this video, including art or drawings, play therapy, sandplay, and music therapy. First up, we have drawings or art. Art is any type of creativity that is produced uniquely by an adolescent and is considered a valid form of self expression and intercommunication. Art or drawings include various types of media, including abstract paintings, collages, drawings on paper, and various other types of self expression that fall under the rubric of creativity. Art is individualistic, and, therefore, is not judged by the therapist as right, or wrong, or good, or bad. All art that adolescents produce is viewed as valued and of meaning, as it comes from within the adolescent and is an expression outward. The research to support art therapy and drawings demonstrates that creative self expression in the company of a non-judgmental, caring therapist, promotes self healing in adolescents, as well as increases self worth and improved self acceptance. Second, we have play therapy. While play therapy is traditionally used with younger children, play-based activities often work well with adolescents, especially if they are developmentally sensitive and are chosen by the adolescent freely. Play therapy is the use of toys and activities as a form of symbolic expression of an individual's inner experience. Through play, where toys or activities represent interior dialogue, and play represents the language, an adolescent is able to engage in an expressive form of interaction with the therapist to either communicate, self express, or externalize difficult feelings or cognitions in a less threatening mechanism that strict verbalizations alone may incur. Third, we have sandplay. Sandplay is a nonverbal, kinesthetic, expressive art intervention that utilizes sand, a sand tray, and sand miniatures, to create sand pictures by the adolescent. This modality was initially created by Dora Kalff, who was appointed by Doctor Carl Jung to study with Margaret Lowenfeld, and generate a Jungian version, or modality, of Lowenfeldian sandplay work that epitomized what Jung referred to as the concretization of active imagination. Through the calming engagement that occurs with touching and manipulating sand, adolescents are able to communicate inner longings and unconscious drives that are sometimes repressed, or unavailable to the conscious, waking ego. Through the externalization of the projection in the sand tray, adolescents are often able to make meaningful connections between their inner and outer polarities of the effective and cognitive states of their well being. Research demonstrates that in sandplay with adolescents, anxiety can be reduced, communication skills may be increased, creativity is provided a safe outlet, self healing is worked through and promoted regarding issues related to grief, and loss. Also, sandplay assists the psyche with ordering and arrangement so that meaningful connections are made from the interior, toward the outerior, and back again. Therefore, a psychological congruence occurs that may increase self awareness and assist the adolescent with emotional containment. The step-by-step instructions to conduct sandplay are quite complex, and require many years of sandplay-specific training, and supervision by certified teaching members within the Sandplay Therapists of America, or the International Society of Sandplay Therapists. Therapists must complete a lengthy study of archetypal symbols, and have a nuanced understanding of the sandplay process by participating, and completing in their own sandplay process with a certified teaching member in addition to writing multiple papers and receiving consultation and supervision. Finally, we have music. The use of music as an expressive art therapy provides the adolescent with the opportunity to relate to, co-participate in, listen to, and interpret lyrics of songs and melodies in an effort at self healing through musical connection. There are various types of music therapy interventions available, as well as professional graduate training programs available here in the U.S. Music is another form of an expressive art that should only be used, as with the other expressive art intervention described in this video, with the proper education, supervision of clinical practice, and credentials, before incorporating into anyone's clinical work. The research demonstrates that music, in expressive arts therapy, may benefit adolescents by decreasing anxiety, releasing blocked affect through the engagement of personally meaningful melodies and substantive lyrics, and facilitating the formation of advanced self identity, as well as increasing feelings of self worth. Next, we have the role of the therapist, and that role, which we see in the expressive art intervention and implementation of. The role of the expressive arts therapist, when implementing expressive arts with adolescents, is to engage from the humanistic paradigm which comprises unconditional positive regard, non-judgmentalism, and acceptance. The therapist becomes a silent but supportive observer by facilitating the path through providing various and creative media for adolescents to self express and communicate at their own pace and their own design. The therapist recognizes that the undergirding to all expressive arts media is the honoring and activation of the adolescent's imaginal capacity. In other words, the therapist creates a free and protected space in the consulting room by integrating expressive arts so that adolescents feel psychologically safe to self express, if they choose, by engaging with their imagination, and externalizing that unique creativity outward, where it is met, by a therapist, with acceptance and unconditional encouragement. The next aspect of expressive arts, and the implementation of those with adolescents, is the concept and term of creativity in counseling, and meeting adolescents developmentally. The role of creativity is substantial in expressive arts, as therapists recognize the healing qualities imbued with the transmission of deep, sometimes hidden, fears, longings, murderous desires, affections, regrets, uncontrollable romantic longings, and intense happiness, that vacillate often during the adolescent development. Creativity, provided by the engagements with expressive arts, affords the adolescent an opportunity to take risks in the consulting room that are met with acceptance by a caring, trained, adult therapist. Through this acceptance, adolescents begin to develop a sense of increased self worth and self acceptance within the inner subjective field, that is often carried over, or, in other words, externalized into their other familial and peer-based social relationships. It is within families and social relationships with peers that adolescents most often indicate disaffection, disillusionment, and alienation, because those around them, often, in their opinions, do not trust, or maybe do not understand them. Therefore, meeting adolescents developmentally, through the use of playful activities and expressive arts, may increase feelings of contentment in the adolescent, and may improve social relationships for the adolescent at their home and at their school environment. Ultimately, this developmentally appropriate, therapeutic mode of care, is recognize by some adolescents as a mechanism of safe self expression through creativity, and this skill, and reliance upon the imaginal capacity, or imagination, to resolve psycho-social difficulties, is continued on long after therapy terminates. The next part of this process is looking at credentialing and ethical considerations. For the specific credentialing process and the ethics involved within each of the four essential expressive art therapeutic modalities outlined in this video, are any of the other major expressive therapies. Please refer to my newly published, co-edited book, "Integrating Expressive Arts with Adolescents," or feel free to visit the respective websites for each of the nationally or internationally recognized accreditation bodies correlated with a specific expressive modality. For example, those viewers interested in sandplay would want to visit the Sandplay Therapist of America or the International Society of Sandplay Therapist websites for more information about the credentialing process to become a certified sandplay therapist. Similarly, for those interested in play therapy, viewers would find the Association for Play Therapy helpful in understanding the steps to becoming a registered play therapist. In this video clip, I will be working with Angel to demonstrate how the coloring of mandalas, circular shapes with intricate designs, promote relaxation and assist the adolescent psyche in coordination and self regulation of affect and impulse. To execute the coloring mandala intervention, the therapist must first engage in two to three minutes of deep breathing and relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation, to decrease potential hyper-arousal, and increase a sense of calmness, and cognitive clarity. Next, the therapist must have several pre-designed mandalas available for the adolescent to choose from. These may be procured, at no cost, by exploring the internet or by purchasing a workbook specifically containing diverse mandala prints. After the adolescent chooses the mandala to color, the therapist then asks the adolescent to color the mandala while the therapist sits in silence and observes. The therapist may ask if the adolescent is okay with soft or relaxing music being played in the background during the activity; if so, the therapist can simply use a laptop, or an iPad, and navigate to YouTube to find relaxation tunes at no charge, or they may visit my website at www.DrEricGreen.com, where there is a repository of free relaxation tunes from which therapists may choose. The therapist does not verbalize, or initiate conversation while the adolescent is coloring the mandala, but remains a silent, supportive observer. After the adolescent completes the mandala, the therapist asks the adolescent to write the story of the mandala on that back of the paper, or the palm of the mandala. The story of the mandala is whatever the adolescent sees when looking at the drawing. Also, the adolescent may identify the colors in the mandala, and possibly create a color map depicting what each color means to him or her. There is no right or wrong answer. Also, the therapist does not interpret the drawing, or analyze it in front of the adolescent, but ask, instead, the adolescent, 'is there anything you'd like to share about your mandala?' Afterward, the therapist places the mandala in the adolescent's folder, and keeps the image contained to maintain the free and protected space, facilitated within the consulting room that's free from judgments and protected from intrusions. In this next clip, Angel and I will demonstrate an original, play-based activity that integrates art called "create your cultural collage." In this expressive intervention, therapists first want to take a couple of minutes to engage in progressive muscle relaxation with the adolescent, and or deep breathing, to decrease the autonomic nervous system, and increase the capacity of the psyche to express itself more freely. Next, the therapist provides various art materials for the adolescent to utilize, such as construction paper, scissors, glue, magazines, a laptop to locate images that represent the adolescent's culture, glitter, glitter glue, crayons, markers. The therapist initiates a conversation with the adolescent on what their individual identity signifies, and how it correlates to different cultural variables such as religion, family tradition, sexual orientation, gender, race, age. Next, the adolescent is provided the opportunity to search for images that they believe represent their self identity, and that of the cultural variables in which they identify with. These images may be obtained through magazines, or by use of the Internet. After the images are procures, the adolescent is then asked to create a collage with the images, on the construction paper, by gluing the images and adding any additional creative ideas they have to the collage. As the adolescent is creating the collage, the therapist may ask if the adolescent is okay with soft relaxation music being played in the background. When the adolescent is finished, the therapist asks the adolescent to write the story of their collage on the back of the construction paper, and to include their name somewhere in the collage. After, the therapist then asks the adolescent, 'is there anything you would like to share about your collage? There is no right or wrong way to share, and it's completely up to you.' Instead of the therapist focusing on specific, or directive interventions, like questions, the therapist may, instead, want to listen intently and make empathic or reflective statements to encourage and support the adolescent in their creative endeavor. In this next clip, I demonstrate the steps to execute sandplay with the caveat that this intervention should only be utilized by those therapists who have the necessary and appropriate credentials. First, the adolescent is asked to create a sand picture. The therapist sits quietly as the adolescent engages in the sandplay process by inserting sand miniatures into the sand tray to formulate a sand picture. Afterward, the therapist may simply ask, 'is there anything you'd like to share about your sand picture?' No additional directive questions are typically asked by a therapist, nor are there any interpretations or analysis verbally done to the adolescent, or about the adolescent, at any time, by the therapist, regarding the sand picture. The therapist contains the sand picture by observing it and honoring it through silent acceptance. Afterward, the therapist takes a picture of the sand creation or image. After the adolescent leaves the consulting room, the therapist then places the sand miniatures back on the shelf. The adolescent does not co-participate or observe this activity as to honor the free and protected space. According to Dora Kelff, the originator of Jungian sandplay therapy, the free and protected space is the most essential underlying element of the sandplay process, so that clients may feel free, and unencumbered, to self express. In this clip, I work with McKinzie, a 15-year-old female, to demonstrate an original music therapy intervention titled, "a song for you." First, the therapist asks the adolescent to engage in two to three minutes of deep breathing and relaxation. Next, the therapist asks the adolescent to search through YouTube, or their iPod, to identify a current, or recent, song that has some substantive value to them. Specifically, the therapist instructs the adolescent to pick a song that they most closely identify with, or that represents who they are, or how they feel. The adolescent is asked to search for the lyrics as well, and, if possible, to bring in a copy to the session. Afterward, the therapist and the adolescent, if the adolescent chooses, listen to the song together, and then read the lyrics together. The therapist may ask the adolescent, 'what would you like for me to know about this song, and about you, from this activity?' There is no analysis made, or interpretation offered, by the therapist. After, the therapist may ask the adolescent if he or she would like to write any new lyrics to the song, or an entirely new song, that they believe represents who they are and how they feel, or maybe a poem, or maybe an image. The therapist then asks the adolescent to share the newly created song, or poem, or verse, or image, and afterward, the adolescent is encouraged for their effort, and self expression to the music is acknowledged and appreciated. In this video, I have provided a cursory overview of some of the expressive art therapies that may be practiced with adolescents in mental healthcare settings. Also, I discussed the salience and importance of seeking additional training and credentialing in these specific expressive art areas, such as sandplay, art therapy, music therapy, and play therapy, as well as the importance of ethics and competence when integrating expressive media into play-based psychotherapy with teenagers. Then, we viewed clinical sessions with two adolescents, McKinzie and Angel, who were engaged in various expressive are interventions which allowed for self expression, developmentally appropriate symbolic communication, and creative or imaginative freedom. Finally, in this last section, I will address cross-disciplinary core competency issues. One of the core reasons this video was created was to underscore the attention to, and mindfulness required, by child-based clinicians when practicing outside one's training and scope of practice. Clinicians are encouraged to address cross-disciplinary core competency issues while competently applying expressive arts and techniques to further enhance their treatment with adolescents. The viewer is urged to seek outside supervision regarding use of applications from disciplines beyond their training. Also, this video is by no means a substitute for what constitutes best practices when learning new areas within the field of mental health counseling. These areas would include formal education and training, supervised practice, and critical reflectivity; in other words, therapist-initiated inner work. The significance of engaging in ongoing reflectivity in our archetypal role as the wounded healer expands our collective awareness and calls us to be responsible, progressive, and endlessly curious. The childlike spirit in us calls us to forego complacent behaviors, and to seek new aspects of our field, new paradigms validated by research, and new paths to take that may lead us to understandings of ourselves and our patients that could deepen our work with them. In conclusion, I hope that you, the viewer, will find comfort and creativity from watching this video, and that it will enrich your child mental health treatment protocols. Last, I want to honor the paths already illuminated by those who have paved the way before, in these rich, beautiful traditions of helping others self-heal through creative media. Sandra Graves-Alcorn, Barry Cohen, Judy Rubin, Cathy Malchiodi, Eliana Gil, Eleanor Irwin, Rie Rogers Mitchell, Harriet Friedman, Shaun McNiff, and all of those expressive art, sand, and play pioneers who brilliantly laid the path for us all to engage in this beneficial treatment paradigm. May all of your work become more interdisciplinary and inclusive, and thank you for viewing this video, I hope it deepens your work with adolescents and their families.

Expressive Arts Intervention "A Song For You" With McKinzie 

00:30:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Hi, McKinzie. 

00:30:05
MCKINZIE Hi, Dr. Green. 

00:30:05
DR. ERIC GREEN It's good to see you, thank you for being here. So, today, we're going to, um, in our session, talk a little bit about, and practice, something called a music intervention, and it's a technique that I've created called, "a song for you," and we talked a little bit about it last time we met, and, um, basically, just to remind you, music therapy, or music interventions, are one way that teenagers, like yourself, can use music and melody and lyrics to express themselves, um, to maybe show different parts of themselves that might be otherwise hard to say verbally, to an adult, if maybe they have worries, or maybe strains, or relational sh-, relational problems with their peers, or things like that. And so, one thing that we do in, um, psychotherapy, is something called expressive arts, and one of the expressive arts, to express ourselves, is music. And I understand you like music quite a bit. 

00:31:10
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:31:10
DR. ERIC GREEN What kind of music do you like? 

00:31:10
MCKINZIE Um, it ranges, like, R&B, pop, basically everything except for country music, really. 

00:31:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Ah, I see. So, country music is sort of something you probably stay away from? 

00:31:20
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:31:20
DR. ERIC GREEN So, you brought a country song today? No. You didn't bring... 

00:31:25
MCKINZIE No. 

00:31:25
DR. ERIC GREEN ...okay. Um, so, what song did you bring in today? Could... 

00:31:30
MCKINZIE Um, "Happy," by Pharrell Williams. 

00:31:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. All right. And you, I see you brought the lyrics, like I asked you to, thank you for putting the effort into doing that. Um, so, um, what I'll do is, I'm, we're going to play the song "Happy" in, uh, from my laptop, on YouTube, but before we do that, I wanted to see if you wouldn't, maybe, mind sharing a little bit about what it is about this song that resonates with you, um, and maybe what brought you to choose it and bring it in today? 

00:32:00
MCKINZIE Well, I believe that, as a person, I'm majorily happy. Of course, everyone has their ups and downs, but I'm a very happy person. I'd rather be happy than anything else, so that's what really tied me to the song. 

00:32:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. So, happiness is something that's really important to you right now. 

00:32:20
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:32:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Tell me how you define happiness. 

00:32:20
MCKINZIE I believe happiness, it, it doesn't have a definition. 

00:32:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:32:25
MCKINZIE Everyone has their own thoughts and feelings about everything in the world, and happiness, to me, is just not necessarily being around people that make you feel a certain way, it's all the things that happen in your life that actually makes you feel better about yourself, and everything that's happening. 

00:32:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. Are there any people in your life that make, help you feel better about yourself and what's happening around you? 

00:32:45
MCKINZIE Almost everyone in my family. My, my mom, my dad, my brothers, well, of course, my friends. 

00:32:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:32:55
MCKINZIE Just everyone. 

00:32:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Uh, my last question before we listen, do you have any memories associated with this song? Have you every, ever played it for your friends, or have you heard it at your school, or with, have you seen it on TV, or anything, or in a movie, or... 

00:33:10
MCKINZIE It constantly comes on, on the radio, and I believe it was on Despicable Me Two. 

00:33:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Oh, uh, and that's a movie that I've seen, and really enjoyed. Uh, and you've seen it, obviously, too. 

00:33:20
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:33:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay, so that's something we have in common. All right, so, um, if you don't mind, we're going to, uh, go ahead and play Happy, okay? 

00:33:25
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:33:25
DR. ERIC GREEN And we'll listen to it, and while we're listening, if you want to, I'll pretty much be quiet, but if you'd like to add anything, or if you want me to pause, and share something. If not, we'll listen to it, and while we're listening to it, I'm going to be listening for, to the melody, and to the lyrics, and I see you brought the lyrics. Do you mind if we place it in between us? 

00:33:45
MCKINZIE No. 

00:33:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Um, and, usually, if you don't mind, I usually ask, um, whoever I'm, um, doing this activity with, if there's a part of the song that you like the most, before we play it, you can, if you want to read it out loud, is there a line that you like? Or... 

00:34:05
MCKINZIE Um, on verse two, when he's like, 'here comes bad news, talking this and that, well give, well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back, I should probably warn you, I'll be just fine, no offense to you, don't waste your time.' 

00:34:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Thank you for pointing that out, and when we hear it I'll definitely be thinking of you, and, so, here we go. Um, uh, let's see. 

00:34:30
[music] 

00:35:15
DR. ERIC GREEN That was a character... 

00:35:15
MCKINZIE From this movie. 

00:35:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. That's your part, that's the part you like. 

00:35:25
MCKINZIE Yep. 

00:35:30
[music] 

00:35:55
DR. ERIC GREEN I can do that. 

00:36:00
[music] 

00:36:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Is that Magic Johnson? The other one? And that one's Kelly Osbourne, huh? 

00:36:05
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:36:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Oh. 

00:36:10
MCKINZIE I noticed there was a lot of famous people in here. 

00:36:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. Everyone's, like, happy and dancing. 

00:36:20
[music] 

00:36:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Wow. Thank you for listening to that song with me. And, um, so, um, I guess the first part of this intervention, now that we've heard the song, uh, for us to kind of communicate to each other, is how are you feeling that we've heard the song together? Or, are you feeling anything? That the... 

00:36:50
MCKINZIE No. I don't. I feel we're on a better connection level, I guess. 

00:36:50
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh-huh. Yeah, because it was just, uh, what, making us both, I noticed we were both kind of tapping our hands, and kind of swaying a little, and it was happy. 

00:37:00
MCKINZIE And connecting when we saw the people we knew on there. 

00:37:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Sure. Okay, so, that, that was, that was sort of, like, helping us socially connect, and feel like we're on the, us, the same level, and getting pieces together. Um, so, let's look at the lyrics for a second. Um, if, um, this is the chorus, so this is the verse that you were talking about, this is the chorus. 

00:37:25
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:37:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, would you like to read any other parts of the song? I was kind of reading as we went along, and I've heard this song as well, and I'm so happy that you brought it in today. Um. 

00:37:40
MCKINZIE Um, no, I'm pretty much, like, I like this song in general, but it's just that verse (inaudible ). 

00:37:50
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. All right, so, McKinzie, the next part of this, and remember, this is all voluntary, you don't have to do anything if you don't want to, it's up to you. Um, if you could think of the feeling that we just had watching this song together, listening to the melody, or the chorus, or watching Pharrell dance, and whatever aspect, or the lyrics that you want to focus on, I wanted to give you a couple of options. Would you like to do a drawing to either abstract, or a painting, to kind of symbolize some feeling, or some part of your identity from this song? Would you like to, maybe, write a poem about something that inspired you from this song? Or, the third option is you could write different lyrics to make them specific to you, if you'd like. 

00:38:40
MCKINZIE Um, I, I'd like to write a poem. 

00:38:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. A poem. Okay, great. Um, I'm just going to sit here quietly, and take your time, there's no right or wrong way, and whenever you're done, let me know. 

00:38:50
MCKINZIE Okay. 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:39:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay, so, McKinzie, um, you were asking me a question about the video. You said you saw a couple of, tell me what you were saying. 

00:39:05
MCKINZIE Oh, I saw a couple of, like, other people that I listen to in the music video. 

00:39:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Do you want to share who they were? Or (inaudible ). 

00:39:15
MCKINZIE Um, it was Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, and, like, another person, like, they're in this group called Odd Future, but, yeah. 

00:39:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. And, they, they have, like, songs out right now? And they, and... 

00:39:25
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:39:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Uh, what kind of music is it? 

00:39:25
MCKINZIE It's, it's more rap music. It's... 

00:39:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh-huh. 

00:39:30
MCKINZIE ...it's different. I don't know. It's more the music where you want to be yourself, type. It's, but it's inappropriate. 

00:39:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Oh, okay. So it's something that, maybe, you weren't quite comfortable... 

00:39:40
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:39:40
DR. ERIC GREEN ...bringing in today. Okay, that makes sense. So you wanted to, you still feel like you can be yourself, but you also re-, recognize when things were reflective of you, and which you like, and what, maybe, other people may judge you by, or just... 

00:39:55
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:39:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. All right, so, uh, thank you for sharing that with me. And I see that you wrote a poem. Um, um, is there anything about it you'd like to share? 

00:40:05
MCKINZIE Um, basically, it was sort of my view of ha-, uh, happiness. 

00:40:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. 

00:40:10
MCKINZIE You want me to read it? 

00:40:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Sure. That would be, that, that would be great. Thank you. 

00:40:15
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. I said, what is happiness when your life is bored of the crappiness? All of your family, and all of your friends, with them, you'll have no worries to the end. Your feelings and emotions will be true, no one could ever tell you how to be you. 

00:40:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm. Wow. Thank you. Uh, I really appreciate the, the level of thought and, the, the craft of the poem. To me it, it really, um, underlines what you've been saying all along today, in our session, which is, happiness, and the communication of that, is something that comes from within you, and that, um, that's something very important, and very valuable, to you, and you're not going to let anyone change that, because that's a part of who you are. 

00:41:05
MCKINZIE Yes. At, like, at the begin, at the beginning, I wasn't really confident in myself, and as I've grown older I've noticed that not everyone is going to accept you for who you are, so you might as well be what you want to be. 

00:41:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. And, to me, that just really captures what happiness is, in a nutshell, is being what you want to be, and who you are. Um, and, is there anything else you want to share about yourself, as it relates to happiness, um, before we end this activity? 

00:41:30
MCKINZIE Mm, no. 

00:41:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Yeah? 

00:41:35
MCKINZIE I'm pretty content. 

00:41:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Um, I have an idea; do you want to, maybe, um, play the, of, as we're finishing the session, play the song, and then maybe, if we get inspired, we can get up and dance? 

00:41:45
MCKINZIE Okay. 

00:41:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Cool. All right. Thank you. In this session, McKinzie and I engaged in music therapy intervention titled, "a song for you." As you saw, McKinzie brought in the song, "Happy," by Pharrell. She indicated it was from the movie Despicable Two. There were several interesting things that I learned from her, and about our relationship that was, as it was newly forming, from this experience. First, she felt a sense of connection to the words, "well, give me all you got, and don't hold back, well, I should probably warn you, I'll be just fine, no offense to you, don't want to waste your time." Even though she pointed out that this was the most significant portion of this song, I saw a parallel process occurring between us and these lyrics, as the session progressed. She became more and more comfortable, as evidenced by her indication that she saw other people in the video that she recognized, and appreciated their music, and that I recognized different people in the video that she recognized as well. This forged a commonality between me and the adolescent which served as a transitional space, or a bridge, so that anxiety could be slightly decreased, and communication, and the self-care model of sharing ourselves, or parts of ourselves, with someone else, was honored, and sacred. At the end, McKinzie wrote a poem called, "What is Happiness?" Again, McKinzie talked about the feeling of happiness. In fact, she said happiness cannot be defined, she said it's something you feel, you know, from those around you. While expressive arts therapists do not analyze or interpret individual artwork or single pieces of creativity by children, what I did learn from McKinzie, from this poem, was that those around her, her support system, where she derives her coping skills from, is extremely important to her. It supports her, it enriches her, it embellishes her, and it helps her thrive. Afterwards, we both, uh, put the song back on, and I even made the comment, you know, if we want to start dancing, we can dance, and we did. We danced together through this music therapy intervention, which increased communication, it enhanced her feelings of connection to me as a caring adult, and it gave me a glimpse into this child's inner world of happiness and joy.

Expressive Arts Intervention "Create Your Cultural Collage" With McKinzie 

00:45:00
[music] 

00:45:05
DR. ERIC GREEN McKinzie, the next activity we're going to practice is the expressive art intervention, uh, called, "create your cultural collage." Have you ever done a collage before? 

00:45:15
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:45:15
DR. ERIC GREEN You have? Okay. So, as I explained to you, um, earlier, this activity will be when you go through magazines, um, my computer, if you want to use my laptop, and find images of different parts of your culture, or identity. Um, and when you hear the word culture, what do you think of? 

00:45:35
MCKINZIE I think of all the things that come together to make up a specific place... 

00:45:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:45:40
MCKINZIE ...people... 

00:45:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:45:40
MCKINZIE ...different things. 

00:45:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Right, so it could be like, speaking of specific places and people, it could be food that we eat, it could be, um, the Church, maybe, we attend, the religious... 

00:45:50
MCKINZIE The clothing... 

00:45:50
DR. ERIC GREEN The clothing we wear... 

00:45:50
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:45:55
DR. ERIC GREEN ...the way we speak... 

00:45:55
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:45:55
DR. ERIC GREEN ...the geograph-, geographic place where we live. Okay, so you've got the idea of culture. And, and, the reason why I do this, uh, activity with, uh, teenagers, is because, um, sometimes expressing yourself, and parts of who you are, is hard to do just verbally. So, this is a mechanism that's, maybe, a little bit safer, that you can do it symbolically with pictures and it helps us get to know each other, and for me to, to see the beautiful parts of who you are beyond just what we see on the outside. Does that make sense? 

00:46:25
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:46:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, um, you have several magazines, there. Whenever you're ready, why don't you flip through and find, let's say, ten images. If you want more, that's fine, take your time. And then, um, if you could glue them onto the paper, and create a collage, and then, maybe, write your name? Incorporate it somewhere? 

00:46:45
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:46:45
DR. ERIC GREEN All right. And, um, if you want, I can, um, play some relaxation music, while you're doing this, or we can be in silence. It's up to you. 

00:46:50
MCKINZIE Okay. Um, I'd like silence. 

00:46:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Okay, great. 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay, McKinzie, it looks as you're finished your cultural collage. 

00:47:30
MCKINZIE Yes, Doctor Green. 

00:47:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Um, is there anything you'd like to share about your collage with me? 

00:47:35
MCKINZIE Um, I think it really represents me... 

00:47:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:47:40
MCKINZIE ...the things I like about myself. 

00:47:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. Do you want to tell me a little bit about what parts of it remind you of yourself? And... 

00:47:45
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
DR. ERIC GREEN ...If you'd mind, watch, I might just turn it a little bit this way so I can look at it with you... 

00:47:50
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:47:50
DR. ERIC GREEN ...and honor your image with you? 

00:47:55
MCKINZIE Mm-hmm. 

00:47:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Thank you. 

00:47:55
MCKINZIE Okay. Um, in this picture, you see she is holding a microphone. 

00:47:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh-huh. 

00:47:55
MCKINZIE I really like to sing. 

00:48:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Oh. 

00:48:00
MCKINZIE And, actually, my middle name is Danielle. And, I think the words that I chose to put on here are really the ones that are kind of mantras, to me. 

00:48:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:48:10
MCKINZIE In, love your skin, confidence, stop freaking out, I have to tell myself to start calming down, and coming back down to Earth when things seem to get crazy in my life. 

00:48:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:48:25
MCKINZIE I know I'm crazy. I'm a very cool person, very chill type. I like to cook, actually. Um, I love my smile; I almost laugh at everything. You can say one word, and I'll just start laughing. 

00:48:40
DR. ERIC GREEN I noticed that to, I noticed that today, in our session, you've been, just, very happy, and laughing, and I was happy to see that you're in a good space, today. 

00:48:45
MCKINZIE And then fashion; I love fashion. Um, I really like the jacket. I like the colors, and the patterns, and then the shirt. Maybe if it was longer, I don't really like showing my body. 

00:48:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:48:55
MCKINZIE Um, I love clothes. I could go, I could be in a mall all day. Shop 'till I drop, literally. 

00:49:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh-huh. 

00:49:05
MCKINZIE And, love; actually, joy, peace, and love are the things that I hope to have in my life as I grow older. 

00:49:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:49:15
MCKINZIE Just, to finally be happy with everything that's going on. 

00:49:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:49:20
MCKINZIE And then, right there, that's where I signed I my name, and I put it in red because red is one of my favorite colors. I actually have five favorite colors, which are red, blue, purple, yellow, and black. 

00:49:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Red, blue, purple, yellow, and black. 

00:49:35
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:49:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. All right. Um, so, uh, thank you for sharing, and thank you for connecting the images with specific parts of who you are. Um, I really appreciate that, and it's certainly given me an im-, a, an image, glimpse, sort of, of, kind of, parts of yourself that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to know just by talking to you. Like the singing part, so I might ask you to sing a song at the end of our session, if you, or sing a part, if you want. But, um, I do have one other question for you, um, before we, uh, finish with our intervention, and then you can certainly ask any questions you have. It is: are there any parts of this that you can directly link to the, maybe, where you live, or your age group, or being a female, or, or the way that your, uh, your family cooks, or, or, family traditions, is there things that you want to link directly to your culture for me, to help me understand? 

00:50:25
MCKINZIE I believe that the types of fashion that I put on here really direct towards my age group, you know... 

00:50:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:30
MCKINZIE ...I'm 15, so, I believe that I'm still in the, 'ooh, that's just cute, that's so cute,' I'm still in that stage, not as to which, 'oh, I could probably wear that when I go to this place, or that place.' 

00:50:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:45
MCKINZIE I'm not really thinking about where I'm going to go. 

00:50:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, thank you, and, um, would you like to write a poem? So, it sounds like there's clothes on here, and there's a culture of youth that you really identify with, that you wanted me to know a part of it is important to you. 

00:51:00
MCKINZIE Yes. 

00:51:00
DR. ERIC GREEN And that's where you are. Okay. Is there a poem, uh, the last part of this, and it's totally voluntary, you don't have to do, is there a poem, or a story, you want to write about your collage, on the back? 

00:51:15
MCKINZIE Um, no thank you, Doctor Green, I believe that I really sh-, shew-, showed, uh, I, I messed up the word. 

00:51:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:51:25
MCKINZIE Um. 

00:51:25
DR. ERIC GREEN So, you, you, you showed me... 

00:51:25
MCKINZIE I've shown. 

00:51:25
DR. ERIC GREEN That you go, we got... 

00:51:25
MCKINZIE I've shown. 

00:51:25
DR. ERIC GREEN We got it together. Okay. 

00:51:30
MCKINZIE Myself really well. 

00:51:30
DR. ERIC GREEN (inaudible ). 

00:51:35
MCKINZIE I'm sorry, I'm a big goofy, but, um. 

00:51:35
DR. ERIC GREEN I like that about you. I, that's something else we have in common, so, you showed yourself well, and I agree with you. Thank you so much for your time, and your effort into this. It's been a pleasure. 

00:51:45
MCKINZIE Okay. Thank you. 

00:51:50
DR. ERIC GREEN You're welcome. In this session, McKinzie and I engaged in an original expressive art therapy technique titled, "create your cultural collage." McKinzie chose several different images depicting various creations in the collage that signified parts of herself, her familial traditions, her age group, and her specific geographical culture. One of the things that really stood out to me was the liveliness and, um, vibrance, of the images. Most of them are bright, and warm, and expressed feelings of happiness, sort of integrating from previous, um, information, that she disclosed, in the music therapy intervention. Also, she described certain, um, I think the word she used was mantras such as, love your skin, confident, radiant. She even talked about how she was crazy, not in a mental health deficiency way, but, I took it as a carefree way, and as a lust for life, a zest for living, a vitality, a youthful energy, that she was proud to acknowledge, and wanted to share with me during the session. As I summarized the "create your cultural collage" activity with McKinzie, I think about, what did I learn from her? And what did I learn about myself, and our relationship, and the space between us? What I learned about McKinzie, from this activity, was that she is very much clear about the things that she likes, and how they relate to how others view her, and see her, in the context of her developmental epic. Second, I appreciated the way that she disclosed that she was a singer, when she pointed to the microphone, to the young girl, uh, and said that her middle name was Danielle, which was the name on the collage. She shared something that, maybe, she would not have shared had we just been talking verbally. So, here we see evidence that the symbolic interaction created a meta-communication, or meta-cognition, between us, that allowed her to share, maybe private, or maybe parts of herself, that she's not so willing to disclose with someone who she barely knows. Finally, what did I learn about myself, and the relationship between us, and the space between us, from this activity? I learned that she felt safe not only sharing things with me, but also had a bit of security going beneath the images in sharing some of her desires, and fantasies, that were invoked by the images. She talked about beauty, she talked about eyes, she talked about clothes; these are all things that are very important to her, and, therefore, were very important for me to listen to, non-judgmentally, and accept her for where was, and who she is, without trying to change where she is, or who she was.

Expressive Arts Intervention "Create Your Cultural Collage" With Angel 

00:55:25
DR. ERIC GREEN So, Hi, Angel. 

00:55:25
ANGEL Hi. 

00:55:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Hi. Thank you for being here today. Uh, you're welcome. Uh, uh, I wanted us to start out with, kind of, a way to, uh, get to know each other a little bit, and some of the ways that I do that with other teenagers that I work with is I do something called expressive arts. Um, and all ex-, that word means is that we kind of find things like music, um, art, sand, different, da-, types of artistic ways to help us create, or self express. And even if you're not artistic, which, I'm not very artistic, there's no right or wrong way to do it, it's just really up to you. The way I see it is that it's beautiful, because it comes from within you, so it's from you. So, there's no right, or wrong, way. Okay? Um, so, I think to start we're going to try this, uh, technique I've created called create your cultural collage. Um, and, basically, what this is, is it's a way for us to communicate different parts of yourself, different parts of your culture. Angel, when you think of the word culture, what comes to mind? 

00:56:35
ANGEL Colombia. 

00:56:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Colombia. Okay. And that's where you're from? 

00:56:40
ANGEL That is where my family is from, yes. 

00:56:40
DR. ERIC GREEN That's where your family's from. Okay. 

00:56:40
ANGEL Yeah. 

00:56:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Tell me a little bit about Colombia and what you, have you ever been? 

00:56:45
ANGEL I have been to Colombia. 

00:56:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Tell me about what you know about it. Yeah. 

00:56:50
ANGEL Um, lots of hills, very green. 

00:56:50
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh-huh. 

00:56:55
ANGEL Nice country. I, um, enjoyed going there. Went and did horse riding. 

00:57:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh-huh. 

00:57:00
ANGEL Very, um, it was very different than it is here. 

00:57:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Sure. 

00:57:05
ANGEL And, it was, um, it was different, yeah. I enjoyed it. 

00:57:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, I think you said it very well. Culture is about geography. 

00:57:10
ANGEL Mm-hmm. 

00:57:10
DR. ERIC GREEN It's about where someplace is located. It's about, like, how we dress, it's, maybe, our age, right? And you're... 

00:57:20
ANGEL 14. 

00:57:20
DR. ERIC GREEN 14. Right. Uh, it's also about the food we eat, maybe the songs we listen to as a community. Um, maybe, the, our religious beliefs, where we all congregate to go to church. Does that make sense? 

00:57:30
ANGEL It does. 

00:57:30
DR. ERIC GREEN And, so, sometimes it's easier for teenagers, and for adults, a lot of the times, to be able to represent parts of themselves, and their families, and culture, by showing images in a collage. And, so, if you're feeling safe, and comfortable, I wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind going through some of those magazines, and picking images, maybe, ten or fifteen images... 

00:58:00
ANGEL Okay. 

00:58:00
DR. ERIC GREEN ...and cutting them out, and then gluing them wherever you'd like to. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to do this, it's just a part of who you are. 

00:58:05
ANGEL Right. 

00:58:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, and then, after you're finished, take your time, okay? We've got plenty of time. Let me know when you're done. I want you to incorporate your name somewhere in the collage. 

00:58:15
ANGEL Okay. 

00:58:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay? And then I'm going to ask you a couple questions, and then we may write a story, or a poem, or that can be it. It's up to you. Okay? 

00:58:25
ANGEL Okay. 

00:58:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Do you have any questions? 

00:58:30
ANGEL No. 

00:58:30
DR. ERIC GREEN No? Okay. All right. Would you like to hear music while we're creating? Or do you... 

00:58:35
ANGEL Sure. 

00:58:35
DR. ERIC GREEN ...appreciate silence? 

00:58:35
ANGEL I like music. 

00:58:35
DR. ERIC GREEN You like music? Okay. 

00:58:40
ANGEL Yep. 

00:58:40
DR. ERIC GREEN All right, so, I'm going to play some relaxation music, um, and, um, I'll, um, play that while you're creating, okay? 

00:58:45
ANGEL Okay. 

00:58:50
DR. ERIC GREEN All right. 

00:58:55
[sil.] 

00:59:00
ANGEL I like this one. 

00:59:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Ah. You, so, found something that you like? Great. 

00:59:05
ANGEL Yes. 

00:59:05
DR. ERIC GREEN If you want to just, maybe, you can cut that, is that... 

00:59:10
ANGEL Yeah. 

00:59:10
DR. ERIC GREEN ...the one you like? You can cut it out, if you'd like. 

00:59:10
ANGEL All right. 

00:59:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. And then glue it to wherever you'd like to on your... 

00:59:20
[sil.] 

01:00:05
ANGEL Okay. 

01:00:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. You're finished? 

01:00:05
ANGEL Yes. 

01:00:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, tell me, um, are, is there anything you'd like to share, rather, about your collage? I'm going to angle it a little bit this way, so we can look at it together. 

01:00:15
ANGEL Okay. 

01:00:15
DR. ERIC GREEN And, before you, I just wanted to say, thank you, I appreciate all the effort that you placed into finding the images. I was noticing, you were very careful about what you chose. And, so, is there anything you feel comfortable sharing with me, about this? 

01:00:30
ANGEL Well, I chose the soccer player, because, um, in my country, they like to play a lot of soccer. It's a big part of their culture, and, um, I still do it. I still like to, love to play it now, and, uh, it's, it's very important to me, it's a big part of my life, so... 

01:00:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:00:45
ANGEL ...I just, um, well, I chose that one. 

01:00:45
DR. ERIC GREEN I see. Okay. 

01:00:45
ANGEL (inaudible ). 

01:00:50
DR. ERIC GREEN And, I remember, uh, two weekends ago you were playing soccer. 

01:00:50
ANGEL I was. 

01:00:50
DR. ERIC GREEN And that's, yeah, I remember that, and I think we, uh, we talked later that day, or the next day, maybe, uh, when I, so, yeah, okay. 

01:01:00
ANGEL Yeah. And I chose this, right here, because, um, I love wildlife, and I felt like it represented, um, something that I love to be around, and look at, and, um... 

01:01:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:01:10
ANGEL ...experience. 

01:01:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:01:15
ANGEL This one, um, I chose this one because this is a, a, a very important festival in Colombia, it's called the Festival of Roses, and, um, people bring all these flowers, and they all, um, congregate in an area, where they talk, and they, um, have, um, just enjoy the, um, the coming together of, um, neighbors and stuff like that. 

01:01:40
ANGEL Mm-hmm. 

01:01:45
ANGEL So, this, right here, is a, um, a, uh, very special place in Colombia where, it's a park, and they have these statues all around that were made, uh, hundreds of years ago, and that are still standing there, and you can go there and look at them, and I went there as a child, and I still remember it today, so... 

01:02:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Oh. 

01:02:00
ANGEL ...that's why I chose that. 

01:02:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. So it's something that really resonated with you because of its significance, culturally, and, and, uh, symbolically? 

01:02:10
ANGEL Yes. Absolutely. 

01:02:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, last question, um, before we do this next part, which is, uh, tell me a little bit about your name. You've, you've placed it in the middle, is there any significance to that? 

01:02:25
ANGEL I felt like these, um, all of these images represented, um, who I am, and what I like to do... 

01:02:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:02:30
ANGEL ...what I repre-, what I, um, what resembles me... 

01:02:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:02:35
ANGEL ...as a person, so, that's why I did that. 

01:02:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Thank you. Uh, is there anything else about your collage you'd like to share? 

01:02:40
ANGEL Um, no, I think that's it. 

01:02:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. All right, so, as we're looking at this collage together, and there is a lot of symbols, and, and maybe even some, that looks like some, some of it that, do you what that is? 

01:02:55
ANGEL Yes. 

01:02:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. 

01:02:55
ANGEL That is a, um. 

01:03:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Empanada. 

01:03:00
ANGEL Yes. 

01:03:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. I've had those before. And do you like empanadas? 

01:03:00
ANGEL I love them. I mean. 

01:03:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay, and that's from Colombia. 

01:03:05
ANGEL It is. 

01:03:05
DR. ERIC GREEN You taught me something, today. I didn't know that. Thank you, Angel, thank you very much. So, um, as you've been kind of linking things, you've placed images on the collage, and you've linked parts of your culture to the image, and why you chose them. You talked about your personal sense of being out in the outdoors, you talked about the cultural event of soccer, in Colombia, and how that, you, resonate, that resonates with you. Um, uh, and you even brought in food, and geography, and exercise. I'm wondering, uh, there's three options you have, and you, you don't have to do any of these. It's up to you, really. It just helps us communicate more. One is, you can write a poem, uh, about your collage. Uh, a second thing is, you can, um, write the story of your collage on the back, like, the narrative story, like, if you looked at the pictures, like, if this was a movie, kind of, what would it say? And then the third piece is, um, we could listen to music from Colombia, and maybe that you like, or we could find some together on YouTube... 

01:04:05
ANGEL Mm-hmm. 

01:04:05
DR. ERIC GREEN ...and we can get a feel of the sense of the culture, uh, from the, from music. So, or we can do all three. So, I'll let you decide. 

01:04:10
ANGEL I think I'd like to do the poem. 

01:04:10
DR. ERIC GREEN The poem. Okay. Terrific. So, uh, listen, here's a piece of, let's see, what color paper would you like to use? 

01:04:20
ANGEL Can I have green, please? 

01:04:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Green, yes, sir. Green. Okay. There you go. So, there's green. And then, would you like a marker? Or would you like to use a pen? 

01:04:25
ANGEL Can I use a pen? 

01:04:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Sure. All right. And then, um, your poem can be anything you'd like for it to be, and, as you, we kind of have done this activity, if you want to think about the feelings you had, or that, something that you want to share about you, or your culture, or some part of you, and then I'll just, basically, be quiet while you're, uh, doing your poem. I'll put back on music, since you like music, if you like? Or it could be quiet. And then... 

01:04:50
ANGEL Um. Yeah, music sounds good. Uh-huh. 

01:04:50
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay, and then whenever you're done, let me know, and then I'll, uh, maybe, if you have anything you want to share about it. 

01:04:55
ANGEL Okay. 

01:04:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. 

01:05:00
[sil.] 

01:05:20
ANGEL Okay. I finished. 

01:05:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Angel, you're done? 

01:05:20
ANGEL Yes. 

01:05:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, so, it looks like you've written a poem. Uh, do you want to share anything about that with me? 

01:05:30
ANGEL Um, can I read it to you? 

01:05:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Sure, I'd, I'd enjoy hearing it, yeah. 

01:05:30
ANGEL The green hills roll along the countryside, soccer balls being kicked along the road, sound of wildlife resonating, the people from the country walking in peace. 

01:05:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. Okay. If you could give this poem a title, what would it be? 

01:05:50
ANGEL Um, Colombia. 

01:05:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Do you want to write that anywhere on your poem? 

01:05:55
ANGEL Yeah. 

01:06:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Okay. Now, would you like to cut it out, and, maybe, place it someplace on your collage? Okay? All right.? 

01:06:15
[sil.] 

01:07:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, you feel good about how it looks, now? 

01:07:05
ANGEL Yes. I do. 

01:07:05
DR. ERIC GREEN All right. Um. Angel, thank you so much for engaging, and, and, I kind of want to share what I've learned, a little bit, about you. 

01:07:10
ANGEL Okay. 

01:07:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Before I do that, I want to ask you a question. Is it okay if I turn it this way, so we can both see? 

01:07:15
ANGEL Sure. 

01:07:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, is there anything that you would like to have added that you didn't get a chance to add, or is there any part of you, that you feel safe sharing, that, maybe, you wish you could have shared? 

01:07:30
ANGEL Um, no, not specifically, no. 

01:07:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, you feel that this really, kind of caps, like, the biggest areas that are most important to you. 

01:07:40
ANGEL Yes. I feel like it's most of my life, really. 

01:07:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Yeah. Okay, cool. Um, and, so, some of the things that I've learned about you from doing this activity, um, were that you really enjoy the outdoors... 

01:07:55
ANGEL Okay. 

01:07:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, you enjoy connecting to your homeland, Colombia, which is important to you. There's a certain bit of spirituality, uh, that you appreciate, and honor, and so you hold something sacred. Uh, family's important to you. You talked about the roses and the, um, the cultural, uh, implications of, um, of ritual, and, so, that seems like something important. You also talked about food, empanadas, that, um, you enjoyed it. And, so, kind of what I got from adding all those together, and synthesizing them, is that part of who and what you are is not just on the outside, with food and, and, and fishing, but you have diverse interests, and you're very proud of what you are, and who you are, and, um, and it felt good to share these things with me, and to hear them being accepted. Is that correct? 

01:08:50
ANGEL That is correct. 

01:08:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Well, I appreciate your, uh, effort into this, and for sharing pieces, and images, of who you are. It's, um, it's a very special thing to be able to do this with, um, uh, with you, and I appreciate it as well. 

01:09:05
ANGEL Thank you. 

01:09:10
DR. ERIC GREEN In this session, Angel and I participated in the expressive art intervention I've created entitled "create your cultural collage." Angel picked several images, all centering around, as he indicated, parts of who he was, inner, and on the outside, or outer. He picked images related to outdoors; one such image had a large fish moving across, and he indicated that he really enjoyed being outdoors, that this was a part of where he was at this place in his life. It was important for him to engage in physical activity. He also showed a few pictures from his homeland of Colombia, which I was not aware of, until today. I found it extremely helpful to listen to him, and support him, as his face lit up when he began to describe the different cultural nuances to his home country of Colombia by showing me the images. One such image was the image of the three, uh, statues, uh, that he spoke about, um, which indicated a certain bit of, uh, just, a spiritual, an history. He also talked about the parade with roses. He also mentioned his, um, affinity for empanadas. I also remember him describing soccer, and how, um, which, again, links back to that physical outdoor piece, that the engagement in soccer, um, brings about a certain bit of satisfaction. He also wrote a poem and called it Colombia, where he talked about walking in the countryside in peace. To summarize this clinical session, what I've learned about Angel from this activity was that his history, uh, his visit to Colombia, even his time out in Los Angeles, were all extremely important to him, as it represented a substantial part of his self-forming adolescent identity. I also learned from Angel, from this experience between us, and the interactions between us, that it was helpful, and validating for him to be able to share this cultural collage, and to be met with non-judgmentalism. I believe he commented on this aspect of the intervention towards the end of the intervention. He felt a sense of connection with me because of the interaction when we engaged in the symbols. Finally, what I learned about myself was, I really enjoyed this experience with Angel because it allowed me to get to learn some things about a country that I don't know much about, nor have I visited, and, in that way, I acknowledged, and said something to the effect of, 'wow, Angel, you've taught me some stuff today that I really appreciate.' This activity, overall, engendered uninterrupted communication, a sense of self creativity, and, also, it honored the importance of rich cultural traditions as it relates to an emerging adolescent self identity and development.

Expressive Arts Intervention "Color Your Mendala" With Angel 

01:12:55
DR. ERIC GREEN So, hi, Angel. 

01:12:55
ANGEL Hi. 

01:12:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Welcome back, uh, to another expressive art therapy session. 

01:13:00
ANGEL Thank you. 

01:13:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh, you're welcome. Today we're going to be doing this technique that I've created called color your mandala. 

01:13:05
ANGEL Okay. 

01:13:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh, and, basically, I've put several different mandala shapes in front of you. I want to tell you a little bit about what this activity is. It's one of the expressive art interventions that I use with, uh, adolescents, uh, adults enjoy this, sometimes, um, and what it helps many people do is it helps, including me, when I do color them, it helps you to feel less anxious. It also has a soothing quality of communicating, maybe, different parts of ourself that might be otherwise hard to do, verbally. And, so, mandalas, we see, throughout history. There's, um, like, for instance, if we look, like that crown behind you, that's a mandala. Um, mandalas are usually circular shapes with some type of, well, they can be squares or triangles, too, but there's usually some type of dynamic in the middle. Like that clock on the wall, that's basically a mandala. Can you think of a mandala? Um. 

01:14:10
ANGEL Um. Um. I can't think of one right now, no. 

01:14:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Think about what warms the wh-, what warms the Earth. 

01:14:25
ANGEL The sun? 

01:14:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Yeah, maybe the sun, right? Because it's circular, and it's got beams shooting out, right? 

01:14:25
ANGEL Yeah, that makes sense, yeah. 

01:14:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, maybe the moon? Is the moon round? Yeah, the moon's round. 

01:14:35
ANGEL Yeah. 

01:14:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, so, um, even, like, uh, are you familiar with the pop singer Lady Gaga? 

01:14:40
ANGEL Yes. I am. 

01:14:40
DR. ERIC GREEN She, a couple years ago, she came out in a round, like, egg-shaped thing. 

01:14:45
ANGEL Mm-hmm. 

01:14:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Do you remember that, when she did this? 

01:14:45
ANGEL No. No. 

01:14:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. And, so, that was a mandala. Um, also, a lot of time, in churches, there's stained glass windows that are in the shapes of circles. Um, and those are mandalas. So, um, what we, as therapists, believe, uh, is that mandalas have a way of unifying, or organizing, or helping us organize our thoughts, and fears, and containing them. Um, or putting them within one succinct place so that we can kind of take those fears, a little bit, our, our happiness, or joy, or sorrow, kind of out of our mind, and externalize, or put them down onto paper, and then, in some magical way - in fact, that's what I call it with children, when I work with young kids, I call it a magic circle - um, we're able to have control over it, and we're able to feel, maybe, a little bit better about some aspect of something if we need to. Uh, does that make sense? 

01:15:40
ANGEL It does. 

01:15:40
DR. ERIC GREEN And, uh, mandalas have been used for hundreds and hundreds of years. Giordano Bruno, um, he was the first, uh, this Italian guy, um, who used them, that was like in the, I think the 1500s. 

01:15:55
ANGEL Wow. 

01:15:55
DR. ERIC GREEN So, it's been around a long time. Um, so, anyway, I have six mandalas, here, that, um, I've picked from my workbook, and, um, you're free to, to choose one of these mandalas, um, or you can draw one, uh, a free one on your own. 

01:16:10
ANGEL Okay. 

01:16:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Um, and before we do that, I want us to first take a few minutes to do deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation, because that helps us calm our minds, and make choices and decisions, when we're doing this expressive work, that's truly personifies, or emblemizes, who we are inside. So, why don't we take, let's say, do you want to lead us in three deep breaths? In... 

01:16:40
ANGEL Yes. 

01:16:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. You ready? I'm, okay. 

01:16:45
[sil.] 

01:16:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay, let's clench our fists, tight, tight, tight; it'll help get some of the stress, and then breathe out, and then release your fists. Okay, and then let's put up our shoulders, by our ears, tight, tight, tight, like that, and then feel all the stress, and then release. Okay, and then we can maybe lean our head to the right, so that it's by our shoulder, and then bring it down to the middle, so that our chin's by our chest, and then back to the other side, and then we'll come back up, and we'll take one more deep breath. 

01:17:35
[sil.] 

01:17:40
DR. ERIC GREEN How do you feel, now? 

01:17:40
ANGEL I feel good. 

01:17:40
DR. ERIC GREEN I feel more relaxed. Okay. So, I want you to choose whichever mandala you're drawn to without thinking about it, just pick the one that speaks to you instantly. 

01:17:50
ANGEL Okay, I think, like, pick this one, right here. 

01:17:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. You've made a decision. This one, okay. All right, so, I'm going to move these out the way, I'll put these over here, okay. And you're certainly welcome to come back to any of these later, in another session, if you want, like, to do those, okay? 

01:18:05
ANGEL Okay. 

01:18:05
DR. ERIC GREEN So, basically, um, you can use colors, markers, crayons, paint, and, um, complete these mandala, or color it, any way that you'd like to. There's no right or wrong way to do it, and, um, when you're done, I probably will ask you , um, if you could write a story, or a poem, about your mandala. 

01:18:30
ANGEL Okay. 

01:18:30
DR. ERIC GREEN And, basically, I'll pretty much be quite, while you're creating, so I don't disturb you. Um, would you like silence, or would you like for me to play relaxation music? 

01:18:40
ANGEL Can I have relaxation music, please? 

01:18:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Sure. Okay, that's something that you enjoy, I remember that from our last session. And, uh, whenever you're ready, you can begin, and take your time. 

01:18:50
ANGEL Okay. 

01:18:55
[sil.] 

01:19:20
ANGEL Okay. I'm finished. 

01:19:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. You're done. 

01:19:20
ANGEL Yeah. 

01:19:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. All right, so, why don't we look at the image together, is that okay? Uh, and just kind of honor the image in silence for a minute. 

01:19:35
[sil.] 

01:19:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Thank you for putting so much effort into that. Um, now that you've finished your mandala, um, I'd like for you to write the story of your mandala on the back. 

01:20:00
ANGEL Okay. 

01:20:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Or, you can write a poem, and what that means, Angel, is when you look at it, in this space that we're creating between us, that's safe, and without judgment. I want you to think of what story does your mandala say to you? In other words, when you look at it, how are you relating to it? Are you seeing parts of a story of your life, of others? And you can either, um, write a story, and here's a couple pencils for you, or you can write a poem. Which one... 

01:20:30
ANGEL Okay. 

01:20:30
DR. ERIC GREEN ...would you rather, or, you can write none. 

01:20:30
ANGEL I'll write a poem. 

01:20:30
DR. ERIC GREEN You want to write a poem? 

01:20:30
ANGEL Yes. 

01:20:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. All right, so, listen, here's a pencil, and then whenever you're ready, you can begin, and I'll, as, as I have been with other, um, drawings, and art, I'll be quiet, while you create. 

01:20:40
ANGEL Okay. Thank you. 

01:20:50
[sil.] 

01:21:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, Angel, it looks like you're finished. 

01:21:10
ANGEL I am. 

01:21:10
DR. ERIC GREEN All right. Is there anything about your poem that you'd like to share? 

01:21:15
ANGEL Well, I noticed, when I was looking at this, um, I saw eyes... 

01:21:20
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:21:20
ANGEL ...all over the, um, the picture, and, um, I noticed them everywhere, so, I thought it was interesting, and I wrote about that. 

01:21:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:21:35
ANGEL So. 

01:21:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Would you like to share what you wrote? Or, you can, you can keep it private, or I can read it silently, it's up to you. 

01:21:40
ANGEL Can you read it silently? 

01:21:45
Knowing Owl, stare into the night with knowing eyes. The eyes look into the heart and bring out the best in us. 

01:21:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Sure. Okay. 

01:21:45
ANGEL Thank you. 

01:21:50
DR. ERIC GREEN Wow. Thank you for allowing me to see that. If there was a title you could give to this poem, what would it be? 

01:22:00
ANGEL Um. 

01:22:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Do you want to write it? 

01:22:00
ANGEL Yes. 

01:22:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. 

01:22:05
[sil.] 

01:22:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Oh, I see. Okay. So, um, I really appreciate you doing this activity with me. Do you mind if I turn back over your mandala? 

01:22:20
ANGEL (inaudible ). 

01:22:25
DR. ERIC GREEN And, um, I'll take a picture of this, and keep this in your file, and at the end of therapy, you'll have all of your images back, but I'll keep those for now, to contain, remember that, what we talked about earlier? Contained? 

01:22:35
ANGEL Yes. 

01:22:35
DR. ERIC GREEN To keep them sacred? And, um, I appreciate you doing this activity with me. Thank you. 

01:22:40
ANGEL Thank you. 

01:22:40
DR. ERIC GREEN In this session, Angel and I co-participated in an expressive art intervention titled "color your mandala." First, I presented Angel with several diverse images of mandalas taken directly from my workbook, "Color Your Mandala." I had Angel engage in some relaxation, and he was immediately drawn to the image, what looks sort of like a large, cultural, or some type of mask, uh, tribal, almost, a tribal looking mask, that he was drawn to. I watched him intently as soft, relaxing music played in the background, and he took his time, and engaged, and carefully chose each color, carefully choosing not only the shades, but the level of intensity in which he chose to color the actual parts of the mask. I noticed that when he was coloring the red, he was doing the coloring in a more robust fashion, and when he was doing the lighter colors of the mask, the yellow, there seemed to be a noticeable lightness in his mechanisms for coloring. This relates to, possibly, the feelings that these colors, um, induced, or brought up for him, internally, and how he manifested that connection with the colors, externally. There is no judgment, or analysis, made on this, other than the interactions between us, amongst us, and around us. I also noticed that, after he was finished his mandala, he chose to write a poem, which shows me that he values creativity, which makes him an excellent candidate for the expressive arts. He wrote a poem, and the interesting, or one of the many interesting things about this adolescent, was his intention to write the poem and then have us communicate at a silent level. He was internalizing the process of honoring the sacred, and he did this, almost initially, at an unconscious level, and then at a very conscious level. I met this request with acceptance, and with encouragement, as it showed me he felt safe enough, and free enough, with me, to engage in a silent honoring of his words, and his language. Also, it may have felt more safe to him for me to read the words silently. That possibly decreased any experiential anxiety of being judged, or of being evaluated, by something so fresh, and new, such a poem related to an abstract mandala, or collage. What did I learn about Angel? And what did I learn about our relationship from this expressive activity? First, I believe, I learned about Angel that he not only appreciates, but excels in expressive ideas, interventions, and appreciates, and values, the experience of self expression by a trusting, caring adult. Second, I learned that he uses, or utilizes, poetry and poems as a form of inner expression. His poem, while we did not read it out loud, had to do with looking, and seeing, and he pointed out, verbally, that he saw many eyes in his mandala. Again, to me, this relates back to, without analyzing his artwork, just talking about the relational quality that I observed, his burgeoning and developing adolescent self identity, which is so contingent, important, to, and dependent upon, pro-social behaviors and healthy socializations. So, while he's looking around, engaging, who's accepting, who's valuing him, who's judging him, he sees eyes in the mandala, he writes about them on the back of the poem. To me, this is a very typical developmental epic. To me, this is a very typical development epic, and what it shows me about this child, or adolescent, is that he is very much in the trajectory of his developmental epic, as he should be. He acknowledges this, he relishes in this, and it is something of great importance to him, as displayed through the very colorful, and creative, mandala he produced.

Expressive Arts Intervention "Sandplay" With Angel 

01:27:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Angel, this next expressive art intervention that we're going to do is called sandplay, and, uh, sandplay is, basically, giving you the opportunity, um, to create what we call a sand picture in this sand tray. And, if you want to just run your hands through it, if you'd like. Do you like sand? 

01:28:00
ANGEL I do. 

01:28:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Um, oftentimes, in therapy, we say that feeling the sand, touching the sand, is soothing, and has the kinesthetic quality of, of kind of soothing, and, is, how does it feel? 

01:28:10
ANGEL It's very, very cool, very, um... 

01:28:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Uh-huh. 

01:28:15
ANGEL Very relaxing. 

01:28:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. I just got this sand, uh, for this session today. It's brand new, literally, actually. When, do you have any memories of sand, or, of, of playing in it? 

01:28:25
ANGEL I do. Um, when I lived in Los Angeles I lived right next to the beach, so I would go there often, and I would love to play in the sand, and, um, make sand castles, and bury myself, so, I have very good memories with sand. 

01:28:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Oh, so, when you were a kid, sand was some part of your fun when you would go to the beach in L.A.? 

01:28:45
ANGEL Yes. 

01:28:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Great. Um, I share some of those, uh, memories with you as well. I remember enjoying lots of sand castles, when I was a kid, and still do, actually. So, uh, why don't we, can you guess what we're going to do next, before we get into the activity? Do you know what we're going to do? 

01:29:00
ANGEL Um. 

01:29:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Probably some deep breathing? 

01:29:00
ANGEL Right. 

01:29:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Yes. 

01:29:00
ANGEL Yes. 

01:29:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, why don't we do, um, three deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. And deep breathe in through the nose, and out through the mouth, and deep breathe in through the nose, and out through the mouth, and then, in your mind, and in my mind, I want to count to ten, silently, without saying it out loud, and, as we're counting, let's both just clear our heads of any anxiety, of any stress, in my case, of wondering what we're going to have for lunch, um, and then, whenever you're ready, and you feel that your mind is blank, or as close as it can be to being quiet, just slowly open your eyes, and I'll do the same. Okay? So, I'm going to start ten in my head, and you start whenever you're ready. 

01:30:05
[sil.] 

01:30:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay, looks like we're both having a, a, a quieter mind, now. I feel quieter. 

01:30:15
ANGEL Yes. 

01:30:15
DR. ERIC GREEN You do, too. Okay. So, sand picture. A sand picture, if you look behind, all of these symbols, um, there are different symbols, there are different cultures, there's different activities, and they can mean whatever you want them to mean, it's up for you to decide. 

01:30:35
ANGEL Okay. 

01:30:35
DR. ERIC GREEN And, basically, um, you can take any of those miniatures that you'd like, or none, and if you'd like to create what we call a sand picture, and that's placing them somewhere in this sand tray, however you'd like to, and, basically, I'm going to be very quiet, and I'm going to move off to the side, here, so that I don't interrupt your private space, so that you can feel safe. This is a very sacred thing, in that it's very private, and it's very individual, and I want to honor that with you. So, whenever you're done, let me know. And, remember, there's no right or wrong way to do it. 

01:31:10
ANGEL Okay. 

01:31:15
DR. ERIC GREEN And, um, after you're done, I may ask you, is there anything you'd like to share? And you don't have to share anything if you don't want to, okay? 

01:31:20
ANGEL Okay. 

01:31:20
DR. ERIC GREEN And there's no right or wrong way to do it. Okay? 

01:31:25
ANGEL Okay. 

01:31:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Do you have any questions? 

01:31:25
ANGEL No. 

01:31:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Um, all right, so, then, I'll sit here, and you take your time, and, um, just let me know whenever you're done. 

01:31:35
ANGEL Okay. 

01:31:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. 

01:31:40

01:34:20
[sil.] 

01:34:25
ANGEL Okay. 

01:34:25
DR. ERIC GREEN All right. Is there anything you'd like to share about your sand picture? 

01:34:30
ANGEL Um, I chose these, um, uh, predators, because I, I thought they're very interesting, and, um, they, uh, they show you just how, um, just how small you are compared to other things on, on Earth, and, um. 

01:34:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:34:55
ANGEL Like, these cows, they're, they're going to be eaten by the, uh, the tiger, there. 

01:35:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:35:00
ANGEL And it just reminds me of how, um, how small we are, and... 

01:35:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:35:10
ANGEL ...that there's, uh, there's bigger things out there. 

01:35:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:35:10
ANGEL I chose the airplane because, um, I love, I love to fly, um... 

01:35:15
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:35:20
ANGEL ...and, finally, the dog because I love dogs, I have one, so... 

01:35:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:35:25
ANGEL ...that's why. 

01:35:30
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. So, Angel, uh, right now, in the sandplay process, I just want to be able to honor you, and your work, and your work, and your images, by observing them in silence. How does that sound to you? 

01:35:45
ANGEL Sounds good. 

01:35:45
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. It's kind of like inner art, so, um, I'm just going to look, and to see what you've done. 

01:35:50
[sil.] 

01:36:05
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Thank you, so much, for sharing your sand picture. 

01:36:10
ANGEL Um. I think I would like to add one more thing to the sandplay, actually, in this documentary. 

01:36:10
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Sure. You can decide that. Sure. 

01:36:20
[sil.] 

01:36:35
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. Okay, so, now you feel like your sand picture is complete? 

01:36:40
ANGEL Yes, I do. 

01:36:40
DR. ERIC GREEN Okay. Is there anything, um, that you want to share about your, um, sand picture, now? 

01:36:50
ANGEL I chose the, the truck, because I absolutely love cars, and I love everything about them. 

01:36:55
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:36:55
ANGEL They, um, they interest me a lot, and I, I just love them. 

01:37:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. 

01:37:00
ANGEL So, that's why I chose that. 

01:37:00
DR. ERIC GREEN Mm-hmm. Okay. So, now, I'm going to honor, if it's okay... 

01:37:05
ANGEL Mm-hmm. 

01:37:05
DR. ERIC GREEN ...your image, in, again... 

01:37:05
ANGEL Okay. 

01:37:10
DR. ERIC GREEN ...because, uh, I wanted to show you, uh, how I respect you and your, um, your sand picture. Okay? 

01:37:20
[sil.] 

01:37:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Thank you so much for coming in. It's been a pleasure. 

01:37:25
ANGEL It's been a pleasure, as well. 

01:37:25
DR. ERIC GREEN Thank you. In this session, Angel and I engaged in the sacred space of sandplay. In this session, Angel had many sand miniatures and multiple symbols from which to choose to create his very own sand picture. I observed Angel as he went from shelf to shelf, from miniature to miniature, carefully scrutinizing multiple objects, trying to find exactly what he wanted to express, in that moment, without fear of judgment, and free from intrusions. In a fair amount of time, he created the image, uh, and he described it as predators, I think he used the word lions, uh, coming up, and they were behind these other animals. He also had a red truck, and he said that he liked cars, everything about cars, actually, and he smiled when he said that, uh, there was a sense of life, and vitality. He also had an airplane submerged halfway in the sand, but sticking up. Without going into an analysis of his sand picture, as that would not necessarily be appropriate from an expressive art intervention, what I did understand about Angel from this sand picture was that he was continuing with the theme of self expression, and felt safe enough to even go deeper into this current developmental epic that he's in, which is of socialization, of being watched, of being judged by peers, of fitting in, of being devoured, of eyes, of visibility. All of these pieces are all typically congruent with a 14-year-old who is navigating the social and peer, sometimes pitfalls, that life sometimes throws their way. Finally, what did I learn about myself, and about the space between us from this exercise, the sandplay picture? What I concluded with was that through the sandplay projection, through that externalization, he was able to go deeper into the expressive arts to submit, and to, uh, verbalize, his probably most intimate retellings of his psyche, or from what was within, and he said it, um, without me having to analyze or provide him the information. He said there are, basically, animals being watched, animals being attacked, animals being prey, but there's also a truck, of movement, an automobile, of red, and there was a plane, and, sometimes, when we look at planes in sand pictures, sometimes they could symbolize the ego, um, or sometimes they could just be a plane in the sand. What I saw was a very healthy adolescent development being demonstrated in this sand picture, and I appreciated the effort he placed into the sand picture, as well as honored the free and protected space, probably the most important aspect when conducting sandplay therapy with adolescents.
