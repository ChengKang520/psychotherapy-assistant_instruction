UNKNOWN So now it's my pleasure to introduce Nicole Buchanan who will be initiating the first presentation on psycho diagnosis and psychological assessment.

NICOLE BUCHANAN Good morning. Let's make sure everything's working. So today I have the honor of presenting to you on a topic that I find very interesting and incredibly important, and that is the diagnostic and assessment process as it applies to African American patients. When we talk about diagnosis and assessment with people of color, we almost automatically have to initiate a conversation about bias in this process. And because I realize probably everyone in this room is already well versed in how to do a quality psychological assessment, I'm not going to be offering a primer on the how-to's of each piece. Instead I'm going to focus in on some sources of bias in this process of diagnosis and assessment. And I'm going to focus my talk on black Americans in the United States. Specifically I'm going to be focusing on second, third, fourth generations. People that were born here. When I thought about all the material I wanted to cover, I determined that covering the specific concerns and the additional burdens of recent and established immigrants just would not be possible in the amount of time that we have. So it's beyond the scope of this talk, but please know that those are important considerations that augment what I'm talking about today. We all know that bias in psychology has been longstanding. We know that it's deeply embedded into the framework of our everyday practices, and because it is so deeply embedded, it renders it virtually invisible. However in as early as 1930, there was a publication issuing a challenge to the field of psychology to pay attention to this issue of bias in the field, and that specifically when we engage in diagnosis and assessment with people of color, we need to be particularly cognizant of the many sources of bias that are inherent within the process. Now despite that being over 80 years ago, racial bias and diagnosis and assessment and the need for multicultural competence has only recently garnered much attention. If you were to look at the publications on this topic, you'd find that over 90% of the articles and chapters on culture and clinical interviewing and 66% on culture and diagnosis have only been published within the last 20 to 25 years. Much of the attention on multicultural competence has been directly linked to the findings of the 2007 census and what they call the diversification of the United States. Both the 200 and the 2002 US census bureau projections indicated that the US is rapidly becoming a minority majority country, meaning we are soon going to have more ethnic minorities than we have whites in this country. To demonstrate the extent of these changes, if you go back just a couple of decades, to 1990, over 76% of the population was white. Go back to 2000. This percentage dropped to 69%. And the expectation is that as recently as 2050 and to be honest some think this will happen even before then, that this is going to drop below that 50% mark. There's even been extrapolations just going a few years further into 2100 and they find that the percentage of whites in this country is likely to be as low as 38%. So what are the implications of a demographic shift this large for the field of psychology? Well as we look up, as we look at the up and coming psychology majors, you know you look at those first year students in college, as you look at our graduate students in psychology, one thing becomes clear. The ethnicities of clinicians isn't changing anywhere near as rapidly as the ethnicities of our population. In fact if you look, you'll see that the vast majority are still women and they're still white women. What this means is clinicians are going to increasingly be called up on to work with ethnic minority populations, people that don't share their ethnic background. Not only are there going to be more ethnic minority clients, but the world views of ethnic minority clients are likely to differ considerably from those of traditional therapists. And these differences are likely to center around concepts that we hold sacrosanct in psychology. Things like how do we define and consider mental illness, what's normal, what's abnormal, who counts as someone qualified to engage in therapy and to offer healing, what kinds of treatments are actually legitimate forms of treatment for mental illness. These will all be challenged as we enter into this new millennium. So given these changes, cultural competence will have an increasing importance if we want therapy to be effective as we see more and more diverse clients. So although it's useful to talk about what's coming up in the future, let's just take a moment and think about what's happening in the here and now. The US Surgeon General reports that the mental health status of ethnic minorities in this country has a number of problems as far as how we are dealing with it as a field. One, as a general rule, the mental health needs of people of color in this country are going unmet. There's a strong need for an understanding of both the cultural factors as well as the sociopolitical factors that impact these groups, that shape their experiences, and that impact their feelings and beliefs about mental illness and about seeking treatment. And cultural competence, although we've known of its importance, it remains an essential component if we're going to offer quality, useful mental and physical healthcare for people of color. Specifically for black Americans, what do we see? I could give you any number of statistics, but perhaps one of the most meaningful ones, blacks are 20% more likely to report having serious levels of psychological distress than are whites in this country. But whites are far more likely to actually receive treatment and to receive quality treatment, things such as psychopharmocology and antidepressants. How widespread is this problem? Well let's take something incredibly serious like suicide. What we know is that suicide among black Americans has been increasing dramatically and this is really quite incredible because traditionally, black people don't do suicide. This isn't something that is common in the culture. So the idea that it is increased 233% among 10 to 14 year old's compared to 120% increase for whites is really quite striking. And we also know that there are gender considerations and we're going to talk only briefly but we need to be thinking about intersecting identities, and one of the things we know is that for black men, the rates of suicide are roughly four times the rates for black women. And when we look at issues like poverty and how that ethnic minority status combines with poverty, we see that mental illness and severe psychological distress is over three times as common if you're both black and poor. Cultural competence is thought to be one of the core values that's going to provide the scaffolding for any intervention that's designed to actually improve and work for ethnic minority clients and to reverse the kinds of statistics I've just presented to you. So to define a little bit of this. What exactly is culture? One, culture is defined as the combination of the body of knowledge, beliefs, behaviors. It involves personal identification, language, thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values, as well as the institutions that are often specific to ethnic minority, religious minority, racial groups. When it comes to the client and the provider, these elements influence the beliefs and the belief systems regarding things like health, healing, wellness and illness, disease and how services should be delivered and what services count. What's really critical in understanding how culture plays out is the fact that culture is largely invisible to us and we don't recognize that there's a potential for differences until something happens that confronts us with those differences. This means we tend to move forward in the world and we act as if we are all thinking and feeling and understanding the world in the same way and this contributes to disconnects between individuals and can feel quite jarring for others, particularly for those who have less power than us. So the concept of cultural competency refers to the set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, policies, that allow us to work effectively cross cultures and cross cultural situations. It reflects our capacity for functioning effectively within the context of cultural beliefs that differ from our own. What we know is that cultural competency has positive impacts on treatment outcomes. It lets providers deliver services that are both respectful and responsive to the health, beliefs, practices, and the cultural and linguistic needs of the clients. And cultural sensitivity has been found to positively influence treatment outcomes and the effects of psychological intervention. When we talk about cultural competence, one of the things you'll notice is very often it's discussed within the realm of therapeutic intervention so ongoing counseling. And this begs the question of to what extent does cultural competence matter for the diagnostic and assessment process? In all honesty, far less is known about this and far less is done about the way cultural competence influences diagnosis and assessment. But of course, they're equally relevant and in some ways I'm going to point out how it might be even more relevant in this particular part of therapy. We also know that diagnostic assessment can be especially challenging when we have a clinician from one ethnic group and a client from another, and they're trying to evaluate how the DSM categories apply to that particular individual. Someone who's unfamiliar with the nuances of an individual's cultural frame of reference may incorrectly judge behaviors that might be perfectly normative within that culture as being pathological and abnormal. One example might be certain religious practices or beliefs being misdiagnosed as manifestations of psychotic disorder. So someone who talks about a recent death in the family and talks about having heard or seen that loved one after their passing, telling them that they're okay, they've moved on, they're good. It would be easy for someone to misinterpret that if they aren't familiar with that being a common part of black culture. APA guidelines provide a number of important facets of cultural competence and I'm just going to highlight a couple of them here that pertain specifically to the assessment process. So one the culturally competent therapist understands what kind of biases impact assessment, evaluation and diagnosis. A therapist that's culturally competent understands race, ethnicity, and culture affects on personality formation, psychological disorders, symptom expression and communication of symptoms regarding illness. They understand culture bound, class bound and linguistic features of psychological distress, and they have an understanding of the institutional barriers, discrimination and minority stress that influences the development and the exacerbation of symptoms. And culturally sensitive assessment has been defined as the following. Psychological assessment is made culturally sensitive through the continuing and open ended series of substantive and methodological insertions and adaptations designed to mesh the process of assessment and evaluation with the cultural characteristics of the group being studied. The insertions and adaptations span the entire assessment and the entire evaluation process from development and adaptation of instruments to administration of the measure and to analysis and scoring and interpretation of those scores. Thus assessment is made culturally sensitive through an incessant basic and active preoccupation with the culture of the group of individual being assessed. Test users need to be conscious of culturally specific behaviors or areas of development such as ethnic identity that have not been viewed as significant concerns and test theory or development. So one way we can achieve more culturally sensitive assessments is to actually understand the sources where we may get differences in the information we collect from clients and from the testing material. And these sources can be roughly broken down into information variance, criterion variance, and patient variance. Information variance talks about there being differences in the kind of data we receive. For example, the kinds of questions that go asked or unasked make a difference in what kind of information we actually find out. As an example, I'm a trauma person. I'm kind of into trauma, and so I'm going to be very thoughtful and I'm going to be listening and I may follow up more aggressively on hints that I have about a client experiencing trauma. Someone who is not as interested in trauma and maybe their focus is more on depression, they may focus more on questions related to their depression symptoms. As a result, we come away with differing sets of information if we're not systematic in getting information on all of their symptoms. There's also differences in the inferences we make about the severity of the symptoms. It becomes very easy to either over rely or under rely on particular symptoms when we're trying to conceptualize the nature and the severity of a client's illness. And we'll talk about this a bit more but one of the ways this commonly occurs is looking at symptoms of paranoia and psychosis among black Americans and that typically people will over rely on psychosis and not as thoroughly evaluate symptoms of depression. There's also issues of patient variance, just the patient themselves giving very different information. They may choose to disclose certain symptoms and not disclose others. They may describe certain symptoms very fully or they may be more guarded in talking about them. And this can happen for any number of reasons including issues of stigma and just the basic acceptability of talking about a particular topic. These three kinds of issues can impact assessment whether you're talking about assessment measures but it can also influence the clinical interview. So you see these in all ways in which we do our assessments but I do think it can be useful to take them each in turn. So that's what we'll do here. So given that most clinicians do use some psychological tests as part of their assessment process, these are but a handful, there's many more, but a handful of the kinds of concerns with bias that come up when you're evaluating black Americans and other people of color. So one, there are issues in the content and whether or not it's appropriate for the group being studied. One thing that is very common is that tests are designed and based on the experiences of majority group members, and they then are scored in a way that favors majority group members. One example might be the process of individuation and separation that is deemed normal and acceptable, maybe even positive for adolescents and majority culture. If ethnic minorities come from a culture where it is less appropriate for them to individuate and separate from parents, perhaps where it's acceptable to live at home and be actively engaged with your family until you leave the home for marriage, then those clients might actually look as if they're pathologically enmeshed if they're used, if traditional measures are used to evaluate their individuation process. There are also questions about the standardization samples for different measures. Minorities might be represented in a standardization sample in perhaps a way that's equal with their representation in the country. Or you might imagine a sample could, say, have 2% American Indian population represented in their norming sample and could actually argue that they're over represented American Indians, but the problem with that is there's not enough people to actually influence how the measures would be scored. So then when you use that same measure and you apply it to one individual, this, the norming scores no longer apply to that group of people. There are also concerns with language bias and sometimes it's as simple as the way the instructions are worded or the way they're communicated by the evaluator, can evoke some stigma, make people uncomfortable, and then spuriously affect their test scores. You may have where the tests are measuring constructs that are not the same across different cultures. And you may have where the tests themselves don't adequately predict what an individual may do. For example if you give a test of extroversion or introversion, you may give that test and it's been normed and based on the extroversion and behavior of white Americans and then when you apply the test results and you try to predict how they'll act in a social situation, it may not apply whatsoever and it may not predict how say traditional black Muslims in the United States would behave in a social interaction across gender. So we have to know who the tests were designed for, how they were normed, how the constructs apply and how we talk about them with clients. So when we talk about having culturally competent quality assessments with African Americans, it requires that clinicians consider the instruments that they're using in conducting the evaluation and guard against the kinds of concerns that I've just talked about. One item of concern or worth thinking about is the cultural loading within the test. So cultural loading refers to the extent to which that test or any item within the test requires specific knowledge about a particular culture in order to answer it correctly. The reality is it's very difficult to imagine how you would word any test that didn't have some degree of cultural loading, some degree of knowledge about the context, the images, the concepts that are particular to a cultural group. And the reality also is that having some cultural loading doesn't automatically mean that a measure is culturally biased. But the problem is people rarely empirically test whether or not that's true, and so people will assume that a test is either culturally biased or that it has cultural equivalence across groups. And what's really more important is that we empirically validate whether or not a particular measure is appropriate for use with a particular group. So switching gears a little bit and talking about clinical interviews. Clinical interviews, one, they are typically the most common assessment tool that clinicians will use. And even when clinicians use other measures, this is generally the very first assessment tool that they'll use. So how might this play out? When we compare white Americans to black Americans, we know that black Americans are far more likely to terminate therapy after a single session. What this means is if the diagnostic interview is what's happening in that very first session, then this may actually be quite useful in the retention of black Americans in therapy if we learn to do it properly. So we need to understand how that clinical interview is subject to a variety of forms of bias and how provider and client misunderstandings and miscommunications can have a significant impact on the diagnostic process. So if you've watched tapes of clinical interviews and diagnostic assessment, it becomes obvious if there's a cross racial or cross cultural diad that the clinicians and the clients individual identities and their individual world views can have a dramatic impact on this process. Our world view and cultural identity is going to influence things like our idioms of distress, our explanations of illness, the stressors we perceive in our world, where we go for support, as well as cultural elements of the therapist and client diad. I argue that clinicians really must do the soul work as I call it, the soul work necessary to understand their own identity first. And then if they do this, they're in a better position to assess and understand that of their clients and interpret the data through the lenses of a particular client. And this is critically important. Without an understanding of our own world views, how they influence our thinking, how they influence our behaviors and assumptions about the world, then we end up imposing those beliefs on others. And we assume that they share our personal values and that these things are universal. So when an individual functions, thinks, behaves differently, it becomes very easy for us to assume that they are defective, they are deficient, or they are pathological. So we have to do our own work if we want to emerge as culturally competent clinicians engaging in culturally sensitive assessment. Some other issues that are of varying importance include things like ethnic match of the therapist and the client, nonverbal communication, how people use language, issues of stigma and shame as well as issues of explicit and implicit bias. So we're going to take each of these in turn. Ethnic match. This is one of those topics that has received a lot of attention and there's a lot of folklore about how important ethnic match may be. Well the data suggests that ethnic match actually has much greater importance in the initial session because if you go back to what I was just talking about, that's when people tend to drop out of therapy. Black people tend to drop out of therapy. So ethnic match ends up being much more important during that initial phase of treatment, but the global impact of a ethnic match really is not as big as we once thought, especially if people stay in treatment for a while. So basically what that ends up meaning is if clients, if we can get black clients to come back for a few sessions, and certainly if they come back for more sessions, that they can have similarly effective treatment outcomes as white Americans, but the key is that first session. So with regard to assessment, the fact that many black Americans don't return for second session is extremely important because our assessment and our determination of their accurate diagnosis is often very brief and may actually start and end within that single session. So the effects of ethnic match may diminish over the course of treatment but it still holds significant importance when we talk about assessment. The way we communicate withing the client/clinician diad is also quite important. And specifically there's nonverbal factors that may impact how that communication functions, things like interpersonal distance, touch whether or not that's appropriate and various forms of body language come into play. As an example, there are differences across cultures in the appropriateness of eye gaze, and for black Americans, prolonged eye gaze is typically associated with feeling, with presumptions that the person feels that they're superior. It's seen as disrepectful, threatening or even insulting. In fact, black Americans typically will maintain eye contact while speaking to you but avoid eye contact while listening to you, and this is the opposite pattern of white Americans. So imagine how that might play out if a clinician, a white clinician is asked a black client a question, it's quite possible that they may seem like they're being evasive, like maybe they're distracted. Or not asking a question when they're listening, they may seem evasive, they may seem distracted, avoidant, and yet none of that is true. It's just differences in how they maintain eye contact during communication. And those are just the nonverbals. Then we get into spoken language and there are a number of ways in which miscommunications can also occur here. Most of the discussions about language and these miscommunications tend to focus on two individuals who com to the table with different first languages. But the reality is that there's lots and lots of ways that you can experience miscommunication even when you both presumably grew up speaking the exact same language. So some of the potential issues are differences in communication style, assumptions about the role of doctor and patient, and what's okay to say and who's supposed to say it and how you're allowed to say it based on which role you have. People may have very different beliefs about communication around health issues, may have different beliefs about their ability to affect change in their health lives, and they may also have very different sets and skill sets around negotiating when there is miscommunication or when there is conflict in these communications. It's also possible that when we're asking our questions and assessments, the questions we're asking don't actually have conceptual semantic or cultural equivalence for the two people talking. And then as a result, responses may seem tangental, they may seem vague or disconnected, but again this may not be at all intentional. Similarly, our symptom expression is shaped by our culture. It's shaped by our social context, it's shaped by our language. So a client's reported symptoms and their description of a particular symptom may not match what clinician's are accustomed to hearing. For example, black Americans are much more likely to talk about somatic symptoms like having headaches, having pain, gastrointestinal distress, as opposed to talking about traditional views of sadness and subjective distress. So you may both be talking about the symptoms of depression, but it doesn't map onto what the clinician is accustomed to hearing around symptoms of depression. It's also essential that clinicians understand the role of stigma and their discussion of mental illness with clients of color, particularly the stigmatizing images and messages they received within their culture and how these may impact that assessment process. As for anyone, stigmatization of mental illness prevents them, the individual as well as family members, from seeking help and clinicians need to be especially sensitive to the cultural shame that may be around the issue that they're experiencing these symptoms whatsoever. So I wish I had had enough time to infuse this video but there is a set of videos online, a series called Black People Don't, and there was a particular episode on Black People Don't Do Therapy. And what was amazing is these individuals were talking about the messages they heard growing up about therapy and about being crazy. They talked about the response they got from others if they mentioned that they had seen a counselor, even for something relatively minor. It was amazing to hear them talk about the amount of stigma they experienced, the shame they experienced, how overwhelming the experience was to share, and how silencing it was. One woman talked about a friendship of forty years, but she knew to never mention to that woman that she had seen a counselor. Never. So how does this stigma impact their social support, their relationships, and how they can talk to you about their symptoms. We know that stigmas also influenced by gender and race archetypes of black men and women, and these archetypes define the norms regarding things like emotional strain, perseverance, physical endurance. So one such image is the strong black woman archetype. This is one of those culture gender norms. This typifies black woman as being strong, capable and self-reliant. African American woman who internalize this image as their idealized goal of what they should be like frequently will self-censor behaviors that may imply weakness like say asking for help, taking a break, stopping, resting. And then given that this archetype stigmatizes the need to want and ask for help, they may also deny themselves the help they need, and you see higher rates of depression, under utilization of mental health services, and if they do attend therapy, attending fewer sessions and terminating early. "John-Henry-ism" is a counter image that refers to a cultural gender role norm that's typical for black men, and this refers to the expectation that one will actively face and plow through life's obstacles, and it's named after the fabled black man, John Henry, who challenged the steam engine and plowed through the mountain and beat the steam engine but paid for that with his life, and that he plowed through, he made his goal, he kept going, kept going to the point of death, but he did it. Endorsement of this norm has been associated with a variety of negative health outcomes among black men including some of the obvious things like depression and cardiovascular issues. Some other forms of bias that impact the diagnostic assessment and the clinical interview in particular, most of them down, or many of them come down to implicit bias. Yet this is not something most clinicians get much training about. But implicit bias refers to unconscious processes either positive or negative that involve these attitudes that we might hold to a particular person, group or particular objects. Implicit bias impacts all people, and I need to emphasize that. We're all victim to implicit bias. Implicit bias is activated without any conscious knowledge that it's happening. And this is part of why it's so dangerous and so insidious. So stereotypes we hold about different groups of people become invisible and this then impacts how we interact with that group. Studies reveal that clinician's implicit bias will predict how they diagnose the client, the diagnosis the client is likely to receive. It decreases patient comfort, their reporting of symptoms and negatively impacts their help seeking behavior and treatment compliance. Again these are all things that are happening on a subconscious level, and yet clients pick up on it and they're responding. We also know that most of the basic cultural competence training that we get doesn't address implicit bias, and it doesn't address the consequences as a result. So most cultural competence training will try to improve explicit bias. They'll try to make us more aware of stereotypes we have about different groups. Unfortunately, an increased awareness of our explicit bias is associated with increased implicit bias, and doing things like stereotype suppression, so trying to stop yourself from having the stereotypes, will actually increase implicit bias. And why is this really critically important? It's because implicit bias is what actually packs the punch in how we treat clients. So people that are outwardly "Yea I have this stereotype, I don't care," they actually tend to give pretty similar care to clients. It's the people who think they're not racist who think they don't have these stereotypes. We find that they diagnose clients differently, they are more likely to offer less beneficial treatment, they are more likely to refer a client out. So instead we need to focus on cultural competence training that's specifically designed to reduce activation of implicit bias. Now how do we do this is a little bit difficult, but some of the suggestions involve things like trying to associate minority members with other goals and values that the clinician has, like their goal of helping others, looking for common identities that allow them to join with the client. So I'm a dancer. It may be coming to find out that the client is also a dancer and being able to see their humanity and see them as a similar person because of that shared identity, and doing things to try to actively counter, gather information that actively counters any stereotypes you might have of that group. Finally another suggestion is trying perspective taking, trying to put yourself in the shoes of that person, what it might be like to be a person of color from their particular ethnic group, from their particular socioeconomic group, and how that might impact their lives. So as you might imagine, these are the kinds of activities that require personal investment in doing this work, and ongoing investment in doing this work. When we see differences in the rates of pathology across these different groups, and we're trying to understand why that's happening, it can become useful to try to figure it out. Are we talking about clinical bias, or are we talking about cultural bias? So clinical bias is the failure to adhere to diagnostic criteria appropriately, and our cultural bias refers to the misinterpretation of cultural behaviors and then interpreting them as psychopathology. What I assert is that they often go hand in hand. As one example, when you look at the behavior of newer clinicians, what you often will see is that they will engage in clinical bias as a result of their cultural bias. So their lack of training and experience with people of color and differing race groups leads them to depend on stereotypes more often, and then apply the diagnostic criteria improperly because they're activating and using their stereotypes in the process. And thankfully as clinicians become more experienced, they do this less. But that would be an example of clinical bias and cultural bias coming together. Perhaps one of the most misunderstood issues in the assessment of black Americans has to do with clinical interpretations of psychosis, paranoia and cultural mistrust. Black patients who report symptoms of psychosis are at far greater risk of being diagnosed and misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia than are white patients. One study even found that as many as 86% of black patients with bipolar disorder were misdiagnosed originally as having schizophrenia. Research shows that non-black clinicians will frequently over rely on psychotic symptoms when they're assessing black Americans and attribute those psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia instead of looking more broadly. In essence, they focus too heavily on psychosis when there aren't any psychotic symptoms at all, and underestimate the value and the severity of effective symptoms that might imply that they have a mood disorder with psychosis. What's really interesting about this, the way that we really can solidly know that this is about bias is that when you give clinicians all of the same information but you do not allow them to know the race of the client, this almost completely disappears. So in essence if they don't know that they're talking about a black patient, suddenly they appropriately consider the psychotic symptoms but they give appropriate weight also to effective symptoms and they're more likely to consider psychotic disorders as well as mood disorders with psychotic symptoms. So you might imagine if clinicians do this badly when they're dealing with actual psychosis, you can only imagine the kind of challenges they face when they're trying to examine clients that may be endorsing more ambiguous symptoms of paranoia. And the research shows that without having any training on this, and without any conscious effort to recognize it, clinicians actually do an incredibly poor job at distinguishing between cultural mistrust and paranoia. And instead, it can contribute to mislabelling black patients as having pathological levels of paranoia and psychosis. In a series of studies on this topic, Arthur Waley and his colleagues demonstrated that several measures of paranoia and psychotic delusions place black Americans at or above clinical cutoffs for pathology. But when you actually look at the items, there's some question about what are we really getting at here. So these three items, I sometimes feel I'm being followed, I hear the laughter already, how often have you felt that people were trying to cheat you, how often have you felt that your thoughts were being taken away from you by an external source. When you are testing white Americans, these items are great predictors of paranoia. The problem is they appear to have differential validity in the assessment for clinical paranoia and pathology for black Americans. And in truth, at least these first two items appear to reflect more of a healthy level of paranoia that we refer to as cultural mistrust and may actually reflect that they are very much cognizant of reality and what's happening in the world and that they can acknowledge discrimination that's perpetrated against black people and perhaps events that have happened to them personally. So all of these items would result in an elevated paranoia score, but if you look at the content, it's really only the third one that really and truly seems to touch on psychosis versus a cultural mistrust. When clinicians are aware of this, it turns out they can actually do a very good job in distinguishing between appropriate diagnosis and they can very perfectly figure out whether or not they're looking at cultural mistrust of pathological levels of paranoia. So they do a good job of this but the issue is they have to be aware that they need to do this, and this is where things break down. So to adequately address cultural mistrust in diagnostic assessment, Waley and Colleagues suggested that clinicians need to take responsibility for having direct discussions of cultural mistrust, and I emphasize that clinicians need to take responsibility for this, because the reality is when we have people of color that come to our offices, they often are not going to know if it is acceptable to bring these conversations to the table. So the clinicians need to be the one to kind of do that work and let the client know that that's okay to have that discussion. They also suggest that we actively incorporate measures of cultural mistrust when we're assessing pathology among black Americans, especially if there's any hint that we may be dealing with paranoia or psychosis. We need to be able to weed these two concepts apart. And third, we need to be responsible in only using measures and tests of paranoia that have been appropriately vetted for black Americans. So in addition to discussing healthy cultural mistrust in our clinical interviews, it's also suggested that clinicians perform collaborative assessments that focus on issues like resilience and positive coping in addition to simply assessing pathology, and one way of doing this is using the DSM's cultural formulation interview, the CFI. The CFI is a brief semi-structured interview. It allows clinicians to systematically assess for cultural influences in the individual's life, things that are relevant to their symptoms and into their progress with treatment. It helps the clinician understand how the patient's current mental health status relates to and is influenced by social and cultural context as well as history. The CFI is person centered and tried to directly elicit information and feedback from the client about their own perception of the world, as well as the perception of important others in their life. Now although this is considered a really quite essential piece of assessment when you're talking about black Americans and people of color, the reality is that this is being recommended as a formal part of our assessments with all people because all people are going to be coming from a particular context where having this kind of information is useful in understanding their pathology. If you can read this, this is an excerpt from the CFI, as you can see this format, the format of the CFI is very similar to that of the structured clinical interview for the DSM, meaning that on one side of the page, you have text that's designed to guide you to the flavor of the information you're trying to collect, and then on the other side you have specific questions that you use to help explore and probe each domain. So to go through the example, what brings you here today? I have spells. I have spells where I'm just gone, I don't respond to anyone, and sometimes I just fall out. Well your goal there is to then figure out how is it that that person understands their experience, how they talk about the experience, and how that may be different from another person. So you might then ask them, well people talk about these in different ways, how might you describe this problem? And generally, you would use the same words they use. How would you describe these spells and when you're falling out? Well when I talk to other people, I tell them I'm just tired, I just kind of fall asleep with my eyes open. And you go through this process and you also follow up with things like how is it that their family talks about it, or what do they see as the number one problem with this. The client might answer something like well my grandma believes that this is root work, or some who do and that the devil is able to get to me because i didn't pray hard enough. What's important about this is it's telling you how language, how they use language in understanding their symptoms, what they understand to be the causes of their symptoms, what problems they see involved in their symptoms, how other important members of their family and community understand their symptoms. This might give you insight into issues of stigma and shame, you know the idea that she wasn't praying hard enough and her grandmother thinks in essence it's her fault then. For time, I'm going to go through some of this quickly but some of the goals of the CFI are to help you understand different categories of identity and to think about the person as a representation of multiple categories of identity or intersecting identities. It helps you understand their understanding of why people get sick, what sickness is about, what cures it, what causes it. It helps you identify the things that they see as psychosocial stressors instead of what we might identify. It also helps understand and elicit information about what are the ways in which they can successfully cope. It also allows you to understand what factors that are cultural and now help them to become more resilient and help them cope positively, identify relationship issues between the clinician and the client, like transference and counter transference, and then end with an overall statement that wraps up all of this very briefly. In the end, what it will allow you to do is have a better understanding of how culture's infused in this diagnostic assessment, how it may be impacting the symptoms you see. Now although the CFI's been found to be useful across a number of circumstances with a variety of patients regardless of the kind of institution or setting they're in, it's especially useful when you're trying to conduct a difficult diagnostic assessment where there's differences between the clinician and the client, when the clinician might be uncertain of the fit between the kinds of symptoms that have a cultural flair that the patient is talking about and not sure exactly how that fits in to the DSM criteria, if they're having difficulty judging illness severity or the impairment, or if they're trying to understand what community resources they can draw on to help the client. So in addition to using the CFI for the assessment as already mentioned, there are some other important considerations that the empirical literature identifies. One, when we see clients that are regularly relapsing or they're not improving, despite the best treatments, this is an important time to reconsider diagnosis and do a new assessment, especially if the client came to the table with anything related to psychosis 'cause this tends to be particularly poorly identified for black Americans. Included in that are things lie bipolar disorder, depression, post traumatic stress, that just somehow keep getting missed when you're talking about black clients. It's also important to understand that many black Americans have fairly complicated physical health concerns and some chronic conditions and there are certain things that just disproportionately affect black clients like hypertension and diabetes. These things are more common in a black community. They also result in greater disease and morbidity for black Americans, so an assessment of their psychological well being has to consider and address what's going on with their physical health and what it's like to chronically manage these kind of conditions. Black Americans also face several social challenges that may impact diagnostic assessment and the treatment process. One thing that is commonly overlooked is the disproportionate number of adult black women to adult black men. This is a psychosocial stressor that impacts family stability, economic stability, and is found to have a dramatic impact on sexual health decision making for women. A second piece of this disproportionate number of black men and women as adults, and they didn't start out that way. There is actually more black boys born, but by adulthood, the numbers are vastly different. This reflects a history, a legacy that involves violence, death. disease, trauma, a variety of social stress, and it impacts the assessment and diagnostic process for the individual and the entire community. So the sources of bias that I've discussed here and our efforts to reduce their impact on diagnosis and assessment are only a handful of the many potential options that we have in addressing the limitations and assessment for black Americans. They offer us a starting point but they by now means offer us an ending point in how we address bias in our assessment process. As clinicians, perhaps our best weapon is that we each have to do our own work to address bias in our research as well as our clinical work with clients of all demographic backgrounds. As we bring to light our own bias, our explicit bias as well as our implicit bias, and we take responsibility for changing our standard practices so that we are more culturally sensitive, we have the ability to make great strides in reducing mental health disparities in the United States.

NICOLE BUCHANAN So we have three minutes if anybody has brief questions right now, but I'll also remind you that we are going to have an entire discussion that's dedicated just to this portion of the morning later on, so you have burning issues you don't get to talk about. Any questions? 

00:53:00
[sil.] 

00:53:05
NICOLE BUCHANAN Yes. 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN Is it that cultural formulation that now gets applied by suggesting, is it making a big difference in the cultural competence of the clinicians? 

00:53:15
NICOLE BUCHANAN So there are a couple ways. The cultural formulation interview was originally introduced in DSM 4, but it's been revamped for DSM 5 so it has greater empirical evidence that it's useful and acceptable to clients, that they're finding it useful and they're accepting it. They do have evidence but it's still relatively new, but they do have evidence that it improves diagnostic accuracy, it improves the rapport between the clinician and client which has direct impact on things like treatment outcome, staying in treatment, and early termination. 

00:53:55

00:54:05
UNKNOWN You've done a great job of providing a survey of the key issues. One of the points that you made was you have equal representation or representation as a particular group or national norms for example, some folks think that that's fine. You're saying that that's not fine because it's only a subgroup than saying much about the difficulty and norms for the individual that was in that. Is that correct? 

00:54:30
NICOLE BUCHANAN Yes. So when we, oh, I'm sorry. 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN Should we have, particularly in regard to African Americans, should we have black norms or testing, and if you do, what black root African American norm should we use? 

00:54:50
NICOLE BUCHANAN Thank you for that question. So the question is if, in essence part of the question is how far do we go with this having norms for specific groups, if we know that when you just have a proportion represented that equals the US population, we know that that's now going to have enough influence in changing the scoring norms on a particular test, so do we go to having black norms? I think can be actually quite useful, especially when we see that there are measures that don't have the same predictive validity for different groups. Now the second piece of that question is a little more difficult. How finally do we slice this, so do we have norms for black Caribbeans, do we have norms for those born in the US, those that are at least four generations born within the US. How do, I don't know. Having the norms that at least are identified by race would be a huge improvement for most measures. There's also been some backlash as many of you may realize, the MMPI no longer encourages that you have gender, different gender norms, in scoring the MMPI, so the move towards this is actually gone backwards. But I think there's usefulness in having a sense of how do typically functioning individuals from a particular cultural background score for this particular test and does this particular client score outside of that norm? Okay so we are out of time for questions, but again if you do have any questions, we're going to have an entire discussion hour available to do so. And I would like to introduce...
