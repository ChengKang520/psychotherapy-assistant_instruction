00:00:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you so much for coming this morning. I appreciate that very much. My name is Michael Yapko. I will be doing a demonstration of clinical hypnosis in just a little while. I want to speak for just a few minutes to put into some kind of perspective, some kind of meaningful frame what hypnosis is about and why bother with hypnosis and what is that hypnosis affords as a therapeutic tool that justifies its use. Well, I have spent now more than 30 years of my professional life studying hypnosis intensively, writing about hypnosis intensively, using hypnosis in a wide variety of clinical applications. And I have continued to maintain a level of enthusiasm for hypnosis that is remarkable for me. It is a driving passion, it is such an interesting phenomenon to me how I can talk with someone, introduce some ideas and some possibilities in ways that I hope will help engage the person, focus the person, and elicit responses from the person that they find beneficial. And the fact that hypnosis has such a strong empirical base is a relatively recent phenomenon with the call for greater empirical validation, but hypnosis has certainly lived up to the challenge and I think in many ways even exceeded what people would expect. So the fact that there is a great empirical base is wonderful. But honestly that's not what your clients care about. Your clients don't really care about what's going on in the brain and which parts of the brain are more active. And what they're really interested in is, what can you say, what can you do that will make a difference as quickly as possible. And in that sense hypnosis isn't a therapy in and of itself. I know people use the term hypnotherapy and it's not that I object to that term, it just doesn't say anything. All it says is that you're doing hypnosis and of course one person doing hypnosis isn't using it in the same way that somebody else might, which isn't the same way that somebody else might. In that respect you're sort of learning a language and you'll end up using that language, expressing yourself in your own unique and idiosyncratic way. But what clients tend to care about is how can I make this transition from this state of distress that I'm in now into some other way of experiencing myself that is less symptom bound, less rigid, less hurtful. Now the idea of using a relationship with someone and using social influence patterns to actually change the way someone sees something is the reason that we're all in this. And that's what the field of hypnosis has been studying intensively now in a real research-oriented basis since the 1930s when Clark Hull introduced the first research paradigm for doing hypnosis. And hypnosis has a long rich tradition of many, many famous and not so famous people who've continued to move the field forward. But the more that we learn about the social psychology of the clinical relationship, the more relevant hypnosis becomes. The more interested you are and how your therapy works, whatever it is you do, the more relevant hypnosis becomes. You'll notice how many people at this wonderful conference that we're at are talking about the merits of focusing, the merits of mindfulness, the merits of meditation, the merits of experiential learning. And I don't know of any clinical literature that is as rich and is as descriptive as the hypnosis literature simply because it's been around the longest. Hypnosis could even be termed the original positive psychology. Literally in the 1930s and 1940s Milton Erickson was talking about the importance of focusing on people's strengths because the very first principle of hypnosis is this one, what you focus on, you amplify, what you focus on, you amplify. And that's really the question that the positive psychology movement has asked, and I think it's the right question to ask, that when we've spent a century focusing on what's wrong with people, are we better off as a result. But we've certainly learned a lot. The study of psychopathology has hardly been an exercise in futility. We've learned a lot. But there's a lot to be said for learning about what's right with people, how to identify and mobilize their strengths, their assets, their virtues. And I think for anyone who does hypnosis, for anyone who does hypnosis, they start out with that idea that people have more resources than they realize. And so contrary to the popular mythology about hypnosis that somehow hypnosis is gonna take people's power away, hypnosis is the exact opposite, how do you empower people by connecting them with their own resources, and I hope that that's not just something I'm saying now in a theoretical sort of way. I'm hoping, hoping that this will be something I can demonstrate adequately in the course of this demonstration hour. The time tends to go by very quickly. You never really know what's going to happen. But certainly I would hope that as you watch me do this session, as you listen to the things that I say, as you listen to the things my partner says in this process that you'll see some positive psychology and operation as I'm looking for strengths, looking for resources, looking for things that I can use to help this person develop their inner resources. Now I came into this demonstration hour as I always come into demonstration hours, which is not knowing who my partner's going to be. Let me give you some self selection criteria first before the hand start to go up. First, obviously whatever problem that you're going to present to me, it would be nice if it was a relatively circumscribed one. Now is not the time to talk about your personality disorder. Secondly, it's gotta be a problem that you feel comfortable talking about in front of strangers and not just the people here in this room, but the people who are going to be watching this DVD in years to come. So it's gotta be something that you feel comfortable talking about. Third, it's not necessary, but would certainly be nice if you've had some kind of focusing experience, whether it's meditative, hypnotic or otherwise. That would be helpful. Fourth, if you had previously volunteered at other conferences and congresses, I'd prefer that you not volunteer for this one. I'd really like to work with somebody and give somebody else a chance basically, give somebody else a chance to have this quality of experience that you've already had and been able to benefit from. And so with those self selection criteria in place, anybody that wants to volunteer to do a session? Okay, right. I can barely see, but -- okay, I see this woman here in the third row. So come on up. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Now you're gonna be asked to sign your life away before you come up on this stage. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:09:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Obviously, she's agreeing to be videotaped, she's agreeing to sign the rights to the Erickson Foundation as the producer of this DVD. She's also unwittingly taking over my car payments. By the time she realizes it, it'll be too late. So... 

00:10:10
[sil.] 

00:10:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi, I'm Michael. 

00:10:15
KARY  Kary. 

00:10:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Kary? 

00:10:20
KARY Yeah. 

00:10:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice to meet you Kary. If you'd have a seat there. You're gonna to have to wrestle with this a little bit to get the microphone on. But that can sit on your lap perhaps. Let me help you with that. You arrange it in a way that's comfortable. Does that work for you? 

00:10:40
KARY I think so. 

00:10:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, great. Get all these cords out of here. Okay. What would you like help with? 

00:10:55
KARY I am finishing medical training and did graduate school prior, so I keep finding myself sticking in school and blocking on getting to the stage of performing in the sense of writing, doing research, and doing more speaking because I'm usually terrified to be in front of groups. So I'm doing desensitization today at the same time. 

00:11:15
MICHAEL YAPKO  Congratulations. For someone who is so uncomfortable in front of groups, here you are. How did you do that? 

00:11:25
KARY  I think, call into my meditation practice. I am just saying I can come up here and be centered and there's lights. I can't really see them and it just feels like a supportive environment. 

00:11:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Let me move this wire for just a second. So when you told yourself that you could do this. Oh, I'm sorry. The wire is hanging off your face, I want you to move it. Okay. So when you tell yourself that you can use your meditative practice to do this, how does that -- how did you tell in yourself that make it possible? 

00:12:00
KARY  I think it was the encouragement of my seat mate as well. 

00:12:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Are you're going to blame her, you know. 

00:12:10
KARY Yeah. She was interested in doing. And so I said okay, if she can do it, I can do it. 

00:12:15
MICHAEL YAPKO She can do it, I can do it. 

00:12:15
KARY And just putting myself in a more centered posture. 

00:12:15
MICHAEL YAPKO  Okay. 

00:12:20
KARY I don't know why mine's are not working like yours? 

00:12:20
MICHAEL YAPKO I've got tucked into... 

00:12:20
KARY Okay. 

00:12:20
MICHAEL YAPKO My pocket there. So, all right. 

00:12:25
KARY Keeps sliding, but... 

00:12:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

00:12:30
KARY I'll will just try not to move. Where does this go? 

00:12:35
MICHAEL YAPKO This is the first challenge, doesn't it? 

00:12:40
KARY It is. Okay. 

00:12:40
MICHAEL YAPKO You set? 

00:12:40
KARY  Yeah. 

00:12:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. All right. All right. So the way that you introduced it was you're now going through medical training and you're thinking that the next logical step will be doing research, doing some writing. 

00:12:55
KARY Right. 

00:12:55
MICHAEL YAPKO That's ultimately what you want to be able to do. 

00:12:55
KARY And I did it in the past as part of graduate school, but for somewhere along the path in the training that feels like I've gotten more stuck in -- in where to start, like what is -- how do I even do this and perfectionism catches me. 

00:13:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Tell me more about that. 

00:13:15
KARY  I used to be a lot more perfectionistic, and so I would just drive myself hard, but with the meditative practice I feel I have more balance now. And so there is not -- it's -- I'm not doing it to please others anymore, and so I lost that motivation, and now it's trying to find a new motivation and feeling like I have enough to actually offer to say that it would be worthwhile to say it. 

00:13:45
MICHAEL YAPKO  How would you know if you had something worthwhile to say? 

00:13:50
KARY  Other people tell me I do and they tell me I need to start speaking up and doing more writing. 

00:14:00
MICHAEL YAPKO So what is it that they know that you don't? 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:10
KARY I guess they see me from the outside and I must be caught still in some insecurities on the inside that my self-evaluation isn't as... 

00:14:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. The question I really asked that was clearly they're seeing something that leads them to believe you have something worthwhile to say. I'm curious how do they evaluate what you have to say in a way that's different than how you evaluate, what you have to say? 

00:14:40
KARY  It's people who've been in my women's groups or in professional relationship with me that have heard me talking already or have read things that I've written previously -- are written. So they're basing it on samples of stuff that they've already seen. 

00:15:00
MICHAEL YAPKO So they're saying because you had something to say before, it's likely that you'll have something to say again? 

00:15:05
KARY I think so. 

00:15:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And that perspective is enough for them to suggest you that you get going. Why isn't it enough for you? 

00:15:15
KARY I sit down and I just feel frozen. It's like I don't know where to start and I don't know how to start, even though I've written in the past. I don't know which material to start with. And it's just this complete and total block and I find excuses of thousand other things to do, don't create time, fill it with other things. And I'd -- it's being going on for a couple of years. 

00:15:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. So when you have multiple possible starting places, how do you decide which one to start with? 

00:15:50
KARY  I don't know. I mean I think I just need to pick one and do it. 

00:16:00
MICHAEL YAPKO  Alright. So the -- throw a dart at it and see which one it lands on? 

00:16:05
KARY  That sort of feels like I keep starting each one a little bit and then say, no, no, no, that -- that one doesn't feel right and I push it aside and then I start another one, and I've been repeating the pattern for too long. 

00:16:20
MICHAEL YAPKO How do other people in a similar position, people who have multiple projects that they could pursue, how do other people do this? How do they decide which is going to be their focal point? 

00:16:35
KARY It seems like usually it's the one with the closest deadline. 

00:16:40
MICHAEL YAPKO  I am sorry, how did you? 

00:16:45
KARY The one with the closest deadline that drives the priority list and none of mine have deadlines. 

00:16:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. So the person who lives by the philosophy that if it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done? 

00:16:55
KARY Hmmm. 

00:16:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Alright. So when people don't have deadlines, how do they choose? 

00:17:00
KARY  What they like the most, what's calling them the most, what they feel most passionate about. 

00:17:10
MICHAEL YAPKO  Alright. And when you're in the position then of evaluating different possibilities, are you aware of any of them being any more inspiring than the other? 

00:17:25
KARY Yes. 

00:17:25
MICHAEL YAPKO And then what happens? 

00:17:25
KARY  The ones I'm most passionate about seem to be the ones that bring up the most fear. 

00:17:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. So even when you're able to decide where you want to focus, now the next is dealing with the fear that goes with it. 

00:17:45
KARY Hmmm. 

00:17:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Tell me about the fear. 

00:17:45
KARY  It's -- you know, I'm not gonna do this right or not enough -- I'm trying to dig into what it feels like when I'm actually sitting before it. I'm aware of actually a fear of doing it well. As also that that comes up like, then there might be expectation for more or maybe I'd have to do public speaking or something and be in front of groups, and that brings up more fears. 

00:18:25
MICHAEL YAPKO  And how would someone kidnap you and force you to do that? 

00:18:30
KARY  They wouldn't. Would be -- I'd still have the opportunity to turn it down. I'm sure. This is -- one second. That's any better? Okay. 

00:18:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Alright. So you tell yourself that you would in fact have some control over it. You could say yes I'd like to take that on or no I wouldn't like to take that on. Why doesn't that seem to settle the fear for you? 

00:19:10
KARY Because I wanna take it on. But it still brings up -- there is fear and excitement that sits side by side. 

00:19:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Alright. Now you mentioned that you've had experience with meditation. Have you had experience with hypnosis before? 

00:19:30
KARY No. 

00:19:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. So when you do meditation, what exactly do you do? 

00:19:35
KARY  I took a year off during part of my medical training inside a couple or two-month retreats in the Posner tradition. 

00:19:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

00:19:45
KARY Yeah. 

00:19:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. 

00:19:45
KARY And so that was about year-and-a-half ago and I've been just -- a Buddhist sitting practice for about nine years. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Really? 

00:19:55
KARY Yeah. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. So when you're meditating, can you describe the experience for me or the process there for me? 

00:20:00
KARY I've done different types, a lot of it is just sitting kind of in an open awareness and either focusing on breath, maybe sounds, body sensations. Other times I've the done practices called Brahma Viharas where it's a loving kindness practice or a compassion practice. 

00:20:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. 

00:20:20
KARY  And so I've spent -- I did two months in that frame of just reciting five phrases for two months. 

00:20:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Can you remember what they are? 

00:20:35
KARY I can. 

00:20:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Just joking. Bad joke, sorry. Alright. So using that experience as a base, the ability to focus yourself, the ability to talk to yourself in a way that's meaningful is what I'd like to be able to expand on... 

00:20:50
KARY  Okay. 

00:20:55
MICHAEL YAPKO In this process, alright. So if you're ready to began, then I'd suggest you arrange yourself in a position that's comfortable. Great. And then you can do what you know how to do quite well in terms of starting to focus yourself. Now given that you have literally years of experience in being able to use your thoughts in a directed way that you've grown comfortable with the language of compassion, kindness, that counts for a lot because certainly as you've discovered over the years your ability to focus yourself is one of the greatest strengths that you can possibly develop in being able to create in yourself a level of physical comfort that might surprise even you and to create in yourself a quality of absorption that might well delight you when you move it in a new direction. And here you are seeking out a new experience and I always appreciate, I literally always appreciate when someone is willing to step out of their comfort zone the way that you have, the way that anyone who is fundamentally growth-oriented eventually learns to do. It's such a curious thing to me that people kind of get the sequencing wrong. They think they should feel comfortable before they take a risk. And I have to remind them taking a risk necessarily produces at least some concern. But when you take a sensible risk and you discover abilities to manage it just as you're discovering now that you can slow your breathing down, you can allow your thoughts to grow quieter. And even in this novel situation you find yourself in... 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:40
MICHAEL YAPKO You're discovering a new application of things you already know quite well. 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:26:00
MICHAEL YAPKO And so using your curiosity. 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, isn't that what every explorer does? 

00:26:20
[sil.] 

00:26:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Isn't that why research matters to you? There's a question you want to attempt to answer. And when someone starts a research project where you're allowed to have hunches... 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:27:00
MICHAEL YAPKO You're allowed to have educated guesses and you still take safeguards to protect the data from contamination because much is, is humanly possible. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:30
MICHAEL YAPKO That's what it means to be an explorer. It means not knowing what you're going to find, but trusting yourself to manage it, to handle it. And if you think about it Kary, it's what you've done your whole life. When you take a year off to study meditative practices... 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:20
MICHAEL YAPKO You can start with a general idea of how you think it'll contribute to your life, your well-being, your effectiveness as a doctor, or researcher, a person. But there was no way for you to know the specifics. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:00
MICHAEL YAPKO But you trusted yourself to walk into a totally novel situation and rely on your ability to recognize what needs to be said, what needs to be done. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:35
MICHAEL YAPKO How important it is to know to really know... 

00:29:45
[sil.] 

00:29:50
MICHAEL YAPKO ...that comfort doesn't come from avoiding possibilities. Comfort doesn't come from trying to find a safe place to hang out. Comfort comes from knowing your deeper self. That's right. Nice deep breath of knowing, which resources to reach inside yourself and find and bring forth to handle a particular situation well and when you're doing that 25 times a day or more of being able to walk away from a situation saying to yourself, I like what I did there, I liked the way I handled that. That's how comfort grows. But I've spent a lifetime professionally, listening to people describe to me. How much they like to do and how much they hate doing other peoples thinking for them. A 47-year-old woman I treated not long ago, where after 25 years of marriage, her husband split to Rio with his secretary, she was annoyed. And dealing with the aftermath the hurt, the loss, the anger. Eventually the conversation over months turned to now what her friends were telling her that she should start dating and when I asked her about that she had this look of sheer horror on her face. When she told me that she can't date because she has stretch marks from the kids. I couldn't really get the point across to her right away, but she got it eventually that she is not the one who decides, whether she's attractive. She is not the one who decides, whether she's worth dating. And then I saw a man 68 years old, who lost his job two years before retirement and he was devastated. And his friends were telling him that he really should go out and look for work, coz he was still young, vital and he dismissed it by saying well, who's going to hire me at my age. And I had to tell him what you would have probably told him too. How about if you put in the job application and let them decide whether they want to hire you or not. Well, he's working more hours then he wants to right now. And she's dated too many turkeys, but isn't that interesting. And there's something that you're learning Kary, a very important learning. And I can articulate it for you, but I'd really much rather you articulate it for yourself. And when you know what that learning is or why not say it out loud. 

00:36:15
[sil.] 

00:36:25
MICHAEL YAPKO That's right. 

00:36:30
KARY A phrase comes to mind and it's that I just need to follow my bliss. 

00:36:35
MICHAEL YAPKO  Just need to follow your bliss, whether it has stretch marks or not. Whether at times it seems a little old or not. Would you agree? 

00:36:55
KARY  

00:37:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, I like that phrase, follow your bliss. And I think I would have said the same thing in a slightly different way that while you're following your bliss. You really don't know what someone else is thinking about it. How someone else is judging it. Whether they like the stretch marks or not. Doesn't really change the bliss much does it. 

00:37:50
KARY  

00:37:55
MICHAEL YAPKO So when you absorb yourself in making a choice, 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:10
MICHAEL YAPKO ..it was interesting to me. When I asked you the question, how do you choose? How do other people choose? You didn't say anything about the bliss factor and I'm really wondering how much bliss there'll be when you're analyzing data. 

00:38:55
KARY Probably not a lot that day. 

00:38:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Not that day. But in the days that follow. When the drudgery turns to passion because there's something important to say. When you get to the discussion part of the article and even the suggestions for future research that you yourself might well carry out. 

00:39:35
[sil.] 

00:39:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, how many times have you heard your professors critic or research project. How many times have you heard a professor say this is the perfect piece of research. And isn't it amazing how many imperfect pieces of research have inspired your desire to do research. And so it really just needs to be imperfect enough to say something meaningful. Imperfect enough to be inspiring. Imperfect enough that your professors are sharing your data with students while critiquing it. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
MICHAEL YAPKO That's a curious thing. When you find yourself having two different sets of feelings, how you get to choose, you get to choose, which one to respond to. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
MICHAEL YAPKO There's always some anxiety around doing something new being some place new, experiencing something new. 

00:41:45
[sil.] 

00:41:50
MICHAEL YAPKO And at the same time there's a deep sense of curiosity. And when you find yourself somehow gravitating effortlessly to the curiosity, you can easily envision a time when someone asks you that seemed a risky thing to do, how did you do it? and reflexively find yourself saying a combination of curiosity and wanting to follow my bliss. And they may being at fully understand it. You may not fully understand it, but what you discover is how the perfectionism of the past has been overtaken by the curiosity about the future. The earnestness of wanting to know, the intensity of having to know. 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:45
MICHAEL YAPKO And the fact that you might even choose to study something that others consider off the beaten path. Well isn't that what curiosity is about? To find what strays from the norm, the usual, the obvious. 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And to go beyond that to the places that aren't yet on the map or the map simply says here there'd be dragons, that's the driving curiosity. 

00:44:55

MICHAEL YAPKO Now just a moment carry I'm going to check in with you a little about, what you're aware of and you can continue to be wonderfully comfortable. Speaking even as you deepen your comfort with each word you say, but if you can tell me a little bit about what you're aware of right now. 

00:45:35
KARY  You're voice, ah, the surface of my foot on the ground, once in a while awareness of a lot of people being in the room, I'm feeling my body on the chair really broad opening through my chest, it's not a pressure, but it just feels relaxed and open. 

00:46:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. 

00:46:10
KARY My heart rate's gone down a lot. I'm not even noticing this thing on my head. And I just, I feel a peace. 

00:46:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

00:46:30
KARY And the words that just keep replaying that you said is the replacement of perfectionism with curiosity, my mind just keeps replaying those words. 

00:46:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. Feels good. Doesn't it? On so many different levels, I'm really impressed with how many different levels of awareness you can have at the same time and give voice too. And I was really curious about how you're abilities would serve you here. And for me that's one of the great curiosities I have about hypnosis and these kinds of experiences. How people discover abilities in themselves and how they rediscover abilities in themselves. Deep awareness’s, profound strengths and a remarkable capacity to absorb what's meaningful. Coz long after this session's over there will be countless opportunities you have in the rest of your professional life and in your personal life as well where you find yourself at a fork in the road, a cross road, whether to go back where it's into perfectionism, whether to go forward into curiosity. And when you find that phrase repeating through your mind over and over that adds, so well to the other five that have guided you so nicely. Well, all I can ask is that you send me a reprint. 

00:49:25

00:49:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And so Kary you can consolidate, absorb, and integrate in the deepest places within you what curiosity feels like, looks like. 

00:50:00
[sil.] 

00:50:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Intensified and mobilized. So then in a little while you can bring this experience to a comfortable close, bringing back with you and maintaining within you the depths of possibility for all the things that you can do in following your bliss in a new way. And then when you've had enough time to bring this experiences to a comfortable close, then you can start the process of slowly re-orienting yourself at a rate that's gradual and easy. Slowly, methodically, re-orienting yourself until in just a moment or two, you're fully able to re-orient letting your eyes open, whenever you're ready, take your time letting your eyes open as you re-orient. 

00:51:50
[sil.] 

00:52:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi. 

00:52:05
KARY I definitely don't feel anything like I did at the beginning, just with this many people. There's a inner sensation when you're talking about letting curiosity consolidate that feels like it kind of took over in the body and I'm not aware where perfectionism resides right now. 

00:52:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Keep it handy. It'll serve you well. Any other comments or observations about the experience? 

00:52:45
KARY  It was a lot easier than I expected and when you actually pointed at me, I was like, What was I thinking? 

00:52:55
MICHAEL YAPKO What was I thinking? 

00:53:00
KARY My hand was shaking so bad I'm not sure I was even writing my address correctly, so I might have to look at that piece of paper. 

00:53:05
MICHAEL YAPKO You did phenomenally well and I appreciate that very, very much, thank you. 

00:53:10
KARY Yeah, thank you for this opportunity. 

00:53:15
MICHAEL YAPKO My pleasure. Would you be willing to respond to any questions from people here. 

00:53:20
KARY Sure. 

00:53:20
MICHAEL YAPKO That'll be alright. 

00:53:20
KARY Yeah. 

00:53:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. We only have literally three minutes so that's probably all of one question or maybe two, but if there are any questions to go to other microphones here, are there microphones in the aisle way. I can't see anything with the lights on my face, so forgive me. Okay. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN  I'm curious how you... 

00:53:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Where are you? 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN Right here. How you would have proceeded differently had she not had such a deep meditation practice? 

00:54:00
MICHAEL YAPKO How would the process... 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN How would you have proceeded had she not been so adept at going into the meditative state? 

00:54:05
MICHAEL YAPKO  Okay. Good question. One of the distinctions that I make is between formal hypnosis and informal hypnosis. So formal hypnosis where the person identifies the person, identifies the experience as hypnotically based meditation imagery any of those kinds of things. Informal hypnosis the person would say no I've never had any of those kinds of experiences, but even if somebody says no I've never had experience with hypnosis does that mean in fact that they've really never had experience with hypnosis. They've had those experiences, they just don't label them that way. So if you start to describe then routine everyday experiences that are hypnotically based getting absorbed in reading a book, getting absorbed in watching a movie, driving with you know, so called highway hypnosis where you're driving in your own automatic and you don't really remember how you even got where you've just gotten to. So I would use those kinds of experiences as the experiential base that I would build on in doing the induction process. Okay. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN Do you have time for another question? Over here to your right. here. 

00:55:25
MICHAEL YAPKO This right or that right. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN This way. You're looking at right direction. 

00:55:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Oh, there you are, okay. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN  Okay. I just wondered if these days do you tape these sessions would you tape something like this or record it in some way for the client listen to it again? 

00:55:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you for that question. I tape, I record 100% of the sessions that I do. There is never a time when I do hypnosis session that I don't record it and it's for a variety of reasons. All of sudden, this is acting out on me. First of all, I say tape digital voice recorders and making CDs for clients is such an easy thing to do, but I can promise you when Kary listens if she listens, but assuming she does, when Kary listens to this session again I promise you she will hear things where she'll go I don't remember I'm saying that, when did he say that. And each time the person listens to they get something else from it and I want them to have that experience of continually gleaning more and more from each particular session. Now common sense dictates that, but what's interesting is now just in the last three years there have been a number of studies asking that exact question that if you record sessions and have the client review them, does that have make any kind of a difference in the overall efficacy of the therapy and the answer is yes, when sessions are recorded, when clients are given the session to review, the quality of the therapy is improved, the rate of the therapy is improved as well as the quality of the efficaciousness of the therapy. So I am a huge fan of recording each and every session. Thanks for your question. Kary you deserve a big round of applause for volunteering to do this. So thank you so much. 

00:57:15
KARY Thanks. 

00:57:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. Thank you for coming everybody. I hope you found that you...
