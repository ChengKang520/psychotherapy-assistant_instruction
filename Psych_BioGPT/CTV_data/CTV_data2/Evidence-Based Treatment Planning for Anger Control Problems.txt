Evidence-Based Treatment Planning for Anger Control Problems 

00:00:30
NARRATOR The following is a presentation of John Wiley and Sons. It's part of an informative series about empirically informed treatment planning. This program focuses on anger control problems. 

00:00:40
Timothy J. Bruce Ph.D., Arthur E. Jongsma, Jr. Ph.D. 

00:00:45
DR. ART JONGSMA Hello and welcome. I'm Art Jongsma and joining me is my colleague, Dr. Tim Bruce. Together, we're going to discuss with you empirically informed treatment planning for anger control problems. 

00:00:55
Modules Define Anger and Anger Control Problems Essential Elements of Treatment Planning Brief History of the EST Movement Empirically Informing a Treatment Plan for Anger Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention Evidence-based Treatment Plan for Anger Control Problems 

00:01:00
DR. TIM BRUCE This program is broken into a number of modules. In it, we'll define anger and anger control problems, discuss the essential elements of the treatment planning process, provide a brief history of the movement to identify empirically supported treatments, or ESTs. We'll then show how to empirically inform a treatment plan with findings from the EST literature on anger control problems. We'll spend some time discussing common considerations in relapse prevention and present an example of an evidence-based treatment plan for anger control problems. 

00:01:30
DR. ART JONGSMA Before we get started, one thing should be noted: the purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a treatment plan for anger control problems can be empirically informed by incorporating goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with those of identified ESTs and with evidence-based practice guidelines. You'll also see brief scenarios that demonstrate aspects of the EST interventions described. 

00:02:00
DR. TIM BRUCE It's important to note that these scenarios are selected examples of the ESTs and don't represent delivery of any one of them in their entirety. Our program is are designed to be educational in nature and is not intended to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about these types of therapies, references to their empirical support, clinical resources, and training opportunities can be found in the companion workbook to this DVD. 

00:02:30
Defining Anger and Anger Control Problems 

00:02:30
DR. TIM BRUCE We're going to begin by defining anger and anger control problems. 

00:02:35
DR. ART JONGSMA Unlike other mental health problems discussed in this series that represent diagnosable mental health disorders, conceptualization and treatment planning for anger control problems is not facilitated greatly by diagnostic classification systems such as the DSM. The DSM recognizes several disorders in which problematic affect, or mood, cause clinically significant distress, disability, or both. For example, anxiety disorders involve anxiety reactions an avoidant behavior that distress or disable the client. Depression involves sadness, loss of interest, and withdrawal that do the same. Yet for those who react to situations with strong, maladaptive anger, there is no parallel anger disorder. 

00:03:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Although DSM recognizes intermittent explosive disorder, it's a rare condition and characterized by aggressive episodes that are grossly out of proportion with the precipitating stressor and results in serious assaults on persons or objects. Many persons with anger control problems are not physically assaultive in this way and some have more generalized anger as the prominent issue. Although the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with disturbance of mood and conduct captures many presentations of angry clients, it fails to capture those whose anger is not a specific response to a recent stressor or doesn't have conduct issues involved with it. 

00:04:10
Axis I Mood disorders Psychotic Disorders Axis II Borderline personality disorder Antisocial personality disorder Narcissistic personality disorder Axis III Hypertension Coronary artery disease 

00:04:10
DR. ART JONGSMA Of course, features of anger can be found in Axis I clinical syndromes including mood and psychotic disorders, in Axis II disorders such as borderline, antisocial, and narcissistic personality disorders, as well as in Axis III conditions, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease. Should the client not show the other features of these disorders as well, these diagnoses are not applicable. 

00:04:40
Dimensions of anger: 1. The emotional experience of anger 2. Physiological correlates of anger 3. Cognitions associated with anger 4. The presence or absence of aggressive behavior 5. Whether and what triggering events may be evident 

00:04:40
DR. TIM BRUCE Clinicians know that anger control problems exist, can cause a significant stressor disability, and represent a treatment need in the community. Although there is an absence of specific anger disorders to capture common presentations, a scheme for conceptualizing, assessing, treating, and studying clinically significant anger has grown out of research on anger control problems. It highlights the assessment of five primary dimensions: one, the emotional experience of anger that the client has; two, physiological correlates of anger; three, cognitions associated with anger; four, the presence of absence of aggressive behavior; and five, whether and what triggering events may be evident. Let's look at each of these and how they relate to defining, assessing, and ultimately treating anger control problems. 

00:05:35
1. Evidence of angry emotionality involving strong feelings of anger: Episodic Chronic 

00:05:35
DR. ART JONGSMA For an anger control problem to be considered clinically significant, there should be evidence of episodic or chronic angry emotionality involving strong feelings or pervasive anger. 

00:05:45
2. Direct or indirect anger-related physiological arousal: Examples of direct arousal include: Elevated heart rate Muscle tension Restlessness Agitation Evidence of indirect anger-related arousal: Headaches Bruxism (teeth grinding) Other psychophysiological disorders 

00:05:45
DR. TIM BRUCE There should also be evidence of direct or indirect anger-related physiological arousal, although its particular expression may differ from person to person. Examples of direct arousal include elevated heart rate, muscle tension, restlessness, agitation and the like. Evidence of indirect anger-related arousal might involve things like headaches, bruxism, or other psychophysiological disorders. 

00:06:10
3. Cognitive features common to anger: Beliefs that they have been treated unfairly, been violated, intentionally harmed, hurt, or neglected Anger-related self-talk reflecting: strong inflexible demands of oneself, others, or circumstances internalized or externalized blaming labeling of person, situations, or events that is highly negative and overgeneralized Ruminating, brooding, and/or imaging revenge or retaliation Belief that their feelings and reactions are appropriate and justified, or serve as a source of guilt or shame 

00:06:15
DR. ART JONGSMA Third, the client should show significant cognitive involvement typical of anger. This may include beliefs that they have been treated unfairly, been violated, intentionally harmed, hurt, or neglected. It may include anger-related self-talk reflecting strong inflexible demands of oneself, others, or circumstances. It may involve internalized or externalized blaming and/or labeling of persons, situations, and events that is highly negative and overgeneralized. Cognitive involvement may also take the form of angry ruminating, brooding, and/or imagining revenge or retaliation that is difficult to control. The person may believe that their feelings and reactions are appropriate and justified, or they may serve as a source of guilt or shame. 

00:07:05
4. The behavioral expression of anger: Anger, but no aggressive behavior Indirect or passive aggression Direct and overt aggression 

00:07:10
DR. TIM BRUCE In addition to these emotional, physiological, and cognitive correlates of anger, the behavior used to express it is also part of defining its clinical significance. For example, some persons may experience strong anger but engage in no overtly aggressive behavior. Others may indirectly or passively aggress or directly and overtly aggress on a continuum ranging from angry words to physical violence. 

00:07:35
5. Triggers of anger (presence, absence, type) Situational Specific situation Situational theme Generalized Across various situations Response to recent psychosocial stressor(s) Absence of recent psychosocial stressor(s) 

00:07:35
DR. ART JONGSMA Lastly, assessing the clinical significance of anger also involves consideration of whether and what types of events trigger it. For example, some person's angry reactions are primarily situational. Others, however, may show a more generalized state of anger that occurs across many situations. 

00:07:55
DR. TIM BRUCE Another broader consideration regarding triggering events is recognition that some angry reactions are precipitated by the presence of one or more psychosocial stressors, such as a job loss or relationship change and may represent a change from the person's usual behavior, like an adjustment disorder, whereas other expressions of anger may occur in the absence of such stressors and may have long characterized the angry person's behavior. 

00:08:20
Assessing clinical significance: Quality of the emotional, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral expressions Their frequency, intensity, and duration Their appropriateness to the situation Their consequences for the individual and individual's adaptation or functioning 

00:08:25
DR. ART JONGSMA In assessing the clinical significance of anger control problems using these five dimensions, the diagnostician assesses the quality of the emotional, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral expressions; their frequency, intensity, and duration; their appropriateness to the situation; and their consequences for the individual and the individual's adaptation or functioning. 

00:08:50
1. Adjustment Disorder with Angry Mood: One or more psychosocial stressors and responded with excessive and/or maladaptive anger 

00:08:50
DR. TIM BRUCE For those interested in how this conceptual scheme might translate to clinical diagnoses, Eckhardt and Deffenbacher in 1995 proposed disorders representing the different expressions of anger along these five dimensions. These disorders are: adjustment disorder with angry mood. This diagnoses would capture those who have experienced one or more psychosocial stressors and responded with excessive and/or maladaptive anger. 

00:09:15
2. Situational Anger with Aggression 3. Situational Anger without Aggression Excessive and/or maladaptive anger in response to specific situations, with or without aggression 

00:09:20
DR. ART JONGSMA Situational anger with or without aggression. These two disorders capture patterns in which excessive and/or maladaptive anger is a primary response to a specific situation or situational themes, as well as whether the behavioral response to them involves aggression or does not. 

00:09:35
4. Generalized Anger Disorder with Aggression 5. Generalized Anger Disorder without Aggression Chronic, cross-situational anger with or without aggression Chronic, cross-situational anger without aggressive behavior 

00:09:40
DR. TIM BRUCE The last two diagnoses, generalized anger disorder with or without aggression, would refer to a chronic, cross-situational anger not unlike generalized anxiety disorder, but where the pervasive mood is anger, as well as specifying whether it's accompanied by aggressive behavior or not. 

00:10:00
DR. ART JONGSMA As with the current diagnostic system, the diagnoses of an anger control problem would require ruling out that a more encompassing Axis I or Axis II disorder does not account for it. 

00:10:10
DR. TIM BRUCE Whether converted into diagnostic terms like these, the conceptualization of anger described here involving its emotional, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions has not only influenced how anger control problems have been conceptualized and assessed, it has also influenced the development of the empirically supported treatments for anger that we'll be using to demonstrate evidence-based treatment planning in this program. 

00:10:40
DR. ART JONGSMA Having reviewed how anger and anger control problems can be defined, we'll now turn to the process of psychotherapy treatment planning and describe its essential steps. 

00:10:50
Six Steps to a Treatment Plan Identify Primary & Secondary Problems Describe Behavioral Definitions Diagnosis based on DSM/ICD Criteria Specify Long-term Goals Create Short-term Objectives Select Treatment Interventions 

00:10:50
DR. TIM BRUCE There are six essential steps in developing a treatment plan. Each is customized to the individual client's unique presentation. These steps are: identify the client's primary and secondary problems; describe behavioral definition to the problem--that is each problem's behavioral, cognitive, emotional, physical, and interpersonal manifestations; make a diagnosis based on DSM or ICD criteria; specify the long-term goals for the treatment process; create short-term objectives for the client; and select therapeutic interventions. 

00:11:30
DR. ART JONGSMA Our client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment, but as a first step in creating a treatment plan, the clinician must determine the most significant problem or problems, often by assessing which are most related to current distress, disability, or both. Usually a primary problem will surface and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few identified problems or treatment will lose its direction. 

00:12:05
DR. TIM BRUCE Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave, or interact will be, to some degree, unique to them and their situation. So each problem that is selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how it's evidenced in your particular client. Therefore, as a second step in the treatment planning process, the behavioral definition of the problem--that is the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, physical, and interpersonal features of the problem--are specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria such as those found in the DSM or ICD which should be kept in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. 

00:12:50
DR. ART JONGSMA The third step in treatment planning, the determination of an appropriate diagnosis, is based on an evaluation of the client's complete clinical picture. The clinician must compare the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal features causing distress or disability to the criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder as described in the DSM or the ICD. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnoses per se in formulating their treatment plans, but instead they prefer the focus on changes in the identified problem behavior, cognition, emotions and the like. Having said that, most third-party payers require a diagnosis and most ESTs are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems so it's usually necessary to make a diagnosis. However, with a presenting problem that does not have its own diagnostic category such as some presentations of anger control issues, the diagnostician should consider a diagnosis in which the presenting problem is part of the clinical picture. Of course, if the client's presentation does not meet the criteria for a DSM diagnosis, then none can be selected. 

00:14:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Step four in developing a treatment plan is to set long-term goals for the resolution of the client's primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted in measurable terms, but can be broader and indicate a desired, general, positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. 

00:14:40
DR. ART JONGSMA Writing short-term objectives for the client to achieve is step five in developing a treatment plan. In contrast to long-term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measurable or observable terms. Clearly stated objectives are helpful to both the therapist and client in assessing progress. They're also important to quality assurance review agencies, health maintenance organizations, and managed care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objectives should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. 

00:15:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Interventions are the actions of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives. Selecting the appropriate therapist interventions is the sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least one intervention planned for every client objective. If the client has not accomplished the objective after the initial interventions have been implemented, new interventions should be considered. 

00:15:45
DR. ART JONGSMA From what we have just described, it may sound like this is a pretty cut-and-dried process and that you'd just simply repeat the process with every client, but that's really not the case. One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client's unique problems, strengths, and needs. Treatment plans should not be boiler-plate, even if the clients have similar problems. The individual strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, cultural and social network, family circumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing a treatment strategy. Clinicians should rely on their own good clinical judgment and select interventions that are appropriate for the distinctive individual with whom they're working. 

00:16:35
DR. TIM BRUCE Now that we've discussed the steps involved with treatment planning, let's move on to how this treatment planning process can be informed by psychotherapy outcome research. We begin by providing a brief overview of the movement to identify empirically supported psychological treatments. 

00:16:55
DR. ART JONGSMA Although it can conceivably be argued that the movement to empirically informed psychological treatment began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in the early 1990s in Great Britain and then in the United States. 

00:17:15
Division 12 of the American Psychological Association: The Society of Clinical Psychology Division 12 Task Forces: The Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures (original) Task Force on Psychological Interventions (succeeding task force) http://www.psychologicaltreatments.org 

00:17:20
DR. TIM BRUCE On the forefront of the movement in the United States was Division 12 of the American Psychological Association: The Society of Clinical Psychology. In 1993, Division 12 organized a task force chaired by Dr. Diane Chambless and charged it with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature to identify psychological treatments whose efficacy had been demonstrated through clinical research. 

00:17:40
"Well-Established" "Probably Efficacious" 

00:17:40
DR. ART JONGSMA The group established criteria for judging quantity and quality of the research supporting a particular treatment and categorized treatment meeting these criteria as "well-established" or "probably efficacious." Both sets of criteria required replicated demonstrations of efficacy through high-quality trials or case series. The "well-established" category requires independent replication as well as other features, the details of which can be found in the workbook. 

00:18:10
Products of EST Reviews 

00:18:15
DR. TIM BRUCE By 1996, the group had identified a preliminary list of 25 ESTs meeting their criteria. By 1998, the list had grown to 71 ESTs. In 1999, Division 12 took full ownership of maintaining the growing list.

00:18:30
DR. ART JONGSMA Since the work of this original group, other reviewers have emerged using the same or similar criteria to review literature related to these and other populations, problems, and interventions. These are some examples.

DR. TIM BRUCE This resource was developed by Personal Improvement Computer Systems with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health and in consultation with the members of the original Division 12 task groups. There are also some organizational efforts to disseminate evidence-based medical and/or mental health practices or practice guidelines worth noting.

00:20:25
DR. TIM BRUCE In this series, we draw form these and other sources in our discussion of how clinicians can integrate goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with identified ESTs and evidence-based practice guidelines. 

00:20:40
ESTs for Anger Control Problems 

00:20:40
DR. ART JONGSMA Empirically informing a treatment plan, as described in this series, involves integrating those aspects of identified ESTs into each step of the treatment planning process discussed previously. Let's briefly look at the efforts to develop and identify ESTs and evidence-based practice guidelines for anger control problems. 

00:21:00
Novaco, R. (1975). Anger control: The development and evaluation of an experimental treatment. Lexington, MA: Lexington Books. Frequency, intensity, and duration of anger Physiological, cognitive, and behavioral expressions Effects on functioning 

00:21:05
DR. TIM BRUCE The scientific study of psychosocial treatments for anger control problems arguably began in the 1970s with the work of psychologist Raymond Novaco. Novaco conceptualized and treated anger as a learned, potentially maladaptive response set that could be defined on the dimensions we discussed earlier, including the frequency, intensity, and duration of anger, its correlated physiological, cognitive, and behavioral expressions, and their effects on functioning. In 1975, Novaco described the development and reported the efficacy of anger management training, or AMT. AMT is a cognitive behavioral treatment adapted from Donald Meichenbaum's stress inoculation training, or SIT. SIT has since been identified by Division 12 as a "well-established" treatment for coping with stress. 

00:21:50
Anger Management Training (AMT) Adapted from Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) (See Meichenbaum, D. (1985). Stress inoculation training. New York; Pergamon Press.) "Stress, including anger, results when the demands on a system exceed its resources, or when there are no adaptive responses available to meet the demands." SIT Teaches adaptive responses to stress/anger Exposes the client to increasingly larger "doses" or stress-inducing situations designed to strengthen the new skill set 

00:21:50
DR. ART JONGSMA The model upon which SIT is based asserts that stress, including anger, results when the demands on a system exceed its resources or when there are no adaptive responses available to meet the demands. Accordingly, clients participating in treatments based on SIT are taught those adaptive responses and then, consistent with the inoculation metaphor, expose to increasingly larger doses of stress-inducing situations designed to strengthen their new skill set. 

00:22:25
Anger Treatments based on SIT Features of SIT: Individually tailored Thorough initial assessment Psychoeducation Cognitive interventions Skills training SIT techniques include: Instruction Modeling Role-playing Live practice Feedback Designed to teach new ways of thinking and responding to anger-provoking situations that improve adaptation 

00:22:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Treatments for anger control problems based on SIT are tailored to the individual, based on an assessment of his or her current skill set. Interventions typically include psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, and skills training using techniques such as instruction, modeling, role-playing, live practice, and using corrective feedback--including reinforcement-- designed to teach new ways of thinking and responding to anger-provoking situations that improve the client's adaptation. 

00:23:00
Skills Corresponding to Dimensions of Anger Examples include: Relaxation skills for the physiological Cognitive restructuring for the cognitive Communication/assertiveness, problem-solving, conflict resolution, or other social skills for the behavioral 

00:23:00
DR. ART JONGSMA The exact skills trained depend on the assessed needs and/or deficits of the client, but typically correspond to the dimensions of anger we discussed previously. Examples include: learning relaxation skills for managing the physiological dimension of anger, cognitive therapy for the cognitive dimension, and communication training, problem-solving, conflict resolution, or other social skills for the behavioral dimension. 

00:23:30
This outcome literature is characterized by a test of multiple cognitive behavioral interventions singularly or in various combinations. Meta-analytic reviews support the efficacy of cognitive behavior treatments for anger control problems. 

00:23:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Since the development of AMT by Novaco, multiple variations of it and other cognitive behavioral interventions have been studied for anger control problems with a wide variety of populations. Examples of specific interventions studied, singularly or in combination, include but aren't limited to: various methods of relaxation training, biofeedback, meditation, systematic desensitization, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving, assertiveness, and other social skills training. 

00:24:00
DR. ART JONGSMA Meta-analytic reviews of this outcome literature have reported, with a high degree of consistency, support for the efficacy of these cognitive behavioral treatments for anger control problems. 

00:24:15
Beck, R., & Fernandez, E. (1998). Cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of anger: A meta-analysis. Cognitive therapy and research, 22, 63-74. Meta-analysis of CBT for anger reduction 50 studies, 1640 subjects The average CBT recipient was better off than 76% of untreated subjects in terms of anger reduction "This effect was statistically significant, robust, and relatively homogeneous across studies. These findings represent a quantitative integration of 20 years of research into a coherent picture of the efficacy of CBT for anger management" (Beck and Fernandez, 1998, p. 63) DiGiuseppe, R. & Tafrate, R. C. (2001). A comprehensive treatment model for anger disorders. Psychotherapy, 28(3), 262-271. Summary of 5 meta-analytic reviews SIT and related cognitive behavioral treatments "The anger treatments seem to work equally for all age groups and all types of populations and are equally effective for men and women" (DiGiuseppe and Tafrate , 2001, p. 263) 

00:24:15
DR. TIM BRUCE For example, Beck and Fernandez in 1998 conducted a meta-analysis of cognitive behavioral treatments for anger reduction based on 50 studies incorporating over 1600 participants. They found that CBT produced an effect size of .70, indicating that the average CBT recipient was better off than 76% of untreated subjects in terms of anger reduction. Regarding this result, Beck and Fernandez concluded "this effect was statistically significant, robust, and relatively homogeneous across studies. These findings represent a quantitative integration of 20 years of research into a coherent picture of the efficacy of CBT for anger management." In their summary of five meta-analytic reviews of SIT and related cognitive behavioral treatments for children, adolescents, and adults with anger control problems, DiGiuseppe and Tafrate concluded that "the anger treatments seem to work equally for all age groups and all types of populations and are equally effective for men and women." This conclusion has been echoed by other reviewers of this literature such as Kassinove and Tafrate in 2002. 

00:25:30
Key Criticism of the Outcome Literature Specific and nonspecific factors need to be ascertained Jerry Deffenbacher and Matthew McKay (2000): "Overcoming Situational and General Anger: A Protocol for the Treatment of Anger Based on Relaxation, Cognitive Restructuring, and Coping Skills Training" 

00:25:30
DR. ART JONGSMA Having said this, the outcome literature for anger reduction treatments has not gone uncriticized. A key criticism has been that, although numerous studies have supported the efficacy of CBT treatments for anger reduction, the current state of the literature does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding what components of these interventions are active and therefore necessary. Although critics acknowledge existing intervention programs for anger reduction have shown efficacy and should not be discontinued, they suggest that further research is needed to separate nonspecific from specific factors accounting for the efficacy. 

00:26:10
Suggest the protocol as a basic intervention of choice for the following empirical and clinical reasons: 1. "It is the most empirically supported anger-reduction intervention to date." 2. It "has been evaluated with a wide range of angry clients, including generally angry college student, angry drivers, angry police officers, angry delinquents, and angry community samples." 3. "Long-term follow-up studies support maintenance of anger reduction over periods of 12 to 15 months." 4. "...there is evidence that effects generalize to other sources of emotional distress such as anxiety." 

00:26:10
DR. TIM BRUCE Psychologist Jerry Deffenbacher and Matthew McKay developed an SIT-based treatment protocol involving relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and coping skills training that has been highly cited as an empirically supported treatment for anger control problems. Although they acknowledge that they cannot point to evidence that is significantly more effective than other variations of CBT, they do advance it as a basic intervention of choice for the following empirical and clinical reasons: as they note, first, it's the most empirically supported anger-reduction intervention to date; second, it's been evaluated with a wide range of angry clients, including generally angry college students, angry drivers, angry police officers, angry delinquents, and angry community samples; third, long-term follow-up studies support maintenance of anger reduction over periods of 12 to 15 months; and, fourth, there is evidence that effects generalize to other sources of emotional distress such as anxiety. 

00:27:10
Suggest the protocol as a basic intervention of choice for the following empirical and clinical reasons: 5. Addresses a reactance issue of clients and therapists to cognitive-only treatments 6. Can address interpersonal and non-interpersonal sources of anger 

00:27:10
DR. ART JONGSMA These authors also note that their protocol appears to readily address and important clinical issue that emerged as these types of treatments were being developed and studied; namely, that cognitive-only interventions were initially resisted by clients and therapists alike. 

00:27:30
DR. TIM BRUCE By this, the authors are referring to reports from initial studies where clients felt they were being told that their thinking was wrong and reacted with anger and resistance to this impression. Therapists reported feeling " verbally beat-up" by clients. This reactance, which risks breaching the therapeutic relationship and leading to treatment drop-outs, was not found when cognitive interventions were preceded by relaxation training interventions. 

00:27:55
DR. ART JONGSMA Lastly, Deffenbacher and McKay note that, although up to 80% of anger control problems occur in an interpersonal context, their treatment approach is applicable to both interpersonal and non-interpersonal sources of anger, while other approaches emphasizing interpersonal skills building are not.

APA Definition of an Evidence-based Practice "the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise, in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences" (American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice (APA), 2006, p. 273) Best available evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral treatment based on Stress Inoculation Training is an empirically support treatment worth considering as a first-line intervention for clients with anger control problems 

00:28:25
DR. ART JONGSMA For our purposes in demonstrating evidence-based treatment planning, we are going to stay consistent with the definition of an evidence-based practice advanced by The American Psychological Association which states that it is "the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise, in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences." 

00:28:50
CBT for Anger Control Problems One-to-one Typically one-hour therapy sessions An average of once a week 8-16 sessions, depending on progress in session and homework 

00:28:50
DR. TIM BRUCE By all accounts, the best available evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy is consistent with stress inoculation training on empirically supported treatment, worth considering as a first-line base intervention for clients with anger control problems. These types of treatments typically involve one-to-one sessions, typically one-hour in length, and usually conducted once a week. The total length of therapy runs 8 to 16 sessions, depending on the client's progress. Therapy takes place both in session and through between session homework practice. 

00:29:25
Phases of Treatment Assessment Psychoeducation Relaxation Training Cognitive Restructuring Skills Training (if skill deficit exists) Imaginal rehearsal to graduated anger-engendering scenes Live practice to graduated anger-engendering situations Relapse prevention 

00:29:25
DR. ART JONGSMA The general phases of this type of treatment for anger control problems are: assessment, psychoeducation, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, skills training (if there is a skill deficit,) imaginal rehearsal to graduated anger-engendering scenes, live practice to graduated anger-engendering situations, and relapse prevention. 

00:29:50
Integrating the EST into Treatment Planning 

00:29:50
DR. TIM BRUCE With this background in mind, let's now look at how this empirically supported treatment approach for anger control problems can be integrated into the essential steps involved in treatment planning that we outlined earlier. After determining that anger control is the primary presenting problem, we added the treatment plan those behavioral manifestations of the problem that the client experiences. Although there are commonalities in the presentation of anger control problems, the treatment plan should be tailored to each client's unique expression of it. 

00:30:20
Examples of Behavioral Definitions: 1. Shows a pattern of episodic excessive anger in response to specific situations or situational themes 2. Shows a pattern general excessive anger across many situations 3. Shows cognitive biases associated with anger (e.g., demanding expectations of others, overly generalized labeling of the targets of anger, anger in response to perceived "slights.") 4. Evidences direct or indirect evidence of physiological arousal related to anger 5. Reports a history of explosive, aggressive outbursts out of proportion with any precipitating stressors, leading to verbal attacks, assaultive acts or destruction for property 6. Displays over-reactive verbal hostility to insignificant irritants 7. Engages in physical and or emotional abuse against significant other 8. Makes swift and harsh judgmental statements to or about others 9. Displays body language suggesting anger, including tense muscles (e.g., clenched fist or jaw), glaring looks, or refusal to make eye contact 10. Uses passive-aggressive patterns (e.g., social withdrawal, lack of complete or timely compliance in following directions or rules, complaining about authority figures behind their backs, uncooperative in meeting expected behavioral norms) due to anger 11. Passively withholds feelings and then explodes in a rage 12. Demonstrates an angry overreaction to perceived disapproval, rejection, or criticism 13. Uses abusive language meant to intimidate others 14. Rationalizes and blames others for aggressive and abusive behavior 15. Uses aggression as a means of achieving power and control 

00:30:25
DR. ART JONGSMA The behavioral definitions shown on the screen capture the major presentations of anger control problems seen clinically, although they can be modified to accommodate the particular client. This list includes references to situational anger and generalized expressions of anger. It includes cognitive and physiological manifestations of anger as well as examples of various expressions of aggressive behavior, including those that are nonverbal, verbal, both verbal and physical, as well as passive-aggressive and combined passive and direct aggression. As we said, definitions should be edited or added to so that they best describe and define your particular client's manifestation of his or her anger control problem. 

00:31:15
Examples of Long-term Goals: 1. Learn and implement anger management skills to reduce the level of anger and irritability that accompanies it 2. Increase respectful communication through the use of assertiveness and conflict resolution skills 3. Develop an awareness of angry thoughts, feelings, and actions, clarifying origins of, and learning alternative to aggressive anger 4. Decrease the frequency, intensity, and duration of angry thoughts, feelings, and actions and increase the ability to recognize and respectfully express frustration and resolve conflict 5. Implement cognitive behavioral skills necessary to solve problems in a less aggressive and more constructive manner 

00:31:15
DR. TIM BRUCE The next step in treatment planning is to determine a long-term goal or goals. For our primary problem of anger control, examples might include: learn and implement anger management skills to reduce the level of anger and irritability that accompanies it or decrease the frequency, intensity, and duration of angry thoughts, feelings, and actions and increase the ability to recognize and respectfully express frustration and resolve conflict. Again, others can be added at the discretion of the therapist and client. 

00:31:50
Assessment Phase See the Workbook for more complete information. 

00:31:50
DR. ART JONGSMA We now direct our attention to applying client objectives and therapeutic interventions consistent with those of empirically supported treatments. While common to all forms of therapy, the assessment phase of anger treatment typically involves asking the client to describe the history and nature of the anger symptoms, their frequency, intensity, and duration, as well as the impact of them on his or her social, occupational, and interpersonal functioning. The client may be asked to monitor incidents in which anger became an issue as well as relevant dimensions such as thoughts, feelings, and actions. Psychological tests or objective measures relevant to the assessment of anger may be used to supplement the clinical interview and/or track treatment response. The assessment phase may also involve an evaluation of the need for medication. 

00:32:45
Psychoeducation See the Workbook for more complete information. 

00:32:45
DR. TIM BRUCE Cognitive behavior therapy for anger control problems emphasizes initial and ongoing psychoeducation. In addition to helping facilitate a client's progress in therapy, the process and content of psychoeducation is used to motivate, instill hope, and otherwise enhance the therapeutic relationship. In this example, psychoeducation is used as a means to teach the client about the complex nature of his or her presenting problem. Exploring the negative consequences of dysfunctional expressions of anger, as well as the potential positive effects of learning more adaptive ways to manage it, is a common motivational intervention used in anger reduction treatments. 

00:33:30
DR. ART JONGSMA Initial psychoeducation should be used to convey the treatment model and its rationale. Lastly, psychoeducation is often facilitated by the assignment of readings or other media that supplement and/or reinforce information conveyed in the session. 

00:33:45
DR. TIM BRUCE Let's look now at our first demonstration vignette. It's a selected example of the therapist doing a psychoeducational intervention within an anger control treatment. 

00:33:55
BILL Frank, I think to really understand this therapy and get the most out of it, we need to talk about the emotion of anger and how we want to think about it. We tend to think of anger as just an emotional response to a trigger situation, but anger actually has many different components. Can you think think of any other features of anger other than the emotional one? 

00:34:15
FRANK I just know when I'm angry, I wanna let somebody have it. 

00:34:20
BILL Yes, we do sometimes let people have it when we're angry. That's the behavioral component of anger. Behavioral means what we say and do. With anger, it refers to the tendency to express your feelings in angry words or actions. So, there are the emotional and behavioral features of anger. What else happens when you're angry? 

00:34:45
FRANK I'm not sure. 

00:34:45
BILL Well, another part of anger is the physiological side of it: how your body reacts when you begin to feel anger. What do you notice happens to you physically when you get angry? 

00:34:55
FRANK When I get real mad, my heart starts to pound. I almost start to shake. Is that what you mean? 

00:35:00
BILL Yes, those are the physiological signs of anger: the body gets a rush of adrenaline and gets ready to fight. 

00:35:05
FRANK I don't fight, though. At least I haven't in a while. I mostly just get tense. 

00:35:15
BILL Okay, so your current physical reaction to anger is mostly tension. How about another component of anger? We know physically we get tense, we're feeling the emotion of anger, and we have a tendency to behave in an angry way. Can you come up with one more aspect or feature of anger? 

00:35:30
FRANK Behavior, emotion, physical. I don't know. 

00:35:40
BILL Well, there's what we call the cognitive component. This refers to how you think when you're angry, what you're thinking about at the very moment of anger. If you could hear your own thoughts, listen carefully to what you're saying to yourself at those moments, what we call your self-talk. Then you'd get a sense of how you're perceiving the situation at the moment. 

00:36:00
FRANK So what's I'm thinking is important, too? 

00:36:00
BILL Yes. Your thoughts, the self-talk, can actually affect what you feel and how strongly you feel it. So how to feel and what you think both affect each other, kind of back and forth, really. Remember, anger has four aspects: the feeling, the thoughts, the inside physical reaction, and the outward behavior. These all occur together in a rapid sequence where angry thoughts generate the emotion of anger, physical feelings associated with anger come, and then lead to some form of angry behavior. 

00:36:35
FRANK I'm not sure I understand the sequence thing. 

00:36:40
BILL Okay. Let's look at this process through an example. Consider the time you got angry with Brad at work when he told you he was leaving early the other day. What thoughts went through your mind when you heard that? 

00:36:50
FRANK I didn't think, I just got mad. 

00:36:55
BILL Well, that's part of the point of breaking this down. It seems like we don't think at those moments, but, when we look closely, we find that we do. This process can be very quick, though, sometimes so automatic. It's hard to catch. Let's see if we can find these quick thoughts in this situation. Put yourself back and say what comes immediately to your mind. I'm Brad and I say "I'm leavin'!" 

00:37:20
FRANK I think I thought something like "aw, great. Whenever there's a lot of work to do, you find an excuse to get out of it and I've told him before, you're just lazy." 

00:37:30
BILL Now you're getting at the thoughts that lead to the emotion of anger that you felt. Did you do or say something? 

00:37:35
FRANK No, I just kind of stared at him and walked off is disgust. 

00:37:40
BILL So you did something to express your anger, a behavior, but it wasn't direct or confrontational. You held back on that. 

00:37:50
FRANK Yeah, I see. So behavior could be lots of different things depending on the situation? 

00:37:55
BILL Yeah, depending on what you decide to do in the situation. So, are you seeing how the thoughts generate the emotion and that leads to the physical tension and the behavior? 

00:38:05
FRANK I think I'm gettin' it. 

00:38:10
DR. TIM BRUCE I thought the primary value of that particular vignette was that it communicated the definition of anger to the client. 

00:38:15
DR. ART JONGSMA The four different phases and different components of anger. He covered that well. 

00:38:20
DR. TIM BRUCE And I think, you know, in terms of demonstrating an empirically supported treatment, one of the things that you try to do is you try to help that client understand a new way of looking at anger in these different components, how they sequence, and then that kind of lends itself to segueing into the rationale for treatment where you're gonna intervene in different of these things and I think he set that up in this. 

00:38:45
DR. ART JONGSMA I appreciated how he tried to draw some of that out of the client-- wasn't always successful in drawing out of the client, as it really happens, it isn't successful- usually--but at least he was trying to engage the client. Rather than just lecture him and tell him the material, he was trying to draw some of that out. 

00:39:00
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, and I think, you know, that this kind of question and answer thing, especially with angry clients, can risk that you can make them defensive. I mean, as they keep missing questions, they might start to get a little perturbed, so it's a little risky doing that. What I liked was how he finished: he ended up taking an example from the client's life and then elucidating the concepts. 

00:39:20
DR. ART JONGSMA So applying what it is that he just tried to teach, and now let's apply it in an example from your day-to-day life. 

00:39:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, and I think something important for the viewers to keep in mind is that, you know, this is the beginning of a process that is going to continue through therapy so they're going to constantly go through examples and say "well, that's the cognitive" and eventually you want that client to be able to do this very easily. 

00:39:45
DR. ART JONGSMA Psychoeducation isn't done just in the first session or second session, it's done throughout the process of therapy. 

00:39:50
DR. TIM BRUCE Right. And I guess one of the things, too, that I think is representative of the STs is that he then kind of did a reading assignment. Let's follow this up, let's do some more psychoeducation through other means to kind of reinforce or supplement that. I like that. 

00:40:05
DR. ART JONGSMA It's something that I do, too, in my practice and have done. I also notice that it's difficult to get clients to follow through on that, that you have to stay with them and you've got to also follow it up so that you process that material with the client. 

00:40:15
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, absolutely. 

00:40:20
DR. ART JONGSMA Yup. 

00:40:20
Calming and Coping Treatment Objectives and Interventions See the Workbook for more complete information. 

00:40:20
DR. TIM BRUCE A common set of objectives and interventions consistent with empirically supported treatments for anger control problems involves teaching the client how to calm themselves, both generally and in anger-provoking situations. 

00:40:30
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Teach the client calming techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation, breathing induced relaxation, calming imagery, cue-controlled relaxation, applied relaxation) as part of a tailored strategy for reducing chronic and acute physiological tension that accompanies his/her angry feelings. 

00:40:30
DR. ART JONGSMA Progressive muscle relaxation training is a well-known intervention used for teaching general and situational calming skills. When trained for situational use, it is typically condensed from the initial comprehensive exercise to a form that can be used quickly for coping purposes. Condensing the exercise in this way is usually done by combining muscle groups over time to shorten the total time it takes to relax. For example, the client might start by relaxing each of 16 muscle groups, then subsequently reduce them to eight, then four, then one. Clients can also be taught other applications of relaxation, such as inducing it through breathing only or without using tension or by pairing it with a word, image, or both to the relaxed state. The latter, called cue-controlled relaxation, is designed to allow the client to induce a relaxed state by recalling the cue. Often, all of these skills are taught. 

00:41:35
2. Role-play the use of relaxation and cognitive coping to visualized anger-provoking scenes, moving from low- to high-anger scenes. Assign the implementation of calming techniques in his/her daily life when facing angry trigger situational process the results, reinforcing success and problem-solving obstacles. 

00:41:40
DR. TIM BRUCE This relaxation skill will later be combined with other coping techniques and practiced using imagined anger-provoking scenes. The client will be asked to practice using this developing skill set in day-to-day live applications designed to build a consolidated approach for managing anger. 

00:41:55
DR. ART JONGSMA In this vignette, the client is taught a rapid relaxation technique using four muscle groups and is then introduced to how relaxation can be applied during anger-provoking situations. 

00:42:10
BILL Okay, Frank. In today's session, I would like to work on bringing together some of the things you and I have been working on, especially the relaxation exercise you've been doing. Alright, last session we reviewed your anger journal assignment and we found some situations that triggered your anger. I wrote some of the situations down like when your wife tells you she's going out with her girlfriends for the evening or when your son, Randy, leaves his room a mess again. There were a few others but this gives us enough for now. Um, do you recall us talking about these situations? 

00:42:45
FRANK Yep, I've blown up over all those things. I need to get under control. 

00:42:50
BILL So let's talk about how to do that. Today, we're gonna focus on using your relaxation skill during those trigger situations. As you know, the use of relaxation is focused mostly on the physical side of anger, but it's part of an overall strategy that will help you also manage the thinking side and the behavior side of your anger. 

00:43:10
FRANK I understand. First, I need to be calmer. 

00:43:15
BILL Exactly. Let's pick a situation that's been a trigger for you. 

00:43:20
FRANK I had one this morning. My wife told me she was going to dinner with her friends after work. I hate when she does this. I have to get dinner for me, the kids. 

00:43:30
BILL Okay, so your wife going out for dinner with friends served as a trigger for your anger. Let's look at the physical reaction to that. What did you feel physically? 

00:43:40
FRANK Tense, especially my jaw. I clenched my teeth, my face. 

00:43:45
BILL That's a good description, Frank, and it's a very common response. Now, we've been working on relaxation and getting it down to where you can do it fairly quickly. Do you feel you're getting it down? 

00:43:55
FRANK Yeah, I can get myself relaxed much better than before. 

00:44:00
BILL Great! So let's review what we've done. You've gone from tensing and releasing 16 groups of muscles down to 12, eight, and then four groups. You then learned the release-only relaxation with the four muscle groups, and you've been pairing the self-talk statement "relax" with deep breathing when you're very relaxed. 

00:44:20
FRANK Exactly. That's exactly where I'm at. 

00:44:25
BILL Okay. So let's move to the last step. As we've talked about, part of managing anger involves catching those moments when anger is just starting and interrupting the tension response with a quick relaxation. response. What I'd like to do now, Frank, is to practice again the release-only exercise with the word "relax" and then talk about how to use it in everyday situations. Why don't you go ahead and get comfortable in your chair and close your eyes. Now focus on the four muscle groups we've worked on and release the tension in each of these groups: first, your arms . . . and now your chest and upper back . . . okay, that was a good review. And you did great! How do you feel? 

00:45:15
FRANK I feel good. I'd like to stay in that spot. 

00:45:20
BILL I'm sure you would. The next step is to put your new relaxation skill together with what you have learned about trigger situations. When you sense a trigger situation is coming, that's the time to use this relaxation skill to interrupt the cycle of tension that begins to build. Let's role-play a situation that has gotten you mad and have you apply the calming techniques of relaxing your muscles, breathing deeply, and using the self-statement of "relax." I will play the role of your wife and you be yourself. Respond to what I say the way you think is appropriate but as soon as you hear fighting words, I want you to begin to breathe deep and relax. 

00:46:00
FRANK I'll give that a try. 

00:46:00
BILL Okay. Here we go. Frank, Sarah called this afternoon and invited me to go to dinner and drinks with her and Joyce tomorrow night. I haven't been with them in months so I told her I would come along. That means you need to feed the kids dinner. I'll have the casserole ready to put in the oven. I know this bugs you, but I don't do it that often, so please let it be. 

00:46:20
FRANK Alright. I'll take care of it. Relax. It does seem to help, but I wonder if it will really help in a real situation. 

00:46:35
BILL It can work very well if you stay with it. Remember to use your cue word "relax" and to keep your breathing smooth and deep. Now, let's role-play another trigger situation, this time with your son Randy. This time I would like you to respond to Randy calmly about his messy room while you are trying to stay relaxed. 

00:46:55
DR. ART JONGSMA A good example, I think, of how this process needs to be applied to the individual client's situation. And I like how Bill started here with "let's look at what's going on in your life right now" and picked up a situation that he had a conflict with his wife that morning and so on. I think that's an important concept is don't just teach the skill and the abstract, but teach it as it applies to your particular situation. 

00:47:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, and it looks like, you know, this is that transition between him having done, you know, 16 muscle group relaxation down to eight, so he's been at this for a while. 

00:47:30
DR. ART JONGSMA That's right. 

00:47:30
DR. TIM BRUCE And now they're kind of in that transition where they're gonna apply it to various situations. 

00:47:35
DR. ART JONGSMA Again, teaching this skill is not something that's done in one session. It's something that takes a good number of sessions before you can get a client down to four muscle groups and maybe even down to just using a cue word, which he was also trying to teach him to use a cue word. 

00:47:50
DR. TIM BRUCE Exactly. Um, one of the things that I want to mention that is, you know, relevant to ESTs for anger management is there are alternative ways of doing this and you'll see that an alternative to this in some ESTs. In some of them, what they'll do is they will actually have the client, you know, close their eyes and imagine an angry scene, maybe describe it and so on, until they actually start to feel anger. 

00:48:15
DR. ART JONGSMA Until the anger starts to build. 

00:48:15
DR. TIM BRUCE Till they actually have a, we don't see that here, but we're just talking about its application somewhere else. But this is more of an exercise done where they generate the anger and then stop in the middle of that and calm themselves down and so on and, as this progresses through therapy, you add the cognitive coping skills and you may even then move toward adding "well, how would you resolve it? How would you resolve this conflict? What might you say?" and so on and you keep pairing this together. It's more of a systematic approach and we're doing something similar here. 

00:48:45
DR. ART JONGSMA Sure. So it's a use of various different types of coping skills rather than just the relaxation. 

00:48:50
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, and it still boils down to interrupting this kind of angry response set with the new one that might involve a physiological aspect, a cognitive aspect, and another one. And that's where this is going, you know, in theory. 

00:49:10
DR. ART JONGSMA Yeah, where is this gonna go for this client? 

00:49:10
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, you know, you're gonna develop your coping skills for the physiological dimension, you're gonna start to work with the cognitive domain and start incorporating the results of that into this. It's like creating a management skill package, if you will, including things like how to resolve conflict, how to communicate assertively. So this is early in therapy, building these kind of skills, similar to kind of this stress inoculation model. 

00:49:35
Cognitive Restructuring Objectives and Interventions See the Workbook for more complete instructions. 

00:49:35
DR. ART JONGSMA Let's move on to integrating objectives and interventions into our treatment plan that involve cognitive restructuring of anger-related thoughts and beliefs. The client objective for cognitive restructuring is a statement that covers the general phases of the cognitive restructuring process, including identifying, challenging, and changing angry self-talk and beliefs. 

00:50:00
1. Explore the client's self-talk that mediates his/her angry feelings and actions (e.g., demanding expectations reflected in should, must, or have to statements); identify and challenge biases, assisting him/her in generating appraisals and self-talk that corrects for the biases and facilitates a more flexible and temperate response to frustration. Combine new self-talk with calming skills as part of a developing coping skills managing anger. 2. Role-play the use of relaxation and cognitive coping to visualized anger-provoking scenes, moving from low- to high-anger scenes. Assign the implementation of calming techniques in his/her daily life when facing anger trigger situations; process the results, reinforcing success and problem-solving obstacles. 3. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he/she identifies angry self-talk and generates alternatives that help moderate angry reactions; review while reinforcing success, providing corrective feedback toward improvement. 

00:50:05
DR. TIM BRUCE Therapist's interventions consistent with cognitive restructuring typically include teaching the connection between thoughts and feelings, identifying angry self-talk, challenging the biases evident in it, generating alternative appraisals that correct for those biases, and facilitating a more flexible, temperate response to frustration. Again, as a therapy progresses, this new cognitive response set is combined with calming skills and then practiced in imagined scenes and live situations to help consolidate it. 

00:50:35
DR. ART JONGSMA Interventions reflecting homework exercises to facilitate in session work are commonly incorporated into the treatment plan for major objectives and interventions such as cognitive restructuring. 

00:50:50
DR. TIM BRUCE In this next vignette, the therapist helps the client learn about the connection between his self-talk and his emotional reactions of anger. 

00:51:00
BILL So, Frank, we've been talking about how anger is associated with certain types of self-talk and certain situations. This self-talk leads to what you feel, which is the emotion of anger. The emotion has all the physical stuff that goes along with it, most of which for you is tension. And then these thoughts and feelings lead us to say or do something in anger, including just swallowing it and fuming. Make sense? 

00:51:25
FRANK Yeah, I'm starting to see the connection better. 

00:51:30
BILL Good. Now so far you've learned how to try and stop and calm yourself before going off by relaxing as soon as you sense you are getting angry. I'd like to talk to you today about the thinking side of anger. You've done some journaling of your thoughts at these moments. What have you found? 

00:51:50
FRANK Well, I got kind of ticked off standing in line at the grocery store the other day. There's a lot of people shopping but they had only two lines open. 

00:52:00
BILL Yep, I know exactly what you mean. It's a classic. So what happened? 

00:52:05
FRANK I was definitely gettin' angry. I was just standing there, waiting. You see there's other employees who were standing around who could've been helping, opening, you know, another line. 

00:52:15
BILL Okay, I see. So let's see what you wrote down in the columns. First, what emotion and at what level? 

00:52:20
FRANK Well, anger, frustration, really. About five or six. 

00:52:25
BILL And physically? 

00:52:30
FRANK Uh, I wrote tension. It was a four. 

00:52:35
BILL Alright, good. What thoughts were you having at the moment you felt yourself getting frustrated? 

00:52:40
FRANK Well, I wrote they could've opened up another line, um, so, you know, we could get out faster. 

00:52:50
BILL Good, Frank. But let's see if we can get at how that actually ran through your head: your self-talk, uncensored. 

00:52:55
FRANK Uncensored? I thought this happens all the damn time. When customers are waiting, you need to do something, not just ignore us. 

00:53:05
BILL Good. That's exactly what I want you to start to listen for and record: the raw, uncensored words you say. Let's write that down in the self-talk column. Alright, last thing: what did you do or say, the behavior? 

00:53:25
FRANK Well, I just wanted to say "could you guys open some lanes instead of just standing around?" 

00:53:30
BILL But you didn't? 

00:53:30
FRANK No. Actually, I caught myself and just did the relax thing. 

00:53:35
BILL Good! What effect did it have on you? 

00:53:40
FRANK Well, it helped. I mean, I kept my mouth shut but I wasn't happy about it. I mean, don't you think they should've done something about it? 

00:53:45
BILL Yeah, I think that's what most people want in that situation, but it doesn't always happen that way, does it? 

00:53:55
FRANK Nope, it didn't there. 

00:53:55
BILL But remember we talked about how you'll be much more effective in getting them to do the right thing when you're not showing angry behavior. 

00:54:05
FRANK I remember. 

00:54:05
BILL So let's talk about that, Frank. What's going on when you have an expectation of something or someone but the situation or the person isn't `meeting it? 

00:54:15
FRANK Alright. 

00:54:15
DR. ART JONGSMA Now here we see the therapist moving from the physical realm, the relaxation use of that technique, now moving into teaching this skill of some cognitive restructuring and I think that's a nice transition that he's providing for the client here. 

00:54:35
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, and the first step in that transition is to teach the client the link between what they think and what they feel because a lot of people feel that their emotions are just something that, you know, overcomes them and the cognitive therapy approach is saying, you know, your thinking influences, actually, not only the type but the degree of emotion and that's kind of where they're at with this. 

00:54:55
DR. ART JONGSMA They can talk easily about their feelings but, when you ask them what they were thinking, that's harder for them. You really have to lead them quite carefully to get at the thoughts. 

00:55:05
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, and one way to do that--which he's using in this approach--is to have them go out in their world and, you know, self-monitor or journal, you know, what you thought, what you felt, just divide this up and then that can be used for this kind of psychoeducation aspect of cognitive restructuring. 

00:55:20
DR. ART JONGSMA Sure. So where do you think this is going next? 

00:55:25
DR. TIM BRUCE Well, you know, obviously in the cognitive restructuring you start with the connection between thinking and feeling and then you're moving toward biases, like one of them that we saw here was the whole issue of expectations not being met. 

00:55:35
DR. ART JONGSMA Ah, yeah. 

00:55:35
DR. TIM BRUCE You know, demanding expectations and so on. And then you're gonna talk about "well, what other biases are here? What are the alternatives to these?" and then move toward, you know, probably prediction testing and behavioral experiments to kind of make that cognitive shift toward these alternatives. 

00:55:50
DR. ART JONGSMA It seemed like this client was just beginning to understand that those unmet expectations or demands were really feeding some of his anger. 

00:56:00
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, they're probably gonna spend a lot of time with that. 

00:56:00
DR. ART JONGSMA Yeah, I think so. 

00:56:00
Assertiveness Training Objectives and Interventions See the Workbook for more complete information. 

00:56:00
DR. TIM BRUCE Cognitive behavioral treatments for anger control problems, particularly those adapted from stress inoculation training, often assess whether communication and other social skills should be trained as part of an overall anger management skill set. The decision to train these skills depends on whether the clinical picture seems to be one of excess anger precluding a skilled individual from using those skills or whether there appears to be a skill deficit in addition to excessive anger. In the former, somatic and cognitive coping skills may suffice and allow the individual to use his or her existing skills more effectively. In the latter case, skills training, tailored to the client's needs and deficits, would be added to the treatment approach. 

00:56:50
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Use instruction, modeling, and/or role-playing to teach the client the distinctive elements as well as the pros and cons of assertive, unassertive (passive), and aggressive communication. 2. Teach the client assertiveness/conflict resolution skills (e.g., empathy, active listening, "I messages", respectful communication, assertiveness without aggression, compromise); use modeling, role-playing, and behavior rehearsal to work through several current conflicts. 1. Assign the client homework of applying the newly learned calming, cognitive, and assertiveness skills to daily life situations that formerly were triggers for aggressiveness; review and reinforce success and problem-solve obstacles. 

00:56:50
DR. ART JONGSMA Assertive communication refers to the ability to express one's thoughts and feelings in an honest, open, and direct manner while respecting the rights of others to do the same and is a skill set commonly taught in empirically supported treatment for anger control problems. Use of these skills to resolve conflicts is a common implication. 

00:57:10
DR. TIM BRUCE And again, assigning the client homework that helps him or her apply and strengthen their newly learned skills is a common intervention in empirically supported treatments for anger. One pattern of communication seen in some clients with anger control problems is that they tend to manage frustrations unassertively until the point that it becomes intolerable and then behave aggressively. In our last vignette, the therapist and client discuss the important distinction between assertiveness, aggressiveness, and unassertiveness. 

00:57:45
BILL Okay, Frank, do these distinctions between passive or unassertive, assertive, and aggressive communication make sense to you? 

00:57:50
FRANK Yeah. Unassertive is when you don't stand up for yourself, assertive is when you do, aggressive is when you push yourself on other people. 

00:58:00
BILL Good! I also think it helps to keep in mind the basic rights everyone has when communicating. Everyone has a right to what they think and feel and the right to express it as long as they're not forcing it on others. Forcing it is which type of communication? 

00:58:15
FRANK Aggression? 

00:58:20
BILL Right. And expressing what you think or feel and allowing others the right to do the same is which one? 

00:58:25
FRANK Assertive. 

00:58:25
BILL Exactly. And not expressing yourself assertively or not exercising your right to your opinion, just holding in what you think or feel and usually ending up feeling frustrated, that's what? 

00:58:40
FRANK Being passive or unassertive. I always thought assertive was what we were calling aggressive, like giving people a piece of your mind. 

00:58:45
BILL But that's not what you understand now. 

00:58:45
FRANK No, that's being aggressive. 

00:58:50
BILL I think you're understanding this well. Let me ask you: we've talked about expectations that aren't being met and how they influence the level of anger we can feel. 

00:59:00
FRANK Yeah. 

00:59:00
BILL Sometimes we can recognize that the expectation is demanding and if we can make it more of a preference, we're more flexible and don't react as strongly. 

00:59:10
FRANK Right, like saying "okay, if it doesn't happen, I can live?" 

00:59:20
BILL Exactly. Then there are times when we think our expectations are reasonable but they're not being met. This may be a time when we want to communicate, to discuss the mismatch, and try to find a compromise. It might be a change in thinking, a change in behavior, on the other person's part, or both. Make sense? 

00:59:35
FRANK Yeah, I think sometimes I just eat it and then I get frustrated and then I get angrier and angrier. 

00:59:40
BILL Do you recognize what type of communication you were electing to do in this situation? 

00:59:50
FRANK Unassertive? 

00:59:50
BILL Exactly. It's not unusual that the frustration caused by unassertive communication builds up like you described and, as it builds, what kind of communication do you think you would be vulnerable to do? 

01:00:00
FRANK Be aggressive. 

01:00:05
BILL Do you see this back and forth between unassertive and aggressive? 

01:00:10
FRANK Yeah, I think I do this a lot. I sit and steam, then I blow up, sometimes not even about the thing I'm mad about. 

01:00:15
BILL I think this is an important insight you're having, Frank. If you could discuss your thoughts and feelings directly, respectfully, allowing the other person to do the same and looking for some common resolution, do you think this would have some value in managing your anger? 

01:00:30
FRANK Yes, I do, but I need to learn how to do this. It's not what I'm used to. 

01:00:35
BILL Fair enough. We'll spend some time on learning to communicate assertively and practicing that until you feel good with it. 

01:00:45
DR. TIM BRUCE Well, this may be the most laidback angry client I think I've ever seen. 

01:00:50
DR. ART JONGSMA He is quite passive, isn't he? 

01:00:50
DR. TIM BRUCE He is passive. But I think it's important for those who haven't dealt with anger management issues to know that a lot of these clients are very defensive and you've got to be kind of gentle. 

01:01:00
DR. ART JONGSMA Well, that might build his anger if he doesn't really express it in any kind of way except explosively. 

01:01:05
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah. True, true. I do think that, you know, what this vignette conveyed well was this distinction that's kind of a classic distinction between the three forms of communication that are often highlighted in assertiveness training: unassertion, assertiveness, and aggression. 

01:01:20
DR. ART JONGSMA Yeah, and I think the therapist did a good job of allowing the client to see these different distinctions and applying it to his own life and then asking him again the question "what kind of interaction would that be? Was that assertiveness or passive?" 

01:01:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Checking to make sure he's getting it. 

01:01:35
DR. ART JONGSMA Yup, yup. 

01:01:35
DR. TIM BRUCE The other thing I thought was good here and is kind of characteristic of these therapies is--we talked about it before--this ongoing nature of things. So, you know, you're bringing forward psychoeducation, the calming skills, the cognitive restructuring, and here in talking about skills training, assertion skills, he also brings those themes up from the cognitive restructuring like demanding expectations and that kind of thing. 

01:01:55
DR. ART JONGSMA Ah, yes. Trying to help him see better that they would be preferences rather than demands of the situation. 

01:02:05
DR. TIM BRUCE Right, so he's tying together a more comprehensive understanding and skill set and I think that was good. 

01:02:05
DR. ART JONGSMA And where's this going? Where do you think the future is for this? 

01:02:10
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, well, you know, where they're going is to consolidate this whole approach and practice it and rehearse it and then take it outside the session and identify, you know, exercises and bring that back and review and just try to really strengthen and consolidate the (inaudible ). 

01:02:26
DR. ART JONGSMA Role-playing a lot of different situations where he can apply assertiveness to it. 

01:02:26
Relapse Prevention 

01:02:26
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, in stress inoculation training, where a lot of these approaches are adapted, those situations are going to become increasingly more challenging to kind of strengthen that skill set. Whether treated pharmacologically, psychologically, or both, anger control problems--like other behavioral problems--are prone to relapse. Let's look at some common considerations in relapse prevention and how they can be incorporated into your treatment plan. 

01:02:55
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 1. Explain the rationale of relapse 2. Distinguish between lapse and relapse 3. Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse 4. Review the application of skills learned in therapy to high-risk situations 5. Encourage routine use of skills learned in therapy 6. Schedule periodic "booster" therapy sessions" 

01:02:55
DR. ART JONGSMA One of the first steps in relapse prevention is to provide a rationale for it. This typically involves a discussion of the risk for relapse and how using relapse prevention can lower that risk. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist invention such as this one. 

01:03:10
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention that discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 

01:03:15
DR. TIM BRUCE Another initial step in this relapse prevention approach is to distinguish between a lapse and relapse. A lapse is presented as a rather common, temporary setback that may involve, for example, re-experiencing strong anger in a situation, starting to ruminate about past slights, or reverting back to an aggressive response to a situation. Relapse, on the other hand, is described as a return to a sustained pattern of thinking, feeling, and acting that is characteristic of the anger control problem. The rationale for this distinction is that lapses do not need to develop into relapse if they can be caught and managed. This component of relapse prevention can be captured in a therapist intervention such as this one. 

01:03:55
2. Discuss with the client the distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with a temporary setback and relapse with a return to a sustained pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving that is characteristic of an anger control problem 3. Assist the client in identifying and listing situations in which the client is at greater risk of relapse; review previous situations that have been triggers for anger. 4. Identify and rehearse with the client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur. 

01:04:00
DR. ART JONGSMA Accordingly, high-risk situations that might make the client vulnerable to a lapse are identified. This discussion may be informed by past difficult experiences or anticipated new ones. Some examples include having an interpersonal conflict after not having had one for some time, noticing that a generalized state of anger is starting to return, having a stressful day, week or other period, and noticing that one's tolerance for frustration is lowering. 

01:04:30
DR. TIM BRUCE For the high-risk situations identified, the therapist leads the client in a rehearsal of using skills learned in therapy to manage them, including the skill of developing a tolerance for occasional thoughts and feelings while working on how to begin problem-solving them. Identifying and rehearsing the management of high-risk situations can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this one. 

01:04:55
5. Instruct the client to routinely use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., everyday application of calming, cognitive, and communication, and conflict resolution skills), building them into his/her life as much as possible. 6. Develop a "coping card" on which coping strategies and other important information can be kept (e.g., steps in problem-solving, positive coping statements, other reminders that were helpful to the client during therapy). 

01:04:55
DR. ART JONGSMA In addition to using skills learned in therapy to manage high-risk situations, clients are also encouraged to use strategies learned in therapy during their day-to-day life. Examples include everyday application of calming, cognitive, communication, and conflict resolution skills. The intervention now on your screen reflects this prevention emphasis in the treatment plan. Sometimes clients benefit from having a coping card or other reminder of important strategies and information regarding relapse prevention. If you decide to use this aid, it can be captured in the treatment plan by including this second intervention for objective number five. 

01:05:40
7. Schedule periodic maintenance or "booster" sessions to help the client maintain therapeutic gains and problem-solve challenges. 

01:05:40
DR. TIM BRUCE Finally, periodic booster sessions of therapy can help keep clients moving forward or problem-solve obstacles so clients are invited to periodically revisit therapy. The intervention for client objective number six describes the use of booster sessions in the treatment plan. 

01:05:55
DR. ART JONGSMA The table on your screen shows an example of how the therapist interventions we've just discussed could be incorporated into a psychotherapy treatment plan to help the client achieve the objective of learning and implementing relapse prevention strategies. 

01:06:15
DR. TIM BRUCE On your screen now appears an example of a final treatment plan that incorporates all of the steps of evidence-based psychotherapy treatment planning that we've presented in this program. It includes: the primary problem, behavioral definitions of the problem applicable to your client, the diagnosis or diagnoses, the long-term goal or goals of treatment, and short-term client objectives and related therapist interventions consistent with those of empirically-supported treatments, including those related to assessment, initial and ongoing psychoeducation, calming and coping strategies such as relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, communication skills training such as assertiveness training, and relapse prevention. 

01:07:10
More complete information on the Objectives and Interventions seen in this program can be found in the Workbook and Facilitator's Guide. 

01:07:15
DR. ART JONGSMA Today's discussion focused on evidence-based psychotherapy planning using goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with those found in identified, empirically-supported treatments and evidence-based treatment guidelines. As you can see, there's a significant body of research in this area. 

01:07:35
DR. TIM BRUCE As mentioned previously, the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of evidence-based psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health problems. It's designed to be informative in nature and does not intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about empirically-supported treatments, references to empirical support, clinical training materials, and training opportunities are provided in the companion workbook to this DVD. 

01:08:05
DR. ART JONGSMA We hope this information will help you in helping your clients live happy and productive lives.
