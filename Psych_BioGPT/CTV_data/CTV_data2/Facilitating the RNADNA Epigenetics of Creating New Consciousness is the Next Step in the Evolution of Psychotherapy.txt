She's suing me for custody of my inner child." Thank You for attending the 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference! The World is Largest Psychotherapy Conference Anaheim, California • 2013 Milton H. Erickson, M.D. (1901-1980) "Each person is a unique individual. Hence, psychotherapy should be formulated to meet the uniqueness of the individual's needs, rather than tailoring the person to fit the Procrustean bed of a hypothetical theory of human behavior." - Milton H. Erickson Erickson's parents and older siblings Dr. Erickson was plagued with enormous physical handicaps for most of his life. At age 17, he contracted polio and was so severely paralyzed that doctors believed he would die. While recovering in bed, almost entirely lame and unable to speak, he became strongly aware of the significance of nonverbal communication - body language, tone of voice, and the way that these nonverbal expressions often directly contradicted the verbal ones. He also began to have "body memories" of the muscular activity of his own body. By concentrating on these memories, he slowly began to regain control of parts of his body to the point where he was eventually able to talk and use his arms again. His doctor recommended exercising his upper body only so Milton Erickson planned a 1,000 miles canoe trip to build up the strength to attend college. His adventure was challenging, and although he still did not have full use of his legs at the end, he was able to walk with a cane.

RICK LANDIS Welcome to the Point/Counterpoint, uhm, with, ah, our presenter, Ernest Rossi, and our discussant, Cloé Madanes. Uhm, this is really a pleasure. I'm, ah, Rick Landis. I'm the Executive Editor of the Milton H. Erickson Newsletter. And, ah, Kathryn and Ernie, where, ah, featured in our newsletter as, ah, the power of two, powerful couple working together, creating something that is absolutely amazing. And, when you consider-- uhm, when I asked Ernie how I-- he wanted me to introduce him, he said, "Keep it brief." Ah, he now understands that, as I mentioned last time, that, ah, in the hour and a half we have, I usually can feel that, very easily just clearing my throat. Uhm, so, let me just say that Ernie is an, an amazing person. If you haven't met him, if you haven't heard him, you are really in for a treat. This man is more-- has more lifetime achievement awards that most of us have lifetimes. Ah, he's published 36 books, 175 papers on therapeutic, hypnosis, psychotherapy, dreams, conscientiousness, consciousness and creativity. And so, he's consistent with his recent book, Creating Consciousness: How Therapists can Facilitate Wonder, Wisdom, Beauty and Truth. Dr. Wisdom bring Dr. Wisdom. Dr. Rossi brings this unique questions to the conference of, are we developing a new science of consciousness, what is new about this science of consciousness, and is this new science of consciousness a harbinger of the future of the evolution of psychotherapy? As a discussant, we've got an amazingly here also, Cloé Madanesen-- Madanes, excuse me, I did that last time too. Innovator, teacher, family, therapy, brief therapy, one of the originators of the strategic approaches to family therapy, one of the central features, ah, central influences in my life in giving direction of working with families, author of seven books which are classics in the field, uhm, keynote presenter throughout the United States internationally, ah, can't say enough, so let me just say that what we're gonna be doing is having, ah, Dr. Rossi be giving-- ah, speaking for, ah, whatever time he chooses to, about an hours, what we used to it a lot, and then, ah, ah, Cloé will be giving some discussion, ah, about that. And then, you're free to ask them questions. And well, uhm, take note, when you give the questions, please come to the microphone over here, since this is being recorded. So, without further adieu, let me introduce bringing Dr. Ernest Rossi.

DR. ERNEST ROSSI Thank you for being here this morning. You must be the brave ones. The-- attracted to-- so esoteric, the title says, RNA, DNA epigenomics creating consciousness. 

00:05:10
Facilitating the RNA/DNA Epigenomics of Creating New Consciousness 2013 Evolution of Psychotherapy: Point/Counterpoint #6 • ΔObserving Consciousness • ΔMirror Neurons ΔGene Expression/Protein Synthesis Cycle • • ΔBrain Plasticity 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:05:10
DR. ERNEST ROSSI What can all of these possibly mean? I assure you, we're really following in the footsteps of Lao-Tzu, Buddha, Christ, we're following the footsteps of Einstein, Fermi, we're following the footsteps of whoever you really have the highest regard for. All of these people, the tradition that we're following is, what is consciousness, what is our highest and best level of functioning. All of the people you admire, all of the people you've studied have fold this question. Yet, today, we stand on their shoulders because we know something now that none of them knew, and that's profound what we're doing today, we're carrying out their tradition, we're standing on their shoulder and we're only as high as we are because we are standing on their shoulders of their own creative consciousness. So, let's begin with this fancy title, Facilitating RNA Epigenomics of Creating Consciousness. By the way, what does epigenomics mean? Well, it refers to our genome, but this isn't the old-time genetics of Mendel, couple hundred years ago, where you ca-- had sexual reproduction, you carry the heredity, the laws of heredity, it isn't that. Because brilliantly, that was-- it was also a bit narrow for the realities of the human condition. Epigenomics means everything that surrounds the genome, everything that surrounds the DNA, our genes. And what is this life's token, this RNA? What the RNA supposed to be? Label nucleic acid. Well, it's a precursor of DNA. And I'm gonna be talking more about this in a moment. But this first picture is our basic map. We begin on the top with observing consciousness. This where we all are right now. We're observing, we're aware. RNA is a very excitable signaling molecule. And if you're excited, if you are lurk and aware, RNA is active within you right now in the mirror neurons of your brain. We all know what our mirror neurons are, it began with research at the University of Panama about 15 years ago. We are part of the other universe, we, we mirror it. But that's not all what we're mirroring, we also mirror our inner world and the new idea about consciousness is. But there isn't something up there and just in a cognitive behavioral realm, but rather, it turns on RNA in the-- our brain cells, and that RNA turns on gene expression, the DNA. And that DNA makes a new kind of RNA, messenger RNA, that makes proteins, that makes up brain plasticity. And this new brain plasticity is the underpinning of new consciousness as it's taking place in us, right at this moment. Yes. We're creating consciousness with these new ideas, we are exploring.

CREATING CONSCIOUSNESS HOW THERAPISTS CAN FACILITATE WONDER, WISDOM, TRUTH & BEAUTY SELECTED PAPERS OF ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Volume 2, 2006-2012 EDITED BY KATHRYN LANE ROSSI 

00:10:10
DR. ERNEST ROSSI I hope to explore to be able to work the-- ah, here we go. Okay. So, this is the cover of one of the recent books, Creating Consciousness. But not the abstract. We're really interested how therapist comes large, any worker, greater of human consciousness, how we can facilitate wonder wisdom, truth and beauty. And this is not just a metaphor because there's a sense of wonder that catches here, and there's a big boost of curiosity, old boost of our consciousness that starts some RNA cooking in our brain neurons. This eventually is what is going turn on our genes to make new brain cells, new connections between brain cells that are gonna give us a new truth, a new consciousness, and this is beautiful. There's no separation between science and arts in this new view of consciousness, they are the same thing. Artists as well as scientists, their highest pleasure is ex-- exploring, have a new perception, a new sensitivity that gives squirt of what I'll be talking about in a moment or two. New neurotransmitters that heightened our consciousness, and it feels good. That's the gift of nature to us, that we're more growing at our optimal break, we're more on our creative edge, it feels good. And now, and so many of the politicians are saying, "Hey, what would the early human beings out of Africa to, to colonize a whole planet?" Well, it was a sense of venture, it was a sense of novelty, and this is what we're talking about. Novelty turns on gene expression, and gene expression makes-- allows the stem cells and develops stem cells, little brain to mature, and new networks that will encode, or new consciousness.

HEALING TRANSFORMATIONS A 100 YEAR PSYCHOLINGUISTIC STUDY DNA COGNITIVE MEDICINE MEDITATION PSYCHOTHERAPY PLACEBO HYPNOSIS 

00:13:10
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Oops. Okay. This is a 100-year map for Google's Ngram. You can look up Ngram in Google and find out how to make these cognitive maps. You'll notice that about in the middle or 1950, suddenly, there's a great spurt in the 5 million book archives that these words are tracking. DNA suddenly took off that music precursor, becoming more and more popular. It became even more popular than the word medicine. Wow! Look at that exhilarating curve. Yes, this is our current conscious, DNA, awareness of our genome, awareness of how we are living creatures that have inner resources and the ultimate inner resource is-- are DNA. But look here, another line going up, just slightly less popular than DNA, cognitive. So, this is what our current consciousness is about, and this is just as an scholarly books or research periodicals includes all human writing at different times of our history. And right now, the growing edge of consciousness, if you will, is-- centers around DNA and the cognitive. So, that's where we're going today. How do we put together the cognitive and DNA or genes, and I quote this like "healing transformations." Yes, DNA and the cognitive have healing implications. And look at the path of medicine, this is going up, but at the more least, or least seen se-- secure pace. One way you can look at this graph is what's pulling up medicine, DNA and the cognitive? Now, way, way far, far down, we see things like meditation, psychotherapy, placebo and hypnosis, much less popular today. And yet, this is where our field this day, most of us who are counselors, who are psychotherapists, meditation psychotherapy, placebo and hypnosis, they are just pan's holders for general concepts of what we do. And notice, how we're connected via the cognitive very close to DNA. This isn't just, ah, just an accident, I don't think it's an accident. I think it's the growing edge of our human consciousness is DNA and the cognitive, what we think about it. These twins are the growing edge of the consciousness of all of us in this room. 

00:17:05
RNA/DNA BIRD SONG DYNAMICS Micro RNAs RESPOND to THOUGHT 

00:17:10
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Now, let's get down to the profound research that's been done just in the past, half a dozen years about how consciousness evolves. It turns out that there's a specialist who study bird songs. Well, you know why, your senator, my congressman, might say, "Well, what's-- why are we putting so much money in the bird songs? Give me a break, you know what." Well, it turns out that bird songs are simple model for human cognition. essentially, we're all singing, I'm singing, they're singing going on. And that signaling-- singing, we've found out for the first time, just the couple of years ago, a neuroscient-- one of these bird song's specialists that, this is the first time we found the RNA's respond to thought. The story behind this is-- these are true finches, the same kind of birds that Darwin studied. The colorful one is the male, and the male can read their body language. The male is tweeting, tweeting, tweeting to a female. But the female seems to be holding back. "What kind of a song and dance is this guy given me? Where did the little fellow learn his song? Well, did he learn it from his daddy? Soon as he cracked out of the eggs, he heard his daddy singing and he started imitating his daddy. But you know, he's only little guy and he makes mistakes." Well, from human perception, we, we call them mistakes. From evolutionary history, we call them variations of be-- of behavior, adductive variations. This so-called mistakes become the signature or his personality. So, that's a nice lesson for us. Very often, when we make mistakes, hey, pay attention to the mistakes with a loving attitude because the mistakes really are a clue of what-- where our growing consciousness is. Mistakes are little pointers. So, if this young lady likes his song, likes the variations he's playing on song dynamics, she will follow him. Da-da-da-da, fly away with me, let's, of course, make a nest, make babies. How this has happened? Well, researchers now study the female's brain. Okay, oh, this guy tweets at her and where does the neural impulse go? And it goes to the auditory cortex, of course, and then, to pleasure centers or not so pleasurable centers. And, oh, where does it go then? Well, certain centers, the neurons, start vibrating, you might say resonating with the song. You know a song goes a wave on acoustic wave. And that acoustic wave is what turns on-- my goodness, it turns on RNA, the signaling molecule. So, this is a humble source of how the cognitive actually makes contact with the molecular, and that's our work today. How does our mind consciousness conduct with ultimately our DNA? Whilst through the messenger molecules that we call RNA, and there's thousands of different kinds of RNA. 

00:21:55
eRNA/DNA MIND & BABY SONG 

00:22:00
DR. ERNEST ROSSI And orchestrally, other researchers said, "Well, does this really happen with humans?" And when one beholds a certain RNA called eRNA, enhancer RNA, we find-- takes place between mother and human baby. Why do mothers of all cultures croon and sing, and talks smoothly and sweetly to her babies? She is singing apparently, "Itsy-bitsy spider, sat down beside her." Why do mothers do this, and why-- look at the eye contact, are they tuned into each other? And the baby is lifting his hand. He's aroused. He's in, in a tickling arousal. It's very precognitive arousal, but, oh, because he's really what her blaze from back in the womb of young new-born baby boy. Turn his head, when he hears his mother's voice. Welcome. Long story to make short-- work of it. This is how humans connect the cognitive that words of the song with the D-- RNA, the enhancer RNA. And what, what is it enhancing? Well, it's gonna enhance certain patterns of DNA gene expression. So, this is it. This is just a period within the past half of dozen years. Buddha didn't know about this, nor Lao-Tzu, nor even Einstein, or Heisenberg, or anyone you can think of that you admire. They did not know this part and they call it the philosoph-- philosopher says, the mind and the body are different realms, and narrow twain shall meet. So, we have a psychophysical parallels. Uhm, but this gives-- this is a thought, this is a theory that goes beyond that. Mind and body are communicating. The mind, the cognitive, has a 26-letter alphabet, the DNA has a four-letter alphabet seemingly more simple. And this is what we're doing with our clients. You sense yourself, tweeting to your clients, to your patients, or it is just the teenagers that tweet in their cellphones, Lady Gaga. We're humble for most part. We're not looking for millions of followers, we're happy that we have a few that will help us our new way thing. 

00:25:20
4-Stage Creative Process Novelty-Numinosum-Neurogenesis Effect 

00:25:25
DR. ERNEST ROSSI And if that baby grows up, then, we come to the four-stage creative process. This was my early work, my first paper to the Journal of Humanistic Psychology. I mean, one stage, one of the creative processes, the wheel sort of turning, you're curious. See, he's hands up, the way he's-- he's looking, he's curious about something. Then, he starts writing. In this case, trying to prove the Pythagorean theorem. All those two panels represent stage one. So many to work on the problem. And this is what all our clients are doing, they come to us when they are in crisis, when they're working in a problem and they don't know how to help themselves. And in middle panel stage show is-- one the artists make something humorous. Smoke is coming out of her brain. Oh, that's so humorous, smoke doesn't actually come out of the brain. What Leonardo da Vinci, centuries ago, said, when he talked about a seven-stage creative process, and he said, one of those stages toward the middle is what they call (inaudible ), it smokes, it gets hot. So, that was an intimation of inside the brain, something gets hot, some activity gets turn on. And then, in the idea of case, stage three clicks in, the flashing of white, the aha, the eureka experience, the epiphany. And so surprises, the student, she actually drops her pencil, "Wow!" And then stage four, she collects her wits and says, "Ah! Magic!" She forgets that's just a couple of moments before, she was in agony. Of course, this process sometimes takes centuries to solve Fermat's Last Theorem in, in mathematics. It was, well, 350 years ago that Fermat posts this intellectual theorem of mathematics. And it's only recently that a Princeton mathematician, Wiles is his name, who've created new mathematics that could prove Fermat's Theorem. Fermat has an intuition, and he's writing his script, I, ah, don't have enough room to write it down. But it took three and a half centuries to create a new, new mathematics that could really prove it. 

00:28:20
 We have to switch out your microphone, Ernest, so you're gonna use this one for a moment. 

00:28:25
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:28:25
 Okay. So, you go ahead and just speak, and listen, just keep going. Brilliant. 

00:28:30
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Are we hearing a little better now? 

00:28:35
 Would you agree, he's brilliant? 

00:28:35
 Yes. 

00:28:35
 Yey. Here you go. 

00:28:40
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:28:40
 So, up close in personal, ice cream cone. 

00:28:45
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Okay. My ice cream cone. 

00:28:45
4-STAGE RNA/DNA THEORY MIND/GENE DIALOGUES 1 Mind Crisis & Opportunities 2 eRNAs Mirror Neurons Intuition 3 HARs Epi-genomics Adapt & Heal 4 DRD4 Brain & Body Insight & Applications 

00:28:50
DR. ERNEST ROSSI So, here is another four-stage diagram just like the one we begin with, it's the same thing. And I'm going to show you a number of these because each diagram describes a different facade of the creative-- four-stage creative process. Up here, is mind, and mind means to a therapist, crisis/opportunity. People don't come and pay us for nothing. They are in a crisis. And what then we do, what is our basic skill to hear the mount of the crisis, and help facilitate change-- transforming that crisis into an opportunity. And of course, the ancients knew this. Remember the yin/yang, black and white circles? Yeah, they-- there's this yes/no, and like around and around. And this is what we do in the four stage creative process. It takes us typically an hour and a half or two to go from mind to RNAs, to DNAs, to making new protein and hopefully, getting a new bit of consciousness. So, this cycle takes place 12 times a day. Yes. Most of us are unaware of it. Notice in stage two, the mirror neurons, I call it, intuition, it's you get a hunch. This is like in stage two, when you get a hunch, could the answer be, could it be my mother, my father, my kids. That's what the curiosity, that trying to solve something-- starts turning on the eRNAs, and those eRNAs travel to other parts of the cell and they start turning on epigenomics. Not all the genes, but the human accelerator region genes. You know, you hear a common misconception, well, we're nothing but animals, we're nothing but monkeys, you know, we evolved. Well, just recently, Catherine Pollard and, ah, one of our university laboratories discovered that there's a certain region of the human genome, which we call the human accelerator region, that's missing, even in our closest primate relative, the chimpanzees. These are the special genes that one theory has helped us adapt and heal. This is epigenomics. It comes from signals from the outside, turning on these bushel human accelerator genes to make the messenger RNA that takes us to different parts of the brain and body. And this is where insight started to come in. Yes, we're making different, a new differentiation. Intuition is a hunch, you, you want to explore something. Insight, according to the way I conceptualize is, is something very different. Insight means you've done some work and now you've created a new piece of brain flash. And that brain flash is gonna be underpinning new consciousness. I also have a curious-- DRD4. What is that? That's a dopamine. This is just one example. It can turn on protein or messenger RNAs that make the protein, that make the neurotransmitter of dopamine receptor. And these are the receptors in the brain that are sensitive to novelty. That's a do-- a word that has many connotation, but this is what the neuroscientist says, "Gives positive motivation." For example, the great immigra-- migration out of Africa, they attribute to those who had this novelty sensitive gene that's the early humans-- these were the adventurous ones. And in this room, you are the adventurous ones of this conference, you really are that. 

00:34:05
RNA/DNA EPIGENETIC MIND/GENE DIALOGUES MIND CRISIS CREATIVE INTUITION Mirror Neurons eRNA IMPRESS Gene Expression DNA INSIGHT Brain Plasticity mRNA 

00:34:10
DR. ERNEST ROSSI This is another picture, the same thing. But here, I emphasized the intuition and the insight, but this again is the RNA epigenetic mind/gene dialogues. Let's take another look at it. 

00:34:30
RNA/DNA THEORY of EPIGENETIC MIND/GENE DIALOGUES Art, Beauty & Truth • Attention • Expectancy • Novelty/Numinous • Enrichment 1 Mind Crisis/Opps Bioinformatics • Auditory • Sensory • Perceptual • Motor 2 Mirror Neurons Intuition eRNAs Transcription • -2 Million Micro RNAs • Gene Modulation • Cellular Messengers 3 Genomic Adapt/Heal Gene Expression • DNA Sites -3 Million • Promoters • Transcription/Translation 4 Brain & Body Insight/Apps mRNA Translation • Proteins • Neurotransmitters • Hormones • 

00:34:35
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Ah, well, now finally, we got the whole theory with the little extra boxes, and I know you can't read it but in my hand-outs, you'll see this diagram. And then our new Erickson's collected works, this appears in volume 15 in part four, well, I try to update Erickson and the cognitive psychology updated by integrating it with RNA and DNA, brain and body plasticity. So, this why I think-- why I think hypnosis is so low on that earlier diagram I showed you. Most people with hypnosis, they don't know that they are dealing with DNA. And that's where with the-- I hope this whole congress-- what this all about? This is the growing edge of our psychotherapy, how we actually turn on molecules that will turn on the genes, that will make the new brain plasticity, that will create new consciousness. Note that this is a creative process. Yes, people have problems because there's been a breakdown in their creative process, it's a new way of looking at all of psychopathology. Diagnostic, meanwhile, fight the one that's just recently came out, a lot of controversy, how do we diagnose all the mental illnesses and so forth? Why the contro-- the con-- why controversy? Because the cognitive behavior language has ambiguities in it. I'm hoping that in sometime, not in the near future by the way, but someday, we're gonna be able to define all human states, the static and the creative as well as the psychopathological so-called in terms of these new RNA/DNA dynamics. 

00:36:55
ExRNAs: MIND.BODY Messengers? 

00:37:00
DR. ERNEST ROSSI And this is an artist rendition of-- my goodness, here's another kind of RNA, it's called Ex-- ExRNA. And I say, "Are these the mind/body messenger?" It's just been discovered recently that there are RNAs that flows to all the fluids of our body, even our saliva, our urine, our blood, or our lymph. And what are these extra, that's where the Ex come from, what are-- they're not just inside the cell communicating between the mirror neurons and the DNA inside the cell, no, these are mind/body messengers. So that today, we have articles in science saying, "Is there a social RNA? And, of course, there is." And for instance, Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, has a special new funding agency that's focused entirely on RNA. And, of course, that's medical. And this is the new face of what's called translational medicine, how do you translate from the laboratory to the bed side to actually administer what you discovered in the laboratory. And, so, this is the artist's picture of a protocell. Maybe 4 billion years ago, before we have life as we know it, we had an RNA world and there's some marvelous new books, and I note them in your handouts. And these are very, very authoritative molecular bowl which is, Darnell, Yarus, Atkins, and you'll find their books are packed. They're discovering-- they're deriving about for the first for texts, for medical students and advance research of Mr. Reed. And it's all about RNA world, how that came before the D-- the DNA. RNA was an excitable molecule and it could also emphasize itself. And that's what was mutated-- when RNA mutated, it mutated just one of its basis, ah, before, and it became DNA. And DNA was a very different kind of molecule, it was a very stable molecule. So, the new theory is that RNA evolve into our nervous system, and DNA became the memory molecule from one generation to the next. And the exciting growing edge is how RNA, the signals that come from the outside world or our thought and feeling, and cognitions, how they connect with the DNA to direct the DNA, to make the messenger molecules, to make the proteins that are going to release a neurotransmitter just for responsiveness to novelty and the whole human cognitive behavioral world.

WORK AWAKE ASLEEP & DREAM CIRCADIAN CYCLE AWAKE Performance Peaks Healing Responses Breaking Point Midnight Noon Midnight Clears Brain Toxins Clears Brain Toxins REM Dreams ASLEEP 

00:40:55
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Just two months ago, we had a new paper published in science, in, ah, one of the, ah, most simple science magazine and nature arbitrarily journals around the globe, and I get both of them every week, deliver to my home. A new research publication from my university researchers by the name of Xie. It's probably Chinese or-- maybe, I'm not pronouncing it correct, but this profound article helps us answer the question, "Why do we sleep?" It seems like why should that be a big question? Well, cuz we wanna rest, they had-- the body has to be built itself, you know. Yes, but, why do we sleep? Why do we need to rest? And that turns out-- and this particular article, it's a green part of the-- my diagram. I made this-- made this color code for it. When we sleep, the space between the neurons or brain widens. It gets 60% wider, so 60% more cerebrospinal fluid and a number of other fluids can go-- filter through our brain. And why? What is it doing there? Humble that might seen, it's cleaning up the garbage here, swashing the brain. One of the articles that-- about these researchers are, is this they turn housekeeper when we go to sleep? You are in contact with meditation schools that say, "Oh, when you go into meditation, just kind of refresh the mind." Enough to know people, that's a metaphor. But no, it's literally true. No, this is the-- without the colors, this is a diagram that I made back in 2002, my book, The Psychobiology of Gene Expression. Every night we go through about four or five periods of dream sleep, and that's where I put in this rainbow effect. Because dream sleep has activity as well as rest. When we're awake, the cycle continues only in a more variable form so, every hour and a half, we had a peak of performance we've had in this. I mean, you wake up in the morning, and how long it takes because you get down to brass tacks, studying or doing your job, it takes about an hour and a half. And your performance peak usually lasts about 20 minutes at its heightened. And then, we need to take a break, and I call these breaks, healing responses. So, every hour and a half, you heal a peak of activity intense and that's why I color it red. And then, you need to take a break, you need to take a couple of minutes break, have a coffee, take a little nurture use of restroom. So, ah, this is called the basic rest activity cycle. I edited two scholarly volumes with David Lloyd, a microbiologist in England, just about all these mind/body rhythm. And just before he died, I had my last sessions with Erickson, and I asked him, why his sessions lasted an hour and a half. And he said, "Oh, well, you know, you just-- you need a good piece of time to get something done." And then I asked him the, was he aware of this basic rest activity cycles also one hour in a half, just like the length of his sessions? And he said, "No, have you ever heard of ultradian rhythms which is another name for this same thing?" "No." Then I speculate it, I said, "Dr. Erickson, is it possible that your unusual effectiveness especially in psychosomatic mind/body problems is due to the fact that you've picked out the natural parameter of mind/body communication?" If you have a client for an hour and a half, have the hour and a half, remember, they go from mind to gene, you're bound to hit either a peak or throat. And maybe this is debate, your healing is more than just words, you're tuning into some basic biology. And the truth is, tears came to eyes, most-- for most of us, this is what, what we called epiphany, a sudden insight. What? Could this be the biology behind Erickson's therapeutic? Hypnosis, that's a speculation, but that's what I've done with this new research that shows when we sleep. We're actually clearing the brain. I'm saying that every hour and a half, you get a many sleep, you need to take a many break, and by time you get the late afternoon it's called breaking point, and then, there's a massive shift of gene expression, all by itself, a shift from those genes that enhance your outer world activity to the gene itself, focused on nurture and opening up those brain spaces so you can clear your brain for the next day. So, this is a new theory of hypnosis, this is a new theory of meditation. Why do-- what do hypnosis and meditation have in common? Well, it's-- there's a stillness. Erickson called it catalepsy. He'd lift the hand gently, and the hand would stay there with still, and we call this a catalepsy, meaning, still. Profound research into the molecular genomics of meditation found that, yes, meditation does turn on gene expression. And just recently, some researchers and mentally abuse my creative psychosocial genomic healing experience, my effort to encode Erickson's practice in a neat little package, that's easy to learn. And we also found that hypnosis-- this brightened hypnosis that's a lot of people to explore with stillness also turn on-- turns out 200 genes, or so. And tomorrow by the way, or whether-- my next workshop 28, I'll be introducing Dr. Cozzolino from the University of, ah, Salerno, who did this original research. So, here we have a new theory of why we sleep the alternating cycles of peak activity and rest. And I hope-- I will show in my demonstration later this afternoon how I use this way so-called hypnotic induction.

00:49:25
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Here's another picture of the same thing, but this time it's restricted to 120 minutes. This is our typical basic rest activity cycle. Stage one, you collect data, there's a stage for arousal. Stage two, incubation, any truly new piece of work is invariably once in the conflict and negative experiences. But if you stay with it, you go to a period of private inner working creative replay. You go around and around a cycle of gene expression, from mind to gene. And then, if you're lucky, you have the head of stage three and, "Oh, what a relief." And with that, relief comes through relaxation. And then you have the verb in the outside world. So, this is almost the opposite of how the typical hypnosis people work. They want you to relax in the beginning, but, no, relax, and as an artificial suggestion, actually, if that works for you, you have a solo work with relaxation at the beginning, go for it because if there's a lot of cues that people experienced just coming into your waiting room. But really, the cycle begins with arousal, turning on to genes. This activity, this is act but the ge-- but this is called activity-dependent gene expression. They also collect experience-dependent gene expression. Both words an activity and its experience is actually what turns on your genes. So, as I said earlier, this is not your old Mendelian genomics. This epigenetics. We get semi-line from the outside including suggestion, hypnosis and all the fields of psychotherapy. What it be all doing? They're turning on those mirror neurons and turning on the RNA, and the RNA is turning on the DNA, and that's making new protein, and that's new proteins become the neurotransmitters and the healing factors or hormones that become the underpinning, or a new piece of flashing your brain, where you get a connection between your will, your consciousness and your genes. Einstein didn't even know this. Lao-tzu didn't. All of these ancient and more modern message acting accord with this, but they did not know that this was the actual mo-- what the molecular machine really was behind the creative process.

eRNA/DNA MIND/BODY THEORY OXFORD NANOPORE MinION, SALIVA & LAPTOP 

00:52:40
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Da-da-da-da. This is Oxford nanopore and what they called the MinIon. It's a little rectangle that fits in the palm of your hand. You take any few drops of any fluid that could bring your saliva, urine or blood. You put them inside and then you connect it with your laptop, and then, automatically, it analyzes your gene expression in terms of RNA and DNA. They just made it available this last month. I put in my-- it only costs $1,000. In other words, it comes do-- come down for a multimillions of dollars for their original gene sequences. I'm wondering, will a day come when the client comes and you-- they put a drop of saliva under with MinIon, and you plug it in and then you begin your session and then, the computer starts dragging away, contrasting the cloud where all the expert research from around the globe has a database. What do these expression of these genes, these RNAs, what implication is part of psychological functioning. And then, couple of minutes before the end, once again, you put it in a saliva sample, and charge, charge, charge, charge, reach the cloud. And now, you compare what was the client's RNA/DNA profile before therapy, and what, was it after therapy. Can you imagine a more precise evidence-based psychotherapy? Are some of you covering a neuro boost because-- ah, if your payments are gonna be depended upon how will this profile shift, oh, you've, ah, I mean, we-- we're gonna start separating out, what? But this-- you could say this is like being broader. I don't believe this gonna happen in all lifetime. But I've kept wondering if device isn't use as long waiting list. And I'm in private practicing one that get them out to laboratories. First, ah, it might be takes some time, but I believe this is a new technology that can verify the RNA/DNA theory of creative consciousness. And theory is no good, unless you have a way of proving it true and false, actually theory can be a guide even without the test like modern string theory and quantum dynamics, but this is a classical model. Do you have a test for your theorizing? So, Cloé, I have the theory, I have at least in principle, a test, what do you make of all these? 

00:56:20
[sil.] 

00:56:40
CLOÉ MADANES I was just asking Kathryn, Mrs. Rossi, where I could buy that device. That's the first thing I want to do with on one of those. I now have the jawbone, and when I'm writing-- this is a thing that measures your idle time and the steps that you walked, and when I write-- I'm writing this thing considers I'm idle. And so, it tells me, "You've been idle for more than 90 minutes, get up." It's interesting. And actually, I do have that cycle of 90 minutes. So, every 90 minutes, whatever I'm writing or reading, or whatever I'm doing, sitting down, I stop and I have a break, and it just comes naturally to me. So, I have to go this, that I read Dr. Rossi's papers several times, while Googling words that I have never heard before. Ah, I don't think I understood everything in the paper. Kathryn was telling me then, I would understand much better and listening to him. And that's true, because now, I get it much better. There's a huge difference. Uhm, but I think I grasp the importance of the research and the implications for every field of human endeavor. And as I was saying, one of the things that struck me is the importance of alternations between performance stress and healing, in work and in everyday life. So, I'm also very interested in the four stages of the creative process, the initiation, the incubation, the aha! and the verification. Dr. Rossi proposes that the stages are experienced 12 times a day. I propose that these four stages are also experienced in the process of on-going therapy over days and weeks. There is a period of initiation when the therapist proposes a new idea, asks a pointed question, gives an interpretation, refrains the situation or gives a derogative. Then, there is a period of incubation when the client reflects processes and experiences something different. Third, comes the aha! moment when the client realizes that something has changed. His thoughts, emotions, desires are different. And finally, there is a verification when change happens in the client's life and relation-- and in the client's relationships, and the therapist verifies that things are now different. So, let me tell you the story of the case that illustrates these four stages over a period of several weeks. So, let's call this client, Bruce. Bruce had been court ordered to therapy for various offenses, including violence against his girlfriends, multiple counts of driving under the influence, possessions of narcotics and intent to distribute evading child support, and attempted murder. He was 29 years old, but appeared to be over 40. The therapist was about the same age as Bruce, and I was the supervisor, observing behind the one-way mirror. Bruce came into their first session looking raged, unshaven and dirty. The first thing he said as he walked in was, "I hit the bitch again." Knowing that he was on probation and could go back to jail for this. I thought to myself, "This guy is making a deliberate effort to be as awful as he possibly can. He must have an interesting history." So, I called the therapist on the intercom and said, "Ask him to tell you the story of his life." Soon we knew that his father was president of a Fortune 500 company. The father collected race cars and Bruce grew up in that environment. The father was a cruel, angry man who would take Bruce regularly to the races and insult him in front of his friends. Nevertheless, Bruce wanted to be a professional car racer. But when he turns 16, he ran away from home for a few days to a friend's house. And when he returned, he found that the father had sold all the cars and he would never be able to race. So, he became a motorcycle racer instead, and began his life of delinquency. He had many motorcycle accidents and was hospitalized many times. Brut-- Bruce explained all these in a tone of tough, hardened indifference. I called the therapist and said, "We have to get him to experience love. Do the meditation on the mother." The meditation on the mother is a Buddhist's meditation that I have, ah, adapted to therapy. You say to the client that everyone has a spiritual mother. The spiritual mother is the person who has given to you more selflessly and generously in your life. It could be your biological mother, grandparent, teacher, friend, it could be a man or a woman. Now close your eyes and visualize that person and tell me who it is. Think of all the ways she has given to you and feel her love. Then, think about how the spiritual mother must have other spiritual children to whom she has also given selflessly. And think about how she, herself, was the spiritual child of another spiritual mother who gave to her selflessly. In Buddhism, because of the belief in reincarnation, you can expand this to include everyone in the world. In therapy, you don't need to do that. You can stop after the first couple of steps. So, the explanation of the meditation on the mother was the initiation stage of the therapy. So, when Bruce closed his eyes to visualize his spiritual mother, he immediately said, "It's my grandmother. She always defended me against my father. She gave me everything. She was the only one that visited me in the hospital." And as he said this he began to cry. This was the incubation stage of the therapy. The therapist asked him, why he was crying. And he said it was because she was now very old and he hadn't visited her in a long time. The therapist asked, "Why?" And he said, because if he visited her, he had to bring her a present and take around to dinner. And he didn't have any money because he wasn't won the game. The therapist said, "I'm sure your grandmother would love a visit from you without the dinner and the present." Bruce answered, "No, that's the way I have to do it. I have to get a job." He stood up and said, "I have to go. I'm going to look for a job." And he left. This was the aha! stage of the therapy. He came back two weeks later, clean and well-dressed, he had a job, had visited the grandmother and given her idea despise a gift, and taken her out to dinner. He was very pleased with himself. The therapist asked Bruce to bring the grandmother to the next session so she could advise him on how he could best help Bruce. She came to the next session and then we got her to bring her sons, Bruce's father and uncle, to the next session. With her help, the therapist convinced the two men to set up Bruce in a business as a sort of reparation for the way they had treated him growing up. This happens successfully over the course of a few months, and Bruce discarded his delinquent identity, rejoined his social class and reconciled with his father. This was the verification stage of the therapy. So, when I'm going to think conclusion is that everything in the world consists of patterns that repeat. So, the four stages of the creative process that can take place in a couple of hours repeat in the course of therapy over many weeks and in the course of our lives. So, thank you, Dr. Rossi, for brilliant presentation. Thank you very much.

RICK LANDIS Uhm, this is the time now, we've got a few minutes left for some brief questions. It's your time against here. Ah, is anyone have a question? If you do, then, please come to the microphone. 

01:06:15
 Uhm, ah, subject matter that I'm interested in studying more about is birth, and specifically, birth trauma, but the whole subject matter of birth and how it affects the brain of the developing human. And I'm wondering if you could say something about gene expression and like the newborn, the brain of the newborn, the brain in utero, and maybe some of the differences that occur in gene expression and the brain of a newborn versus an adult, or if the birth is particularly traumatic, how it might change gene expression. 

01:06:55
RICK LANDIS Thank you. 

01:07:00
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Well, in the womb, of course, there's incredible high activity of gene expression and brain plasticity. But then, that happens in human development as well, around four or five, there comes a new peak of brain plasticity gene expression as a child starting to go to school, learning to read, write. And then again, in adolescents, there's a new peak, a new height of brain expression, brain plasticity. And some people are now saying, "Hey, the brains really not mature until you're 40." So, in your 40s you go to another extraordinary period of brain plasticity and potential for new consciousness. When I had a stroke, 12-- 10, 12 years ago, I was 50 pounds heavier than I am now. But it took me a long time to recover, and how did I recover? Well, I conti-- I began taking piano lessons, novelty things, I began trying to write and I've-- the first paper I've published was Art, Beauty and Truth where the corners of this new theory that I presented today. And by the way, you have that in your handouts, that would be the most concise, but in other words, all of rehabilitation is basically how to facilitate this RNA/DNA cycle. Now, as for our generation to get the details of this, and that's what Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, he is funding this, he is funding this to the max trying to find out how this place and everything from autism and Alzheimer's to physical traumas. So, this is on-going research. I believe it's the answer to your questions. 

01:09:35
 Thank you. 

01:09:35
KATHRYN ROSSI Additionally with that, that with, uhm, in utero and with newborns, there's-- there's, uhm, an abundance of, ah, neurons that have not been specified yet, and there goes through the pruning process. The important thing to take away with you is that, that continues to happen over a lifetime where you're sprouting and you're pruning. And so, for babies that are born with difficulties, maybe with the birth traumas and with not, there are still fantastic opportunities for, ah, full lives. About 100 years ago, I worked with, ah, newborn babies, born addicted to drugs, and I was amazing that under great care of foster parents by the time that these children were aged five, you could not tell the difference between them with the severe traumas and a regular 5-year-old. And so, the idea of what nurturing does, of how it grows the neurons and pairs the neurons, and then prunes the neurons, is really exciting. And so, I just wanna give you tons of hope. 

01:10:45
[sil.] 

01:10:50
 Uhm, Dr. Rossi, I become fascinated with, ah, heart MAF and the connection of kind of breathing into the heart center and how that connects with everything, and I'm curious of what you think about the, the actual DNA connection with the, the heart center to your theories. 

01:11:15
[sil.] 

01:11:20
DR. ERNEST ROSSI So, let's-- can you summarize that Kathryn for me? 

01:11:20
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes. Uhm, Ernest has unique hearing, but he can always hear me. It works out well. So, uhm, ah, that her question is very beautiful. Uhm, that, you know, that, ah, she would like to know in, in-- when you think of the heart center, the, you know, anahata, you know, the - 

01:11:40
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

01:11:40
KATHRYN ROSSI - this, this, this chakra. Anahata actually, in Sanskrit means, unstruck. It's really the space between the heartbeats in that beautiful chakra area, and, ah, there's practices of breathing in the heart. And she's curious if there's anything you can say about DNA or even better, RNA, as it rela-- relates to, ah, the center, the, the heart. 

01:12:10
 Perfectly expressed. 

01:12:10
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Of course, there's a RNA/DNA connection to the heart center. There's-- we've established many disciplines, psychosocial variables and even yoga spiritual, yoga as Kathryn practices it. They are turning on gene expression. As a matter of fact, any technique that you are using, it's really not going to be validated until you do the research in an RNA/DNA level. This is the common denominator of all the so-called chakras, all the states of consciousness, all the states of trauma illness, all the states of recovery. This is the underpinning. The problem is, we need a vast army of people, molecular biologists, bio-informatics people, the biology of information in the body. Where are these people? We have to train them. But, we, I believe, are the last generation of, what? Classical psychotherapy that was independent of what was really going on in the molecular bio-- levels. So, your question is profound, but, yes, it's gonna take a couple of generations of research. 

01:13:45
 Thank you. 

01:13:45
RICK LANDIS Thank you. I think I had a question. And that is, ah, Dr. Rossi, you had mentioned that, ah, there's, ah, social RNA. And one of the studies that I read, that I found fascinating, ah, and how they got a grant for this, I have no idea, but, ah, they discovered that, that first kiss, and you get that not all the time, but every once a month, you get that up and down the backbone and you just go limp, and it's like that was amazing. That it turns out with those people, they have different natural immunities in their-- in their DNA. Those people who have the same natural immunities don't get that flatter. Do you know any other social interactions in which, uhm, RNA maybe influencing our choices of mates and how-- and making babies? 

01:14:45
DR. ERNEST ROSSI It's just a matter of has anyone decided to do research on RNA/DNA basis of any state of consciousness, any states of relationship. So this theory is not broad and saying, all of the psychodynamic methods have a basis in this new language between RNA/DNA and our mind. So, we could-- each of you probably has a question, well, what about this, could this be, and if you're interested in it, you're probab-- we could probably be sure that yes, it-- if it's infective, if it modulates emotions, feelings, cognition, perception, relationships, all of those are adaptive responses to the outside and inside world. They're all the basis-- this is the new epigenomics, this is the new basis of all psychology. So, you asked me, Ernie Rossi, are you a genius in touched with everything that's in the cloud, all of the research. Because if this is going up to the cloud, you know, the imaginary cloud, it's a super humor-- super computer that's actually blend base. But the ethics of publication and its field now is, some journalists won't accept your molecular genomic research on this, you send it up to the clouds. So other people can check it. 

01:16:30
RICK LANDIS All Right. 

01:16:30
DR. ERNEST ROSSI So, we don't get into message with our fake data and so forth. One message that just came up was 23andMe, 23 refers to the 23 chromosomes, and they did all-- it's about, I guess, about 10 years ago, they first birth on the scene. I send them my saliva sample, $1,000 to be coded. Now, by the way, it only costs $99. 

01:17:05
RICK LANDIS Yeah. 

01:17:10
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Popular price. But now the FDA is coming down hard on them saying, "What claims are you making, what research can you cite?" Now, ah, 23andMe, I was impressed because they did a lot of researches, on-going research and everyone that puts their data into 23andMe becomes a piece of a bigger and bigger cloud. But this is the difficulty, in other words, this isn't a small little theory off in the corners. This underlies all of the questions we have about psychology, consciousness, behavior, relationship. How about a couple that's happily married and has a wonderful sex life, will they have a different profile than an unhappily married couple? I'm sure, they will. Just-- but that's only on the intuition. It hasn't going through the experimental test or to the DNA transcription/translation cycle. That's what they call it, technically. The RNA turns on the DNA, that's transcription, it transcribes, what? It transcribes situations in the outside world as well as the inner world. Then the genes, the DNA makes the proteins through this messenger RNA, and now, it's called translation. We've translated psychosocial stimuli via our dreams, our genes and dreams, yes, that's right, dreams things will have-- that's why in my diagram, I showed the multicolored screen, it's called the transcription/translation. Look at the meaning of those words. These were just merely molecular biologist who discovered with lots and great, got the Nobel Prize with this. They said that biology isn't biology, it's an information exchange and you have to just like you have a luxury, you have to transcribe it into the written world and then, we have to translate it into different human languages. The adapted language from the cognitive behavioral world to explain molecular action. Do you see how profound that it's up to now, it was the reductive? First, you send the molecules and then the molecules made such and such until finally made the brain and then, they will get consciousness. But to explain this, they actually had to use the metaphors of transcription/translation. That is what we are doing with our clients every session. They are transcribing to us, hoping we have the apathy through our mirror neurons that pick something that's important, and there are mirror neurons. And then, we go through a therapeutic procedure so we can translate it into a new mode of functioning, and that's why they have that new term translational medicine. All of medicine ultimately is based in this transcription/translation process. The new brilliant thing that's happening in our generation is we're seeing a connection between all these deepest biological levels with our cognition, with our perception, with, what I called, art, beauty and truth, in the first people I wrote about five or six years ago on this. 

01:21:15
RICK LANDIS Thank you very much. We have time for one brief question. 

01:21:20
KATHRYN ROSSI Oh, you know what, there's some people that had been standing over there. 

01:21:20
RICK LANDIS Oh! I didn't noti-- notice over there. I'm sorry about that. Yes? 

01:21:25
 I don't-- oh, it is okay. A quick question, ah, for Dr. Rossi, uhm, an example or summary of an induction that begins with arousal and concludes with relaxation, could you just say a little more about that, and describe that? 

01:21:40
DR. ERNEST ROSSI I didn't hear that. 

01:21:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes, again, I will, ah, help Ernie. Uhm, that he has a very interesting question about inductions, and he wondered, well, how do you start out with an induction of, uhm, of activity, of stimulation and then, when do you add the relaxation aspect in, in induction? 

01:22:05
DR. ERNEST ROSSI Yes. This is what I call implicit processing heuristics. Implicit is a neuroscientist term for the unconscious. So, I'm saying, how do I facilitate certain-- ultimately, biological processes, how do I do that? I begin by recognizing there's a connection, there's a language connection between my words and turning on the RNA and the DNA, and so forth. But I don't do inductions like that, I don't presume to be the director of my therapeutic session. I simply tune in, I use my mirror neurons to sense where is the person in the four-stage creative process, where are they? Are they-- like Erickson described, well, some clients come in and, you know, they pace up and down the room, and gradually, you talk to them and direct their pacing, and that's how you presumably got control of their behavior. I'm not so intelligent, I don't presume to direct, but I'm a very sensitive guy. When I was a little kid in grammar school, all the bigger kids beat up on me, and they wanted me to fight sentimentally, it's smaller kid than me and that son of a goat, who could hit hard and so I would run. I became very sensitive, so sensitive, that I have an extreme empathy with all states of illness, all states of rehabilitation, and that's why I depend upon. So, if a person comes in and they say, there's the press, it's like a demonstration I did yesterday at this congress. She's oppressed, she feels like she's a prisoner. Fine, I say, how wonderful. That, of course, is the prognosis describing negative symptoms. But I would say, hey, wow, it is wonderful because your already in stage two, that's the characteristic of stage two, feeling you're in depression, feeling you're in anxiety. So I said, can-- tell me, what's-- and I have a long, a detailed procedure that I called the creative psychosocial of genomic healing experience. You'll find it in-- by a break out heuristics like creative consciousness book. I say, okay, can you-- what's your both hands and it really feels like you're a child or an adult. From primary, it get down to the crucial question, which hand is really the depressed and anxious one, and what do you feel, in the other hand, I pause, ah, what's the opposite of the symptomatic behavior? I never help pursing Florida symptomatic behavior, until I put it in the safe context. And this procedure, automatically, what's the opposite of any symptom? Well, I wrote a book years ago, years ago, called the Symptom Path to Enlightenment. Expressed your symptoms here and then here, the opposite. Well, what's gonna be the opposite? It's gonna be some kind of a meliorative therapeutically potential process. And then, when they say, "Yeah, I got it." Experiencing both at the same time, I say, "Wonderful." Now, I want you to continue tuning in and let's see what happens between those two parts of your brain. And then they go through motions idea that make movements and I support what they're going through. In other words, I consolidate a relationship between the symptoms and the possible inner resources. They are capable of healing that. And I've worked with people never really finding out what the source of their pain was, are there on-going psychological problems, just by the simple procedure. So, they go through the four-stage creative process, one you consolidated. That's called consolidating the opposites. Anytime, pe-- people present you with the pa-- paradox, something that's the opposite, that's a profound opportunity because the opposites are like a circle that connects and it's all connected from mind to mirror neurons and genes, and new brain plasticity. So, I engender a greatest state in my client. I don't presumed to have the answers, I'm a facilitator of their creative process, and after a couple of sessions, they get the idea they can be experiencing on one level of this positive and this negative. And on another level, they can have an observer self, observing and occasionally talking to me, and some will go into memories, all the psychodynamics. 

01:27:35
KATHRYN ROSSI And we welcome you to come and join us at our, ah, workshop at one o'clock. We'll be doing three-quarters. The workshop will be experiential. 

01:27:40
RICK LANDIS And which makes it a very good time, and my apologies for those of you who are standing for questions. Please join at that one. I think that, ah, many of your answers will be experienced. I wanna thank Cloé very much. Yeah.
