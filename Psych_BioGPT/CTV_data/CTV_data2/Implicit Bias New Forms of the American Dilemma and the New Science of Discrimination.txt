Please welcome Dr. Greenwald. 

00:00:30
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Ah… I’m… I’m very pleased to have been invited here. I think many of you are aware that this is an audience to which I would hope that the work I have been doing speaks in particular and it’s an audience that I don’t get a chance to mix with. I’m going to be talking about some things that are relatively new. I think and I’ve made clear what’s new and I hope to leave time for discussion, questions at the end, ah… because I’m talking about some stuff that I haven’t put into talks before and because this audience has perspectives that ah I don’t get enough exposure to. I’m actually hoping that the… I get some questions that I have never heard before, that’s, that’s really the most interesting possibility for me. If I… when I get a question, I haven’t heard before ah, I sometimes will say excellent question, which means usually that I don’t have a clue as to what the answer is. I don’t say excellent question routinely as, as some of colleagues do. 

00:01:45
Overview Myrdal’s (1944) conception of the American Dilemma Myrdal’s optimism for America’s racial future The “implicit” revolution in Psychology The Implicit Association Test (IAT) IAT evidence: validity, controversy A changed understanding of discrimination The American dilemma reconceived Applying the implicit revolution to diversity goals 

00:01:50
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Um, so here’s… here’s what I’m planning on doing. Ah, starting from Gunnar Myrdal’s conception of the American dilemma. Describe that briefly, talk about his optimism for America’s racial future mistaken optimism. The implicit revolution in psychology which is where my work fits. In particular, the implicit association test, I will demonstrate a form of that for you I hope that I will choose one that you haven’t experienced before for those (inaudible ) have, ah experience some IATs before and I want to talk about briefly about some of the evidence for the validity of the IAT and some of the controversy surrounding it. Then, on a show how this work leads to a changed understanding of discrimination and that’s, that’s a new part of this and the, this also wanna talk about how this new work on implicit cognition leads to thinking about the American dilemma that Myrdal described somewhat differently, and then, at the end I think I’ll have a little time to talk about applying this work to diversity goals including its use in diversity training. Sometimes, I’ll be talking about we referring to the people doing the research and this is not elevating myself to royalty.

ANTHONY G. GREENWALD This is a reference to my academic family, Mhazarin Banaji who I’m very proud of now, not only professor of Harvard, but President of the association for psychological science was by Ph.d. advice, he 25 years ago ah at Ohio State University and ah… the one on the right is my academic grandson Brian Nosek who was Mahrzoos(ph) that’s Mahzarin, Mahrzoos(ph) student at Yale who when he started as a graduate student, ah immediately grabbed on to the IATs something to do research with and he has been doing some of the best research with it since and I’m glad to say, I’m still collaborating with both of them. 

00:04:15
Gunnar Myrdal (1944) An American Dilemma Statement of the dilemma A conflict between America’s democratic (all-created-equal)ideals America’s poor treatment of the American Negro 

00:04:15
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Here is Myrdal’s cover of an American dilemma, here is the statement of the dilemma as Myrdal conceived it. It’s a conflict between two things that’s what a dilemma is America’s democratic meaning all people created equal ideals and America’s poor treatment of the American Negro. You may notice that this is stated not in psychological terms, ah Myrdal was an economist. Most of the research was done by sociologist on an American dilemma. This is stated as a society level conflict. I don’t know, I… in the 1500 or thereabouts pages of American dilemma, I actually don’t know if this was talked about as a conflict existing inside the head, but the way it is generally described these two things in the conflict are not necessarily represented inside the head of each and every American and needn’t be for this conception, be both represented in any individual American for it to be the kind of conflict that Myrdal was talking about as you might guess, I’m part of my re-conception of this is to talk about how it is represented inside the head. Myrdal was optimistic and here is a quote which I’m gonna read a few sentences from, from ah, forward to 20-year Anniversary Edition of an American Dilemma written by sociologist, Arnold Rose and it’s interesting that this was written shortly before the passage of America’s major Civil Rights Laws, but and, and before Lyndon Johnson was President, which was the period, at which there were serious action on America’s Civil Rights Laws. I’ll just pick out a few sentences. There could be no doubt that the races were moving rapidly toward equality and desegregation by 1962. Prejudice as an attitude was still common, but racism as a comprehensive ideology was maintained by only a few. I think that was probably a controversial statement at that time, but as you know, I only got my Ph.D. in 63, so I wasn’t reading this at that time. I venture to predict, this is Arnold Rose writing in 1962 the end of all formal segregation and discrimination within a decade. Now that’s, that’s actually ah prescient because this was before the laws were passed and if you think that the laws where had the objective of ending formal segregation and indiscrimination, he was predicting that change in the laws, ah but as you’ll see, he thought it would have more effect on the society and the decline of the informal segregation and indiscrimination, so that would be, so that these would be a mere, mere shadow in two decades. Undoubtedly, he was being influenced by the, then 8-year-old Brown versus board of education decision by the Supreme Court, ah that was something that led to a lot of optimism that as we all pretty well know turned out not to be realized. These changes would not mean, this is Rose continuing “These changes would not mean that there would be equality between the races within this time, for the heritage of past discrimination would still operate to give Negroes lower “life changes.” Okay, so he was in touch with that, but he then goes on to say “But the dynamic social forces creating inequality will, I predict be practically eliminated in three decades.” Okay, 62 plus 30, 92, ah that was 19 years ago now. Ah, it didn’t happen. But there is some relevant evidence and you I’m sure as I’m you’re well aware that, that people like Dinesh D'souza and Tony Snow who was George W. Bush’s press secretary said that racism is just a bad memory. D'souza said you know you hear a lot of talk about it. You just don’t see it anymore. And they were pointing to some evidence that was real evidence and so ISR Gallup(ph) National Opinion Research Center conducted serial surveys in which the same questions were repeated every few years between 1960 and…and the present. 

00:09:40
Key evidence: 1960-2000 Survey question suggesting a decline in race prejudice Do you think White students and Black students should go to the same schools or to separate schools? Do you think that White people have a right to keep Blacks out of their neighborhoods if they want, and Blacks should respect that right? 

00:09:40
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Here is one of them. Do you think white students and black students should go to the same schools or to separate schools? Question about segregation in schools. Do you think white people have a right to keep blacks out of their neighborhoods if they want, and should respect that right? Again a question, of this about residential segregation. Now, here are the survey results over 40 years and the upper line here shows the responses to the question about school segregation and ah, sixth basically this is opposition to segregation and 60% around in mid 60’s climbing to near 100% what in mid 90s that I’m pretty sure this questions actually now not used anymore, because the response rate is so high. People are on National Surveys as this representative of the American population are saying um, the school segregation is wrong. This is the one about the residential segregation and the question again was why people have a right to keep Negroes black African-Americans that wording changed over the years out of their neighborhood if they want and Negroes Blacks African-American should respect that right. Ah, this is disagreeing with that statement meaning favoring the segregation, residential desegregation and that’s risen from below 40% favoring residential desegregation to over 80% in that, in that very. So this is, these are data that support ah perhaps the optimistic interpretation that Rose and, and would lead some to say that ah, that optimism has been born out. 

00:11:30
Survey questions suggesting no decline in race prejudice. Do you think that government in Washington should make every possible effort to improve the social and economic position of Blacks and other minority groups? Do you think that Blacks have been discriminating against for so long that the government has a special obligation to help improve their living standards? An IAT to measure implicit age bias 

00:11:35
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD But then, there are some other survey questions suggesting no decline in, or no change in racial attitudes at the same time as you have got those questions. Here is one. Do you think that government in Washington should make every possible effort to improve the social and economic position of blacks and other minority groups? Do you think that Blacks have been discriminated against for so long that the government has a special obligation to help improve their standards? These are questions about approval of government assistance to African-Americans and other minorities. And there is no change in these and this isn’t these numbers above 60% odd numbers indicating approval of government assistance. These are numbers indicating disapproval of government assistance and this that if anything was rising ah, slightly in, in recent years. Ah, but there are other types of evidence, and I’m sure, you’re aware of, of some of these, I’ll give you a quick list. 

00:12:40
• Research on “modern”(symbolic, aversive)racism • Many audit studies (housing and employment) • Health Care disparities • Experimental studies of racially biased help-giving using unobtrusive measures • Police profiling • Employment discrimination • The 2008 election • Research using implicit measures • The Implicit Association Test 

00:12:40
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD There is research on what’s either called modern racism and symbolic racism, aversive racism, subtle prejudice, these are all terms that actually where inspired by the patterns in part by the pattern shown on that last slide, which is the lack of change, in… in support for government assistance and led to the redesign of questions measuring racism in the modern racism scale is the best know of those. There are many audit studies, these started in the 60s informally I think in the 1950s but they became national studies, ah shall and these, these are the kinds of studies in which paired testers were matched as well as they can be on all characteristics usually paired black and white are paired. Hispanic and white testers are send out to the same places asking in the case of housing if an apartment or house is available and in the case of employment, going to apply for a job and those show continuing discrimination against African-Americans and Hispanics over the years as these have been done. Some evidence of a bit of decline and discrimination in some of the more recent audits, but it is still pretty healthy. Health care disparities. This is pretty well known data that was report called unequal treatment by the National Institute of Medicine around 2002 I think. Experimental studies of racially biased help-giving using unobtrusive measures. This was actually fairly early on this was something that my colleagues and social psychology were doing very actively in the 1970s and this type of research in which people who aren’t aware that they are participants in research but are given an opportunity to help such as by a black person dropping some papers and pencils in front of them just to see whether they will pick them up. Ah, often minor help, but not always sometimes it was some one who had fallen down in a subway and looked in need of some attention. These studies generally in characteristically showed that whites were more willing to help whites than they were to help blacks. The first one of these was studying “I still love” 1971 by Sam Gardner(ph) and Len Bitman(ph) in which the researchers who had identifiable white or black voices called into residencies in Brooklyn, New York, which was so sharply segregated that they could know whether they were calling an African-American or a white just by the street address they were calling to and the person in the African-American or white voice said that he was trying to call, ah Jose Garaz(ph) and he had broken down on the highway needed some help and when he discovered he hadn’t contacted Jose Garaz(ph). He said “I’ve used my last coin in the payphone this was the year before the cell phones. Probably I can’t do that experiment anymore… ah, here is the number would you call it for me and very clearly that white, whites were recalled who got this request for help were more ready to help white callers than black callers. Police profiling. Almost every study of profiling that has been done not all ah, localities, states, cities do these studies, but almost any set of data that has been looked into shows ah… discrimination in profiling that African-Americans particularly but also Hispanics were stopped more often. Employment discrimination and this is in part the audit studies, but I’m also talking about major law suits that have been settled recently in, in which major awards against major corporation have been or made damages have been made in cases of discrimination. This is particularly against African-American and to a lesser extent Hispanics. The 2008 election as we all know ah, that’s the election that indicated that America was post racial, turns out that Barack Obama would have lost in a huge landslide if he had to depend on the white vote. He got I think 43% of the white vote and the other racial groups he got more than two-thirds of well approximately two-thirds of Hispanics and little under two-thirds of Asians and 95% of blacks. So, the race was huge factor in this election and there are other indications including analysis of survey data and I did study administering race IAT the two days before 2008 election showing that IAT race discrimination scores, race preference course predicted vote, not hugely, but enough to make a difference. Research using implicit measures. One… some of which I just mentioned. This is where I’m heading and the word implicit probably one-year of familiar with but it was one that didn’t really exist in cognitive and social psychology until about the mid 80s and I did research in psyche info looking for the word implicit, but and I wasn’t looking for it anywhere because obviously implicit is a word in the language and has a lots of other meanings other than it’s particular meaning in connection with cognition, so I looked just in journals that were in social cognitive and I think developmental, no socio-cognitive or experimental in their titles. Excuse me. Peer review journals and just the word implicit as the key word meaning picked out as a search term so the numbers would be much huger and these were by five-year period starting 1960 going to the present, so you will see in mid 80s the word takes off and becomes huge in some ways implicit overlaps in meaning with unconscious. The word implicit probably came into the wide use because in around 1980, the word unconscious was pretty much taboo in psychology, some looking around the audience I can see that there are some of you hear who are old enough to know this as well as I do ah, one just did not use that word. It was a word that was owned either only in psychoanalytic domain, not in social cognitive and experimental or worse not, not that the cycle in analytic is bad and I know there is connection between the psychoanalytic group in this meeting. So, I, I’ve got to be very careful here in what I say, but there was a worse context, which was the, I was very much aware of, which was all the promotion and advertisement of supplemental self help, which had absolutely no scientific foundations. So that was another right domain for the use of the word unconscious and its use in those domains was part of what was keeping the word disrespectable in social cognitive experimental fields. But even that word has had some what of renaissance, which I’m glad to see and I am one knows whose willing to use it, time for the Implicit Association Test, ah, I’m for this group, I’ve to pick carefully, because I want it to pick a form of implicit bias that every one here could enjoy and age bias is an excellent one. Race bias would not work at all in this group, because of the racial diversity and in this audience that makes a real difference in responses to the race IAT and I wanted to because of the way the demonstration works, I really want something in which almost everyone in the audience is on the same wavelength. 

00:22:05
An IAT measure implicit age bias it uses four categories of stimuli young old pleasant unpleasant good agree nice friend truth bad vomit ugly horrible wrong 

00:22:10
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Four categories of stimuli are used young, old, pleasant, and unpleasant and young is represented by theses faces. You see them a littler larger than this on the screen, but these are faces that are morphed and I’ve got ears chopped off and foreheads chopped off and cut it at the help to get rid of facial expression, but they’ve got enough features, so you can tell that those people are younger than these people. I hope that will be easy to see and it’s they’re morphed, so it’s actually even hard to tell whether you’re looking at a male or female face. Some, some of these are more male, but female and some are female and male. Five pleasant words that are easily recognized as pleasant in meaning, five unpleasant words that are easily recognizable as unpleasant in meaning. Okay, we’re close to starting. I’m, I’m going to need you to speak loudly because I’m going to be in a way measuring your reaction times. And instead of pressing keys on a computer, which is the way the IATs administered most of the time, ah, I want you to say left and right that has a replacement for pressing a left and right key. I really want full participation if I specially need to hear those of you who are going relatively slow and/or having difficulty, ah so loudness. If someone sitting next to you is you can’t hear them, please just, you know give them a gentle elbow or, or something. I want you to try to respond rapidly saying left and right, but will start with just practice in which the speed is not so important. I will tell you when were I’m really interested in keeping track of the speed and there will be errors, don’t bother trying to correct errors. This is the when you do the IAT on the computer and keyboard, you do correct your errors, but for this demonstration, you make an error just be proud of it. Don’t, don’t change it and just keep, just look for the next stimulus. 

00:24:35
The Implicit Association Test (IAT)is intellectual property of Project Implicit, therefore just 10 seconds clips of group demonstration of the IAT have been shown from this presentation. Please go to https://implicit.harvard.edu to learn more about IAT. 

00:24:35
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD What I’m going to be doing is I’ll start with you. I’ll say, the first few responses, but then I’m gonnna drop out my responses just to press the keys when I hear the medium person in the room, responding. I’m just gonna try to get the central tendency for the room and press the key then. Okay, we starting by saying left for old and these are the faces and right for young. I will start with you. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:15
Left, left, left, left… left, right, right, right, right, right, left, right, right… 

00:25:30
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Okay, this is randomized you know five in a row, this, this gonna happen on the computer to. Now the pleasant and unpleasant words again just left and right. 

00:25:45
Right, right, left, left, right, left, right, right, left, left, right, left… 

00:25:55
Demonstration of age attitude IAT at this point (Audience ‘median’ latency displayed automatic preference for young…magnitude > 300 ms per item) Some explanation How does the IAT work? Fairly simply - when two concepts are associated, we can easily make the same response to examples of both. What does it measure? It measures relative association strengths some of these correspond to preferences; some correspond to stereotypes Does it mean that I dislike the elderly? No - It measures relative association strengths You may like both young and old Think of an IAT of own children vs, neighbors’ children 

00:26:00
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Ah, you may not be able to see the time, but this is giving me feedback of our, this is the median response time of my pressing the key. So we are on the order of 800 milliseconds. So, I’m, I’m actually not going to bother to do it again. You’ll, you want, you’ll get a little faster than this. It will be around 800 milliseconds, which was the same speed you did either of these tasks along and it was about 350 or so ms longer, which is in the kind of research I do. This is actually in eternity. Ah, one of my colleagues first time he tried the IATs said "That this is an effect that you can measure with the sundial", which I thought was a nice complement. Talk a little bit now about the science of the IAT, what’s going on with it. How does it work? Whereas a fairly simple statement. When two concepts are associated in our heads we can easily make the same response to examples of both. So the fact that you can respond easily by giving the same response saying left to young faces and pleasant meaning words suggests that they’re associated and perhaps bad and old are associated but in any case, they are more associated than the other combinations young and unpleasant, bad and pleasant. So this is presumably, I mean this is a very informal statement of the way in which the IAT picks up association strength. What does it measure. Well, measures relative association strengths. Our task is easier when the you got stronger associations for the with the two that are mapped to the same response then when one of those and one mapped to the other response is, is stronger in association. Some of the associations correspond to preferences that’s the case fore the age one, some correspond to stereotypes. I’m not gonna to try to demonstrate a stereotype, but the one of the most used stereotype IATs is once involving association of male and female with either carrier or with science and those are strong stereotypes that get picked up and interestingly they are actually slightly stronger among woman than among men and very deviant from self-report responses to questions measuring those stereotypes, they are, what… what deviant is the IAT measure. So, question that’s natural to ask in regard to the age IAT that we just looked at. Does this mean that you dislike elderly people? And the answer to that question is no or at least it is not necessary because this provides a measure of relative association strengths. You might like both young and old, but just like young more than old and that would produce the pattern that we demonstrated in, I’d would say among the majority people in this room. And you can think of an IAT I actually don’t have this IAT in which you’re judging pictures of your own children and pictures of the neighbors children are probably even your nieces or nephews possibly. And you’re doing this kind of task, you would come out associating pleasant warm with your own children than with the neighbors' children or your nieces and nephews and with I mean, I haven’t, as I haven’t done the IAT, but anyone who wants to make a sizable bet with me [00:30:00on this I will program it and we will carry out the bet. 

00:30:05
What is learned from the IAT What does it reveal about implicit biases? They are surprisingly widespread They are surprisingly widespread IAT measures predict discriminatory behavior 

00:30:05
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD What is learned from the IAT? What does it reveal about implicit biases? Well first thing is that they are surprisingly widespread. Here is the age IAT and this is for us about 350,000 respondents who took that test on the web, and 80 percent of them show a result that is characterized as some degree of preference for young and slight, moderate or strong and notice that strong is represented more than slight or moderate so this is not a mild preference, its...it a large effect as IAT effects go in fact one of the largest, people who score in the middle they have been, they are one way or the other in terms of the numbers but the numbers are too small and that too make it reasonable to classify them, as showing preference one way or the other, but 80% is an indication of pervasiveness and here is another indication of pervasiveness which is indeed the grey bars are IAT measures these are standardized scores meaning if you know Cohen's effect size, 0.8 is a strong effect so that I mark that there, 0.2 is a slight effect, so and the darker bars are self report measures in which youth, those subjects respond to a thermometer item, how warm will you feel towards young and old and so, we are looking at standardized measure of the difference between thermometer ratings of young and old and you see and these are age groups going from teenagers up to the highest age group we have but the most of our respondents are in these age ranges so there is just one group here, that is 47 and up, but here is the interesting thing, this is the IAT measure, it does not change with the age, elderly people show this just as much as do younger people which is why I knew, I didn't have to know the age break down you know in this room, to know that this test was likely to work well, and you see the this is what you might call it association the oldest group shows… says they are equally warm towards young and old and you see that steadily changing with age, even while the IAT measure does not, but what you see is the IAT measure is much stronger in magnitude showing this relative preference for young and it doesn't look like the self report measures at all. This is typical of IAT data in domains having to do with stereotypes, and prejudices the low correlations between self report and IAT and often different patterns in relations to third variables. The third variable here being age, some other IAT's this is the race one, this is almost three quarters of a million respondents probably this IAT has been taken by more than two million people who may 12 or so years its been available on the web and 70% overall showed relative preference for white is still strong result in very pervasive affect, but not as strong as the one for age. Here I had mentioned stereotype, here is the gender career one, this one is over 75% showing associating male more with career than female with career and as I said this is that number is actually slightly higher for women respondents than for men respondents. I am showing you now one result in which IAT data differs sharply by race, the other IAT's I have shown you are pretty much the same for male and female for white, black, Hispanic, Asian, by other ethnicity and religion. Excuse me. But this one is different. So about 80% of white respondents show preference for white relative to black, black respondents its 40% actually I didn't prepare this graph, I would make the, this red little category a little wider and so these numbers would be just a little smaller, so its actually close to a third each in black for showing automatic preference for white, and automatic preference for black, or a preference that's not distinguishable from equal. And this is other race categories, which are much closer to the white pattern, so that's includes Asian and Hispanic, okay. Surprisingly, widespread, this is something I haven't been saying until quite recently because, I didn't know, I didn't think that I had the right to, understood the theory that would connect implicit measures to behavior well enough to say that I knew that the IAT was going to predict discriminatory behavior but within the first 10 years or so, after the IAT was available enough research was done by a wide group of people so that it was possible to do a meta analysis, and that meta analysis was published about a year and year and a half ago and it includes aggregate effect size measures in and these are effects representing correlations of IAT measures with some behavioral criterion, and the darker bars are correlations for self-report measures and there are nine categories here, I am going to just breeze through this, three of them, one is white black race, other inter group things, Hispanic etc., gender and sexual orientations so all of these involve either stereotypes or biases and what is interesting about them is that the affect size is showing prediction of behavior are actually stronger for implicit measures in the race area and other inter group relations, gender sexual orientation, there is not significantly different but are about equal strength, if you look at most other domains with the exception of alcohol use, which is down here and the difference is not great in most domains such as consumer preferences and political preferences, self-report is predicting criterion measures better than the IAT. The other thing we learn from the meta-analysis is that both self-report and IAT have independent predictive value which means when you use them both in the same analysis, you’ll find it both are significant predictors controlling for the other and in those discrimination domains the independent prediction by the implicit measures is greater than that by the explicit measures and in most other domains it's the self report or explicit measures that show that greater prediction but all, in all of these the independent prediction however good quality incremental validity of the IAT measures was evident. And this, this was a collection of about 180 data sets that were included in this meta-analysis, it is in JPSB in 2009. 

00:38:00
They work well with real-world samples 42 real-world studies 

00:38:05
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD The IAT measure works well with real-world samples, some of the earliest criticisms of the IAT were the (inaudible ), you know sort of hard house(ph) technique doesn't work in the real world. 42 real-world samples, and this is available on my webpage, I have put up pointer to my webpage in medical, so the health care, employment, some very interesting results there in education, in the courts, someone in Italy is actually trying to use the IAT as a lie detector. I am not sure if its a use that I approve of, but the evidence, there is some evidence there I don't know it is good enough evidence to be used as a an individual person level measure and interpersonal relationships.

CONTROVERSY What's Wrong with the Implicit Association Test? Society of Experimental Social Psychology Spokane Washington October 19, 2001 Anthony G. Greenwald, University of Washington 6 measurement problems 4 conceptual problems available at http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/ 

00:39:00
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Some controversy so in 2001, someone had the (inaudible ) to give at the meeting of the society of experimental social psychology presentation title, what's wrong with the implicit association test? I am a proud, I am proud to say that was me. I was looking for things wrong with it and I, they were six measurement problems I could point to and four conceptual problems. Two and a half years later I gave an update, update of this top ten list. 

00:39:35
Revised Top Ten List of Things Wrong with the IAT Anthony G. Greenwald, University of Washington Attitudes Preconference SPSP - Austin, Texas January 29, 2004 available at http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/ 

00:39:35
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD And somethings I am glad to say had disappeared, and added a few things also. I just jumped to the bottom line of this, I wanted to give you my take on what the remaining challenging questions about the IAT are. 

00:39:50
Remaining challenging questions about the IAT • What are the contaminants of IAT measures? • What, in detail, is the process that produces the "IAT effect"? • How to describe what the IAT measures to people unhappy with their IAT result? • Is the IAT's measure of relative preference the same thing as prejudice? (No – it's a measure of relative preference)

ANTHONY G. GREENWALD No psychological measure is a pure measure of anything, so certainly the IAT has some contaminants, the speculation has been that something like cognitive flexibility or executive function enables people to do the task better and they may get smaller IAT scores but the IAT may not reflect their implicit preferences or stereotypes as well as for people who are, are relatively deficient in executive function or cognitive flexibility, interestingly although that's a very plausible hypothesis, there is actually not good evidence for yet, for it yet, some people tried to test that. What in detail, is the process that produces the "IAT effect"? You remember I gave you that very informal description if two things were associated it is easier to give the same response to them, well we actually don't have anything better than that to say it does, this is not a theory that will satisfy any cognitive psychology, it's not a theory that satisfies me, so the IAT rests on empirical evidence, ah... that it is measuring association strengths and the predictive validity meta-analysis is an important part of that, but we actually don't know the mental process is that are at... any kind of micro level producing the behavior of that you and I and others will show what were responding to the IAT. Ah... here is the actually... hmm... probably still the most challenging question and this connects to the use of the IAT in training, people who get the result saying they have stronger preference for white, automatic preference for white relative to black or they have a strong association of women... of men with science not women of men with career, not women, they may not like that result, and so using the IAT with them has the potential to backfire if they know that these are not beliefs that they hold, these are not what we'd called explicit beliefs, but the IAT picks this up. This is a challenge and I... I think it is a challenge that really needs to be addressed and which I am trying to address, and here is a related question. Is the IAT's measure of relative preference the same thing as a measure of prejudice? And I have always said no, because by prejudice we mean open, dislike and discrimination against an out group and the IAT is not measuring that, of course we don't know exactly what it is that the IAT is measuring that, but there was never I think a good reason to believe that what the IAT was measuring was the same as prejudice and remember it is a measure of relative preference. Ah... you are not, I wouldn't want to say that your prejudice against your neighbor's children, but the IAT would show that you have an implicit preference for your own children, relative to your neighbor's children. So this leads into what I can say about how the work on implicit bias is supporting a change understanding of how much of discrimination occurs. 

00:43:35
Concepts of implicit bias support a changed understanding of how much discrimination occurs • We like some people more than others • In particular, those who are similar to us (ingroup preference) • We are most helpful to those we like • Is there anything wrong with ingroup favoritism? • It gives advantages to those we like • This is OK (legal) in some situations • It's not OK (illegal) in other situations 

00:43:35
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Let's assume that we like some people more than others, that's probably true of all of us, in particular we like those who are similar to us. One of the strongest effects ever demonstrated by experimental social psychologists was demonstrated in the 1960s by Donn Byrne called similarity attraction effect, and almost any aspect of similarity works, you kinda like someone who is similar to you more than someone who is dissimilar to you. In general this is what we can call an ingroup preference, a very powerful phenomenon. And we are most helpful to people, those people we like, those people we like are people you know are likely to be people in our ingroup, this is the similarity attraction effect, its ingroup favoritism. So, is there anything wrong with our like... differentially liking people and giving more help to those we like than those we dislike, well certainly it gives them advantages but this is okay, it's legal, there is nothing wrong with it in some situations and you you’re not expect to pay for your neighbor's kids college education, you are going to do that more likely for your kids. Ah... We will hope that they get a scholarship, but it is not okay in all settings and it is the passage of the civil rights acts of the 1960’s that has made it very clearly illegal to exercise this kind of selective helping of ingroup members, that had show this kind of favoritism, ah... in other situations, especially in employment but not only employment, so this may be perhaps the best way I can try to communicate this and you this... I went through a mental exercise myself which I’m going to show you the results of it and you could do it yourself, you can add this list, that I produce. 

00:45:40
Some examples • Medical care optimum care for friends and family • Industry recommending school classmates for vacant management positions 

00:45:45
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD So in medical care ah... physicians are like to... likely to recommend optimum care for friends and family and by optimum care, I mean something that usually goes beyond what is covered by insurance, but of course if the physician recommends it, it will be covered by insurance, so I think this is the way in which many health care disparities are produced, its just the physicians are through one social process or another are led to recommend more, more exceptional superior expensive treatment for some than others and that's likely to be ah... you know, could be the neighbors kids that would… they would get that. In industry, ah... you are an executive, you’re ah... there is a job opening management you think of who do I know, who it can qualify that, I will recommend those people, okay, the other people may not even hear about the job, you are doing something that benefits an ingroup member, and you may go do more than that, you may actually see that... see to it, that you are company writes the advertisement in a way, so that your friend is the only one who actually qualifies for the job which is beyond the call and ingroup favoritism and ah... it’s hard to pick you know, when this is happening in isolated cases here and there, so its hard to pick this up in any way that could lead to a civil rights case. In education, ah... you have probably oh... you maybe most of you had enough experience to know that this occasionally happens, you know someone who is available for a job opening, you have got, you know, there used to be job openings ah... until last few years anyway, ah... but it... this will come back and you will have the opportunity to write a job description that fits the person you would like to take the job, legacy admissions to private universities are supposed to be a thing of the past. But how you may know that you know, that last month the chronicle on higher education published an article doctoral dissertation by someone named Herwitz (ph), "I think its at Harvard, showing that in fact private universities are very nicely engaging in legacy biases meaning children of (inaudible ) in admissions. In government, I suppose the lobbyists were giving you a lot of money are your ingroup buddies you might do favors for them in law enforcement, profiling, prosecutorial discretion. This is not the important things about these two are that they are not necessarily and may be, I am certain not most often cases of doing something, going out of your way to be hostile, to an out-group member, profiling, involving stopping people for speeding, well we all know that most people who speed don't get stopped at all. Ah... so the policeman are doing favors all the time of not stopping me when I am going just like everyone else, and I (inaudible ) out here ten miles over the speed limit, I know that the criterion is more like 15 and or 20 ah... but this is a favor they are letting law violators get away, well if they let some law violators get away more than others they are not doing anything, they are not going out of their way to be negative to law... ah... to the an out group, but they are as the profile and data show more likely to do it, ah... for whites, than for blacks or Hispanics, and the same with prosecutorial digression, which is a huge thing in the court, prosecutor, like when the defendant is ah... from a good family, a connected family and I don't need (inaudible ) ah... but may be that too, ah... the choice of charge on which to indite, it can make a huge difference in the outcome, okay. So trying to end now, and we have a little time for questions, here is the reconceived American dilemma. 

00:50:15
The American dilemma reconceived Statement of the reconceived dilemma A conflict between society-level description Civil rights law ingroup favoritism person-level description Egalitarian (non-discriminating) self-concept Unrecognized implicit preferences 

00:50:15
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD It is a conflict and this is, this first statement as a society level statement like Myrdal its between civil rights law which tells us what we should be doing legally, not to be non-discriminatory and in-group favoritism which is a force that I think tends to produce what the lawyers call desperate treatment leading a form of discriminations that’s recognized by the courts, and this is a re-conception because I am now stating what's happening not as you know, in...in... Mrydal’s case, it was poor treatment of American Negroes and he was talking about lynching ah... and... and other really nasty things those are happening much less, but I think the in-group favoritism is still very much alive. Now here is the way of stating if that is at the person level, it is I have my self concept as being egalitarian meaning I internalize the American ideal of all created equal, but I have these unrecognized implicit preferences for example many of you may not have been aware that you have an implicit preference favoring young over old, ah... but the IAT, can show you, that you do have it, and some one aspect of this reconceived dilemma is that if these are indeed unrecognized, well... is it really a conflict, is it a conflict, I... I think of myself as egalitarian, I don' know that I have these forces in me that might produce non-egalitarian behavior, in a way half of this dilemma is underground, its hidden, its unconscious, ah... its not... its not necessarily an active psychic, intra-psychic conflict, so just I will finish this up quickly and I think we will have some time for discussion. 

00:52:30
Applying the implicit revolution to diversity goals • Is cognitive retraining to eliminate implicit ingroup preferences a solution? - Probably not • Can the IAT's be used in diversity training? • Yes - to demonstrate the psychological basis for in-group preference - to explain how it can operate unintentionally to motivate efforts to avoid illegal in-group favoritism • What methods can disrupt ingroup favoritism? 

00:52:30
ANTHONY G. GREENWALD Is cognitive training to eliminate implicit ingroup biases or preferences a solution. I... It was nice to think that that might be the case, but I think the answer of that is probably not. I think that these preferences we have are strongly enough engrained, packed when we get past childhood, so that we are not easily going to develop interventions that will undo them, and one of the... actually have an empirical basis first that probably not answered, its because I think in the more than decade, decade that the IAT has been around, if people who were trying to retrain cognitive biases as measured by the IAT had succeeded in developing a successful intervention, we would have heard about it, the only things we have heard about are things that work very short time and produce what I consider elastic changes in implicit biases meaning you can huh... and I have done some of these experiments myself but the simplest one is one IAT, the race IAT's administered by a pleasant attractive black experimenter you got a reduction in the race IAT, but what happens a week later, a month later well we don't know, and why don't we know? Well, it could be that no one has done research on this, but I actually think that we don't know this because people who have tried to do it, found that it actually doesn't happen, that it doesn't last that long. Can the IAT's be used in diversity training? Well as, I just said, I wouldn't use it to try to retrain biases and use this as the measure of successful retraining biases because I am not really optimistic about that as the path to go, but I do think it has, has uses in diversity training, in particular, the way we used it here to develop the idea, that there are basis for ingroup preference of which we may be unaware and to explain how this can act on us unintentionally to produce behavior that we may not even recognize as having this potential to produce unequal treatment, give you a simple example, and this one applies to me and may apply to some of you also, occasionally I have been asked by a relative or friend to write a letter of recommendation to college for their child or other relative who we don't know ah... and I have said okay, I can... I would... tell me something about them I'll write a letter, and now I realize that this is just one of these forms of ingroup favoritism that has the tendency to produce desperate treatment. Last question I am going to ask is what methods can disrupt ingroup favoritism, so for going into company trying to tell them how do get rid of that tendencies to give higher performance evaluations to races or promotions to ingroup members, unfortunately, I don't have time to answer that question. This is it, so that question what methods can disrupt in-group favoritism. I am being treating it humorously, but it is not at all humorous, it is a really important question and I am not answering it only because there is not a one size fits all answer, that is not a one strategy for all situations in fact this is a question that has to be attacked in terms of the practices in the organization, if it is a company, if it is a school, if it is a hospital and we are talking about health care, so this is where people who are doing the work of diversity training or trying to help companies solve diversity problems really need to look into the organizations and see what it is that can be done to deal with the practices of that organization to disrupt things that may be producing unintended ingroup favoritism, okay, so I am that's where I am ending. Ah.... if you want to find this website its got a easy address implicit.harvard.edu, that's where you can take ah... that... I think 14 IAT's and if you want to take them in some language other than English, I think this is the smaller number of there are now thirty some odd countries that have in and about 17 or so foreign languages in which you can take the IAT, press this button that say demonstration, if you press this one you will be reverted into research that you may not be ready for, but you can just, you can just back out of that.
