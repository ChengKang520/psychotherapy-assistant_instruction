00:00:00
DANIE BEAULIEU  Yes. 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Well, they were -- I was picked. 

00:00:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Ah, you were picked? So you can just sit down nearby, maybe there if you want, or -- and, uh, yeah. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN  The person down here has the time for you to stop. 

00:00:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN We're giving you ten minutes, then five minutes, on a piece of paper. 

00:00:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN So you know how -- 

00:00:15
DANIE BEAULIEU So, welcome to all of you to this, um, presentation. My name is Danie Beaulieu, and I'm a psychologist from Quebec. Um, and I have two areas of specialties, one being eye-movement integration therapy; that was developed by Connierae and Steve Andreas, and I also have a specialty in impact therapy, which will be the purpose of today. Um, so it's going to be a live demonstration on how impact therapy has been influenced by Ericksonian hypnosis, and how different it is. I think the best way to introduce it is to tell you a story that was told to me by Dr. Rubin Battino. He told me that, uh, one day a client comes to Dr. Erickson, and, uh, Dr. Erickson being very intuitive, he feels like this client seems like have -- to have the weight of the world over his shoulders. So rather than talking to the client, he just turned around -- he turned around and, next to him -- you know, he was in his wheelchair -- next to him on the shelf was a big bowling ball. You know the big heavy ones? And then he doesn't announce or say anything. He just turned around and tried to grasp the bowling ball. It's hard, and it seems to be an awful lot of pain to -- and he goes, 'God'. Tried to help the client. Dr. Erickson makes, you know, a sign 'No, no, it's okay.' And it takes -- it took him a lot of time to finally bring the damn bowling ball on his thighs. The minute it had been on his thighs, whoa, he threw it as a flash to the client, who was so surprised, of course, because he didn't expect it. He was expecting a big heavy weight coming at him, but it was a fake. It was a balloon. 

00:02:25
DANIE BEAULIEU And so the client was, 'It's a balloon.' So Dr. Erickson said, 'It seems like things are not always as heavy as they look, right?' Do you think is hypnosis? I think so, for sure. And this is the definition we use, or the type of practice we do, in impact therapy. First of all, Dr. Erickson put the problem outside of the client. As long as it's inside, it's hard to touch, it's hard to define, it's -- and the client feels he's not -- doesn't have any power over -- 'It's inside of me. I can't control it. It comes up, it's' -- you know, now he pulls it out, he brings it outside of the client. And he uses something extremely simple which, uh, allows, um, elicitation of resources, that is, now the client knows, 'Oh, it's just a bowling ball. I can control it. It's just a balloon. I can control it.' The message is in the experience. So in impact therapy we use some -- we want to talk to the body, we want to talk to the eyes. This is our way to reach the unconscious material. Any kind of experience, any kind of tools, of props, can become a ticket to enter the unconscious. So therefore what I want to demonstrate today, because I have only one hour, rather than doing just one session, I really -- with one person, I really wanted to offer two, three, four different demonstrations on how you can use different tools, just like the bowling ball, except, as I come from Canada, I didn't care to borrow -- to bring along a bowling ball. But I brought different props with me. And I'm going to do a demonstration of, um, how these props allow the body to start to talk. So we start listening with our eyes. And I will develop the -- there are three phases, really. I will do just like what we do in hypnosis. First we introduce a trance. I will introduce an experience. Second, we work the unconscious ingredients, seeding, some spices in it. I will -- you will see me doing that as well. And there's the closing, where we will have a post-hypnotic induction, which in this case in impact therapy is very simple, because as we rely on something very concrete, very simple, we know the person, the client, will see this prop again and it will serve as a reminder of -- a conscious and unconscious reminder, of what has been worked during the session. I will be demonstrating tomorrow morning, actually I will be offering a workshop, where people can experience it for themselves both as a client and as a therapist. But today I will be doing two, three, four demonstrations, uh, depending on the amount of time I will have. Suits you? I picked some very simple, um, impact experiences so that it will be easy for you to bring them back home if you want to, introduce them in your practice. Could I ask the first volunteer to come up? Thank you. I think they need to wire you. Right? Hello. 

00:06:20
DONELLE Hi, there. 

00:06:20
DANIE BEAULIEU What's your name? 

00:06:20
DONELLE Donelle. 

00:06:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Donelle. Okay, if you'd please sit down, Donelle. 

00:06:30
[sil.] 

00:06:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Oh, thank you. 

00:06:40
[sil.] 

00:06:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, Donelle. First, thank you for coming up. 

00:06:50
DONELLE You're welcome. 

00:06:50
DANIE BEAULIEU You don't know what's going to happen, right? 

00:06:50
DONELLE I do not know. 

00:06:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, I'm glad that you're open to experience some impact experience here. Do you like reading? 

00:07:00
DONELLE I do. 

00:07:00
DANIE BEAULIEU You do. Could you please hold this book? 

00:07:05
DONELLE Sure. 

00:07:05
DANIE BEAULIEU And let's imagine this book is the book of your life. Could you please open it up to a page where you think you're at now in your life? Take all your time. Don't think too much about it. Just let your body guide you. Where do you think you're at, at your life right now? 

00:07:30
DONELLE I think I'm not quite two-thirds through my life. 

00:07:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:07:35
DONELLE Um, probably right around that. Um, this is the past, and this would be the future. 

00:07:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Good. Are you, um -- what do you feel when you ex -- when you hold this book in your hand? Anything particular? 

00:07:50
DONELLE No, I noticed I thought I'd go further back, and then I knew I wanted to come -- there's more than I thought left. 

00:08:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:08:00
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:08:00
DANIE BEAULIEU If you would have to, uh, look at this part here, the past part -- 

00:08:05
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:08:05
DANIE BEAULIEU -- um, is it a good story? Is it difficult? Is it easy? Is it, uh -- 

00:08:15
DONELLE A lot of variety. 

00:08:15
DANIE BEAULIEU A lot of variety? 

00:08:15
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:08:20
DANIE BEAULIEU How about the last pages just before, you know -- 

00:08:20
DONELLE Just before here? 

00:08:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. 

00:08:20
DONELLE This part? Um, more peaceful. 

00:08:25
DANIE BEAULIEU  More peaceful? 

00:08:30
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:08:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you think some of these pages of the past will -- will still talk about it in the other pages coming up? 

00:08:40
DONELLE Sometimes. 

00:08:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Sometimes? 

00:08:40
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:08:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you think it will influence the next pages? 

00:08:50
DONELLE Yes. 

00:08:50
DANIE BEAULIEU It will? 

00:08:50
DONELLE Some, definitely. 

00:08:50
DANIE BEAULIEU  Would you be interested perhaps in finishing a chapter -- would it be appealing you to finish a chapter today and start a whole new section? Is that appealing to you, or you'd rather just continue the same story? 

00:09:15
DONELLE I think that would be appealing. 

00:09:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Appealing? 

00:09:15
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:09:15
DANIE BEAULIEU So let's get wild. 

00:09:20
DONELLE Okay. 

00:09:20
DANIE BEAULIEU What would you like to put in this new section? 

00:09:20
DONELLE The new section. Um, more positivity. 

00:09:25
DANIE BEAULIEU More positivity? 

00:09:30
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:09:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Is that in every sphere of your life? 

00:09:30
DONELLE Hmm, in my work. 

00:09:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? In your work? 

00:09:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you think that would make it a better book? 

00:09:40
DONELLE Yes. 

00:09:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Is it already written like the other pages? Is it already written, or do you think you will write them, you will create them? 

00:09:50
DONELLE Um, a little bit of -- it's maybe, like, got a little outline, but I'll be writing a lot of it. 

00:10:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:10:00
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:10:00
DANIE BEAULIEU What would be the best part of the first pages that, you know, even if we are starting a whole new chapter -- 

00:10:10
DONELLE The very -- 

00:10:10
DANIE BEAULIEU -- that you would like to keep in the future pages? 

00:10:10
DONELLE The very first part would be the humor in my -- of the early childhood. 

00:10:15
DANIE BEAULIEU That you would like to keep? 

00:10:15
DONELLE I'd like to keep that. Um, probably college and then since I've been married. 

00:10:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Hmm, lucky girl. 

00:10:30
DANIE BEAULIEU That's a whole new other demonstration and workshop, so let's not get into this. That has to do with my own book, okay? So -- 

00:10:40
DANIE BEAULIEU -- therefore -- who is the writer of this book? Who is the main author of this book? 

00:10:50
DONELLE Myself. 

00:10:50
DANIE BEAULIEU  Yourself? Was it true for the first part? 

00:10:55
DONELLE Oh, for that part? No. 

00:10:55
DANIE BEAULIEU It was more like a collaborative work? 

00:11:00
DONELLE Um-hum. Definitely. 

00:11:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Yeah? Since when have you started writing your own book? Which chapter? 

00:11:10
DONELLE Hmm, right probably about here -- 

00:11:10
DANIE BEAULIEU About then? 

00:11:10
DONELLE -- going to college. 

00:11:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Wow. 

00:11:15
DONELLE Yeah, like, starting writing more my own book. 

00:11:15
DANIE BEAULIEU (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
DONELLE I left home, left the city where I grew up. 

00:11:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Do you want to make, um, the next, uh, section looking -- like, what would be a -- a theme? What would be -- would it be like, uh, a drama? Would it be like a three x's movie? Would it be like -- 

00:11:40
DONELLE Maybe a comedy with some adventure. 

00:11:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Add some adventure? 

00:11:40
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:11:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Could I ask you something? Could you close your eyes? Now that you're holding your book, the last -- there's the whole last part, this whole part here that -- 

00:12:00
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:12:00
DANIE BEAULIEU -- is there for you to create. How does it, uh, feel inside when you, uh, -- you tell yourself 'I want to add some excitement, adventure in the last part. And it's going to be a very different section from the first part of my book'? Do you feel any sensations, any pictures coming up, any emotions when you, um, try to get this idea inside of you that the last part of the book will be a lot more adventurous? Anything comes up? 

00:12:45
DONELLE I also want to be more humorous. So -- 

00:12:45
DANIE BEAULIEU More humorous? 

00:12:45
DONELLE -- with that -- with that adventure. So kind of a freeing through here of thinking, 'Yeah, you know, it doesn't have to be so practical all the time. 

00:13:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. That's good. And you feel, in your body, at peace with it? 

00:13:05
DONELLE A little bit of -- kind of a cross between excitement and a little bit of anxiousness. 

00:13:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Let me keep your eyes closed. 

00:13:15
DONELLE Okay. 

00:13:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Or you can open them up, actually. Look up here. 

00:13:20
DONELLE Okay. 

00:13:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Let's say I take this big part of the book -- 

00:13:25
DONELLE Okay. 

00:13:25
DANIE BEAULIEU -- and I say this part here has been filled with the adventure you wanted to add, the humor, and it's now on this part. So I want you to go up in time up to there -- up to here. How is that? Let's say it really happened, it really happened. This part, this chunk here -- 

00:13:55
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:13:55
DANIE BEAULIEU -- has been filled with adventure, humor, and you did it, you really did, and that was really this part here. How is that? Is it comfortable? Or do you regret this last part? 

00:14:15
DONELLE No, it makes me feel like I'm ready for retirement. 

00:14:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Way -- makes you feel like you're ready for retirement? 

00:14:20
DONELLE Yeah, after filling that part. 

00:14:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. Are you happy, satisfied, though, of this last part? Do you feel you've missed something? Do you feel it's -- 

00:14:40
DONELLE No, I try to live authentically, so I feel good about that. 

00:14:45
DANIE BEAULIEU You feel good about that? 

00:14:45
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:14:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Are there still this part coming up? 

00:14:50
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:14:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you want a continuity, or do you want again to make a wild change, a third -- open up a whole new third section? 

00:15:05
DONELLE I think most if it can tend to have continuity, but there'll be some new things. 

00:15:15
DANIE BEAULIEU There'll be some new things? 

00:15:15
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:15:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Can you share them, or you don't know yet about them? 

00:15:20
DONELLE Um, I see that as being involved with travel. 

00:15:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Involved with travel? 

00:15:25
DONELLE Yes. Traveling more. 

00:15:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, Donelle, I want to ask a new question now. 

00:15:35
DONELLE Okay. 

00:15:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Is there a place in this book where there's, um -- I think in English you say "wont"? "Wound"? "Wand"? 

00:15:45
DONELLE Desire? 

00:15:45
DANIE BEAULIEU No, no. 

00:15:45
DONELLE Oh. 

00:15:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Hurt. 

00:15:50
DONELLE Oh. 

00:15:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Wound? Wand? 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Wound. 

00:15:50
DONELLE A wound. 

00:15:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Wound. Wound. Of course. Wound. 

00:15:55
DONELLE Wound. 

00:15:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Whatever. Okay, you know what I mean. So is there a place -- 

00:16:00
DONELLE Thank you. 

00:16:00
DANIE BEAULIEU -- in there where there's a wound? 

00:16:05
DONELLE In the past? 

00:16:05
DANIE BEAULIEU In the lesson after this. Pardon? 

00:16:10
DONELLE In the past or the future? Or what just happened? 

00:16:10
DANIE BEAULIEU I was thinking in the past. Please, yeah, play with the sheet. 

00:16:20
DONELLE Yeah, I mean, would it be -- oh, there's a lot of ones too. 

00:16:20
DANIE BEAULIEU There's a lot? 

00:16:20
DONELLE Right through there, yes. 

00:16:25
DANIE BEAULIEU If you let your body -- your body guide you, and you can play with them or you -- with the sheets, or you can just get to the right place or feel you are already at the right place, could you point to the most hurtful wound? 

00:16:45
DONELLE  Yeah, it's right there. 

00:16:50
DANIE BEAULIEU How do you feel when you open this up? 

00:16:55
DONELLE Saddened. 

00:17:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Saddened? 

00:17:00
DONELLE Feels like a weight's pressing down on me. Feel kind of cheerful. 

00:17:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Hmm. Any pictures for you inside of your -- 

00:17:10
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:17:10
DANIE BEAULIEU -- in -- yeah? 

00:17:10
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:17:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Would you like to share them? 

00:17:15
DONELLE Hmm. Um, my mother had a schizophrenic break when I was 14, a psychotic break, became schizophrenic. 

00:17:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Your mother is schizophrenic? 

00:17:25
DONELLE Yes. It happened when I was 14, so that'd be right through there. 

00:17:35
DANIE BEAULIEU If you would have to identify big words in this page, what would they be? 

00:17:45
DONELLE Abandonment. 

00:17:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Abandonment? 

00:17:50
DONELLE Uh, frightened. 

00:17:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Frightened. 

00:17:55
DONELLE Overwhelmed. 

00:17:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Overwhelmed. Is it something that has been worked on in the other pages of the book? 

00:18:05
DONELLE Yes. 

00:18:05
DONELLE It has? For instance, if we get to this page here, is there still some trace of the wound, or is it completely gone? 

00:18:20
DONELLE A little trace, but not much. 

00:18:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Not much. Donelle, because I want to demonstrate other things too, I would close here. But first of all I'd like to check with you. 

00:18:35
DONELLE Um-hum. 

00:18:35
DANIE BEAULIEU  What do you take from this session? 

00:18:40
DONELLE I liked looking back and seeing how much there'd been growth. I liked the idea of realizing I could change some new things and create some things and then still have a retirement ahead of me. 

00:18:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Any -- 

00:18:55
DONELLE I liked having the physical -- 

00:18:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:18:55
DONELLE -- aspects of actually seeing it. 

00:19:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Any questions? Any other comments you'd like to share? 

00:19:05
DONELLE  No. I liked looking up here and realizing what we just looked at here is so far back here. 

00:19:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Well, the good news is, as you like to read, I'm sure you will hold many other books, and each one will remind you of how you can create your future. 

00:19:30
DONELLE Thank you. 

00:19:30
DANIE BEAULIEU You're welcome. 

00:19:35
[sil.] 

00:19:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Nice hair; much better than mine, I'm sure. Thank you, Donelle. 

00:19:45
DANIE BEAULIEU So just -- that's just a little simple experience you can -- you know, for clients, as I said in the previous panel, clients who are very resistant to come to you, their resistance comes, uh, from, uh, the fact that their focus is on you and they're afraid to be judged and stuff. In doing something as simple as this, you're changing the focus. The focus is no longer on me; it's on the book. And automatically they become -- it's a new experience you're creating. And then of course you start questions on the book. How can you resist a question on the book? You're not talking about themselves. You're talking about a book. So, um, let me demonstrate something else. Could I have a second volunteer coming up on stage, please? You signed already the stuff? Who signed -- yeah, yeah, come in, please. Sorry, I -- I -- we already have three persons who signed -- yeah, three. 

00:21:00
NANCY I didn't really volunteer. I was picked. But I'm happy to be here. 

00:21:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Are you? 

00:21:05
NANCY I think. 

00:21:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. 

00:21:05
NANCY (crosstalk) right, but -- 

00:21:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. Okay, okay. What's your name? 

00:21:05
NANCY Nancy. 

00:21:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Nancy. That's easy. Okay, Nancy. If you could please sit. What am I going to pick now? 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Hello, Nancy. How are you? 

00:21:50
NANCY A little frightened. 

00:21:50
DANIE BEAULIEU A little frightened? 

00:21:50
NANCY Not used to this. 

00:21:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Not used to this. 

00:21:55
NANCY I'm not. 

00:21:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Me neither. So -- so that makes two of us. 

00:22:00
NANCY All right, thank you. 

00:22:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Where are you from, Nancy? 

00:22:00
NANCY Connecticut. 

00:22:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Connecticut. 

00:22:05
NANCY Um-hum. 

00:22:05
DANIE BEAULIEU I like that. 

00:22:05
NANCY Um-hum. 

00:22:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you see the drop in here? 

00:22:10
NANCY The drop? 

00:22:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. Do you see a drop of water? 

00:22:10
NANCY Yes. 

00:22:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Um, good. That's what I want you to say. This bowl here, how many drops of water do you think there is in this bowl? Like, tiny drops of water, tiny drops of water. How many drops of water do think there are in this bowl? Very tiny ones. 

00:22:35
NANCY I want to say infinity, but it's not quite that much. 

00:22:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, you know, well, that's smart. 

00:22:35
NANCY That's an easy one. 

00:22:40
DANIE BEAULIEU It's smart. Let's say billions. 

00:22:40
NANCY Oh, hundred thousand. 

00:22:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, or -- 

00:22:40
NANCY Hundred million. 

00:22:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. Let's say billions. 

00:22:45
NANCY Billions? 

00:22:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. 

00:22:45
NANCY Okay. All right. 

00:22:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Now, I want you to imagine, like, if I put this little drop in here, what's it going to do? Not much, right? 

00:23:05
NANCY No. 

00:23:05
DANIE BEAULIEU If I would put a drop of urine, pee-pee -- 

00:23:15
NANCY Yes. 

00:23:15
DANIE BEAULIEU It's a very serious demonstration here, as you know. If I would put a drop of pee-pee in here, would you be willing to take a bit of. uh, just a drink in this? 

00:23:25
NANCY Uh, depends. Maybe way out on the other side. 

00:23:30
DANIE BEAULIEU You would? You would? Because I could have pee-pee here. I mean, I can -- are you serious? If I put the drop here, you're willing to drink here? 

00:23:40
NANCY Well, with a bribe perhaps. 

00:23:40
DANIE BEAULIEU With what? 

00:23:40
NANCY A bribe. 

00:23:40
DANIE BEAULIEU A bribe? Woo. 

00:23:45
NANCY It might cost you. 

00:23:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Ooh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. 

00:23:50
NANCY I mean, I don't want to be too compliant here. 

00:23:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, yeah. You're doing a great job. 

00:23:55
NANCY Try not to be too resistant. 

00:23:55
DANIE BEAULIEU  Well, just do as you think, Nancy -- 

00:24:00
NANCY Okay. 

00:24:00
DANIE BEAULIEU -- okay? What I want to come -- the point where I want to come is, let's say that each of these drops of water represent each of the people on this planet. 

00:24:15
NANCY Each of the people on this planet? 

00:24:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, all the human beings -- 

00:24:20
NANCY Okay. 

00:24:20
DANIE BEAULIEU -- on the planet. 

00:24:20
NANCY All right. 

00:24:20
DANIE BEAULIEU This is your drop. 

00:24:25
NANCY A drop in the bucket. 

00:24:25
DANIE BEAULIEU  What do you think you're adding to the pot? 

00:24:30
NANCY  Hmm. 

00:24:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Is it like the pee-pee or is it like the water? Is it like coffee or is it like -- I mean, just in terms of type. Because you agreed to tell that just a single drop affects -- 

00:24:50
NANCY Um-hum. 

00:24:50
DANIE BEAULIEU -- all the billions of drops of water in there. And therefore our own drop, when we add it to the pot, it does affect all the drops. So I would like you to just reflect on what is the drop you're adding to the pot. Are you satisfied with the contribution right now at this point of your life that you're adding to the pot? 

00:25:30
NANCY Well, what I'm thinking of is -- is it would be such a very small tiny addition. But I would hope that in the work that I've done in my past, there would be some bit of significance that would raise the -- the level. 

00:25:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. Would you think of your drop as something clear? Something dark? Something vibrating? Something hot? Something warm? Something cold? 

00:25:55
NANCY I was thinking of, like, a diamond. 

00:25:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Like a diamond? Um-hum. 

00:26:00
NANCY I actually like diamonds, so -- 

00:26:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, yeah. Do you think it's been -- like, do you feel, do you see that it has been changing throughout the years, the drop you've been adding to the pot? Right now you see it as diamond -- 

00:26:20
NANCY Yeah, I think so. 

00:26:20
DANIE BEAULIEU -- which is very nice. 

00:26:20
NANCY A bit, yes. 

00:26:25
DANIE BEAULIEU And, um, can you think, for instance, of maybe, like, ten years ago or 20 years ago? I'm sorry, you're 19, right? So -- 19 years ago. So could you -- could you think of, um, ten, 20 years ago, what kind of drop you were adding to the pot? 

00:26:45
NANCY That's when I was 50. I can't remember the -- um, right, it's been a long time. Um, that -- that's about a good -- maybe a couple of drops. 

00:27:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Are you satisfied with your actual contribution? Or if you would have the chance, would you change it? 

00:27:10
NANCY  Well, there's always room for growth. I mean, I've been coming to these conferences since '84, and each time I come I learn more -- new things and I go back with more things to work with. So there's lots more that I could -- would like to -- 

00:27:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:27:30
NANCY -- add to the pot -- or to the bowl. That's right, it was a pee-pee, so I have to -- 

00:27:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. Nancy, when -- I'm just asking some weird questions here. When you add your drop to the bowl, how do you feel in the bowl? Let's say your drop is in it right now; you're part of this big family universe. Do you feel you're connected with others, or do you feel you're disconnected with others? 

00:28:00
NANCY I -- I feel that I'm part of it, but I'm so curious about all the other parts, or all the other people on the planet, or -- 

00:28:10
DANIE BEAULIEU All the other drops? 

00:28:10
NANCY Yeah. I'm very curious. 

00:28:15
DANIE BEAULIEU So if you would have to imagine yourself in -- as one of the drops inside, you would picture yourself like going around the pot? 

00:28:25
NANCY Oh, yeah. I'd be exploring or swimming around and -- 

00:28:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:28:25
NANCY -- trying to absorb learnings from others and other -- 

00:28:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:28:30
NANCY -- experiences and -- 

00:28:35
DANIE BEAULIEU And that's comfortable for you? 

00:28:35
NANCY -- learning from it. Yeah, very much so. 

00:28:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:28:35
NANCY Yeah. 

00:28:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you feel you've been quite a bit around, or are there some places you still haven't explored? 

00:28:40
NANCY Oh, boy. Maybe half -- halfway around. 

00:28:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. 

00:28:55
NANCY There's a whole other half to yet explore. So I hope I live long enough to explore that. 

00:28:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. Um-hum. Um, as a result of just seeing yourself as a drop and being part of this whole experience of life, what is your inner experience right now? What's your -- what's inside of you? 

00:29:20
NANCY Um, mostly curiosity. This is interesting. Um, maybe a little confused, I'm not sure about things, but certainly open to -- 

00:29:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. 

00:29:35
NANCY -- uh, new experience, new learning. 

00:29:35
DANIE BEAULIEU It is, um, always very interesting and confusing to see that we're so alike with other people. You know, we're all drops of, uh, of water in a way. And so of course it's a little confusing. 

00:29:50
NANCY Yeah. 

00:29:50
DANIE BEAULIEU  But I am sure that inside of you, because most of us are made out of 70% of water, so there'll be a way to circulate it around yourself, around your body, and it will find a comfortable way. 

00:30:10
NANCY Well, I love to snorkel, so I'm imagining myself -- 

00:30:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Oh, yes. 

00:30:15
NANCY -- snorkeling in the other half. 

00:30:15
DANIE BEAULIEU There'll be a lot more of exploration. 

00:30:15
NANCY Yeah-huh. 

00:30:15
DANIE BEAULIEU  Anything you'd like to share with us before we finish? 

00:30:20
NANCY  I -- I would like to learn from the other half. I'm -- 

00:30:25
DANIE BEAULIEU The other half? What do you mean? 

00:30:30
NANCY The other half of what I don't know. I'm assuming that -- 

00:30:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. 

00:30:30
NANCY -- I've learned a lot in my life, but there's a lot yet to learn. So I'm -- I'm wanting to learn more -- 

00:30:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, so that experience -- 

00:30:40
NANCY -- experience more. 

00:30:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, that's the kind of -- would you say it's the output or the out -- the -- the outcome of seeing it like this that you say 'Oh, there's a part I haven't explored and that I want to explore'? 

00:30:50
NANCY Um-hum. 

00:30:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Is that what it -- 

00:30:55
NANCY Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:30:55
DANIE BEAULIEU -- arises for you? 

00:30:55
NANCY Yeah. 

00:30:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Good. 

00:30:55
NANCY Definitely. 

00:30:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Anything else that you take home with you following this experience? 

00:31:00
NANCY Well, I'll read your book. 

00:31:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Marketing will come later. Okay, so -- 

00:31:10
NANCY I'll buy it. 

00:31:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. Thank you very much. 

00:31:10
NANCY Thank you. 

00:31:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Thank you for attending. 

00:31:15
NANCY Thank you very much. 

00:31:15
DANIE BEAULIEU I hope this was -- 

00:31:15
NANCY Okay. 

00:31:15
DANIE BEAULIEU --has somehow -- shaking some of the water inside of you. Thank you, Nancy. 

00:31:25
DANIE BEAULIEU  Well, I think I have time for another one. Somebody come -- come up? A man. Did I say I wanted a man, or -- no, that's fine. 

00:31:40
DAVID BLACKBURN You didn't know I was drafted. 

00:31:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Hello. 

00:31:40
DAVID I'm David Blackburn. 

00:31:40
DANIE BEAULIEU David Blackburn. Welcome, David. Thank you for volunteering. Okay, David. Where are you from, David? 

00:31:55
DAVID BLACKBURN From Salado, Texas. 

00:31:55
DANIE BEAULIEU I think we don't -- oh, I think -- wait, we need to wait for her to open your mic. Okay, where are you from? 

00:32:05
DAVID BLACKBURN I'm from Salado, Texas. 

00:32:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Oh. Okay. Very nice. You're willing to -- 

00:32:10
DAVID BLACKBURN Sure. 

00:32:10
DANIE BEAULIEU -- share a different experience? Okay. 

00:32:10
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:32:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Let's do it with something that everybody has in his or her office. Let's use a simple piece of paper. 

00:32:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Okay. 

00:32:20
DANIE BEAULIEU  Let's say this piece of paper, David, represents everything you can be, your whole essence. Some people, they are -- they have no problem showing fully who they are. Last night I was having dinner with Sharabell Gasby and got very interested by a concept she talks about, which is a devalued part of ourselves; so, some parts that we tend to hide, that we don't want people to see and that we don't -- we have not developed, how we're trying to hide, ending up with something more like this. 

00:33:15
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:33:15
DANIE BEAULIEU So, being less. If I say this sheet represents all you can be, are there some parts -- if you play with it and you start, like, just exploring around this sheet, are there parts of it that you're not showing or you feel that they have been devalued or they're kind of hidden -- hiding? 

00:33:50
DAVID BLACKBURN Maybe some of the parts. 

00:33:55
DANIE BEAULIEU That part there? 

00:33:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:33:55
DANIE BEAULIEU  Any other parts? 

00:34:00
DAVID BLACKBURN  Maybe some over here. 

00:34:05
DANIE BEAULIEU  Something there as well? It can also be parts that you haven't had, uh, the chance or, yeah, to develop, and therefore they -- you're not accessing them, you do not -- we don't see them, you don't see them, they're not exposed in your life. Is it -- do you feel it's the case for you? 

00:34:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Yeah, there's some parts that -- 

00:34:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Where are they? 

00:34:40
DAVID BLACKBURN They would probably be up here. Probably a little bit bigger. 

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:50
DANIE BEAULIEU  Everything in the center and the rest of the page is fine? 

00:34:55
DAVID BLACKBURN I think so. 

00:34:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. As you have sculpt -- uh, sculpted this, um, sheet, does that make you feel anything, any -- does that arise any kind -- 

00:35:10
DAVID BLACKBURN Rounded. 

00:35:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Rounded? 

00:35:15
DAVID BLACKBURN Yeah. 

00:35:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Any other words for this? 

00:35:15
DAVID BLACKBURN  Systematic. That's what I was thinking of -- 

00:35:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:35:20
DAVID BLACKBURN -- since I did the corners. 

00:35:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:35:25
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:35:25
DANIE BEAULIEU What does it say about you? 

00:35:25
DAVID BLACKBURN That I'm systematic and logical. 

00:35:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Do you like that -- 

00:35:30
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:35:30
DANIE BEAULIEU -- of yourself? 

00:35:35
DAVID BLACKBURN I -- I do. 

00:35:35
DANIE BEAULIEU You do? 

00:35:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Makes sense to me. 

00:35:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Do -- the first part down there, down below there -- 

00:35:45
DAVID BLACKBURN Down here? 

00:35:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. -- has it been folded like that for a while? 

00:35:50
DAVID BLACKBURN  Yeah, I think so. 

00:35:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:35:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:35:55
DANIE BEAULIEU  Um, can you point to a specific time of your life? 

00:36:00
DAVID BLACKBURN  Probably a loss when I was younger. My dad died. So it's been a while. 

00:36:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. Any emotions associated to that? 

00:36:15
DAVID BLACKBURN  Sad. 

00:36:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Sad? 

00:36:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:36:20
DANIE BEAULIEU  How about the other part of the sheet, down below the other side? Has it been there for a while? 

00:36:30
DAVID BLACKBURN Not as long. 

00:36:30
DANIE BEAULIEU No? 

00:36:30
DAVID BLACKBURN No. 

00:36:30
DANIE BEAULIEU  Can you identify anything in particular? 

00:36:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Hurt would be here. Um-hum. 

00:36:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Hurt? 

00:36:40
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:36:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Are you comfortable expressing related to what? 

00:36:45
DAVID BLACKBURN This was a divorce. 

00:36:45
DANIE BEAULIEU A divorce? 

00:36:45
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:50
DANIE BEAULIEU  Has it grown, these two parts? Have they grown since the problem occurred, like the death of your father and the divorce? Has it stayed the same, or has it moved in the past years? 

00:37:05
DAVID BLACKBURN I think, in the -- in the -- it -- it grew, and then it's gotten a lot less in the -- over the years. 

00:37:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. But right now this is where they are? 

00:37:15
DAVID BLACKBURN This is where they are, um-hum. 

00:37:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Can you identify something specific to the other parts up there? 

00:37:25
DAVID BLACKBURN These would be areas that I haven't explored or haven't, as you'd mentioned, accessed -- 

00:37:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. 

00:37:30
DAVID BLACKBURN -- things that I'd like to do in the future. 

00:37:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you have any, um, views of, uh, what they could be, in which field, which area? 

00:37:45
DAVID BLACKBURN Writing. 

00:37:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Writing? 

00:37:45
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:37:50
DANIE BEAULIEU And how about this other part? 

00:37:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Retiring. 

00:37:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Retiring? 

00:38:00
DAVID BLACKBURN Eventually. 

00:38:00
DANIE BEAULIEU So, retiring will help you become more of yourself? 

00:38:05
DAVID BLACKBURN It seems like it would be more complete, instead of constantly working. 

00:38:10
DANIE BEAULIEU  Okay, so you could have, uh, time for other dimensions -- 

00:38:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:38:20
DANIE BEAULIEU -- of your life? 

00:38:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. Other areas of growth. 

00:38:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. Can I ask you something? 

00:38:25
DAVID BLACKBURN Sure. 

00:38:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Would you be comfortable if I would hold your sheet? Thank you. So when I look at this, it seems like, uh, there's still a large part of you that is there, that is -- 

00:38:45
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:38:45
DANIE BEAULIEU -- um, living fully, um, you know, experiencing life and part of your life. Right? 

00:38:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:38:55
DANIE BEAULIEU  So what -- how would you feel if I'd say this little part here -- what would be different if it would become this much instead of what it was before? 

00:39:15
DAVID BLACKBURN Then that would open up other areas in my life. 

00:39:20
DANIE BEAULIEU It opens up other areas? 

00:39:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:39:25
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? Does it make you feel anything particular when you, uh, have access to this new part that we've lowered or-- 

00:39:35
DAVID BLACKBURN A bit less sad. 

00:39:35
DANIE BEAULIEU A bit less sad? 

00:39:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:39:35
DANIE BEAULIEU  When you look at this and when you feel this, do you feel your body is ready for this, your whole human being -- your whole being is ready for this? Or does it say 'No, it's not possible. Come on, put it back where it was?' Or does it say 'Ooh, that feels comfortable?' 

00:40:00
DAVID BLACKBURN It -- it seems like it's more acceptable. 

00:40:05
DANIE BEAULIEU It's okay? 

00:40:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. 

00:40:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Could be okay? 

00:40:05
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:40:05
DANIE BEAULIEU How about if I open it completely? How is that? 

00:40:20
[sil.] 

00:40:20
DANIE BEAULIEU No? 

00:40:20
DAVID BLACKBURN No. 

00:40:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Let's put it back to where it was. Would you like to share what just happened? 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Still sadness. 

00:40:35
DANIE BEAULIEU It -- I had a lot of burst of sadness. Right? 

00:40:45
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:40:50
DANIE BEAULIEU So like this -- 

00:40:50
DAVID BLACKBURN It seemed more sad when you opened it. 

00:40:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. 

00:40:50
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you think if we open it after some sadness has gone, then it will be comfort and fully open and fully free? Or if you open it again, the sadness will remain? 

00:41:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Maybe eventually it would be free. 

00:41:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Say that again? 

00:41:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Maybe eventually -- 

00:41:25
DANIE BEAULIEU It would -- 

00:41:25
DAVID BLACKBURN -- it would be free. 

00:41:25
DANIE BEAULIEU -- pass? 

00:41:25
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:41:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. So for now, is it okay if we leave it like this -- 

00:41:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Fine. 

00:41:35
DANIE BEAULIEU --which is already some improvement? 

00:41:40
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:41:40
DANIE BEAULIEU  Are you okay if we address this part here? 

00:41:45
DAVID BLACKBURN Sure. 

00:41:45
DANIE BEAULIEU  I wonder what's under there. You have any idea? Can't see. 

00:42:00
DAVID BLACKBURN The hurt. 

00:42:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Some hurt? 

00:42:05
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:42:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Depriving you from having access to the full being of who you are? 

00:42:10
DAVID BLACKBURN  It would interfere. 

00:42:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Pardon? 

00:42:15
DAVID BLACKBURN It would interfere, um-hum. 

00:42:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Let's try again to make it just a little bit smaller. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:35
DANIE BEAULIEU What happens? 

00:42:40
DAVID BLACKBURN That's okay. 

00:42:45
DANIE BEAULIEU It's okay? Do you feel any kind of, um, opening inside of you, or more freedom or more lightness or more -- 

00:42:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Little bit more lightness. 

00:42:55
DANIE BEAULIEU A little bit more lightness? 

00:42:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:42:55
DANIE BEAULIEU  If you go through the feelings you have and sensations you have right now, do you feel, um, it would be okay for you -- for you to be like this and to accept this improvement? 

00:43:15
DAVID BLACKBURN It would be a change, but it's -- it's okay. 

00:43:20
DANIE BEAULIEU What is it that, uh, we would, uh, see differently when I'll see David and I say 'Oh, he's like this here and like this here'? 

00:43:30
DAVID BLACKBURN Probably less hurt and less sad. 

00:43:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah? 

00:43:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:43:35
DANIE BEAULIEU That's good. 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Can we do a little bit more? 

00:43:45
DAVID BLACKBURN  Well, don't open it up. I mean, you might open it up a little bit. 

00:43:55
DANIE BEAULIEU I'm sorry? 

00:43:55
DAVID BLACKBURN No, I was saying, if you open it up, I'm -- I don't know. 

00:44:00
DANIE BEAULIEU  Let's try. So this is David and the divorce, and now it's not taking so much part in him anymore. How is this? 

00:44:25
DAVID BLACKBURN It's okay. 

00:44:25
DANIE BEAULIEU It's also okay? 

00:44:25
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:44:30
DANIE BEAULIEU What's this new part adding to your life? If this is really the new David, and this thing about his divorce is now to this point, what's different? 

00:44:50
DAVID BLACKBURN Less weight. 

00:44:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Less weight? 

00:44:50
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:44:50
DANIE BEAULIEU You feel it in your body? 

00:44:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Is there something around pride or, like -- that may not be the case, but I'm just asking. Like, showing more of yourself, utilizing more of yourself, experiencing, loving, being more of yourself, is that anything associated to it as, uh, changing the sheet? 

00:45:30
DAVID BLACKBURN  Probably being more willing to show more emotion rather than hiding it. 

00:45:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Um-hum. Do you like that? 

00:45:45
DAVID BLACKBURN To show more emotion? 

00:45:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. 

00:45:45
DAVID BLACKBURN  I do and I don't. 

00:45:50
DANIE BEAULIEU  Did you want to put it back where it was? 

00:45:55
DAVID BLACKBURN You can keep it there. 

00:45:55
DANIE BEAULIEU  I see you're a very gumptious man. Do you feel you're, uh -- you would be ready for some more in these areas up here? 

00:46:15
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:46:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Wait, I have a surprise for you, because this one's -- you know, this retired man thing, how many more years do you need to wait for this? 

00:46:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Oh, probably a long time. 

00:46:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Let's be wild. It's just a -- a role-play. 

00:46:55
[sil.] 

00:46:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Okay, tomorrow. 

00:47:05
DANIE BEAULIEU  Do you think, do you believe, do you feel this David, you would love him much more than the other one? 

00:47:20
DAVID BLACKBURN  Be much freer. 

00:47:25
[sil.] 

00:47:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Is it what you want to become? 

00:47:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:47:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Now, let's put it back to where it was. 

00:47:45
DAVID BLACKBURN It's probably more realistic. 

00:47:45
DANIE BEAULIEU  Now, I'm going to try to open this part to where I've put it just a minute ago. And I want you to stop me from doing it. Okay? 

00:48:05
DAVID BLACKBURN 'Kay. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:55
DANIE BEAULIEU You sure you want to do this? You don't have to follow all my orders, you know. 

00:49:00
DAVID BLACKBURN I know. 

00:49:00
DANIE BEAULIEU So that's what you want to do? 

00:49:05
DAVID BLACKBURN I'll probably keep it there. 

00:49:10
[sil.] 

00:49:15
DANIE BEAULIEU I'm sure somebody else is putting it down for you. 

00:49:20
DAVID BLACKBURN Hmm. 

00:49:20
DANIE BEAULIEU I don't think it's you doing this. Nobody wants to be less than what he can be. And the one who's holding onto this is pretty strong. 

00:49:35
DAVID BLACKBURN Um-hum. 

00:49:40
DANIE BEAULIEU I'm afraid I cannot stop him, but I'm sure you could. So it's going to be your fight. I hope you identify him, because I'm sure you could do much more with the whole sheet than the sheet without this part. Don't you think? 

00:50:10
DAVID BLACKBURN (nodding) 

00:50:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Waiting another 15 years before he says 'Okay, open it now.' I hope you find a key to enter this. I'm going to be very generous. I'll leave you the sheet. But your unconscious will be seeing a lot of sheets after this session, and they're all complete. And this is where your unconscious will lead you. So keep reading and keep writing. 

00:50:55
DAVID BLACKBURN Okay. 

00:51:00
DANIE BEAULIEU Thank you. 

00:51:00
DAVID BLACKBURN Thank you. 

00:51:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, come here. It's my treat. Thank you, David. 

00:51:10
DANIE BEAULIEU So we do not have so much time left, but what I want to, uh, do is take the opportunity to maybe explain some of these principles of what has been going on. The minute we put outside of the client his experience, what it says automatically to the client is 'Oh, I can affect it, I can see it.' You know, in diff -- we have people here from very different countries, speaking different languages. Um, I know five languages, and in every single one of them we use the -- the word "to see" to express really understanding. Like in English we say "I see what you mean." In French we say "Oh, je vois ce que tu veux dire. Y je sais, yeah." We use the verb "to see" to express really "to understand". And I think literally it's true. So if you find -- like, use anything. You use it. Like what I did, I used three simple impact experiences. But the minute the client sees it, the sheet is no longer a sheet; it is -- it has feelings to it, it has sensations attached to it. And if you touch it, then you start touching really something that usually is untouchable. You connect with the client. You create a relationship with the client that can vey very deep. The link with Dr. Erickson is also, uh, the fact that he used playfulness. Uh, one thing that Steve says, Steve Andreas, he says many people tend to be very stiff, very digital. You know, they arrive with a problem and they're very digital, stiff. Dr. Erickson said the goal of all psychotherapy is to add flexibility to the system. And, um, Steve calls it to become analog rather than digital. And, uh, here, as we are adding some playfulness, you play with a sheet, then you wake up the child part within the client, and the child is -- likes to play and he's very flexible. So, um, it's a good ingredient to add to the process, the therapeutic process. Therefore, you know, it's -- it's very, very simple to start seeding when we've brought the problem outside of the client. Seeding here, I just open up a little bit the sheet and a little bit more and 'How does that make you feel,' and it really creates a lot of sensations, a lot of emotions. But the client leaves, and what has entered through the occipital, the visual information, I think, as therapists, we have no idea of how much it affects people's decisions. But if you are -- if you ask marketers and politicians, they know all about it. They will talk to your eyes, not so much to your ears. And we have proof and studies of it. And us in therapy, we most often keep talking to the ears. So I like to leave all my clients with a picture, with an experience, so that the body and, as -- you know, I'm using very simple props that I know the client will be using as he's leaving, then the reminder will be there even if I don't see the client again. So that concludes the presentation. I hope I'll see you tomorrow morning, if you want to experience these for yourself. And I wish you a very good end of conference. Thank you.
