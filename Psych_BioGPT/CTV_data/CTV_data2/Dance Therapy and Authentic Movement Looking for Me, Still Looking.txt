BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
JANET ADLER My name is Janet Adler. I’m a dance therapist. At this point in my life, I’m deeply concerned with the body. I’m concerned with how we can become alive through movement and thus give a strong basis for a growing sense of self, a good self without so much conflict between body language and verbal language, between the intellect and the emotion. I’m concerned with the potential that people might have for accepting this integrated self for a self love. This acceptance I think, can relieve the sense of being a wholeness which can free a person to experience real communication with himself and with others. In the research project funded by the Maurice Falk Medical Fund, I’ve had a chance to really look at some of my ideas. While working intensively with both normal and disturbed children. Trying to understand if body movement as a medium of communication can be in fact an alternative to some of the more traditional method, because these children have let me into their worlds to share some moments with me. I now can share with you some of my experiences by means of film.

WITH JANET ADLER 

00:02:10
JANET ADLER These four year old children are choosing parts of themselves that they want to explore. By beginning with an experience with each part, one at the time, they are gradually moving into a richer consciousness of their bodies. The first awareness of self for every human being comes through the mother’s touch and through the close contact with her body. Thus, the first sense of self is the body sense; awakened by the mother’s care. This in turn encourages each child to explore his own body beginning an infancy and continuing as he grows. This growing consciousness of body awareness is so often crushed as the adult world makes increasing demands on the development of the intellect. The body must not get left behind as the phenomenon, separate and primitive. But, instead, we must insist that it remain a vital source of all aspects of growing. The awareness of the body’s parts and spaces can be intensified in an imaginary experience like body painting, (inaudible ) does not forget even the small quiet places. 

00:03:20
[sil.] 

00:03:40
JANET ADLER When moving across the floor, the children perhaps are less conscious of each separate body part. Their bodies flow as units with strong and safe tact of feedback from the floor. When they are upright in the space of the room, they move into the space, relying on the stronger kinesthetic sense of where they are. Some reaching up and now was more confidence than others. 

00:04:05
[sil.] 

00:04:20
JANET ADLER The children solo dancers are each a unique expression of what is meaningful to the child that particular moment of that particular day. Rhythm release, fantasy self-consciousness, all are part of his opportunity to take a risk and share this moment. 

00:04:40
[sil.] 

00:05:25
JANET ADLER Philip is a member of a five year old group in which the children have had more experience in movement. They are more able to express abstract emotions such as anger using the whole body and to enjoy a confidence in control and release. Eric’s happy dance speaks for itself. There is a magnificence sense of sharing with the group. Everyone has caught his dancing mood. 

00:05:50
[sil.] 

00:06:00
JANET ADLER I visited this preschool program twice a week for 30 minute sessions throughout the school year. The children always like to end the sessions with a roaring group goodbye which invariably let each child into his own spontaneous farewell. 

00:06:20
[sil.] 

00:06:25
JANET ADLER For some children, glowing can be a very painful and frustrating experience. These disturbed children find it extremely difficult to form relationships and 30 minute sessions twice a week, I tried through an emphasis on body movement to make their group experience more meaningful to make growing less painful. 

00:06:50
[sil.] 

00:07:25
JANET ADLER Sometimes, there really there were wonderful moments, when the children were really invested in the shared moments, so that a group feeling was possible. The complete circle of rope was extremely helpful, because the children seem to be less threatened by this neutral object than by holding each other’s hands. However, the children needed an enormous amount of individual attention far more than I was able to give them as a dance therapist coming in from the outside only twice a week. Each child had his own way of telling us, but he could not be part of the group. 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:20
JANET ADLER Since most children both normal and disturbed, spend their school day in a group situation. I’m naturally concern about how meaningful dance therapy can be as a group experience especially with very disturbed children. What I learned was that these children simply could not sustain their interest in the group for very long, despite my determined efforts. 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:08:50
JANET ADLER The children as they so often do created a game to meet some of their stronger needs. Through it they each experienced a chance to move out with direction into the enclosed space, assured of landing safely, a chance to reinforce to one to one relationship, they so badly needed with an adult. 

00:09:10
[sil.] 

00:09:15
JANET ADLER Two of the children were beginning to risk relating to each other. Perhaps, this beginning was strengthen by the use of the enclosed rope. But it was still very scary for Cynthia to work in this way, even though she felt she was ready to try it. 

00:09:30
[sil.] 

00:09:40
JANET ADLER Cindy tried to work with another child Libby(ph), who was even less ready to sustain a peer relationship. Libby(ph) seemed to still need constant support from an adult. Because children like Libby(ph) are more interested in self-stimulating or autistic behavior than they are and the people around them. The benefit that they might gain from the group experience could be limited. Libby(ph) is living in her own very private world in which she speaks her own private language, a language not necessarily made up of words. Since, no one else speaks this unique language, ordinary communication is difficult if not impossible especially in a group situation. Ideally, Libby need the one to one relationship in which a common language can be developed much like the special language between a mother and her infant. In the beginning, the mother relies solely on body communication in her relationship with her child. Therefore, when working with children like Libby, what I think is needed is a situation in which the body, the common denominator is the basis for a shared communication. This became so clear to me as I worked intensively on a one to one basis with several other children who like Libby, were living in private worlds. 

00:10:55
[sil.] 

00:11:15
JANET ADLER When I first met Amy and Deborah, two of the children I worked with individually, they were psychotic in the autistic stage of development. They like the young infant spent all of their times stimulating themselves. Their autistic gestures were ritualistic, highly stylized patterns of movement. Amy originally diagnosed as psychotic is now five years old. Deborah also diagnosed as psychotic is only two years old. When dance therapy was recommended by a psychiatrist, I began seeing each child to work three times a week in 30 minutes sessions. Neither child had ever experienced treatment of any kind nor had their parents. Neither Amy nor Deborah had verbal language. Neither child played with toys. Again like a new infant, neither child had ever experienced to relationship with another human being. Communication was then only possible in one way through our bodies. Since their tiny limited worlds were intensely physical, I tried to enter their worlds and speak their language by reflecting their movements. In the beginning, this was simply direct imitation. By doing what she was doing, I was trying to tell her that I liked her just the way she was without asking anything of her. I wanted her to know that she was safe to be completely herself. Then when she was ready, we could begin to share. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:50
JANET ADLER Space and distance were very meaningful aspects in our developing relationships. The room was large enough to allow sufficient space for the child to decide from moment to moment. What the boundaries of her critical distance would be. If I intruded and came too close, she told me by moving away and if I made the same mistake again, she let me know. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:55
JANET ADLER Usually the first strong affect to response was rejection, an indication that the child wasn’t best in some emotional energy and beginning to relate to me. 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:35
JANET ADLER The flat imitation began to fall away as the child permitted me to really move into her world, to share her feelings, though still on a body level. 

00:14:50
[sil.] 

00:15:20
JANET ADLER As the distance lessen between us, it became more and more difficult for each child to make the choice between physical contact and autistic isolation. 

00:15:30
[sil.] 

00:17:45
JANET ADLER I learned over and over that if I spoke their language, they responded. Each child within the safety of the room and situation had I think begun to trust me. Up to now, she had permitted touch, but not enough to relax and become passive like a baby. Both girls were now on the earlier stage of symbiosis and spent most of their time wanting to be held. Perhaps it was at this point that they had begun to experience themselves as one of two people in a relationship and could then begin to grow and go through some crucial faces of normal development, which they missed the first time around. It is important to understand that Amy and Deborah experienced these stages in a chaotic and scatter time sequence unlike the predictable path of a normal baby. These children then began to explore my body just as the normal child begins to explore the mother’s body. Deborah seriously investigated all parts of me. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:19:15
JANET ADLER Once the child established a deep awareness of me, as a substitute mother, she became interested in her own body as separate from mine. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:55
JANET ADLER Deborah now seemed to really be aware that we are two different people. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:10
JANET ADLER Both the children were finding it possible to choose mutuality over isolation, but not yet consistently, not yet in a predictable pattern. Because they could sometimes emotionally invest themselves in a relationship, even though I was asking more of them than I had before. There was now less need for imitation. Mutual trust did now exist at the body level. It was beginning to look like a normal relationship. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:21:25
JANET ADLER They were sometimes magnificent moments when our bodies were in a heighten(ph) synchrony. In these moments, we were saying something very important to each other. 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:40
JANET ADLER For both Deborah and Amy, this was just a beginning. But for the first time, they had each experienced a relationship with another human being. 

00:21:55
[sil.] 

00:22:10
JANET ADLER Whether as professionals or as parents, adults who are concerned with the development of a child are continually looking for more effective ways to help them grow. But, I think that in order for their help to be more meaningful, not only to the child but to themselves, they must feel comfortable with themselves with less conflict between their own body language and verbal language, between their intellect and their emotions. These adults were exploring space, a space around themselves which is really an extension of themselves and the space in the room which is really the beginning level of exploring each other. Their eyes were closed not only to lessen the feeling of self-consciousness, but also to remove visual stimuli so that they could really concentrate on the Kinesthetic and tactual aspects of these experiences. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:25
JANET ADLER A moment of non-verbal communication between two people can be a new and often very powerful experience. Self-awareness can be heightened when the movement flow between the partners is mutual and spontaneous. Ideally, no one leads, no one follows. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:24:30
JANET ADLER In an open intellectualized society, adults rarely have a chance to really let go to see where their buddies can take them. If these adults have reached a better understanding of themselves in relation to their own bodies, perhaps, their words and actions can be more honestly reflective of what they really mean. Perhaps then, there will be fewer difficulties in communicating with each other and with the children in their lives. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:20
JANET ADLER These five year old children already have confidence in their bodies. They can abandon themselves to the moment. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:26:30
JANET ADLER By experiencing this kind of freedom and release without fear, control and self-discipline now have real meaning. This is because they know what they are controlling and thus are not afraid of letting go. Some of these children can even give up their control to their partner as he pretends to be a sculpture manipulating their body. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:27:20
JANET ADLER After working with children in varying degrees of mental illness, I have learned that body language can be the first means of successful communication. Sometimes, it can also be the basis from which verbal communication can grow. But I have also learned that normal children too have very real problems in understanding themselves and in relating to others. If these children can become conscious of their bodies, it could mean that they are experiencing the first vital step toward a total integration of themselves. We cannot tell children what their needs are. We cannot tell them how to express themselves or how to listen. We can provide opportunities, in which they can be themselves, follow their internal rhythms and discover that their bodies can come alive through movement. Their bodies can then become a beautifully natural part of their speaking, of their listening, of their moving and growing through a time and space called childhood.

00:30:15
NARRATOR This is a film about authentic movement, a practice concerned with a relationship between moving and witnessing, an invitation to move closer to the self. People looking for clarity in their lives find this way of work useful as therapy, as resource for any creative process and a spiritual practice. 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:55
NARRATOR Though both men and women study this form, in this situation these eight women are joining me. Authentic movement offers a way of learning how to see and how to be seen as we are. Within this framework, this form assumes complete trust in the body’s capacity to remember and to tell the truth. With this dynamic at the center, in the past 20 years, a developmental process has become apparent. First, a person learns to allow self-directed movement in the presence of a witness. Next, the mover learns to witness another person move. Finally, people move and witness in a circle. Moving and witnessing takes us into and through personality toward an integration of body and spirit, toward wholeness. Now we begin. As I witness many people moving, I try to create a clear and safe container for the movers, though they take responsibility for their own physical safety by opening their eyes were necessary. 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:35
NARRATOR Eyes are closed to invite deeper listening. In the dark and silence, journeys begin with feelings, images, sounds, memories, thoughts and sensations, gates to the unconscious open as movers descend. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:34:05
NARRATOR As the witness, I have no directions for the movers. There is no way I can know what they must do. Not knowing what to do, Margaret’s only guidance comes from her body and it’s deepening impulses. In the beginning of this process, impulse finds form primarily in three ways. For Margaret, energy is expressed in specific body parts. 

00:34:40
[sil.] 

00:35:00
NARRATOR or Elizabeth, a gesture of gathering appears. 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:15
For Jean(ph), idiosyncratic movements emerge. Originating in the unconscious, they have been buried under the rational ordered body ego, then there initially appears irrational and unfamiliar that they feel right. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:40
NARRATOR As the work develops, personality differences become visible. Some people like Susan , follow emotions easily. Others like Margaret, often follow images. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:15
NARRATOR Bonny usually follows the kinesthetic sensations. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:30
NARRATOR Patterns emerge. There are expressions of unresolved aspects of personal development. For example, Bonny finds herself upside down over and over again. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:50
NARRATOR Another example, when Susan feels emotional, she often brings her hands to her neck. 

00:36:55
[sil.] 

00:37:15
NARRATOR Kate's pattern, she moves most truthfully when her head is covered. 

00:37:25
[sil.] 

00:37:45
My time is about (inaudible ) to be seen, and making my… making myself visible without going outside my… outside myself. 

00:37:55
NARRATOR After moving, we gather in a circle. Movers speak first. What had ones been unconscious becomes conscious. As people explore, sort through and try to describe where they have been. As the witness offers her experience in response, each mover can learn that she has been seen. 

00:38:20
I was so far away, I didn’t know, I just didn't think I was ever gonna be able to come back. Feeling so glad when you were there. You know people that knew that they didn’t know for sure to be a lot more... 

00:38:40
NARRATOR As people see themselves a little more clearly, personal consciousness evolves out of the collective unconscious. Kate like many who began in a group, chooses to work one to one in diet. Within our developing relationship, she explores patterns and her movement that increase their demand for attention. This phase of the work is often practice as therapy. 

00:39:15
[sil.] 

00:39:35
NARRATOR The mover inevitably struggles between surrender and will, between risk and safety, take sense of timing and appropriateness guide her in choosing either to follow the wisdom of her body or to honor her caution. 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:55
NARRATOR Focusing, bringing attention, listening more and more deeply, Kate learns to recognize the channel through which her creative energy moves. Each movement, no matter how small, becomes impeccably formed. Her obedience to this knowledge holds the transformative power of the work. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:35
NARRATOR Being seen by another helps us to see ourselves differently. One of the first experiences in life for the child is being seen by the parent. In authentic movement, the movers need to be seen, invites the complex task of trusting one’s witness and eventually of trusting oneself. 

00:42:00
[sil.] 

00:42:05
I just felt like (inaudible ) away and there was just movement and then that was it and then I kind of started calling I think and then I came up. And then I felt, all suddenly kind of (inaudible ). 

00:42:30
(crosstalk). 

00:42:35
And it was kind of scary. At one point, I didn’t know if you were here or not. I wanted to call. Yeah, when you did, it was very helpful. 

00:42:45
(inaudible ) very much. 

00:42:50
NARRATOR Usually within two to three years of being seen by a trusted witness, a mover internalizes this witness. As this new internal witness evolves, the movement begins to accept herself as she is and she is ready to witness another person move, a responsibility and a privilege. 

00:43:10
Looking around, feeling the space. 

00:43:15
[sil.] 

00:43:20
NARRATOR Back in the group, in this diet, Kate is learning to witness Margaret. As Kate tracks her inner experience, she is containing it rather than expressing it. Margaret’s energy, her shapes, her sounds, guide Kate’s reality. Witnessing, Kate opens to two realities at once, her own and her movers. 

00:43:55
[sil.] 

00:44:00
NARRATOR The triad is the next step in the evolution of this form, Kate and Bonny had been witnessing Susan. 

00:44:10
I remember making that (inaudible ) I remember doing this and feeling, I felt like a bird, I felt like it's a bird with that… and I had this chest (inaudible ). 

00:44:30
[sil.] 

00:44:35
At one point I remember going through her feet and I felt herself, I was coming out, coming out of this cave(ph) or something like I was coming out of the thing, and then I remember standing up and feeling my own legs in the same position and I felt like I would come out of her and then was taking my place somehow. 

00:45:00
NARRATOR Two witnesses with similar or different experiences expand the container for the mover. In another triad, Elizabeth and Lisa witness Margaret. 

00:45:10
And I felt an incredible amount of sadness, I felt really protective and (inaudible ) to be safe. I guess I felt really relieved that you didn’t rush herself. I felt relieving… I felt relieving in the beginning. And when you finally started moving, I mean you didn’t move much but I don’t know which is the pace, what’s right for me, the whole… the whole pace, the way everything went and for me there was a kind of a buildup so that when you are finally up like this, I think kind of emotion had been just welling up in me somehow. There was something really powerful about the sequence. So I just appreciated what you did, your movement. 

00:46:15
Then with an appreciation for the fineness of detail and what I was seen and how I was seen, what I was seen, how I was seen, I felt like very… 

00:46:30
NARRATOR This form teaches how to talk together. After the mover speaks, the witness speaks, only of her own experience, not of how she imagines her movers experience to be. The witness carefully chooses what to share and what to contain by owning her projections, judgments and interpretations, she may experience compassion and clarity. 

00:46:55
When you were talking, I felt like I was listening to you talk about you and you, I felt like I was listening to you talk about you and felt like I listen very carefully (inaudible ) myself most fine. 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:20
NARRATOR As personal consciousness develops, each person one by one like Kate comes through this process toward collective consciousness, toward ritual. Now we form the long circle. Eight people collectively carry and strengthen the container for Lisa as she moves in the center. In the long circle, people move alone or with others as they wish whenever the time feels right, and they witness whenever they wish, focusing on any mover or all movers. Louisburg moves in the center and then returns to replace in the circle and becomes a witness again. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:30
NARRATOR As we move from not knowing to knowing, from chaos to clarity, from the unconscious to consciousness, all patterns and forms dissolve as new energy is free to emerge. 

00:48:50
[sil.] 

00:53:25
NARRATOR Embodiment of our own truth brings us to a clear place in the presence of each other. 

00:53:35
[sil.] 

00:56:00
JANET ADLER Kate sees me see her, seen herself, the emergence of the internal witness makes the external witness less necessary it is timely and essential for the witness to move again.

EMI Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources Playing: Pretending Spontaneous Drama with Children 

00:58:15
NARRATOR Playing, pretending, spontaneous drama with children. Playing, creating, it's as natural as it can be. No kids often play out things they're wondering about. It's their way of trying to understand what has happened or what could happen, like doctor play. Most kids have been poked and looked down and examined and may be even hurt by the doctor. So it feels good to turn it around and be the doctor and do all those things to someone else being active instead of passive. Creating from past experiences and feelings, they project part of themselves into what they make. 

00:59:15
Hello friend. 

00:59:15
Hello darling. 

00:59:15
You are a bird, aren’t you? I’m a bird too. 

00:59:20
I'm a boy. 

00:59:20
I'm a girl. 

00:59:25
NARRATOR Sometimes it's even easier to talk about feelings with puppets. Like feelings of affection as Shirley and Fay are doing. Kids have a lot of stories to play out too. Sometimes they're funny stories. Like when Dana(ph) pretended to be a statue for sale in the store, and Ralph began to argue about the price. Well, it was so funny that even Dana(ph) had a hard time to keep from laughing. 

00:59:55
RALPH So, it'd be $348. 

00:59:55
$348. 

01:00:00
RALPH Look at this, (inaudible ). It really should be… Look at there, buttons missing. Please… I wanna… I wanna to have it. 

01:00:10
(inaudible ). May be not possible. 

01:00:12
RALPH Well, look at this! Let's go! 

01:00:20
I had a dream and it was so scary that it woke me up. While I was sleeping I heard a noise and it was like someone breaking glass. So, I woke up and then I saw a man and he had a big long knife and then he saw me and he broke the window and he came to pull… 

01:00:35
NARRATOR Now, playing our dreams can be scary, but if kids talk about it when it's over, it helps to know that other people have scary dreams too, and that dreams aren't for real, but they come from feelings inside, and that it helps to talk about it. 

01:00:55
Wayne Cook Drama Therapist 

01:00:55
NARRATOR Of course, it takes a special kind of grownup to play with kids this way. A grownup who can really listen, a grownup who remembers what it's like to be young. To have all those thoughts, and ideas and feelings and stories inside, just waiting for a time and a place to be expressed.

01:01:55
[sil.] 

01:02:00
NARRATOR Two hours a week for two years a group of adolescents came to the outpatient clinic of Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center to be part of an expressive therapy group. Each had a different problem. Each had a different label, but all were hurting. To meet their different needs, we made available a wide range of flexible materials which could be used in a variety of ways. We hoped that through the use of many different creative modalities, these adolescents might come to find, to know and to master what one member called; "That Green Creature Within." The Expressive Media made available included art, drama, poetry, music and dance as well as photography. Super eight movies and slides taken by the group members themselves were used to help these adolescents look at what was going on and to develop not just artistic but psychic perspective. 

01:03:10
Take it easy, take it easy Don't let the sound of your own wheels Drive you crazy We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again. So open up… 

01:03:25
NARRATOR Taking directly about sensitive issues was often painful. For some like Mathew it was easier to say things through poetry or in writing. Some of the artwork was almost painfully elegant, such as Cindy's two agonized faces made after witnessing an especially traumatic event. Marlene, herself an abandoned child had recently had an abortion. For months she created, nursed and destroyed a series of symbolic babies. Only then could she talk openly about the experience and her own feelings of loss. A leader in a group of this kind must be flexible enough to play many different roles. Most of the time observing, listening and responding empathically. 

01:04:15

NARRATOR There are times however, but it may be teaching skills or helping a group member with a task, like helping Sherry make her paper mache sculpture. There were leaders who were willing to look, listen, play, teach, take roles and to help in anyway that might be needed. And most of all, there was a sense of fun, of joy, of playfulness, which made it possible for members to react to each other in a natural way. 

01:04:45
Ellie Irwin Drama Therapist 

01:04:45
NARRATOR There was a feeling of community in which the group members…

01:05:25
NARRATOR As the family selects puppets, the therapist observes their individual behaviors and their interaction. Some puppets are chosen immediately, others are rejected or avoided. The selection process provides the therapist with important clues about the dynamics of the family. The particular meaning that the puppet has for the person, usually becomes clear through the interaction and conflict portrayed within the story as well as during the discussion after the story when each person is asked to think about which puppets they chose and why. 

01:06:00
How about introducing your puppets to everybody, so all the puppets can have a chance to meet each other? 

01:06:05
Okay! 

01:06:10
He likes to go first. 

01:06:10
My name is Ron. Good to see you. And this is Duck. Okay! 

01:06:15
I'd like to take a couple of minutes and to try to think together of a way you could start a story, using some of the puppets that you've got. 

01:06:25
NARRATOR Observing the formation of the story, it is often possible to determine family roles. Most families work best when hidden behind a puppet stage, which provides psychic as well as aesthetic distance. 

01:06:40
Okay! And all these creatures… 

01:06:45
Shut up! 

01:06:45
…even though some may look mean, they're all just like us. 

01:06:50
Hah… Uh…Huh… 

01:06:50
Okay! And so we will start. First I will have to change into my fantasy costume. Are you ready? 

01:07:00
Huh… Yes, and I'm gonna go have my coffee. 

01:07:00
Okay, yes please do that. I'm sure you'll look much better when you're done. 

01:07:05
Okay! 

01:07:05
Okay! Hello, Magic Lobster! 

01:07:10
Hello! 

01:07:10
How was your trip? 

01:07:10
Fine! 

01:07:10
Excellent. 

01:07:10
I just wanna tell you guys… 

01:07:10
What? 

01:07:15
…from one species to another, that you can just live under water and be cool. 

01:07:20
Would you like to sing a song for us? 

01:07:20
Okay! 

01:07:20
Okay, sing a song. We all came back together, we brought everything back with us. 

01:07:25
NARRATOR When the story stops, the therapist can continue the interaction by talking directly to the puppets. 

01:07:35
If we could show your story to an audience on television for example, what could we tell them would be the moral of the story? 

01:07:40
You can go somewhere with, with a stranger, but you'll end up in something that you don't know about. 

01:07:55
Hah…Uh… 

01:07:55
Well of course, I would say that there's a lot to learn from a lobster.

Jim Gardner Drama Therapist 

01:09:10
NARRATOR At the Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, Jim Gardner and Roni Ostfield work with blind and partially sighted children in a creative dramatics program. Spontaneous play can help to organize and make sense of the outer world as well as the inner world of feeling. At times, improvisations are humorous that may also reflect underlying worries as in this unplanned drama. 

01:09:35
Well, let's go, come on, let's go! 

01:09:35
Yeah! 

01:09:40
Come on, come on. You can't even stand up, ah, these guys get on my nerves. 

01:09:45
RONI OSTFIELD Pardon me, one of these belongs to me. 

01:09:45
One of these?

RONI OSTFIELD You are my, you know what… 

01:09:55
You gonna have to take this downtown. We're gonna go around cleaning. 

01:09:55
RONI OSTFIELD I'm sorry, I'm her psychiatrist and she escaped from the ah… the asylum. I'd like to take her back where she belongs, but I'm… 

01:10:00
Hahaha… there's more to this than I thought. 

01:10:05
NARRATOR For most children such experiences can be therapeutic, but some children need more specialized help. Trauma therapy focuses on the understanding and working through of conflicts. 

01:10:20
I'll burn it! 

01:10:20
ELLIE IRWIN Drama Therapist And now you have a burn due to bad things are happening to you. 

01:10:25
Ah, alright! How? 

01:10:25
NARRATOR In the drama, feelings and fantasies are expressed and accepted, as therapist and child work towards clarification, control and change. Puppet play and improvisation can be valuable diagnostic as well as therapeutic tools for children and their families. 

01:10:50
Ah…Nah…Ha… I'll attack them around! Oh-oh, get off me. Come on help! Oh-oh-oh, come on I let go. Oh, my nose! 

01:11:00
NARRATOR The same theme of steeling was in his improvised dramas when the pirate, his favorite character stole from the professor. Eventually, the cop fought the pirate, restored what was stolen and solved the case.

01:11:55
NARRATOR And when old age brings losses of people, of home, of health, of mobility, making art can enrich lives and can even lift the weight of depression. 

01:12:05
ELIZABETH LAYTON Artist You heard, and you heard, and you heard, and then you go round and round and round. So I felt I can stand this I'll do something. After my son died, my sister wrote and urged me to, to do something. May be she was into drawing at that time and she thought if I were to draw it might help me. And everybody said; "You don't look like that!" But I knew I look like that, because I had drawn it out of the mirror. 

01:12:40
Voice - Robert Ault Art Therapist 

01:12:45
ROBERT AULT What I find most interesting about this story is that, ten months after she took up contour drawing, Elizabeth Layton's depression had vanished.

ELIZABETH LAYTON And then I was feeling okay.

01:13:10
Well, 94 years old what are you gonna do? It made me feel young! Hahaha…

Because I didn't think that movies will show this like that.

VA Hospital Vermont 

01:13:25
You lose your identity in a hospital. Outside you're an individual, in a hospital you're something that they're working on. But when you start doing something like this, it gives you that feeling back again, that you're actually doing something as a human being. 

01:13:40
SARAH BANKER Art Therapist When you first come into a nursing home, you've given up your home. 

01:13:40
Nursing Home & Hospital New York 

01:13:40
SARAH BANKER And you've given up a great many choices that you had in your life and your daily routines and also a sense of control that you have over your life. And you are very confused and it also leads to a lot of depression. But art, if they begin to explore and work in art, I think they can get that feeling of control back of having choices, their infinite choices in art and their dependency becomes less as they explore and create themselves.

Hmm… Hmmm…

WENDY MILLER He had a stroke which completely incapacitate him, because his left hand was untrained. He could do nothing with it. 

01:14:25
Hmm… Hmmm… 

01:14:25
WENDY MILLER And then when this program started, it occupied his time and his mind, it's not a luxury, it's really a necessity art.

NARRATOR This is WBBN, host from Pennsylvania group of blind children. This is the art room, kids like art, art likes them. It doesn't matter what you can do, you can do art, real good. We have some more work to do. We'll show you what we're gonna do. Watch. 

01:15:00
"We'll Show You What We're Gonna Do!" 

01:15:05
NARRATOR We really didn't know what was gonna happen. When we started we were told that the children had all kinds of problems, things that would make it hard for them to do what we expected them to do. We wanted to see what children like these could do when given art materials and offered freedom. These weren't just ordinary children. They were the kind of children that are called special or exceptional, which is a polite way of saying that they had a lot of things wrong with them. They had labels like mentally retarded, brain damaged, cerebral palsied and the one label that all of them shared no matter what their other disability was that they were blind. 

01:16:10

01:16:15
NARRATOR And then there is David, who zoomed around the paper with marker, with brush who took all the energy he used to use to bite and pinch and kick he put it into his paintbrush and put it into his pictures. Children have so much to say, it helps to know that somebody is interested in listening, in hearing all the ideas and feelings that get stirred up when children use art materials. 

01:16:50
Oh Lawrence angry at you, he is really angry. 

01:16:55
He is angry as (inaudible )? 

01:17:00
No, no, more, he is even angrier. Ooh! He is cutting holes in her, ah, this is easy to cut. 

01:17:15
Now I take the needle and you stick it right in here, then when you are done, it's all over. 

01:17:30
NARRATOR Peter remembered his experience with a doctor in the hospital. 

01:17:35
PETER This is the operating room and that's where Dr. Seeber(ph) was. Then, then the doctor proceeded with the operation, then after they took out my hernia from here to here then after they were done, then they put me back in the bed. Well, I thought that it was a good operation. I never knew how to paint a picture of an operating room before.

01:18:40
Darcy has Lymphoma 

01:19:00
DARCY LYNN Artist The first time I wanted to draw was in intensive care. It would be when I was feeling more conscious, and because I was sedated with a lot of stuff and I think it was more the concern to see if I still had it in me, and I could still do it, I could still do that drawing line, it hadn't been taken away. I think my art, my art really helped me, because it was the only way I could hold on to my own identity. And I think if I didn't have that, it would have been awfully difficult. To be treated for cancer is a long process, and you need something, you need something to hold on to, that's you. 

01:19:40
NARRATOR In work which is true to both art and therapy, people are helped to find, to know and to accept the true self, which may be hidden within behind the masks they wear. 

01:19:55
It lets you let out like, let me let out like what I was mad at and stuff like that. 

01:20:05
What were you mad at? 

01:20:10
Ah, just being in the hospital period. 

01:20:10
You feel someone drawing you get into the space and it's like, I don’t know, it's I, I hadn't been there so long that I didn't wanna go there for some odd reason I guess. Maybe I was afraid of it, that I couldn't do it, you know. But slowly but surely I started doing it again. It was like, yeah!

01:21:10
I don't know what to draw! 

01:21:10
LINDA GANTT Ah, just let your hand remember. So, we've taken all your pictures and we've put them upon the board here in chronological order. 

01:21:20
DARCY LYNN I think it's a way to express all those things they're afraid to express. People are afraid to express so much, the fear, pain, loneliness, embarrassment, all sorts of things that that no one else can have any idea of and they can put that into art. 

01:21:45

01:22:15
[sil.] 

01:22:20
A FILM ABOUT GROWING 

01:22:25
NARRATOR Children and the arts go together, because the arts are a way of taking what comes naturally to children and giving it form. We all know that kids like to move. 

01:22:40
[sil.] 

01:22:50
NARRATOR One of the most helpful things about the arts is that they give children ways of exploring and expressing and articulating so scary feelings. You might wanna mess with you brother, but it's better if you mess with the finger paint. And you might feel like pounding your sister, but it's a lot safer to pound a drum. The angry feelings can go into a story too. The killing is make-believe, and that makes it safe. The punch that can hurt, can become a dance. 

01:23:35
[sil.] 

01:23:40
NARRATOR It can become so highly stylized, and ritualized, that it becomes a thing of beauty, and so those scary, angry, messy feelings can be turned through the arts, into something lovely. Now the same fellow, who has two puppets so angry at each other, can also have two puppets who feel very loving toward each other, because children have all sorts of feelings inside them and the child would begins to feel good, because he knows how to do something. He feels even better, because he has found some grownup who believes in his ability, and who believes in him as a person, who shows him that he likes him, just the way he is. And that good happy feeling, is the feeling that children can get from the arts, from finding out what they can do and learning how to do it. Feeling strong and proud, and really good about themselves. And in the process, growing.
