DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is Grounding Lightstream. This exercise is based on work developed for a well known treatment approach called Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) And it's used to assist individuals who are experiencing a strong negative emotion and (inaudible ) sensations. Let's practice together. Focus on an internal sensation of discomfort that exists in your body. If you don't feel anything right now, allow yourself to recall a time when you did and then allow the sensation to resurface just enough, so you're aware of it again.

DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Now, reflect for a moment and answer the following questions internally. If the discomfort had a shape, what shape would it be? If the discomfort had a size, what size would it be? If the discomfort had a color, what color would it be?

DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY If the discomfort had a temperature, what temperature would it be, hot or cold? If the discomfort had a texture, what texture would it be?

00:02:50
DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY If the discomfort had a sound, what sound would it make, high or low pitch? Now that you're familiar whilst yourself, work the discomfort. Focus now on harnessing the power of your mind to open up your imagination. Picture in your imagination a soothing light coming down from above and gently moving in through the top of your head. Allow yourself to picture this light as healing and moving deeply in and toward the discomfort in your body. Picture that now as best as you can in this moment. Become aware of the color of the soothing light and notice that it's a different color, than the source of your discomfort. This light is healing and restored at to you and it may even appear as just they were a color. Notice whether the light is warm or cool and decide for yourself what would feel best, warm or cool? Whatever you prefer. Using your imagination, picture the light coming in from above through your head and into your body. Notice as the light moves deeper into the shape that holds discomfort in your body and just bear witness. No judgment. Just notice as the light and the shape begin to move together and mingle.

00:05:10
DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY The light moves around the shape, shining through every inch of the shape. Notice as it does this, what happens to the shape? Let's start from the beginning again, noticing whether the shape is different in anyway. Picture in your imagination a soothing light coming down from above and gently moving in through the top of your head. This healing light is moving deeply in and toward the discomfort in your body wherever it lives. Become aware of the color of the soothing light and notice that it's a different color than the source of your discomfort. This light feels healing and restored at to you and it may even be your favorite color. Notice whether the light is warm or cool and decide for yourself what would feel best. Using your imagination picture the light coming in from above through your head and into your body. Notice that the light moves deeply into the shape that holds your discomfort. Just bear witness, no judgment as the light and the shape begin to move together almost vibrating. The light moves around the shape, shining through every inch of the shape. Notice as it does this, what happens to the shape? Allow yourself to continue with this exercise watching this segment over and over again until the shape begins to feel neutral to you, or return to any of the earlier exercises to help you achieve this goal. Practice this again throughout your day whenever you need to be recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
