BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
DR. JON CARLSON Good! Wow! Somebody is listening, that's very good. I'd like to welcome you, this is a demonstration on couples therapy. Ah, we have Farrah and Ted are with us today. Ah, they're gonna help you learn a lot about marriage and help you learn a lot about, ah, ah, at learning in approach to working with couples. Ah, the couple has been married for three years, okay. Ah, their anniversary coming up I think in, ah, about a week, about a week, yeah. Ah, Adlerians have done demonstrations like this since the 1920s, ah, it's a-- it's a kind of the, you know, the goal is to take a couple-- a normal couple and you know, with their normal problems that you know, the same kind of problems that, ah, are couple will have today will be just like the challenges that you probably have in your own marriages or your own relationships. You know, there might be a little bit different but for the most part they are the same and Adlerians believe a lot in the universality of problems. In other words, we face the same kind of challenges as we go through life and so, by working with the couple in front of a, ah, in an audience there is spectator therapy that takes place and you're the spectators and you're really the people who are been therapies you don't know that, that you're the ones that we hope our learning from what our couples is going to be able to teach you. Ah, the Adlerian approach you know, some of you will look on your, ah, objectives for this demonstration and your gonna find out that they have nothing at all to do with what I'm gonna do. The, ah, the objectives are for somebody's hypnosis program and, ah, so, ah, don't get too carried away by that it's not something that, that I did. I submitted them, you know, they had something to do with the-- with probably two objectives. One is be aware of the four stages, ah, that we're going to be going through and, ah, you know, I'm not sure but the second one is a look at the positive nature of, ah, the program. So you look at those two things and, and the four, you know, I guess what call him steps or stages that you need to know. The first is of relationship stage and second is an assessment stage-- sorry about this-- this thing could be feeding back-- second is an assessment stage and then, third, ah, is insight and then the fourth is reorientation. So, ah, it's, it's pretty similar to you know, most Adler therapy approaches, ah, is a positive approach. There's a lot of encouragement to mo-- motivate and, ah, you know, I want you to know that I've not met this couple. I wanna get some feedback. I'm gonna look this way and so, that might change the effect to the microphone. Ah, I have met the couple, you know, before today. We just chattered in the hall for a little bit although they did fill out some forms for me and, ah, and these are the same forms that all of you have. Ah, they're on the websites so you can look those up. Uhm, and don't-- you know, turn them into me please, ah, but there, there your forms and they're on the website and the forms are blank, you know, I'm certainly not gonna put up our couples information for you to have because of hippo would be here within moments, I'm sure. So, so let me talk a little bit about what I know, okay? Ah, and this is what I know from their inventory said in and my little bit to talk with them outside and this is Farrah and, and, and Farrah is the eight of 11 children. Ah, Farrah was, ah, born in Iran and she grew up in Germany and then moved to the United States and I want Farrah to correct me if I-- you know, but I do things wrong and, ah, you know, it's-- and then, Ted will you know, get the same opportunity. Ah, she reports an abusive relationship with her mother and a detached relationship with her father. Ah, there are some additional history of abuse and she left her home and moved to Germany by herself at age 17. Ah, she reports a little bit of depression and, ah, recently, ah, she learn that a kidney transplant she had when she was younger is failing. She's currently on the transplant list and is waiting for a new kidney. Ah, she takes medications that are related to this, and, ah, I don't know, funny being in those much about it and a rejection medicine but its not lot of fun. Ah, she reports chronic pain and some sleep issues and some excessive energy, ah, then you see. Ah, she kind of has described herself as workaholic. Is that an okay, for you? 

00:05:30
FARRAH Sure. 

00:05:30
DR. JON CARLSON Sure, okay, here-- we gone okay, all right. Now, one of the things she also noted in the form is I'm gonna make a diagnosis of her based upon this and, ah, she has strength in turning negatives into positives and she does not let things put her down, ah, and she seems to have what in the literature, she meets all the criteria for post-traumatic growth. Ah, she... 

00:06:00
FARRAH Thank you. 

00:06:00
DR. JON CARLSON ...and, ah, she is a, you know, remarkable, ah, woman for you know, the growth that she shown and you'll find out a little bit about because we talk in a moment. Ah, in her family we tried to do the Adlerians do about family constellation and I asked her some questions and she found her place in her family through her-- you know, having the most intelligence, being the hardest worker, being the most obedient and yet, also the most rebellious. Now, that's kind of a conflict but, ah, she will-- may reenacted to that. Ah, she got her own way in the most, has high expectations-- you're enjoying this-- high aspirations, ah, she desires to excel and yet she get punish the most. Ah, she describes it-- is that pretty accurate, does it? 

00:06:55
FARRAH Yes. 

00:06:55
DR. JON CARLSON Is that like she is today? 

00:07:00
TED Yeah, that's exactly what she is today. 

00:07:00
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, all right. All good. Okay, so, we can hit the ground running her a little bit. She said her dad was a hard worker, ah, who really listen to mom and love mom. And then, she said her mother was the opposite of that. She was, ah, you know, not a good mother, okay, wasn't really a mother. So, we will regret little bit of a teeter-totter that we're gonna talk about. Ah, she sees herself as sensitive but really good at hiding her feelings. Smart, independent, self-reliant, caring and very positive. Good? 

00:07:40
FARRAH Yes. 

00:07:40
DR. JON CARLSON Right. Very good. So as the part of this as we can get to the essence a little bit by asking certain questions that help us to understand things a little bit better. Now, I ask, ah, Farrah to give a couple of early recollections and Adlerians to this sometimes is helpful but we ask people to go back in time and to remember the earliest things that they can remember and, ah, I-- I'm not so interested in the content. In other words, what exactly she remembers because the, the content is, is, ah, reflective of what things are like for her today and where she's at today. And we find that this recollections change like if someone goes through counseling or cycle therapy that they'll have maybe similar recollections but they're slightly different after cycle therapy is taken place but hers was-- I was about 9-years-old. I was being left out of my siblings activities for the Persian New Year, I felt isolated and abandoned. I also felt scared because I knew that being left alone not that I would be in trouble from my mother, okay. And then, there was a second one, I was 13-years-old and I was sick with my kidney, everybody turned their back on me when my kidneys were failing. No one was helping me financially or donating a kidney. Is this how it goes, yeah? 

00:09:20
FARRAH Yes. 

00:09:20
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, and so, you'd say, "Why do you ask that question?" You know, why do you-- why would that be important? One of the things we could gather from this is that Farrah has learned not to trust other people and that she is someone who is going to needs to take care of herself if she's going to survive. Does that make sense? 

00:09:45
FARRAH Yes. 

00:09:45
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, okay. Is that makes to you? 

00:09:45
TED Yup. Yes she has, ah, on driving need to take care of herself first. 

00:09:50
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, all right. So that a lot of, you know, independence and so, we give this just from asking a question like that. And so, let me move on to Ted's and, and I'm not sure that I understand him but we'll try. Ah, Ted was one of six children but he was really one of two children. Now, he, he was twin and when he was born he was adopted and then when he was 10 or 12, his mother-- his mother died and so, then he has another mother, so he's got three mother's. A birth mother and two mother's. Okay, and so, ah, one of the things we, we look at with this is, ah, you know, and this gets a little bit complicated but one of the things that we look at with this is we find that somebody develops their personality and early in their life certainly that we guess by six years, you know, some people say four years that you're started to head in this certain, certain direction. So, we can find out these things and I don't know how these fit but, ah, I compared him with his sister, the, the twin because that two enlist within. Compared to that he was the least intelligent, the least hard working, the least good grace, the person who helped around the house the most. He was the least critic of other people, he got his own way the least. He had the most temper. He had the least aspirations and was not really trying to excel and then the least good behavior. I don't know if any of that fit, is that? What do you think? 

00:11:40
TED Pretty accurate, yeah. 

00:11:40
DR. JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:40
TED I tend to do not violent too much. 

00:11:40
DR. JON CARLSON That's-- okay. Yeah, and are any of those stand out more than any of the others? 

00:11:50
TED Ah, I think probably the one about, uhm, not getting my way the most. 

00:11:50
DR. JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:50
TED I just really tend to let anybody else go first. It was a lot easier. 

00:11:55
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, all right if that's would fit. All right, so maybe other oriented you know, thinking more about others than himself which you know, for that's an attribute for lots of us, isn't it? I mean, that's a strength it doesn't need to be seen as a weakness you know, of the-- we have most to the world is outer centered. Ah, he, he indicated the-- that his father was a hard worker that like a lot of men gone a lot and, ah, his mother one of him was busy firm, fair and smart probably mother two? Or three? 

00:12:35
TED That's right. My mom when I was, ah, 13. 

00:12:35
DR. JON CARLSON Thirteen, so that mother number three was busy firm, fair and smart. Ah, he doesn't see himself as very connected to his parents, he enlisted in the military and, ah, he hasn't returned. He is not Persian, he is, ah, he's from the State of Washington, I don't know what that means but, ah, and, and, and he doesn't have any, ah, health issues that stand out. He reports that he's a dreamer who was intelligent with a low self-esteem and low self-confidence. Sound? 

00:13:15
TED Pretty accurate, yeah. 

00:13:15
DR. JON CARLSON Pretty accu-- well, okay. Anything you change on that that didn't come often? 

00:13:20
TED Little more driven as I've gotten older. A little more driven towards goals especially since I'd been married a little bit more. 

00:13:25
DR. JON CARLSON Okay. I wonder why, you know, okay. 

00:13:30
TED It's a good thing. 

00:13:35
DR. JON CARLSON Keep telling yourself that. Ah, so but when I ask Ted what his, ah, earliest recollection was, ah, he said, "I was playing with my favorite gun. It was really detailed it like really works, ah, and I would shoot at the relatives for fun." He wasn't fond of relatives but... 

00:14:00
TED They fall asleep their fair game, that's all. 

00:14:05
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, you go then not moving, yeah. "And I had it taken away and I remember how much I like it and I was told that I could get it back and I never did. And I kept thinking have I been good enough, yet?" Okay, so you can see how that might fit into somebody who is really interested in you know, maybe pleasing and, and is very important to him about, am I good enough. You know, because we would say that if you're good enough you'll get the goodies in life. You know, your weapon back but I don't-- we're not going to go there but just the, the symbolism behind it. Is it good, you know? 

00:14:50
TED No. 

00:14:50
DR. JON CARLSON No, we don't wanna it know no weapons, okay. So I ask them, ah, again, again, this is kind of short something, you know, want them to hear and correct anything. I ask them what their goals were and Farrah had a goal of she said, "My understanding is that we would like to work in how my husband perceived me in my illness. It seems like his always trying to make up for that. Ah, I also want him to feel like he deserves things too. Also, to build up his self-esteem and self-confidence and to achieve more. In other words, to focus more on himself and less on me," is that, yeah? 

00:15:30
FARRAH Yes, that's correct. 

00:15:30
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, okay. All right. Then, and so, then we ask Ted what his goal was in, he would like her to be easier on herself, yeah, and to really to see just how amazing that she is, okay. Is that? Anything else you guys would like to add? 

00:15:50
TED I just-- I sometimes just wish she were just dialed back a little bit on herself not on me so much but just on herself because it worries me cuz a healthy person can probably do that but it worries me that it might have complications for her and then that just bothers me but she doesn't have any ability to do that. It wouldn't be her nature I guess. 

00:16:10
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, so, so the concern is that she's in high gear all the time and then you worry that this is counter to her health? 

00:16:20
TED Yeah, it worries me that its counter to her health and I just-- I don't know what would happen if she ever got a chance to rest every time there's a new challenge she takes it one and if there isn't one, she finds one really quick of some sort, something that contest to fight it's like kind of thing, it's like jousting dragons. She has to find one all the time. 

00:16:40
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, quite good, that's helpful. You too, any? Now, he would-- he is saying as if he really likes to, to show how much he cares for you by, by that and you appreciate that? 

00:16:55
FARRAH Yeah. 

00:16:55
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah? 

00:16:55
FARRAH This is the way I am. I cannot change. 

00:17:00
DR. JON CARLSON Ah, okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. I've and, and so, is, is there anything else that you might be able to think of that, that we, we should talk about I mean, you had mention one thing that I think it would be just too sure briefly that part of, of your history was you've had some really, ah, near death experiences, you know, like four of them not just one, you know? Ah, yeah, and, and that's another way that I came up with that post-traumatic growth is that she comes out of these experiences really thriving, you know, is it? You, you grow from this? 

00:17:50
FARRAH Yeah. 

00:17:50
DR. JON CARLSON You do talk a little bit your philosophy about that? 

00:18:00
FARRAH About? 

00:18:00
TED About what they do for you and what they mean, what they do for you and what they mean to you, maybe. 

00:18:05
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:05
FARRAH Ah. 

00:18:05
DR. JON CARLSON Ah, but you know with your, your philosophy about when you have challenges and the things happen what do you do? 

00:18:15
FARRAH Ah-- 

00:18:15
DR. JON CARLSON You don't have to go with that. I don't want you to go into the challenges, I just want you to talk generally about the challenges I'm trying to. 

00:18:20
FARRAH You know, I just believe anything is possible and I don't see problem as if people see the problems. I always find a way to take care of my problems. I always thinks the negative things will turn positive. 

00:18:40
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-huh, yeah, and it that's kind of a philosophy that she has which is independence to a fault, right? And then, Ted likes to show her how much he loves her by pointing out things for her. 

00:19:00
TED I wanted to see that not everything is a-- not everything is like a contest. That doesn't always have to be a, a conflict or a fight. There is things you got let go that are important. 

00:19:10
DR. JON CARLSON And she appreciates that? 

00:19:10
TED Ah, not yet. 

00:19:15
DR. JON CARLSON Yup, you know, that's something you might want to rethink beause to see if the, the hallmark of her character has been to be strong and independent and not to have people feel sorry for me and, ah, so that the way you would show love to her would be just the opposite of that. It would be to identify the strengths like you know, can't you move a little faster, you know? Yeah. 

00:19:45
TED I, I can-- when you said that it maybe think it something when we had gone to, uhm, we took a trip together and the only time that we generally seem not to have, uhm, a little conflict over me trying to take care of her and she's saying she's okay as when we're both doing something that's, uhm, physically strenuous that we took a trip and we walked a more than I have ever done before every single day and she didn't stop once, didn't blink once, love it and I didn't ask for how she was feeling once, it didn't even cross my mind, I just did like a regular anybody I was going along with and she even tell me later that was important. 

00:20:20
DR. JON CARLSON And that work, that was a very intimate experience? 

00:20:25
FARRAH Yeah. 

00:20:25
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:20:25
FARRAH Ah, I think when we came back from Europe he could understand why I do things the way I want it. 

00:20:30
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, right. So stop of an indoors and stop doing all of those things and, ah, yeah. 

00:20:40
TED I kind to try to get to the point where I'd been on doing a little bit of watching if its a case of me just doing it or she really does need to help like if she just really is worn out. Then, I'd try to do I'm-- I miss it sometimes what I try to do is just to help but a lot of times I leave things alone, let her do home rather than doing around the house. 

00:20:55
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:20:55
TED Right away just because she tells she really wants to do those and it feels weird cuz I think I'm helping you know, I'm trying to take care of it. 

00:21:05
DR. JON CARLSON What, what doesn't he know? 

00:21:10
FARRAH I think that I needed help nobody was there so I don't anybody help anymore. 

00:21:15
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:20
FARRAH So when I was eight, when I was nine, I needed the help. When I was you know. 

00:21:25
DR. JON CARLSON Right. And so, when somebody tries to help you that tells you that you're weak? 

00:21:35
FARRAH Yeah. That I'm like dying, you know. 

00:21:35
DR. JON CARLSON I'm dying. Okay, yeah. Okay. 

00:21:40
TED You know, it's a bit-- it's kind of funny cuz her-- our daughter Sonia actually mention it to me. She told me that she want me to quit helping mom so much because she said it makes her feel like mom is sick, like mom can't do something. 

00:21:50
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-huh. 

00:21:50
 And I told her that the point of it that mom shouldn't have to do anything that I should be up and just helped her without even thinking about it and actually Sonia was the first one to tell me that she's like, well, I don't like seeing her not doing things, it makes me think she is sicker than she is so I like to see mom just doing things because that's why I just ignore like she's sick, I just treat her like mom and I just have her do things. 

00:22:15
DR. JON CARLSON Did-- so your daughter know you pretty well? 

00:22:15
FARRAH Yeah, very well. 

00:22:15
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:20
TED They were very much alike. 

00:22:20
DR. JON CARLSON I know, I know, yeah, yeah, but, but it sounds like out of the mouth of a baby you could, you could learn a lot about your wife. There's a famous psychologist who said we shouldn't show down things, did you ever hear that term? 

00:22:35
TED No. 

00:22:35
DR. JON CARLSON You kept-- you kept saying I should do this and I should do that and, ah, is that true with your wife? 

00:22:45
TED I think I've-- as we've been married a little longer and as I've got a little bit older I'd learned a little bit about trying to give her the things that just make her her, you don't live in long and so, there's-- it's funny it will be some things around the house that all, I'll forget about but our-- we, we have a really seems really bad but we have really good, uhm, household balance slate. She takes care of the house really good, we take care of the chores together there's not usually much argument but every now, we'll just leave one completely alone and I'll just let her get completely out of control so has something to do, something to work on. I swear, seriously. 

00:23:15
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, wow. 

00:23:20
TED Not too bad but it's-- because if I do it and I take care of everything she'll actually come down and say, "Well, I was gonna do that. I wanted to do that, you know, you don't need to do that." 

00:23:25
DR. JON CARLSON So what would happen if you were to tell her I didn't clean up the basement because I love you? 

00:23:35
TED I actually told her a couple of times I'd clean things up just because I was tired of it and I knew that she would have the time and actually that got the best response out of her. 

00:23:45
DR. JON CARLSON That's was good, yeah. That was good. To leave that one end, yeah. 

00:23:50
TED You would just-- you just treat her like I just-- I have to forgive just ignore that-- am I need to try and treat her like she's sick and just treat her like she's just a normal person. 

00:24:00
DR. JON CARLSON Right. Yeah. 

00:24:00
TED But that kind it makes a little worried too because I want her to be able to get you know, the help in the, the medical help in the treatment that she needs and if everybody just thinks she is normal that was gonna do anything. So I feel kind of-- if we act like everything else is normal everybody else is gonna think everything is normal and that worries me a little bit. 

00:24:20
DR. JON CARLSON Does, does she act like things are normal? 

00:24:25
TED Well, every time she goes to the darker she looks like she's absolutely healthy. 

00:24:25
DR. JON CARLSON Right, but you keep going to the doctor and you're on a transplant list and you're? 

00:24:35
FARRAH I have to go every four weeks. 

00:24:35
DR. JON CARLSON Every four weeks you go to the doctor. Do you think she's to go more often? 

00:24:40
TED No, I don't undergoing more often because it's really-- it's really stressful cuz your waiting for the other shoot of gun. 

00:24:45
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, I mean, because-- cuz she's really a medical and normally she is really one of a kind, you know, that she is lived so long with this kidney and, yeah, she's strong. 

00:24:55
FARRAH Yeah. 

00:25:00
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. And you heard that. Yeah. But let me just ask, a di-- different questions just, ah, what will come back to this. If I were to really want to know you who would be three people that I should get to know? Three people that if I were to get to know Farrah and of three people of I were to get to know, ah, Ted, who would that be? 

00:25:25
TED Three people for you? 

00:25:30
FARRAH For me? 

00:25:30
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-mm. 

00:25:30
TED People that have... 

00:25:35
DR. JON CARLSON Ah, and this is a, a different kind of a question it has more about inclusiveness and you try to find out who is in somebody's world and that's gonna be a way that you're gonna be able to better understand them. 

00:25:45
FARRAH President of the United States. 

00:25:50

00:25:50

00:27:20
TED I think if there is three people that would probably know me, uhm, one would be Farrah, she doesn't only completely but she does know parts of me that nobody else does. 

00:27:30
DR. JON CARLSON Okay. So your wife Farrah not Farrah Fawcett? 

00:27:35
TED Not Farrah Fawcett, no. 

00:27:35
DR. JON CARLSON Good. 

00:27:35
TED No. 

00:27:35
DR. JON CARLSON That's a good answer, yeah. 

00:27:35
TED It's very important to keep that straight. 

00:27:40
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:27:40
TED My daughter, Sonia, she actually understands me a lot better than somebody than somebody who I met that 8-years-old should. 

00:27:45
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-mm. 

00:27:45
TED She does understand me a lot better. 

00:27:50
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, so those are two people who really, really know you well, uh-huh? 

00:27:50
TED Well, I think they knew me-- I think my daughter understood pretty quickly when, ah, we first met when she was about eight and then I think Farrah has gotten understand me more as she sees like how actually live not just how I was when we are dating, how actually how I live so she understands me more. 

00:28:05
DR. JON CARLSON And she accepts you. 

00:28:10
TED She accepts some of it but some of it does-- she does, uhm, she does want me to improve on some things and so, I try to take those as things that I can use for strengths and I'm trying to tell her when she's being pushy and I'll say no that doesn't need to be change that's just fine. 

00:28:25
DR. JON CARLSON All right. 

00:28:25
TED Uhm, we still got no agreement on that yet though. 

00:28:30
DR. JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:28:30
TED I mean, that ancestor would be another one. 

00:28:30
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:30
FARRAH So you say the people that know you or you can relate to. 

00:28:35
DR. JON CARLSON I couldn't hear. 

00:28:35
FARRAH The question. 

00:28:35
TED She was asking if you were referring to people that we know or people that we can relate to, she know the people she relates to. 

00:28:40
DR. JON CARLSON Either way I don't care. 

00:28:40
TED Yeah, okay. 

00:28:40
DR. JON CARLSON It doesn't care it's just the-- just the question, yeah. And who is your third one, did you? 

00:28:50
TED And my twin sister. 

00:28:50
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, yeah. 

00:28:50
TED She understand why I do things even before I do half the time so she'll mention and I'll totally forget that that was something we did when were younger. 

00:29:00
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, okay, good. Nice. Ah, discuss me a little bit more of an idea about what's important for each of you and say in and for Farrah this seems like a big thing as to be strong and to be powerful and to be, ah, ah, you know, on top of things and for Ted is saying that's really important that he'd be understood and, ah, so the way they work with each other as she keeps trying to empower him and he wants understanding and, and and he keeps trying to nurture her and she wants empowerment, isn't it lovely? Can, can you see where that's gonna go in a little bit of you know, okay, but you can see why, why something like this can be really helpful even though it sounds like such an innocent question, yeah? Is that make sense to you, you look like you're having a moment of insight? 

00:29:55
TED Yeah, that's, that's part insightful. 

00:29:55
DR. JON CARLSON That's three. Go. 

00:30:00
TED Ah, it's very insightful. I actually in a-- I've always just-- I got married a lot later when I was older and I was just assumed that marriage is where I was supposed to have some kind like conflict of friction. 

00:30:10
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:30:10
TED And it with us would just be normal and would eventually figure out how to get along with each other. 

00:30:15
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-mm. 

00:30:15
TED And I figured as long as we talk about it that would be okay and I knew that we're different because the only, the only relationship I'd been in more than like three months is with somebody that's like completely the opposite of anything I am. 

00:30:25
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:30:25
TED Anyone that was similar to me I couldn't handle very long. 

00:30:30
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:30:30
TED So, it has to be good. 

00:30:30
DR. JON CARLSON If-- and as almost like that teeter-totter kind of a thing, you know, that and, and what you're doing is loving her the way you wanna be love and she is loving you the way she wants to be love. You know, it's real simple but my wife and I we laugh about this but I have been married forever and, ah, yeah, you know, this is just kind of you know, she's sort of just seems like that that you know, 46 years and, and, ah, you know, we were talking and it took us 25 years to figure this out. My wife loves cards, any special occasion she'll give me cards, all kinds of cards. I hate cards. You know, I just think its a big thing for Hallmark to make money so I don't give her cards, she would get me four or five and just annoy the hell out of me, you know. And, and so, now we've got this work out, when I give her just a ton of cards and she says you know, happy whatever I didn't get you any cards and I got yes! And, and that's, ah, simple example of way I was loving her you know, the way-- you know, I wanted to love. You might think about how you could do that, you know, you could love adult differently? Like, how do you think you could provide more understanding and acceptance of him? 

00:31:55
FARRAH Of him do I say? 

00:31:55
DR. JON CARLSON Of him, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 

00:32:00
FARRAH Just the way he is. 

00:32:00
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. Just the way he is. Yes. That's right, you see, yeah. It was good, you see. That's what he would lo-- that's he would avoid there's a kiss that would have done that you see but instead he you know, but-- but you know, this is helpful. Yup! Maybe you could tell what's a recent conflict that you might have had you know, maybe in the last... 

00:32:30
[sil.] 

00:32:35
TED She is German. 

00:32:35
DR. JON CARLSON Ah, she's-- yeah. 

00:32:35
TED I, I drive and I learn to drive here. 

00:32:40
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-mm. 

00:32:40
TED No, American driver will be ever be as good as German driving ever. 

00:32:40
DR. JON CARLSON Wow! 

00:32:40
TED And it's constantly a conflict how I drive and I try to explain her that I've survive 40 years with the way that I drive doing just fine and that the only time I ever come close to having an accident is when she screams or makes a little noise or grabs the dashboard. 

00:32:55
DR. JON CARLSON Oh my, yeah. 

00:33:00
TED We have that when just about everyday. 

00:33:00
DR. JON CARLSON I see. Oh! Do you need a second car? 

00:33:10
TED I bought her one, she has one. I don't see anything when she drives. I just sit in the seat and I relax, don't say a peep. 

00:33:15
DR. JON CARLSON It sounds like you found a solution. 

00:33:20
TED Yeah, about four other religions that I'm familiar with now cuz I see prayers in about five languages when I drive with her but it's I don't care, I trust her. I trust her. It's gonna be okay. 

00:33:30
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:33:30
TED And in all honesty if it isn't its gonna too late to say anything about it so I just kinda relax. 

00:33:35
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, and, and if you go back to that you know, simple notion that she likes power, she wants to be in control and you want some understanding and it doesn't happen there, you know, the-- and, and, ah, you know, it sounds like when you are letting her drive that works a lot better and, and that might be the best solution you could come up with her now, yeah. 

00:34:00
TED We, we actually started doing that. It works pretty good. 

00:34:05
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:34:05
DR. JON CARLSON Except she scared of my car so when we wanted to go some place she won't take it but she'll tell me how I should be driving it. So when I'm driving I, I kind of-- I kinda feel like you wanna just takeover and drive and she's like no, no and she just wants to tell me how to drive so I try to listen and see how that works. 

00:34:20
DR. JON CARLSON So, you know, you probably have to have some rules about driving you know, who over takes the keys gets to choose, you would like that, yeah? 

00:34:30
FARRAH I wasn't, I wasn't like that before. I have a high blood pressure. 

00:34:35
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-mm. 

00:34:35
FARRAH And that it's really I have to have a really distance from the next-- you know, far from me. 

00:34:45
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:34:45
FARRAH It really-- I need panic it just the medication that affect me. 

00:34:50
TED Then actually I do have to say that's change in the last few years. It has-- it used to be that way. She is very sensitive to side movement and things so that's what part of what a problem I have cuz when I try to be cautious of that she tells me that I'm kinda babying her and I'm trying-- I tried to explain and read just to understand that you, in more sensitive and nervous. So that's one that's tricky cuz I have to acknowledge that it's because of the medicine, it's because of her illness. 

00:35:10
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, but it becomes a little trickier too because of the, the chemicals that we are off after you'd been married for about two or three years and, and when knows drugs tend to you know, go away, you tend, ah, open up your mouth a little more and. 

00:35:30
TED Yeah, not so inhibited, yeah. 

00:35:30
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, that's great, you got it and-- but you were just mentioning something that just happen that was pretty simple in terms of when we were walking in from outside. 

00:35:40
FARRAH Oh yeah, we went-- we were talking outside about you know, I, I told you that I have pain. 

00:35:50
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:35:50
FARRAH I have always pain and... 

00:35:50
DR. JON CARLSON She's got lots of pain. You can-- you can't tell it because remember when she is somebody who's really good at hiding things, okay. 

00:36:00
FARRAH And as soon as we walk in he told me, "honey, do you have pain? Where you have pain? I didn't know you have a pain." 

00:36:05
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, right and what could you have done? Uhm, I mean if you this was gonna be to enlightened chat. 

00:36:15
TED Well, this was actually the statement right after that I told her I, I told her literally right after I said, "I'm sorry," and I said, but I was kind of joking with her too but I said that's something I can't do anything about and I just kinda kissed her and we went on did-- but of course, we were doing the rest of the day. I can't do anything about that. 

00:36:30
DR. JON CARLSON Is there something else you could do? Say by in essence true? Yes? 

00:36:35
FARRAH How can I told him that, well, you say that's why I don't talk about this stuff. 

00:36:40
DR. JON CARLSON That shuts her down and she doesn't share openly but what you could say and I wonder if you would like this. If you were say really admired the way you cope with your pain. What would happen if you said that? 

00:36:55
FARRAH Like? 

00:36:55
DR. JON CARLSON If he had-- if he really like the way you handled pain, kept it to yourself and show that you're strong, 

00:37:05
FARRAH Oh, I love it. 

00:37:10
DR. JON CARLSON See? 

00:37:10
FARRAH I love it. 

00:37:10
DR. JON CARLSON Yes, yeah, it see-- I mean, I think that just the mental note of editing which is something that we all have to do in marriages as we move along. You have to speak to her strengths and you would probably need to respond back as I really appreciate the way you think about me cuz he is thinking about you in a positive way and you'd like that, yeah. But, you know, one of the things as if there's a lot of this little rubs to go on that we just-- they tend to build up and there was nothing here of any substance really I mean, you know, driving the car or making to comment about, ah, you know, pain or why don't you tell me about it, ah, is just different styles and different levels of understanding, yeah, and her goal if we went back to that was it she really wanted you to just really kind of to respect her that, ah, you know you treat her like she's on that epic walk that you had where you walk forever and you just kind of ignore her and said maybe pick it up a little bit, ah, and she really like that, yeah. And you need to add some talk to him when he is doing that you know, like this is the time I feel really good that really turns me on when you don't say things or try to you know, yeah, you think you could do this things? 

00:38:45
TED I'd love to give it a try. 

00:38:50
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, and so, you could try, could you do it? I'm a big thing about trying and doing. If somebody says they'll tu-- you know, if you guys know that. 

00:38:55
TED I have a hard time, I have a hard time changing how I think about that but I, I think that I do remember more when I remember that she was like that and I remember how she responded to it. I more likely to do it I just have to kinda think before I engage my mouth next time. That's a little tricky, 

00:39:10
DR. JON CARLSON That's just-- yeah, that's just the decision of you one suffer her or not. 

00:39:15
TED Good point. 

00:39:20
DR. JON CARLSON And, and sometimes we say things like that cuz it makes a little easier to remember, yeah. Yeah, how about you, do you think you could begin to see the strength that he has when he leaves you alone and you know, allows you to be yourself? 

00:39:40
FARRAH Yeah, I'm sure. 

00:39:40
DR. JON CARLSON Okay. Yeah, okay. What are other things you wanted to talk about and, ah, if not would have a little bit of time for some comments from our audience. We done this for about 40 minutes and then, the audience would have 20 minutes and so, is that would be okay with you guys? 

00:39:55
TED I'm fine with that actually. I'm fine. 

00:39:55
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, so if anybody might have comments for me here, com-- comments for our couple but the end-- before we do I wanna give them a big you know, round of applause so we don't thank them for. Thank you. Thank you for teaching. Thank you. Yeah, even that you might need that, we'll see, you know. 

00:40:15
 That was very beneficial how you added more, more information than we normally do that and take base on a Adlerian perve-- uhm, perspective. Uhm, my question also be it appears that there's obviously cultural differences as well so how are those affect to relationship. 

00:40:35
DR. JON CARLSON There's obviously-- 

00:40:35
 Cultural. 

00:40:35
DR. JON CARLSON Cultural, yeah? And well, I'd tried to give to talk of just a little bit ask them what cultural questions that were in you know, Farrah is not sure what culture she is a member whether she is German or American or, ah, you know, Iranian and it's hard to her, ah, but and so, that was something I don't know much about and did you guys have any insight if there's cultural things in your marriage? 

00:41:05
TED There are some cultural differences as far as like how families are built but I try to adapt to the ones that she has told me that are important and not always and not always the Persian one. Sometimes she has a very strong fondness for the German things that she was raise with and so, she'll say that they have a better way of doing something, almost everyday something goes by where she's like what the German way of doing this is better, so. 

00:41:35
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, you know, and maybe that's the German stubbornness that some of us hear about, you know, the strong will nature of the, of Germans you know, that it might fit in to this cuz we had a hard time identifying that even though I was pretty certain that they were, yeah, there's probably something there but for Farrah has-- is kind of rejected the Persian culture and so it's kind of-- its a reverse of thing, you know, rather than the affect of trying to understand that culture, you understand the opposite of that culture which maybe Germany. 

00:42:05
FARRAH My culture. 

00:42:05
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, here we go. Okay, here we go, yeah. 

00:42:10
 Ah, Dr. Carlson - 

00:42:10
DR. JON CARLSON Yup. 

00:42:15
 - I have a question about the way you were preceding you know, your craft, the way you thought about the cases. 

00:42:20
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-mm. 

00:42:20
 Excuse me for case. It sounded like, ah, the walk in the forest for a while you know, that conversation was nice, it was like a picnic and, ah, then when you sprung that paradoxical insight its everyone around me gasp and I did too, I mean, I was like in, in a very positive way. It was like affairs caught in the trap or something you know. The, the question I have is, uhm, were the questions to the couple in the beginning related directly to the way you use that in sight or was her some other way you work? 

00:43:10
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm, yeah, I don't know. I mean, ah, yeah, yeah, I mean you know, a lot of us we-- you know, I just do things without really you know, having this great forethought of a plan but I wanna make sure that they understand some things that are gonna be useful for them. I wanna make sure that I normalize things for them because I want them to understand how these things might have some unique twist to that, ah, there's, there's a lot of normality in, in, in every relationship, and I want them also to understand this issue that's gonna be a problem for them forever. I mean, this is not gonna go away about, about how Farrah wants to be really, really strong and, ah, Ted really wants to be understood and appreciated and you know, in some ways they married the wrong people, you know, if, if you know, if, if they wanted somebody who is going to play up to their strength or play up to their you know, understanding but you know what that's true with all of us. You know we all marry somebody who is really fundamentally different and you know, when we talk about opposite attracting there's really a lot of literature you can read Helen Fisher's study about pheromones and how were drawn towards people who are different from us, ah, and, and we're repelled from people who were very similar to us and so, we can see this here. Now, they have to find some ways rather than to change the differences, what's they've been trying to do before today to try to show some more appreciation for those differences and that's what I'm trying to do. I try to always add some an insight though, you know, a kind to deal with at Adler called spitting in someone soup. And spitting in someone soup as you can-- it looks the same and you can keep at-- eating that but it's not the same, you know. And so, you know, I was attempting to you know, do something around those lines. Yeah, that's mine in and of itself from that, okay, yeah. 

00:45:15
 Thank you. Uhm, my observation is that at one point, ah, for I said that's who I am, that's my cha-- character I cannot change it. 

00:45:25
DR. JON CARLSON Strong. 

00:45:30
 Right. Now, my question is, she is accepting to change whether she is aware or not and, ah, so my question would be would you address it at this point or would hear agreement to change, we'll paint later and come up that stronger maybe German... 

00:45:50
DR. JON CARLSON Right. 

00:45:50
 Uhm, ah, tendency? 

00:45:55
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:45:55
 That's the question. 

00:45:55
DR. JON CARLSON I think that's a good question. Right now, I'm certainly not gonna go in the front door, you know, because that's not gonna work that you know, that just going to, uhm, make her reactive to me if I said, you know, you really need to change, come on now you're here to change, you know but it isn't gonna work that way but I can ask a different question. Can you show understanding you know, for your husband, ah, when he points out your strengths? Sure, she can do that without any trouble and that that would be a big change. That would be a win-win both for them. Yeah? Is it? 

00:46:30
 When I say, "this is the way I am," I mean, when it comes to survival sight nothing end. 

00:46:40
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, yeah, you know, we don't know enough about when-- we haven't know about but she's an amazing person and when she talks about survival this is really survival and so when she does this thing she does that's why she's here because she is really a tough cookie and, and, so it isn't like the kind of stuff. It's really hard that the three of us are talking for you know, Ted and I to understand what that's like, you know, because we haven't been there. 

00:47:10
TED I'd been through some military training and some things on my own but they're nothing compared to they said doesn't-- it-- I don't think, I don't thinking anybody that I'd ever talk to my parents, grandparents, anybody they ever talk or met anybody that survived the kinds of things so when you run into this you don't have a lot of things to respond the rest. I'd swear I'm given a lot of times I'm just like that you know, if its work for you and if you know what you're doing just keep do-- doing it but at the same time I feel so responsible that its times for her rest. She doesn't need to do that. 

00:47:40
DR. JON CARLSON And posture that she is gonna take that into her health too and she is gonna keep thriving. Yeah, you need to know that certainly. 

00:47:45
 Hi, I wanna just drop by just thanking Farrah and Ted for their openness and their run on ability for doing this in front of all of us. 

00:47:50
DR. JON CARLSON I figure it, yeah, that's why she's so great. Yeah, yeah, okay. You're, you're good teachers. 

00:48:00
 Uhm, I have question about, uhm, non-verbal communication, uhm, particularly Farrah and Ted body language and I was wondering if, if you would, uhm, if you would be clinically appropriate to even suggest that they each switch the posture to the posture of their spouse because as far as loving each other the way the one would wanna be loved it seems to be enacting itself very clearly in their body language. 

00:48:30
DR. JON CARLSON That-- that's-- that is clearly wonderful observation you made, you know, that's very, very insightful. Do, do you get what that would be? So how is you feel switching and putting your-- put, put your arm-- when you put your arm around her? 

00:48:50
TED That, that makes me feel I can leave her alone. 

00:48:50
DR. JON CARLSON Can, can-- could you hold his hand? Could you reach for his hand? 

00:49:00
FARRAH Yeah. 

00:49:00
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, I figured out. Okay, that's good. There sig-- but you know, we have to go over there and I think that's really great. Ah, again, that would be something that would be worth doing. Yeah, I thought its true. I thought I got to deal too much show but, ah, and not enough but it's really good. You can see how hard it is to do and so, that's good. Yeah, here you go again. 

00:49:25
 Can I, ah, follow-up with that question? Over here. Uhm-- 

00:49:30
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, over here. Okay, there we go, yeah? 

00:49:30
 I really appreciated your ability to help clarify the solution and helping them take a look of what each one can do a little bit differently and it kinda fits in there, ah, uhm, actually so into do that. Now I was thinking of either having them practice or enactment, now I was just worrying if you ever have in like, ah, practice with you, ah, some of those other strategies? 

00:49:55
DR. JON CARLSON Ah, okay. Ah, again something about practicing another strategies and I, what was it? 

00:50:00
 Well, maybe the enactment-- enacting so, ah, she practicing understanding him like in front of him, you know. 

00:50:05
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, yeah, you know, we, we could have practice that a lot more and we probably would have done that and you know, in the clinic office you know, would have practice, ah, seeing some more things like what could you say here, what could you say them but you know, just didn't go into that you know, here because you've got you know, few people watching and, ah, thought that this might be more interesting too. Ah, this-- its going, going some more insight. That's good, thanks for pointing that out and you know, that would really be more in mind with the fourth stage, you know, and, and that where you really moving to action. Yeah, good question. 

00:50:50
 I have fri-- some friends who have a wonderful marriage and their homicidal in the car so what, what they have decided is she-- when she drives he sits in the backseat and whe he drives she seats in the backseat and it works for them. 

00:51:05
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:51:10
TED That is the excellent suggestion, thanks. 

00:51:10
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, yeah, there's another idea. Yeah, you know, and this is one of the reasons I go to Thailand every year and, and I do this live, ah, demonstrations with people with every kinds of problems you could imagine and, uhm, work with the translator in live in front of a group and the Thai people there's always someone raises their hand and says, "why do you go behind doors in America? Why can't you do this in, in front of a group and everybody else could learn and everybody else could offer of help," and we've gotten so much help you know, already from the, the audience here which is some great insights to make this even better and we all care about one another that we somehow brought end to this privacy thing and, ah, like no one else says the same problems you know, like we can't care for one another but, yeah, anyway. I have fun question here. You, you guys holding up okay, yeah? You're holding up okay, yeah? 

00:52:10
TED Yeah. 

00:52:10
DR. JON CARLSON Good, okay. Ah, we need the power. 

00:52:15
 Ah, uhm, I'm interested that you, uhm... 

00:52:20
DR. JON CARLSON Oh, okay. 

00:52:20
 As its a couple session but I mean just that you complimented the lady and its just an interesting prospective for me to be complimenting one of the individuals more. 

00:52:35
DR. JON CARLSON Okay, I mean you know, maybe, yeah. Ah, ah, I wasn't aware of that and if I was doing that and, ah, so be it. Yeah, I mean it. I mean, I, I don't-- I, I din't do it intentionally. 

00:52:50
 Right. 

00:52:50
DR. JON CARLSON It is-- 

00:52:50
 And I'm interested as well in times of the strength aspects, in terms of, obviously, he'd fell down, down the line but I'm interested in the theme of intimacy and would that be something that could be explored in terms of how power and strength and what you know, I'm just interested of way you can go with that and also the context of a couple in terms of intimacy. 

00:53:15
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, and, and, and first we would wanna find out if they really want to mess with their intimacy I think therapist can do a lot of damage of the-- you know, projecting our own definitions of intimacy on to someone else's life and you know, they both indicated that that was something that they were really comfortable with, ah, they just little too tired you know, it sounds like all of us, doesn't it? And, ah, and, and that they both had some times where they express to me that, ah, when they do take the time to be with one another its pretty good and, ah, I'm just gonna let that go you know, and unless it would be something that they would want to go. I think we could all be more intimate but then what is that mean? Yeah, we have time for one more question. We have you know, one more right here in the hall. 

00:54:05
 Oh, thank you. I was reflecting on, ah, discussion that I heard this morning, uhm, Dr. Dietz and Dr. Shapiro and one other therapist you were talking about expectation. 

00:54:15
DR. JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:54:20
 And expectation of healing of what it is that's healing and, ah, Dr. Dickson talked about in different countries you know, might be voodoo or it might be you know, but if you really believe it works it can work and I'm listening to her and I keep hearing him say, "but you need to rest, you needs to rest," I think it wouldn't harm her to rest. 

00:54:45
DR. JON CARLSON Uhm-mm, yeah. 

00:54:45
 And I don't think he hears her say that so would you bring up something that fundamental? 

00:54:50
DR. JON CARLSON Yeah, sure. I think I unfortunately you weren't hear but I did that already. I did it in the hall but I just stumble on and stumble into but, but I talked about that, about how that wasn't loving behavior for her and as pretty much what we followed upon here that, ah, that he, he, he like a lot of us and she like a lot of us do a lot of loving behaviors that aren't taken in as loving by the other person and he's showing care and concern and hers is motivating him to be, to be stronger and as just, ah, what the-- they really have to start to give the other person what they want, you know, and so, yeah. And I think they got their message. Did you get that message? 

00:55:40
TED I definitely understand, yeah. 

00:55:45
FARRAH I did, thank you.
