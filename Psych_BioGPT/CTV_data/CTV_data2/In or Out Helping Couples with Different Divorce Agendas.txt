RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name's Rich Simon, I'm editor of "Psychotherapy Networker" and your host for this series called "Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy?" So, in, in, this series we're looking at a number of the challenging issues of working with couples. Many people believe that couples therapy may well be the most challenging mode of therapy and there are any number of issues that are challenging in a way that, typically, uh, at least traditional individual therapy does not challenge the therapist and the therapist craft in quite the same way, and, uh, today, we're gonna be looking at, uh, an issue what, like some others in this series, is, uh, perhaps too often unacknowledged, and the question is, when a couple comes into couples therapy, are, are, they really there for couples therapy? We really have two customers. So, to address that issue, what you might do about it, we have, uh, what, what, Networker webcast series would be complete without our friend, Bill Doherty. Bill, come in from, Lake, Lake Woebegone. How are you? 

00:01:20
BILL DOHERTY Okay. Good to see you Rich. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON So Bill, you have an article, in, in, uh, the November issue of "The Networker" called, um, "In-In-Out", where you're, uh, where, you're, you're, talking about the, uh, the challenge of treating the mixed agenda couple. What is a mixed agenda couple? 

00:01:45
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, well, it's the, um, the couple who has had no name before in our work, and, that, that, is where, uh, one person is leaning out of the relationship pretty strongly and the other person really wants to preserve it, and the reason I say that we haven't named them before is that, um, uh, it's not very prominent in our teaching and our models of therapy. Um, uh, you know, the assumption in most of the writing and the training about couples therapy is that, uh, that when they come in the door, although they may have many forms of ambivalence, they're not ambivalent about whether to come back the next time. 

00:02:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:02:20
BILL DOHERTY Ya know? The assumption is, that, that, neither of them has their, uh, divorce lawyer on speed dial and that they're going to come back, uh, and then, of course, the challenge is how do you actually work with them, but, but, this is a very common presentation. I estimate, and one study, uh, backs me up on it, that at least 30 percent of the couples coming in the door, uh, at least one of them, isn't so sure, not only that they wanna be in that marriage or the relationship, they're not sure they wanna have a relationship with you as the therapist. 

00:02:55
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:02:55
BILL DOHERTY And so, uh, it's a very common and frustrating scenario for therapists that's not had a name before, and a, and a, kind of, body of work around it. 

00:03:10
RICH SIMON So, perhaps, and we know that the, uh, outcome, uh, statistics on couples therapy, are, are, not terribly encouraging or they don't, they, compare unfavorably with individual work that perhaps there's some unspecified amount of the, co-, population that are not really customers for couples therapy, that's part of the reason. 

00:03:30
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, well actually, those outcome studies you're talking about, uh, eliminate the couples I'm talking about from their sample. 

00:03:35
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:03:40
BILL DOHERTY Okay? Um, uh, so if they were in there the outcomes would be even worse I think, okay? 

00:03:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:03:45
BILL DOHERTY Because, if, if, you're doing a study, ya know, it's gonna cost you a lot of money and yet, you wanna try, you wanna, uh, demonstrate that your model works, you, you, screen out people, uh, who are mixed agendas where somebody is very ambivalent about whether they wanna stay another week or two and ambivalent about whether to try to improve the relationship. So, if you're talking about the outcome studies, whoa, ya know, uh, I think it'd be even worse, if, if, these are in them, and one of the reasons why we don't have enough, kind of, guidance about this is that those studies, um, eliminate them. It's, kinda, ya know, it's always the problem with, uh, with clinical trials, ya know, the, the, the alcoholism clinical trials weed out people with depression and alcoholism, okay? The depression ones eliminate the alcoholic depressives and so, in the real world, people come in with all this complexity that doesn't often show up, in, in, our evidence-based, uh, clinical trials. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So, in this, in your piece, one of, towards the beginning of the piece you talk about three common mistakes, uh, and I guess these mistakes assume, and you'll correct me if I'm, uh, wrong here, assume that the therapist is even aware that you have a leaning in, as you refer to, and a leaning in and a leaning out partner, but you, uh, that there are three classic mistakes, in your view, of, of, handling this situation. So, talk with me a bit about that. 

00:05:05
BILL DOHERTY Well, I, I, why don't I add a fourth Rich, ya know, so people can get something even beyond what they read in the magazine? 

00:05:15
RICH SIMON A, a, bonus. Okay. 

00:05:15
BILL DOHERTY A bonus, right. Like, because, actually, uh, what, you, you, said in the setup for this, um, uh, uh, you know, encourages me to say that, some, some, therapists don't find out that somebody, that, they're mixed agenda until, like, the end of the session, ya know? 

00:05:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:05:30
BILL DOHERTY When, uh, you, you've, gotten out of people that, uh, somebody is much more unhappy than the other and is pessimistic, then you pull out your book to reschedule and somebody says, "well, I just came in once." Uh, and you go, "Oh. Okay." Um, uh, so, so, the, kind of, real basic mistake is to not find out, uh, where people's commitment are, not only to the relationship but to the process of working on it. Okay? So, that's sort of, really, basic mistake number one. 

00:06:05
RICH SIMON So, but, but, but, then again, you can extend that. You might not, uh, uh, it might take you a good deal longer than the first session. It seemed to me that was the point of your piece, is that you might, uh, have an extended period of time where things don't seem to be moving in the couples therapy and you discover it after, uh, any number of sessions that, really, somebody was just there along for the ride and didn't have any real investment, in, in, working as a couple. 

00:06:35
BILL DOHERTY Yeah. So, you, you, somebody might, uh, kind of, fool you for themselves at the beginning, by saying I really wanna try. 

00:06:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:06:40
BILL DOHERTY And then, you find out after a while they're really not invested in the therapy and so, uh, (crosstalk) what I'm gonna talk about later, what I call discernment counseling, can actually start at the beginning or it can start later on when you find out somebody's really not in it. 

00:06:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:55
BILL DOHERTY Uh, but, that, that, kind of, preliminary mistake is to not ask in the first session, uh, whether each person, uh, is invested or their level of investment and commitment to working on the problems in the marriage, in order to try to solve themâ€¦ 

00:07:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:20
BILL DOHERTY Okay? Um, and, uh, so that's the key, that's the key commitment to the therapeutic process issue. 'Kay? 

00:07:25
RICH SIMON And how do you get that information, uh, how, how, do you, just, how do you actually ask that question, what is, what are the various ways in which you try to get that information the first session? 

00:07:40
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, well, sometimes people will tell you right away. I mean, my, my, opening question, in the first, uh, session in couple's therapy is "What do you hope to get out of our work together?" And, uh, sometimes somebody will tell you there, right then, I really wanna save this marriage, I, ya know, an-, and I'm here to do that, maybe, sometimes both people will tell ou that and then, at some point, I will note that. That, that, that, investment is there. Uh, sometimes somebody will tell you right way I'm not sure, ya know, I even wanna try, I, talking to a lawyer uh, that's clear. In the middle, where you're not getting clarity, about their commitment to the relationship and to, the, the, wa-, the working on the relationship, then I ask, and I ask in words similar to what I used before, something like, ya know, "At this point, um, where do you see your, uh, uh, willingness to put, uh, time and effort in therapy, into solving the problems that you've been describing? (crosstalk) Something like that. Okay? Um, uh, so, it's the, it's the, uh, how, how, how, strongly are you committed to working on it? If that's not clear to me Within the, uh, first 15 minutes, I ask. 

00:08:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:09:00
BILL DOHERTY 'Kay? And, uh, all ofwhat we do in couples, ther-, all what we learn, in, ou-, our, training and in our models, w-, takes off from both people saying I'dlike to, at least, try. 

00:09:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. Right. 

00:09:15
BILL DOHERTY Poom, now you put in your cartridge for your EFT or your cognitive behavior, your psychodynamic, (crosstalk) but if one of them is saying, "uhh, I'm so demoralized, I'm not so sure." Or, "I have this girlfriend who seems to be a better match for me thanâ€¦" you know, (crosstalk) or "We've grown so far apart I don't know if there's anything left, I don't even know it'd be worth trying." Those are things that people sayâ€¦ 

00:09:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:09:40
BILL DOHERTY â€¦that clue me that this is a, uh, pre-therapy couple. 

00:09:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:09:45
BILL DOHERTY K? 

00:09:45
RICH SIMON Pre-therapy, okay. 

00:09:45
BILL DOHERTY That, that, that, I should not start, uh, couples therapy, (crosstalk) um, and would be, kind of, like, um, uh, you know, a ph-, a physician, or, uh, uh, saying, uh, you know, uh, I'd like to send you to physical therapy and, the, the, the, and the patient says, "Ah, uh, you know, I'm not into that stuff." (crosstalk) You know, or, or, not into the medicine, ya know, and what they'll, they'll write you the prescription, the therapy, the medicine anyway. Well, what the heck, you know, then it's a check mark. So, um, so here are the mistakes then, when the therapist determines either (crosstalk) at the beginning or later, that, uh, that somebody, uh, is, uh, leaning out, uh, of the, both the marriage and out of working with you. K? In the therapy, and the other really wants to save it and is saying, "I'm here." Uh, and can you see how this is a setup, for, for, some real serious mistakes, uh, and, uh, and one of the mistakes is to, uh, side with the one who wants to save it, uh, and pursue the distance, pursue the one that's leaning out, Okay? So, uh, you know, uh, and the reason, you know, to doers, (ph) hey, I like, I'm trained in this stuff, I like, I like this work, you know, come on, give me a chance, right? 

00:11:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:11:10
BILL DOHERTY Um, and, um, uh, it, it, so, so, you, you start to try to persuade that person who is sitting there like this. Uh, th-, to work on it, ya know, so you start to say, "Well, do you see any of your own contributions that you might work on?" (crosstalk) I got some faults, everybody's got faults, okay, but, uh, given how bad this has gotten I don't think that, blah, blah, blah, or, or, some people do the, what I call, the Popeye defense, "I am what I am." 

00:11:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:11:40
BILL DOHERTY Okay. Uh, I'm a guy who, uh, ya know, I'm, I'm in my head, ya know, and, uh, I don't do this. She wants things I can't give her. It's a... or, or, she won't give me what I want, ya know, um, I want an active sexual relationship and, uh, she, ya know, she's, she's somewhere else, ya know, um, and, uh, and so then I say, "Well, do you think it's possible that things could change?" (crosstalk) Uh, we've had some therapy before, ya know, and then I say, "Well who have you seen?" and, you know, and I'm suggesting not as good as me, and meanwhile, I'm there, ya know, I'm pushin', I'm sellin', I'm doing all this stuff and this person is, kind of, you know, is, is, fending me off, is fending me off, and we get into, uh, the classic, yes, but, yes, but, yes, but, yes, but, conversation, okay, um, an-, and meanwhile, the one who wants to save it is sitting there, uh, having the moral high ground, because, after all, they wanna keep the family together. 

00:12:35
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:12:40
BILL DOHERTY Uh, and, um, and then I start to get frustrated, with this, with this, person, K, and so, that's, that's the classic, uh, mistake of pursuing the distance. It hasn't worked for the wife for the last 25 years, hey, why don't I try it, K? 

00:12:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:12:50
BILL DOHERTY Uh, and I get annoyed at this person, um, and, um, and then maybe at the end, he agrees to reschedule or not but, I'm, I'm, frustrated and, they, they, probably don't come back. Um, and then afterwards, of course, I blame him. 

00:13:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:10
BILL DOHERTY Right, and when I talk about it in case consultation, everyone says, well, you know, you can't force people, you can't, you know, he wasn't a customer, ya know, he never was a customer, it's not your fault, um, and, uh, uh, and, and, so, Chris, that's really, a lot of times, what we do is, w-, we, blame the client, (crosstalk) and so, uh, so that's mistake number one. Uh, misnake, mistake number two is, uh, to, uh, hold back and, uh, and, and, really say, well, uh, ya know, you both have to, you know, be together on trying or I can't do anything for you, ya know, this is couples therapy. Both people have to be at a place where they wanna try it, and I'm not hearing that both of you are really onboard, and so I turn to her and I say, â€œI'm hearing, uh, Joe, uh, say he is not really, uh, that interested in working on the relationship, uh, and um, how do you feel about that?" Well she's upset about that and have you been able to persuade him, no, well, and Joe, I hear you saying, eh, eh, you're just, uh, not in a place right now where, you, you feel like an effort would be worthwhile? See, I'm, I'm, held back now, all right? At least the other one I'm in there, right? Um, but this one, I'm held back, uh, and, um, and in this case, the, the, uh, the one who wants to save it, the leaning in spouse, is feeling more and more demoralized because, uh, I'm, I'm, not putting any energy in. I'm not offering hope. I'm just, I'm treating them like this is, uh, you know, uh, th-, these are two customers, I need two votes, two yes' for me to give you my stuff. (crosstalk) There's only, one, one, yes. Ya know, and, uh, an-, and in the article, I, I, ya know, I describe a, ya know, a case, in, in, ya know, in, earlier in my career where, ya know, that's how I handled it, ya know. I just said, ya know, you, I, I, need, I can do divorce counseling, I can do marriage counseling, uh, I, I, need you to let me know. (crosstalk) And the wife in that case was very ambivalent, husband wanted to save it, and so I said, uh, ya know, think it over, ya know, let me know. I, it's sorta, I got medicine A or medicine B, you gotta, you gotta tell me, and meanwhile, wasn't actually offering her much help, in, in, in, making that decision. Ya know, uh, it was a binary, ya, you know, yes or no, you wanna, you wanna do this, and, uh, you know, husband called back and said she didn't wanna come back and he felt upset about that, ya know, and, so, that, that, I think that was a mistake. So, mistake number two is, ya have, ya have this demoralized couple coming in and you don't inject hope, and, and, and ya just, sort of, treat them, like, like, like they're customers. Um, and then mistake number three is that you, um, you, you, try to, uh, start the couples therapy, both of them together, ya try to do, you try to just get in there and do it and, in fact, uh, um, I, I've, read some, uh, i-,i-, i-, the rare times, when in, books and articles about, uh, evidence based couples therapy that this topic even comes up, uh, uh, what the writers often say is "Well, this is hard, cuz, you know, you don't have both people onboard, but what you can try is to start your therapy with both of them there and try to get into the issues, uh, and, uh, and, and, maybe, maybe, the one who is leaning out will say, "Hey, this is pretty good." And that works just often enough to, kind of, lure you into thinking that's the best way to do it, but what often happens is you have one person who is willing to be vulnerable, the, the, one who wants to save it, okay, uh, so in the examples I'm giving, ya know, let's say the wife wants to save it, so she's there, she's showing emotion, she's crying, she's trying to be vulnerable, she's saying I'll do my part, I know I have messed up, and, and, he is being not there. He's being invulnerable. (crosstalk) K? Uh, and, and so, y-, ya have, um, you don't get stuff outta him at that point, uh, cuz, she, she's, startin' to fall apart, and he's not gonna tell you, uh, uh, all that's on his mind, cuz, he's, he's close-up, and she's afraid that if she shows any anger at him for sitting there acting like it's all her fault, okay, if she gets really authentic with her, m-, harder feelings, uh, then she's afraid to drive him away, which really could happen. okay? So the marriage is hanging on a thread and you're doing a therapy that's suggesting people get really honest here folks. Let's get really into it, okay, say what's on your mind. Only one person is willing to say what's on their mind, uh, but they're taking too big a risk because they are the one who wants to save it and the other person's not the same. (ph) So, it, it, tends not to work, now, one of the things, I, I, I, say in the article is that, ya know, it isn't, it's not for me to say that nobody could ever pull this off, and I, and I, talked to a colleague, who, who, does this, (crosstalk) he's very experienced, it's a high wire act, to hold all of that together, okay? (crosstalk) And, um, and I used to do it, I used to try it, and, y-, but, it's too risky. It's too risky, too many things can go wrong. Uh, and so, that's why, I, I, I, do an alternative that we can get into but those are the three mistakes, pursuing the distance, siding with the distance, or just, sort of, charging ahead and trying to work with them together when there's too much risk involved in that process. 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON So, before we move to talking about, uh, what you call this sermon counseling, uh, just, wh-, one last point. So, it's clear in the pursuing, uh, the distance, you're reaching out, your, your, the classic mistake, I guess, there, is trying too hard when siding, what you say is, siding with the distancer, waiting for the two customers to sign the contract for couples therapy, then you're not invested in the (crosstalk) therapy as the therapist and you're, sort of, on the sidelines and maybe you're shortchanging, at least one of the partners, in terms of an investment, and then, this third alternative, is it, you know, the third posits, (ph)walking on egg shells or what's the stance? What's problematic, other than the fact that, it, it's, confusing for anyone, what's the, um, what, sort of, the energetic, what's the body language of the therapist? What's the position? What's the role that you are placed in, that you find problematic from viewpoint of the therapist? 

00:19:55
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, the, the, the problem for the therapist is that you're doing your work, so, ya know, you're in there but you don't have two customers for it, (crosstalk) and because you have somebody, who is, who is, willing to invest and be, and take risks and somebody who may not be, um, uh, it, it, it creates an imbalance of vulnerability. Now, for, if you're seeing an individual who is not so sure they wanna try therapy, wh-, it, that, that's a whole different thing. You say, okay, I get your mbivalence, tell me more of your ambivalence, do you wanna, you know, do you wanna, me-, meet again, and you can just, sorta, gently work with them and kind of, you know, like a lot of adolescent therapy is that way, you know, they don't wanna be there and you, sorta, gradually, they move from I don't wanna be here to, well, maybe it couldn't hurt, to, I can't wait â€˜til I come back. Okay? So, so, individual therapy, you, you, can use all of your skills with that individual while they're ambivalent. 

00:20:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:00
BILL DOHERTY With couples therapy, the problem is, if somebody's ambivalent, uh, very ambivalent about being there and the other person is wants, t-, either trying to be fully there, you have an asymmetry, an imbalance, of, of, of, vulnerability. You have an imbalance of self-disclosure. So, for example, the, um, the, uh, maybe the husband is, uh, who's, ha-, ha-, who is having an emotional affair, ya know, there's a woman he's infatuated with, maybe they haven't had sex, and, and, the sexual relationship in the marriage hasn't been that good, and in his mind, he has told himself that he no longer is attracted to his wife. He's no longer, um, interested in her romantically and sexually, um, and, um, but he's not told her that. Eh, he probably won't tell that, her, that in this session. I mean, his, his, he doesn't know that this therapy is gonna be helpful at all. He's gotta get that out somehow so that I can work with him on that but if he says that, to her, uh, wi-, with, her there, uh, this may be very hurtful to her. Particularly because he's not gonna be, maybe, that open about himself, okay, uh, and she's not gonna be able to come back with something equally powerful because, sh-, he's just hanging on and she's hanging on to him and she's afraid to drive him further away. K, so, you don't get, you don't get, enough juice in the room, (crosstalk) um, by, by, keeping them there together, and, it, it, it, creates an imbalance, and, and, it's really too risky for that person who wants to save it. 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON So, it's, it's, the two things that come across, is, is, on the one, there's a, kind of, obliviousness as part of the occupational hazard or the stance of the therapist, under those circumstances, your proceeding as if certain things are in effect, and they're not, and the other, at some point, you begin to feel yourself, you're walking on eggshells, you become protective, you, you, feel like there's, uh, there's a precariousness to what you're saying or doing and you may not be able to articulate it to yourself, but it's not productive and, it's, it's, not a good therapeutic stance, uh, to work out of. 

00:23:20
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, and, and, also, the other thing that happens Rich, is that when you, when you see them both together, and, and, you're all calling it couples therapy, then the one leaning out, pronounces you a failure after a session or two. 

00:23:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Correct. 

00:23:40
BILL DOHERTY Okay? This isn't getting us anywhere. 

00:23:40
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:23:40
BILL DOHERTY We're not, you know, we're not getting anywhere, you know, this (crosstalk) isn't helping, and you want to say, â€œIt's not, we're not helping because you haven't signed up, you jerk." (crosstalk) Okay, but you can't say that, uh, you know, so you say it indirectly, but, but, somebody who isn't trying is in a judgmental position, and often they are with their spouse, okay? So, they're in a judgmental position with their spouse cuz they're saying this marriage isn't working and blah, blah, blah, and then they're in the same position with you, K? 

00:24:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:24:10
BILL DOHERTY Uh, and then they declare it a failure, and, and, it plays into, the, the, the, secret goal of some people, to check off tried couples therapy, (crosstalk) okay? Because in the public face of the divorce, people say, did you try counseling, right? Oh yeah, we went to a really good person and it just didn't help. We were too far gone. 

00:24:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:24:35
BILL DOHERTY Okay! So, that's the other thing, you end up with these, a-, aborted, uh, therapy, uh, uh, relationships because somebody didn't really sign up. 

00:24:45
RICH SIMON Okay. All right, so let's move into, so, you have, over the years, through, ya know, some bitter experience that you'd describe, uh, very candidly, and, I, I, must say, I, engagingly, in, in, the piece and you developed something that you call "discernment counseling", and so, tell us about that. What's the alternative to these three classic, uh, mistakes? 

00:25:05
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, well, I, I, wanna give, um, some credit to, uh, Betty Carter, the wonderful family therapist, uh, and I feel like saying, as like authors do, uh, give her credit for some great ideas, and if I distorted them, it's my fault, not hers, Okay, so, cuz, I, I, never got back to her to say this is what I've done with it, so, hopefully, she would be pleased. Um, but, um, uh, it was a workshop, you know, in the '90s, uh, where, uh, Betty Carter talked about how she works with these couples who, I'm now calling mixed agenda couples, um, in a way in which, uh, she, uh, says to them, I'm gonna help each of you, uh, w-, with, your goals, even though right now they may not be, th-, the same goal. I'm gonna help, uh, uh, one of you, I would say the leaning out person, uh, make a decision about whether to try, uh, to save the relationship and invest in that, um, and for the other one, I'm gonna try to help you save it. So, for one I'm gonna help you decide whether you wanna be married, and the other, I'm gonna, uh, help you save it, the marriage, okay, and, um, and then a procedure that I'll be describing, you know, my adaptation of it, in which the, you, you, see them together and separately, um, uh, and, and, but, uh, if it wasn't, a, a, a, master, senior, uh, family therapist who I admired so much, who gave me permission, uh, to tell two people I'm gonna help each of you with your agendas even though they may be miles apart. 

00:26:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:26:40
BILL DOHERTY Very open about it, and so I started to try it and people bought it okay, and, they, they, you know, it's just like, oh, I could, I, I, could do that. It would be like watching a master surgeon, you know, do some sort of incision somewhere or cut some, you can do that? Ya know, people don't die, ya know? So then, I, I, I, started to do that in my practice. So I've been doing, um, uh, uh, some form of this for probably 15 or 18 years but I didn't have a name for it, and in recent years, as I begin, begun, to teach it to other people and I've formed a larger project, I, I, realize I need a name for this and then, a, a, protocol around it, an-, and, a way to crystalize it. So, that, that's, the sort of backdrop. Um, a big thing here, is, is, calling this discernment counseling and not marital therapy or couples therapy. In other words, I only do couples therapy if, uh, if both people decide they want to do couples therapy. Prior to that, we're doing something else that I now call discernment counseling. Um, and the goal of discernment counseling is clarity and confidence about a direction that they're gonna go in, K, and that direction might be towards divorce, uh, and it really only takes one person to decide, that's, that's, where I'm going, okay, uh, and, then, then, uh, uh, and then, how can they constructively move towards that, or, uh, a path could be towards, uh, a, uh, a period of six months of an all-out effort, with help, to see if they could put the marriage into, a, a, place where they would, uh, feel hopeful, uh, that they could be married for, uh, stay married for life. In other words, um, uh, the decision is not whether to stay married forever or not, the decision is whether to divorce or to do a six months of reconciliation effort, in therapy and, what I do now is we have a larger plant. It may mean, ya know, you go back to AA, it may mean you, you know, you go back on your meds, or, any number of things, uh, and so this process that is from one to five sessions, discernment counseling, no longer than five sessions because it's just gonna start to be therapy, ya know, if you just go on forever. Um, a process in which, um, the goal, is, is, a decision about the future. The advantage of not calling it couples therapy is that the one leaning out cannot pronounce the couples therapy a failure. 

00:29:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:25
BILL DOHERTY K, because we haven't tried it, and I do not ask anybody to take major risks when, the-, they're, both in the room at the same time. In discernment counseling, the, the hard work goes on individually. So, here's, here's, the format and this is the exact format I learned from, Betty, Betty Carter. Um, and this would, by the way, would start in the second session of therapy. You-, you-, you-, your second session with me cuz, ya know, the first session you're finding out the lay of the land. In the second session, uh, they come in, you do a brief check in, uh, any, any, highs or lows, or anything I need to hear about what's happened, you know, in, in, the last week. (crosstalk) Uh, and then, um, I spend, um, next part of the session, w-, usually with the leaning out person, the next part with the leaning in person and then a brief wrap up at the end. So, individually, I am helping each of them with their own agenda. So, the leaning out person, I get more of the story, the often don't tell the whole story when they are, uh, in the first session together with their spouse. So the guy who says, â€œI don't have any desire for her, ya know, I mean, she's a lovely person and, I, you know, but I just don't feel any passion, I don't, I don't know how I can stay married. Um, you know, she, I can't love her the way she wants to be loved." Uh, and, uh, ya know, and then maybe he says stuff he wouldn't say in front of her, ya know, she's put on some weight and blah, blah, blah, and she got so into the kids, and, and, so he's giving me this stuff, okay, um, and, I can ask him, again with her not there, uh, whether, ya know, whether there's some other women or particular woman that he's comparing her to or thinking about and then he says, "Well, you knowâ€¦" So he starts to tell me, uh, about, um, this good friend at work, ya know, â€œNothing's happened, we haven't, ta-â€¦" Ya know, blah, blah, blah, y'know, and, um, and so, I'm, I'm starting to unpack this, or I ask him about what else is going on in his life and in the scenario I'm giving you as my example, it's not uncommon that this guy is having some kind of mid-life crisis, ya know, he's, ya know, what stuff is going on in his life and, uh, and he's pulled back sexually, he hasn't been investing much in the marriage, there's some other women that he's attracted to. So all this stuff is coming out and, um, and so I can help him, m-, make a connection between these other experiences in his life, his, his, this other, kind of, fantasy relationship. I ask, I find out about how much he has been actually putting into the marriage, in recent years, probably not that much, and so I can help him have a bigger story, a more complex narrative to understand why he's on the brink of divorce, because what he's giving me is, uh, I'm just out of love. 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON So, now, uh, okay, now, but what if it's, these, it's not fantasy women? There's an undisclosed affairâ€¦ 

00:32:40
BILL DOHERTY Right, right. 

00:32:45
RICH SIMON â€¦that's coming out, in your, in this, session with you, what's your understanding about confidentiality? What's your sense of your role in that scenario? 

00:32:50
BILL DOHERTY Well, the, the, the, nice thing about not doing couples therapy, but doing discernment counseling is that, um, that I'm not, eh, eh, I'm not in an ethically compromised situation. I can work with him around understanding, w-, the meaning of that affair in his lifeâ€¦ 

00:33:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:10
BILL DOHERTY â€¦uh, and, uh, and, um, and, and, and, help him make a decision, uh, about whether he's going to, uh, e-, end that, suspend that affair, uh, to work on his marriage or not. Okay? So, th-, one of my cases, actually, uh, you know, he, he, he, um, uh, in fact, this is a good example of how these things go. Um, the, um, uh, um, he had a drinking problem, which he admitted. Um, his wife, ya know, uh, uh, got, she blew up at him. Uh, at one point they had been, i-, i-, i-, in and out of arguing about this and other sorts of things, their sexual relationship had not been good for some time. Um, he was from Europe, uh, so she said, ya know, I want a divorce and she went to a divorce lawyer, so he goes back to Europe to visit family and then, uh, picks up, uh, a sexual relationship with an old flame. 

00:34:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:34:05
BILL DOHERTY K? Um, the wife sensed it, ya know, kind of, he didn't admit it but she sensed it, and the old flame is texting him all the time. 

00:34:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:34:15
BILL DOHERTY K? And the wife checks his texts, 'kay, so, uh, so, uh, uh, and, uh, and he's, uh, so, they, they, they, come in and he's mad at her and he's the one that's really thinking of ending it now. Um, uh, ya know, she was at first, now he is, uh, and, um, and so, w-, with, him, I helped him, uh, uh, understand the context of that. It, it, it, was actually one of those, uh, uh, re-, uh, revenge, you hurt me, I'm gonna hurt you, affairs, okay, ya know, you threatened to throw me out of your wife, I'll go over there and, I'll, I'll, doâ€¦ so, helped him, uh, understand the affair (crosstalk) in a more complex way. Okay? Uh, and, um, and then, uh, and, and, and this happened over a couple sessions. Um, he said, ya know, i-, it, helped him see, realistically, he was not ever gonna get together with that woman in Europe. I mean, that, that, it was, it was, a fling, and it, it, it, wasn't a future relationship, and, uh, he got more in touch with how he did love his wife, and, and, well, but I could go on several sessions with, in my individual conversations with him, talking about that affair and the continual texting and that kind of thing, um, without having, t-, for him to disclose it to his wife, in a way that I couldn't in couples therapy because I was working with her simultaneously, and by the way, she, she, knew. She knew. Um, which I neither, confirmed, or denied, as they say, but I didn't, ya know. Um, w-, w-, working with her around what she wanted, which was to save the marriage, uh, and whether, uh, if in fact he had this affair, she thought she could, uh, forgive him for that. Uh, and, um, but I didn't, see, what I wouldn't do, the ethical compromise as a couples therapist would be to bring them together in the same room to work on their problems with that secret being there. But, in theâ€¦ 

00:36:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) That's something that you wouldn't cuz there's some, in this series, we'll be exploring some of, uh, that as a stance and a decision for therapists. In your approach with couples, that's not a position that you put yourself in? 

00:36:30
BILL DOHERTY That's right. I won't hold a secret. 

00:36:30
RICH SIMON I see. 

00:36:35
BILL DOHERTY Okay? Uh, I won't,that, I realize not everybody views it there (ph) but I don't wanna be the secret bearer, uh, when, uh, if she were to say to him, in the couples, ther-, couples therapy, are you having an affair and he said no and I know, it's, he's lying, uh, I'm a secret bearer, 'kay but in discernment counseling I'm not because at the end of this individual time, they each, they each, I decide with each of them what they're gonna summarize they took from the time working with me individually. (crosstalk) So, so, in other words, the, the, it's minimizing the intensity of the time the couple are in the room together. They're simply reporting. 

00:37:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:37:10
BILL DOHERTY And, and, I'm offering some perspectives, but I'm working with each of them separately, uh, on, first of all, a more complex understanding of what's going on, and their own contribution to it, and then a laser focus, not on changing the marriage now, but on do they want to invest in a six month all-out effort to change it. It's, it's, it's a focus on that, so part of the art of discernment counseling is you have to work with one hand tied behind your back. You, you, can't act, you can't go deeply into the problems because you don't have a contract for couples therapy. 

00:37:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Mm. 

00:37:55
BILL DOHERTY So, I'm, I'm, training some folks to do this now, and, and, a junior colleague, uh, I, I, realized I had to train, I had to teach her to be more, to be quicker and more intense, early on, cuz, you, you know, you don't know if they're ever gonna come back. You may have one or two shots at this, but to really get in there, uh, with each person about their own contributions to the problems, including the person who's leaning out. See, I can get in there, I hear their pain and all that (ph) and then, I can, I can, challenge them. If I challenge them with the spouse in the room they may distance, okay, but, but I can challenge them with the spouse out of the room. So, that colleague, I had to up her game to not be, kind of, empathic and hang in there like we have all the time in the world. Um, with my senior colleague, I had to teach him, not to, not to, do therapy. Not to, at the end of the session, have the wife turn to the husband and open up about how she was feeling and blah, blah, blah, because, uh, in fact, what happened was, he, he, uh, at one point she was expressing something at the end and he said, "Why don't you say that to your husband?" and I was like, uh oh, ya know, it was like, I could see a, I could see, I, I, I, could see a car crash, gon-, gonna, occur. Ya know, it was like, but, I could, I couldn't, stop it. Uh, because she said, "Heck no I'm not gonna say that to him." Well, it was too vulnerable at that moment. They, they, were too much on the brink, uh, to be able to sustain that kind of intensity. Uh, and, you know, we got passed it but, he, he, was a trained EFT therapist and he went right for the deeper affect without a contract to do the couples therapy. 

00:39:40
RICH SIMON Okay , so, let me just, uh, sorta, just summarize, and, and, let's, to give people an overview of this process, so, so, what I'm getting so far, is, uh, as, as, you said earlier, you're, you're, extending the narratives, you're, uh, exploring and getting people a fuller context for understanding how they might make a very important decision in their life. You're not, for the most part, doing what we think of as deep work with them, certainly not togetherâ€¦ (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
BILL DOHERTY (crosstalk) Not together. 

00:40:10
RICH SIMON You're surveying the territory Is there, uh, is there another important element to it? Does that capture it, is there something else that's about it that seems, uh, that we haven't discussed so far, about your protocol, your process? The challenging part seems to be, as you just mentioned, seems to be an important element there, that, you're, uh, you know, how, essentially, the question you address this in the article, well, in your next relationship, assuming that you're, you know, you haven't decided yet. How are you gonna keep yourself from, basically, getting it, you're getting yourself into the same pattern, that from my understanding, seems like a big piece of what your, of your, agenda, your protocol, is that correct? 

00:40:50
BILL DOHERTY Yes, that, one way to think of it is that you're helping each person take a differentiated stance in this crisis, and learn what they can learn from this. 

00:41:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:00
BILL DOHERTY Okay? What people are focused on, often is what the other person needs to learn, 'kay, what can I learn and again, whether or not you're going to divorce, or, or, onto the reconciliation period, and then some of the questions to get at that, one of them, are, would be, uh, what about yourself have you learned that you need to work on and change, in, you know, you've learned from this crisis and in this marriage, that you would have to work on in any relationship in the future, K, because people have relationships, specific, uh, explanations for their problem. I can't be assertive with Joe, he's just too, you know, he, he, he's just too opinionated and, blah, blah, blah. Do you think assertiveness might be a challenge for you in other relationships in the future? 'Kay, uh, yeah, I think so. Um, a-, a-, so, so, and that's again, taking a more differentiated, uh, uh, stance instead of saying, cuz what a lot of people say is, um, that, yeah, I, I'm, not perfect, ya, I've made my mistakes, but really, what it comes down to is that I've made understandable human mistakes, from, that come from living with an impossible person. 

00:42:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:42:20
BILL DOHERTY K? No, no, nobody's perfect. Well, that's not what I call a lot of learning, okay, and one of my goals is, even if people divorce, an, and a lot of the folks that we see do, I mean, they're, they're, kind of, you know, they're, they're, like in the intensive care unit, ya know, ya, I, I, I'd worry if all the marriages made it, ya know, I mean, it's just, we'd be too coercive, but, um, I really want people to learn, uh, more than, A. I chose the wrong person. B. For some strange, le-, reason, I fell out of love. Uh, and C. Uh, I've been as perfect as a human being could be given, uh, a difficult spouse. 

00:42:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:43:00
BILL DOHERTY K? Uh, um, and so, uh, a more complex understanding of self's contribution is a big part of it, now, and here's, ironically then, where the optimism about potentially working on it can be because the person, the one person I can work on is me. Okay? A lot of the fatalism that people have, where they're afraid to even try therapy, is from thinking, from convincing themselves, that their spouse can't change. Now, I wanna add something here that, we, part of what we do, uh, within, is, is, ask about the divorce narrative which happened that's gotten you to this point, and then we ask about the repair narrative. What have you tried individually, and, and, together to try to fix the problems before you got to, this, this, point, and, and, there, we learn about a lot of therapists out there. Uh, who, particularly individual therapists who somebody goes to, the therapist never having laid eyes on the spouse, develops a narrative, if you will, about the marital problems that, basically, says that the other person is impossible. The other person will never change, uh, and, and, and, then, then, analyzing them. I mean, we've had people, who, who, the therapist, uh, Xeroxed pages from the DSM, uh, you know, this is, take a look to see whether narcissistic personality disorder may fit your spouse, okay, and so you get what we call an undermining therapist out there. 

00:44:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:30
BILL DOHERTY Ah, who, um, uh, who, an-, an-, who, the, the client uses, the, the, terms, an-, that they've gotten from the therapist, and I don't think that often serves the client and it doesn't serve the marriage. 

00:44:45
RICH SIMON So, uh, pulling back for a second, so this is, eh, this is, essentially you're describing, and I'm sure there's more detail here, but you're describing this process. So you've been doing this for all these years, a-, what happens, what difference does this make then, in your own practice, and for that 30 percent, in, and maybe there's more, if 30 percent of the larger population had this kind of mixed agenda pattern, I would imagine you've talked about this, you've written a bit about this, more, perhaps a larger proportion of that comes to see you, so, wh-, if you were to, kind of, summarize the categories of, how this, what are the outcomes of this discernment counseling process, and give us some kind of profile of there, (ph) what would you say? 

00:45:30
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, I would say, um, in my private practice which is different from now doing a, sort of, specialty thing in this area, (crosstalk) but in my private practice, I, I, I, think that, um, uh, more than half, uh, of the people that I would do discernment counseling with would decide to start the therapy, K, uh, and the great majority of them, uh, have had successful outcomes in the sense that they, um, they stay together and, uh, improve their relationship, got it to, at least, a good enough stage. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:10
BILL DOHERTY Um, and that the big thing that this, uh, and I'd also say that most of the, uh, of the folks who did not go onto the therapy mode, um, uh, learned, uh, some important things that carried over to a better divorce. So, I would hear back from divorce lawyers and mediators that some of those couples that I sent to them really were ready to do a onstructive divorce. 

00:46:35
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:46:35
BILL DOHERTY Ya know, the-, they, they, uh, had been together in the room in a calm way, in which, and separately, ya know, together and separately, which, they, they, developed, a more, a common narrative, uh, that was complicated and that involved both people, uh, for, uh, the, the, uh, the, the, breakdown of the marriage, and, and, their divorce. Uh, not, not, so much feeling victimized or, ya know, so, uh, so, that's, that for me is also, uh, a positive outcome. It may not be, uh, (crosstalk) uh, ya know, sorta, number one vote, but it's a positive outcome. 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:15
BILL DOHERTY Um, and so, and so, and what this has done, Rich, for me, as a practitioner, is that I don't go, "Oh no, what am I gonna do with these people?" Because somebody's half out the door and the other is desperate. Uh, I, I, I, know, I, I, I, have a protocol, I have a plan. Okay, and things don't always work out the way I or others would want, I mean, life is complicated, I'm not a miracle worker but I'm on my game. I, I, I, know what to do here, and, and, that, the, the, people are often willing to slow down the, their, r-, out of control railroad, uh, uh, train, towards the divorce to slow it down, to take another look, and, and, it's a non-pressurized look, okay, because the clock is not ticking for therapy. It's, it's, ya know, it's, it's this, it's a time out, uh, for personal reflection, um, for not making things worse. One thing I did not mention, um, that, I, I, need to say is that, for the leaning in person, who we call the hopeful spouse, we use a lot of Michelle Weiner-Davis', uh, work on them, uh, not pursuing, not scolding, not criticizing, in other words, not doing all the things which they lose themselves in their boundaries and they make things worse. So, so, just as I'm trying to help the person leaning out make a differentiated decision based on some self-knowledge, uh, I'm trying to help the person who wants to save it, hold onto their boundaries, uh, use this as a wakeup call to, uh, work on aspects of self that, maybe, are long overdue, uh, and to neither pursue nor distance. 

00:48:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:00
BILL DOHERTY K? So, that person has a coherent way to proceed, instead of acting out of crisis, and if the other person decides, ultimately, divorce, that individual has often learned some important things and they don't feel like they're just a victim of the other person. So, so, it's a way to help both parties and the relationship with a plan, as opposed to, just like, oh, what do I, what do I do here, or, and I don't end up mad at somebody the way I would in the past, before, when somebody wouldn't really give the therapy a try, and then they'd pronounce it a failure. 

00:49:35
RICH SIMON So, uh, uh, so in this, so you say that you, uh, five sessions would be your limit, in most cases, in this kind of a process. What does it sound like in session five? So you've had these, kind of, conversations, and, and, I would imagine that session can be, ya know, heavy, and, and, really quite momentous, big decisions are being made, in, in, people, there's a lot of emotional weight there. Give us a little (ph) flavor for what's that session five, when you, when two people come to, this, the, end of this crisis, I, I, I, would imagine if they decide they're gonna work, wi-, together in therapy, I mean, that's, ya, you've said, that, but particularly what it sounds like where a decision has been made, uh, and how that decision is made, at least by one party, that they're not moving forward. Give us the flavor for that. 

00:50:25
BILL DOHERTY Yeah, for the not moving forward? 

00:50:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:25
BILL DOHERTY Uh, right. So, thatâ€¦ 

00:50:25
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) 

00:50:30
BILL DOHERTY â€¦So let me say the moving forward, y-, y-, you're, building up to that point and then in session five, or it could be four, um, you, you, they actually come together and we have a reconciliation plan, okay, that, that, may involve, as I said, like with this couple where the guy had the fling, in, in, Europe, she's history. Um, he's, he's, going to get an alcoholism assessment. She's going back to Al Anon. Ya know, I write all this stuff down. I mean, ya know, we talk about it, and we're going to do therapy together, for, for, six months, divorce off the table for that period of time. 

00:51:00
RICH SIMON Mm. Okay. 

00:51:00
BILL DOHERTY Okay, uh, and then you can put it back on the table. They sign it. I mean, so, in recent years I've gotten much more explicit, like, like, and so, next time folks, I'm your therapist. 

00:51:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:51:15
BILL DOHERTY Okay, and so, it's, it's, it's in, it's a shift, K, and they're usually pretty excited at that point. 

00:51:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:20
BILL DOHERTY In the, in the, other case, um, it's, it's, never a surprise, when somebody has decided I can't go on. We've been building up to that. Okay. It's just, it's just, been clear. It, it, it's, not final but it's been clear, uh, and, uh, and the other person, I've prepared them for this, okay, uh, because the person leaning out is, ya know, like, the guy who I helped him see the mid-life crisis aspect of the other woman in his life. Um, I helped him see that he had not really put energy into his marriage for, ya know, 15 years. I helped the wife see that she had not as well. It wasn't just a matter of, he, he, found another woman, that they had let their marriage, r-, really go, uh, and that he had entered a personal life crisis and found another woman, so, ya know, helped unpack all that and ultimately he decided to go with the other woman. 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:15
BILL DOHERTY K, uh, and it was hard. It was sad, um, the wife was not yelling and screaming at him. Uh, she felt she had given her best shot at this, uh, at making it work. He felt sad, uh, but, he, he, ultimately concluded he didn't have enough energy to try, that the therapy, if he tried it, would be so half-hearted, it wouldn't, it wouldn't, it wouldn't, do any good. Okay, so it was a sad, uh, ending, um, I, I, got an email back from, um, the, the, husband who said they, in the car on the way home, they had the most honest conversation they'd ever had in their 20 years. 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:50
BILL DOHERTY Um, so, and they decided to do a collaborative divorce with collaborative divorce lawyers. Okay, so, um, it, it, it, generally speaking, there's been enough learning that you don't have the same kind of, uh, you know, outrage and, ya know, why are you doing this to me, and that kind of thing at the end. 

00:53:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. So, and, s-, so, when you're, and when you're, uh, helping, as you mentioned earlier that you're doing some more trainings, that your younger and older colleagues are doing this kind of, uh, this kind of, y-, approach. What's, what's, the toughest thing for therapists to learn in this process, if they're gonna be, eff-, effective, doing what this process that you're describing? 

00:53:40
BILL DOHERTY Yeah. I think, it's, it's, learning the boundaries around this. Uh, learning what not to do. 

00:53:45
RICH SIMON What not to do. 

00:53:45
BILL DOHERTY What not to go into. Uh, so I had a colleague watch me in a session yesterday and that was one of her, and, and, she watched me in her first session, and, uh, and what she noted were the places where I would, uh, offer empathy, or, or, let somebody know I heard them on something, uh, but where I did not, I did not follow it up. Okay, or where I'll say, this is the kind of thing, this dynamic that you're now describing, uh, is the kind of thing that you could work on in therapy and is common for people to learn how to work on in therapy and do better with. So, that's an example but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna get into it now. The stuff I'm gonna get into now are the things that are, uh, uh, are the oversimplifications of their view of what's going on. The lack, of, of, self-understanding of their own contributions, um, um, uh, uh, lack of hope that's based on, I think, maybe some illusions how relationships are. That's the stuff I'm working on, where there's depth and intensity, but the couple dynamics, I'm not gonna try to change them now. 

00:54:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
BILL DOHERTY I'll be doing, like, if, if, you decide to work on reconciliation then this is a treatable problem. 

00:55:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:55:00
BILL DOHERTY If both of you want to. 

00:55:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:55:05
BILL DOHERTY But you notice that, that's, it's if. It's a subjunctive. 

00:55:05
RICH SIMON Yep, yep. 

00:55:10
BILL DOHERTY So, it's the boundaries and the focus on what you're doing now, cuz if you start to bleed into your therapist role, you're apt to get defeated then because you don't have two people ready to do it and then somebody pulls back and once they pull back you're dead, because, you, you, tried to be the therapist without permission to be the therapist, (crosstalk) and what are you going to do then? 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. So, there is, there is, a kind of thing, there's a kind of, um, uh, it begins, I guess, this way of thinking, it begins with, uh, a basic challenge to, uh, therapeutic hubris, (crosstalk) cuz we can think we're so, we can, fight force or personality by the power of the model, whatever it is, if people, what you were saying at the very beginning of the conversation, you know, if they get a little flavor for this. 

00:56:00
BILL DOHERTY Yeah. If you got to know me. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON They get to know me and the power of the kind of therapy experience that I can help create, uh, so, so, this, cuz this, um, I, I, guess the critique of this might be that this is, it's very reasonable, uh, but perhaps too reasonable, this process. That you're not giving enough of an opportunity for people to get exposed, to the, to the, process of therapy and the way in which people can begin to see new possibilities when, suddenly, they, uh, their inner child is allowed to speak in a couples therapy session. I, uh, or something like that. (crosstalk) I mean, is that something that, have you heard that, is that, in terms of a, people who, well, I'm not so sure this is for me or, I don't, I don't, buy this particular, uh, this, this, model, this idea, this pre-therapy protocol. 

00:56:50
BILL DOHERTY Not until you mentioned it right now Rich, and you're gonna be spreading that slander about this process (ph) all over the country. Uh, so, but, let me, let me, respond to the first ever critique on that regard. 

00:57:00
(inaudible ) 

00:57:05
BILL DOHERTY I could imagine some unreasonable person saying no. Um, the, um, the response I've been getting pretty universally is, uh, uh, oh, oh, my goodness, there's something I can do in this situation that is so darn frustrating. 

00:57:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:57:20
BILL DOHERTY Um, uh, and, and, the thing, that, that, uh, that, it, it, may be hard to convey when I'm talking about the boundaries is the intensity of the individual work. 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:35
BILL DOHERTY But, it's, it's, it's, bounded but intense, Okay, it's so I can really be challenging somebody quite seriously, like a guy who wasn't getting how arrogant and dismissive he was coming across to his wife, who was the one leaning out, and so I could say to him, in fact, with the hopeful spouse, I can be more blunt, and, and, more intensive, more up front and challenging then I normally could be as a therapist because I'm on his side. I mean, Joe, wants, wants, to save this marriage, and I'm saying, "Joe, would you like me to help you do that? I'd like you to help, I'd like to help you do that." That's say, (ph) that's what I learned from Betty Carter, I can, I'd like to help you save your marriage and you're being a jackass to her. (crosstalk) I'm not sure, if I was her, I'd wanna be with you. 

00:58:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:58:20
BILL DOHERTY Now, I mean, that's pretty, that's pretty, forceful, um, but I'm his coach, okay, uh, and I'm on his side and I'm not against her, uh, (crosstalk) and, so there's, so, this particular guy, ya know, he got it in a way he never had before, Okay. I'm not pussy footing around with him because I have an alliance and a common goal with him. So, so, it's not just cognitive, cerebral, sort of stuff by any means, but it's just when they're together in the roomâ€¦ 

00:58:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:58:50
BILL DOHERTY I'm not pushing for a lot of stuff here cuz it's premature. 

00:58:55
RICH SIMON So, uh, we just have a few minutes left and so, um, recently, just, eh, a couple days ago, had a conversations, we had Sue Johnson and Terry Real, this was part of our virtual conference and had, this, this, uh, dialogue and the issue that really came to is, um, the, the, basic notion of who I am, what's my role here in this process, um, and Sue, as you know, is, is, uh, very, as-, uh, her work is very steeped in attachment theory. She, her notion, is that, um, that, the, the, the, uh, interrelationship, this is a rupture in an attachment relationship and there are antecedents, uh, the intense antecedents in people's childhood experiences and so on, and partly what the therapist is, and, thi-, this is, this is her terms can be, uh, is an attachment figure for both of the, uh, partners in the couple, or can be. When I turn to Terry, say, "and Terry, are you a attachment figure in, uh, in, in, the kind of therapy you do with couples or are you a coach?" He's very, and he's very quick to respond, "I am a coach. I'm not an attachment figure." So, there's a, there's this co-question of what's the experience, what's our role, what's our connection with partners in the marriage. How do you, descri-, how do you come out on that spectrum, of, uh, of, understanding what, the, the, therapeutic stance is, and what is it that you're offering to, uh, to clients? 

01:00:35
BILL DOHERTY You asking me to take sides between Terry Real and Sue Johnson Rich? 

01:00:35
RICH SIMON I, well, I, I, provoked you a moment ago, and, and, was the first ever critic of your therapy model, now I'm trying to get you into more trouble. 

01:00:45
BILL DOHERTY Um, so, my, my, answer is, uh, both. 

01:00:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:00:50
BILL DOHERTY Yeah. Uhâ€¦(crosstalk) 

01:00:50
RICH SIMON Say a little about that. 

01:00:55
BILL DOHERTY Well, I think, I think, Sue is both, um, a coach and an attachment figure, I've seen her work. Um, I, I, for what I know of Terry, I think he's both. I think the problem we have in our field is that we disagree about the explanatory models. 

01:01:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:01:05
BILL DOHERTY More than we do about what really helps people. Uh, if you don't believe that coaches are attachment figures, why are students writing, at Penn State, about Joe Paterno being quiet? (ph) 

01:01:15
RICH SIMON Hadn't occurred to me, but yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yep, yep. 

01:01:20
BILL DOHERTY So that's my answer. 

01:01:25
RICH SIMON All right. Well, here, here, here, you have an insights, not only do you get insights into psychotherapy but insights into front page news, and, and, front page sports news. Bill, as always, uh, a great pleasure. The, um, wanna really encourage people to, um, give us your comments, uh, Bill, uh, I'm quite interested in them. Uh, I'm, uh, uh, this, this, is really, I think, the way we learn the conversation, is, this is a community learning process, to continue on the conversation. Uh, Bill has been, uh, very generous and, uh, responding where appropriate to comments, and, and, will, I'm sure, will look at whatever comments you put his way or questions, or (crosstalk) whatever, so whatever it is, your insights, your questions, your, if you wanna take some, a few more pokes at him on my behalf, feel free. In any case, that's, that's, all the time we have for right now. Again, thanks Bill. (crosstalk) Next week on this webcast, "Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy?"
