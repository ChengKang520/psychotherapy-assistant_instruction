STRESS 

00:00:05
MICHAEL AMORY Stress, just a word makes you tense and the feeling is even worse. 

00:00:10
Just kinda like the feeling like anxiousness or angry like… or depression like all at the same time and you real… really can’t do anything about it. 

00:00:20
So you can’t really process everything that's going on, just kind of an overload, I mean there is a smaller things just make it go off the edge. 

00:00:30
All the bad things are happened to you are just piling, piling up and you are holding that in until you can’t holding it in no more. 

00:00:40
And then it's really like have everything that piled up and then more people like okay, put more pressure on you like okay, you have to do this, you have to clean, you have to cook and you can do this. 

00:00:50
Whatever… 

00:00:50
Your stomach starts to hurt and you just wanna like curl up in the ball. 

00:00:55
It’s like the point right before you explodes like stress, something. 

00:00:55
And then you feel the feeling you know like oh I’m stressed out. 

00:01:00
Don’t STRESS OUT About it STRESS MANAGEMENT FOR TEENS 

00:01:05
MICHAEL AMORY Teens these days have plenty to stress out about. There are the little everyday hassles and then there are the big things. 

00:01:15
You know you're in violation of probation. 

00:01:15
You guys what're you doing here. 

00:01:20
Just home life, I mean negative… just the negative (inaudible ) is in the house when things are right like the yelling and like that, the arguing like goes on. 

00:01:25
I stress a lot about my physical appearance and how I look. I mean, I look at myself as things someone overweight, I just can’t be happy with who I’m and what my body is. 

00:01:40
When I’m alone, I just start thinking about all the bad things that are in the neighborhood. When you think about it, you know that there is something wrong with it that all these violence going on. 

00:01:55
To me the most stressful thing in my life has been you know my parents getting divorced and dealing with family issues… 

00:02:05
Oh, I fight with my mom a lot and that stresses me out a lot like when we're yelling at each other and everything. 

00:02:10
My mom is never there because she is single parent and she worked (inaudible ) My mom is never home. And when she is home she is already in sleep or something you know… 

00:02:20
From family to school, to your job, to you know just watch something on the TV, you know it doesn’t really matter. There is stress everywhere. 

00:02:30
MICHAEL AMORY Whatever the stress, most of us don’t do a very good job of dealing with it. When we don’t know how to deal the stress, things can definitely go from bad to worse. And we can find ourselves all kinds of problems. 

00:02:50
When I really didn’t know how to deal with stress, I guess, you could say um… you know I shut myself out a lot, didn’t really let myself get close to people and ah… you know I started turning the people that use drugs and you know that was basically what got me wound up in the system. 

00:03:10
Get out of my face. 

00:03:15
MICHAEL AMORY Mismanaging our anger is another way that stress can overwhelm us. 

00:03:20
Because when you've got, how the stuff dwelling inside you, all of a sudden just coming out. 

00:03:25
I’m just like rebellious and talking back… 

00:03:25
I just don’t want to hurt anyone. So, I just keep it inside. 

00:03:30
MICHAEL AMORY Stress can create physical problems like headache and neck and back pains. Depression and sleep problems are other ways that stress shows up in our lives. 

00:03:45
My mummy used to like do all these jobs and not like, I really… really… really stressful time in my life and that was like when my greater job and I remember like I didn’t get any sleep. I didn’t eats a lot, so I was like, I was really very skinny and I didn’t talk about anything that was going on that I was actually like extremely stressed out. 

00:04:05
What is STRESS? STRESS IS A RESPONSE TO THE DEMANDS PLACED ON US IN OUR LIVES The physiology of STRESS FIGHT OR FLIGHT SENSE ORGANS EYES EARS NOSE TASTE TOUCH 

00:04:05
MICHAEL AMORY What is this thing called stress? Stress is a response to the demands placed on us in our lives. These demands can be physical, emotional, mental or spiritual. The human stress response goes back to the cavemen when our ancestors were faced with danger they could either fight or flee. Either way, their bodies went through a serious of changes to prepare them to handle the problem. In the fight or flight response, the heartbeats faster to increase blood flow. Sugar and fats are released into the bloodstream for energy. Breathing rate increases for more oxygen, digesting ceases, muscles tense, perspiration increases and all the senses are heightened. In fact, the stress response is design to make us uncomfortable, so we do something to get us out of danger. This work pretty well for the dangers our ancestors faced, but it’s not too practical for today’s everyday hassles like taking test and getting stuck in traffic. Nevertheless, our bodies tend to respond to all challenges, physical or emotional, real or imagine, as though we still live in the jungle. 

00:05:25
What causes STRESS? 

00:05:30
…rebellion 

00:05:30
BODY MIND SPIRIT EMOTIONS 

00:05:30
MICHAEL AMORY When the demands of our lives get to be too much, and we don’t know how to deal with them, we get stressed out and then our bodies, our minds, our spirit, and our emotions are all affected. The demands in our lives can come from anywhere, home life… 

00:05:50
Oh, my parents arguing and me fighting with my parents. 

00:05:55
MICHAEL AMORY Our relationships… 

00:05:55
I always get rejected so, it makes me feel really bad. I get all stressed. 

00:06:00
MICHAEL AMORY … our neighborhoods… 

00:06:05
The guy (inaudible ) like two blocks from like from where I live and I was like oh, I was started crying about oh I know this guy… 

00:06:10
Open your book page seven… 

00:06:15
MICHAEL AMORY … school work… 

00:06:15
… you are going to pick up… 

00:06:15
MICHAEL AMORY … money or not having enough of it. Jobs, world events… 

00:06:25
I don't watch news anymore because like guys somehow, oh there is possible there, we can (inaudible ) you know as they are suppose to tell us, but I’m scared, I’m… anytime, I hear airplane any time I like, any time I just like hear about boom like I get scared. 

00:06:45
And I also the family and the friends involved in the war. It’s… it makes, it sort of scary to think that there is somebody you know out there who might die. 

00:06:55
My families are in Iraq, that's is really stressful everyday worrying about my family and whatever is happening down there and stuff. 

00:07:00
MICHAEL AMORY Even technology can produce stress. So, once we understand that the things in our lives can becomes stressful. It’s easy to see that stress isn’t something happening out there. It happens in here and how we respond to a what's happening. 

00:07:15
Probably the thing that fits almost all sources of stress for me is just kind of fear projection. 

00:07:20
If you give me two full sheets of paper… 

00:07:25
What is HEALTH? HEALTH IS BRINGING BALANCE TO OUR BODY, MIND, SPIRIT AND EMOTIONS 

00:07:25
MICHAEL AMORY So, let’s take a look at the opposite of being stressed out. In other words, what it feels like to be healthy? The key to being healthy is learning how to bring balance to our bodies, minds, spirit and emotions. So, the demands of our lives, don’t stresses out. These students are taking a class at their school called Health Quest. The purpose of the class is to learn healthy ways to bring balance physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually to their lives and manage their stress. 

00:08:00
LINDA BARTLETT HEALTH QUEST - Project Coordinator The purpose of today is first of all, introduce each other like who are you okay. Followed by a couple of questions on the back wall here what is stress to you and how do you know when you are stressed is one of the objectives of this course is to learn to listen to your own body, in your own mind, in your own heart, in your own spirit because we have warning signs, it says well, danger coming… 

00:08:20
MICHAEL AMORY The first thing they learned was the importance of recognizing what happens in our bodies, minds, spirits and emotions when the demands get to be too much and were starting to stress up. 

00:08:30
And I know that I’m stress because I can be really mean to people and I… act different. 

00:08:40
Um… I’m Lesley(ph) and… and my mom stresses me out like a lot and I know I’m stress because I progressed in it and really irritable and I eat a lot. 

00:08:50
MICHAEL AMORY If our stress level gets too high, eventually we snap. It can happen emotionally, mentally, spiritually or physically. 

00:09:05
STRESS and The Body HEADACHES STOMACH ACHES TIRED GETTING SICK COLD HANDS & FEET RELAXATION 

00:09:05
MICHAEL AMORY There are many different ways that too much stress shows up in our bodies including headache, stomachache, being tired, getting sick easier, cold hands and feet. Learning to relax is one of the most important things we can do for our physical health. Some good relaxation techniques for helping reduce physical symptoms of too much stress include, deep breathing… 

00:09:35
...comfortably deep. If your stomach rise up nice and slow, then come back, down again. 

00:09:40
When you're really mad and you know you just start breathing really shallowly and can’t think straight because you probably not getting enough oxygen. So, deep breathing helps really calm you down… 

00:09:50
MICHAEL AMORY Stretching… 

00:09:55
And the… I can actually like move my… I can rotate my shoulders right now, which I couldn’t do earlier this morning… 

00:10:00
At the top of the right below where the skull comes around there is a little dimple… 

00:10:05
MICHAEL AMORY Massage… 

00:10:05
There’s a little soft spot and you are going to the first spot is just in from the body part of the shoulder, make sure you are in the middy part here of the ridge of the shoulder here and you are just going to ease into that and she is going to tell me, good and then you hold backward. 

00:10:25
It feels good and it just makes it feel more relaxed and like easier to move like before I was little tender, now it just feels really good. 

00:10:35
DR. LARRY ECKSTEIN ,M.D. Okay so the idea would being centered is that you're actually putting your attention in a place in your body that happens to be your center of gravity. 

00:10:45
MICHAEL AMORY Learning how to center ourselves to training in martial arts is another good way to reduce stress. 

00:10:50
DR. LARRY ECKSTEIN …you know you’re your mind is being centered and I just gently nudge you can actually you know be thrown off balance. Okay but I want you to a little simple kind of thing which is bend your knees a little bit, think about your center, your place of center and take a breath and just let your body relax and sink into this kind of visualization of your center. And now if I gently nudge you you're gonna be much harder to push over. 

00:11:20
[sil.] 

00:11:30
DR. LARRY ECKSTEIN What I do with Aikido in stress is these same kind of principle centering yourself, emptying your mind by creating a flow into your center for relaxing, most of time people forget to breathe when they're under stress, their muscles are tight when they are under stress, see a lot of people say I hold my tension up to here, well relax, breathe, empty your mind. I mean anything you can apply for almost anything that happens in life. 

00:11:55
WHAT WE EAT 

00:11:55
MICHAEL AMORY What we eat really affects our bodies experienced stress and when we get stressed out, the food we often crave sugar, caffeine, junk food just makes things worse. Remember that one of our body's stress responses is to release sugar and fat into our blood stream, so adding more sugar and fat when your are under stress isn't too helpful. 

00:12:20
We can say except for having natural sugar or fruits who has had a sugar-free day… 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:35
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME So what I'm going to show you is a demonstration the average American eats about a 160 pounds of sugar a year. 

00:12:40
I'm setting my ways about sugar, started to add sugar since I was young like a lot same with the lot of people like their first candy bar and whatever and it just got me hugged. 

00:12:50
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME ,D.C. Can anyone just guess what percentage of Americans are obese yeah. 

00:12:55
About more than 3.4 

00:13:00
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME Where they claim it's more about like 35% so about a third, so as I look around this room that is not the case at all but you imagine that about one thirds of we just cut a line here and moved you over here that many Americans are obese with an… are obese within each group. Such a very high number and a lot of that has to do with what we eat. So it is clear how this stress our system, the food we put in, this is the chemical side of things is that make sense to people so I was reading here it says that over the course of the year one regular cola a day which is about 150 calories adds up to almost 50,000 calories or about 15 pounds. So, that is the potential you have to put on if you're not, if you're sedentary and don't do any physical activity and I stress with one… 

00:13:45
DRINKING WATER 

00:13:50
MICHAEL AMORY One simple way to be healthier is to drink more water. 

00:13:55
LINDA BARTLETT We talked to you about this as have a cold drinking water. 

00:13:55
MICHAEL AMORY In health quest getting into the habit of drinking more water was one of their first assignments. 

00:14:00
LINDA BARTLETT Get your hand on a bottle of water or… 

00:14:00
6-8 GLASSES A DAY 

00:14:05
MICHAEL AMORY At first most student weren't that into it, but as the weeks went by more and more the class get into drinking six to eight glasses of water a day. 

00:14:15
LINDA BARTLETT Okay so who is consciously drinking water hands up. Looking good. Okay who had at least those six to eight glasses of water yesterday. Looks good, looks good. Okay. How many people tell the water does negative. 

00:14:35
It just makes you feel better and less tired and more awake and it makes you have a lot more energy too which I didn't believe at first I didn't think water could do that but it really does. 

00:14:45
MICHAEL AMORY As well as giving us more energy, water helps loosen tense muscle, reduces toxins in our body, it helps digestion and makes our skin healthier. 

00:14:55
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME I'm gonna just test a few muscles okay it's not… 

00:14:55
MICHAEL AMORY Through muscle testing Dr. Studholme showed the class how not drinking enough water can affect us. 

00:15:05
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME …okay so that muscle is not working. 

00:15:05
It's not. 

00:15:05
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME I'll push this way, you push that way. 

00:15:10
Okay. 

00:15:10
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME Go ahead push neither as that one. Push. what I'd like you to do is that actually well I work on somebody else if you would go and actually drink a glass of water. 

00:15:20
Okay 

00:15:20
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME And then come back and then we can test you again Okay. 

00:15:25
Okay 

00:15:25
AFTER DRINKING A GLASS OF WATER 

00:15:25
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME So where was (inaudible ) pull back pull. Okay she'll agree that feels very different than how it felt. Push out push. okay and it is that. So clearly can you see what just drinking a little water will do to the body, your muscles were shutdown because you're dehydrated. 

00:15:45
Yeah. 

00:15:45
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME Now that hadn't created a problem but the potential for you to stay dehydrated over a period of time and then you gotten to do something physical, these muscles not functioning appropriately but likelihood of you injuring yourself might be greater. 

00:15:55
MICHAEL AMORY Changing our eating and drinking habit is just one way to treat our bodies better. 

00:16:00
SLEEP 

00:16:00
MICHAEL AMORY How much sleep we get affect our stress level as well. 

00:16:05
Okay so your assessment this week is gonna be ah... looking at the difference… 

00:16:10
The more sleep in the bed and rest at you're, you're more taller(ph) and you're able to function better so I think sleep and rest are big part of relieving stress. 

00:16:15
Definitely like the nights when I stay up late trying to finish something or just do something I just don't go to bed the next day I'm a lot more irritable and I'm more likely to be stressed out by little things. 

00:16:30
EXERCISE 

00:16:35
MICHAEL AMORY Exercise is another good stress reliever, just moving our body eases some of the physical stress responses like tight muscles and elevated heart rate. So this is what I learned about physical stress, getting exercise, learning how to relax staying centered, watching what we eat, getting enough sleep and drinking plenty of water are some good ways we can reduce the impact of stress on our bodies. 

00:17:00
DR. NICHOLAS STUDHOLME Hopefully, this… this if anything else would I hope you guys can gain from this is that what we do or don't do to our bodies can profoundly affect us whether we are aware of it or not. 

00:17:15
STRESS and the mind 

00:17:15
MICHAEL AMORY How our minds respond to events in your lives can determine how stressed out we get. So one of the best ways to change our stress levels is to change the way we think about things. 

00:17:30
LINDA BARTLETT Now how many of you know you talk to yourself. This is called an internal… gentleman internal dialogue and forcefully(ph) lot of the internal dialogue that goes on inside our head aren't healthy. 

00:17:40
NEGATIVE SELF TALK 

00:17:40
Now usually what happens is I do something wrong and then when I'm just kinda alone I think about it and I say hey I shouldn't have done that, I should have done it differently. 

00:17:55
Should have done this instead of that why didn't you think about it at the same moment and how could you possibly think like that 

00:18:00
I have like bad habits like putting things over and over in my head like I tend to do like some of the stupidest things and in five minutes say like oh my God I can't believe I did that. 

00:18:15
It's kinda like you're stupid and said you had some here who want to talk to you but you just walked away. 

00:18:25
Sometimes I call myself worthless and then I shouldn't even like be here and I've really been myself up inside and tell myself things that I know, well that aren't true. 

00:18:35
Sometimes I could say nicely to myself but most of the time it would be negative like the words I say I can stay alone. 

00:18:40
I think I go through this same things like most American teenagers do you know like you're upset about how the way that you're, you don't feel like crying and because of like, partially because of the media and everything and the voice inside your head is like you're not perfect, you can't do this. Why do you try. 

00:19:00
MICHAEL AMORY Thinking you've to be perfect and not being able to live up to it is one way a lot of us stress ourselves out. Once you recognize your style of negative self talk, there are strategies you can use to change it. 

00:19:15
Oh let me get one okay analyze that… 

00:19:15
I don't like, I don't sit there and tell myself you know it's your fault, it's your fault you know because you're really missing some time you know, sometimes it is my fault but you know I don't like pile everything on me to that I write it down and you know just tell myself you just have to calm down be, it's gonna be okay you know and I think this is not, this is not the end of the world. 

00:19:35
But there is another saying where you also have to have your own little voice so that you can control this oh… you can do this it's simple you know. So I think that's the consciously thinking about it. You have to consciously think those positive thoughts to and try to sort of ignore the negative ones. 

00:19:55
Stop being so shy, that's probably one way to get rid of negative stuff talks of self, aren't we… 

00:20:05
…just put yourself out and explain yourself. 

00:20:05
Let people know I'm there. 

00:20:10
I think holding back is just creating stress as holding something inside and that's something that you don't want to do just adding burden. 

00:20:20
Sometimes I like read or play piano or go on the computer. 

00:20:20
TECHNOLOGY 

00:20:25
MICHAEL AMORY Technology does make things more efficient and it's hard to imagine life without it, but it can definitely create more mental stress. 

00:20:35
Like if you're stressed out about like a computer project they have to do may be you can't operate a computer very well or you don’t really get technology and you've got a huge midterm coming up on ah… computer then you're not gonna do very well. 

00:20:50
Oh media contributes to stress a lot, just like your television can stress you out because you can turn on the TV and the first thing you see is like... 

00:21:00
I was going on everywhere all the time and it just really not certainly that you can escape it. 

00:21:10
MICHAEL AMORY So what do you do for technological overload, turn off the machine, read a book, go outside do something physical. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:25
MICHAEL AMORY These are some ways I learned to deal with mental stress. Take a break, don't believe everything you think. Do a reality check, realize you don't have to be perfect and most importantly don't keep it all inside, talk to someone. 

00:21:40
Hey Justina(ph)… 

00:21:45
STRESS and The Emotions 

00:21:50
MICHAEL AMORY Our emotions are the filter through which we see the world on any given day. We can feel sad or happy or the emotion most often link with stress. 

00:22:00
Dude, I need my CD back. 

00:22:00
ANGER 

00:22:05
MICHAEL AMORY Anger. There is nothing wrong with anger. It's how we deal with it or don't deal with it, that can create problems. In health quest they call this mismanaging anger. We all have different ways of mismanaging anger. In class they identified four different anger style or four hot stones as they labeled them. Then each student tried to figure out which stones they were carrying, the silent but deadly stone. 

00:22:35
SILENT BUT DEADLY STONE VOLCANIC STONE RAZOR STONE REVENGE STONE 

00:22:35
MICHAEL AMORY The volcanic stone, the razor stone or the revenge stone. 

00:22:45
LINDA BARTLETT Let's start with the one that's not as easy to see and that's a silent but deadly stone, now it's there but it is hidden. And believe it or not myself not be in one of them there are those of you out there that if you're angry you don't want the world to know it. You keep that anger hidden. Is it still hot you botcher and is it burning you ah ha on the inside. 

00:23:15
I'm a silent but deadly because I keep things inside instead of sharing them with everyone else. 

00:23:25
Say someone in the hall making fun of you or you just really smile walk away but were nearly you're feeling anger but you can't express it. 

00:23:35
LINDA BARTLETT Okay that is the absolute opposite from this one over here called a volcanic stone. Now if those people are angry does anybody doubt it, wow alright they see red, and they see you you're on the receiving end of the anger. 

00:23:50
I explode at people a lot. When I get really angry with them. 

00:23:55
When I get angry, I tend to take that way beyond the line of where it should be taken and so when I get angry I get really angry and I just like start screaming and yelling. 

00:24:10
But then afterwards I feel really guilty for exploding and being so mean and saying things that I shouldn't haven't… 

00:24:15
LINDA BARTLETT And then oops I 'm sorry it doesn't quite repair the damage when the person is on the floor in a puddle alright a volcanic stone. Okay then we have the razor stone now the razor stone might look a little bit like the silent but deadly stone. On the outside these look fine, no problem. She get home when you're by yourself and all of a sudden that anger becomes a weapon that you use against yourself. Now it may not be something as drastic as the cutting but it could show itself in the different form… 

00:24:55
I go to sleep when I'm angry or stressed and I... spend… 

00:25:00
If I really need to hurting anything then really hurting myself or that seems like it would be better instead of hurting other people because if I hurt myself then I know what I am doing. 

00:25:10
LINDA BARTLETT And then we come to my specialty and that's the revenge stone. Oh I don't believe in getting even honey(ph) I believe in getting one up and I don't do it volcanically I smile I am your friend and when you're not looking ah I might stab you in the back. Oaky. Now doctor see what it reminds us that we can all show all characteristics. 

00:25:45
Around the house like when the parents are so like… it is like most explosive like yelling like talk back (inaudible ) I'm not like sort of like whom my foot ball team and stuff like that is more of a silent but like don't touch me type anger like if you touch me then this will happen to you. 

00:26:00
MICHAEL AMORY Whatever our hard stones are holding on to them for too long can hurt. 

00:26:05
DROPPING OUR HOT STONES 

00:26:05
MICHAEL AMORY Here are some other strategies to help cool down our hot stones. 

00:26:15
HUMOR HELPS 

00:26:15
Humor is actually reliving stress. 

00:26:20
I trip and fall. I can either be like really upset and embarrassed and be oh no everybody is laughing at me and everybody is looking at me and everybody will tease me about this or you can also laugh at it 

00:26:35
CRYING CAN BE GOOD FOR YOU 

00:26:35
You know when you feel really bad about and just everything (inaudible ) you need to just cry and afterwards you feel so much better. 

00:26:41
THINK BEFORE YOU ACT 

00:26:41
Dude I need my CD. Like I'm a teapot you know I've reached boiling point and I'm about to start whistling and when I start whistling you know you got to take me off the heater and let me cool down. 

00:26:55
Instead of exploding at someone try to think the whole situation through at first and you know perhaps try to see their point of view that calms you down. 

00:27:05
I think it's just it gives you a way of backing out of it and saying wow you know this is what I'm doing, this is how I'm acting you know and actually look at yourself acting like that. 

00:27:20
When you're angry, the best thing to do is keep your mouth shut. I mean… because that's when things get sad they don't really you don't mean 'em there just you know almost like barriers or wall you're just trying to put up and then some of the things really do hurt. 

00:27:35
Usually, you know I just sit down read a book or just write or write poems or write down whatever I feel like I don't want to think about what's happening like I just got on fought with my friend rather than like you know sit down and like okay this is fine you know maybe it's my fault, maybe it's her fault but like we can always solve the problem. 

00:27:55
I'm just like okay you know let's sit down and talk this out like adults(ph) do, breathe. 

00:28:00
GET physical 

00:28:00
Breathe… 

00:28:00
Football and like lifting weights go hand in hand and I feel like those are good stress relievers just because it's almost like instead of if I got mad enough to hit somebody I could on the way roaming I can hit the weights you know. 

00:28:15
Whenever like some events occurs, it stresses me out usually just walking outside and as many as like three, four miles even. 

00:28:25
DO SOMETHING CREATIVE 

00:28:30
There is no wrong way to do this. 

00:28:30
MICHAEL AMORY Art therapy is one creative way to relieve stress and deal with anger. 

00:28:35
ART THERAPY 

00:28:35
DR. BRIAN LUKE SEAWARD ,Ph.D Art therapy is drawing certain images by some of the themes that we have up in the board here I'll explain those in second and then letting your… your unconscious mind speak to you in the colors or shapes whatever that comes to mind. Okay. Up in the board there are six themes. The first theme says draw how you feel when you're angry or afraid or if you want both. Okay. So draw anything you want. Draw anything you want okay. No one is gonna catch you, do whatever you want, because I want you to have the freedom to draw whatever you want and we get down these, I'm gonna have you interpret your own drawings. 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:25
That in the class when we did the art therapy, I… you know I didn't really think anything of it you know I'm not a really good drawer and when I finished it, I look at it a lot and I put it up in my room because I can actually see that represents you know all the stuff we're talking about know, represents like the change I went through and the change I'm still going through and like the color has made sense and I thought that it was really like it was really powerful. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:30:15
the picture was me looking in a mirror, and seeing um… someone larger than I am and that's what I see when I look at myself in the mirror. 

00:30:30
[sil.] 

00:30:40
I thought the colors are really interesting actually, I just think the way that I can relate it actually what you drew. Even though you knew you're supposed to be drawing something because how I relate to and someway you like know that but then when you actually find out, do you actually do relate it to it and it relates to you which really would. 

00:30:55
WHAT COLORS MEAN 

00:30:55
DR. BRIAN LUKE SEAWARD So if you have red in your picture then this unconsciously means that there is passion about something okay. Question is which direction anger or love? 

00:31:05
I did anger, and I drew a volcano and this is zipper at the top and sometimes I feel like I can't release my anger it was a like volcano couldn't let there was a zipper. 

00:31:20
DR. BRIAN LUKE SEAWARD Orange means change, when you see orange in your picture if you put orange there orange means there is change that's gonna occur or you're trying to bring in change to your life. Yellow, yellow means energy and when you've got yellow in your picture that means there is some energy coming into your life coming into some project you're doing, coming into some activity you're doing that means that this now has some energy behind it. The colors blue, green, and brown are colors of stability or the earthtone colors so when you've got, if you've got blue, green or brown in your picture, this means that you feel very secure about whatever you've drawn about. okay now we have few other color, black, black has two different meaning. Black can either be fear or can be empower. If you have white, white could either mean a sense of faith or a sense of fear and if you picked grey, grey means there is… there is indecisiveness. The colors purple and pink are colors of spirituality if you've got pink or purple in your drawing there that means at some level you're aware of a bigger picture. 

00:32:40
The colors kind of make sense you know because like yellow energy entering in fishes life and I guess like the hippo is extremely stable. 

00:32:50
The red I think is because is really passion about how she feels and white is like there is little hope in it but the rest is all black in darkness. 

00:33:00
I put blue(ph) here because it seems like everything else is peaceful outside of where I am and I don't like when I'm angry so I try to ruin it as much as possible. 

00:33:05
DR. BRIAN LUKE SEAWARD The colors make sense to you? 

00:33:10
Yeah. 

00:33:10
DR. BRIAN LUKE SEAWARD Isn't that interesting. (inaudible ) did the colors make sense to you when I said those isn't that amazing. 

00:33:15
Yeah. 

00:33:15
MICHAEL AMORY Even the colors we wear can say something about how we feel. 

00:33:20
Okay who consciously today chose colors to facilitate their moods. Hands up. and look who is wearing a color than black congratulations boys. Proud of you. 

00:33:30
BUILDING CRISIS KIT 

00:33:35
MICHAEL AMORY Here is another idea for coping with emotional stress. Building a crisis kit in which you collect things that help you keep clam and put them in a box. Each item relates to one of the five senses. Sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. 

00:33:55
In 1998 I was a catcher and I got like two (inaudible ) at home which was like a really big deal for me. 

00:34:00
SUSAN HARVEY The purpose of a crisis kit is to have things gathered altogether um prior to having those feelings when life feels very difficult, you heart is racing, your brain really can't put things together logically. So if you get those items altogether something that addresses all of the five senses you need to include something for each sense and when that time hits you have a already to be able to utilize. One of the thing that's really critical about doing the five senses is that what you include in your crisis kit are things that represent times that were more powerful, that were more tranquil, times when things were okay and right and what it does as those having those things in front of you and being able to touch those things and smell and taste those things. It takes you to a place puts your whole psyche out those places were things were okay. 

00:34:55
 Yes, hot chocolate is like I’d go to my grandma’s house and I'd also chew my hot chocolate and ham sandwiches and that really… you know this would sound like a good combination but it was… 

00:35:05
KEEPING A JOURNAL 

00:35:10
MICHAEL AMORY One thing that a lot of people find helps them deal with the stressful times in life is writing a journal. 

00:35:15
 …stupid songs and stories in home, just random stuff and… 

00:35:20
 And I have my journal that I write a lot of stuff in, and it’s like the only thing I can really talk to right now because I don’t really have anyone I can talk to. So it helps me get through my days and it’s really nice. 

00:35:35
 I’d like to encourage all of you to think about keeping a journal. That’s an incredible way to... for you to process through things that have happened that don’t make sense. So it’s truly an awesome tool that you’ll be able to use your entire life and for guys it’s still a very cool thing. 

00:35:50
 Writing something I like to do… I'd like to do that as much as I like my sport. 

00:35:55
 (inaudible ) 

00:35:56
 I don’t pay over sometimes you have a goal like poetry or a song or some like that that comes out with. I just think writing as a whole is a… is a good tool like a lot of people that I know journal and things like that and I think that's great I think that’s a… that’s a really good way to get stress out because it's just… stress is just like a lot of things built up inside and writing and… and talking are… are good ways to release them and get 'em outside. 

00:36:25
 And then I start my music… 

00:36:30
MUSIC 

00:36:30
 Music is a good thing to putting your stress kit. Different music works with different people. 

00:36:35
 I brought the CD (inaudible ) and jazz. 

00:36:37
 And I have my CD of all my favorite songs. 

00:36:40
 I’ve got Eminem when I am just really… 

00:36:45
 I put the Greece CD and like that because literally listen to it, it just makes me happy. 

00:36:50
 Different music connects the different people in their own special way like for me I am not even really ah… a heavy rap listener, me, I like RMB and things of that nature. It's just because they have soothing beats you know most of time soothing lyrics. 

00:37:05
 Music can either stress you out or relief stress. It's all like the different kinds of mu… music. Listening to music that’s like more like heavy and like my mental stuff. It can help like… it just helps me sort of relax (inaudible ) weird but um… it's just like just cheering it and then you sort of relax and you like don’t feel as angry anymore and you just like enjoy the music. 

00:37:30
 I always love listening to hip hop and ah… recently within the past two years I discovered that there was more to it than just meets the eye and that you know there is a whole world out there that nobody knows about as far as music you know and that’s… that’s what led me into you know listening to underground hip hop and writing poetry and ah… you know it got me into a whole different group of friends that were just nothing but positive energy. 

00:37:55
MEDITATION 

00:38:00
MICHAEL AMORY One of the best ways to relieve emotional and mental stress is through meditation. People have been meditating in the east for centuries. Now scientists in the west are looking at the positive effects of meditation and brain chemistry, an autoimmune system. 

00:38:15
 You sort of close your eyes and you try to concentrate on like you're breathing or something and you don’t really think about what’s going on like about war or about like your boyfriend or something, so you just concentrate on like breathing and then like you try not to think, actually you sort of like clear your mind and you just breath and it's just sort of like… you're sort of like in a different time and when you open your eyes, you're like relaxed and energized at the same time. 

00:38:40
 It does help me stay awake so I can like if I am doing homework and I am really tired you know. If I meditate for like 20 minutes then I am not tired anymore and I can finish the homework and then I am not as stress because homework is stressing you know. 

00:38:55
 I felt a lot more relaxed and like clearheaded I you know tend to push everything out of my mind, I have someone start thinking about the same time, so like when I just kind of pushed out for a few minutes, I felt a lot calmer. 

00:39:10
MICHAEL AMORY In meditation you learn to focus your attention on your breath as a way to relax and be more present. When you find yourself caught up in your thoughts you just bring yourself back to your breath. 

00:39:20
 Mediation is really one way to calm down because as I said in the beginning of this, I really liked to rush around a lot and I am really obsessed with being on time and having everything to be perfect. And meditation is… it's really ah… a good way for me to relax. 

00:39:40
 As you do this your mind's eye follow the flow of air. 

00:39:40
MICHAEL AMORY You don’t have to meditate sitting, you can meditate lying down. 

00:39:45
 Leave your mind so you can become more relaxed another metaphor that might be similar to… to use here is um… thrown away all the emails that you no longer need, because they are taking much space. So if you don’t clean up your mailbox pretty soon, you can’t get more mail or if you don’t cleanse your mind of all thoughts and feelings that no longer help us then pretty soon we have a hard time processing information. 

00:40:10
 Toe, heel, go slow, go slow toe, heel, toe, heel. 

00:40:15
MICHAEL AMORY You can even meditate walking. 

00:40:20
 Now I want you to continue with your eyes closed. I’ll (inaudible ) anything. So continue going straight eyes closed toe, heel trust yourself, feel balanced. 

00:40:40
 Ah… this meditation (inaudible ) ah… because it’s… it's funny but you're… you're still relaxed as you’re doing it. 

00:40:45
 So again the purpose of this is to teach yourself balance. When you are physically balanced people, you’re gonna to do a better job and be emotionally balanced. 

00:40:55
MICHAEL AMORY Another way to meditate is by looking at clouds. 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:05
 You know when you… when you're looking up the clouds you don’t really you… it’s really easy to do and you… your just your odd nature and your… I don’t know you're just kind of focusing why the clouds are not thinking about anything not stressful and that your breathing slows down and you're just like relaxing and you'll kind of laugh in your own little fantasy world like if you see a dragon or something then you probably remember like a story that you read about dragons. 

00:41:30
 When we're just randomly driving somewhere, I look up into the clouds and I'll just find something that looks like something like I find a cloud that looks like a dinosaur and then as we pass it, it changes into another thing and I have to feel that is just some… for my mind. 

00:41:50
MICHAEL AMORY So these are some of the techniques I learned to relieve emotional stress. Learn to recognize and drop your heart stones, laugh more, cry when you have to, find creative outlets like our therapy, journaling and music. Create a crisis kit, talk to someone you trust, take up meditation, and don’t forget to breath. 

00:42:15
STRESS and The Spirit 

00:42:20
MICHAEL AMORY Stress can affect not only our mind and body and emotions, it can also affect our spirits. You know how you can just feel down sometimes for no real reason that’s stressful. In general isolating ourselves is stressful and reaching out to others relieves stress. Getting involved with others in our communities, joining groups, volunteering or mentoring can help us relieve stress and feel better. 

00:42:50
 That makes you feel like actually a part of something and you're actually doing some of that… someone else will benefit from, so you kind of get that feeling that you like… and there is a purpose for you of what you are doing and that's the best thing for our life. 

00:43:00
MICHAEL AMORY After spending so much time with each other, the health quest students made some surprising discoveries. 

00:43:05
 What really surprised me is like, everybody who is in the class is now like closer I mean those people in this class that I never really talk to before and now it’s like I can talk to them, like yeah we have something in common. 

00:43:20
 It really surprised me that I made new friends just like… so I usually stick to like my group of really close friends and then I just talk to everyone else but a group of really close friends has gotten bigger recently. Yeah it’s better. 

00:43:35
 Oh yeah it's because you realize that other people have the exact same problems as you and you like… well, we're so much alike. 

00:43:45
 I don’t know if I have changed myself but I’ve changed (inaudible ) to other people. 

00:43:50
 They used to lock myself in my room but I actually wouldn't talk to them and stuff. 

00:43:50
 Before… he… they… he'd look at people like perhaps and there is you know like the other kids the (inaudible ) but ever since his class you know he kind… he kind of get to look at everyone the same you know everyone has something different about him. 

00:44:10
MICHAEL AMORY Connecting with others is just one way to keep our spirits up and relieve stress. Here are some other ideas. 

00:44:20
 I recommend just to be yourself and don’t try to be like other people and just to be comfortable with who you are and just to deal with the step in the right way. 

00:44:30
 Be yourself and don’t hide from that just let people know how you're feeling and don’t be afraid to tell them about anything. 

00:44:40
 I'm just trying to be more open to my feelings, my true feelings, which I haven’t before health quest. 

00:44:45
 I used to be ah… more shy than I'm and you know like I come up and talk (inaudible ) so I'm a little bit about that. 

00:44:55
MICHAEL AMORY Stressful situations may be all around us, but we don’t need to let them stresses out. Bringing balance to our body, mind, spirit and emotions can keep stress from getting us down and help us feel happier and healthier in our lives.
