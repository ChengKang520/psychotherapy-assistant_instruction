REBECCA E. MICHEL I'm Dr. Becky Michel, and I'm a faculty member at Governors State University. And today I'll be sharing a bit more about developing student's strengths to promote college and career readiness. Today, we'll be taking a journey. We're gonna be talking about college and career readiness. We're gonna be talking about focus and motivation, and then we'll be covering, identifying and developing student strengths. College and Career readiness, this is a buzz phrase that has been going around the K-12 schools now for a few years. And essentially, the ASCA National Model, which is the model that guides the interventions, the school counselors perform, has made an emphasis that we need to help students develop their college and career readiness. And this has been promoted all the way up to the White House, with Michelle Obama's reach higher initiative. In which, it gives the expectation that all students will complete some degree of post secondary education. Whether that is in an apprenticeship program or a two-year community college or entering a four-year university. But essentially, the expectation from the top of the White House that because we know who really runs the show, right? From the top of the White House that we all must be College and Career Ready. In order to really create a, an environment and a work place within America, where people will have the skills to thrive. So comprehensive school counseling programs strive to, to develop Career Ready Students. These are students who understand that there is many different life roles that they're going to have. And they are ready to make choices about their careers, about their occupations, about… They know about their interest, so that they can find jobs and careers that are satisfying to them. And again, following high school they might go directly into the work place with some apprenticeship, you know, or they may enroll in some college or a community college. And whichever one of these paths that somebody takes, the important aspect is that they are student-directed and the student feels ready to make those decisions. So there has been also in addition to College and Career Readiness, a strong focus on focus, strong focus on Focus and Motivation. And if you think about school, and if you think about your own experience is in school, or those of children in your lives, many times we have the focus on the wrong thing. So for this example, this is a snapshot of a student whom I worked with named Kylie. And Kylie is a high school junior and you can see her grades. You could see she's earned grades all across the alphabet, right? And here's some things about Kylie. She was raised in a low socioeconomic status income. She is from a single parent household. She likes to spend time with her friends and her significant other. She doesn't like school. She gets along well with one teacher, and that's her algebra teacher. And then she is essentially planning to drop out of school and try to get a job as a Bank Teller. So most people, when and even, you know, myself when you would first start working with the student, it would be easy to focus on what's not going well, right? There is a lot of Ds and Fs within this picture, right? There is a couple of Cs, one B, and a few As. And so most teachers, most parents and guardians are probably going to focus again on what's not going well. But in order to incorporate a positive physiology, slant on this, in order to motivate people using their strengths, we would focus on what's going well. So we would ask her instead of questions about Spanish and U.S. History which she clearly doesn't like, we would ask her questions about algebra and economics. Look at this. She doesn't like school, but she gets along with her algebra teacher. Wow! She's doing pretty well in algebra and in economics. So let's focus on those areas in order to figure out why she's doing so well. She has some career plans to go into banking, may be if we can cultivate that interest, develop her strengths, encourage that relationship, maybe we can encourage her to stay involved and engaged in high school, so that she can graduate. And then transfer into maybe an apprenticeship program or an internship or something following graduation, to give her a lot more choices when she actually completes high school. So that's an example of Kylie. And again, we often focus on what students are doing wrong. But we know that student happiness, fulfillment and success can be attained through more than identification of your problems. Who wants to talk about what's not going well, right? We have to talk about that at some point, but one of we focus about what is going well in your life, apply those strategies to work around this areas that are not going well. So positive psychology again, is the study of what goes right in life. So these are again positive experiences like happiness, positive traits and emotions, like strengths and values, positive relationships, and then positive groups in institution. And positive psychology is a different way to look at the world, it's not meant to replace the, the previous view of psychology in psychotherapy. Instead, it's meant to provide a more well-rounded balanced view by looking at both the strengths as well as the areas of growth for each person. So how can we do this? Identifying and developing strengths. There is three main ways that I am going to suggest that we can develop student strengths to promote College and Career Readiness. The first, is to help students identify talents and strengths. The second, is to find a college or major that fits with their knowledge, skills and strengths. And then the third, although it says one, one, one, the third is to increase student engagement well-being and success. So first, help students identify their talents and strengths. I want you to just pause for a second and consider, what are you good at? Sometimes, that's not as easy of an answer to come up with as we might think, right? So there is a several different ways that we can help students to identify their strengths. And one is an assessment, that was developed by Dr. Martin Seligman and he is known as the Father of Positive Psychology. You've heard about him, I'm sure before. And so he, within the center of a Positive Psychology has helped to create an assessment called the VIA Signature Strengths. And you can learn more about that on the Pennsylvania Positive Psychology Center and these assessments are all free of charge and so they're wonderful for K-12 students, right? We don't have a lot of money when we're working with students in the schools and so it's great to find free resources. And so what the positive psychology centre did was they created an assessment similar to other assessments such as strengths finder that measures character strengths, so these are strengths and virtues that are again across cultures. Such as wisdom, humanity, temperance, courage, justice, transcendence. These are cross cultural. And one of the neatest things about the VIA strengths, is not only that it's free, but that they have a version that's specifically for kids. So if you're working with elementary or middle school students, there's an assessment that's in language that would be developmentally appropriate for them. And so why would we want to follow these strengths based approach? Knowing your strengths can help you be happier, have better relationships, improve your health and your school performance and help you to accomplish your goals. And using a strengths based approach, allows you to be honest. So it helps you to have an accurate picture of where you are at. Not boosting, you know, in areas that you're not good at, but really where am I good and how can I continue to develop that. It's positive. We focus on what's good rather than focusing on what our problems and our weakness are. It's very empowering, it… Although it's difficult to talk about what we're good at, it feels good, it feels good when people, when a school counselor, you know, or a counselor who's working with students can recognize what's good about your life right now, what are you doing well, that feels good. It's energizing. When we're acting in our area of talents and strengths, we are motivated, we… It, it gives us a lot of energy because we are doing something that we really enjoy. And then finally, it helps us to connect with people because they can recognize what we're good at. And we can recognize and celebrate what we're good at as well. So on the VME website, you login, you create, you know, a password and everything, and you take a very short assessment. And what it does, the VIA Signature Strength, is it gives you a whole list of different areas in which you have an area of strength, according to their assessment. And so these areas look different from other assessments, such as the strengths finder and other ones that I have, that we've mentioned before. These… Some examples of them might be an appreciation of beauty, not something that you'd normally think of as a strength, right? And yet, this assessment is able to capture the fact that there is something unique about you that helps you to appreciate the beauty around you and how can we use that strength in order to help you to find productive things to do in high school. Well, you appreciate beauty, why not we enroll you in a psychology class? So you can learn more about all the wonderful things, the beautiful things that people have done throughout time. Why don't we help you… Let's get an elective in your schedule, like painting or photography, so that you can recognize what's happening around you, you can see the beauty and you can capture that in order to demonstrate it to others. People who do not may be excel well academically in traditional subjects, when they can find some of these strengths, it can help a school counselor, you know, our clinical mental health counselor work with students to be able to find some passion areas for them. Because at the end of the day, we need to help students become career ready and connect what they're doing in the class room, to what's going to be happening in the real world outside of the class room, right? So for somebody who appreciates beauty and I guess, it's you. We're going to recognize that, we're going to celebrate that, we're going to get you in the clubs and classes to help you cultivate that strength because if you like what you're doing, you're probably going to know like what you're doing after high school as well. So developing strength is about three things. Discovery, creation and ownership. Discovery happens when we're listening to what our students and our clients are saying. We're identifying their strengths, we're giving them the VIA strengths to be able to help them identify and actually name what they are good at. It's about creation, finding ways in their everyday life as an elementary school student to be able to appreciate their strengths and utilize them, and then finally, as taking ownership of them. So two, we want to find a college or career that fits their knowledge skills and strengths. And so you want to use knowledge, your own knowledge about college and careers, in order to help them make career decisions. So again, if somebody is, let's say has strong strength in humor, then you want to help them find a classes to take, clubs to involve themselves in high school or and in the lower levels to help them encourage that humor. But then also, we want to help them to find ways to express that humor out in the real world, right? So there are lots of jobs and careers where somebody has to be humorous. So like a waitress or a waiter, has to… There're an entertainer of some sort, right? Clearly an actress or an actor or a comedian, anybody really who is in sales or needs to, you know, correspond with people on a regular basis, must have humor. And that is something that celebrated, not everyone has it, believe me and when somebody has that humor, then you can help them to find that appropriate outlet for it, whether than being the class clown who's getting in trouble for it. So use what you know about them and their strengths in order to help them find appropriate outlets for those strengths. And then finally, we want to increase student engagement well-being and success. And we can do that by utilizing the Gallup Student Success Model. And this model was developed by Gallup institute, which studies, how people work and how people… What makes people tick? And they have developed a model that helps us to recognize how can we help students be the most successful in their academic lives and then moving into their post secondary careers. And so this focus is on strengths which we have talked a lot about, this focus is on hope and engagement which are characteristics of strengths. It focuses on well-being which is a foundation of the counseling field and wellness and then it focuses on academic success. So how can we increase our strengths? How can we increase our engagement and our hope within the positive school environment and then how does that increase than our level of academic success. So I encourage you to research a little bit more about the Gallup Students Success Model. It's very interesting. They're starting to collect some very, very promising data on this. That's really helping to shift the focus within schools on, you know, what's going wrong in schools to what's going right in schools. And how can we, how can we help people to be more successful and happy when they're in these schools. So that is the end of the presentation today and I'd like to allow a few minutes for some questions.

UNKNOWN Dr. Michel, I'm curious about how long these practices have been used in kindergarten to high school? 

00:16:05
REBECCA E. MICHEL Yes. So thank you for clarifying that. So K-12 is kindergarten through 12th grade. And honestly, these practices have not been implemented at a widespread scale for very long, and it seems like that's not surprising to you. And it's really been a shift in focus that has come from Gallup and has come from research that has been done that it's really more helpful to focus on student engagement and student hope, in order to increase achievement. And so only over the past few years have K-12 institutions and even institutions of the higher education started to think about academic success in this way, it's the previous model was, okay, this person is not doing good at this, let's drill it into their heads until they get good at it. And this is a very different shift and as you can imagine, not everyone is on board for it and so, what I tried to do in my work is to first start with the educators and to go into schools and to go into organizations and to try to help them realize what's the role that the educator has in identifying and cultivating students strengths. And then once you can the educator by in, then you can start, you know, trickling that down to the students. When the educators know these are what… This is what I'm good at. This is how I can use my strengths in the class room, then you can start helping the educators, the teachers, the social workers, the administrators within kindergarten through 12th grade. You can start having them utilize and practice strengths based language. So they know what they are good at, so that when they are leading a group or leading a math class or whatever they can then identify, okay, this is the strength of this student. I'm going to pull them out a little bit using this strength, rather than that student is not good at, you know, math, they are the class clown and I'm just going to try to ignore that behavior until it goes away. When it's a strength or talent, that behavior is not going to go away, so let's find a way to cultivate it. Does that answer your questions? 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Yes. Thank you very much! 

00:18:25
REBECCA E. MICHEL Okay, great! Are there other questions, anybody? All right. Well, thank you so much and I appreciate your time.
