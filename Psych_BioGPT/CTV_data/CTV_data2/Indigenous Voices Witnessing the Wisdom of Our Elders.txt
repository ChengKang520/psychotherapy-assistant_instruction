MARIE L. MIVILLE And so today we have a similar conversation planned, though of course with individuals who've been tremendous leaders in our field. And I'm happy to say that four of our panel members today have been Janet Helms Mentoring Award winners and so here they are and actually for, this goes for all the panel winners. I mean, all the panel members, truly wise learners, willing and brave enough to discuss their personal and professional lives this morning with us. Now, of course, I could be here all day citing their incredible accomplishments. I will just briefly highlight the bios of each of our speakers and, you know, we do have some students and some new professionals so we know you are well known but when I say your name just raise your hand a little bit so the people in the audience can know who you are. Okay. And then I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Joseph Ponterotto to moderate the discussion. First I'd like to introduce Jean Lau Chin and Professor Chin is at Adelphi University, New York. She was the Dean of the Derner Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies at Adelphi University and the Systemwide Dean of the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University. She's held many senior leadership positions such as the President of the CEO services, Executive… Executive Director of Community Health Centre, Co-director of a child guidance clinic, Regional Director of managed care. She's a licensed psychologist, recently published a wonderful special issue on leadership in diversity in the American psychologists. To me that's recommended required reading for any of us who wants to do consultation leadership. And of course, she has had a number of distinguished awards including the 2009 Women of Distinction Award. Teresa LaFromboise, is a professor in the School of Education and Chair of Native American Studies in the School of Humanities and Science at Stanford University. She specializes in the prevention of stress related problems of native American youth. She's a recognized contributor of the native American mental health initiatives and she's published many, many works in this area. And for those of us who have worked with native American populations, you know, you… you just can't do work without knowing and reading the… the information Dr. LaFromboise has published. She is a fellow of both the APA and the American Psychological Science and she too has won a number of distinguished awards including from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Carter Center for Public Policy at Emory and the First Nations Behavioral Health Association. Thomas Parham - He is the Interim Vice Chancellor for students affairs and… and an adjunct faculty member at the University of California, Irvine. He is the past-President of the National Association of Black Psychologists where he also holds the title of distinguished psychologist. Dr. Parham is a fellow of the American Counseling Association as well as the American Psychological Association. He is past president of the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development and a member of 100 Black Men of America. He too has a very distinguished record and career in terms of publications. He has a brand new edition of his book. Dr. Parham what's the name of you’re… the book that you have a new edition of? 

00:05:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM It's called the Psychology of Blacks, centering our perspective in the African Context. 

00:05:05
MARIE L. MIVILLE And Dr. Parham will be conducting a workshop this afternoon, talking about the first chapter of that on African spirituality. He has won numerous awards like all the other panel members, the Research Achievement award from APA's minority fellowship, the Research Award for Contributions to the Counseling Profession from the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development and the James M. Jones Lifetime Achievement award for the minority fellowship program. That’s just a few of the awards. And of course, our moderator Dr. Joseph Ponterotto. He's professor of counseling of coordinator of mental health counseling program at Fordham, right here in New York City. Born, raised and schooled in the Bronx and he's the product of an immigrant Italian family hailing from Abruzzi, Italy. And he started his journey as a multicultural pioneer. He actually published his beautiful piece last year in the Counseling Psychologist on his multicultural personality. It’s a fantastic construct and he's working very hard on a… on a scale and he actually shared his journey about how he began that as an eight-year-old child, when his family emigrated back to Italy and just his experience of learning the language, watching others kind of struggle with the language and how that planted the seed for his multicultural interest and why he's here today. And he too is the author of many books. And as I said he's also a former recipient of the Janet Helms Mentoring Award. Dr. Trimble, Dr. Joseph Trimble is at the end of the panel there, on the other side. Formerly… There he goes! Formerly a fellow at Harvard University, a distinguished university professor and professor of psychology at Western Washington University. He's the President's Professor at the Center for Alaskan Native Health Research at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. And of course, he too has held many offices in our… in our organizations. Has fellow status in three APA divisions. He's generated over a 130 publications, a 130 publications including 17 edited or co-authored books. Amazing productivity! I also wanna say, he too has won just many, many awards also a mentoring award winner here at the college. Has been a distinguished elder award with the Multicultural Summit, the Henry Tomes Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Psychology. It's just scads of actual accomplishments, just from a personal perspective. Actually, this goes for all the panel members. But Dr. Trimble when I began directing this conference three years ago, generously stepped right up when I asked him to do our opening keynote. He generously and immediately said, "Absolutely Marie, anything I can do to help support the roundtable." And so, for that… Dr. Trimble, Dr. Barcus talked yesterday about what an incredible mentor Dr. Trimble has been to her and to many of us here in the field. So I'm very honored to… to welcome Dr. Trimble this morning. And of course, last but not least, Melba Vasquez. Please! Melba is no less than the current APA President. And what that means, she is the first Latino. The first woman of color ever to be President of the American Psychological Association. This is a 120-year-old history and we're only just getting to electing our first woman of color and we're very, very proud, happy that Melba is… is the one and that she's here this morning and this is her birthday weekend. So, talk about commitment. And she of course has had many, many leadership positions, President of the Texas Psychological Association, divisions of 35. She was actually the co-founder, one of the co-founders of the National Multicultural Summit back in 1999, many of us were there. And so one of her zillion accomplishments is the establishment of this wonderful summit that it continues very proudly and strongly. She is the author of over 70 journal articles and again the recipient of numerous awards including the 2010 Carolyn Wood Sherif Award from the APA Division 35. She too is a Janet Helms Mentoring Award winner. And Dr. Parham of course is our other Janet Helms Mentoring award winner. He too has been one of the strong advocates and supporters of this event. So, welcome, please welcome with me this incredible panel and Dr. Ponterotto to the podium.

JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Marie. Everybody hear me? Good morning. Welcome to day two of this marvelous roundtable. Are you ready for another amazing day of learning and networking? How did yesterday go? Pretty good? How many of you felt you learned something yesterday that will make you a more competent clinician or educator? Raise your hand. Okay! Well, brace yourself, for today, from now until 7 pm this evening, we will be further transformed, that I can promise you. Well, look who we have here on the stage. How humble and honored do you think I feel right now? Welcome mentors, welcome elders of great vision, welcome brothers and sisters. May I ask the elders just to take a moment and introduce yourselves, but this time from a culturally indigenous perspective just for a minute. And perhaps if you would like to tap your… your indigenous language if you would like to, just for a… just a brief minute, each person. If we can start with Professor Trimble.

JOSEPH TRIMBLE Good morning. It's a good day. I am Lakota and I just gave thanks to my grandfathers and grandmothers. My Lakota name is two(ph) sitting(ph) bulls(ph), that occurred to me during what we call the Hanblecheyapi, which is a vision quest. And when that occurred a long time ago when I wasn’t an elder, that was the vision that I had. And of course as… as… as is the tradition is the long story associated with it, I'm so pleased to be here and honored and thank you all for coming. And I'm thrilled to be with my friends and colleagues on the stage. Thank you. 

00:12:55
DR. JOSEPH PONTEROTTO (Inaudible ) 

00:12:56
THOMAS A. PARHAM I'll simply say good morning to the folk and allow me if you will to call on the creator and my ancestors to bear with this to my remarks in hopes that what they hear this morning through my words and utterances will reflect their way and they will be pleased. That’s it. 

00:13:15
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother.

MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ Good morning, I'm Melba Vasquez. I'm Mexican-American and grew up calling myself Chicano from Texas and I'm very happy to be here with you today. 

00:13:45
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Melba 

00:13:45
JEAN LAU CHIN Excuse me! 

00:13:50
[non-English narration] 

00:13:55
JEAN LAU CHIN So, I said good morning and I welcome everybody to participate in this and wish you a happy new year, because we just celebrated it about two weeks ago. And for those of you who understood Chinese you can hear my English accent in some of that, for those… since I'm American born. But for those of you who are not, I sound pretty good, right? 

00:14:25
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Jean. 

00:14:30
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Okay! Good morning. This is going to be the most acculturated response that you've heard this morning. I'm very happy to be here. I am of Miami background from Indiana and European-American background on my father's side. Miami and Irish of my mother, German and English on my father's side. And so I've always sort of… wasn’t until Maria Root's work on multiracial identity that I realized that I was a mixed race person, but I'm certainly have always been very proud of my native background. Thank you. 

00:15:05
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Teresa. Dear elders may I have your permission to speak for a couple of minutes? At an elder panel much like this one a few years ago, I was deeply impacted by the healing experiences in words of wisdom of one of our native elders, Dr. Eduardo Duran. He taught us that day about two related concepts, the soul wounds, a deep penetrating hurt and pain that can be transmitted across generations and our interconnectedness across seven generations in both suffering and healing. Allow me to paraphrase from Dr. Duran as he spoke. "My root teacher a holy man, taught me that one is… that when one is hurt or wounded, it is at all levels of the person, the body, the mind and the soul. My teacher's rationale was clear", he said, "the body, well it knows how to and can heal itself. The mind, well trained counselors and clinicians can alleviate some wounds of the mind. However, because of the body's and minds close ties to the soul, we must also heal the soul. If the soul is not healed, the wounding is passed on to the next generation for at least seven generations. Therefore, the issue being dealt with involves seven past generations as well as seven generations into the future. In that sense, the work we do as clinicians, in the moment with our clients and patients, is not only in that moment but transcends all the moments of seven generations past and seven generations yet to come. Think? How important then is our work with our clients, session to session, day to day? As soul wounds can be passed down among the generations past and yet to come, so can soul healing. One soul healing strategy is to tap into, to connect with, the healing spirit of our indigenous roots. Our own ancestors whose strengths and sacrifice have forged(ph) a path for our work, for our mission on this earth." This morning we will witness, we will feel the wisdom of our elders. As we know the term elder is not necessarily a designation of chronological age but one of integrated life experience, visionary wisdom and a healing and teaching power that is actually quite difficult to describe in words. As we honor our elders on this historic stage this morning let us also draw on the spirit and the wisdom of our audience elders. May I ask that anyone in the audience whose been in the field for say 25 years or more please stand just for a moment, if you've been in the field 25 years or more. Just stay standing for a moment, thank you. For those of you who're sitting, look around, sometimes there is elder wisdom closer by than we might think. Note our standing elders and seek their guidance that bias(ph) and experiences throughout the day and at our reception this evening. Thank you elders. I imagine that in the auditorium this morning we may not have all seven generations as Professor Duran speaks, but perhaps we have five generations of healers and teachers. Let me ask our youngest generation now, those perhaps 25 years of age or younger if you'll stand for a second, anybody younger than 25? Just stand and stay standing for a second. Look around you, witness the generations of wisdom you'll behold this long day. For the youth who are standing now, let us honor you. Your healing path, your future leadership, by asking your permission with a nod of the head to begin our session this morning. Thank you. The format this morning will include our elders processing a few questions and thoughts out loud followed by extensive audience interaction through your questions, your reflections, your experiences. So at about 11:15, we'll pause with the sharing and move to questions. Though our elders are a priority today so are your voices. We wanna make sure that you have the time to interact with our audience. We will begin now with Professor Trimble, who'll have the… who we will bestow the honor by beginning the processing of our first question. Let me read that aloud. And as I ask these questions I'd like you to spend a moment and just think which ancestors in your life had laid the path, had given you the strength to forge on. Thinking back to your childhood, what were some words of wisdom passed down by your elders that you have relied on and that have helped guide you in your life's work. Is there a particular story, anecdote or memory that has stayed with you that you can share? So why don't we start with Professor Trimble. 

00:20:20
JOSEPH TRIMBLE Thank you Joe. Call him Joe from the East.

00:20:35
JOSEPH TRIMBLE A long time ago, our native American student union at Western Washington University was holding a (inaudible ) and as it's the custom there is a feed and so everyone was congregating in the feed area and the… the announcer gets up and says, "okay, this is our tradition, the elders are the first to be fed." So I'm sitting there talking with a group of students and people were getting up and getting in line to get the food and the President of the Native American Student Union came over and says, "Dr. Trimble, you should be in line!" I said, "I'm not an elder." And he said, "oh yes you are!" I kind of looked at myself. So I get up to the line and I'm at the back. So as this is often the custom we started asking, "well how old are you?" Caroline Barcus (inaudible ). And… And… And somebody will say, well I am so and so and so and so and pretty soon I found myself moving up the line to the way well I was at the head of the line. And I'm looking back at these old people and I'm saying, I guess I am an elder, so… so you're absolutely correct, it's not… it's… it's something that’s defined I think culturally. We… We knew that our dear friend and colleague Joe would ask us this question and actually I… I have a lot of information and I could say we all are deeply indebted to our elders, because as we all reflect back on where we grew up and how we grew up and who was around us, there was somebody. And indeed in my life there was a particular grandfather not… not to say that my other 80 some cousins and aunts and uncles and so forth and so on didn’t have an impact on life and they did in some ways that I care not to talk about. But there was one and his name was, we called him Grandfather Sage and he dropped out of high school, excuse me, he dropped out of school six years old to work in the field, to pick corn and help his family. So he didn’t have a formal education yet. I have to tell you that if we're not for him, I would not be sitting on this stage today. For he was the one who told my parents that it didn't matter whether I was going to be the first of 80 some ancestors and children to go to college much less graduated high school, but that he wanted me to go. And I remember the day vividly when he… he told me that, because I had… even though I had an athletic scholarship it didn’t matter, we didn’t have any money. And he said to me one day during one of our long walks and I'll talk about that. He said "I understand you… you… you have some sort of scholarship to go play football on track in college." And I said, "yes I did." And that, "Your parents won't let you go?" And I said, "Yes, that’s right". And he stopped me in the field just outside of this little farm and he looked at me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, "you go, I'll take care of your mom and dad, but I want you to make a promise to me." He said, "every time you come home, when you come home, I want you to bring your books with you. And I want you to sit down and I want you to tell me what did you learn and then I wanna learn from you what you're learning." Now I don’t know what this psychology thing is, but I'm really curious about it and I… I… And he said, "I also want you to write me a letter every once in a while." And I did and I stayed true to that. He lived to be 98 years of age and in all honesty he was the wisest man that I… I ever knew. There are several things, I've written about this in past it was my so-called history and it wasn’t easy about, we would often go out to… to his farm and we would often go for a walk after dinner. And he would say to, and I remembered him saying, "stop and look closely of what's going on around you. Listen carefully to the sounds of the birds, the wind, the noise in the air, and… and take in all the aromas and fragrances of the life that surrounds you." He would say this in a very quiet and gentle manner. And as we took these walks through the rows of trees and the streams and the sage brush, he would often stop and gently nod out his chin, like that, which is sort of an Indian gesture of pointing and with a sshhh, and we'd all quiet down and then he'd say, "pay real close attention, because you're going to see something wonderful happen right in front of you." And we knew that he was essentially much more than… than we were. But we played very close attention to his admonitions and his words of wisdom. And I remember him saying repeatedly to… to us, and not just necessarily me although I often felt that he was just talking with me personally. And he would say, "you must look and… and think about what you're looking at, ask questions when you can but… but don’t be too pushy and too nosy. Make sure you run all the things before your eyes and heart before you jump to conclusions, because you may hurt some soul with your choices. And remember that all things have souls and spirits even though you can't see 'em." You know, growing up I… I didn’t really think about those words a whole lot, you just kind of listen to them and you knew that since he was an elder and he was your grandfather you… you paid attention to him and you certainly were obedient. But it only in later life as I reflect back on that to those words have even more meaning… deeper meaning to me. One day we were talking about psychology, it was during Christmas break. And he was looking at me and then looking away and he said, "well, Joey," that’s what they called me when I was little, "so there are really three kinds of people in this world of ours. Yesterday people, today people, and tomorrow people and psychology tries to explain who they are and why they do things." Uh! I thought to myself that this is amazing, because as I reflected back on just the number of courses that it had, folks that live in the past, folks that live now and folks that live for tomorrow, and I'd never forgotten those words, because when I look at the whole theory of personality and so forth and so on and I look at people's lives, it can pretty much be summed up in those little words. He gave me additional advice, "never forget where you came from and lessons you learned in childhood. You know you have a responsibility to pass along your knowledge, experiences and skills and ways that are non-threatening yet informative and always remember that no one has ever accomplished greatness by themselves." He also reminded us that we should value our relationships with our family, with our friends and our colleagues and where possible invite them to participate in our work. I've always valued collaboration and find that most of the time we benefit intellectually, emotionally and dare I say spiritually from the ventures. Sometimes when I'm working alone late in the night or very early in the morning, I feel the presence of others sitting next to me guiding my thoughts in my fingers as they move across the keyboard. During those moments I… I feel a oneness with the world and the life worth that flows in and through all things. Once in a while, I'm reminded of the words of Lohman(ph) a late 19th century Lakota healer, who reportedly said, "I've never seen that in any great undertaking it is not enough for a man to depend simply upon himself. I live in a world, we live in a world, that places a high premium on… on individual invention and individual scholarship. Yet, will I may be the sole author of a number of my writings. I'm continually conscious of the fact that I have never done anything solely and totally about myself. Someone or something influenced my thinking and in acting in that way to lead me to another level, to another idea, to another place." I could say more about what I learned from my elders, because there are many others who contributed to who I am and what I am and what I profess and what I believe and what I value. And I honor them, but time does not permit me to give them the respect that… that they… they do. 

00:30:55
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Professor Trimble. Who would like to go in next? 

00:31:05
JEAN LAU CHIN The… I think what Joe says, I could relate to. I woke up one day and my husband and I have been married almost 40 years and I looked at him and I said, "Gee, I didn't realize I married an old man!" So the… I think some of the stories about elders is one that I've actually chronicled in my book, I was learning from my mother's voice which is published by TC Press here. And it is indeed her voice that I hear and that has guided me. And I'd like to share two anecdotes, memories that I have from my childhood in terms of hearing from my elders that reflect I think two dimensions. One from my mother is words that I heard repeatedly, but you need to remember that she grew up in at the turn of the century, not this century, last century and that the things were different then in terms of women's roles and in terms of many dimensions of racism and other kinds of things. And one thing she always said to me was she had a sixth grade education. And in those days coming from China, she was considered, it was not a typical, that was average. So that she valued the education and she would always say to me, "get a good education, because you will be independent and will not have to depend on a man." Now that says a lot in terms of the context as I said in which she grew up, in which women's roles were only allowed expression, we are being behind a man and… and so on. So that those words were the ones she repeatedly said to me and it emphasized the issue of independence and it emphasized the issue of being myself and doing, you know, things. The other story that I think helps… that I recall is not so much from my mother but some elders around in the community. And again, these were typically men who were… were… had come from the villages in China, farming villages and were typically laundry workers in the United States, because there was no other option in terms of occupation, because of language, because of other economic factors and so on. Because the majority of the elders in my time growing up paid 90% were laundry workers and laundry owners. What I would always hear them say and I heard it differently, I think when I was younger than I do now, which is, they would think about their circumstances, the struggles, the poverty that they went through, the experience of discrimination and so on. But yet they were here to make… make a difference for the next generation, for their children. And they were… But what they would always say is, "all you have to do is look in the mirror and you will know." And what they were talking about is the sense of unfairness and equity and the sense that there is not an opportunity here, because of our race and because of what we're looked at. And it wasn’t just one person saying it, many. And these were the men who've often had… these are the ones who had the fortitude to… to immigrate, to struggle, to work, but also the sense of… of some helplessness. But it is those that also… It is also those words that also gave me the strength and to encourage me to feel that, no this is something we need move pass and we need to move on so that… So those are two anecdotes that I think I recall from my childhood. 

00:35:25
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you very much. Who'd like to go? 

00:35:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM For me, I think following Dr. Chin, my mother comes to mind as certainly as first elder, because the socialization that a mother gives a child growing up in the context of America that framed what it was like for a African-American woman, single parent, raising four kids by herself was quite a challenge, but one of the pieces that probably sticks out most for me as I recall that this morning is the necessity to negotiate the pathway to productivity and success by having to be twice as good to get half as far. I assume not supposed to have received that advice from my elders. As I think back to all of the people who have influenced my life in this kind of profound ways and elders, I go all the way back to ancient (inaudible ) days and I look at… at the pharaoh Ramses and… and the pharaoh Hatshepsut, who at that point was probably the baddest sister on the planet. You know, I think about Koroma(ph), the first African Head of State to be received as a leader of an African nation at the United Nations. I think about W.E.B Dubois. I think about Martin King and Malcolm X and the synthesis between that… that tension that is so pervasive in the African American community about the best way to achieve liberation and social progress, about integrationist versus nationalist ideologies. I think about my mentors, the god father of… of the African psychology movement Dr. Joe White and Horace Mitchell and Janet Helms. And the fundamental lessons I think that they taught me and that I learned from all of those people can be summed up I think in… in four or five brief bullets. The first, there's a saying in our community that says that existence has a face on every side and every face teaches a lesson. And those of us that truly understand existence do not separate the faces from the lessons say the knowledge (inaudible ). The challenge is not simply to embrace the faces that you see in caricatures or in books but to go from the surface structure to the deep structure to find out what are the fundamental lessons that they teach that transcends space and time, that particular piece I think for me it was essential. And so I've learned from my ancient (inaudible ) elders was some of you call ah… Egyptian elders that adulthood in the society is very different, because now we grant privilege based on age. So when I'm 14 - I get a work permit, 16 - I can drive, 18 - I can vote, 21 - I can drink and gamble. For the elders in African tradition, manhood and womanhood were not defined by age but rather were defined by mastery. So the central question in my life has always been, child what have you mastered? You know, and as I continue in my life's journey it's always about that notion of mastery. Second, there is a European principle that is called ori-ire, it's spelt "ORI-IRE" and you'll see it sometime reflected in… in my writing. But literally translated it means, one whose consciousness is aligned with one's destiny. A part of what that is helping me to really grapple with, is trying to understand what is my life's trajectory and how do I try to align my intellect, my emotion, my behavior, with what the elders and ancestors have laid out for me in terms of the contribution that they expect me to make while my unique time and spaces here on this planet? A third for me and most profound I think is probably the notion of spirit and spirituality and the idea that each of us is the manifestation of the divine force in the universe so there's nothing I do, nothing I say, no… you know, moment I occupy in the space and time that is not connected to the creator and the divine force and the universe. And so I always try to make sure that I live reflecting that and relatedly is the African principle of consubstantiation, literally translated meaning that elements of the universe are of the same substance as I… as I recognize the divinity in me so too do I recognize the divinity in all brothers and sisters of color, which has really contributed to that whole multicultural perspective that I've tried to embrace in African(ph) form. I think fifth is the notion of… of fundamental lesson Joe White taught me, which is with all the things that go on in life, it is hard to be a young African American male or female within the context of the racist society. But also learn from a (inaudible ) that you cannot relate to a global world with a local identity. So fundamentally what he taught me was that, white supremacy is not local but global. It is worldwide and the ability to have people's perceptions contaminated almost anywhere you come from in the world is… is very hard. And so what it reminds us to do is that, the challenge that we will live in an oppressive society is really an observation of the way things are. The real challenge for us and for me in my life has been, how do I allow people to take my power by allowing them to define and frame the discourse? Power is always the ability to define reality and to make other people respond to that definition as if it were their own. Put it very simply, my first mentor Joe White, who has really been a… a kind of father to me as well, one of the first lessons he taught me is that you cannot seek validation from your oppressor. So, the challenge was not simply that you live in an oppressive life that there are things in the academy, there are things in life, there are things in corporate America, there are things in almost every walk of life that you will have to struggle with. The challenge is, do you worry so much about what other people think that along the way you lose fundamentally who you are at the core of your being and lose sight of that? And that has really helped me to stay still. On top of which I think I have a… a king-in philosophy that… that manages that but lots of Malcolm in me too. I also share birthday with Nat Turner by the way, so you wonder where my warrior spirit comes from. At last I'll say what a… what a… what an honor to be on the panel with my colleagues here. And when I first got invited to the panel and it was like the elders panel, I wanted to say, who you're calling an elder? That was also true I think in my culture. We have a word that is called (inaudible ). When you rise to the level irrespective of age of being an (inaudible ), it means that you have gained a level of respect for both the contribution that you've made and for the work that you've done and that if I can be and have been an healing presence in the lives of other people either through my instruction, through my mentorship, through my writing, then I will be proud owning that title, so I thank you for honoring me about being in elders panel. 

00:43:45
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother! 

00:43:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Those are the lessons I've learned. 

00:43:50
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother! (Inaudible )? 

00:43:55
MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ I'm going! 

00:43:55
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Okay! 

00:43:55
MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ When I looked at this question the immediate thing that came to mind was the grassroots political activism that my parents were involved in a little old small town in… in central Texas, San Marcos, Texas. And it's interesting because you're exposed to things as a child and a young person that you don’t really realize what impact it has on you until later when you look back. But what happened in my parent's lives is that my father was a veteran of World War… World War II and Hector P. Garcia, who was a physician in corpus noted that Mexicans, Mexican Americans, Latinos were not allowed to join the veterans organizations after World War II they were discriminated against. So he established a… what's called the American GI Forum, which I don’t know where they got that name from, I just grew up with it. So my parents were founders of that. They helped… They had a ladies auxiliary, what it was called at the time. They changed the name later to make it a little more equitable. But… So both my parents were involved in that. And what that veterans organizations did, it had two purposes. It promoted education for young people and both my parents had six grade educations as well and neither of them had gotten past, got even into high school. And it also promoted political activity. And so, both my parents, but my mother in particular, was very active politically at the local level. I can remember when you used to have to pay a poll tax in order to vote. You have to buy, you have to buy a poll tax. And I was a very little girl, but I remember when that was done away with. It was declared unconstitutional. And so she was so happy. She was sure that that was going to change the world. And she proceeded to election after election. She would take those sample votes and go house-to-house to encourage people in the community, in our community to vote and recommend who to vote for. And I was a tiny little girl who'd go with her. And sometimes we would win and sometimes we wouldn't. But what I learned from her was you keep trying, you keep trying. And when we have our representatives, it makes the difference and sometimes it did and sometimes it didn't. But one of the things I learned from her was persistence. You keep trying, you keep trying, you get discouraged but you keep trying. That's sort of an inherent optimism that was involved in that. The… The other message that… that I think I got, well, there are several messages there. One is persistency. Other is being politically active, because it makes a difference. And the other thing I got from my father, which was, he was a very easygoing, very unconditionally loving father. And so he would say, "so what are you… what are you studying?" When I was in graduate school, he would say, "What… What you do?" And so I would explain my first 13 years of work where at the university counseling center. And I said, "Well, dad, I teach courses and I… I counsel people." And he would say, "What you do?" I said, "It was like giving advice and then I consult with faculty and student organizations and I do programming. I do psycho education. This is what I… the kinds of things I teach people about and everything else." And the next time I would see him, he would say, "How is the teaching?" The only thing that he could relate to in terms of what I did, but the message was always as long as you're happy, you know, as long as you're happy. So the message was always… His version of follow your bliss, do what makes you happy. And I think that… that was a very powerful message and I think that I learned that. You know, Joseph Campbell, the philosopher says that, but my father said it first to me anyway. He said it to me and I think all those messages have combined to really blaze a trail for me that I followed. 

00:48:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Well, you know, in… in thinking about sort of injunctions that you get from your family early on, the one that always came to me or there are a couple and they're actually kind of comical. But one of them was… was very serious and I think it's affected my behavior all my life, which is that you never forget where you came from. And for my family, that meant that you came from the North… the North End, which was the other side of the tracks. And so, you know, my father would… I can remember even when he was… there was a period of time where he was fairly successful and when he… even then there was always something about him being working… growing up looking poor that he never forgot. And it was almost like he was always awkward in… in the few times that he was ever in any affluent settings. The other one is that the importance of… of giving back and contributing. And the way that… that I, you know, sort of operationalized that in my life is… was a struggle, because, you know, as you've said that your parents had limited education, my mother did go, graduate from high school. But I was… And my father after the war through the G.I. Bill did attend junior college, but he never completed anything, he went into business. But my mother was very smart. And she would take the test for my father, because he was in the Air Force Reserves and she got him promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, okay. And he would be so nervous when this test time would come, because he'd give her the packet and he'd say, "okay, this is the date it has to be mailed in." And she would just procrastinate, procrastinate and it will be the day… the day before, and he keeps saying, "How are you doing? What are you doing? And you know, how is it coming?" And she… And so finally it would be like the day that it needed to be mailed in, he'd be so anxious and so upset that, you know, and it would get mailed in and he would get promoted again. But the thing about it was that the image I always have or the memory is waking up and seeing my mother reading, because she really educated herself. So if in the middle of the night you want a glass of water or something, I always knew where. The light would be on and she would be reading. And she wanted this. So, you know… And she was just curious about a lot of things, but she regretted or she had a hope that, you know, we would ask her, "What about going to college now?" Because she could have later on and she would say, "No, I'm too older. I feel… I don’t feel, you know, comfortable with it." But she would constantly be educating herself. So when it came time for me to go to school, my father said, you know, "If there is one person that I can… if I could only help one of my children go to college, it would be you." Me, and I'd say, "Why is this?" And he said, "Because then if you end up in a bad marriage, you don’t have to take any, you know, junk from a man." And I think I kind of live that script a little bit too. But anyway, the issue is that they had a struggle about me going away to school, because from my mother's perspective if I went to college, I would… I would move away, I mean, far away. And her mother, you know, my grandmother lived just four blocks away and every morning when we were getting ready to go to school, she was at the kitchen table having coffee and seeing us off to school. That was her image of what she wanted to continue to do. So it's really difficult. So I would hear them, you know, discussing this, you know, between the two of them and finally they… they did let me go. But I think what happened to me in that, was seeing a very bright person who had thwarted dreams. She died at 52 and I can remember the summer before she passed away, she was telling me that she had this illness and… and that it might just happen someday. And so… And she was reflecting on her life and I said, "Was there anything that you regret?" And of course it was that she didn’t go to the college. So… So what I did is as soon as I graduated from college, I ended up trying to apply for a job on the Turtle Mountain Reservation. And I remember seeing the classroom where I might teach… I was to teach language arts and art. And I went into the classroom and there was only one set of books in there and it was the same set of language arts texts that I have had 15 years earlier. And I said to myself, this, you know, I… So what I did is I just dedicated my life to the idea of trying to teach so that people who had a lot of barriers and hesitation about going on to school would hopefully get there. 

00:53:25
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Let me personally ask the audience a question. How many of us feel they're still looking for that connection to our indigenous roots and searching for that strength in our ancestors? Is anyone in that process of searching? Okay, let… let… that leads us to our next question. And now I'd like to just invite one person to answer each of the next questions. We hear, we witness, how your elders have been able to tap the strength, the resources of your indigenous… indigenous ancestry, your roots. What advice can you give us, the audience, in terms of us searching to tap that strength as for those who do not feel culturally active, who may be fourth or fifth or sixth generation here in the U.S.? What are some concrete practical steps that you can provide us in terms of finding our connections to our indigenous strength? 

00:54:10
JEAN LAU CHIN I would like to speak to that, because the book that I wrote "Learning From My Mother's Voice", the message to that is create, all families have a story. They all have a story. They all have a history, you know, as many of us have spoken about. You know, and so I framed it in the way of creating your own family the legend. And that is something that to help to nurture, to heal. And in writing the book that I wrote, it didn’t start out as a book, it started out with my mother and I getting together. She would visit me in Boston, I lived in Boston and she lived in New York and she was very hard-of-hearing. And we would talk, you know, but they would talk many times when in… like in… with noisy background she couldn't hear, you know. So I would ask her to tell me stories, you know, tell me about. And she… That's how she started to tell me the stories that I chronicled. I had heard some of them already and we did that for ten years. And I found that the more I asked, I started to record them because I couldn't remember them, the more she was productive. And I learned a lot in terms of my background and I learned it differently, because I was now an adult as compared when I was a child. And it was meaningful because after ten years, she was actually… she was killed in a car accident and it was very traumatic for all of us, you know. And it was upon that that I decided to put these stories together in a book to honor her and to recall all of that. And in writing the book, it was a healing experience for me to put that altogether, you know, and I actually published the book ten years on the anniversary of her death. You know so that… So I think the message is… You know, there were many contradictions, you know, in some of the things and relating that to that, I think many of us spoke to is the fact that my parents were always very proud of the accomplishments and the education and all the things that I did. They didn't always understand it. So like what Melba was talking about, they couldn't. So there were two things. One was, when I was going to major in psychology, my mother said to me, "What are you gonna major? What are you gonna major?" Trying to explain it all in Chinese, which I didn't have the words for, you know, in psychology, so I have to explain how you study the mind and so on. And she said, "Ah…Ah…", finally, "you're gonna be a brain surgeon." 

00:57:05
[sil.] 

00:57:10
JEAN LAU CHIN And then the other part of it was that when I published one of my first books with Victor De La Cancela and we were talking about, you know, how we would share with our parents and… You know, both our parents don’t speak English, you know, so his… his parent… his mother is Puerto Rican and mine Chinese. And he finally said to me, as we said, "They don’t really understand what this is all about." So Victor said to me, "Chin, just…" and that's what he said, he told his mother is, "Just put it on your coffee table and that was really what was all about is to know that exists." You know, you don’t have to read it and… and so on, but to know that this is an accomplishment. 

00:57:55
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you sister Chin. Is there anyone else who wanna add… add a concrete suggestion for how to tap into the strengths of our indigenous ancestors? 

00:58:00
MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ I can… I can… Well, you know, my answer to… And I have a couple of stories too. But my answer to that is immersion, immersion into your cultural roots. It's… It's like you can do that in a multitude of ways, everything from going to festivals, to talking to some of your elders, just spending time with them, to going home if home is where, you know, your… your culture exists, talking to people. One of the… Because I grew up in a small town, I didn't realize fully how, you know, Hillary Clinton said "It Takes A Village", how that village really had such a powerful input. I went to high school in the… in the late 60's and that was about the time that there were things happening the country around racial awareness and so on. And so in my small town in San Marcos High School, the African-American, the Blacks and the Latinos got together and started block voting for student elections and things in high school. So many of us started taking leadership in… in the community high school and there was community support among the then elders, which I… I didn’t fully realize but there were. I mean, you know, every time some new election came up at the local dances, you know, which show up at the local dances, because in the Latino community, you have multigenerational dances at least we're used to and they would be so happy patting us on the head and say, "you go, that's good." And that made such a huge difference. My… I have to backup a little bit and say, I'm the oldest of seven children and my parents are each the oldest of eight and nine children, which a huge family. You know, how many cousins I have? It's huge. It's just a huge family. I… I joke about how… When my grandmother was dying, there was sort of a… a special dinner that we had for her one day with only close family and a few close friends, so only about a hundred people were there. So it's huge. You know, that's… that's a village in and of itself. But beyond that, you know, there were the local politicians, the local mayor, the local Latino mayor, the first local Latino mayor. When I was in graduate school, my mother got a bachelor's degree. She did… She did go back and she got a bachelor's degree. Well, she got her GD and then she got her bachelor's degree and she was Director of a community action program, which was part of the war on poverty, LBJ's war on poverty. And she retired about a dozen years ago and she… Last fall, I attended the opening of Centro Hispano Cultural, which is a Hispanic cultural center for Latinos that my mother organized and developed, you know, got grants and funding and got a team together to do it. And so, here is now a cultural center which San Marcos didn't have. And she asked me to come and speak at that, you know, for five minutes at the grand opening and that was when I really, I mean, I was in tears, I'm gonna start crying again, because I saw some of the people who have died, but the pictures of all the leaders in the community when I was growing up were there and some of them were still there, you know, they're 70's and 80's and… and just still patting me on the head and that felt so good. And so that level of immersion, which I had not really participated in a long time. I'd go home, visit my family, but not move out into the community very much. And so I really encourage people to find ways to do that, because that was just such a special gift for you. 

01:01:50
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you sister Melba. Brother Thomas you wanted to add? 

01:01:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah, I would… Staying with the Melba's cultural immersion, I would echo that with… with a couple of qualifiers. Immersion is absolutely a sentiment to the culture. But one strategy I would invite you to consider is to always remember to distinguish between personality and principle so that a lot of people who embrace the personalities of folk, who are kind of the… the… the social characteristics that you see, but having really understood the principles that folk live by, (inaudible ). How many folk would believe one of my heroes is Martin Luther King? How many folks believe Martin Luther King might have been a hero for America? Anybody? Let me see? Keep your hands up for a second. How many people have read Strength to Love? Take a look around the room. How many people have read Why We Can't Wait? How many of us have read his letter from the Birmingham jail? Okay, a few more. The idea is that we have lots of heroes and heroines that we worship. But we look at the personality rather than the principle, which you've got to do is go from the surface structure to the deep structure. Second, what I would say is you have to avoid what Wade Nobles used to call, still calls, the pitfalls of scientific colonialism. So that as we engage in… in immersion, particularly into reading, scientific colonialism is really about the political control of knowledge and the three elements to that, that you have to be careful about, one is the unsophisticated falsification, where you have history and facts that are distorted (inaudible ). The second is the integrated modificationism. I think, our discipline of psychology is probably the best example of that. So it's like turning an hourglass on its side where you take a known construct running through a different cultural filter and what comes out on the other side is the distorted image of what it was originally intended to be. It's like psychology for the ancients was about the study of the soul or the spirit and it runs through your centric cultural filters and what comes out as a study of the mind and a study of human behavior. And now we're forcing ourselves to have to find a way to integrate spirituality back into psychology. We confuse it with religiosity, alright. And it's amazing to see that when all you have to do is go back to the original source and find out what really spirit was about, that you can find in all the indigenous traditions that we represent on the stage. Third I would say that remember that as you immerse yourself into the culture, into the elders, that the reservoirs of wisdom, in my opinion, are not necessarily with what I would call the disease (inaudible ). Let me say that again. We certify people as being smart and scholarly and worldly based upon degrees we give them. If I wanted to learn something about relationship… I… I… I was watching an image one time of advertising a book on TV from a woman who had a Ph.D. And looking at the background, this is the woman who've been divorced three times writing a book on being a relationship expert. But it was an expert because they had a Ph.D. and now you got a book pub. If I wanna learn about relationship, I'm not going to do Ph.D. who've been divorced three times, I'm going to the elder who might be a genitor, the elder who might be the maid, the elder who might be the cook, the elder who might be something, but (inaudible ) together 40, 50 years and have something to teach you about how to go through the ups and downs of adversity but still keep on keeping on. You know that's where the reservoirs of wisdom are… are relegated to not necessarily into the means of spaces. So those are three concrete things I would suggest to all of you. 

01:05:45
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother Thomas. 

01:05:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE I guess, I would like to add that I don’t think it's never too late to learn about your culture and… and indigenous ways. And I… I'm happy to be in an institution right now that really supports that. There are 300 native students at Stanford and a number of native Hawaiian students and now we're beginning to get students from Samoa and Tonga. But the atmosphere is one that when people come there, if they… because many students are very bright and they maybe grew up in suburbs or some good proportion from reservations but not as many as maybe we would like. And so there it's… there is an awkwardness between the students that has… have really been steeped in their culture and then those that are, you know, they have the DIB cards and all this, but you know they are native people but they don’t necessarily know and so it's a lot and so we've really worked a lot at having more cultural exchanges and trying to have an atmosphere that in… at a university setting, it's okay for that to be happening. And I do think it's never too late. I mean, with my mother, my mother had grew up in a very… you know, we lived in the small town of southern Indiana and towards the end of her life when she, you know, was thinking about this a lot more personally, she was taking me to places like the Miccosukee celebration in Florida with my granddaughter and any place that she could go, it's like she was just sort of like trying to take it all in and it was so nice to see how happy she was that at that… even at that point in her life, she was being really nourished by, you know, her background. 

01:07:35
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you sister Teresa. We're gonna try one more question and then we're going to open it up for interaction with you all audience. We have other questions that (inaudible ) will come back to. But our final question for this stage of our… our discussion is the following. Your elders, how have indigenous and other support systems helped you navigate the web of racism, sexism, homophobia, other 'isms' that still pervade society including our own theos of psychology and education? Who'd like to address that? 

01:08:10
[sil.] 

01:08:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Well, I… I could. I think, oh, Joe was going to… In… In… In my reflecting on a lot… lot of this, I think it's always, I would be in an awkward situation because people would say what you really experience racism, you know, and… or sexism, not question for racism. And I would feel… I would… I would say, yes I've had a number of experiences that were almost very much modern racism in terms of the way the people would do their various little things. And it appeared to me that what… what I always thought… To me what was important was to just get the grounding of people that are so used to it that they're looking at me like, what's wrong with you that you're even bothered by us, right? And also, not to say we should accept it, but so what? And you just keep moving on, okay. The other area is that I think it's really important to have networks and organizations. And to me I think… I don’t think I would have made it through academia if it hadn't been for being connected to APA, through… you know, being on the MFP, you know, selection board or whatever you call that advisory board and BEMA and then Division 45, because I met people that, you know, that weren't in competition and that were freely willing to share how they manage certain things when these difficulties would occur. 

01:09:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM For me I think there are two fundamental principles that have got me kind of navigate that. The first and the best I've heard it put was the famous psychiatrist Frances Cress Welsing one day talking about some of the work of Neely Fuller, who simply said "if you don’t understand racism and White supremacy, what it is and how it functions, everything else you think you understand will only confuse you." As soon as they said that, it was like the light bulb, like the… because part of what they're really talking about is that, that oppression in any form, race, gender, sexual orientation, class, ability, disability, oppression is on a natural human phenomenon. It is not natural to oppress people. But what it also does is it instigates unnatural human behavior in those people who are most victimized by it. It's a part of what we always have to be cognizant of these ways in which we have been impacted by, contaminated by the vestiges of racism, sexism, you know, blah, blah, blah. So that part of the good pieces is… is really important. But what… what I would also share with… with our audience and other folk in there, Joe Trimble and I were just talking about this actually before we began. And that current generation sometime have what I would call a low frustration tolerance. We come out of generations where it would cost our elders their life to know how to read. If they caught any of us knowing how to read and our parents knowing how to read and their parents knowing how to read, there was a consequence to pay some time with your life and now we got to deal with the professors. They don't like us in the classroom, there might be little racist and we go bizarre, you know. So on… on my wall, behind my head I keep a picture of the ancestors in the slave dungeons in Ghana, you know, (inaudible ) in a place I've been. It's… It's profound. You know, I keep a picture of Malcolm on the other wall. And it always reminds me to contextualize struggle. So whenever I think I got it bad, whenever I think stuff is like, ooh, this is bad, I look at that and go, you know what, but an alien slave ship. And if they could get through that, all of us in our ability to highlight whatever (inaudible ) we might have was made possible by people who came along (inaudible ). And so what we owe is a debt and what we owe is… is… is the responsibility to have the emotional immense of fortitude to be able to (inaudible ) adversity. So the question really about, we were talking about spirit and spirituality yesterday with anybody's assistance. Whenever you have spirituality, the duality of that says that there are always instances of… of the unjustified suffering, a merited pain and undeserved harm. The stuff happens is inevitable. The question for us is always how do we sustain some… some movement or momentum in the face of that adversity? So for me, I try to contextualize struggle as long as I remember in an alien slave ship, I can keep on keeping on. 

01:13:30
MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ Let me… I… I'd would like to respond to that, because I want you to know that there is no way I could have negotiated my way to be President of APA without experiencing racism and sexism and socioeconomic, you know, discrimination and so on, classism. And so, you know, absolutely even attending this conference adds to the foundation of confidence and strength among us. And, you know, I also resonate to your comments, to Thomas, because you know Maya Angelous says, "We all sit in the shoulders of those who've gone before us." I'm paraphrasing. "And people have shed blood, sweat, and tears for us to be where we are today, each and every one of us." And people we didn't even know, people we don’t even know and we have to… we are all here because we want you to stand on our shoulders. And I'm willing to do that on the condition that you then lend your shoulders and put a hand back to help others, because you know what is not going to be over anytime soon. And one of the things that I have learned along the way is very interesting, because you know, because I've been around APA for over 30 years. I've… I've initially found people that I'd scratch their names out, you know. But then you know what? After a few years something happens and I had to go back and erase that line, 'cos you never know when someone who appears to be absolutely racist or sexiest might turn around may be just on one occasion or two to do something supportive or that's, you know, turns them into an ally or maybe they learn something along the way. So I… I… I guess what I'm saying is don’t think about these events or experiences in dichotomist terms, black and white, everything is relativistic. You know, I mean, there are a few people, don’t get me wrong, who I'll never trust. But… But there are people who are confused and who haven’t learned yet and who are coming out of their own experiences who have the capacity to learn and so that… that sort of another… another lesson. One final thing that I wanna say has to do with the whole… I want you to be willing to take risks even in the face of adversity, because if you don’t take risks, you don’t know what you can do. And remember that we have learned in this past decade that capacity and intelligence is… is… is incremental, you can increase it, even into old age. We can develop skills. We can get more credentials. We can take those risks. What happens sometimes because of stereotype threat, you know, Claude Steele's work where if we make a mistake in a field or we're afraid to make a mistake in an area where there is… two typic… negative things about us, you know, we sort of block and we… we sort of, you know, develop some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, because we get so anxious about it. But we have to learn to get pass that and to push pass that and remember that we can have the capacity. So we have to take risk in order to prove to ourselves as well as to others that we can move on and we can accomplish what we want to. 

01:17:10
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Melba. 

01:17:10
JOSEPH TRIMBLE I would like to take another approach to this and (inaudible ). John told me a story a long time ago. You may remember, and privileged me with the honor of telling the story at a conference. May I tell that story? And it's been substantiated by my dear friends from (inaudible ). I believe you helped me out with this. When I look at the history of humanity, I… I see a trail of… of hatred, a trail of war, a trail of disaster, but I also see goodness coming from… from a lot of that, where people step in and say, enough is enough. The story that was passed along to me goes like this. A long time ago, in an area we now call Montana, every year these two bands would get together and they would fight. And they would line up and one side line up on the other and they would glare at each other and they would threaten each other and they would insult one another and they would shake their lances and they would shake their bows and they would shake their shields and they would do other improper but nothing less insulting things to taunt the enemy and then they would go at it and people would die. And then the battle would usually go on for days and days and then it would stop. Then they would return to their villages and heal the wounded and grieve for the loss of those who died in battle. Well, as John told me no one knows how long this went on but it went on all the time at the same time of the year. And so it happens that on one occasion the favorite son of the chief, of one of the bands was killed. And his heart was broken. And when he carried the body back to the village to prepare it for the spirit royalty, then gathered the elders together in a large, usually would put three or four teepees together. And he sat with them and he said, "we have to end this. This cannot go on anymore. We don’t know why every year we line up and we fight with one another." And they talked about it and there was a lot of dissention, because others had lost the lives of their relatives and/or had been injured in those battles. And so there was a lot of tension and a lot of hatred, but he prevailed and he stayed with them day after day after day until there was consensus. So that time of the year came around and he gathered together three of his trusted warriors and told him… told them to go to the other village and tell the chief that we want to end this. So they left and went on their many-day journey to the other village and when they approached it from the outside there were things that they did in those days to announce that they were friendly and you didn’t just necessarily walk in and say I'm here. And… And people came out from the village, warriors, they were tensed. They… There was a lot of hostility, they knew who they were. And these three gentlemen men said why they were there and so they were invited into the village and they met with the elders and they sat with them. And the discussion was heated and tensed. A lot of anger, a lot of hatred, but the chief of that village realized that this had to come to an end because he too had lost his son in this battle. So he said, "you go back and you tell your chief that we agreed. But we will meet on those war grounds." So the day came and, you know, the camps moved and set up cabinets on either side of this sort of invisible line, and of course the warriors were all lined up with the women behind them providing them with support and it was tense. The tension could have been cut with a knife. And finally the chief of the one village took off the shield, took off his quiver put his bow down, put his knife down on the ground and made it very apparent that he had done that and he took off his war bonnet and he walked out to the centre of the arena such as it was. The other chief did the same thing. He took off his war bonnet and put down his shield, put down his knife, put down his lance, and walked forward. And I wanna show you what they did so I'd stand up rather. They were staring at one another and of course you can just imagine what this was like. The hatred, the tension that had gone on for who knows how long, but finally the chief went like this. You're my brother.

01:23:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM You're my brother. 

01:23:55
JOSEPH TRIMBLE And that’s what they did. And because they were now related, they could no longer fight one another. And that’s the story as that was told to me. The Lakota believed that we'… everyone believed this, it's not just particular to the Lakota people, the allies, that everyone is related to everyone else, that we're all connected to one another. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we acknowledge that connection in a way that embraces who we are, how similar we are, what we're committed to rather than fighting it? 

01:24:50
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother Joseph. 

01:24:55
[sil.] 

01:25:00
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Let's… Let's pause just for ten seconds to feel into our brother Joseph's words and then we'll begin. Just take a few seconds. 

01:25:10

01:25:15
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Dear elders would it be okay now if we met with our brothers and sisters today? 

01:25:20
[sil.] 

01:25:35
JOSEPH TRIMBLE That was the Big Foot. John passed away some time ago. He was a spiritual leader, historian of the southern triathlon(ph), western Oklahoma. He was one of those guys you could sit with for hours. He was full of stories, full of humor, teased you, and you'll add them. He was a wonderful, wonderful man and he was the one who told me that story and asked me to pass it along at a conference and I did. You were there Caroline. A conference where I must admit there was a lot of tension and I would just leave it there. (Inaudible ), thank you very much. 

01:26:40
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother Joseph. We're honored that you're here. We honor your voices and now it's time for us to interact and any question is a good question about any aspect of what we've talked about. About your own ancestry, about your own careers, words of wisdom, struggles, anything… anything you'd like to share or ask, we're really here for you. So we have to microphones set up, so please come up and ask of our elders any question that you'd like to. Yes please. 

01:27:15
KESHE Okay! Hi my name is Keshe(ph) and I'm a first year EdM student in the Psychological Counseling Program here at Teachers College. So, (inaudible ) just reflecting on words of wisdom. Yesterday my mom had said to me that it seems that for me my worth is based on how others view my accomplishments as opposed to who I am as a person. And going back to Dr. Parham's comments about having to be twice as good just to get half as far and also do you worry so much about what people think that you begin to lose yourself. So the question that I'm posing to each one of you is that, how do you or did you begin to live by your own standards of worth? 

01:28:10
JOSEPH TRIMBLE No! I did mean Joe. I was petrified when I was in school. I was absolutely petrified. And I… There was this fear failure that… that lingered and… Okay, I'll tell you the truth. I didn’t date a woman or a man, no, no. I didn’t date anybody until my junior year, because I… I felt like I didn’t have time in my life for that. You know, in the fall it was football practice and getting up at 6 o'clock in the morning and then getting your brain speed out in the afternoon. And on Saturdays and… So then there was class and then studying. And I realized that if I was going to succeed, I had to pay attention to the way others succeeded in this school that I attended. I'm not ashamed to say this, sometimes embarrassed, but I had to put all of that culture, if you know what I mean, in the drawer and close it, because if I… I knew that if I did things the way I knew to do them, I probably wouldn’t have made it. And so there was that voice in the back of my head of my grandfather, "When you come home bring your books. We're very proud of you." And when I went into graduate school, that stayed with me and then something happened and it happened in February of 1964 in William James Hall at the campus of Harvard in the class and personality theory where I raised the question about a professor and I won't say his name. "When are we gonna talk about culture?" Because I happened to know that where I grew up and what I learned, the way that people raise children, the way people relate to children, the way that people relate to adults, the way things are done and the ceremonies, I didn’t go into detail about the sun dance and spirit quest and so forth and so, and sort of danced around that generally. And I was astounded at the comment that I received back, and the comment was, "We don’t have time for it." Well, I kind of half expected that, but when the seminar was over and the snow was falling, he invited me to walk him home and I took him up on that and we had a long talk on his front porch. I don't know why he didn't invite me in. And he said, "I kind of agree with you, but we really don’t have time for this." Well that was the moment when I opened the drawer and I said, it's time to pull this back, to go back to talk to my relatives, to go back to talk to some spiritual leaders from south Dakota and tell them what I had done and they would, sure we understand, that is what you need to do. And… And this is all I'm gonna tell you, don’t ever apologize for it. 

01:32:30

01:32:35
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother Thomas? 

01:32:35
MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ I can make it… Oh go ahead! 

01:32:35
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO (Inaudible ). No, I want you to go first. 

01:32:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM For me I think it's… it's always been a challenge I think to do that so two quickies. One, the whole notion of you can't seek validation from your oppressor was… was profound to me from… from Joe White. But what I've also learned I think in the course of my own development is all of us have been in that space I think where you grow up with very much of an external source of validation if you weigh the scales and almost like Rogers talks about in his self-theory, the older that you get the internal self also have at least as much influence as the external self even if it’s a little bit weighted externally to care about other people. I'm even okay with that. What you don’t want is to be so, you know, internally focused (inaudible ), but you don’t want to be on this side where everybody defines (inaudible ) for you. Fundamentally, what you have to do is distinguish a couple of things. One, there is a difference between what you do for a living and who you are at the core of your being. And the problem is that we live in a society that reinforces that you are what you do, so if you ask people, you know, and whose work I would really invite you to go consider. Particularly, is an African-American woman, but whether you're white, black, blue, brown or purple, it's fine as for now. For now it really invites us to consider that there are three critical questions that I'll be talking about something like this afternoon. Who am I? Am I who I say I am? And am I all I ought to be? And you've gotto be able to interrogate those particular questions, because once you do that you'll discover that at the core of your being you are very different than the material, you know, assets that you are then validated for. I mean, that is fundamental I think to being able to… you know, to answer than ask the questions. The other pieces that graduate school particularly where you are? What… What's your first (inaudible ) you said? I mean, I understand that… that graduate school is not a democracy, that none of us think about that. We say what we say now, but I don’t remember my first paper in graduate school. We had three days to do a ten-page paper. I was a master student at Washington University in St. Louis. So much like my… my elder here who was at… at Harvard, they call themselves the Harvard of the Midwest. In fact, they would really wear T-shirts that says Harvard University as the Washington University of the East. I mean, it was just comical to me to see that the intellectual rivalry. But to get in class where you're talking about culture, now I understand that I come out of that marvelous militancy of the 60's and 70's. You know, I come out of class is where I'm learning about, you know, African psychology and Joe White and you know that kind of stuff as an undergraduate. I come out of just having been mentored and I was selected to be his teaching assistant, so I think I'm pretty well versed on this cultural stuff. Get in class and they invite you to write a ten-page paper on your theory of personality. They didn’t say reflect Rogers, Jung, Freud, Adler, Perls, no your theory. I get the paper back. I get A minus and I'm mad. You know most will be like, whew you know, like I'll be happy to know a heck no I'm not happy with a minus, 'cos my mama was like, you gotto be twice as good. So I'm looking through the paper and the first eight pages, great insight, wonderful point, blah, blah, but the last page and a half which is where all my critique of years(ph) I took psychology was and (inaudible ) and the cultural stuff all kind of red lines, what is this stuff and, you know, they started sort of cursing in the paper but it was kind of like and I won't tell you who the professor was, pretty, pretty, a well known professor. So I had a choice to make. I could either convince that professor of the air of their way in their class. Or I could not lose sight of what, right, the war was, that was an individual battle. The war was what? Get a A! What was the war? Get out of school with my degree. So when I get out of class, big fat A. What did I do? Say, that’s what you wanna hear, fine I'll be glad to take whatever you wanna hear. I got on got a A, came out of Washu, now have a PhD, now they have to pay me big money to go around and say the same stuff they didn’t want me to say in the paper. 

01:37:15
[sil.] 

01:37:20
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Melba? 

01:37:20
MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ Alright! Yeah! Just a couple of comments, 'cos I think you both responded quite well. The development of confidence is a lifelong process, don't forget that. And… And I… I like that balancing thing where we do live in a world that… that… that looks at accomplishments and it's… it's all relativistic and… and there are two things I would recommend, talk to yourself on a regular basis, you know reassure yourself. You really do have to work on those cognitions. Secondly, seek support whenever possible. I remember when I entered I was in an affirmative action, admit into graduate school when I entered the doctorate program at University of Texas at Austin in counseling psychology. And I didn’t know that the average GRE score for admits was like 1275. Well mine was a 1050. So, I remember going to talk to the head of the counseling psychology program one day we had you know regular advisory meetings. He said, "How are you doing?" I said, "Okay!" He said, "What's wrong?" And I said, "Well, I just found out about this average GRE thing and you know and I'm feeling bad." And he said, this… this was, I'm blanking(ph) on his name right now but he was so kind and he said, "You know, I did a little study one day looking at the relationship between high GRE's and the ability to complete the program, there was an inverse relationship." He said, "You're gonna do fine." And so being willing to share my heart and my fears where I felt trust really made a difference as well, so no when and whom to talk to it at times when you're feeling… when you're… when you're feeling the need for support. There was one other point I wanted to make and I can't remember it. I'll come back to it later. 

01:39:10
JEAN LAU CHIN I'll just make a brief comment about that, 'cos this story is already illustrated well, but it's essentially a process and a journey that everyone needs to make. You know, but you need to keep in mind that the underlined foundation is that you need to start with some positive assumptions, you know, and focus on the strengths, because there is so much that comes through that may not be positive, so if you don’t stop at those positive assumptions about the confidence, I can do it or… or you can't face some of the negative ones that come… come about. 

01:39:45
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO How about another question, yes? 

01:39:50
This is addressed to the three women over here, Melba and Jean and Teresa. But Thomas, you mentioned your mother too so it also includes you. I'm wondering whether there is any generational difference in mothers, because I heard the young woman talk about her mother. I have a very similar upbringing as you three women though I come from a totally different society, in fact all four of us come from different societies, but I found a common ground in our mothers. I have a 93-year-old mother who is an immigrant in this society, but she told us three sisters the same thing that we needed to get educated and we needed to become professional women so that we could take care of ourselves and not be so dependent on our husbands, though she definitely wanted us to get married. Definitely I… I remember receiving letters from her while I was already in this country and she would say doctor in parentheses Mrs. (inaudible ). So… So… But, you know, when we were growing up and she was the… the youngest daughter in a very, very large family of sons and daughters and she would tell me stories about her oldest sisters who were devoted wives and mothers but actually had pretty tragic lives, which also included suicide from some of the women, because they were so oppressed in… in their husbands' households, including oppression from mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law and extended family. And my mother never wanted us to experience and she barely had a high school education. And I think Joseph, I resonated very well, because when I would bring my books home from… from undergraduate college my mother would read those books. So I… I'm wondering whether we were brought differently by our mothers. And then I'm also an elder now, so… so that… that… We were really made to believe in ourselves. And very similar to you, Melba my mother when she was in elementary school, she walked in the Salt March with Mahatma Gandhi, so it goes back many, many decades ago and she was also a carrier of revolutionary letters. They never thought a little girl would carry letters from Indian revolutionaries fighting against imperialism. So we three sisters have always been very confident and… and aspired and… and really our self-esteem and self-concept have not been walked on, though we have sometimes felt a little diffident and worried whether we can achieve as much as others. So I don’t know. I mean, if we were brought up differently. 

01:42:50
JEAN LAU CHIN I would like to respond to that in terms of the importance of looking at these experiences in context, because the… my mother and I grew up and were raised in a different era, different generation which is very different from what it is like today. And that context has some significant impact, because women were able or not able to do things that women can do today. And I think that context then makes for, how do we understand that in context? Because I remember being young, I would think or say, you know, why is my mother doing that? And we would be annoyed that she would yield to some of the… the dominance, you know, of… you know, favoritism towards, you know, towards boys, in raising my brother, in my father being dominant the way it was. But what comes through in the statements that I think each of our mothers have said is that, one is that it's… it is as it is, but you also need to learn how to negotiate and manage it, 'cos there are some things, I think that’s inherent in your story, is this the time that you can stand up and say, no I won't do that. You know or do you wait till the right moment, you know and the… the right time. So the context is so critical, but what underlies is what is communicated. The strength, the… the independence you know that my mother communicated and the love that we knew, you know, was there so that those things enable you to say, no I am good enough. But we have to live in the context the we… some of which we can't change right now. 

01:44:55
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Teresa, well Melba your comment? 

01:45:00
MELBA J.T. VASQUEZ Well, I'd just like to know how many women in the audience got the message from your mothers to get educated so you don’t have to depend on a man? They're still getting the message (inaudible ). Yeah, that's very telling. That is… You know, I mean, I think that says a lot. But how many men got that message? 

01:45:25
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Well, I'd like to add that a message that I clearly got from my mother was how important it was to also keep… have a family, that you know you can get caught up in all this professional everything, but in essence it's really your family that’s going to be, you know, your… what's meaningful to you. And so she was always about… also trying to balance it so that you kept your family. Now my father didn’t want me to put up with any negative stuff from a man but she wanted me to keep my family. 

01:45:55
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Okay, thank you! We've got time for one more question, 'cos then we have a little time I don't know who is may be two questions and then we'll wrap up I'm sorry. Thank you. 

01:46:05
LAURIE BROWN My name is Laurie Brown and I'm an undergraduate senior at (inaudible ) College and my question for you is especially in the past few years I've been having a difficult time navigating my way through a primarily white educational institution and I feel the more I learn about systems approach or… the more I learn about all white institutions, the more kick back I get from the institution and I'm just wondering I guess your advice on how to navigate a person like political and professional success within these institutions or in general when your political or personal ideology is at odds with that institution or just the over arching societal institution that we have? 

01:47:05
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you. Is there a particular voice you'd like to hear first? 

01:47:05
LAURIE BROWN No whoever would like to respond. 

01:47:10
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Okay! 

01:47:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM I mean, the… the… the challenge, two quickies I would say because I know we're… we're… we're short on time. The challenge for me again is to not confuse values and skills. Often times the… the… the difficulty for us to navigate that terrain you speak of, has little to do with we don’t know what to do. It is the resistance we feel about wanting to do it, because we feel like in order to engage the academy in the way in which they expect you to comply and to… to assimilate and somehow to sell-out culturally who we are. And part of the distinction you have to make is that there is a difference between the values of your culture and the skills you have to learn to negotiate the pathways to productivity or success. Those are two fundamentally different things. You can develop the skills and technologies, right, of the larger society and not have to compromise your value system at all. Lastly I'll say, within the course of… of doing lots of work I've done in… in… in my career on identity, I have often said that the central challenge for me as an African-American man and for… for half a dozen people and I think it's true for an Indian folk, for a Latino folk, for an Asian folk, for you know white folk really, who live at the marvels of society is how do I maintain a sense of my cultural integrity in a world that doesn't support of from my humanity as a person and then you just fill in the blank in my case is African descent. There is always a line you have to walk. You know, it was the same thing that Dubois talked about in Souls of Black Folk in 1903 when he talked about the two warring idols in one body is the same challenge that… that Ellison talked about in 52 when he wrote Invisible Man. It’s the same thing that that Eames writes about in 1950 when he talks about, you know, in protest (inaudible ) negro form that I got one man for white folks to see another for what I know is me. What's he saying? He's saying that each of us has to be able to negotiate that pathway in a way that it allows you to be on one side and still pick up the skill but not fundamentally lose who you are on the other side. And it doesn’t get any easy about the way, because there is a few of you think it's less of you where you are and wait till you get to this level. Right? There are there are fewer folk, they're the more you get. At some point though you just lose the capacity, right, and say A be afraid hopefully, and we start understanding I think in trying to really be true to that legacy. All of our ancestors remind us I think much like Fernandez(ph) that every generation out of relative obscurity must reach out and seek to fulfill that legacy of betrayal. You got a question. Your question is not do I know what the right thing to do is. Your question is what am I prepared to sacrifice in order to fulfill the legacy that I've inherited so that I can, as… as Dr. Vasquez said, make sure that I reach down and bring all the people there. You're the best of the best. (Inaudible ) University. It's not a slave ship system. 

01:50:15
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you brother Thomas. We have one more question. We have one more question and then we are going to get to the next stage. 

01:50:25
PAT ISAAC Thank you. Actually, this… this is… What your answer is… is actually lead into the flipside of that question is that individuals who have earned their doctorates, earned their masters and… and this is something I tell my own teachers who I… I… I work with as a faculty that your life changes when you get these advance degrees and sometimes the family members who use to love you, somehow… somehow disconnected from you. That frightens some people in our families that you have advance degrees, at least that had been my experience and then certainly has been experienced with some of my… my teachers and as well some of my, you know, former individuals who were in my cohort. So I want you sort of to speak to that. I think that is really important to understand that as we move into these higher levels of degrees that the world will regard us differently. Okay, they'll regard us sometimes negatively from the dominant society. But also they'll regard us and put us in a different status and then all of a sudden I have to think very differently about who I am and what I'm… what I'm… in the moment what I'm doing? Am I being professional in the moment? Am I… Am I going to say something that's not professional? Will that offend that person? Will that offend my college? Will that offend my profession? And… And maybe that's something that we could talk about a little bit, if this has been your experience. 

01:51:40
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO And your name? 

01:51:45
PAT ISAAC I'm sorry, Pat Isaac. 

01:51:45
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Pat, thank you! Who'd like to take that question? So can you just refine the focus of the question and that there's how we get more degrees, it affects our own interactions, our own families? 

01:52:00
PAT ISAAC Right! 

01:52:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM I mean, at some point, it's… it's an easy terrain to navigate if we understand that along with all of the status I think that we have been afforded, there is a response specificity that is expected so that people somehow believe that our behavior will change as a function of, you know, the way we are. One of the most fundamental lessons I think that… that my mother shared with me had to do with being home one day on a visit and the phone rings and somebody says, "Hi, may I speak to Dr. Parham?" And my mother just simply smiled and said, "Which one?" You know, because I have a brother who is also a psychologist and a PhD and, you know, where I was practicing. But my mother was one of the folk who kept you humble. My mother didn't care, you know, she was proud of that, you know she has got two sons with a PhD, a third college educated, nobody on drugs, jail or in a gang. You know, (inaudible ) more than $18,000 a year in 32 years she worked for the government. How do you do it? But the humility of the story is about what she was most impressed by, not that your status is there but she wanted to know some fundamental things. Do you love God and thank God for the ways in which you've been blessed? Do you treat people fairly and nicely? Can you be self-sufficient and support your family? Are you a loving husband? Are you a loving father? I mean, the basic things that were there that had nothing to do with the degree I had. That was the difference between what I did for living and who I am as a person. And what your relatives want to know is not somehow that you got a PhD and got, you know, up in the world, alright, but what they want to know is, can you still be regular people. And… And the folk were no different than… than the Joe White's at the world who first trained me. Joe first grabbed me by the collar. So one of the questions was, how do we get mentored? My mentor found me. And he saw me walking on campus, one day put his arm around me just like, you know, I do with… with Joe. He said, "Young brother, you got too much talent to be (inaudible ) basketball chasing women." He's told, "don’t follow me." You know, follow me, diagram my whole future upon this chalkboard which was like (inaudible ). We use chalkboard back in those days. And when you diagram our future… you're going to do… All these are wonderful things. My eyes are just getting bigger. But the last thing he said to me, sister, he said, "one day you're gonna be a bad model." He's told, "but don't you ever forget to be a basic brother." What was he saying? He was saying that… that much like a king in philosophy that your… your worth will not be judged by how many degrees you get, how many awards you get, how many books you write, it's about what you do for the least of these and how you make a difference in your community. And that's why my life was guided so much by the king in philosophy that says being a drum major it was not about being a front leading a band, it was about being a drum major in terms of… and about service. You know, can you serve others, can you help others navigate that? And if you engage in that level of response specificity, your family has nothing to do but embrace you, it's when we go to the other side when we start really believing like that. We start really believing that are we that important? We start believing that somehow, you know, we are there. That's when your family, I think, tends to go to the other direction, yeah? 

01:55:20
Right. 

01:55:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. 

01:55:25
JOSEPH PONTEROTTO Thank you Thomas! Let me invite Maria. Please don’t clap. What I'd rather do is I'd rather let elders to… to raise and let us honor you by applauding you for all the contributions you're gonna make or have made in your career. So please join me in congratulating our audience. Thank you very much and we have Maria who wants to share a couple of things. Thanks. 

01:55:45
MARIA Thank you Joe. And the first thing I want to say is I'm really reminded of something Dr. Barcus said yesterday mentoring awards address, truly resonated with me as I listened this morning which is, you know, there are two ways to be a mentor. One, you can do things that are reflective of mentoring or you can be a mentor. And without a doubt all six of these individuals up here, you would acknowledge with me are mentors and we have all learned from them. And I appreciate what you just said. But really, please stand and let's acknowledge these six people. 

01:56:25
[sil.] 

01:56:30
MARIA And also please remain standing as I… as I said at the beginning, we have a very special anniversary to acknowledge today… it's actually tomorrow. And as Melba said, it takes a village to raise a child, but also takes a village to celebrate and recognize and just share the joy of reaching certain milestones. Tomorrow, Melba has a birthday. May I say… well, it's over 21 and 60, 60. So please join me in singing first 'Feliz cumpleaños a tu' in Spanish 'happy birth day to you' and then we can do second verse of happy birthday to you. So those of you who know this Feliz cumpleaños a tu, Feliz cumpleaños a ti, Feliz cumpleaños a ti dear Melba, Feliz cumpleaños a ti. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Melba Happy birthday to you. 

01:57:50
