DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in the trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time every day to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is Do I Really say that to myself? I mentioned before that I've worked with thousands of trauma survivors and mental health practitioners. You know, one of the things that everyone seems to struggle with is negative internal language. In other words most of us have a habit of saying terrible things to ourselves, things that would offend us terribly, if someone else were to say it to us. After trauma, this can become a huge problem because, the messages can make us feel like the trauma is occurring again. For example, I remember a working with a woman, was in an abused relationship and she admitted to me that she kept saying to herself that she wasn't worth anything and that she was unlovable. Well, of course, it's terrible to be in an abusive relationship, but to continue to replay the terrible things that were said to us by an abusive spouse one after the relationship's over creates even a worst problem(ph). Because what happens is we literally, reprogramming our minds to believe the negative things of hurt. Let's practice this together. One, what was the meanest thing you said to yourself in the last 24 hours? Let's simply honest with yourself. The reality is, you don't have to be honest with me or anybody else but, you really need to be honest with yourself. I hear loads of different things from my clients. I'm ugly, I'm worthless, I'm stupid, I'm damaged, I'm embarrassing and on and on and the pain that goes along with that can just be as bad as if we're hearing it from somebody we know. Don't worry about the content; just capture the one worst sentence. Now, write out the closest approximation to the positive. For example, if I said to myself, I'm ridiculous. I could reframe it by saying, "I'm doing the best I can in this movement." If I said I'm a bad person, I could say, "I'm working toward being better person." Today, get the idea. Now, you try, write out the sentence that represents something negative you said to yourself recently. Then add the following new self-talk habit. "In this moment I am working toward being a better person. I am working toward my own growth and recovery. I am worthy of the treatment. I'm worthy of caring for myself." Just notice, how it makes you feel. For some people positive words can actually make them feel worst initially, because they're so far away from what they habitually say to themselves. So this is going to take some practice, just like working in new shoes, saying new things, even positive, can make us feel uncomfortable. Practice and allow the discomfort without getting attached to it. Then repeat the positive statement and just notice. For most people practicing the positive new internal language gets easier over time. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to capture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a healthy new practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
