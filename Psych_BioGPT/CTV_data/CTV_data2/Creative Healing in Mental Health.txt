EMi Expressive Media Inc. Presents Creative Healing in Mental Health Art & Drama in Assessment & Therapy Judy Rubin Ellie Irwin Why Use Art & Drama? The Arts Enable Expression 

00:00:15
DAN ARON This film is designed for trained mental health workers who want to be more creative in their work. It's about using art and drama in assessment and therapy with people of all ages, ideally or if possible under the guidance of an expressive arts therapist. What are benefits of including simple art and drama activities in your own work? Will the arts allow even those with little or no language to express themselves more freely and more fully. 

00:00:45
RALPH RABINOVITCH Child Psychiatrist Thumping like that show me what, show me. 

00:00:50
Stevie is Mute Zac has Asperger's Syndrome 

00:00:55
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So what do you think you'd like to start with. Looks like it's the magnet ah. 

00:01:00
ZAC Yes. 

00:01:00
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Art Therapist & Psychologist They are pretty amazing aren't they? So you can use them in any way you want. What are you thinking as you're putting this together. 

00:01:10
ZAC I don't… I don't know how tough it is. 

00:01:10
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER It's tough isn't it? It is tough. 

00:01:15
Hello, this is Margove(ph). I want to… we want to order two large pizzas. 

00:01:25
DAN ARON The arts help people to relax and to project aspects of themselves that are often hard to know about. 

00:01:35
I was droved here entirely against my will. I ah… it was suppose to be lunching at the mess(ph). I don't know what you people are up to. I was here to lunch with the governor and his wife. I have no idea where are (inaudible ) have come from. 

00:01:50
Strong Feelings 

00:01:50
DAN ARON Even verbal patients have trouble when overwhelmed by strong feelings. 

00:01:55
VIOLET OAKLANDER Gestalt Therapist & Psychologist What I would like to do is I want to imagine that this is Sarah. 

00:01:55
Hmm… hmm… 

00:02:00
VIOLET OAKLANDER This rough figure and I like you to tell Sarah what you'd like to say to her. Really you're angry at her. 

00:02:10
Hmm… hmm… 

00:02:15
[sil.] 

00:02:20
VIOLET OAKLANDER Do you have any words that you could say to her with that? 

00:02:25
It looked (inaudible ) 

00:02:26
Traumatic Memories 

00:02:26
DAN ARON Because traumas are often remembered in images and the body, the arts are an ideal pathway for coping with the pain they leave. 

00:02:35
And ah… I still get nervous. I mean, I really get nervous. I like being able to do the drama therapy because you tend to talk about things and that's what helps me. I don't know why but it, that stuff helps me feel better. 

00:02:50
MARY LOU LAURICELLA Drama Therapist What are the think that you could say that could change a person's mind, even as a combat veteran? 

00:02:55
So always images in my head like read, it's like (inaudible ) you know, you know not I'd be alone I've started to paint. You want to reconnaissance were you just get one talk to somebody and don't get a chance to talk to anybody, just you by yourself you know. 

00:03:15
MARY LOU LAURICELLA That is your portrait this is… this is… Vietnam 

00:03:20
Yeah. Those are the images they don't go away no barrack can talk to about it. You know only just… 

00:03:25
I know. 

00:03:25
Yeah. 

00:03:25
Preverbal Body Memories 

00:03:25
DAN ARON Body memories from a time before a child has words can be more easily expressed with a visual language. 

00:03:35
LINDA GRANTT Art Therapist Dianne yesterday we worked on a series of drawings to illustrate the trauma that you had described in going through a tonsillectomy. You're almost to… 

00:03:45
DIANNE Something similar to that. 

00:03:45
LINDA GRANTT Okay could you do a picture then that would represent those body memories of feeling cold, not being able to breathe and having your mouth hurt because there was something in your mouth. 

00:04:00
DIANNE And my mouth is really big. It's really big and it won't shut. And it hurts. 

00:04:05
LINDA GRANTT Okay and you've done that picture then of the body memory of being cold, and be and having your mouth hurt and not having any air to breathe in your mouth felt very big. When you and I look at this series of pictures again we'll remember that that's the hurting tickle that came in your throat. After you woke up form the operation. 

00:04:30
Essential Conditions A Playful Atmosphere 

00:04:35
DAN ARON One essential condition for more creative healing through the arts is to establish a relaxed playful atmosphere as in this workshop for child life specialist in a hospital. 

00:04:45
JUDY RUBIN And the instruction for this activity are to fool around, fool around with the toy. Use one or more of what you've made and pretend it is alive and have a conversation with the person next to you, find a voice for this character. Doesn't have to be your voice like (inaudible ) how are you? 

00:05:10
ELLIE IRWIN Oh I think you're new witnessed neighbor aren't you? 

00:05:10
JUDY RUBIN Yes, I'm little uncomfortable. 

00:05:15
I'm the bright new shiny heart. 

00:05:15
Leave me alone. 

00:05:15
Why? Why? I just want to talk. I want to be friend. 

00:05:20
Because… go away. 

00:05:20
Why? Why? What's the matter, tell me, tell me. 

00:05:20
Because I'm mad. I don't want to talk to you. 

00:05:25
Now I'm going to press you until you talk to me. 

00:05:25
I'm hiding. 

00:05:30
No, no, no. come out of hiding. Look I'm getting my friend my bright shiny flower to come out. 

00:05:35
I can't hear your. 

00:05:35
No, come on. 

00:05:35
I want everybody just leave me alone. 

00:05:40
Because I want to be your friend. 

00:05:40
I don't want any friends because all my friends forgot about me. 

00:05:40
Well I may forgetting about you why I might here now? 

00:05:45
I missed my old friends. 

00:05:45
Can you miss your old friends but why can't we become friends and then I can eventually become an old friend but I won't forget about you. 

00:05:55
Well may be. 

00:05:55
DAN ARON This child psychiatrist is learning how to use puppets. Under the supervision of the drama therapist. 

00:06:00
ALEX STRASSER Child Psychiatrist We've got lot of puppets right over here. I like you to pick out a few okay. And then bring them over. You got all the ones you want. Alright. 

00:06:15
LAUREN Hello, but I know who did. 

00:06:20
ALEX STRASSER Answer your best buddies now, what are you going to do next. 

00:06:20
LAUREN I might go to to work again. 

00:06:25
ALEX STRASSER Thank you. 

00:06:25
LAUREN You're welcome. 

00:06:30
ALEX STRASSER Alright Lauren do you want to sit in the chair? And can we talk about the play. So if you're going to give the play a title what would it be called. 

00:06:45
LAUREN Um… thanks giving dinner. 

00:06:45
ALEX STRASSER Thanks giving dinner. 

00:06:45
Materials Things from Home 

00:06:50
DAN ARON In addition to establishing a playful non-judgmental atmosphere you'll also need some materials but they can be quite simple. 

00:07:00
JUDY MERRITT Drama Therapist & Psychologist Sometimes in newspaper is just a newspaper, sometimes it's a magic newspaper. I think this newspaper could be… a telescope. 

00:07:15
I'm Miss. Cool. 

00:07:15
Miss. Cool. I think you need a scepter. 

00:07:20
New York city. Nobody is going to dace with us right. 

00:07:25
Right. 

00:07:25
Art 

00:07:30
DAN ARON You don't need fancy art supplies but you do need to offer things that are sturdy and attractive. Like paper that won't tear. 

00:07:35
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER I have different sizes of some white paper here. And I have a lot of color paper back there too. So look around and see what you'd like to draw on. 

00:07:45
I think I will draw on this white paper. 

00:07:50
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Alright. 

00:07:50
DAN ARON You want to have something to draw with. 

00:07:55
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Lot of color pencils, markers. 

00:07:55
DAN ARON Something to paint with. Something to model with, and something to construct things with. People will respond to the materials themselves as well as what they make with them. 

00:08:10
I never saw like paintings like this before. Now, these colors I know are Halloween colors. We want to like a (inaudible ) and my bag got so heavy I could barely hold them. This paint dries out really quick. 

00:08:30
I mean it's some… some sticky object(ph). 

00:08:30
Drama Costumes, Props, Jewelry 

00:08:35
DAN ARON People of all ages like to pretend and props really help. An eye patch can make you a pirate. A stethoscope can make you a doctor. 

00:08:45
Just like that David 

00:08:45
DAN ARON A hat and tie can help you feel like a daddy. A hat or jewelry can help you b e a fine lady and even a princess. 

00:09:00
ELLIE ERWIN Drama therapist & Psychologist Oh miss princess you're getting dressed up to go somewhere? 

00:09:05
DAN ARON Or a bride. 

00:09:10
YEHUDIT SILVERMAN Drama & Dance Therapist The moment you've create your space, put on the costume and entering the complete different reality, that's really amazing. It make belief but it's just as real what happens during that time. 

00:09:25
Miniature Toys 

00:09:30
DAN ARON Creating a story with small figures and toys allows someone to feel truly in control. 

00:09:35
ELLIE IRWIN Look at all the toys… 

00:09:40
And see what I can play with. 

00:09:40
ELLIE IRWIN And see what you could play with, yes. Whatever you want to do. 

00:09:45
DAN ARON Organized shelves or baskets help people to find what they need to tell their stories. 

00:09:50
ELLIE IRWIN Yes, stand up. 

00:09:50
This guy is going to have a spear. 

00:09:55
[sil.] 

00:09:55
Then shot this. 

00:10:00
ELLIE IRWIN What are these guys fighting about any way. 

00:10:05
Well, the knights were rich. 

00:10:10
ELLIE IRWIN They wanted the money. 

00:10:10
And… and no one is there in the house because it's full of gold. 

00:10:15
ELLIE IRWIN Oh, wow! 

00:10:15
I wasn't just in one room it was to all of the rooms, in the hall way, everywhere. 

00:10:20
ELLIE IRWIN My goodness, so much money. And what's gonna happen to all that money now? 

00:10:30
Well, at the end of the war they decided to put the money to give all the money to poor because… 

00:10:35
ELLIE IRWIN To the poor. 

00:10:35
Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:35
ELLIE IRWIN Oh my goodness. Then if you could be somebody in this story yourself, who would you like to be? 

00:10:45
If I was a hockey story then I would be Sidney Crosby. 

00:10:50
ELLIE IRWIN He like to be Sidney Crosby, the real hockey story. But it is not a hockey story. It's a story about knights and army men. 

00:10:55
Yes. 

00:10:55
Sand Play 

00:11:00
DAN ARON The sand table can also be a stage. The therapist follows this girl's lead in her drama. 

00:11:05
What's happening. 

00:11:05
Show me the elephant(ph) 

00:11:10
You want me to have this girl? 

00:11:10
Yeah, you knock on the door okay. 

00:11:10
I knock on the door and then what? 

00:11:15
I have to come. 

00:11:15
And then you come okay. Knock, knock, knock. 

00:11:20
Hi. 

00:11:20
Hello. 

00:11:20
How are you doing? 

00:11:20
I'm doing okay. 

00:11:25
Hi. 

00:11:25
Hello, what's your name? 

00:11:30
Ejuda(ph) 

00:11:30
Ejuda(ph). It is nice to see you Ejuda(ph). 

00:11:35
(inaudible ) my table. 

00:11:36
At your table okay. 

00:11:36
This is what he… 

00:11:36
Okay. 

00:11:40
It's really gape(ph). 

00:11:40
That's on the table alright. 

00:11:40
Help, help 

00:11:45
Help, somebody is saying help Ejuda(ph) what's happening? 

00:11:45
Masks 

00:11:50
DAN ARON Since ancient times although they could be made a very simple materials masks have been used to show as well as to hide feelings and fantasies. 

00:12:00
ELLEN HILTEBRAND Art Therapist The outside is the way you think people saw you and saw your family when cancer came into your life and then inside of the mask is how you really felt inside when cancer came into your life. 

00:12:10
Tears represent the time when we didn't know (inaudible ) sister who is going to live because that was like, really painful you don't even know if you're ancestors going to live. 

00:12:20
Puppets 

00:12:20
DAN ARON Puppets too could be made of simple materials but can carry powerful messages because they offer the safety of disguise like this drama about being cut by two hospital therapists. 

00:12:30
Child Life Specialists Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh UPMC 

00:12:35
Hi, I'm the sunny the sun. 

00:12:35
I'm piper, the pumpkin. 

00:12:40
You seem sad. 

00:12:40
I'm. 

00:12:45
Why are you sad? 

00:12:45
Because, it's almost Halloween. 

00:12:45
I got excited for Halloween. 

00:12:50
Not me. 

00:12:50
What makes you sad about Halloween. 

00:12:55
People always cut me. 

00:12:55
That sounds terrible. 

00:12:55
I don't want to be cut at all. Why do I have to be cut? 

00:13:00
Because you're a pumpkin. 

00:13:00
But why not cantaloupes? Why is it always the pumpkin? 

00:13:05
Because pumpkins are special. 

00:13:05
Thank you. 

00:13:10
You're welcome. 

00:13:10
Hello. 

00:13:10
ROSEMARIE PERLA What's your name? 

00:13:15
Napoleon Bonaparte. 

00:13:15
ROSEMARIE PERLA Ah… Napoleon Bonaparte well thank you. You're, you're quite a famous character aren't you? 

00:13:20
And did I'm. 

00:13:20
ROSEMARIE PERLA And tell me Mr. Napoleon what do you do? 

00:13:25
I take over the world. 

00:13:25
ROSEMARIE PERLA Ah… you take over the world. Um… well that's a big job. 

00:13:30
It is a big job and I'm very good at. 

00:13:35
ROSEMARIE PERLA So tell me, um… do you have a name. 

00:13:40
Oh yes, my name is Frederick. 

00:13:45
ROSEMARIE PERLA Fredrick, well Fredrick at first you seemed kind of ominous but now you… you seem kind of I don't know how would you describe yourself. 

00:13:50
Well, (inaudible ) disrespect I think that first impression can be very deceiving. 

00:13:55
ROSEMARIE PERLA Drama Therapist & Psychologist You're absolutely right. You're absolute right. We do have to be careful about those things. There is a very interesting character, historical character Mr. Napoleon I'd like to introduce you too. 

00:14:05
Hello. 

00:14:05
Hello. 

00:14:05
Do I own your country? 

00:14:10
I do not. 

00:14:10
I'll see to it that I do. 

00:14:15
ROSEMARIE PERLA Hmm… well Mr. Napoleon you certainly get to the point right away don't you? 

00:14:15
I'm a man of no subtlety. 

00:14:20
ROSEMARIE PERLA Alright Anna 

00:14:20
ANNA Yes. 

00:14:20
Let me, let me meet your character here. Hello, tell me what's your name. 

00:14:30
My name is Belbo. 

00:14:30
ROSEMARIE PERLA Well Lucy I'd like to introduce you to some… someone this is over here is Belbo. What's wrong Lucy? 

00:14:35
They scare me. 

00:14:40
ROSEMARIE PERLA What was that like today using puppets? 

00:14:40
ANNA Um… I felt like I was little kid again. How about you Ben(ph) 

00:14:50
BEN Um… yeah it brought back a little bit of déjà vu for me just because Anna used to play with puppets all the time when we're little. 

00:14:55
ROSEMARIE PERLA I see, I see. What do you find yourself playing with these days. 

00:14:55
BEN Face book, the TV. 

00:15:00
ANNA Yeah. 

00:15:00
DAN ARON As you'll see there are many ways to offer puppets but it's very helpful if the therapist structures the session by asking to meet the characters. 

00:15:10
ELLIE ERWIN So would you introduce your character. 

00:15:15
This is Codie(ph) the octopus. 

00:15:15
ELLIE ERWIN Could you tell us where the story begins. 

00:15:20
Well, I live in the pacific ocean. 

00:15:25
DAN ARON Marry then enacts a dramatic story about three friends and gives a surprising association to it. 

00:15:30
ELLIE ERWIN But what would you say the story is about? 

00:15:30
Um… I think the story is about Codie(ph) overcoming his fear that helping other people overcome their fears. 

00:15:40
ELLIE ERWIN Hmm… hmm… really that ever happened to you? 

00:15:40
Well one time, whenever I was sick, I had the flu and I was afraid that I was going to die, but then my mom and my dad explained to me that the flu can be cured, because doctors have figured out a way to make it better. And after that I wasn't so worried about it. 

00:16:00
Enhancing Creativity Provide Choice 

00:16:00
DAN ARON How can you help each person to find their own creative voice. Well, having a choice helps everyone. Even someone with Alzheimer's disease. 

00:16:10
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER What I first do is I'll give you a choice as to whether you would like to use white paper… 

00:16:15
Hmm… hmm… 

00:16:15
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER I have some of that out or color papers what are you're in the mood for today. 

00:16:20
That's a good question. I think I like the color better than the white. 

00:16:25
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER A color paper. 

00:16:25
Hmm… hmm… yeah. 

00:16:25
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Okay now, what color? 

00:16:30
I like blue. 

00:16:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER There is a blue. 

00:16:35
I like that blue. 

00:16:35
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Alright now think about whether you would like to um… use the oil pastels or use the… the markers. You can make anything you want. 

00:16:45
Uh… huh… 

00:16:45
Be Clear 

00:16:50
DAN ARON It also helps if you're clear about what you're asking people to do. 

00:16:55
ELLIE ERWIN Okay you Denny, you've picked out these things from the toys and now you're going to do a sand world. No right, no wrong just do it any way you want that's how you're making a world there in the sand box. Okay. 

00:17:10
DENNY Okay. Once upon a time there were two horses that lived in the little sand world. 

00:17:20
Helping People to be Comfortable Patsy Nowell-Hall Art Therapist 

00:17:25
DAN ARON Well, young children are usually spontaneously. Warm ups help those who are inhibited to relax them to create. 

00:17:35
We'll do pass the story, so there were pumpkins on fence. And it was dark and then… 

00:17:45
A crow flew by. 

00:17:45
And the littlest pumpkin had said I'm scared I don't know what that is. 

00:17:50
Is there anybody brave among us says the pumpkin. 

00:17:55
I'm certainly not brave I'm very afraid of whatever is up there. There is a cat crawling around on the ground and there may be the cat. 

00:18:05
That is a scariest 

00:18:10
Crow I've ever seen. 

00:18:10
Starters Scribble Drawing 

00:18:15
DAN ARON Here are some ways to help people get ideas, boosters for their creativity, like the scribble drawing that often leads in meaningful directions. 

00:18:20
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER And you're going to just move your arms and over the paper and then just make a really easy scribble. 

00:18:30
Okay. 

00:18:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So, just like kindergarten, you know it can look like anything. um… if you've ever looked up in the sky and you've seen clouds and you look at them and you say well that one looks like a car or that looks like an airplane so we're going to… I want you to look at the lines that you have made and find an image within that. You can turn in all four directions so you're looking for an image with in the scribble. 

00:19:00
Okay, alright this is kind of farfetched. 

00:19:00
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Farfetched is good. We like farfetched. 

00:19:05
I kind of feel like this looks like a head with legs, 

00:19:05
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Ah… hah. 

00:19:10
I'm not sure what this would be. So surely, this is a person may be holding something or… 

00:19:15
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER You could make it into that, sure. 

00:19:15
Like bowing down a little bit. 

00:19:15
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Right. So now, either take your thin markers or the regular markers you have and add lines to it so that I can also see the image that you see and again don't worry about what it looks like. 

00:19:30
Yes, it's good. 

00:19:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Okay great. You know just tell me something about what you've made. 

00:19:35
Okay. Well I guess I made her getting water 

00:19:40
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:40
And now I guess the image that comes to mind is… have you ever seen… I don't know why this came to my mid, when we're seeing the jungle book? 

00:19:50
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Ah… hah… 

00:19:50
Whenever, um… the little I feel something like (inaudible ) and he goes and he finds like the… the is where the first sees another person and it's a little girl and she getting water out of the river and like one of those jugs that they put on their heads… 

00:20:05
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Alright, uh… huh…. You know they carry them on their heads that's kind of what I feel like this might be. 

00:20:10
If she were to say something aloud what would she say? 

00:20:15
May be what past the river and what's… 

00:20:15
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So she is thinking about what's ahead. What's in the future. 

00:20:20
Put my jug down and go further than the river. 

00:20:25
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:25
So she is trying to make a decision. 

00:20:25
Yeah. 

00:20:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So if you were to give this drawing a title what title would you give it? 

00:20:35
May be girl with options or girl with decisions. 

00:20:35
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Okay. 

00:20:35
If this jug of water were to symbolize something in your life what might that be? 

00:20:45
Hmm… to put down and like move forward you mean. 

00:20:45
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Uh… huh… 

00:20:50
I think I value my parents opinion very much but it, I think sometimes I can turn into um… not so much valuing but like meeting there opinion or um… 

00:21:00
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Their approval 

00:21:00
Yeah. 

00:21:00
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:05
And sort of just instead of I mean like making my own, just doing things and not calling my mother or father and saying like oh I'm going to do this. And got waiting for response you know. 

00:21:15
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Now, I've showed the answers are all within you and um… 

00:21:20
Yeah, it's correct. 

00:21:25
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Yes, I am just going to say you know you can't be scary, exciting I know but scary. So if you could give her advice what advice would you give her? 

00:21:35
Um… just whatever decision you make be strong, it may be. 

00:21:40
Scribble Poem 

00:21:40
DAN ARON You can even make a poem form a scribble. 

00:21:45
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER This was a scribble drawing, this one I am calling a scribble poem and so we're not going to worry about rhyming but what I like you to do is to put some words that describe how you're feeling these days. So you have caring, busy, safe, contemplative, silly, love, finally doing school too young. If you could give this particular scribble poem a title what title would you give it. 

00:22:10
Current Katy(ph). 

00:22:10
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Oh I like that. You can write that one. How did you feeling doing this experience? 

00:22:20
I like this, I like finding something in something. 

00:22:25
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Yes. 

00:22:25
And I'm just having to make it into a creative… 

00:22:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Right. 

00:22:30
…process or like that. 

00:22:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER And I really think the big thing to keep reminding yourself again as how strong this girl is? And how strong you're in decisions that you've made and in your opinions and… 

00:22:45
Hopefully. 

00:22:45
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Yes, yeah. 

00:22:45
Photographs 

00:22:45
DAN ARON Photographs of people, especially of feelings and stimulate many ideas related to the self. 

00:22:55
ALICE KARAMANOL Art Therapist Which one can you think of to say something. One of these things must be saying something to you what she is saying, actually you got to look on her face. 

00:23:00
Very upset. 

00:23:05
Alright, I am very upset. 

00:23:10
DAN ARON Here too being able to choose is vital. 

00:23:10
ANNA I like this one, I know this is but I feel about Ben sometimes socked, the kid is stocked. 

00:23:20
You're socked at me? 

00:23:20
Sometimes. 

00:23:20
What to Do 

00:23:25
DAN ARON What to request depends on your diagnostic or treatment goals. 

00:23:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So after what I will do is I will give people choice whether they want to do their own thing or if you want me to give a suggestion and either way is perfectly fine so… 

00:23:40
Okay I think I'd probably do better off with you directing me. 

00:23:40
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Okay that's good. Let's go with drawing a feeling, a feeling that you've had… 

00:23:50
Okay. 

00:23:50
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER And… 

00:23:50
And I have something in mind already. 

00:23:50
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Okay, great. Okay so tell me something about what you've made? 

00:24:00
What I have drawn is a picture of myself and my horse following traumatic amputation of my left foot it's very frustrating, not being able to mount, dismount, ride the way that I used to do. 

00:24:25
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So if you could be saying something in this image of yourself what would you be saying? 

00:24:30
I would be saying I am coming back. 

00:24:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Hmm… 

00:24:35
And that I will be there soon and I won't see this angry really painful thing that I feel. 

00:24:40
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:45
If there was series of this and this was picture number one, the next picture would be more healing and me on the horse. 

00:24:55
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So is the horse could say something in this image what might the horse say? 

00:24:55
And he does say I am waiting on you and he knows he knows I am hurt and he does things that I can't image him doing before I was hurt. 

00:25:05
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Hmm… what title would you give it? 

00:25:10
In progress. But I never was (inaudible ) 

00:25:16
Redoing the Image 

00:25:16
DAN ARON At times it helps to make a different ending. 

00:25:20
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER One thing I was thinking we might be able to do is to redo the image and this time you can recreate that, that sense of yourself the way you would like to be. 

00:25:30
Hmm… hm… 

00:25:30
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER So tell me about this picture? 

00:25:35
This is me outside on a horse my foot is in the stirrup, it's in there fully wrapped around the horse connected with the horse because that's the cool thing about riding that's when your body and another body are moving in unison. 

00:25:50
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Yes. So what title would you give this picture? 

00:25:55
Soon. 

00:25:55
CAROLE KUNKLE-MILLER Soon. 

00:25:55
Self Portrait 

00:25:55
DAN ARON To evaluate self perception, a self portrait makes the most sense. 

00:26:00
BYRON FRY Art Therapist Think about something that you… that would either present something about yourself, something you want to say about your self to one of the other members here and interest, it could be an interest that you have. 

00:26:10
My symbol is possibly a shoe because what if my main interest is to travel and to discover a lot about places and people and things. 

00:26:20
This is suppose to be a book because I like to read and this is a little piece of chocolate. I like chocolate. 

00:26:30
And this is a happy face, because I like thing by self as a happy person. 

00:26:30
Who Am I? 

00:26:35
After talking for a while, the therapist suggest the theme emerging from their conversation. 

00:26:40
NATALIE ROGERS Expressive Arts Therapist & Psychologist The question of who am I… 

00:26:40
Hmm… hmm… 

00:26:45
NATALIE ROGERS Keeps as come up, a couple of times and I was wondering if you would be interested in just using color just to express, not… it doesn't have to be a picture it could be just lines or… 

00:26:55
Hmm… hmm… 

00:26:55
NATALIE ROGERS …to express who am I? Ah… the various aspects of you and I would suggest to use your non-dominant hand so that you don't have a lot of control over it. Then there is no right or wrong to this and I don't tripped a art. 

00:27:10
It's a good thing. 

00:27:15
NATALIE ROGERS Yeah, its like just who am I. So who is this person? Am… so this is something like a butterfly and then this got some… 

00:27:20
No like… 

00:27:20
NATALIE ROGERS And tell how do to what? 

00:27:25
In other words I try to receive my signals. 

00:27:30
NATALIE ROGERS But there is something about a butterfly image what is it that's… that appeals to you. 

00:27:35
I'm probably somewhere in the cocoon, you know… 

00:27:35
NATALIE ROGERS Hmm…hmm, its interesting. 

00:27:40
Somewhere into a kind of break very soon. 

00:27:45
NATALIE ROGERS And something of a cocoon stage, but has the potential to really became this butterfly. 

00:27:50
Hmm… hmm. 

00:27:50
Is that had interlinear(ph). 

00:27:50
Family Drawing 

00:27:55
DAN ARON To access someone's perception of the family, a family drawing can be representational or abstract. 

00:28:00
You know that was the different branches and all the little hearts represent the different members of the family. 

00:28:10
Hmm…hmm. 

00:28:10
But there are all probably gathered by love. 

00:28:15
Can you tell us which one was you? 

00:28:15
The one down the bottom, is probably the rest of the family is going to stay together and got to be leaving but they still all be together. 

00:28:25
Family Sculpture & Dialogue 

00:28:25
DAN ARON When the family is made of clay, members can interact dramatically. 

00:28:30
VIOLET OAKLANDER What I would like you to make am… your family out of clay. I'm sort of imagine like you and you could talk to him and you could tell them one thing you like and one thing you don't like about each one. 

00:28:50
One thing I would like about dad… 

00:28:50
VIOLET OAKLANDER You… yeah and talk to him. 

00:28:55
Oh yeah… One thing I like about you is that when you do spent time with me, when you do have time to spent with me you use it wisely. The thing I don't like about you is as you don't use the time a lot. 

00:29:15
VIOLET OAKLANDER There isn't enough of that time. 

00:29:15
Alright. 

00:29:15
VIOLET OAKLANDER Not enough of that time. 

00:29:15
Dealing with Loss 

00:29:20
DAN ARON These children who have lost a loved one are making the charge of different feelings about it. 

00:29:25
MAVIS HINES Psychologist Select a word and write the word on the line, so lets say you might feel mad and then you choose a color to go with mad. So mad might be I don't know red or black whatever. You choose as many as you want and when you are finished that. I then want you to color in the circle to match the feelings that you feel. 

00:29:45
Yellow is angry, black is shock and red is wounded. 

00:29:50
MAVIS HINES Red is? 

00:29:50
Wounded. 

00:29:50
MAVIS HINES Wounded, ah… ah. Can you say anything about that wounded feeling. 

00:30:00
Well like it just hurt me. 

00:30:00
MAVIS HINES I want you to draw a picture of the person who died, okay and if that person can be doing anything… whatever you want to do. Ah… Cathleen you want to start over there. 

00:30:15
CATHLEEN This is a picture of… this my dad and me and we are playing catch coach, we both love baseball and we always love to play baseball or to play catch or in the backyard or something like that, he always will make me like to do. 

00:30:30
MAVIS HINES And now I want you to draw picture will handout some paper and I want you to draw a picture about the weather inside. What did the weather feel like inside. 

00:30:45
This is a picture of storm with thunder and because my dad die as we were very sad so… 

00:30:55
Fears 

00:31:00
DAN ARON People of all ages bring their fears to therapy. Edie drew about his diabetes. 

00:31:05
Edie do you have a name for it? 

00:31:10
EDIE Fear of when I first get diabetes. 

00:31:10
These are the fears you have in you, tell us about it Edie. 

00:31:15
EDIE Well this first picture here of a syringe was when I first became a diabetic. Because sort of fed up giving shots because people told me that they know somebody who had gotten a needle broken half in the arm from jerking suddenly. 

00:31:30
That was scary wasn't it? How about this? 

00:31:35
EDIE Well when I'm swimming a lot, it takes up a lot of my energy and my blood sugar goes down and sometimes when I deep swim I have to get out if suddenly heat run away. 

00:31:45
As this so you are afraid in the pool? 

00:31:45
EDIE I'm afraid, I might ground(ph) or I will make bed on side. 

00:31:50
I see, what this one. 

00:31:55
EDIE Amputation is a one of the things that how we going to take care of that then. 

00:32:00
How do you mean? 

00:32:00
EDIE Well if I don't take care of part of my life or part of my body it will be amputated and I will be losing(ph) again. 

00:32:05
How To Do It Empty Chair 

00:32:10
DAN ARON There are many ways of working in drama and in art. Here is some simple techniques for trying out new behaviors. The empty chair is the safe way to confront another person. 

00:32:20
ROSEMARIE PERLA In our sessions we have been talking a lot about ah… relationships as so was there one in particular that you wanted to talk about today? 

00:32:30
There was… am… the one that I realty wanted to talk about is the one ah… about my boyfriend. You know, we have been dating on and off for nearly a year… I don't think it's the most healthy environment for me or my son and I really think that it will be better if we just part way so I ended it. 

00:32:55
ROSEMARIE PERLA So what's getting in the way of you doing that. 

00:33:00
Every time I try to do it its like he knows, as far… as far I'm trying to do and he will just try to combat it just say you know, I love you and we can work this out and… 

00:33:10
ROSEMARIE PERLA And then what happens on your part? 

00:33:15
And I feel bad, you know because he said I love you, I do anything for you and you know that will be nice and then for a couple of days it will be great and then it will go back to where it was. 

00:33:25
ROSEMARIE PERLA Okay it sounds like that what you would really like to say to him ah… somehow gets more difficult to say when he acts that way. 

00:33:35
Alright. 

00:33:35
ROSEMARIE PERLA But it will be okay if we use the little method today that I sometimes use with clients that helps them to get some clarity about communication with that. Would you be willing to do that? 

00:33:45
Sure. 

00:33:45
ROSEMARIE PERLA What this involves is its something called empty chair. You gonna imaging Marvin sitting in this chair. 

00:33:50
Okay. 

00:33:50
ROSEMARIE PERLA And what I'm going to ask you to do is ah… talk to Marvin and tell him about your feelings and your thoughts regarding your relationship with him and what you would like to do. 

00:34:05
Marvin you know that I love you and I care a lot about you and your children, am… but you we've had our share of ups and downs and it seems like recently the downs have been more than the ups and I think its best if we just cut our looses and move on. 

00:34:30
Rehearsal 

00:34:30
DAN ARON Rehearsal offers a chance to practice without consequences. 

00:34:35
ROSEMARIE PERLA So anything that sounded am… like you would like to say it again or you would like to clarify or to say it differently. 

00:34:45
Yes am… just to say that I think… I would like to say it in a better way about doing better valuing(ph) and I would like to say it in a way that is not offensive to him. 

00:35:00
ROSEMARIE PERLA And so am… why don't we do this would you mind if I stayed in… in the seat and I would be Marvin and you can practice it with Marvin's responses. 

00:35:10
Okay. 

00:35:10
ROSEMARIE PERLA Okay… okay. Hey how are you doing? 

00:35:15
ROSEMARIE PERLA I'm good. Yeah its good to see you too, but there is some things that I think we need to talk about. 

00:35:20
Oh yeah… 

00:35:20
ROSEMARIE PERLA We've talked about this before, but I really think that we will need to sit down and talk about this now. Am… I have been thinking a lot about it. 

00:35:30
Role Reversal 

00:35:30
DAN ARON Role reversal allows you to see things from the others point of view. 

00:35:35
ROSEMARIE PERLA So I'm going to be you, we are gonna switch chairs. 

00:35:35
Okay. 

00:35:35
ROSEMARIE PERLA Okay and you be Marvin. 

00:35:40
Okay, okay. 

00:35:40
So, hey how are you doing Marvin? 

00:35:45
I'm good baby. How are you doing? 

00:35:45
Great… great. You know there is some things that have been on my mind and I… I'd really like to talk to you about… you know we… we've known each other a while… 

00:35:50
We have… there is a lot of things I want to talk about too. 

00:35:55
I think its just time for us to cut our looses and move on. 

00:36:00
But… I don't think that you mean baby… I think you know that god put us together and we need to work this out. 

00:36:05
ROSEMARIE PERLA Just say was this helpful? How about we do? 

00:36:05
It's very helpful. 

00:36:05
ROSEMARIE PERLA Okay and tell me can you say a little bit about what made it helpful. 

00:36:10
It's helpful for one to be able to express it am… and also be able to see some of the things that the person would say back to me so I can basically practice my responses. 

00:36:25
ROSEMARIE PERLA Yeah, right. 

00:36:25
Because that's the way its really gonna be. 

00:36:30
ROSEMARIE PERLA So maybe in future sessions we might want to explore this little bit more. 

00:36:35
I would like do that. 

00:36:35
Working Together 

00:36:40
DAN ARON Family members like siblings can work side by side or together. 

00:36:45
Where… 

00:36:45
…the camel(ph)… 

00:36:45
Although there is a loved one. 

00:36:45
Yeah thank you. I'm gonna use this little piece here. 

00:36:50
Parents & Children 

00:36:50
DAN ARON So can parents and children. 

00:36:55
LAURA GREENSTONE All over see how it's making mark. Okay that's good. You know, I wanted you… what color should the leaves (inaudible ). 

00:37:10
Can be a little I have this on orange. 

00:37:10
LAURA GREENSTONE You want some orange? 

00:37:15
One more will be pretty. 

00:37:15
LAURA GREENSTONE What is that at the top? 

00:37:20
Art priority. 

00:37:20
LAURA GREENSTONE And what is that say? 

00:37:25
It's mommies carving. 

00:37:25
LAURA GREENSTONE Art Therapist Very… very good. I think it's awesome you wish to take it home. 

00:37:30
What was it like working together today? 

00:37:35
LAURA GREENSTONE How do you like drawing with mommy? 

00:37:35
Good. 

00:37:35
LAURA GREENSTONE Yeah. I had fun. I like to maintain some flower to gather the best. 

00:37:40
DAN ARON Couples can also work jointly in salient way as in this example. 

00:37:45
So what I'm going to ask you each to do is to begin to draw but not talk to each other so I don't want you to plan out what is going to be. So I'm going to give you about four minutes to begin to put together ah… a drawing that you two have done without words. 

00:38:05
DON You first. 

00:38:10
Let's go no… simultaneous come on man. 

00:38:10
DON Okay. 

00:38:10
Alright. Tell me what it was like to work on the… the paper together without speaking to each other. 

00:38:20
DON I had an idea in my head of you know trees and forest and as we started to draw that then she is drawing is okay. I can we… make the two work together. 

00:38:30
Hmm…hmm. 

00:38:30
I may get(ph) certainly the assumption that this was where we live, I mean it may not be what you were thinking. 

00:38:35
DON No. 

00:38:35
So, now could you come up with a title… title together for this… this image that you've made. 

00:38:45
Life space. 

00:38:45
DON Here we go… life space. 

00:38:50
Did you either feel you have anything else you wanted to comment on before we finish this. 

00:38:55
For me this house really does symbolize our ability to work together and compromise because the back story is that and we saved up money because we thought we might move to Boston, because I have this potentially wonderful job opportunity, but as we went through the process there really weren't the same opportunity for Don and then ultimately it wasn't the right thing to do the for the family, but we saved up all this money and so we did with that as we created a new home for ourselves in Pittsburgh. I think to me where we live right now symbolizes compromise a vision to accommodate each others needs, nobody getting exactly what they want, but everybody getting good enough so that it's okay, you know. 

00:39:35
DON You don't think about when you look at it everyday, but then when you drawing is oh yeah that's what it means. 

00:39:40
Families 

00:39:40
DAN ARON During both assessment and therapy families can be asked to work together to see how they function as a group. One possibility is a family puppet story. 

00:39:50
ROSEMARIE PERLA So one of you each find a puppet. 

00:39:55
You're starting the story. Do you have an idea? No. 

00:40:05
JOE I have an idea. You want me come up with idea. You know what is fun… is a funny thing happened is how, you know one of me and mommies first dates. We was in… 

00:40:25
I know what dad is talk about. 

00:40:25
JOE We was in North Park, so there was house(ph) and there were raccoons all around and your mommy is in ah… she loves animals. Daddy is a city boy and there was this raccoon was (inaudible ) and rounding the trashcan and I was so nervous and I'm looking at the trashcan and your mommy is cracking up above me being notice about the raccoon. 

00:40:55
So thanks for dinner Joe, that was really good. 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:05
Why are you hiding? 

00:41:05
CHRISTOPHER I'm kind of nervous about raccoons. 

00:41:10
Why? It's just an animal. He is probably more scared of you then you have been. 

00:41:10
CHRISTOPHER They have (inaudible ) and bite. 

00:41:15
True, good point. What should we do? Under reasons that I wanted to go with that, it's because I didn't think he was ever sacred of anything and I thought that was unneeded(ph). 

00:41:25
ROSEMARIE PERLA Hmm… Wow do you think your daddy ever gets scared? 

00:41:30
CHRISTOPHER Yeah. 

00:41:30
ROSEMARIE PERLA He do? Hmm… Daddy ever gets scared? 

00:41:35
CHRISTOPHER Hmm…hmm. 

00:41:35
ROSEMARIE PERLA Yeah. 

00:41:35
JOE When you know that I really get scared of? 

00:41:40
CHRISTOPHER When I might get hurt. 

00:41:45
ROSEMARIE PERLA What something you are not scared of that dad is? 

00:41:45
CHRISTOPHER Raccoon. 

00:41:50
JOE What about the water? 

00:41:50
Yeah, that's what I was going to say. 

00:41:55
ROSEMARIE PERLA So Dad is scared of water? 

00:41:55
CHRISTOPHER Yeah, he can't swim. 

00:41:55
ROSEMARIE PERLA Oh wow… So Joe what you do when you are scared? 

00:42:05
JOE (inaudible ) to overcome it. I will allow me you know (inaudible ). 

00:42:16
ROSEMARIE PERLA What you do when you are scared Christopher? 

00:42:20
CHRISTOPHER I can really think about happy things and how I do stuff. 

00:42:20
ROSEMARIE PERLA Like your dad's thinking of things you do well and what you are maybe able to do to help yourself. What about mom? What you do? 

00:42:30
I usually try to change the situation that is scaring me. So or I cry. 

00:42:40
ROSEMARIE PERLA And what you do when you can't. 

00:42:40
Cry or… or get mad at someone. Do you think? Yeah. 

00:42:50
ROSEMARIE PERLA Yeah. 

00:42:50
Family Picture 

00:42:50
DAN ARON Another option is to create a picture together. 

00:42:55
I guess one equally for shadow. 

00:42:55
Facilitating Reflection 

00:43:00
DAN ARON Learning from the creative experience is part of way it so helpful in therapy. This girl is worried that the therapist will see through her by analyzing her drawing under a microscope. He reassures her that there are no formulas and then understanding is a collaborative process. 

00:43:15
Robert Coles Psychiatrist 

00:43:15
This is not really… is one that we have to draw, if you allow me to I will. 

00:43:20
ROBERT COLES I beg your pardon. 

00:43:20
If you allow me to I will. 

00:43:25
ROBERT COLES Okay once you draw the picture of your father and picture of your mother. 

00:43:30
You are going to analyze the drawings. 

00:43:30
ROBERT COLES You know what I will do, I let you analyze the drawings. 

00:43:35
I'm not going to know what they mean. 

00:43:35
DAN ARON This boy talks more freely about his picture when the therapist pretends that a marker is a microphone. 

00:43:40
JUDY RUBIN Now if you are going to give it a title, what would you call it? 

00:43:45
Home, a sweet home. This is the tree that like all the bees are in front of. This is one of the bees hive. 

00:44:00
DAN ARON The best questions are open-ended ones that don't suggest an answer or reflect the projections of the therapist. 

00:44:05
ELIANA GIL Sand Tray Therapist & Psychologist So now tell me a little bit about your world. What's going on in here in this world you made? 

00:44:10
Some animals are running around. The bees are on the big, on this bear. Because the bear stole the bees honey. 

00:44:20
DAN ARON Interviewing the characters and asking for the main idea are ways to discover meanings. 

00:44:25
ELLIE IRWIN And could I talk to that little girl for a minute. 

00:44:30
DANNY Hmm…hmm. 

00:44:30
ELLIE IRWIN What could her name be? 

00:44:35
DANNY Sally. 

00:44:35
ELLIE IRWIN Sally? 

00:44:35
DANNY Yep. 

00:44:35
ELLIE IRWIN You fell off the horse. 

00:44:40
DANNY Yeah. 

00:44:40
ELLIE IRWIN I'm so sorry. What happened when you fell off the horse? 

00:44:45
DANNY I was riding the horse and we made a turn and we fell off. 

00:44:50
ELLIE IRWIN So if people were watching this story what do you think they might learn from it? Or what did you say the main idea of the story might be. 

00:45:00
DANNY Main idea would probably be that there is always a better side to things. 

00:45:10
ELLIE IRWIN And Danny do you find that to be true for you too? Or you will give an example of a time that you thought things were going pretty rough, but then there was a better side to it. 

00:45:25
DANNY Well today I had a picnic with my church and it was going real fun and we came here and this was really fun too. I'm glad I could do it. 

00:45:40
ELLIE IRWIN I imagine that when you had to interrupt your picnic to come here, you weren't so happy. 

00:45:50
DANNY We were about to do a balloon fight. 

00:45:50
ELLIE IRWIN Oh boy you had to give up the balloon fight to come here? 

00:45:55
DANNY Yeah, but now it seems a lot better. 

00:45:55
ELLIE IRWIN Oh that I'm glad and I'm glad we had a good time doing the story. One more thing Danny if you were to give a name to your story what you think you would call it? Let suppose it was a movie what be the name of it? 

00:46:10
DANNY Probably, a girl, a horses and the construction crew. 

00:46:15
ELLIE IRWIN A girl, a horse and the construction crew. Danny is there anything you want to ask me? I have asked you a lot of questions. There are anything you want to ask me? 

00:46:30
DANNY Did you like my story? 

00:46:30
ELLIE IRWIN Yeah, I thought it was some very fine story. 

00:46:35
Closure 

00:46:35
DAN ARON Creating in the arts is fun. Engaging what's healthy and strong in human beings of all ages. This helps both clients and therapists to manage the inevitable stresses of assessment and of therapy. As in all therapy it's important to provide closure. 

00:46:55
So when you look at the image that you have made how does it make you feel and what kind of memories does it bring back. 

00:47:00
It makes me happy because I did go to beach that had shells and stones washed upon the shore and did have a walk away somewhat like this and I had lots of fun going there so it brings back happy memories. 

00:47:15
DAN ARON Reviewing helps the transition from the intensity of the session to the world of reality. 

00:47:20
JUDY MERRITT Okay so I want you all to close your eyes and the talking stick is a native American tradition where the person who has the talking stick is the one who is speaking and we are just listening and holding the space. So I want you to go back into what you've experienced this afternoon. So you can open your eyes and I will put the talking stick down and then whoever would like the stick can pick up the stick. 

00:47:55
But I think is going to stick with me today as to some of the friendship and the support that we did share today, which is wonderful. So thank you to everybody. 

00:48:10
DAN ARON we hope that you've enjoyed learning some of the many ways in which art and drama can enhance both assessment and therapy for people of all ages. Remember that it safest to give them choices so that there in charge whatever they express then it is best to observe, to listen and to always follow the lead of those you are treating. Helping people to learn more about themselves by working together to find meaning in both process and product is rewarding and enjoyable work for patient and therapist are like.

NARRATOR This is WBBN, host from Pennsylvania group of blind children. This is the art room, kids like art, art likes them. It doesn't matter what you can do, you can do art, real good. We have some more work to do. We'll show you what we're gonna do. Watch. 

00:50:20
"We'll Show You What We're Gonna Do!" 

00:50:25
NARRATOR We really didn't know what was gonna happen. When we started we were told that the children had all kinds of problems, things that would make it hard for them to do what we expected them to do. We wanted to see what children like these could do when given art materials and offered freedom. These weren't just ordinary children. They were the kind of children that are called special or exceptional, which is a polite way of saying that they had a lot of things wrong with them. They had labels like mentally retarded, brain damaged, cerebral palsied and the one label that all of them shared no matter what their other disability was that they were blind. 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:35
NARRATOR And then there is David, who zoomed around the paper with marker, with brush who took all the energy he used to use to bite and pinch and kick and put it into his paintbrush and put it into his pictures. Children have so much to say, it helps to know that somebody is interested in listening, in hearing all the ideas and feelings that get stirred up when children use art materials. 

00:52:10
Oh Lawrence angry at you, he is really angry. 

00:52:15
He is angry as (inaudible )? 

00:52:20
No, no, more, he is even angrier. Ooh! He is cutting holes in her, ah, this is easy to cut. 

00:52:35
Now I take the needle and you stick it right in here, then when you are done, it's all over. 

00:52:50
NARRATOR Peter remembered his experience with a doctor in the hospital. 

00:52:55
PETER This is the operating room and that's where Dr. Seeber(ph) was. Then, then the doctor proceeded with the operation, then after they took out my hernia from here to here then after they were done, then they put me back in the bed. Well, I thought that it was a good operation. I never knew how to paint a picture of an operating room before.

00:54:35
[sil.] 

00:54:40
NARRATOR Two hours a week for two years a group of adolescents came to the outpatient clinic of Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center to be part of an expressive therapy group. Each had a different problem. Each had a different label, but all were hurting. To meet their different needs, we made available a wide range of flexible materials which could be used in a variety of ways. We hoped that through the use of many different creative modalities, these adolescents might come to find, to know and to master what one member called; "That Green Creature Within." The Expressive Media made available included art, drama, poetry, music and dance as well as photography. Super eight movies and slides taken by the group members themselves were used to help these adolescents to look at what was going on and to develop not just artistic but psychic perspective. 

00:55:45
Take it easy, take it easy Don't let the sound of your own wheels Drive you crazy We may lose and we may win though. We will never be here again. So open up… 

00:56:10
NARRATOR Taking directly about sensitive issues was often painful. For some like Mathew it was easier to say things through poetry or in writing. Some of the artwork was almost painfully elegant, such as Cindy's two agonized faces made after witnessing an especially traumatic event. Marlene, herself an abandoned child had recently had an abortion. For months she created, nursed and destroyed a series of symbolic babies. Only then could she talk openly about the experience and her own feelings of loss. A leader in a group of this kind must be flexible enough to play many different roles. Most of the time observing, listening and responding empathically. 

00:56:55
Bill Borrero Child Psychiatrist 

00:56:55
NARRATOR There are times however, that it may be in teaching skills or helping a group member with a task, like helping Sherry make her paper mache sculpture. There were leaders who were willing to look, listen, play, teach, take roles and to help in anyway that might be needed. And most of all, there was a sense of fun, of joy, of playfulness, which made it possible for members to react to each other in a natural way. 

00:57:25
Ellie Irwin Drama Therapist 

00:57:30
NARRATOR There was a feeling of community in which the group members…

00:58:00
A FILM ABOUT GROWING 

00:58:05
NARRATOR Children and the arts go together, because the arts are a way of picking(ph) what comes naturally to children and giving it form. We all know that kids like to move. 

00:58:20
[sil.] 

00:58:30
NARRATOR One of the most helpful things about the arts is that they give children ways of exploring and expressing and articulating so scary feelings. You might wanna mess with you brother, but it's better if you mess with the finger paint. And you might feel like pounding your sister, but it's a lot safer to pound a drum. The angry feelings can go into a story too. The killing is make-believe, and that makes it safe. The punch that can hurt, can become a dance. 

00:59:15
[sil.] 

00:59:20
NARRATOR It can become so highly stylized, and ritualized, that it becomes a thing of beauty, and so those scary, angry, messy feelings can be turned through the arts, into something lovely. Now the same fellow who has two puppets so angry at each other, can also have two puppets who feel very loving toward each other, because children have all sorts of feelings inside them. And the child who begins to feel good, because he knows how to do something. He feels even better, because he has found some grownup who believes in his ability, and who believes in him as a person, who shows him that he likes him, just the way he is. And that good happy feeling, is the feeling that children can get from the arts, from finding out what they can do and learning how to do it. Feeling strong and proud, and really good about themselves. And in the process, grow.

01:01:05
DARCY LYNN Artist The first time I wanted to draw was in intensive care. 

01:01:10
Darcy has Lymphoma 

01:01:10
DARCY LYNN It would be when I was feeling more conscious, because I was sedated with a lot of stuff. And I think it was more the concern to see if I still had it in me, and I could still do it, I could still do that drawing line, it hadn't been taken away. I think my art really helped me, because it was the only way I could hold on to my own identity. And I think if I didn't have that, it would have been awfully difficult. To be treated for cancer is a long process, and you need something, you need something to hold on to, that's you. 

01:01:45
NARRATOR In work which is true to both art and therapy, people are helped to find, to know and to accept the true self, which may be hidden within behind the masks they wear. 

01:02:00
[sil.] 

01:02:05
It lets you let out like, let me let out like what I was mad at and stuff like that. 

01:02:10
What were you mad at? 

01:02:15
Just being in the hospital period. 

01:02:20
You feel someone drawing you get into the space and it's like, I hadn't been there so long that I didn't wanna go there for some odd reason I guess. Maybe I was afraid of it, that I couldn't do it, you know. But slowly but surely I started doing it again. It was like, yeah! 

01:02:35

01:03:20
LINDA GANTT Ah, just let your hand remember. So, we've taken all your pictures and we've put them upon the board here in chronological order. 

01:03:30
DARCY LYNN I think it's a way to express all those things they're afraid to express. People are afraid to express so much, the fear, pain, loneliness, embarrassment, all sorts of things that that no one else can have any idea of. And they can put that into art. 

01:03:50

ELIZABETH LAYTON Artist You heard, and you heard, and you heard, and then you go round and round and round. So I felt I can withstand this and I'll do something. After my son died, my sister wrote and urged me to do something. May be she was into drawing at that time and she thought if I were to draw it might help me. And everybody said; "You don't look like that!" But I knew I look like that, because I had drawn it out of the mirror. 

01:05:30

SARAH BANKER And you've given up a great many choices that you had in your life and your daily routines. And also the sense of control that you have over your life. And you are very confused and it also leads to a lot of depression. But art, if they begin to explore and work in art, I think they can get that feeling of control back of having choices, their infinite choices in art. And the dependency becomes less as they explore and create themselves.

WENDY MILLER Art Therapist Well, (inaudible ) for my brother. He had a stroke which completely incapacitated him, because his left hand was untrained. He could do nothing with it. And then when this program started, it occupied his time and his mind. It's not a luxury, it's really a necessity art. 

01:07:25
EMI Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources 

01:07:30
NARRATOR These four-year-old children are choosing parts of themselves that they want to explore. By beginning with an experience with each part one at a time, they are gradually moving into a richer consciousness of their bodies. The first awareness of self for every human being comes through the mother's touch and through the close contact with her body. Thus the first sense of self is the body sense, awakened by the mother's care. This in turn encourages each child to explore his own body, beginning in infancy and continuing as he grows. When I first met Amy and Debra, two of the children I worked with individually, they were psychotic, in the autistic stage of development. They, like the young infant, spent all of their time stimulating themselves. Their autistic gestures were ritualistic, highly stylized patterns of movement. Communication was then only possible in one way, through our bodies. Since their tiny limited worlds were intensely physical, I tried to enter their worlds and speak their language by reflecting their movements. In the beginning this was simply direct imitation. By doing what she was doing, I was trying to tell her that I liked her just the way she was, without asking anything of her. I wanted her to know that she was safe to be completely herself. Then when she was ready, we could begin to share. 

01:08:55
[sil.] 

01:09:05
NARRATOR Each child within the safety of the room and situation, had I think begun to trust me. Up to now she had permitted touch, but not enough to relax and become passive like a baby. Both girls were now in the earlier stage of symbiosis and spend most of their time wanting to be held. Perhaps it was at this point that they had begun to experience themselves as one of two people in a relationship, and could then begin to grow and go through some crucial faces of normal development, which they missed the first time around. These children then began to explore my body, just as the normal child begins to explore the mother's body. Mutual trust did now exist at the body level. It was beginning to look like a normal relationship. 

01:09:55
[sil.] 

01:10:15
NARRATOR If these adults have reached a better understanding of themselves in relation to their own bodies, perhaps their words and actions can be more honestly reflective of what they really mean. Perhaps then there will be fewer difficulties in communicating with each other and with the children in their lives. After working with children in varying degrees of mental illness, I have learned that body language can be the first means of successful communication. Sometimes it can also be the basis from which verbal communication can grow. We can provide opportunities in which they can be themselves, follow their internal rhythms and discover that their bodies can come alive through movement. Their bodies can then become a beautifully natural part of their speaking, of their listening, of their moving and growing, through a time and space called childhood.

01:11:25
Playing: Pretending Spontaneous Drama with Children 

01:11:25
NARRATOR Playing, pretending, spontaneous drama with children. Playing, creating, it's as natural as it can be. No kids often play out things they're wondering about. It's their way of trying to understand what has happened or what could happen, like doctor play. Most kids have been pocked and looked down and examined and may be even hooked by the doctor. So it feels good to turn it around and be the doctor, and do all those things to someone else. Being active instead of passive. Creating from past experiences and feelings, they project part of themselves into what they make. 

01:12:25
[sil.] 

01:12:30
I'm a boy. 

01:12:30
I'm a girl. 

01:12:35
NARRATOR Sometimes it's even easier to talk about feelings with puppets. Like feelings of affection, surely(ph) in fair doing. Kids have a lot of stories to play out too. Sometimes they're funny stories. Like when Dane had pretended to be a statue for sale in the store, and Ralph began to argue about the price. Well, it was so funny that even Dane had a hard time to keep from laughing. 

01:13:05
RALPH So, it'd be $348! 

01:13:10
$348? 

01:13:10
RALPH Look at that, (inaudible ). It really should be… Look at that, buttons missing. Please… I wanna… I wanna to have it. 

01:13:20
(inaudible ). 

01:13:25
RALPH Maybe not, (inaudible ). Well, look at this! Let's go! 

01:13:30
I had a dream and it was so scary that it woke me up. While I was sleeping I heard that noise and it was like someone is breaking glass. So, I woke up and then I saw a man. He had a knife and then he saw me and he broke the window and he came to (inaudible ). 

01:13:51
NARRATOR Now, playing our dreams can be scary, but if kids talk about it when it's over, it helps to know that other people have scary dreams too, and that dreams aren't for real, but they come from feelings inside, and that it helps to talk about it. 

01:14:10
Wayne Cook Drama Therapist 

01:14:10
NARRATOR Of course, it takes a special kind of grownup to play with kids this way. A grownup who can really listen, a grownup who remembers what it's like to be young. To have all those thoughts, and ideas, and feelings, and stories inside, just waiting for a time and a place to be expressed.

Jim Gardner Drama Therapist 

01:15:30
NARRATOR At the Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, Jim Gardner and Roni Ostfield work with blind and partially sighted children in a creative dramatics program. Spontaneous play can help to organize and make sense of the outer world as well as the inner world of feeling. At times, improvisations are humorous that may also reflect underlying worries as in this unplanned drama. 

01:15:55
Well, let's go, come on, let's go! 

01:15:55
Yeah! 

01:16:00
Come on, come on. You can't even stand up, ah, these guys get on my nerves. 

01:16:05
RONI OSTFIELD Pardon me, one of these belongs to me. 

01:16:05
One of these? 

01:16:10
RONI OSTFIELD Yeah! You, Mary you belong to me, remember? 

01:16:10
MARY No! 

01:16:10
RONI OSTFIELD You are my, you know what… 

01:16:15
You gonna have to take this downtown. We're gonna go around cleaning. 

01:16:15
RONI OSTFIELD I'm sorry, I'm her psychiatrist and she escaped from the ah… the asylum. I'd like to take her back where she belongs, but I'm… 

01:16:20
Hahaha… There's more to this tonight. 

01:16:25
NARRATOR For most children such experiences can be therapeutic, but some children need more specialized help. Trauma therapy focuses on the understanding and working through of conflicts. 

01:16:40
I'll burn it! 

01:16:40
ELLIE IRWIN Drama Therapist And now you have a burn due to bad things are happening to you. 

01:16:45
Ah, alright! How? 

01:16:50
NARRATOR In the drama, feelings and fantasies are expressed and accepted, as therapist and child work towards clarification, control and change. 

01:17:00
Okay! 

01:17:00
NARRATOR Puppet play and improvisation can be valuable diagnostic as well as therapeutic tools for children and their families. 

01:17:10
Ah…Nah…Ha… I'll attack them around! Oh-oh, get off me. Come on help! Oh-oh-oh, come on I gotto go. Oh, my nose! 

01:17:20
NARRATOR The same theme of steeling was in his improvised dramas when the pirate, his favorite character stole from the professor. Eventually, the cop fought the pirate, restored what was stolen and solved the case.

Take your time and look through them and pick the ones, I'll get back to you soon. 

01:17:55
This is a devil. 

01:17:55
Oh, that looks great! Well, like you wanna tell them, this sort of looks like ah… the wizard guy. 

01:18:05
NARRATOR As the family selects puppets, the therapist observes their individual behaviors and their interaction. Some puppets are chosen immediately, others are rejected or avoided. The selection process provides the therapist with important clues about the dynamics of the family. The particular meaning that the puppet has for the person, usually becomes clear through the interaction and conflict portrayed within the story as well as during the discussion after the story when each person is asked to think about which puppets they chose and why. 

01:18:45
How about introducing your puppets to everybody so all the puppets can have a chance to meet each other? 

01:18:50
Okay! 

01:18:50
He likes to go first. 

01:18:50
My name is Ron. Good to see you. And this is Duck. Okay! 

01:19:00
I'd like to take a couple of minutes and to try to think together of a way you could start a story, using some of the puppets that you've got. 

01:19:05
NARRATOR Observing the formation of the story, it is often possible to determine family roles. Most families work best when hidden behind a puppet stage, which provides psychic as well as aesthetic distance. 

01:19:25
Okay! And all these creatures… 

01:19:25
Shut up! 

01:19:25
…even though some may look mean, they're all just like us. 

01:19:30
Hah… Uh…Huh… 

01:19:35
Okay! And so we will start. First I will have to change into my fantasy costume. Are you ready? 

01:19:40
Huh… Yes, and I'm gonna go have my coffee. 

01:19:45
Okay, yes please do that. I'm sure you'll look much better when you're done. 

01:19:45
Okay! 

01:19:45
Okay! Hello, Magic Lobster! 

01:19:50
Hello! 

01:19:50
How was your trip? 

01:19:50
Fine! 

01:19:55
I just wanna tell you guys… 

01:19:55
What? 

01:19:55
…from one species to another, that you can just live under water and be cool. 

01:20:00
Would you like to sing a song for us? 

01:20:05
Okay! 

01:20:05
Okay, sing a song. We all came back together, we brought everything back with us. 

01:20:10
NARRATOR When the story stops, the therapist can continue the interaction by talking directly to the puppets. 

01:20:15
If we could show your story to an audience on television for example, what could we tell them would be the moral of the story? 

01:20:25
You can go somewhere with a stranger, but you'll end up in something that you don't know about. 

01:20:35
Hah…Uh… 

01:20:35
Well of course, I would say that there's a lot to learn from a lobster.
