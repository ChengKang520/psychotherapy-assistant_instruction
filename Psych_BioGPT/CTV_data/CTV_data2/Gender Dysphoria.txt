GENDER DYSPHORIA 

00:00:15
CASEY WEITZMAN I think that people who umm… wanna work with transgender and gender non-confirming people , I think it's a great time to get into this because I find them to be the most authentic group of people that I'm where were work with. 

00:00:30
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY At the bottom line my job is to believe people. My job is to not look for testing, or assessment, so criteria over anything that's going to require me to validate somebody's experience. If somebody comes and he tells me, this is what I'm experiencing, this is what I'm feeling that's the criteria then I need to move forward with that person. 

00:00:50
CASEY WEITZMAN Through that… through what I'm trying to do but it always been my goal is to normalize being transgender, that my hope one day, is that being transgender is just like being like the rest of us. That it's not a problem, it's not an issue, it's just oh, you are this, you're that you know, because being transgender as about who you are. 

00:01:15
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY Umm… this associate yourself with the relationship that it's your job to diagnose. Uh… Umm… I've… I've very much believe is providers in this work that our first job, foremost is advocate(ph) see and education because that most often is where people are lacking in the world around them. Very rarely our parents, partners see if can others children really advocating on behalf of their loved one, I means so part of our job is making sure that were advocating on behalf of our client in their personal professional world. 

00:01:40
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Gender Dysphoria refer is to the distress in individual experiences. When the gender they've been assigned at birth, that is the gender matching that outward appearance or sexual anatomy is different then the gender they identified with. An individual who is assigned male at birth, may experience the world as a female or an assigned female as a male or they may feel that their gender cannot be broken down into the binary terms of male and female. This disparity leans to marked distress or impairment to the extent that it can lead to depression, anxiety or even the individual committing suicide. 

00:02:20
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:02:25
DSM-5® 

00:02:25
Gender Dysphoria 

00:02:25
SIOBHAN DOHERTY The gender dysphoria grouping contains several conditions, each given their own diagnostic code. The diagnostic codes correspond to the codes used by the World Health Organization's in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorders first link to the coding system from ICD-9 with the codes for ICD-10 listed in parenthesis. Hence, all of the DSM codes crosswalk to the ICD codes including the newest adoration ICD-10. For instance, gender dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults is assigned with a code 302.85 in ICD-9 and F64.1 in ICD-10 listed in parenthesis. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10 was released in the fall of 2015 in the United States, although it was adopted previously in other countries. However, because ICD-10 was implemented in the fall of 2015 in the US, this program will be listing the newer code from the ICD-10 first, followed by the ICD-9 codes in parenthesis. Organizationally, the layouts of DSM-5 and ICD-10 are quite similar for gender dysphoria. Though there are some differences in how ICD-10 categorizes it. ICD-10 puts all of the gender dysphorias into F64, their section on gender identity disorder. This is part of the larger F60-F69 section on Disorders of Adult Personality and Behavior. Disorders that "tend to be persistent and are the expression of an individual's characteristic lifestyle and mode of relating to self and others". Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults is categorized as dual-role transvestism in ICD-10 and gender dysphoria in children is categorized as gender identity disorder in childhood. With other specified gender dysphoria and unspecified gender dysphoria named other gender identity disorders and gender identity disorder, unspecified, respectively. These differences may be due to the evolving understanding of gender dysphoria on both the clinical and cultural level. Some of the clinical terms used in 1992 when ICD-10 was originally released, a no longer appropriate as they inaccurately described this sort of experiences for transgender individuals with gender dysphoria. Where the term gender identity disorder signifies an abnormality of an individual's identity in regards to gender, the term gender dysphoria instead points to the distress experienced by transgender individuals, which is why was changed from DSM-4 to DSM-5, we'll hear a little more about this later in the program. Only drafts of ICD-11 have indicated that these terms will be updated when the diagnostic guide is released. We spoke with two therapists and advocates for transgender and gender non-confirming individuals to not only help facilitate greater understanding at the diagnostic guidelines and process but also to provide a larger context for working with individuals with gender dysphoria.

00:05:50
Director, Los Angeles Gender Center 

00:05:50
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY Hi, my name is Aydin Olson-Kennedy, MSSA clinical social worker with the Los Angeles gender center. 

00:05:55
CASEY WEITZMAN …Los Angeles, I've been doing the work for about 25 years, I grow up here in Southern California and umm… I've been working with the transgender and gender non-confirming umm… population for last uh…25 years. 

00:06:15
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY Umm… I got into this work, I think mostly through my own lived experience as a transperson. Umm… I knew that I wanted do counseling or therapy but sort of focusing it down on Trans and gender non-confirming people really as result of my own lived experience around it. Umm… so I've been doing kind of informal counseling and coaching for the last 20+ years and then decided to go back to (inaudible )a formal degree so that I can do this in more umm… formal with education studying, so a counseling therapy means mentorship is really all that I've done in my entire career. 

00:06:50
WHAT IS GENDER DYSPHORIA? 

00:06:55
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY Gender dysphoria is umm… basically a chronic state of distress as it relates to the incongruence between someone's assigned sex and identified gender. 

00:07:00
CASEY WEITZMAN So, their experience a conflict between umm… their covered appearance and their internal being. So, let's say they identified as female inside but they presenting as a male. So, they don't connect, or could be the other way around. So, there is a lot of distress that can be depression or anxiety because they can't be their true self. 

00:07:35
TERMINOLOGY AND LANGUAGE 

00:07:40
SIOBHAN DOHERTY It is important to explore some of the language in terminology used in this work. Beginning with the relationship between the terms transgender and gender dysphoria. Although, there are some differences and how the clinician view this relationship. 

00:07:55
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY The… the… the difference between transgender and gender dysphoria is transgender is an identity where it's, it's sort of the… the end results or the organizing around the experience of gender dysphoria. 

00:08:05
CASEY WEITZMAN With gender dysphoria, it usually will be the initial reason why a patient will come to see me. Then, as we treated overtime when the distress and the anxiety, the depression lives then obviously there is no need anymore to have the gender dysphoria diagnosis that doesn't mean they can't keep coming to treatment but it isn't going to be about the dysphoria anymore, it could be for other life issues where would no longer be big for DSM diagnosis. 

00:08:40
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY Some may say that you can be transgender nor have gender dysphoria, umm… one of the thing is that I spent a lot of time thinking about I'm working on is the many, many ways gender dysphoria presents that it's not always or just organized around someone secondary sex characteristics. So, I have a lot of clients who were uh… report they don't have gender dysphoria may be because they've already persuade gender confirmation surgeries umm… but then we also talk about having anxiety about umm… dating and that's gender dysphoria, right. So, its experiences of anxiety that are directly related to your physical, a litlle bit also about negotiating the world a large. 

00:09:15
SIOBHAN DOHERTY In addition to gender dysphoria and transgender, there are numerous other key terms to be familiar with surrounding gender dysphoria, only some of which are delineated by DSM-5. 

00:09:25
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY The lacks of corner of gender is uh… complex in its ever changing. So you know, you're gonna have a key terms that transgender, transsexuals, little bit more antiquated in tends to be how is mostly and like the medical model of things. Umm… gender dysphoria, umm… transition, social transition, umm… and a, you know, may be couple of others but uh… the… I think the most common understanding a transgender is somebody whose experience is of their genders gonna be different in their assigned sex. So, it's an umbrella term, umm…historically used to denote to somebody hunt engaged in medical transition and so that was sort of demarcation have transgender was like pre-medical transition and transsexual ways, post-medical transition. I don't really see that as much anymore, I certainly don't use that language that way and I… I would went there to say that particularly younger people in the community certainly don't use the language that way. Actually, don't even see it in a medical field as much anymore because the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. So, it is non-necessarily a reference point of transgender, transsexual, it's because the diagnosis in the ICD and DSM is gender dysphoria, so that what you see alive. Younger people umm… you know, many other population that I work with umm… they, you know, transmasculine, transfeminine as oppose to transguy or transgirl umm… assigns female birth her AFAB or assigned male at birth AMAB, rather then like F to M, M to F to a non-confirming gender clear I've write a different versions of that 's is very popular and again umm… it is going to be as varied as the person you're talking to, so cisgenders are really important one understanding the importance of, of why we know obviously biological male and biological female is that again from the history place where we use to talk about his real man, real woman, right and I mean I don't think it take somebody with uh… a great deal of understanding at the work value using something real indicates that something is not real, is deeply problematic. Using the term cisgender which comes from chemistry, cis means same matching, Trans means moving across over or not matching and so its trying to create acuity in the languages assigned, there is no value it's like cisgenders, a transgender. 

00:11:40
CASEY WEITZMAN Umm… the reason why I think these umm… terms are so important is because they feel like they've been so in different franchise and misunderstood by their families, and so this is their opportunity to speak up and we heard. 

00:11:50
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY The importance and power of being a little self labored and self identify is the way of organizing and connecting with community. So, marginalized communities have used labeling and identifying using language to identify for, forever, right. And what happens is that it is most frequently folks who are occupying higher levels of privilege, umm… there are making statements on a pressed communicates about how they should or should not be label in their languaging. So, with the constant awareness in an umm… tending to the impact privilege has on any specific community or group of people. 

00:12:25
GENDER DYSPHORIA IN DSM-5® 

00:12:30
DANIEL I still don't understand why you're making this choice, like you've lived your whole life one way, now you just… 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN It's not a choice, Daniel (ph). What are you talking about? 

00:12:40
DANIEL How is it not a choice? 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN You couldn't understand anything, oh, my gosh! Do you think I would choose something like this? 

00:12:45
DANIEL I mean you are, like you were… 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN But, do you think I wish… 

00:12:50
DANIEL …recognizing in otherway. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, but do you think I would choose something like this if I didn't really feel like… feel this what you think I would choose to walk out of the house everyday and have people make fun of me and to loose my family, and to loose my friends, I wouldn't choose that. You don't understand, you don't understand anything, I can't (inaudible )this cover session with you right now. 

00:13:06
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Well, the term gender dysphoria seems to be more appropriate for describing the sort of experiences than the previous DSM-4 designation of gender identity disorder. There are many pros and cons to consider when approaching whether gender dysphoria should be included in DSM at all. 

00:13:20
CASEY WEITZMAN Ah… it took a long time for umm… for that diagnosis to come out. I'm part of an organization that's called WPATH which is the World Professional Association of Transgender and Health, and we worked as an organization to try and help, come up with this diagnosis. 

00:13:45
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY The way that gender dysphoria and the diagnosis interacts with with insurance primarily is umm… through recent it is legislation analyze, it's certainly has increased access to gender related care which is really fantastic. Umm… but, inherently when you increase access to care few diagnosis's that you also increase pathologizing of a very natural occurrence and very natural experience that has existed as long as humans have existed. 

00:14:10
CASEY WEITZMAN Umm… I like that it is in the DSM umm… many of the transgender population would probably disagree with me, I mean used to be called gender identity disorder. So, was a much more of severe diagnosis and used to be psychological disorder, that was taken out in 2013, so now it's called gender dysphoria. So, it's no longer a psychological condition, it's now umm… a medical condition just like a diabetes or heart disease. 

00:14:45
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY The history generous for us a diagnosis isn't I mean when they previously assigned that was gender identity disorder umm… and before that there was classic transsexualism into the history of what we have used to describe a set of experiences for folks exchange and shift it overtime, I think the… the diagnosis gender dysphoria should live in the world of medicine and not in the world of mental health. Umm… because the interventions for general dysphoria also need medical interventions if that's waht somebody seeks and feels like the right thing for them is their utility and benefit in talk therapy for folks, absolutely for the things they've already referenced of strategizing in building toes and (inaudible )in and making sure that people are able to make decisions that keep themselves physically and emotionally safe. 

00:15:25
CASEY WEITZMAN What I like about it mean in there is that insurance will still help umm… in some of the like the hormones will help with some of the surgeries, so if it's out of DSM completely, there is no way to put a diagnosis on any of the forms and the surgeries, any of the hormones, so I think it is important to have it there. 

00:15:55
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY From in activist in advocate position, uh… I think it would be fantastic if we didn't have any diagnosis associated with this experience but I know that, that's not real, that's not studied in any sort of real world and if you want to continue to have insurance reimbursement pay, we have to have a processor strategy around that. Umm… and you know there is a… there is a shift that it happens socially because we don't have the same relationship with diabetes, we don't have same relationship with lot of other things that do live in the medical world umm… they don't inherently create a response that gender dysphoria does in folks but very much I believe very strongly that it needs to move into the world of medical and out of the world of mental health. 

00:16:35
THE DIAGNOSTIC AND COUNSELING PROCESS 

00:16:40
CASEY WEITZMAN They usually will find me through either friends or the internet umm… so when they call me they may not tell me right off the bat why they're calling me, umm… but they'll come in, they may not say a word about gender right away, but as we get to know each other a little bit more, they will eventually disclose that they're having issues around sexuality or gender and it will slowly come out "unusually I'm the first person in the entire world" that they will disclose and when they come to see me umm… they are… some of them are lmost suicidal because they don't want to take the journey. Umm… that they know will probably cause them possibly their marriage, sometimes their job, sometimes their children umm… so, by the time they come and see me, they've tried everything in their life to not have to go through with this and umm… so, like I said I might be the first person, so they wanted make sure that they're gonna betray with dignity and respect and that they're not gonna be judged. 

00:18:00
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY At the gender I know it is not in common for us, for me because I've receive all those phone calls, for somebody too have a complete inability to even use the word gender because it is so triggering and so upsetting for them and, you know, for most folks their authentic gender has been umm… something that they have held very deep inside for a significant amount of time and expecting somebody to move from… this is my deepest, darkest secret to coming and talking to complete stranger about this sort of experiences, its now realistic, we actually don't have that expectation for other folks as a accessing therapy. If so one has sexual trauma, we don't expect them at for session, to divulge every last detail about their trauma, but sometimes we do have had expectations of Trans and gender non-confirming folks because we're thinking about during this work through an evaluation and assessment process. And then further we can just (inaudible )self from that and the more effective are therapies going to be with our clients. 

00:18:55
CASEY WEITZMAN We'll think about gender dysphoria be in the diagnosis is to meet gender dysphoria is having intense anxiety or depression, and I have seen that with almost 99% of the patients that I see. So, the first thing I'm gonna assess for is suicidal ideation, but in many patients that I see there is so distract over head umm… as they go through the transition alive distress anxiety would decrease but what I initially see them the dysphoria is so severe umm… the… yeah, the diagnosis is really umm… its vary much when excess it is.

GENDER DYSPHORIA IN ADOLSCENTS AND ADULTS 

00:19:45
Gender Dysphoria in Adolscents and Adults: 

00:19:45
F64.1 (302.85) 

00:19:45
DANIEL So, what happened? 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN No, I'm gonna… I just wanted t say hi, and she close the door on my face, my mom. Is this my mother who I have known all my life, yeah. 

00:20:05
DANIEL Did she say anything? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN No. She just like looked at me like I was disgusting, I was like… I'm still same person you know, like I'm a girl now but… you know, only same person and… 

00:20:25
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Gender dysphoria may manifest as the individual feeling that they are genitalia or other sex characteristics do not match the gender they identify with. They may want to be rid of these sex characteristics and wish for the sex characteristics of their self identified gender. Their thoughts, feelings and desires may more accurately reflect that of their self identified gender rather than their assigned gender. They may also want to be regarded as their self identify gender not the one of their assigned at birth. As mentioned previously, this doesn't necessarily mean the individual will identify as the opposite of their assigned birth gender. As their self identified gender might not reflect the binary identities of either male or female. The clinician can specify if the individual is posttransition meaning the individual is exclusively living in their self identified gender and is done some sort of cross sex medical treatment including hormone treatment or general confirmation surgery. This specifier is also appropriate if the individual has just started these treatments or plans to begin them. However, it is important to mention that the process of transition is in black and white, is this specifier might suggest. In transitioning is different for every patient, the clinician encounters. The clinician can also specify if the gender disphoria is with a disorder of sex development with the code of the actual congenital developmental disorder. If the patient doesn't meet before diagnosis for gender dysphoria, the clinician can diagnosis other specified gender dysphoria or unspecified gender dysphoria, other when the clinician chooses to indicate why the patient didn't meet before diagnosis and unspecified when they do not or when there is insufficient information to specify. As with any other disorder or condition aligned by DSM-5 are the mental and behavioral disorder section of ICD-10. There is no one way for clinician to use diagnostic guidelines when approaching work around gender dysphoria with the patients or clients. 

00:22:25
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY For actual diagnosis, like many people I will, I will look at the DSM in sort of roll through the different species that are there and understand the… the degree or amount of somebody's experiencing any of those criteria but, but a lot of that so subjective, right and so, that's the inherence difficulty with diagnosing something that is subjective experience. Umm… anything that's what people get lost alive using diagnostic criteria to diagnose something that is individual occurring for somebody and larger context of social environment that has very rigid binary expectation about someone's gender and assign sex. For me, I'm not a… I'm not a therapist who's folks has lot in diagnosis nor my diagnosis based on the necessity of insurance or access to medical care, medical treatment. So, for me personal in my practice uh… clinically significant is somebody whose functioning is impaired in, in any domain what so ever, so umm… if somebody is depressed or having anxiety or OCD or move disorder which were commonly associated with gender dysphoria and most frequently misdiagnosed. Umm… then their functioning is impaired and that's what's important to me and I make decisions around that. 

00:23:35
CASEY WEITZMAN I think the best practices for diagnosing the gender dysphoria is taking the time. Umm… (inaudible ) therapist or doctors will… will too quickly come up with the diagnosis, umm… instead I think it takes time, I think that it takes umm… A lot of listening, umm… patience umm… I also think it has to do with umm… the provider be non judgmental and keeping their own stuff out of the room, I think it's just to be really sensitive umm… and now assume anything. 

00:24:25
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY Witnessing baring witness and validating somebody's experience, these are… these are very important steps to development for all people as being witnessed and being marred and as trans folks that something they can be very, very difficult that we don't have at all and so understanding the importance of those two along with a lot of other things but those experiences that, sometimes client come in and I'm the first and possibly the only person in the world that is witnessing and validating who they're (inaudible )in that. So, there are times if somebody comes in and they've never want to auteur the words out loud, I'm actually a man or woman, may know I'm transgender, I think that there something happen with my gender that I can be the very first person in the world they've ever said that to you. Or the very first person in the world that they've ever talked about this is actually the name that feels right for me, this is the pronoun that feels right for me umm… and to understand the a men's privilege that I hold as a result of being the first person for somebody umm… or may be I'm not the first person they've, they've said it to me may be I'm the first person that's ever listened, right. And that's … I think that they… I think that are inherently differently in somebody who is accessing mental health, therapy for difficulties in their relationship or depression anxiety that's… that most often folks were coming in with those sort of experiences umm… have already traveled in journey it is significant amount to get to the places saying oh, talk therapy might be beneficial for me. 

00:25:50
CASEY WEITZMAN When someone comes to see me, umm… they what I said they have… they, they hoped that I would tell them anything and so those say it at me, can you just give me a pill? Can you give me a pill and so umm… I helped them financiers, I will not say them this is who you are. I will work with them and council them until they can come up with the answers themselves, umm… I'm very supportive and I'll say them what's wrong with being transgender and then we'll talk about you know, we'll talk about all the hardships. 

00:26:30
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY For adults, its… its little bit different umm… because the adults more or most often they're coming in on their own accord and lastly coming for surgery later, that's gonna be the only exception. Umm… but the strategizes are gonna be different because the adults are navigating potentially existing relationship are significant um… partnerships, jobs or employment, families, sometimes children uh… community connections, so it's the strategy is different in that umm… the sort of the ripple the facts can look different than the ripple of facts to someone who is 14 or 15. Umm… somebody who is over the age of 18, they can access care through just an informed consents clinic and so they don't necessarily need the peripheral people in their life as much as young people do. 

00:27:15
GENDER DYSPHORIA IN CHILDREN 

00:27:20
Gender Dysphoria in Children: 

00:27:20
F64.2 (302.6) 

00:27:20
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Gender Dysphoria presents slightly differently in children than in adolescents and adults. Children's gender incongruence can be seen in their attire, their activities, their play, and their play mates. As these things tend to reflect what a stereo typically fought off (ph) for the opposite gender. Though justice with gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults, children may also identify with a gender different than they were assigned at birth. They may also want the sex characteristics of the opposite gender and dislike their own sex characteristics. 

00:27:55
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY It's incredibly where there a young person is able to disclose their gender in childhood. Frequently, umm… people may be don't have the language to make sense of it, or having any experience in so they're framing in a black I feel different, I feel like I don't fit in, umm… and so the misconception is that kids can't know their gender or they can understand their gender, with younger folks really most of my work is about educating and advocating the parents on behalf of… of the young person because when a young person its very interesting when he have gender dysphoria, if you disclose it three, four, five , six, seven or anything around that age, you're too younger possibly know your gender. But, if you disclose it 17, 18, 19, 20, you're too old why didn't you tell me when you are at three, four, five. So, there is really no good age to be Trans or have gender dysphoria and so part of my job is about contextualizing this for parents and understanding that when a young person discloses their gender to their parents, it's the starting point for parents but it's that journey has been happening for very long time for the young person. And so talking about the coming in process before the coming out process. Directly with the young person I spend I frame on a time correcting an accurate knowledge that they have been Googling, You Tubing umm… online for years and years, umm… and you can get some great information but there is a lot of really bore antiquated information in and so that can increase distress for people… The only thing is this strategizing for young people who were in school, how may I gonna negotiate PE and locker rooms how may I gonna negotiate dating in bathrooms, how may I gonna negotiate being disclose as a trans person of being non-disclosed having people not know my trans history. So, it's a lot of… tool building umm… and strategizing the realities as it for me again as, as both the trans person and as a clinician. Umm… my job is really to like be a contain and hold space for somebody and to spend a lot of time validating and not asking people to prove anything that anyone else would probably not be able to prove. And understanding this is true clinically curse the board, the children are not little adults, teenagers are not little adults and so, you doing a great harm if you don't know the specifics how to work with adolescents or kids… 

00:30:05
Gender Dysphoria in Children: 

00:30:05
F64.2 (302.6) 

00:30:05
SIOBHAN DOHERTY There are many positive opportunities offered with early intervention for children experiencing gender dysphoria. 

00:30:10
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY So, Kristina Allison (ph) is the research happen (inaudible )and surely he is even the first person who is conducted research about the positive outcomes specifically on social transition for younger pre-puber adult kids. So, there is no medical intervention for anyone that's not in puberty, all interventions for gender not confirming kids, pre-puberty is social transition, non permanent, reversible actions, they can really positively address symptoms of gender dysphoria. So, it's changing of clothes, hair, pronouns, it's the social presentation performance of gender. Not surprising for anyone who is doing this work, kids who socially transition or supported by families, of the charts, doing amazing, doing wonderful, and… and so, what has happen is that they date and research about how poorly trans and gender non-confirming kids do has been used to umm… make a statement of not supporting transition. And so her date and research says actually what the data says is that we need a support kids in social transition in early intervention because their outcomes are much better. So, if we can create upstairs of early intervention then we're going to absolutely create umm… healthier uh… more uh… well adjusted folks, the common point of that is not eradicating Trans identities, right. They were not trying to create a world where all Trans people looks as gender but, we have to remember and to take connected to reality is that if you an identifiable trans person, your life is at risk, and as a clinician and as an advocate educator, my job is to address the actuality of what is happening. So, if I can encourage somebody to have early intervention, so encourage their parents allow early intervention, I may be participating in life saving intervention 10 years from now and I have to think about that and I have to organize my career in that way. 

00:32:00
WORKING WITH COUPLES AND FAMILY MEMBERS 

00:32:00
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Jestice (ph) working with children with gender dysphoria will often intake coordinating with the childs, parents or care givers, the diagnostic and treatment process for any individual with gender dysphoria may involve working with the individual's family members.

CASEY WEITZMAN Recently, I've been able to work with these spouses because in the past, these spouses hated me because they always felt like I was changing their spouse and that you know, as a therapist I was the one that was doing, so I was pretty well hated. But in the last couple of years, more couples are staying together, so what I can work with couple it's more about how can we keep you guys together. So, it's a lot of compromise, it's a lot how we're going to work this out, will the spouse ever accept a complete change or if not, you know, it can be work out later, that person will go out a couple nights a week, they can take hormones but they can't have any either sex I mean the gender confirming surgeries or they can't they can have like breast augmentation but they can't umm… change their genitalia. So, its whatever works with the couples and so many more couples are now staying together which I think it is awesome. 

00:33:20
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY With adults, it's also spending some time potentially bringing in our partners significant other end or working with kids, marital (inaudible )to, to really bring every one at the same places saying this person umm… has done the most greatest thing they possibly could do something that most people aren't able to do and that's be the most authentic self they can possibly be. And parents and partners are like who have their relationship that they are loosing somebody, I mean what kind of frame not around grieving the death of that perception of that person that there was in. So, part of my job is also contextualizing that, of saying umm… you're grieving or you've lost your perception of somebody this stories. Uh… the ways you've organized hopes, dreams and wishes around this person but this person is very much here and the person who you love and care about is actually much more present now than they have ever been and so really helping people to can I like change the lines little bit around this amazing new information that people are inviting in to their world.

SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN Hello! Hi, yes! Okay, yeah, I was waiting and talk to someone because umm… I was told that I need to have my doctors … umm… send a note in so that can get my gender order changed or my ID because it's still says male right! Oh, why won't they'll be able to do it? But, that's not what I was told last time, I was told that all I had to do is bring in the my new ID and I had to bring in my social security card. But, I've… I'm sorry, I know… I might know that this isn't your fault but, it's just I've been waiting for like 6 months… 

00:35:05
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Socioeconomics place particularly pronounced role for individuals with gender dysphoria. As medical care will often involve not only therapy, but also medical procedures that can help the individual transition and experience congruence between the gender and their physical characteristics. 

00:35:20
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY So, even from me both issues myself and my practices and example, umm… I'm a private practice which means that I don't have any agency in organization, its subsidizing my income, and so I have to figure out how to have balance between what do I charge people to come in, to have a safe place this sort of talk about and explore and strategize around their gender umm… and because I don't bill insurance directly because insurance doesn't reimburse properly umm… appropriately over they take 6 months or more to reimburse at a fraction of what my hourly fee actually is, then I've to figure out how much am I going to participate in the exploitation of the community of people that are significantly impressed in all domains of their life. While maintaining ways to figure out how I pay my rents, alright. And that's a very difficult line to try to dance and balance, I've gain especially as a trans person whose been exploited by these systems that I'm a quiet participate in to be my authentic self. 

00:36:15
CASEY WEITZMAN I have worked with the population that has good insurance and can usually pay for the therapy, some of the therapies and some of the procedures that take place for example like hormone replacement therapy and sometimes even some of the surgeries but for most transgender people umm… when they decided a transition umm… sometimes they loose their jobs or their benefits and so we're trying out people that are almost on the poverty level. And so for this population umm… they don't have the luxury of going to a therapist. 

00:36:55
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY When we thinking about a group of people who have higher rate of suicide, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and other move disorders, unemployment, homogenous, street economy of writing different things over representation every category, every single category and were now going to ask those folks to access medical care that is overwhelmingly unaffordable for people who have a lot of resources were adding so many layers of disparity, and so if you are a trans woman of color living in even Northern California, right, like we don't any have to go to the extreme of like it may be the South, we're living in Northern California, certainly the South and Midwest , there is probably not access to mental health care, a medical care, so you're gonna out to figure out get into your car and drive 500 miles or take the bus or… or some how gets some inter transport, you that I mean I am on a mouse and if you're accessing a clinic that requires, 6 months of therapy and your therapist doesn't take your insurance and their rate is 150 dollars an hours and you can't get a job because you're trans woman and your house, your house isn't stable because you lost your family support or your partner support. You're not going to be able to transition, that's not going to happen and… and then we have a lot of feelings about somebody having impair functioning in their world when we look at all other domains there're so critical to our stability being unaccessible to… to folks. Umm… and so from providers, how do I… how do I negotiate, how do I create balance between my need to pay my rent and making sure somebody has access to what they have or what they need and it's tricky, its very, very tricky.

GENDER DYSPHORIA TREATMENT 

00:38:40
SIOBHAN DOHERTY As we've touched on previously, there can be different views as to whether the symptoms of gender dysphoria can ever fully abate or if gender dysphoria is a life long component of being a transgender individual. 

00:38:50
CASEY WEITZMAN Well, I think in most cases of gender dysphoria either ends or subsides when the person umm… does what they need to do to fill either true selves, so for some it could be counseling, for some it could be counseling and taking hormones that makes it can grown that their outside and their inside matches, from many it's have been the surgeries, so it's really how it goes away is that the person no longer feels depressed or anxious, and can grow up the world and feel confident and can work in that gender, can have relationships in that gender and no longer feel like they wanna die, or they wanna hide or they can live their lives as themselves. 

00:39:35
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY But parents and partners and people around can be very frustrated at why is this person still struggling? And so talking about generously as a life long experience, it is chronic condition, they can be umm… positively treated through medical interventions but the reality is I believe and many my colleagues would agree with me is that, that gender dysphoria is something that… that you have through the duration of your life. And are they going to be times that it's really loud? Absolutely! Are they going to be times that if feels pretty dormant? Yes! Umm… but, I've yet to meet a person professionally or personally and totally in my life who even, even twenty… I know somebody who've transition like 45 years ago and he talks about the ways gender dysphoria presents for him still and he's accessed every level of medical intervention available on that he's desired, and he still has experiences of gender dysphoria, that's not nothing for the duration of someone's life and when you have a chronic condition, you're severely impacted in so many ways and so talking to providers and parents about what is this look like? And what do we do? And recreating hopes and expectations for people, if you have any expectations that your… that your loved one is going to or your client is gonna arrive someday like alright, I'm fixed and I'm cured, I'm all good, my life is fantastic that may happen but it still going to happen under the layer of gender dysphoria. 

00:41:05
SIOBHAN DOHERTY While diagnosis can play a different part in every clinician process. It is ultimately only a starting point. One that can potentially offer the chance for the individual to find a mode of treatment or be referred to the appropriate health care provider, counselor or advocate. While these steps may not be necessary or helpful for all transgender individuals, for some they can hopefully put the individual on a positive experiencing a lessoning of distress in their daily life. 

00:41:35
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY There is an overwhelming amount of data in research about negative outcomes for transgender and non-confirming people. Well, we've fail to do is do data and research about how well adjusted trans people are umm… through the journey of transition and wherever they're landing (inaudible )for them individually. And so we look at in, we look at research, it's like 50% of trans people attempt suicide and these over representations an incur solutions enormous and all these things, any other thousands upon, thousands upon, thousands of trans people in the… in the world around us who are striving and doing really, really great. 

00:42:05
CASEY WEITZMAN There are so many misconceptions people can get their hell around umm… asking the person what's going on with them it's always something like there has to be kind of dysfunction, we'll in fact, when the person can be either true self (inaudible )gender dysphoria disappears. So, actually for a lot of these patients, it's the first time that they feel happy and normal, whatever normal is, but that they feel like they're the, they're true selves. So, I've seen lot of great, happy success stories when people leave my office. 

00:42:45
AYDIN OLSON-KENNEDY When I think about what I would say to the person who is, whose either just coming in or may be even somebody have been working with for a long time long, umm…and thinking about the messaging of hope really umm… is, is tough because I mean a, you know, the reality is that they're going to be people who will struggle their entire life. And that where they are right now is the very best it's going to be and my responsibility is a provider is to know that, and to understand that and to not tell people something so that I feel better about the long term of their life. Umm… and so does that mean that I spend all of my time talking about like this is probably is gonna, is gonna get. Now, umm… the end of the day, my clients don't want to hear it's gonna get better, they don't want to hear that because it's so invalidating and how terrible is right now. And so the best thing I can do is to be a witness of their pain in the moment, and not be one more person that is trying to water down so that every one around them feels better. So, is that a happy ending? I don't know is it, in my opinion the… the most appropriate thing that I can do clinically and the most human thing I can do it is and, and to tell about the person that I'm going to be both as a trans person, as a clinician, I'm going to be walking in soldierly with them as long as they would like me to be there and as long as I can be there and I have a believe system that there is going to be times or I'm going to be standing behind somebody, you know, not literally but figure looks standing behind somebody because they think that they're gonna fall and… and I got them and there's gonna be times I'm standing in front and I'm like come on, you can do this' I got you and reach your hand on his other times I meant to be walking shoulders, shoulder and he think that if my client know that I will occupy all three those positions sometimes with in a 50minute period, I think that… that creates a better sense of self and… and creates of efficacy and not create not faster dependency which sometimes their pick and faster dependency with people doing still the ability for somebody to say this might be difficult, this might be hard umm… but to not do it, is gonna be far more painful.
