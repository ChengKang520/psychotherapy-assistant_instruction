TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents JAY HALEY on CLINICAL HYPNOSIS Illustrated by Inductions of Milton H. Erickson MD in 1958 and 1964 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY I have seen miracle cures and I used to be a hypnotherapist practice. And there is something that doesn't you just can't explain remarkable changes. What he says what I unless do that with all the coins, but when it is effective it’s really effective. It also does another thing if you get some training in it. It gives you a… a perspective on change that different. You begin to feel that everything is changing. If a person has a headache they don’t have the… they can have the headache without feeling. Or they can have it very intensively for ten seconds and then not have it for another 24 hours that is everything is malleable when you work with hypnosis. You begin to think of changing the nature of the situation or the perception of whether the feelings at the time of it. And it helps a therapist become more flexible I think. It’s a training that’s difficult to get in clinical hypnosis. One of the to think about it too I think there is about three different kinds of hypnosis. There is the self hypnosis where you’re trying to do something yourself by a yoga hypnosis which has it’s own rules. Then there is a research hypnosis where you’re tying to find out what the extent of hypnosis influence is that they want to know if people can be deaf or blind or color blind or unable to move or you are… you are investigate the influence of the hypnotist on a subject and that’s been extensively investigated. And I don’t think that has anything to do with clinical hypnosis. Clinical hypnosis is when you are trying to use hypnosis to change somebody who wants to get over something. And so people are different as subjects in clinical hypnosis then in research where they pay a few bugs to me some. They are motivated differently and I think the only way you really learn clinical hypnosis is to watch somebody do it and then do it yourself or somebody watches you and improve your skills in it, which is what life simply(ph) means actually. It was always taught by live supervision and still is although nowadays it is often top people go for weekend seminar learning how to hypnotize and assume that's teaching them how to change people, but it really isn't. What happened with me is I learned it from Erickson in seminar and then I began to try it on everybody. We use to have hypnotic evenings, where people could come over and just experience hypnosis as subject or as hypnotism. So we did a lot of experience with a lot of people. And I did it and I learned how to hypnotize all kinds of people. And then I went into practice I realized all of a sudden I don’t know how to change anybody, I have been teaching courses in it but a woman came in with these dreadful headaches and I don’t know how to hypnotize, but I do know what to do about these headaches really. And then I could probably guess things to do, but one of the reasons I went down to consult with Erickson was because he was the only person allowed to do what it really that I'm in. But it’s a different hypnosis as what I getting it, it has different purpose. But at the same time it’s… it's so interesting which you can do with it when you start working that right. Like I had a women come to me who was starving till that, she was an older woman. And then I think we called an ambulance(ph), she went just (inaudible ). And she was in and out of the hospital and she came to me and I for hypnosis to get it because she was wasting life. So I got in a trance, she was a very good subject and I gave her a powerful post acknowledging gesture that she would have an appetite always. And she came back few days later and have been done with it really. So I knew that kind of a suggestion would work. So, what I did was say to her what I wanted her to have more training in hypnosis. I wanted her to examine her hand very carefully and noticed the colors of it and noticed that the forefinger is little larger than the little finger and so on. I went on and on talking about her hand. While I was saying and the middle finger is a little different from the forefinger and there is nothing more delicious than a peach when you bite into it and that juice comes into your mouth. The other side of the hand is different color than the back and went right on. But I dropped the suggestion in about a peach, in a way that she couldn’t do anything with it, because I was totally inappropriate you know. And she came in the next time and said you know, I had a funny kind of a thing, I’ve had this terrific training for peaches. And I don’t know whether you have something to do with it or not she had elusive(ph). It was very hard to remember an idea like that is inappropriate and so I said well as honestly I like peaches whether to matter and I put her back into trance let’s get the training you and I trained look at her hand and talked about green cheese and jelly sandwich, a sandwich and got her to eat a whole series of foods and gain weight without ever suggesting it directly and I was doing it in this way but she couldn't handle really because she was so preoccupied doing one thing and an idea coming out of nowhere it's very hard to integrate, so what she could do is follow this. It is an Erickson idea really. But what I’m getting out is a lot of people trying to get really eating couldn’t and I couldn’t with straight forward suggestion but there is always someway you can do it with hypnosis I think that way. And in anyway it’s… it’s a useful thing to learn even though you don't use it. Most people who go into hypnotic practice tend to use it for a while and then given up by (inaudible ). Erickson was a man who always uses it from beginning to end of his life, but not he was unusual. He began, he learned it when he was about 17. I think he was in first year of college I think. He saw a man in Howard(ph) hall do a demonstration at the college. So Erickson got the… the subject how it used and took him up to his room and did the same thing and hypnotized him. And then he began to experiment with different ways to hypnotize people for a whole summer and from then on the rest of his life and then where else he could. When he was a resident he could… a psychiatric resident he couldn’t use it. There was a such a condemnation of hypnosis by Freud. The psychiatrist wouldn’t allow to use it for 50 years, 1950… in the late 1950’s, the AMA approved. And before that resident just couldn't learn up that’s all and so the traveling seminars was the only way a hypnosis could be taught in psychiatry and it was mostly the position in Dallas and so on, because psychiatrist were scared to go, because it was condemned. Freud had a lot of power. He also did away with live supervision you know, but he gave up hypnosis and he trained therapist who went into a private office and nobody wants to and then he didn't watch anybody. So for 50 years nobody had any idea what an analyst said it is and then they didn’t know what other analyst did. I found that when I was researching therapy to find out what an analyst do is very difficult and they would raise doubts what they did? What they were supposed to do? But live supervision didn’t come up again till the 1950’s with the one-way mirror, so about half a century gone. Then anyway hypnosis is still a mystery. It’s… it’s a set of procedures which people know how to do and use in all kinds of way. But it is like electricity you know how to use it, but you are not to play on what it is. I want to put your hand on your knee and then I want you to feel and go lighter and lighter. I'm putting it there as voluntary feeling you get lighter and lighter is inbuilt(ph). The fastest induction in the world is called the Chicago induction where you ask a person to close their eyes and turn off the muscles to the eyelids. When they turned off try to open them and find they won't have, that's it. And closing your eyes is voluntary turning off the muscles, so you can’t open your eyes is involuntary. But it is the this is the same two steps in all the inductions. And Erickson was one of the first to get rid of or get away from rituals sort of inductions. Where you have people say we are going to point and count from 20 your relax starting with the top of the head, down to the toes all that. He did a conversational induction and he also did ritual ones. It varied in one of the things he did was whatever the personal thought would be the best thing to do, the subject he joined and withdrawing not the way, because he like to get together with people to do it in their framework and so it then looked liked he was doing it in a certain way but actually I was just giving to that particular subject. He had a range of… of working with people. He would… for example start a long monologue that would get dollar and dollar to the person who is having little trouble staying like (inaudible ). And then he would begin to emphasize certain words and make sentences of directives in that whole thing. He had an ability doing two or three things at once which was just extraordinary to me. He can give a lecture and hypnotize somebody in the audience by just emphasizing certain sentence or by telling an anagoges to happen to have the names of a person in the audience. And then whatever he did was related to that person and he would do that because he get bored just giving a lecture. He… he can't do act of a mind in someway. He was always experiment when influencing people that’s why people were scared of him. If he went to a party, he would trying to get somebody to move from that chair over to that chair without ever saying they should and if he did that he was pleased that was… that… that made us evening. I remember I had dinner one time at San Francisco with John Linton and John reached for a glass of water and his hands stopped. And he said no I can’t reach for that glass of water and I think you might have something to do with it. Then Erickson said would you like to have the glass of water and John said yes I’m thirsty. And Erickson said well you can have it. And then John's hand could move and he drank the water we never did know how he did that. It is possibly because… I mean that's he use to scare people, Ridley Bent(ph), Gregory Bent(ph) was afraid of him. (inaudible ) very much like him, because Erickson never to stop getting around that. But he was doing it partly for reason and that was to figure out he did this, the person would do that. Then he would use that clinically because he was had been practicing on people for 34 years you know. So what he wanted to do something to somebody who was very good at. And then it is really not an awful lot of material on him in his prime. I'll show you a tape of him in 58, when he was in good shape, but it is not a very good film contently. We did a research film on the camera way away from… from well we should have done some close ups. And the more interesting one where he hypnotizes say as women at a demonstration what he did was every two weeks someone in the country he demonstrated hypnosis, it went on row and did weekend workshops. And he would ask for volunteers and have them come up. And this particular one is the a medical lady and he also volunteered that turned out to be Harlem sometimes as we(ph)… and he did you know in 5 or 10 minutes with each one and I think it's interesting when he did it. It raises questions about the nature of hypnosis is interesting. But I think what he did was increased the mystery of it in some ways. Because he managed to do it, he did one in Mexico when he didn’t know Spanish and the girl he was working with she didn’t know English and he produced that anesthesia in the hand when she didn't know he was a hypnotist. Just to demonstrate, but he didn’t have to call it hypnosis and he didn’t have to. He did it all with nonverbal behavior like he drew a picture on his hand and pinched it and smile then he drew a circle on her hand and pinched it lightly. Although he didn't have any problem that's right and he said like you are hurting me, did it on her hand on her hand and pinched, it didn’t hurt. Then he did again on his hand and pinched it and he just smiled. And then he did it on her hand and pinched it and she just smile, she didn't feel it that is he produced an anesthesia by a simple kind of a procedure like that which raises a question what he need all his extraordinary complexity of words that he used, and some how what purpose, but its where he is more question and he did a lots of research on it and he did, because of the bias of the laboratory, he didn’t know a social research. And once he would a have a seminar going that might not even be about hypnosis and he would do something in that seminar. I can’t remember thing he did wasn't interesting. He was… I decided what he was doing he was producing the classical double mind, but he was demonstrating that you can get somebody to forget something by reminding of them crookedly(ph) or something like it. May be what he did is he sat in a seminar and he would arranges with the group and one guy was (inaudible ), he seen to the guy beside him who was a chain smoker and he didn’t have any cigarettes. So Erickson conducted this seminar at certain point Erickson took out a cigarette and he turn to offer to the guy. And somebody ask Erickson a question so Erickson pulled the cigarette away where the guy could take it and answered the question. And then he forgot cigarettes, little while later he took and he offered the cigarette to the guy and as the guy reached out for it somebody else asking a question. And Erickson took it way and the guy couldn't blame Erickson because obviously he was answering a question of some importance by somebody in the group, but he wasn’t getting a cigarette. And Erickson did this four or five times and then at the end of the seminar he opened up a discussion and somebody asked the guy did you ever get that cigarette, he said what cigarette? And when they enquired he had no memory of it, of reaching for that cigarette five or six times. This… this leading somebody on and then inadvertently depriving them. We were interested in terms of what is this is what wise people are crazy or whatever, but you are being offered something in a way that you… you never get it. But he like to expel that kind of thing and now what else I know has ever done this. If they did it they would do it in a formal laboratory experiment instead of this way so that it would be, it would be more casual and then formal. Let me show you what it look like in this brunt(ph). Yeah I will started to give member sitting members saw Erickson stand up because he always knew on his old ages in a wheelchair. And (inaudible ) Erickson standing up because I knew him while he was in good shape and I did know him as well when he was at a wheelchair. So this is a tape of him talking to a young man, he is a volunteer. We want to make a research tape on him doing a deep induction and me wanted him start fresh with this young man. But he never started fresh, he met the young man at the social gallery in the (inaudible ) and did this full round. And then the next day we started the camera on this and filmed him with the young man. He is a student Stafford and he… he volunteered for this because he is not a patient that's what I mean he is just a guy, a volunteer. And they are sitting in a room and we were just building a one-way mirror at that time. 

00:18:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON We get started because it is slightly different that your(ph) hearing way, eventually we felt one thing that one-way mirror. I think I don't hear(ph) someone who likes the cigarette… 

00:18:40
Ah… may be. 

00:18:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON Is it what the other, you want about the meaning it’s a one-way mirror or to be really careful when you people talk that. 

00:18:50
Certainly. 

00:18:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON You know I wonder if I'm really to get what is it, you could see that. 

00:19:00
JAY HALEY Erickson never made small talk and never said anything irrelevant to what is has worked. So you can assume that as he is chatting with this young man he was purposefully saying when he is saying something like you and I are together against those other people behind one-way mirror and sort of things. 

00:19:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do you know anything(ph) about the experimental work that they don't hear. Whether they are aware of the fact that they can betray themselves through a one-way mirror. But you know when the first time we met the other words that you are not quite in this position, I was little around your, left side, isn't it? 

00:19:35
And that's right, on my right side. 

00:19:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON And that’s right, on your right side. 

00:19:45
JAY HALEY Erickson also never makes an error. He haven’t say that about many people if he says I was on your left side and they guy corrects it. He wants the guy to correct because that there will be more real to the guy if the guy says well it wasn’t, incorrect Erickson, then if Erickson says. So he would often make little mistakes for somebody who corrects him then that will be their contribution. But he is also doing something else, one of the curious things about hypnosis is that if you hypnotize somebody and then later you recall to their mind that instead they tend to go right into trance. So he is recalling to this young man what happened the night before and then the process he don’t have to be getting people into the trace. 

00:20:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON And let’s see, there is (inaudible ) over slightly to the left of the room! 

00:20:35
Yes! 

00:20:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON But we're saying general relative position where Bateson(ph) is right now. 

00:20:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON Uh…Huh… 

00:20:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON And I don't remember where any of the other's were, but they were scattered around. It was rather silent as they listened to what I had to say to you. And one of the things I’ve mentioned to you is… is question of feeling yourself. Do you recall? 

00:21:00
Yes, I remember it, yes. 

00:21:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON And if you remember that, do you remember just what happened to you (inaudible )? You felt yourself doing what? That’s right. You felt yourself going into a trance as you’ll recall, just as you are going into a trance right now. And I don't like (inaudible ) feeling yourself in a different position, in a different position in this room and you’re in right now. And close your eyes and sleep deeply. And feel yourself in a different position in this room. 

00:21:55
JAY HALEY Erickson made a big issue of spatial position. And he would, for example, if he was seeing a husband and wife, he would send the wife out of the room and then he would has the husband to sit where the wife had been sitting. He did a lot moving people on their chairs. And then he’d say to the guy, why do you sit where your wife is sitting, and see some of her perspective on that situation. And he felt that the guy would have more of her perspective if he… if he said where she was sitting. So, he makes quite an issue of space. And he thinks it's independent of how your eyes open and close, that you can talk to a subject when eye is closed, and you can move your head, then the subject knows exactly where your head is, (inaudible ) located this out. 

00:22:41
MILTON H. ERICKSON (Inaudible ) still there running back and I don’t like that you feel yourself going deeper and deeper into the trance. I wonder what you would like to do in the trance state? 

00:23:00
JAY HALEY This is also a typical(ph) hypnosis, those who aren’t familiar with the theme, he sort of imposed your will on theme. But really you’ll find out what people want to do and then you work within that framework as much as you can and then they’re more involved in doing it. 

00:23:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON (Inaudible )? 

00:23:25
(inaudible ) 

00:23:26
MILTON H. ERICKSON And I’d like to have you think about that and then I would like to have you wonder what other topic could come up. And I wonder if you would like to look over in the there, over there. And I wonder what the visualization you could achieve as you look over there? 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY One of the sad things to me was that, he… probably a therapist should have absolute control with his or her movement and then her… his or her intonations and voice, so that you could say something with a slight inflection and that person would pick that up, or that you could point like that when you want somebody to look at something. And the tragedy was he lost that as he got old, and within wheelchair. He lost his movement, he lost his voice so that he could hardly speak, which with other therapists that did not matter so much, but with him that was so important, really. But he ended up only able to do is tell stories. So, a lot of people developed that theory, but that’s what his therapy was, he was telling stories, you know. But that's all he can do. 

00:24:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON I wonder if you could see a movie or a screen of some sort? 

00:24:50
I can see a screen. 

00:24:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON You can see a screen. I’d like to have you see a table of statistics on that screen. And I’d like to have you wonder what they are? Can it probably of no particular interest, and then I would like to have you see something besides the statistics, something that will interest, something pleasing. That’s right! And begin to see something pleasing and interesting, very pleasing and very interesting that involves motion and activity. That’s it! 

00:25:50
JAY HALEY Interesting interview and that sense that he does a variety of (inaudible ) with this young man and taking him back to childhood where he gets younger. Now, this is a film, it’s a strange film, everybody looks stranger, the boy has kind of a skill. And everybody sort of watched out looking straight. But it’s one of the few of these demonstrations that exist. This is 1964. It’s (inaudible ). 

00:26:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON Tell me, have you ever been in a hypnotic trance before? Have you ever seen one? 

00:26:35
SALLY DORRIS (ph) No! 

00:26:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do you know what it’s like go into a hypnotic trance? 

00:26:40
SALLY DORRIS (ph) No! 

00:26:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do you know that you’ve to do all the work, because I just sit by and enjoy watching you work? 

00:26:50
SALLY DORRIS (ph) No, I didn’t know it. 

00:26:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON You didn’t know that? Well, I’m really going to enjoy watching you work. And the first thing I’m going to do is this, I’m going to take a hold your hand like this, and when you lift up like that (inaudible ). 

00:27:10
[sil.] 

00:27:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON And close your eyes. And go deeply. 

00:27:25
JAY HALEY And… He has a way at sometimes of saying that, to the subject that you’re in charge of going into trance, I’m just going with you. And some people, they’ll make that a method would say do with every case, it’s funny. But he’s really, for some reason doing that with her. Everything he says also, if you really analyze has a double meaning. When he says, have you been on the trance before? It just a question like have you previously had something happen, but it’s also a statement she learns to trance now, when he says that with that phrase. Everything has a special meaning. 

00:28:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON And go deeply soundly asleep, so deeply so sound asleep. So deeply, so soundly asleep that you could undergo an operation, that anything legitimate could happen to you. Now, I’m going to surprise you a little bit, but that’s alright, I’ll be very-very careful about it. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON And are you comfortable? 

00:28:45
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Yes. 

00:28:50
JAY HALEY One of the ways to think about hypnosis is that it deals with the most important question that you like, which is how much power would you like somebody have over you? And that’s… that’s always a mixture of, it’s nice to have somebody have power over you, because it’s protective. But it’s also dangerous, because they might exploit you some day. And he always plays with that answer. And what he says to her is that anything legitimate can be done, making you protective. And then he takes her ankle, which is kind of threatening. And yet he says, it won’t bother. So that it’s his mixture of imposing yourself and not imposing yourself that makes the attention in hypnosis. 

00:29:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON And you may nod your head again. And do you have an ordinary person nods the head? You would really don’t, but they nod it this way and you nod it this way. And you don’t know what I’m talking (inaudible ) and now your hand is going to lift up toward your face. And when it touches your face you’ll take a deep breath and go away deep sound asleep. 

00:30:15
JAY HALEY He just wants to know how they’re with you and how much they are not. So, if you have them lift a hand, you say when it touches your face, you go deeply into the trance. If the hand hesitates you know they’re worried about that. If it goes right (inaudible ) you know they’re not worried about that. But it’s your way of finding a kind of feedback all the time, which is what he’ll just do. 

00:30:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON And you didn’t really know that it was that easy, did you? And it’s so far different from the show-off stage hypnosis, isn’t it? Because you realize that you are the one that’s really doing it. And you know that, do you not? I’m going to ask you to open your eyes. Hi! Have you been in a trance? 

00:31:15
SALLY DORRIS (ph) I don’t know. 

00:31:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON You don’t know? You really… 

00:31:15
JAY HALEY One of the things he does with this (inaudible ) as he… he was the master of producing amnesia. And one of the ways he does with her three to four times, as he awakes her up and then he speaks to her in a way that’s appropriate if she just sat down. And therefore, she tends to forget what happened. So, he has opened her eyes and then he says, hi. Have you ever been in a trace before? Which is the kind of thing you would say if she just sat down. So she… it… it gives her the feeling she just sat down. And he does this two or three times with her. 

00:31:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON Well, I’ll tell you the way to find out, watch your eyelids to see if they start closing on you. 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:10
MILTON H. ERICKSON And if they start closing on you, that will mean you’ve been in a trance. And down they go. 

00:32:25
[sil.] 

00:32:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON That’s beautiful. Down they go. (crosstalk)(inaudible) That’s beautiful. Down they go. All the way now, all the way, all the way and they stay shut. And now, all that proof came from within you, did it not? 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:33:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON And you can talk, and you can understand, and you can hear. 

00:33:20
JAY HALEY Usually, you say that to somebody if you’re worried about them being in a very deep trance, because sometimes people haven’t ever been in one don’t know they can talk, and hear. And so, they just sort of go out of it. So, he’s listening the things she’s capable of doing even though in the track. 

00:33:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON And you can obey instructions. For example, if I ask you to lift your right arm, you can lift your right arm. And it’s slowly lifting up. Now it stopped right there. Do you know, no matter what you’re trying to do it stay right there. Now really try hard to put it down. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:15
JAY HALEY (Inaudible ) has a challenge of some kind. Where you challenge the subject to try to resist you and find they can. And that… once that happens, then they’re into a deeper state or whatever this is. So, he does it sometimes suddenly and sometimes as directly as that. 

00:34:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON First time in your life have you ever experienced such difficulty in lowering your hand, isn’t that right? Isn’t it challenging? Isn’t it interesting? 

00:34:45
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Uh…Huh… 

00:34:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON That’s right! 

00:34:50
JAY HALEY That can be frightening when you… if you’ve ever had them and you just can’t move an arm, and he makes it (inaudible ). 

00:35:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON And now tell me, do you think that you’ll believe that you’ve been in a trance, if I had really opened your eyes and waked you up right away? 

00:35:10
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Yes. 

00:35:10
MILTON H. ERICKSON Well, I’d like to have you believe that you can’t be hypnotized, is that alright? 

00:35:20
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Certainly! 

00:35:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON Alright! Now, you can’t really be hypnotized, as soon as you open your eyes you’ll know that. 

00:35:30
[sil.] 

00:35:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Tell me, do you think you’ve been be hypnotized? 

00:35:40
No! I don’t think so. 

00:35:45
JAY HALEY (Inaudible ) if she just sat down, but that’s a double-bind in the sense that you give somebody the post-hypnotic suggestion to say they haven’t been in trance, if they follow the suggestion, they must have been in a trance, that it’s not way out of it. And usually you do that with more difficult subjects and she’s very cooperative. He just illustrated how to do it. 

00:36:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON You really don’t? 

00:36:10
SALLY DORRIS (ph) No! 

00:36:10
MILTON H. ERICKSON Now, I’d like to have you explain this one little thing. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON And did you ever have a strange man lift your hand and leave it in midair like that before? 

00:36:35
SALLY DORRIS (ph) No! 

00:36:40
JAY HALEY The curious things about two is you can put a part of the body in trance. I mean, she behaves as if she’s quite wide awake, but she has got hands up in the air. And some people who are reluctant to go into a trance, you can say, well let’s just put your arms into trance. And they’ll have the sensation of the arm is, but they’re wide awake. And I’m sure she has that sensation now. 

00:37:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON Did you know that in hypnosis, in medical hypnosis sometimes you want a patient hold very-very still, so that you can do an operation, do all manner of things with the patient’s full cooperation. And you know in doing operation you haven’t got time to explain to a patient exactly what they should do. For example, if I told you to close your eyes, you close it. Now… 

00:37:45
JAY HALEY And he also does this, interesting if you like communication. As he makes a for example, which is a hypothetical situation. And then within the framework, that for example, you tell somebody what to do, it’s no longer a hypothetical metaphor. And that is a mixture that if he says, for example, you tend to not mind it, because that’s gonna be a mild thing and then within that framework he gets more (inaudible ). 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON You can close them so nicely, and keep them closed so nicely. And surgically that might be a most important thing. And the immobility of your right arm might be a most important thing surgically. Now you know medical hypnosis is far different from a stage hypnosis. The stage hypnosis is where somebody throws out his chest and widens his eyes and tells the audience what a great man he is. But I would like to have you understand it’s that you as a person are really a very great person, able to do a lot of things that will help you medically. Does that make you feel happy? Now, I don’t know what your future is going to be, but I hope that if you ever get married and have a baby, that you’d have it very comfortably and easily. If you have an operation you’d it comfortably and easily. That any surgery that you can have will be comfortable and easy. Any dental work… 

00:39:55
JAY HALEY He also rewards the subject in some way for coming up and voluntarily with part (inaudible ). 

00:40:01
MILTON H. ERICKSON Does that seems agreeable to you? 

00:40:05
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Very. 

00:40:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON Very, very? 

00:40:05
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Yes! 

00:40:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON I’m so glad of that. And I hope you’ll keep that knowledge with you for all the rest of your life. And it isn’t really ever important for you to know that I hypnotized you. The important thing is for you to know that you did it all by yourself. Now I’d like you to take one or two or three deep breaths and wake up wide awake. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON Hi! Dorris(ph), tell me what is your first name? 

00:40:50
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Sally. 

00:40:50
JAY HALEY Once again he says what will be appropriate when she sat down, what’s your first name? And that has a powerful impose to forget what… what’s gone before. 

00:41:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON Sally? 

00:41:00
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Yes. 

00:41:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON Well, I guess that’s a nice name? Would like to shake hands with me? 

00:41:10
SALLY DORRIS (ph) I’d like to. 

00:41:10
You would? You know, you’re shaking hands with me in a rather… 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON And did you know that you’d go into a trance that quickly and that easily? 

00:41:35
SALLY DORRIS (ph) No! 

00:41:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON But you can, can’t you? Even with your eyes wide open. You know that if you want to, you can see just you and me and nothing else. 

00:41:55
JAY HALEY Well, the definitions of a deep trance is… is a concentration in which you just see (inaudible ), which is the hypnotist felt, that’s what he’s suggesting there. 

00:42:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON …frequency or anything of that sort. And your hand and arm feel so comfortable. Now close your eyes. That’s right, all the way, take a deep breath and wake up. Let me shake hands again. Hi Sally, I’m so glad to meet you. It’s been a pleasure to know you! 

00:42:30
JAY HALEY One of the things he’s done is just dropped that trance right off in the middle of the handshake. And what you can do with that, I’m done it with patients. And you can… There’s some way we make a continuity, that we have to make a continuity. And you can start to… you can do a shaking hands or you can do it… you just start with the patients and you lean back and say something like, well let’s say this is Monday, but it could be… And then you lean forward, and you work with hypnosis for hours(ph). And then you lean back and say, Tuesday or even Wednesday it could be… And that the hour would disappear from their memory, because they’ll connect what you said at the beginning and what you said here and put them together. And it’s same with that handshake. When he shakes hands it goes through a whole bunch of things, when they shake hands again she has a tremendous impulse to just believe nothing happened in that middle, you know. It's a way to produce amnesia when you want to give suggestions without the person knowing you you’ve given them, you want them to forget about it. One of the complications of producing amnesia is that you suggest somebody to forget something, it's different than if you arrange the situation so they forget, which is what Erickson was so good at it. 

00:43:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON And thank you so much for helping me. 

00:44:00
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Thank you. 

00:44:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do you realize you really helped me a great deal? 

00:44:05
SALLY DORRIS (ph) I have? 

00:44:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON I’ve taken away, I hope a lot of the mystery of the stage of hypnotists and all the other charlatans trying to put upon the hypnosis. 

00:44:15
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Thank you. 

00:44:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON And I’m very grateful to you. (Inaudible )? 

00:44:25
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Uh…Huh… 

00:44:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON That’s good! Now do you suppose we were like have you changed seats with somebody else? 

00:44:30
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Yes I’m. 

00:44:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Alright. 

00:44:35
SALLY DORRIS (ph) Thank you. 

00:44:40
[sil.] 

00:44:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON The girl with a blue dress. 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:45:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON Tell me, have you ever been in a trance before? 

00:45:05
I think so. 

00:45:10
MILTON H. ERICKSON You think so? (Inaudible ) trance before? 

00:45:16
Dr. Yanovski(ph). 

00:45:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON Dr. Yanovski(ph). That was very nice of you. 

00:45:25
I enjoyed it. 

00:45:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON You enjoyed it? 

00:45:25
Umm… 

00:45:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON And when do you think you’ll go into a trance for me? 

00:45:35
You know when my arm feels, I would imagine I might be in one now. 

00:45:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON When your arm feels you might be in a trance right now? 

00:45:45
Yes of course. 

00:45:45
JAY HALEY He was doing as a absolutely Rogerian(ph) induction. He just repeats back everything she says. With each of these women he does a different kind of an induction, you know. 

00:45:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON In what way does your arm feel different? 

00:46:00
It singles. 

00:46:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON It singles! It's a part for you? 

00:46:05
No it… it… it singles. You know it singles. 

00:46:10
MILTON H. ERICKSON Is it just same tingling? 

00:46:10
JAY HALEY Well, that’s a… that’s again an example of just got out of the (inaudible ) of how he doesn’t make an error. He… He knows perfectly well what she said, you know, when she said tingling. 

00:46:25
Now, now it singles. My hand… Well now may be it’s singles. It doesn’t seem to be so much a part of me as it was before. 

00:46:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Are your eyes open? 

00:46:35
Wide open. 

00:46:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Are your sure of that? 

00:46:40
Right now I am. 

00:46:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON Right now you are? 

00:46:40
Uh…Huh… 

00:46:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON You still be sure of it? 

00:46:50
Yes. 

00:46:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON Are they closing? 

00:46:55
Not yet. 

00:46:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON Are you sure? 

00:47:00
Yes. 

00:47:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON All the way, all the way. 

00:47:10
[sil.] 

00:47:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON And staying shut all the way, all the way. 

00:47:25
[sil.] 

00:47:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON All the way shut now. And take a deep breath and go way deep into a trance. And in any future hypnosis, whether it’s medical or dental, I hope you'll enjoy it thoroughly. And I hope that never, never would you use hypnosis to entertain people or to instruct them or to make them much more aware. And do you mind if I talk about you? 

00:48:10
No. 

00:48:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON So that make you self-conscious person. 

00:48:20
No, not when you’re at trance. 

00:48:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON Not when you're in trance, but you can make a response to me. Isn’t that right? 

00:48:30
Yes I can. 

00:48:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON And all of your surroundings seem (inaudible ). 

00:48:40
That’s right, I’m only conscious to hear your voice. 

00:48:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON You are only conscious of my voice, (inaudible )? 

00:48:50
Oh yes! 

00:48:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON Because you’re here for a medical purpose to demonstrate various things, and so take a deep breath and rouse up completely rested and refreshed and energetic. Do you think you’re wide awake? 

00:49:15
Well, I don’t know. No, I don’t. I can’t get my arm down. 

00:49:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON You can’t get your arm down? 

00:49:25
No. 

00:49:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do you mean your arm is still asleep? 

00:49:30
Yes it is. 

00:49:35
JAY HALEY Anybody like to speculate on why she can't get her arm down? 

00:49:40
He saw when it was up. 

00:49:40
JAY HALEY That wouldn’t do it. He’s probably holding it, because that was his bad arm and he moves it to keep it moving. 

00:49:50
I think he… then he lifted there and then he started her to down it. 

00:49:55
JAY HALEY When he has told her to wake up, wide awake. 

00:49:55
Well I imagine she’s still on a trance. 

00:50:00
JAY HALEY She’s still on a trance, yeah, but he woke her up. 

00:50:05
For me, I think she’s still on the trance. 

00:50:05
JAY HALEY Well, I don’t think he… he was a… 

00:50:05
Even though she… Even though she, you know, she’s awake. 

00:50:10
She didn’t (inaudible ). 

00:50:11
JAY HALEY Well, why didn’t she wake up? That’s the question. 

00:50:11
Well, he wasn’t specific enough. He told her to wake up, but he didn’t tell her to put the arm down. 

00:50:15
JAY HALEY But usually if you have a phenomena of some kind and you ask people to wake up, they’ll wake up and drop their arm. 

00:50:25
That’s true. 

00:50:25
JAY HALEY And that’s what she expected and then her hand stayed up. 

00:50:30
He didn’t say wake up, but he said arouse. 

00:50:30
JAY HALEY No, let's hear what he said. 

00:50:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Take a deep breath, arouse and completely rested and refreshed and energetic. Do you think you're wide awake? 

00:50:50
Well, I don't know. No, I don’t. I can’t get my arm down. 

00:50:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON You can’t get your arm down? 

00:50:55
No! 

00:51:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do mean that your arm is still asleep? 

00:51:00
Yes it is. 

00:51:05
JAY HALEY Well, actually what I think he did, when I talked to… And what he told me by the way was that he was ill that day and ah… just wanted to get the job done and leave, because he wasn’t feeling well. So this is how it works when he doesn’t feel well. Watch what happens when he hypnotizes. 

00:51:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON Tell me, have you ever been in a trance before? 

00:51:25
I think so. 

00:51:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON You think so? 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON (Inaudible ) to the trance before? 

00:51:36
Dr. Yanovski(ph). 

00:51:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON Dr. Yanovski(ph)? That was very nice of you. 

00:51:45
I enjoyed it. 

00:51:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON You enjoyed it. 

00:51:45
Uh…Huh… 

00:51:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON And when do you think you’ll go into a trance for me? 

00:51:55
[sil.] 

00:52:00
JAY HALEY Then there’s one possible explanation is this two trances involved. One is that a trance with Dr. Yanovksi(ph) and then he says, when you will go into trance for me? As soon as she says that she was once hypnotized by somebody else, he then sets this up. And even singles off that hand, which is Dr. Yanovski's(ph) trance. So later he awakes her from his trance, which is Dr. Yanovski's(ph) trance and her arm is still up in the air. And he waited… He did that so fast as soon as she sat down and said that. 

00:52:35
Interesting! 

00:52:40
JAY HALEY It’s a curious thing that if you want to hypnotize somebody and you ask them if they've been hypnotized before and they say, yes by doctor so on so. As you talk about that they’ll being to go into a trance. Although sometimes you can say ah… that's some of the works very similar to the way I work and you begin to get into him with his set. Now, when you… When you talk about cases you… you first say did that person or did you hypnotize that person. And afterward you stop asking, because whatever he did there was no difference when you hypnotize (inaudible ). This is his whole manner was that way. It was a way he related to somebody. But I think it’s a good training to get. It's just hard to get a clinical trainee or you could watch somebody do it and you can do it and be watched at, that's how hard training is defined. (Inaudible ) in his old age was very good. I remember looking at one of… I’ve been looking recently at some of his later work, which I didn't realize was good as it is while he was an old man on a wheelchair who can hardly talk. And I watched one where there was a young woman he was hypnotizing. And she didn’t look like she was responding at all. And I was thinking why Erickson is really over the hill by that time? And then he turned and pointed to the floor and he said, would you ever have the black and white puppy on the ground (inaudible )? And she said the brown and white puppy and there were no puppies on the floor. So, whatever he was doing he was preparing for that. Well, okay for today.
