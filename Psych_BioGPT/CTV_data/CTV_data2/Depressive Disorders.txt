DIAGNOSING MENTAL DISORDERS 

00:00:00
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 

00:00:05
DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS 

00:00:10
JIM HARRIGAN Our mood can often shape our perception of our own situation. The perceptions of our world can influence our overall state of happiness and wellbeing just as much, if not more than the circumstances we find ourselves in. For those people with mood disorders, this can be a harrowing concept, since the individual psychological disorder can make it hard or even impossible for a person to see their circumstances in a favorable light. This is especially true of patients with depressive disorders, a subset of mood disorders, in which the individual experiences episodes of sorrow, lethargy, and even a complete lack of energy and excitement about life. Mood is defined as the prolonged emotions that color a person's perceptions of the world. Within this category of mood disorders, are two groups of disorders. These are depressive disorders, and bipolar and related disorders. Both of these groups share the common trades of mood disorders. However, well, bipolar and related disorders feature manic or hypomanic episodes and symptoms, in which the individual feels elated and energized. Depressive disorders are marked by major depressive episodes or symptoms, in which the individual has difficulty enjoying life. These symptoms can manifest themselves in a variety of disorders, differing in duration, timing, underlying causes, and other more subtle specifics. 

00:02:00
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:02:05
JIM HARRIGAN The depressive disorders grouping in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders or DSM-5 contains a number of distinct disorders, each given it's own unique diagnostic code. These codes correspond to the codes used by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorder is first linked to the coding system from the ICD-9 with the codes for the ICD-10 listed in parenthesis after. Hence, all of the DSM codes crosswalk to the ICD codes, including the newest iteration ICD-10. For instance, major depressive disorder with a single episode, mild, is assigned the code 296.21 from the ICD-9 and F32.0 in parenthesis from the ICD-10. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10 was released in the fall of 2015, in the United States, although it was adopted previously in other countries. However, because ICD-10 is now the standard in the United States, this program will be listing the newer code from ICD-10 first, followed by the ICD-9 codes in parenthesis. The coding for other specifications of major depressive disorder depends on, if the episode is single or recurrent, and can be further delineated by descriptors to indicate the episode's severity, if it had psychotic features, the stage of remission that it is in, or if it is unspecified. The appropriate order is, the name of the disorder, if it is a single or recurrent episode, severity psychotic remission specifiers, followed by any additional specifiers. Sometimes, when relevant, we will also delineate the ICD-9 and 10 codes, when we mention a disorder from one of the other chapters of DSM-5. For example, to use one of the bipolar and related disorders mentioned earlier in this program, Bipolar I disorder, with the current or most recent episode manic and mild, is coded as F31.11 (296.41), part of the F30 to F39 section of the ICD-10 on mood affective disorders. Organizationally, there are few differences between the layouts of the DSM-5 and the ICD-10. The ICD-10 puts depressive disorders into their larger section on mood affective disorders in their F30 to F39 block. And many of the depressive and bipolar disorders that are separate in DSM-5 are mixed together in the ICD-10. For example, dysthymia, referred to as persistent depressive disorder (Dysthymia) in DSM-5, and cyclothymia, a bipolar related disorder in DSM-5, are both placed in the F34 section of the ICD-10 for persistent mood affective disorders. While the ICD-10 grouping of all mood disorders into a larger section may seem like a minor organizational difference. It does further illuminate the underlying similarities between depressive and bipolar disorders, which we will highlight throughout this program and in that on bipolar disorders. Two other major differences are with substance or medication-induced depressive disorder. And depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The ICD-10 puts what they call mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance abuse in the F10 block. And organic, including symptomatic disorders in the F00 to F09, specifically F06, or other mental disorders due to brain damage and dysfunction and to physical disease. In this case, the code is for FO6.3 for organic mood affective disorder. 

00:06:55
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 

00:07:00
JIM HARRIGAN Major depressive disorder is the most prevalent of the depressive disorders affecting 7 percent of the population. This can be even higher in females, since they experience a 2:1 preponderance to males. However, despite the high prevalence, only one out of three individuals experiencing major depressive disorder seek treatment. An individual with major depressive disorder may experience a depressed mood, loss of pleasure, fatigue, problems with sleeping, weight loss, and more, happening for the majority of time during a specific time period lasting at least two weeks. This is categorized as a major depressive episode, one of three mood episodes, because this episode is such a significant aspect of the diagnosis for major depressive disorder. We will first take a closer look at mood episodes, then major depressive episodes, before further exploring how these episodes tie into a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.

FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS 

00:08:20
JIM HARRIGAN A mood episode is a specific period of time where an individual feels abnormally energized and elevated, or alternatively depressed. The presence and repetition or lack there of, of these episodes affects the coding of the disorder. But even beyond that, these mood episodes can be considered the basis of some disorders, as they are for major depressive disorder. In addition to depressive episodes, there are manic episodes in which the individual experiences at least a week of increased energy or activity and the less severe hypomanic episodes which feature the same symptoms, but to a less debilitating extent. For both of these episodes, the individual may experience racing thoughts, a need for less sleep, overly increased self-esteem, distractibility, or excessive poor judgment regarding dangerous activities among other symptoms. While these are worth mentioning to contrast them against a major depressive episode, the presence of a manic or hypomanic episode will change the patient's diagnosis to a bipolar or a related disorder. And so we will explore them in greater detail in our program on bipolar disorders.

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 

00:09:50
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE 

00:09:55
JIM HARRIGAN A major depressive episode has a number of characteristic features, which take place most of the day, nearly every day, where relevant. The two main characteristics are a depressed mood, and a noticeably decreased interest in most activities. Other characteristics include trouble sleeping, diminished hunger or pronounced weight loss, trouble concentrating or making decisions, fatigue or loss of energy, recurring suicidal thoughts with or without intent to act on these thoughts, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and feelings of low self-worth or pronounced guilt. These symptoms must cause marked distress in the patient's work or social life. For all of these episodes the clinician should ensure that the symptoms are not better explained by another medical condition or by the affects of a substance. 

00:11:00
HANNAH HUFF No, I know, I don't think that there is a normal response. How are you supposed to get over something like this? He was here and now he's gone. He's just not around anymore. This… he was a person who's, who's life is just gone. 

00:11:20
JIM HARRIGAN For a major depressive episode, the clinician should carefully consider its part in the diagnosis, if the patient has recently experienced a significant loss. While the DSM-4 allowed for a bereavement exclusion, this is absent in the DSM-5. Some clinicians claim this is because depression linked to the death or a loss of a loved one, doesn't greatly differ from other causes of depression. Still, in these cases, the clinician should factor in cultural norms, the patients history, the severity of the symptoms, and whether or not the patient seems to improve before making their diagnosis. There are ways for the clinician to distinguish between grief and a major depressive episode. Grief decreases over time, and may become more present when thinking of the deceased. A major depressive episode on the other hand, is more constant and persistent, and does not include the ability to experience joy, which is still present throughout the grieving process.

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 

00:12:30
FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS 

00:12:35
JIM HARRIGAN Major depressive disorder involves experiencing a major depressive episode, which causes significant impairment for the individual's work and social life. These episodes last on average from six to nine months but can go for as long as years in some individuals. A major depressive episode can be quoted as a single episode or recurrent. A single episode means that only one episode occurs during the patient's lifetime. As always, it is important that the clinician rule out that the condition is not better explained by other disorders. The physiological affects of the substance or another medical condition. If a depressive disorder is induced by another medication, a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder maybe given. And if it is caused by a medical condition, the clinician can give the diagnosis of depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The clinician is also able to specify the presence of psychotic features, the state of remission, and severity, as mentioned previously.

00:13:45
SPECIFIERS 

00:13:50
JIM HARRIGAN There are numerous specifiers the clinician can add to the diagnosis. These will allow the clinician to include extra detail and information to the diagnosis, which can potentially help future clinicians in understanding the patient. For example, the specifier with anxious distress can indicate that the patient has experienced feelings of foreboding, agitation, or tension, intense worry leading to trouble concentrating, or the feeling that they may lose control of themselves during the majority of their most recent episode. In addition to with anxious distress, other potential specifiers include but are not limited to, with mixed features, with catatonia, with peripartum onset, and with seasonal pattern. 

00:14:45
PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 

00:14:45
(DYSTHYMIA) 

00:14:50
JIM HARRIGAN Persistent depressive disorder, also referred to as dysthymia, is characterized as a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. This occurs during the majority of days during this time period. While the possible symptomatology of persistent depressive disorder isn't quite as extensive as it is for major depressive disorder, patients with dysthymia can experience a range of severity. Many of the characteristics are similar to that of major depressive disorder, difficulty concentrating, problems with sleep, poor self-esteem, poor appetite, low energy, and feeling hopeless.

00:15:35
SPECIFIERS 

00:15:40
JIM HARRIGAN A patient with persistent depressive disorder may or may not have a major depressive episode for all or some of the period of symptoms. In addition to the specifiers available for major depressive disorder, allowing the clinician to indicate severity, the state of remission, and other features, there are also specifiers to signify the role of major depressive episodes in the disorder. A patient who for two years, has not experienced any major episodes can be said to have persistent depressive disorder with pure dysthymic syndrome. If, in the last two years, a patient has met the characteristics for a major depressive episode, then the specifier with persistent major depressive episode can be applied. If the patient is currently experiencing a major depressive episode, but has had periods of around two months, without qualifying for a full episode, the clinician should use the specifier with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode. And if they aren't currently experiencing a major depressive episode, but have had one or more in the last two years, the clinician should use with intermittent major depressive episodes, without current episode. The clinician can also indicate if the onset of dysthymia happened early onset or before the age of 21, or late onset if the symptoms happened later than age 21. 

00:17:15
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITY 

00:17:20
JIM HARRIGAN Some alternatives to consider with persistent depressive disorder are those along the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. There are depressive symptoms associated with psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and delusional disorder. So a diagnosis of dysthymia is not made if the depressive symptoms only coincide with the psychotic disorder. Persistent depressive disorder can also coexist with personality disorders, though care must be taken to determine whether the individual truly qualifies for two disorders. 

00:18:00
PREMENSTRUAL DYSPHORIC DISORDER 

00:18:05
JIM HARRIGAN Premenstrual dysphoric disorder affects up to 5 percent of menstruating women. It involves mood symptoms that occurs repeatedly during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, and alleviate shortly after menstruation commences. Characteristics include changes in mood or appetite, trouble concentrating or sleeping, feelings of being out of control or anxious, irritability, lethargy, depressed mood, and decreased interest in activities, as well as physical characteristics, such as bloating, weight changes, and breast sensitivity or other pain. These symptoms should cause the patient significant distress in their daily life and not be solely a heightening of the symptoms from another disorder.

DISRUPTIVE MOOD DYSREGULATION DISORDER

BRETT DUGGAN I want to. 

00:19:05
ABBEY GRACE Give me your phone. 

00:19:10
BRETT DUGGAN Mom, it's my phone. 

00:19:10
ABBEY GRACE I know it's your phone, but I bought it. 

00:19:10
BRETT DUGGAN No. 

00:19:15
JIM HARRIGAN Beginning before the child is ten years old and affecting adolescence between six and eighteen years of age, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is used to diagnose children with continuous extreme verbal and behavioral outbursts. These outbursts are incongruous when considering the circumstances and out of character for the individual's developmental level. And even when the individual isn't having a mood outburst, they are on edge or angry the majority of the time. The characteristics are present in multiple settings, such as at home, at school, or with peers. 

00:19:55
ABBEY GRACE So, I'm not bad in that. 

00:19:55
BRETT DUGGAN No, I want to. 

00:20:00
ABBEY GRACE I don't care that you don't want to… 

00:20:00
BRETT DUGGAN I don't want to. 

00:20:00
JIM HARRIGAN It is also important to distinguish these symptoms from other mental disorders. The symptoms should not meet the characteristics of a manic or hypomanic episode. And they should not occur exclusively during a major depressive episode. While it can co-exist with conditions, such as major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder, the diagnosis can not co-exist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and bipolar disorder. If the patient persists with characteristics of both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, only the diagnosis for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be given. Because these depressive mood symptoms can affect the very lens through which individuals view their lives. Those with these disorders can feel helpless, like they have no hope of ever feeling happy or whole again. While being diagnosed with a mental disorder can be upsetting to the patient, it can also offer a source of comfort for the individual. It can let them know that their mood isn't their fault, but is instead the product of a mental disorder, one that can be managed and even treated. Though diagnosing a mental disorder is only the first step in this treatment process, it can put the patient on the path to recovery, to help them live a more balanced happy life.
