Erickson Foundation Inc. 3606 North 24th Street Phoenix, Arizona, 85016-6500 www.ericksonfoundation.org www.ericksonfoundation.org/press www.evolutionofpsychotherapy.com The following program was recorded in Anaheim, California December 9th, 2005 Evolution of Psychotherapy 5th Conference Clinical Demonstration 

00:03:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the conference was filmed this particular session was filmed at the Evolution for Psychotherapy Conference. And this couple are were, were picked by, ah, a colleague who had not been-- neither had been in therapy neither knew very much at all about couples therapy or about Imago and they agreed to do this before about, uhm, back up now just a little bit. 

00:03:35
[sil.] 

00:03:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Have something that-- I, I think I'm gonna ask you to start this we can go into the other stuff a-- a-- as you start this way because it's, its established your safety. 

00:04:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So now the thing I'm gonna asked them to do, uhm, is something as every couple to do no matter how stress the relationship is. Start of your first transaction of within an appreciation. No matter-- no matter what and people say well and it really angry of pathological couple can't do that. And the answer of that is I haven't met one yet who couldn't, uhm, and wouldn't, ah, if you asked them right and so here's what I'm asking. 

00:04:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Would be willing to share with Steven start off by sharing something with him that is truly impressive to you about him that you appreciate. 

00:04:40
LINDA Uh-uh. 

00:04:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So that we can start with connectional piece - 

00:04:45
LINDA Sure. 

00:04:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX - to let him know what that is. 

00:04:45
LINDA Sure. Sure. 

00:04:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so there's a structure here which is Steven, uhm, can I have an appointment. In Imago you always make an appointment before you sent a message, ah, at least in the beginning stages when you're learning the process because you want the person to be available when you send a message. And sometimes I have to go the bathroom and they can't listen to you and so maybe they can in 5 minutes but not now. So would you say, "Can I have an appointment or you're available?" 

00:05:10
LINDA Can I have an appointment, are you available? 

00:05:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Now I'm get gonna do some infinite long here. second, piece show with appreciation. The other piece is that, uhm, a part of healthy relationship is civility. And I discovered most couples are just not civil. So George are walk in the room and say to Mary, "Oh, by the way Mary let me tell you about the elephant I saw outside pulling wagon down street, ah, or, ah, the car broke down and you know, I'm sorry I'm late. You're not listening Mary." And Mary says, "Oh, what you're talking?" "Yes." Well, that's an assumption that has what-- how old is that might a year, that when you walk into the room mommy has only one thing to do and that's the standard with the head of some empty cavity waiting for your body to show up with your words so that you can be held in her mind and soul. So we trained couples-- we trained couples to ask for appointments, to ask for permission to talk. And the reason for that is boundaries, boundaries, boundaries, boundaries. And when you cross a boundary you get war and all wars are about boundary violations. So you have to ask couples to learn how to regulate boundaries. And the second thing is that you want to grow, help them in their, ah, even civil interactions grow beyond the patterns of childhood adaption. So it have to say, "Are you available?" So I'm ask here now. 

00:06:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes, sir. And, and I have something positive I'd like to say to you. 

00:06:55
LINDA I have something positive I... 

00:06:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that's the second figures when you say, "Ah, can we talk?" Do you know how terrifying that is to men? You walk in the room and say, "Can we have a talk?" We know you're not asking to go to bed with us. We know that, it would never occur to us that there was any part of you interested in us you wanna talk. So you say, "And I'd like to talk about how wonderful you are or about need I have or frustration or about the strange thing I saw in this tree. There's was an elephant pulling a wagon with a dog in it." 

00:07:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX And the reason for that is we want your amygdala to relax right now, that's-- she's not gonna bring you a problem. Ah, in fact she's gonna bring you perhaps of blessing of some kind and that is safe and she's going to say something unless, unless wonderful things make you anxious this, uhm, sometimes that's the case but we want you to announce the topic so that he can be prepared to hold the experience that you're going to bring to him. Okay. 

00:08:00
LINDA Uhm. 

00:08:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the thing that I-- and I'm gonna give you a lot of structure and (inaudible ) and guide you through this and when you're cycle a bicycle and when you're paddling I'm gonna let you go. 

00:08:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so you noticed we also have the couples sitting in what we call the Imago position, that is always face to face and never side by side, never parallel this is a conversation. And the therapist is not going to talk very much to the individuals but facilitate their conversation with each other, ah, with what we call senate stem... 

00:08:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Though but as long as you're a balance I'm gonna be their holding that it's that, okay, with you. 

00:08:35
LINDA Yes. 

00:08:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. Uhm, so, uhm, Steven I have something I wanna share that in the new fill in the blank it's positive wonderful and appreciation and gratitude or something like that. The behavior that he has a trade he has an event that he participated in that made you feel care about in love just something like that. 

00:08:55
LINDA Ah, Steven I wanted to share with you, ah, something that I really appreciate about you and that I appreciate about how you are with me. Uhm, when you're present you really fully present with me and really available and that meant a lot to me. And the, the companionship and the, the feeling of love and connection and I feel when that happens is really special and important to me. 

00:09:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX You hear now she is speaking of the universal journey for connection that's what in my view every couple wants and she articulate. 

00:09:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, ah, your line is now let me see if I've got that. Ah, and then you mirror back thinking of that as a flat mirror rather con-- convex or concave, concave or convex. You want diminished it or collaborate it, you'll just flat the mirror so and so and its can be either word for word or it can be, uhm, a paraphrase but it's an accurate paraphrase of what you just said. So let me see if I've got. 

00:10:10
STEVEN Let me see if I've got that. You-- one of the things that you're happy with about me is when I'm fully present for you and participating, ah, in our conversations and makes you feel, ah, ah, cherish in love. 

00:10:30
LINDA Yes. 

00:10:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting you? 

00:10:30
STEVEN Am I getting you-- is that correct - 

00:10:35
LINDA Yes. 

00:10:35
STEVEN - do I-- did I miss anything? 

00:10:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, and she says, yes, and now would you say, "Well, is there more about that. 

00:10:40
STEVEN Is there more about that? 

00:10:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And you heard Ellyn and then talking this morning about curiosity. So one of the things Ellyn and I learn when we are in the valley of the shadow of despair fearing evil, ah, like a having to marry somebody else, uhm, was that we are decided that we would do two things, ah, one of them work and the other one barely that is we would go to zero negativity. And that is you just give up smoking today you give up negativity today. Ah, because we found that for about 3 months when we have much to say so each other. Ah, but the what we've been fill that empty silence with was, uhm, ah, of appreciations. And we found that of ameliorated somehow the emptiness but it didn't-- it didn't reconnect us and what really reconnected us. Here is something that was really, ah, exciting and totally, ah, shocking to me curiosity is very sexy. To be curious and if you think about it however, it makes total sense that curiosity means I'm experiencing you and I want to experience you experiencing yourself which is the process of becoming present. Now any couple how-- no matter how difficult they are, how narcissistic border line if we wanna be them up with those term. Any couple will respond in, ah, and I'm saying this with 40 years of sitting with couples will respond to this kind of structure in a similar way whether they, uhm, if, if you hold them in this. 

00:12:25
LINDA Uhm, yes. 

00:12:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX If there more about that. 

00:12:25
LINDA Ah, I especially appreciate that you fulfill most of the things that I need a farmer-- a partner that the most important things to made the intimacy in the conversation in a love are all, all there. 

00:12:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I got that. 

00:12:45
STEVEN Let me see if I got that. You, you really appreciate the fact that I and most of the things that you need the intimacy, the love and the sharing are there and those are the important things and you have them in our relationship. 

00:13:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting you. 

00:13:05
STEVEN Am, am I getting it right. 

00:13:05
LINDA Ah, yeah, there's one thing that, that I didn't say. 

00:13:15
STEVEN What is it? 

00:13:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so would you clarify. 

00:13:15
STEVEN Would you? 

00:13:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And imagine there is something I didn't get. Now would you clarify. 

00:13:20
STEVEN Would you clarify? 

00:13:25
LINDA Ah, yeah, I think I didn't say sharing because, uhm, I'm still staying at the positive. 

00:13:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes, stay with the positive for, for now. 

00:13:40
LINDA I don't say sharing I said companionship. 

00:13:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Companionship. 

00:13:45
LINDA And, uhm... 

00:13:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so let me see... 

00:13:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So it's important to mirror accurately. 

00:13:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX If I got that. 

00:13:50
STEVEN Okay, so let me see if I got that, uhm, you didn't say sharing you said companionship - 

00:13:55
LINDA Yes. 

00:14:00
STEVEN - which are and so because what you just said, yeah. 

00:14:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, so let me try again to see if I got that right now and so send it all back to her. 

00:14:10
STEVEN So let me see if I got that right. Uhm, you said that you are specially happy with the components of out relationship that have to do with companionship and love and presence and that my presence and the attention when were, ah, having a conversations meets those needs. 

00:14:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting it now? 

00:14:35
STEVEN Am I getting it now? 

00:14:40
LINDA Yes. 

00:14:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

00:14:45
STEVEN Is there more about that? 

00:14:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX The hand on our, on our heart, you know. 

00:14:45
LINDA No. 

00:14:45
STEVEN Is there more about that? 

00:14:50
LINDA No. 

00:14:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so well let me see if I'm got it off and now take the two or three things she said and summarized within two succinct summary maybe one or two sentences. So let me see if I got... 

00:15:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Now the summary is important because most of us remember the past thing we heard and so the things this morning I think that Pete-- didn't say this but the reason I remember the As of spade is because, ah, it was the last thing up, up there and, ah, when you put it back up anyway and then didn't come back and so you remember the last you're-- or sometimes the first thing you heard but not much in between. So in order to have a full presence to the partner is important that their being a condense summary which they'll do. 

00:15:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Had all that. 

00:15:30
STEVEN Let me see if I have all that. You're basically happy with the parts of our relationship that have to do with the presence that I bring to our conversations and that you the needs for love and companionship, ah, and, and being present, ah, you value in our relationship to have that right or is there more. 

00:16:05
LINDA Yes. 

00:16:05
STEVEN Yeah. Okay. 

00:16:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So I got it all. 

00:16:05
STEVEN I got it all. 

00:16:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so now, uhm, we want to set up like we set up a connectional transaction and so you now ask, and I gonna share with you I really wanna stay connected with you and gonna share with a frustration. 

00:16:20
LINDA I really wanna stay connected with you and I wanted to know if I could share a frustration. 

00:16:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Are you available for that? 

00:16:30
LINDA Are you available for that? 

00:16:35
STEVEN I think I am. 

00:16:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Think I am. 

00:16:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. so, uhm, one way to become available is to take a deep breath just kind of relax and let yourself breath oxygen to the brain helps relax the brain. And, uhm, be aware that you're-- may listen to some her in pain of that-- or your partner is experiencing with you. And one thing that I want to, uhm, just begin saying is that most of the transactions of pain between, ah, as to the partners is often, ah, 80% in the past and 20% in the present. So it's not like we created but we certainly, ah, touch our injured the, the sensitive place that somehow comes from our childhood. And, uhm, so there's a pain you can see with the tears, ah, right now and so would you be willing to, ah, stay with those tears and let the tears speak the pain and my frustration is its help-- helpful for him to have a behavior - 

00:17:50
LINDA Okay. 

00:17:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX - rather than a trait or something general that couldn't find but a behavior he can find. So I have a frustration when you do act-- or when you did acts stay, stay with us. 

00:18:05
LINDA Okay. Uhm, I have... 

00:18:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So it's always important to have a person share a behavior that frustrates me rather than a trait that frustrates me. Because the behavior you can address, the trait you can't address. 

00:18:20
LINDA Frustration, uhm, it starts with the behavior and generally the behavior is there's a commitment that I feel you've made such as being somewhere at a certain time or just being somewhere or doing something. And then when you don't do that and you're not there or you're late or whatever it is and I express my frustration and, and unhappiness that you haven't gone wherever it is or done whatever it is you immediately make excuses for why it is. 

00:19:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX And let me just butt in. So then what I hear are excuses (inaudible ). 

00:19:16
LINDA So what I hear are excuses and reasons and what I want - 

00:19:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And, and stay with, with that and when that happens - 

00:19:25
LINDA And when that happens - 

00:19:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX - it happens it reminds me and check back to the mind. 

00:19:30
LINDA Ah, it reminds me of times - 

00:19:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX When I was little. 

00:19:35
LINDA when I was little and I wasn't allowed to have my feelings, I wasn't allowed to express any negative feelings because whatever I could feel was nothing compare to what my mother was going through or what my father that they had reasons for everything and I wasn't allowed to ever be unhappy or disappointed or, or sad that I didn't have a right to those feelings. 

00:20:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I'm getting that? Okay. 

00:20:10
STEVEN Let me see if I'm getting that. 

00:20:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So if this gonna hold the feelings unless and be sure it's on board. Summarized that. 

00:20:15
STEVEN Let me see if I'm getting that, ah, I have some behaviors that are obviously begin behaviors where I make a commitment to be somewhere on time but a certain time or a certain place and then I made her wait or I'm not there when you expect me to be there. And then when you explain your frustration instead of this need to it I react by depending it and getting giving you reasons why this happened and that makes you go back to when you were young - 

00:21:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX That reminds you of. 

00:21:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX - reminds you when you were a little girl and you, ah, couldn't get your needs met and, ah, when no man would listen to you because their needs where all more important than your needs today that - 

00:21:10
LINDA Yeah. 

00:21:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Can I get-- can I get all that? 

00:21:15
STEVEN Can I get all that? 

00:21:15
LINDA Yes. 

00:21:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And is there more about and that means about that the childhood experience, okay, is there more about that. 

00:21:25
STEVEN Is there more about that... 

00:21:25
LINDA Yeah. 

00:21:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so say it all. 

00:21:30
LINDA Ah, because of that it's very hard for me to asked for my needs to get mad at all. And to-- and when I feel that my needs are not, ah, or when I feel that I do express a feeling and then my reality of what is happen when you respond by saying by getting angry and telling me that I have no rights to those feelings it reminds me of everything that my mother always said that I had no right to my feelings. 

00:22:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX So I want you to continue expressing that and I'm gonna shift just a little and I'm going to ask Steven if he would at the moment take on the as if role of your mother. And if you will be the little who felt invisible to her and continue to talk to the answer of mother although Steven will, ah, personify this is that okay with you? 

00:22:45
LINDA Yeah. 

00:22:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX okay, would you be willing to do that. 

00:22:50
STEVEN Yes. 

00:22:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Or to just kind of remove your consciousness from Steven and now you're becoming, uhm, mom. Did you call her mom or mother or? 

00:23:00
LINDA Mommy. 

00:23:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Mommy and you gonna become mommy and you're going to be how old? 

00:23:10
LINDA Eight. 

00:23:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Eight, 8 years old. So mommy were sitting with your 8 year old daughter and she's in pain, she's in a lot of pain and would you be willing to listen to her to tell you about her pain? 

00:23:25
STEVEN As she-- as her mother actually would do it because I know her mother. 

00:23:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah, no I want you just to-- I want you to do it that way I'm gonna instruct you to do it. 

00:23:35
STEVEN Okay. 

00:23:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. So I'm gonna ask you to be the mother that she didn't have and to listen to this painful experience, okay. So you're gonna be the mom, you're gonna mommy but you gonna be the mommy that she needs. Is that okay with you? Okay. So here's mom and I'm gonna ask mom to listen and would you tell her what is it like living with you? 

00:24:05
LINDA That I should ask her - 

00:24:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Tell her and, and then I'm gonna ask her to ask you. Would you say, what is it like living with me and what did she call you? 

00:24:15
LINDA Linda. 

00:24:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, Linda what is it like living with me? 

00:24:20
STEVEN Linda what is it like living with me. 

00:24:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Living with you-- yes. 

00:24:25
LINDA Everything is about you. everything is about how sad you are or how hard your life is or about what you need or what you want. And pour you and nothing is about me. 

00:24:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so this time just a little mirroring mom. So mirror that bag briefly. So everything is about me. 

00:24:55
STEVEN So everything is about me and what I want and what I need and what I'm doing and - 

00:25:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Nothing is about you. 

00:25:05
STEVEN - nothing is about you. 

00:25:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting you? 

00:25:05
STEVEN Am I, I may get in what you're saying? 

00:25:10
LINDA Yes. 

00:25:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So tell me all about that is there more? 

00:25:15
STEVEN Tell me all about that is there more? 

00:25:20
LINDA Yeah. I, I'm not allowed to have any feelings especially if they're not positive about you and telling you how wonderful you are and if I-- I'm disappointed it's something even if I'm angry with someone else you just take it as being about you. And I can't have that friend anymore or I can't have that you know, as if I'm-- as if I'm only there to be a part extension of view. 

00:25:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And when that happens I feel. 

00:25:55
LINDA When that happens I feel invisible I feel like - 

00:26:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Feel invisible, you're really invisible. 

00:26:00
LINDA - I can't be me or that I'm not that I can't be a person. 

00:26:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah. And invisible feels like. 

00:26:10
LINDA Invisible feels like I'm not existed and not important. 

00:26:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Not existed and not important. So mirror that back. 

00:26:20
STEVEN So what you're saying is that, ah, when you're with me you feel like you're just that-- you want that I want you to just be an extension of me no matter what the conversation is about your friends or anything you turned-- I turned it around and making about me or whoever I want and then it makes you feel, ah, invisible and, ah, makes you feel like you're not important. 

00:26:50
LINDA Yeah. 

00:26:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So what's the worst part of all of that for you? What's the most painful piece. 

00:27:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well I just noticed one of the processes here is that you facilitate moving to feelings and back into heart. 

00:27:05
STEVEN Am I-- am I getting that? 

00:27:10
LINDA Yeah, although I can't express positive if I tell you how wonderful you are how much I love you or I appreciate I just can't express any feelings that are not positive. 

00:27:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. 

00:27:25
STEVEN So you can't express positive feelings about the situation but you can't express any negative feelings about things. 

00:27:35
LINDA Right. 

00:27:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting you now. 

00:27:35
STEVEN Am I getting you now? 

00:27:35
LINDA Yes. 

00:27:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, uhm, Linda as, uhm, as your mom, uhm, what, what do you need for me the most that would heal all that as your mom? 

00:27:55
STEVEN Linda as your mom what do you need for me the most that would heal you? 

00:28:05
LINDA I need you to listen to my feelings without reacting to them. And to say you're sorry if you've done something to hurt me. 

00:28:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So what you need the most for me. 

00:28:20
STEVEN What you need the most for me is to listen to my feelings and - 

00:28:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Listen to your feelings. 

00:28:25
STEVEN - listen to your feelings, uhm, to listen to your feelings and to simply say I'm sorry. 

00:28:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting that. 

00:28:40
STEVEN Am I getting that?

And in this place here, ah, with Steven and me and all this people just for a moment or just us not all this people. Are you, okay? Are you back? 

00:31:50
LINDA Yes. 

00:31:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX How old are you? You don't have to answer that. 

00:31:50
LINDA I have to say. 

00:31:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Just make up adult age. 

00:31:55

00:31:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Somewhere over 20s. Somewhere over 20s. 

00:32:00
LINDA Yes, well over 20. 

00:32:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well over 20. And would you let mom go and let her face and let her memories go away and you'll be come back to Steven. 

00:32:10
STEVEN Yes. 

00:32:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. So as, ah, of Steven would you say to Linda, "Okay, oh, I get that of that, uhm, that, uhm, and, uhm, sort of summarized as hard as this is gonna be a sort of summarized all that you heard about the frustration with you, the pain in childhood and what she wants. And then I'm gonna ask you to validate that. Can you-- can you do that? So let me see if I got it all Linda? 

00:32:50
STEVEN Let me see if i got it all Linda. Your, your mother was not there for you and she everything that went on in her life and your relationship with her eyes was turned around so that it was eyes about her and even things in your own life would turn around to be about her and it made you feel invisible and totally unimportant and that, ah, it cause great pain that you felt like you could express your needs for anything or your feelings about and negative feelings about anything only positive feelings but nothing negative. Do I have that right? 

00:33:45
LINDA Yes. 

00:33:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So well-- you know, I can see the sense in that if when I, uhm, of come back to you with my you know what your frustrations was if when I do that then it given your childhood and touches that it make sense to me that you would be frustrated about that. Can you validate her frustration? 

00:34:05
STEVEN I can see the sense of that what you're saying and that when I don't acknowledge your feelings it brings you back to your early childhood when you weren't listen to anyway. And it take you back to a place where you feel invisible. 

00:34:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Then I can imagine that's very painful for being that emphatic piece. 

00:34:30
STEVEN And I can imagine that it makes-- it that it is very painful for you. 

00:34:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is that the feeling. 

00:34:40
STEVEN Is that the feeling? 

00:34:40
LINDA Yes. 

00:34:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Can you sort of know when he's got you when you feel some physiological miserable shift relax, deep breath check out really him seen. 

00:34:55
LINDA Yeah, I think he understands. 

00:35:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX I think you got it, okay. I felt it somewhere in your body - 

00:35:00
LINDA Yeah. 

00:35:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX - some release. What can you do? 

00:35:05
LINDA I'm not crying now. 

00:35:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And not crying now. Some release in your shoulders a little so then relax alright. Okay. So, ah, given all that, uhm, would you, ah, say to her so what was your partner-- what do you need from me? What specific behavior do you need from me? Would you give me three choices things that I could do which one I do them will protect you from that pain and heal that pain. 

00:35:40
STEVEN So... 

00:35:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Are, are you willing to that? To, to move that? 

00:35:40
STEVEN Yes, I am. 

00:35:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. 

00:35:40
STEVEN Uhm, as your partner what can I do specifically to help you when the situation are rises to alleviate your pain. Give me three-- give me three, ah, specific things that, that I can do that would specifically help you to heal and not have this pain in the situation. 

00:36:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So I'm gonna invite you now to think about this, this is there's an invitation which I'm facilitating and his agreeing to. And I wanna invite you to think a behaviors something you could do that you could take a picture off and you can measure it and it's positive and it's repeatable. Ad it can happen over and over again because this happen over and over again in childhood. So we need something new to happen over and over again that is the polarity to that in your relationship. So this to be behavior and he ask you to do three because I wanna be sure he succeeds because I can tell in then experiencing Steven that he wants he didn't want you to happen this pain he wants to you available and done quite know what to do. It's not of us too. So what, what you give me something so he can succeed. So he give him three choices and I'm gonna ask him to pick only one of those things. So your three have to be focused, this is three ways to skin a cat. Uhm, and you're gonna tell him three ways that he could touch that pain in you from childhood and when it reactivated in your relationship. Are you willing to do that? Okay. 

00:37:20
LINDA Yes. 

00:37:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So think of a behavior. 

00:37:30
LINDA Oh, I think the behavior would be, ah, would he hasn't fulfill the commitment. 

00:37:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. So alright, when he hasn't fulfill the commitment. So, ah, when you, when you make a promise and that's about being on time sounds like. 

00:37:50
LINDA There's, yeah, basically you're doing something. 

00:37:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Or doing or, or finish of doing attached - 

00:37:50
LINDA Or being somewhere. 

00:37:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX - being somewhere-- being, being somewhere doing something, okay, so that general thing. When that happens there something you want you want him to do. Could you specify what that is? 

00:38:05
LINDA Ah, yeah, I would like him to - 

00:38:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX I would like you to help him. 

00:38:10
LINDA - I would like you to acknowledge that you didn't do what you said what you were going to do. And to say you're sorry. 

00:38:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. So now I wanna edit it a little so would you say, "Ah, we want things do not be forever always and never, uhm, but, ah, time limited time bound specific. So would you be willing to say something like for the next 2 months, uhm, when you do not do something that you said you would do or show up what you said you're gonna be you, you don't follow through on a promised that I kind of view that, that's a is a promise failure am I getting that right? 

00:38:50
LINDA Yeah. 

00:38:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX That really is what hurts. This is an expectation of reliability and then there's a promise failure and that's what really hurt. And then when you put test about it in childhood the unavailability of your pick care takers you couldn't protest - 

00:39:10
LINDA Right. 

00:39:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX - because they were never wrong. 

00:39:10
LINDA Right. 

00:39:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Getting that right. 

00:39:10
LINDA Yeah. 

00:39:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So you wanna behavior now that is helped him to establish being reliably present for you? But we wanna practice it for awhile not make it forever because you might want something different in 4 weeks, ah, it might get clearer what you need in 4 weeks. So would you-- would you say well nex-- for the next, uhm, 3 weeks, 2 months you cannot pick the time when, when you don't-- when, when you don't what you promise to do I want you to then say that, uhm, I didn't do it and I'm sorry and support, okay. And you maybe you want him to look you in the eye, ah, when he sees that. You want him to, ah, touch your body in some way just think about all the ways this can be, ah, a very healing transaction for you of, of, uhm, snuggle my nose, of hold, hold my butt or the what, what would-- what would be visually, cognitively and emotionally touching for you? 

00:40:15
LINDA Okay. 

00:40:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is this your time to create, your time to, to repair in, in the childhood and create the future. Okay. 

00:40:25
LINDA Okay. 

00:40:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So now put a time limit on it and a frequency on it and support. Okay. 

00:40:30
LINDA Okay. Uhm, for the next month - 

00:40:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Next month, okay. 

00:40:35
LINDA -ah, when you don't - 

00:40:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX One, one time each day or just whenever? 

00:40:40
LINDA Ah. 

00:40:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Whenever. 

00:40:40
LINDA Whenever. 

00:40:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, whenever. 

00:40:45
LINDA Whenever you, ah, don't follow through on something you said you were going to do. 

00:40:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And I-- and you is gonna have to know and I bring it to your attention. 

00:40:55
LINDA And I'll bring it to your attention. 

00:40:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. 

00:40:55
LINDA I would like you to acknowledge that you didn't do it, say you're sorry and hug me. 

00:41:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. So that's behavior number one. 

00:41:10
LINDA Can I say what not to do. 

00:41:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX No. 

00:41:10
LINDA Okay. 

00:41:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX We want to construct possibilities rather than limitations, okay. 

00:41:15
LINDA Okay. 

00:41:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So that's number one would you mirror that back? 

00:41:20
STEVEN So what you're say like that is that whenever I do not keep my commitment or show up late that at first I acknowledge that I didn't keep my commitment and then you want me to say that I am sorry and then you want me to hug you. 

00:41:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get that. 

00:41:45
STEVEN Did I get that? 

00:41:45
LINDA Yes. 

00:41:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So what's your second request? 

00:41:45
STEVEN What's your second request? 

00:41:50
LINDA Ah, my second request does it-- it has needs to be, ah, different response to the same issue. 

00:41:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX The same character screening, yeah. 

00:42:00
LINDA Okay, ah, when you don't for the next 2 months or what I say 1 month, for the next month - 

00:42:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Next month. Okay. 

00:42:10
LINDA - whenever you - 

00:42:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX You can have two if you want it. 

00:42:10
LINDA We can have two, okay, 2 months - 

00:42:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Two months, this time, alright. 

00:42:15
LINDA - on the 2 months when you don't keep the commitment, ah, I would like you to, ah, offer to make it up to me in some way. 

00:42:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And one of the thoughts I have about that is? 

00:42:30
LINDA And one of the thoughts I have about how you can you make it up to me is by offering, ah, to do something to help me out. And then you would still hug me. 

00:42:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so hug you, okay. So let me see if I get that one. 

00:42:50
STEVEN Let me see if I got that one. So... 

00:42:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX I'm aware that we are over time and its about 7 more minutes of this I will keep running and if you wanna keep seeing it but if you wanna go to lunch, ah, you can activate my abandonment with-- that's just a joke. 

00:43:10
STEVEN In the next 2 months whenever I don't keep my commitment I'm not sure I have that one... 

00:43:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX So would you say that again. 

00:43:20
STEVEN So would say that again. 

00:43:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. 

00:43:25
LINDA Ah, for the next 2 months whenever you don't keep a commitment, ah, you will offer to make it up to me by doing something for me and hug me. 

00:43:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX And, and let me just keep clear something you will ask for. 

00:43:40
LINDA Something I will ask for. 

00:43:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Or you'll ask for at the time. 

00:43:45
LINDA I will ask for that. 

00:43:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And you won't have to come up with it and by himself will now you asking... 

00:43:45
LINDA No, he just has to offer to do something for me. 

00:43:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah, as to offer to do something. 

00:43:50
LINDA And ask me what I would like him to do. 

00:43:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And you may or may not ask him you really do. 

00:43:55
LINDA And I may not ask him to do it. 

00:43:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX But you want him to offer. 

00:43:55
LINDA To offer. 

00:44:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. 

00:44:00
STEVEN So let me see if I understand that. So... 

00:44:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So I think actually what I'm going to do to honor time boundaries which boundaries are important is just tell you briefly what else happens of and his, ah, very engaging fellow. But she asked for three things, ah, behaviors, ah, he has to pick one and what he does is mirror all that bag then picks one tells her what, uhm, he will do and how he commits to that. She mirrors back what he will do and then, ah, he says that's right that's what I'll do. They-- then close that off and they hug each other and they go on now. This couple neither this couple neither this person has ever been in therapy, ah, one of them had in fact been an hour and a half of seminar on Imago as a participants so that sort of new she'd a little bit about but the stuff was about. He had no idea about therapy what was going on and for some got off for reason showed up in front of 2000 people to demonstrate our relationship with his partner. 

00:45:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX I forgot as I've look that it recently but I think it was the first one that he would, ah, he would do that. So, ah, and I'm sorry to run overtime I thank you for being here we need to go our lunch appreciate your attendance very much. 

00:45:20
Esther Perel, MA, LMFT 

00:45:20
ESTHER PEREL Uhm, how many of you were with me this morning? Woooh, uhm, how many of you are just here this afternoon? How can it be the same amount. this is like the awareness thing of this morning, you know, it looks the same. Uhm, and how many of you are new to me? Wow, okay. So, uhm, but it may be the same one that I new to me when new this morning. Yes? Okay. Ah, much better I hear myself. Uhm, so welcome, uhm, everyone I'm a Esther Perel and, uhm, I will, uhm, take you on a little, ah, exploratory trip of the erotic mind. Uhm, I'm very sorry that Jack Morin is not joining us, uhm, I was really hoping he would be with us today cuz he's been a major influence in my thinking so if you don't know that book it's called The Erotic Mind, uhm, you put it up there. Uhm, I am the author of Mating and Captivity, ero--- reconciling the erotic into domestic or unlocking erotic intelligence as you want. And it is in the process of writing about, uhm, desire and trying to come with a theory of desire that I also began to, uhm, study fantasy or study the erotic mind or become curious about our erotic imagination. And the reason or the way I can to thinking about that aspect of sexuality and of couples life, uhm, is that. When you begin to look the difference between sex and eroticism one way would be to say that animals have sex and we are the only ones who have an erotic life. Which means that we are the only that can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms and touch nobody just because we can imagine it. We have the power of anticipation, we have-- which is the mortar of the erotic imagination. Uhm, we have the ability to put ourselves in a situation without having to be in the situation. So that eroticism which is the cultivation of pleasure for its own sake has its primal agent, the imagination. It is the main motor of the erotic act, is now our imagination. Uhm, it's with our imagination that we come up with rituals, with ceremonies, with celebrations, with abilities to create alternate realities. 

00:48:30
[sil.] 

00:48:40
ESTHER PEREL I'm back, yeah, I needed to let you know the handouts for this morning are up but the ends out-- the handout for this afternoon will be up later. So a lot of what I'll be talking to you about will be summarized in major points. You will also get an article that I just wrote recently, ah, that's called Erotic Fantasy Reconsidered from triumph to tragedy. And you will get, uhm, a bibliography and a list of, ah, movies and all of that. So, uhm, it's, uhm, its beyond my control but it is been taking care of by my control. With my control. Uhm, so what I would like to suggest is how we can go together in this very short amount of time and prove the debts and the riches of our erotic imagination. And particularly what are imagination is and what it can do for us that would be the lens to which I want us to look at fantasy. You know, most people talk very little about sexuality and then rarely talk about sexuality with the person that their usually I meant to have sex with. Uhm, and if they talk little about what they do-- they talk even less about what their thinking about while their doing it. But as a whole I would like to say that sex isn't something we do, sex is a place we go. And it's a place we go inside ourselves and with another or with others. So where does it take us and where do we take ourselves through sexuality. Where do-- where-- which part of ourselves are we connecting too? What part of us are we expressing? What kinds of experiences are we having? With ourselves and with another or plural. But you know, in our erotic mind even our solitary pleasures are always plural there is always someone else involve even if it's another version of ourselves. So by definition the erotic imagination takes place in the plural. Uhm, now, when I began to look at this whole subject then when I began to kind of look back if you want at, uhm, uhm, at my own education about fantasy, ah, pretty much what I was told is that fantasy is the bread of the impoverished. It's for the people who can't get the real stuff. How many of you got that idea at some point in your education. Oh, you're very lucky. You know, for me fantasy was often for, uhm, the neurotic, the immature, the ones who won't grow up, uhm, the ones who have afraid of intimacy, the ones who needs to go elsewhere. I mean I actually spend many years not knowing too much positive about it. And suddenly not how it could be used in Couples Therapy and suddenly not how it could be link with erotic intimacy in a couple. So it those connections. Uhm, by the way another thing that I know-- sorry for other interruption but I also was to tell you that this, ah, sheet going around for the mailing list but that those of you who are ready put your name in the morning forget about it. And those of you who want to stay in touch even do I don't harass you, uhm, you are welcome too. It will allowed me to send a few other things about the workshop as well. Uhm, so I look at fantasy, uhm, as a valuable creative resource first and foremost. Uhm, and in that sense it's a resource that helps us transcend reality and it freeze us from the hatches of reality. But I put it in a positive spin rather than seeing it as not wanting to be there I see it as being there or being in certain moments of reality it sometimes really painful. With a fantasy I can remember my youth and with the fantasy I can remember your youth and with the fantasy I can remember the breast that have been confiscated. And with the fantasy I can remember myself when my libido was different it allows me to transcend the limits of what reality imposes on us and to open it up. And we have that gift that allows us to flee reality to create another one. It isn't always the negative I'm saying it because so much of fantasies been getting a bad wrapped about that. Especially in the context of an intimate relationship. Uhm, I look at fantasy as an expression of our personal freedom, uhm, mainly in the sense you can force people to have sex you can never force to want it. And in that sense it is intrinsically link to the concept of desire. You can go off in your head anywhere you want. Uhm, and in that it becomes the probably one of the most intense expressions. It will allows the prisoner to survive. It will allow us sometimes to expand beyond the prisons that some of times we live in our own doing not just the one impose on us. And they are, uhm, maps of psychological and cultural preoccupations meaning that understanding what a fantasy will do for us will help you better understand the emotional and the sexual needs that people bring to their sexual encounters. A good fantasies states the problem and offers the solution, says Michael Bader. So if you really understand the fantasy you are open often getting other persons truth at a level of bareness that you can hardly can get that in any other way. Because in our fantasies we will pour our deepest wishes our more persistent needs, our quest from our omnipotence, our fears of desertion everything. Our deepest psychology will be metaphorically transpose into our fantasies but with an outcome that is always bound to give us pleasure. Nobody suffers in a fantasy. Even if the plot is one that inflicts suffering the girl is always pleasure. Do you understand if you don't make the connection immediately you just look at little kids who play. And in general we tend to play with something that isn't part of our condition. Meaning if you are in jail you rarely wanna play prisoner. Do you understand? In order to play with something you must have just enough distance that allows you to take back the original plot and turn it into a source of excitation and pleasure by virtue of your being the director, the author and the protagonist all at once. You create all pieces like in a dream it's a psychic structure and like in a dream working with fantasy is about decoding that symbolic structure. What Morin talks about that to me was very helpful in actually beginning to pay attention to fantasy and to do Couples Therapy by working through people's fantasies. Sometimes although that's just one window but it's the one I hear to introduced to you today is that through our fantasies we can repair, we can renew, we can undo and we can transform as well as we can avenge and we can compensate even if just for a moment. The inhibitions, the fears, the hopes, the aspirations, the yearnings that roil within us all of that. So it's not the cause and effect, it's not really you know, I feel invisible in life so I create a fantasy were I me resistible. But there is a correlation sometimes that we don't just find any kind of fantasy we tend to find fantasies that give us just the thing that we can't do our real life. And the thing about fantasy that I also often was told is that people want to experience in real life, you know, that which they will like in their fantasy but in fact it's often not the case. So much of us will get off at night on the very same things that we will go demonstrate against during the day. The Erotic Mind is really not politically correct it's a bit of a low less you know, a landscape up there sometimes. You know, with cheese white create guilt and so much shame how is it possible that I would like these-- this doesn't resemble me. This isn't like who I am in real life you know, but that is the reason why we have that space that with me or may not in act but it is that's space where we can actually go often to explore parts of us that we don't know go to explore in broad daylight. Or that we will transcend the limitation of our religious, of our beliefs, of our conscience, of our political views, of our personal limits it is a place where we go outside of ourselves in order to experience deep parts of ourselves. You're all super quite, you wake me. It's after lunch I hope you will had express so it's a hardest time. You know, uhm, but in fantasy we can often go any gate the limits that have been put upon us by our conscience and by ourselves image and by the social forces that domesticate our sexuality. In one of the cases that I was working with, uhm, the woman is, uhm, basically from the day she move in with her boyfriend she's no longer interested in him sexually. So for a while they think you know, she's an immigrant maybe it has to do with, uhm, the green card it maybe it ahs to do with not liking New York maybe it has to do with the precious of finding a job etcetera, etcetera. But then I find out that there is one time or one kind of time when she's actually super interested. After a fight in the back of a taxi, on the banquet in the restaurant you know, in public places in places where basically it is really clear that she's not doing what she supposed to do. She grew up in a very Catholic family in Europe in Spain. She, uhm, basically learn that sex was for babies and it's a woman's job to maintain my little satisfaction for the husband primarily. Uhm, and she wants sex that is for joy and for pleasure and from the moment she moves in with him it stop being an expression of her personal freedom and choice but it becomes that which is mandated to do by history and society and culture that women do. And she no longer wants to do it. And he doesn't understand what goes on because he it really would love it if they could sit on the couch watch the game turn to each other and get started. And without much of the production and he-- he'd so then you get so now you begin to prove what is about the transgression that allows her to actually rekindle her desire. What is it about not doing what you want. And what-- it happens that for her places like that are clearly not places where you are being complaint and obedient. And therefore, by definition you always know more that you're doing what you want when you're doing what you're supposed to do. Breaking the rules is super important in the tran-- in the construction of the desire. Because if desire is an expression of autonomy for certain people autonomy requires breaking rules not doing that which is expected. Okay. So we translate so that it becomes clear to him you know, it's not about the matter of liking production it's that her erotic mind found a way to circumvent the pitfalls of intimacy for her and create a space in which she could actually continue to want. And frankly as in old cases if these people had a good fit and if he happened to be into the same fantasy with her that never be in my office that be in the taxi. You know, it's a the some of these only becomes problematic because it there is not necessarily an understanding or a compatibility between the two people or at least of at first a perceive one. But then what also becomes clear is that the question I asked her is if the forbidden is sinful, if pleasure is sinful if pleasure is forbidden. How does the forbidden then become a source of pleasure? Now Catholicism has understood that from time in memoriam. Okay. It understood that the transgressive is about a subversive way that you take something which you should not supposed to do and then you turn it into the very thing that gives you the most amount of joy and pleasure. And I hope I get to show that, uhm, will clip afterwards I was actually thinking that one but it's, ah, it's an interesting one. Uhm, or if I'm working with these men I so actually you know also this week. So what happens in his fantasies that for him is about a woman that is completely at his beckon call is that in his life he ends of feeling that he can receive anything without having really sweat it for it and then he needs to justify that it is maybe the commensurate reward for the commensurate efforts. And so he has a whole world up there in which not only does she do everything that he wants but he doesn't have to pay for it in guilt, in debts in emotional debts. The mechanism becomes all the time, what is the problem that your fantasy is solving for you in such a beautifully imaginative metaphoric way. Now in general I would say it's-- sometimes very attempting for us to think that erotic fantasy is about plots and costumes and roles and characters and, and accoutrements and stuff. Erotic imagination, erotic fantasy is anything that heightens our erotic pleasure. The time of the day, the light of the sky, the temperature of the water, anything. It doesn't really have to be a set thing and that's very important because when people come in and they say I don't fantasized it's often because they think that they don't have a whole theater up there. And, uhm, basically when you know, you begin to talk to them what turns you on? What gets you interested? What are some of your thoughts? What are some of the images? What are some of the things that you respond to as a way to make them connect to their own desire to their own erotic self you begin to see that people have a lot of things that, ah, part of the whelm of the imagination but they don't think of it as such because that's not what is usually put in the category erotic imagination. Our thinking of this other guy I collected them this week I thought I'm just going to see of all my session you know, what the people actually talk about. Uhm, so I'm thinking of this men who, uhm, I'm keep asking him what it about leather and what is it about prostitutes? Real or imagine. In most of his life it's actually imagine. But it is about the person that you don't have to pleasure first. In my real relationship, in my relationship with my wife which is with for many, many years, uhm, the senses always been that one way to stay off the predatory fears is to make sure that she comes. But now the, the problem is that she no longer comes in the same way as she used to or nearly as often as she used to. So if I don't give first I can't take because one way I don't feel so bad about taking is because I have paid off my debt. With the prostitute you never have to worry about that. You can't just take veraciously, greedily and if you even go for real and you pay her you really paid of your debt in advance actually. So it clears him of all the burns of emotionality but more importantly it clears him of a lot of his predatory fears which I think is one of the, the central themes in a lot of, uhm, men fantasy actually. Uhm, in other guy who is into gang bang busters. You know, gang bang busters, it's many men one woman and, uhm, the reason we're talking about it with his partner and I hope will have I, I some sense to what some of these clips. But, uhm, basically, uhm, her sense is that it's all these men who have power over a woman. But if you really enter the erotic mind of someone who is into many men one woman the whole fantasy is about an invulnerable woman who can take on so many men her fragility is completely none existent and therefore he doesn't have to worry about hurting her. The power is all with her. In the fantasy of the man. But you got go linear at it, you can't just look at the external and think it's all about what's invisible meaning that the performance it doesn't necessarily match the meaning of the performance. So the session is about him telling her and why is it telling her because his living all this tapes on the floor. It's not been hidden it's been there with him before he ever met her, uhm, and, uhm, it's basically gang bang buster one, gang bang buster two, three, five, seven, 56 (inaudible ). It's all the same, you know. Uhm, but it's all the same with the different twist for him but the same is in the theme you know, sa-- I am the son of a woman that was a divorce mother of which I was the care taking son of which I always was a tuned to every mood of hers. I track her, I knew when I came in the house how she was doing. I have been all them there and the separately you know, in this other space there created a place where there is this other woman basically the other woman who, uhm, can take on as many as there are all at once into her orifices and be filled up by eight and not break. And that sense of invulnerability becomes a, a condition for him to be able to let go. Because and that's the problem as with his wife. His wife is too (inaudible ) and therefore has fragility that's why you don't marry that woman because the woman the moment you get to know her you always get to know the fragility of people. So the fantasy can never last. That's why this explain it to her at least for him. But the fragility of his wife makes it so that it becomes harder and harder for him to be able to let go with her and his gonna have to create another template in addition to the one he has. Most of the fantasies that are clearly etch that a real preferences that have existed in us for a long time you don't make them disappear. No reparative therapist going to make them go away. But you can expand the repertoire and add other template, other arouse of the templates. Especially when they become more fixed or fetishes which is only the case in the small number of people but we work the whole range, right? From a fantasy that can come of every once in awhile to one that becomes a necessity or one can now then get sexually.

01:10:25
ESTHER PEREL When I look at the question about what a fantasy expresses in terms of the emotional needs that we bring to our sexual encounters. Then it becomes very clear that it's very difficult to disentangle emotions from sexuality. Meaning that even hit and run sex is never just sex. In some ways sex is never just sex or in another way I would say there is never safe sex because when it really touches you at your core you are always vulnerable which is why some of the most daring fantasies of people require the most amount of trust with a person with whom they can show that part of themselves. A lot of partners we live with someone who will never know that side of them. Uhm, because generally our erotic mind is an absolutes the detector of censorship and knows when it needs to go underground. It fears judgment, it smells judgment and it knows when not to reveal itself. And that's totally fine as well it's not always a necessity. Any of you so Venus in Fur the play has it come out here already? You know, the book? Alright, then it's not relevant. Venus in Fur, Venus in Fur, Venus in Fur was a novel written by a German philosopher author, uhm, Leopold Masoch and, ah, who basically , ah, coined the term S and M. Ah, it's Masoch and the S Sacher Masoch. And from there comes the word S and M. How many of you never knew where is S and M came from? That's one thing you can leave with today. Okay. Uhm, now what is one of the reasons that people are often so silent about their fantasies. Is look-- if everybody fantasized about the bed of roses it wouldn't e a problem to talk about it. But what happens up there in this erotic mind is that we bring off an all kinds of feelings, emotions needs that don't really go hand and hand with our feelings of love. a kind of a darker side. Feelings and needs and expressions of aggression of rawness, of naughtiness, of lust, infantile wishes, selfishness, jealousy, possessiveness. At best we don't think that those are qualities that really create a beautiful love. But they often our intrinsic to people's erotic architecture. That's why when I'd work with couples I always and especially on those subjects I will often alternate between doing individual sessions and couple sessions. I do it in general as part of the way I see couples but certainly when I touch on these material, uhm, and I tell people in the first session that I haven't open secrets policy like Janis Spring developed in which you will talk to me when you are seeing me individually and those will be confidential sessions in which you choose what you want to share with and if when you wanna share it with each other that's your choice. Uhm, and so that frame is set early one but suddenly in working on fantasy, uhm, offering people of private space where they sometimes, ah, for the first time uttering it out loud. And also making sense of it, understanding what they found there. So in the first sessions if people come in to talk about questions of sexuality and the relationship of erotic intimacy of lack of desire, of hyper sexuality you named it I will asked people. I don't generally ask people do you have sex? Because that doesn't tell me much. But I will ask people what the sex mean to you? What do sex mean to you? How important is it in your life? What role that is it play? What does it mean to you? Is it a place where you go in order to, uhm, be able to be to back to this example safely aggressive. Is it a place where you can transcends yourself, the limits of who you are. Is it a place where you second spiritual union with another person. Is it a place where you can finally be taking acre off? Is it the place where you can finally not need to make decisions because somebody else is taking you by the hand. And you can give yourself over in full confidence. Where do you go? What parts of you are you connecting to? Once I begin to ask that question I've introduced the fact that fantasy will become im-- an implicit part of talking about human sexuality not the behavior, not the act but the experience, the subjective experience and the meaning that we give to it. What expectations do you bring to sex is what I'm going to hear. I'm going to listen for and that's what you going to see, uhm, in this, ah, in this tape. Now what happens also in our erotic mind is that, uhm, it's not always a egalitarian space. It's actually a space where we often will go to deal with one of the most important aspects of sexuality which has to do with power and aggression. Freud(ph) knew that and, uhm, feminist have known that and one of the things that have happen is that we sometimes in trying to eradicate abuses of power has always-- have also try to eradicate it out of sexuality. But it doesn't really work this way. In my experiences that if we let people integrate this more rather than compartmentalized it we will have a lot less people having complete secret sexual worlds of which their partners are cut off from when it is at the expense of the partner I'm not talking about erotic privacy. Couples who allow each other, allow of erotic privacy actually often have a lot more erotic intimacy. Do you understand that? Because it allows people to stay in touch with their own erotic self. With their own imagination, with their own fantasy, with their own responsiveness and they can bring that energy to their partner versus couples who often only try to plumb the energy from each other. But thriving on power place or subtle manipulations or unfair advantages or elicit aspirations all of that is what makes it often more difficult for people to wanna share their experiences. And the tape I wanna show you, uhm, it's a couple in their 50s, and, uhm, he's, uhm, he was a policeman now he works in the security, she was an emergency room nurse. Ah, they met in the emergency room it matters you will see why. Uhm, and he grew up in a, ah, very Catholic family. He, uhm, had the father who was also policeman five siblings and a mother who basically sat on the couch watching soap and smoking cigarettes. Now soaps is one big fantasy. You know, even if nothing is shown but that's the whole point of it. In much of great fantasy it's all about what leads to it that's where the charges not in the actual (inaudible ). Uhm, he tells me of a few key experiences for him. One is one time and that's why I'm listening for the paradigmatic moments you know, paradigmatic experiences that will shave the erotic blueprint. One day he sits on the couch with his mother, they watch television his legs touches hers. And he has an absolute moment of terror. but the terror and the pleasure all meet in that one moment. And from there on there is a cal-- and the yearning for the tenderness that he wanted from her and the connection and the attention and none of that, that was becomes transpose and then become sexualized later on and he develops an entire fantasy life of all the women and younger boys. okay. Uhm, he also tells me that, uhm, he use to masturbate under bed, ah, watching the dashboard(ph) and that he have to dad began to develop a prayer which he has now set for you know, 50 plus years in which he basically ask God to forgive him for his lustful inclinations. He never prays to feel that-- to fear that he may be a criminal or a thief it's only about carnality. Uhm, and so I'm going of course ask him if there's a way for him to remain a good Catholic and to change the prayer. Uhm, becau-- because you want people to stay within the framework that, that is the values and the meaning framework that matters to them. Uhm, and in real life of course when he would approach his wife he would approach her and she wasn't always up for it but instead of thinking that he was needy he thought that she was withholding. Now of course in fantasy there was no withholding person they always want it and just as much if not more so and they say more, more, more me to. And they don't make you feel like you want too much they are so delighted to give you exactly what you want. So you never feel like your needy or you want too much or you are a little boy. But in real life every woman that has ever been with a man who expresses desire not a desire but as something that is actually neediness it doesn't wanna have sex with him because many women will be very happy to nurture the little boy but they don't want to have sex with the little boy. I see so many noddings here we should look at each other. Okay. It's you, you-- do you understand? So you get the glitch, you get-- and, and you-- and I will try to create a conversation with them it's a one session that you will see, it's a clip of one session only. Uhm, in which, uhm, I will try to have him understand that there is a difference between needing her and wanting her. But in his fantasies it was able to take care of one by only experiencing the other but that doesn't work in real life with this woman. Now this woman of course he always meet your match, right. This woman grows up in a family where her paradigmatic event that she tells me is-- what I mean by paradigmatic is li-- little experiences or meaningful not their little because they're not little they're powerful experiences that you can link to the shaping of the erotic blueprint as in a formula that goes off in my head that says tell me how you were love and I will tell you how you make loved. And that's another workshop but what I'm saying is I'm listening for how she was loved and what that did the two here sexually to her erotic self. The questions that go with that for her would be, how were you love by whom and how was is it express? Well you protected by the care givers or did you have to flee for protection. Where you allow to thrive or you always meant to close in. Where you allow to want if you're not allow to want you generally have a compromised sexuality. Will you allow to want as in whatever it was a hug, a piece of chocolate, and ice cream you know staying up 5 minutes alter a new dress where you allow to want or where you always told you don't need this what do you need that for you already have enough. If you grow up with the you don't need this you already have enough you can very easily put that as part of a lot of people in this case of woman who will never come. Because you will often think it's taking too long I've already had enough his had his own and it's done. You really need to feel entitle to want to take the time you need to get to where you wanna go. You nodding again, okay. Uhm, so she the questions about will you allow to experience pleasure? And if pleasure have a value for its own or was it only something that you get when you really work hard and you get a tiny reward at the end. Or was pleasure the ability to luxuriate to just be without having to do without having prove yourself was that a value in life not sexually just the value in life. Will you allow to eat for pleasure or for sustenance. Was excess tolerate it, excess is an intrinsic quality for sexuality. And suddenly in the sexual fantasy world. Where you rock, where you held, where you sued, or where you humiliate it or violate it or never touch or invisible. And her story is a story of invisibility and that plot she gives is one day I vomit it the whole night I was a child, I was sick and I didn't wanna wake anybody up because I was-- I didn't wanna bother them and so I just dealt with it by myself the whole night and in the morning I left a little crumb on the corner of my mouth to see if somebody would noticed. Now you translate that into how this woman make love? Okay. So when they arrived to me, uhm, the have been to a retreat the kind of a workshop that I do with couples and in the retreat, uhm, I tell people at the end of the weekend if you have a chance come and meet with me at least once again later or meet with your therapist but find the way of anchoring this experience because we all know that many retreats had a 2 week high and then fictitious. And so she basically comes in a few months later they come in and, uhm, I see them for 4 hours. many of my sessions are 2 hour long at this point. Uhm, and you will see like 2 minutes of the first session and then everything else is just the second session. But she tells me that she always thought that what was part of what she told was part of the turn on material and we gonna hopefully do something with the had to do with bubble bath and massage back and stroke my face and soft tender and that in fact she realized that this wasn't at all what she really wanted. Women much more than men will impose even strict your censorship into their sexual longings. You know, they are more likely generally, people in sexuality are more likely to do what they think there's they're allow to do versus what they really want, in their intimate relationship but women even more than man. So describes and in fact she realized that, uhm, she wasn't to a whole different scene and now becomes the trick you listen to it and if you don't immediately think you know what it means because you get seduced by the accoutrements or by the toys or by the plots then you begin to stay and you remember you asked what expectations do you bring to your fantasy? How does this fantasy answer your deepest emotional needs. Not what ex-- and, and therefore of course it excites because that's the part of it. Then you begin-- I began to realized that in fact what she begin to stage was not at all about what I thought it was about. You could very easily get trick by the plot rather than by the longing, the yearning behind it. Okay. So a fantasy expresses the problem and finds the solution. And so it becomes perverts space where the fear can be transformed into brazenness or the shame into curiosity or the tumidity into assertiveness or the helplessness into sovereignty. Uhm, if he didn't want to ask in his erotic imaginations the other women know exactly what he wants. If she feel guilty if in her imagination she can surrender to a powerful, lustful other without having to take any responsibility for it. And what begins to transform here-- by the way if she had been into being a mom sexually liking to play mom I would not if I meet them either do you understand? It's because she wants a man because of-- because she wants a man period. She wants and adult man she's not into that game. That, uhm, she wants him to translate what, what you know, his childhood need into an adult desire basically. So let me take some comments and questions and then we move on. Reactions yes, but you gonna the mike brought to you. So can you bring her the mike please. I saw some of you really struggle through watching the tape rather than comfort so you could actually read I don't you didn't suffer too much. Ah, the real, ah, aficionado of suffering here. Yes. 

01:29:05
UNKNOWN At the beginning of this kind of work how-- what kinds of questions do you ask the couple to get them to talk about their fantasies because in my experience people will say they don't fantasized. 

01:29:20
ESTHER PEREL Yes, uhm, well look are there's a lot of different entry points, okay. It's a great question but so I said, what are the first question I ask is what does sex mean to you? Okay. Let's say like this. A couple comes to see me sometimes couples and more and more at this point do come to see me because they know I work in the area of sexuality. So there-- that already is more identified you know, understand. Other couples come in for all kinds of other reasons and I been introduced that subject pretty much into weak one. I just say and how is the relationship sexually between the two of you. You know, in my mind like Barry Mccarthy(ph) says, as if its good it probably takes up 20% of the couple but if it's not good it takes up 75% of the couple. And I happen to be a therapist identify now with this subject so I get a lot of couples who have gone through a lot of good therapy sometimes without ever touching the subject. And then they'll come and they say this is the one thing we've never talk about. So they come motivate it at least of all-- officially motivate it. Okay. But in general I basically just inquire you know, uhm, how important is it, how satisfying is it and when I mean good I mean enjoyable satisfying I don't really mean how frequents. Okay. I pay attention to the extent and this is gonna tell you something about working with fantasy on the extent to which the people have embrace of you of sexuality that is rather masculine, genital and goal oriented. Five minutes before the real thing is called into-- in-- foreplay followed by intercourse orgasm and then sleep. You know, ah, to what extent is it that progression and then from there they can see we have sex, we don't have sex, you know, but I mean, after Clinton all bets are lose for what is sex, you know. Uhm, so I, I want to understand what-- the way they speak about it what is their language you know. Then I will asked a question which is a mini exercises that I think we can do actually in which I will ask because of course I'm entering to which through the door of desire, right? I'm not entering to it just because I'm curious about people fantasies. I'm entering to it because I really think that I will learn something about a person that it gives me and look inside a individual intrapsychically and interpersonally that is unique. Uhm, uhm, because it is-- because of its metaphor because it is not linear content, okay. Uhm, so I will say ask the question in a mini exercise will you were pair yourself do it for 2 minutes with each other you've get a sense. Pair up who ever sits next to you, pair up, pair up, pair up. I'm not just gonna tell you. All right. You haven't-- okay. Now, you don't yet what you're gonna do it together. So just very briefly I'll demonstrate it you know, just so you ever since of how this works. The question is I turn myself off when or I turn myself off by? Now that is not the same as you turn me off when and what turns me off is? We are the holders of our erotic agency of our desires. So I turn myself off when I do emails before going to bed. I'll repeat for out loud. 

01:33:10
UNKNOWN Ah, I turn myself off, ah, by worrying about-- I turn myself off by worrying about all the things I need to do the next day. 

01:33:20
ESTHER PEREL I turn myself off when I haven't taken anytime for myself. 

01:33:30
UNKNOWN I turn myself off when I don't take care of myself or, or if when I don't stop being mom. 

01:33:40
ESTHER PEREL I turn myself off when I worry about the kids. 

01:33:45
UNKNOWN I turn myself off when I work too hard. 

01:33:50
ESTHER PEREL It's very different than you turn me off when blah, blah, blah. And what turns me off is that, that, that, you know. So now you gonna do this back and forth when I do it in the office they do it and I write. I write it just so that I can read it back to them. Okay. So if there's anywhere a three, a three people group here then have one of you write it and if you're comfortable then will read do this at the level that you're comfortable doing this with. But have a sense of what it's like because you'll see the kinds of materials that come up. What you will noticed is this people talking about sexuality isn't about talking about the explicitness of sexuality. It's a whole other place we go to resource ourselves and not getting tricked by what it looks like. So that's what she was trying to say, you know, what is it about being blindfolded or being attached it's not because she wants anything to be done to her on pleasant or for store impose it's because when she is attached she doesn't have to give back. In a life of a woman who for 26 years has done for the others all the time and not even cuz she like it but just because then she knows she's good and she doesn't have to feel bad. And that's a lifetime script for you. Emotionally and sexually, okay. And that script enters into her pores, that script is on her skin it's not just in her mind neither just in her emotional life. It's in her erotic life. Okay. It will age her much faster. So go one, two, three. I turn myself off by or I turn myself off when. Is this struggling, I'll ask him. Okay. Okay, alright. Hello. Don't get too excited. So, uhm, hello. And this is only on the question of turning yourself off what it will be when I ask you what turns you on. You know, so, uhm, other any can we hear any voices just when a-- what, what struck you? What's to doubt? Did anybody write that wants to read them and let just, ah, get some material. You wanna just, ah, yeah. 

01:36:30
UNKNOWN It seems like a common theme that we get-- when you in your head like you're thinking about whatever instead of being at the moment. 

01:36:40
ESTHER PEREL Ah-ah, it's when you're thinking about whatever instead of being in the moment. However, people, uhm, the, the pre-- what is the assumption underneath this that good sex should just happen spontaneously, right? Like a deus sex machina that falls from heaven while you're folding the laundry, you know. The notion is this is the strange idea because this is the notion that sex should just happen you know, whatever is going to just happen in the long term relationship already has. So no, it's not when you're in your head, when you're in, in sex you are often very much in your head. But you are present in the head that leads to this. Its just as much of a head trip. The head and the mind is the biggest sexual organ we have it's just that we are not destructed with another head with other thoughts it's not about just being in your body it's both. But it very much ease in being your mind but it's about being present to the very thing that you're actually doing. Okay. Uhm, yeah, you're gonna say something? About how hard it was. 

01:37:50
UNKNOWN Ah, what we're talking about it seems it-- it's more likely for, ah, men to not be distracted by what's on their head and what's going on and women but not wanting though (inaudible ). 

01:38:06
ESTHER PEREL Uh-uh. Okay. So the idea is that the sentence here is that this person things that it is easier a for men not to be destructed. Uhm, all the studies there's more interesting studies on male sexuality which I really recommend you to read some of Marta Meana's work totally go against this whole idea. Man no different than women are affected by their internal life when it comes to their sexuality. Let's get rid of some stereotypes for a minute. If he's depress or anxious or feels lousy at work or feels like he's not done well. Or his worried about something his internal states he doesn't feel proud or it doesn't feel accomplished or doesn't feel whatever the internal state for men and for women is no different in its influence the kinds of elements may not be the same. But the internal state that internal affect influences both men and women. The difference is that men more likely than women may sometimes turn to sex to help them with that internal states. But it doesn't make the internal state not important. Do you understand me? 

01:39:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:39:20
ESTHER PEREL Yeah. Okay. Marta Meana at the University of Las Vegas, uhm, I think is doing some of the most impor-- interesting studies on, uhm, desire and sexuality Marta. Marta Meana, you were gonna say something. you forgot, okay, others. Yes. 

01:39:50
UNKNOWN I for quit, ah, individually with some couples - 

01:39:50
ESTHER PEREL Sorry. 

01:39:50
UNKNOWN - who would answer that question who answer it with me, uhm, I get turn-- I turn myself off when I look at the other person or look at the other persons naked body. 

01:40:05
ESTHER PEREL Uh-uh. 

01:40:05
UNKNOWN And I'm wondering how what do you do with that at that point? 

01:40:05
ESTHER PEREL Uh-uh. Then I-- then here is the thing. If that is said in the session in front of the partner I do nothing. I think to myself I may gonna-- I'm gonna talk with this person alone. There are-- I happen to think that certain thing should never be said. Because they will never be forgotten. I do not believe that we just that more revelation is by definition the direct route to intimacy. 

01:40:35
UNKNOWN So when-- but you're asking this question and that's the main (inaudible )... 

01:40:41
ESTHER PEREL So that you just said it's just left like that. But I'm going to the second question. I'm going to the question. First of all you know, in my head let me put you this way. I could interpret this when I look at you I turn myself off when I look at you can mean because you've allowed yourself to neglect yourself because you have getting older, because, ah, uhm, I don't think I deserve you, ah, let's not just go for the obvious because I have not been good to you. Be-- it's not just the visual I don't proclaim to know what it means that's the first thing it's an easy sentence to track you to you, you're got thing is to think, oh, he or she it's a ne-- this case it's a he or she or whoever both is looking at the other and doesn't like what they see. You know, in any, you know, but of course the other so there's all the four pieces of every added and what I-- those who add is and when is the last time you allowed your partner to know that in even matters how you look like because you don't even noticed or tell, tell or tell them the difference. So underneath that statement for me is an entire relational dynamic on the subject of attraction, desire, and rejection. But in the moment I do nothing because I don't know. And with then but I have-- but I just know don't go for the obvious. 

01:42:15
UNKNOWN Now I have these people tell me individually I'm afraid to ask the question with them both in the room. 

01:42:20
ESTHER PEREL Yes. Right. So what-- so they have told you individually what that they are not attracted to each other? 

01:42:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:42:25
ESTHER PEREL Right. 

01:42:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:42:30
ESTHER PEREL Okay. But, uhm, in the-- and the conclusion of that is what I'm not-- I'm not attracted and rest of the sentence is what? 

01:42:40
UNKNOWN And I-- and I want to make this worth for both of them. 

01:42:45
ESTHER PEREL No, no you're talking about you I'm asking about the couple. The couple says I'm not attracted to my partner both of you have told you that in confidence both by themselves and the rest of the sentence is what? That's only the first part of a sentence. Did you understand? That's only the first part of the sentence I'm not, you know, I see quantities of couples who have no desire for their partner who they think is exquisitely attractive. There's no connection, it's not an obvious connection. It they, they have something to do with each other but which way it works we don't know. Common some people have had the greatest sex with people they can't stand. And don't necessary even think I'm so beautiful but something else happen what-- so the next of you as a therapist watch the rest of the sentence. Unless I knew the rest of the sentence I cannot make any suggestion to you and any meaning of what needs to happen in this moment. You follow me? 

01:43:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:43:50
ESTHER PEREL Don't get trick and in the subject of sexuality don't ever think you know what people are telling you. Ask again, ask again and ask again and don't take one word and fill in your meaning of its. You will not necessarily be on the right track it's really sleuth, work, sleuth, sleuth I loved that word in English. You know, is like, you know, with the flashlight like that and you think you've reach the corner enough you go to another one it's that kind of so you have to be super presents. Don't stay general or you won't understand and they will stay stock for years. Yeah, where's the mike? Yeah. Go ahead, but I, I wanna go back to that questions so you need to do part two of the exercise. 

01:44:40
UNKNOWN Do you think that, uhm, Fifty Shades of Grey is making eroticism and for women more acceptable. 

01:44:45
ESTHER PEREL Okay, let's leave Fifty Shades of Grey for afterwards that's, ah, taking me to another track. Uhm, but go ahead and then I'm gonna do part two I want you to see where this goes. 

01:45:00
UNKNOWN I just want you to respond to him that what-- you wouldn't-- would you bring he say he heard that in individual therapy from this two. 

01:45:10
ESTHER PEREL Say that again. 

01:45:10
UNKNOWN He said that he heard this in the couples where they saw them individually you would not then probably I would think not bringing that in the couples work until you knew more.. 

01:45:20
ESTHER PEREL No, I would not bring this in the couples work until I know more. I think that what I'm saying is there are certain things that I don't think one person, uhm, should tell their partner. But what I mean when I say it like that as it if I'm the police and I decide should be said and not be said. What I'm thinking is, uhm, I, I said something about that this morning, you know, this is a culture that believes in explicit messages. It really likes black and white and it thinks in the moral cure in the candid nature of honesty as laying it out there. It has loads of words get our-- get to the point don't beat around the bush, say what you have to say. It exalts directness but sexuality is a realm that is a lot more ambiguous, a lot more imponderable, a lot more indirect, a lo-- a lot less unvarnished like that to say to your partner of many years certain sexual truths that they may not really understand yet. I will often first make sure I know what we're talking about and then examine with them how they can bring this into the conversation with their partner. But not throughout one of those things you know, I'm just not attracted to you. One of-- you get those lines, you know? This one 20 years back. I had the couple yesterday he told her 22 years ago that she didn't like the way she kiss and that's the end of kissing for this couple. These things they stay with you, you just like, like, like, ah, like a birth mark from, from God knows what you know. So I, I by the way this one doesn't work not as well alright upper mike myself. Were up two mikes. Okay. Uhm, so that's what I mean by I wouldn't bring it into that session but I will write it and then when I read it back you know, uhm, now in this instance you heard it separately so it's a different story. Okay. But still I'm repeating to this person unless I know the next part of the sentence, you know. If somebody says I'm not just-- I'm just not attracted then sometimes I may ask you know, uhm, in what ways do you motivate him or her to become more attractive? that's already one thing. You know, because I'll find it always-- you know, why do I ask that question because the amount of people who have become attracted you know, uhm, how would I say this. I the lot of the couples that I work with after affairs is extraordinary how one person instantly becomes attractive. There's no better weight loss. You know, it's a crazy weight loss but there is something about suddenly the person takes him a matter in hands and just stop because there was no motivation anymore there was a completely deroticized(ph) relationship in which none of these mattered anymore. So when you say I'm not attracted to my partner I wanna know what's your-- what do you have to do with this. You know, or ask the couple of recently I said to, to, uhm, what's one vulnerability that she grapples with I said. And he said, the way-- she know she doesn't always like the way she looks in her, her weight and all of that and then I said and what's been your contributions to that? And what ways have you been helpful or not and he said, "I probably make it worst." Now, if I didn't proceed with all of that he could be sitting alone in the room with me and saying I'm not attracted to her she gain a lot of weight. That doesn't tell me the full story. Alright, I turn myself on when. I turn myself on by. So I turn myself on when, uhm, I go dancing and I turn myself on. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN I would say the same thing dancing. 

01:49:35
ESTHER PEREL Dancing. And I turn myself on when I think about, uhm, some of the great places that we have been. 

01:49:40
UNKNOWN I turn myself on when I have nothing to do. 

01:49:50
ESTHER PEREL Don't you wanna spend some time with her? And I turn myself on when I think about my exes. And I turn myself on when I remember ourselves in the beginning and I turn myself on when I read a good novel. And I turn myself on-- what you will notice is that often it's about how I take care of myself actually. And how I take care and respond to the quality of our relationship. It's not-- sometimes it's when I see you and there is nudity and there is other more sexually explicit things. What I mean by explicit is just sexual things per se rather than things that elicit sexuality. So go ahead, I turn myself on by which is not what turns me on is or you turn me on when. Go. Okay, all right. Uhm, I see we have time creeping in on us. So, uhm, what kind of stuff did you hear? Give me a few. I turn myself on when by what kind of things came up, yes. By having unstructured time. 

01:51:00
UNKNOWN Buying shoes. 

01:51:05
ESTHER PEREL Buying shoes. When there's no kids at home. 

01:51:10
UNKNOWN Thinking about having an affair. 

01:51:15
ESTHER PEREL Thinking about having an affair. Going to the opera. Huh? A new venue, a new place. 

01:51:20
UNKNOWN When I'm at the beach, massage, dance. 

01:51:25
ESTHER PEREL When I'm-- when I'm at the beach, I have a massage, I dance. 

01:51:30
UNKNOWN When I take this class. 

01:51:30
ESTHER PEREL When I take this class? 

01:51:35
[sil.] 

01:51:40
ESTHER PEREL So, uhm, more any other, yes. 

01:51:45
UNKNOWN When I do something physical. 

01:51:45
ESTHER PEREL When I do something physical. Yes. when I remember the past between us. When I dress sexy. When I attend to my own sexuality. When I connect with my own erotic self. If I don't do that my partner can jump hopes and do anything I won't respond the shop is close. That's why Is ay to him do you experience her wanting and he says, "Yes." I say, "Do you feel entitle to her wanting?" and says, "No." It's very easy you complain about how the other person isn't interested in you which you did for all this years. But a part of that is because he wasn't interested in her he just wanted her to be interested in him so he could feel interesting. I want you to desire me so that I feel desired and desirable. Is not the same as I come to you because I really want you. Is not the same as when I ask you after and experience how was it and you're telling me it was really nice because you really know that I'm asking you how was it for you versus how was I. And it says please reassure me that, that I'm okay. Okay, so I start with the question like this for example at which point at one point I can ask you want an example of a fantasy that came up recently. This couple comes in and basically he says to her, "No." and says to me, "I'm the woman in this relationship and I'm gonna give some, uhm, none straight couples two just so we get this thing a little bit broader here." Uhm, but I'm thinking of them because its recently done. And, uhm, basically she says you know, we never talk about sex. So I see you know, would you like to talk about sex? I said you know, "I've never heard a couple wanting more sex by talking about the sex they don't want." You know, that is not the way you get in there. So what is it that you in there in that space I'm talking about. So I-- then I said to her, "Would you like to talk about, uhm, would like to talk about sexuality?" So she says, "Yes." So then she turns in and she says to him you know, we never talk about sex. So I realized that's gonna you know, that, that hasn't turn it around enough. And I see-- and I see, uhm, I say to her, uhm, "If sexuality was the way you want it with him how would it be?" And so she, uhm, describes to me that it would be frequent, he would want her, it would be creative, imaginative, playful, in various places you know, general things. And I said to him and what would you like if sexuality was good between the two of you and he describes. And then I said, "I want you to think of an experience that you had where some of these things that makes sexuality pleasurable and fulfilling for you were present. But I never says specifically with him or with her I just thought on general. And then she says, he go first. Because she has feel rejected by him quite a bit. So he starts to tell the story about, uhm, uhm, so he right, he said it was so fun exclusive, integrated part of our relationship, uncomplicated and frequent. Okay, and then he starts to talk one day she came, she flew over, he waited for her at the airport. She was wearing short skirt you know, mini dress whatever. Uhm, I'm not particularly listening to the details I want you to understand that there's a way that you listen without really listing because you nog there to be titillate it and be of what you. So I listen and ask his talking what I'm watching is to see. Is she there? Is he there? That's the difference between the memory and the fantasy by the way often it happens in the present tense you're in it. So at one point I say to her if she want as I said, "You know, if you close your eyes you'll see more." Right? If you close your eyes you'll see more, you'll the Copenhagen airport I didn't say that. I just said if you close your eyes you may see more. to let to give her the permission to actually go back now this is after a few years of really bad relationship between the two of them right. So he tells and he talks about how much she wanted her and how he was and how they went home and made love and it doesn't really matter. What matters to me is to watch her say to him, I didn't even know you still remember it. And for him to actually you know, be able to still fantasized and to still have that fantasies. To still be able to ero-- eroticized them as a couple which is an experience of hope. Then she tells a story and she talks about how they were traveling and then, ah, she had meet him under road. they meet in on, on a trip in Asia and, and you know, he gave her a wonderful experience and she had her orgasm and you know, ah, ejaculatory or orgasm with him etcetera and it really doesn't matter what the story was but again I said, you know, if you want you may find yourself going back there more easily if you close your eyes then I said you know, if you wanna put-- if you wanna sit in a place that allows you to remember the story better just sits the way you need to sit. So they just kind of basically put their feet on the chair and you can see them going you know, on the memory lane. They're going on a little journey because sex isn't something to do it just a place you go. So I wanna see can they still go there because if they can go there I can don't I, I won't you know, you need to know if they still is a space they can enter together. Then I ask, uhm, him, uhm, if, uhm, how it was basically to do this kind of thing. And at one points he said to me, uhm, it wasn't so comfortable because you were there. It was like you don't belong here. And then I knew were okay, you know, because that means they ready to close the door behind them and they don't need my presence. Uhm, that's another way of asking about fantasy I don't ask people talk about your fantasies. I do if I have a person like yesterday the one with the couple with the kiss you know, and he basically for many years has been in porn has done his masturbation, his into some much more rough raw edgy stuff. And he has an enormously powerful, spiritual, artistic connection with his wife but they have sex as he says maybe eight times a year. And basically she then says I don't think he has ever been ful-- fundamentally I don't think his ever been attracted to me. That is not what I was about for him. And meanwhile in order not to rock the boat she has put her entire sexuality in the storage place and hope that she won't come with too much so that it won't create a disequilibrium they have a foreign and 8 year old and so then I began to talk and he basically reach the point why now you always ask the couple why are you here now today? You know, you've done this for all this years and somehow it has been okay between the two of you. And if you know, the reason not an okay, moment which is called the men turns 52 and at one point he gets up when then he says, is this is it? Or the woman wakes up or any person for that matter one point gets up and says, is there more? Or will this be the rest of my life for the next 25 years. And so I really praise them for their courage to actually come and share the question is this it with 'em and let see together if there is more. And so the first more here becomes for these woman do not every time she thinks about sex she thinks about the sex he wants and she actually does no longer have a connection to her own sexuality. But, but then she started to talk about you know, the interesting thing is this we are both narcissist he's whole thing is about you know, these women who are all about him because he found very early on that he'd then think his penis had the right size and so he never fail that he and a lot of predatory feelings and fears and so his halting was about women who come on to him and want him and they are not necessarily the good girls and he doesn't have to worry about them but he didn't marry that one of course. And she finds herself with, uhm, wanting actually someone who is equally totally delighted about giving to her and not about somebody who just wants him so that he can feel so good about him. So too narcissist wanting the other people adoration makes for allow his sexual relationship, right? In their fantasy thing so she starts to talk about the fireman. You know, she ac-- she uses it not as a real thing as a metaphor for I actually want someone who would be delighted in making me feel good and not the one who gets off on somebody who is all you know, into it by herself wanting him I need you to make you know, you're wanting me, makes me want it. I'm not the person who starts with the wanting it on its own terms. So then I said-- I said you know, you need a new space to have conversations about this and we introduced the texting email because he travels a lot and so I figure to have lots of long distance possible. And, uhm, we're going to-- make that space come to life. Right? The space that love work so hard to close, desire is going to work so hard to open back up and bring back to life. That would be an introduction to working with fantasy and I wish you all the way. Thank you.
