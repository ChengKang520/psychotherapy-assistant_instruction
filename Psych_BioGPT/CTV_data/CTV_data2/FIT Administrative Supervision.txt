Microtraining Associates Presents FIT Administrative Supervision: Undestanding the Data Generated by Routine Outcome and Alliance Measurement with Scott D. Miller, intro with Julie Tilsen, Ph.D. Training Director, ICCE 

00:00:25
JULIE TILSEN Hi. I'm Julie Tilsen, training director for the International Center for Clinical Excellence. The ICCE is the world's largest online community of behavioral health providers and it exist in order to provide support for those providers who are committed to improving their effectiveness and developing excellence in the services they provide. Today, I'm here with Scott Miller, who is the director of the ICCE. 

00:00:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Hi Julie. 

00:00:55
JULIE TILSEN Hey Scott, hi. 

00:00:55
SCOTT D. MILLER How are you doing? 

00:00:55
JULIE TILSEN All right. 

00:00:55
SCOTT D. MILLER It's good to be back together again. 

00:00:55
JULIE TILSEN Yes, back together making our second FIT training video. 

00:01:00
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:01:00
Scott Miller, Ph.D. Director, ICCE 

00:01:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:01:00
SCOTT D. MILLER First video was really about establishing and presenting basic FIT practices. 

00:01:10
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:01:10
SCOTT D. MILLER How do you introduce the measures, how do you use the measures, a little bit about interpreting, and then doing that with some clinical content, some case vignettes. 

00:01:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so in that first video, we demonstrated and talked about - 

00:01:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:01:20
JULIE TILSEN - how to begin doing feedback and form treatment - 

00:01:25
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:01:25
JULIE TILSEN - and today we're here to talk about and demonstrate how to supervise FIT practice. 

00:01:35
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:01:35
JULIE TILSEN Why are we here doing this, why did we decide we needed to follow up with a supervision video? 

00:01:40
http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=249 

00:01:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, it's very clear now that FIT is an effective form of enhancing your effectiveness. We have multiple randomized clinical trials, and also, now FIT has been approved by SAMSHA - the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration as an evidence-based practice. You can read about that on the samsha.gov website under PCOMS International Center for Clinical Excellence version. Of course, I think many people thought that it was simply a matter of filling out the measures, having people administer them, and that would take care of it, and what experience has taught us is that the process of using the scales and especially implementing them, both on an individual provider basis and on an agency basis is a more difficult and challenging process. 

00:02:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, uhm, I think we've talked about-- I think of it as being a a very sophisticated and nuanced practice really situated within a responsive, relational way of working with people. 

00:02:40
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:02:40
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, and so, and moving toward this supervision training video, we're trying to slow down and linger around some of those areas where people need that kind of support and opportunity to reflect on and further develop their practice of FIT. 

00:02:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, and reflection is exactly the right word, and I know you hope as I do that with both the first video and this, this video, that people take the time to stop and start think about things as they try it out. We notice that, much like learning a different language, it's probably gonna take a year to two years before you really fully understand all the nuances, and supervision is a piece of that, getting connected with a community or a coach, somebody who is knowledgeable about this that can really help you implement the measures fully in your clinical practice. 

00:03:30
JULIE TILSEN Okay. So before we head too far into what specifically we mean by the supervision of feedback and form treatment practice - 

00:03:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:03:40
JULIE TILSEN - let's talk about what our ideas are. What is supervision? 

00:03:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. Well, we know that everybody talks about it and that word seems to hide a, ah, much diversity in conceptualization and in practice. If you look at some classic definitions, for example, the latest Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change, the bible - 

00:04:00
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:04:05
SCOTT D. MILLER - of, ah, outcome research, they cite, two researchers, Fillinder(ph) and Shafranske, from 2004 that says "Supervision involves a relationship between a supervisor and a supervisee that promotes the professional development of the supervisee through interpersonal processes, including mutual problem-solving, instruction, evaluation, mentoring and role modeling of ethical practice." That's a mouthful. 

00:04:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so when you, if you start parsing out that mouthful, what, what in that definition really resonates or strikes a chord for you when you think about what you would hope to be happening in, in the supervision of FIT practice? 

00:04:40
SCOTT D. MILLER First of all, a relationship between a supervisor and supervisee. Relationship is key to FIT practice between professional helpers and the people they serve. It should also be key, and is key between the supervisor and the supervisee. That's, that's one of the main things. The second thing is certainly some kind of instruction. People are coming to the supervisor to learn how to do something. That's part of our tradition as well, mostly in the area of, of treatment models. We're gonna learn how to do a particular treatment model here. We're learning how to use the measures and become competent at that. But the second part, and probably the most important part about FIT supervision is it's designed to improve the supervisee's effectiveness when working with people. 

00:05:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay. So when we think about supervision and you look to a definition like that - 

00:05:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:05:30
JULIE TILSEN - and you pull out some of those things that particularly resonate around FIT practice, is there anything that a definition like that is missing that you think is also central to the practice of supervising feedback and form treatment? 

00:05:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, a huge missing component is the second piece that I mentioned, that, really, from our perspective, if the supervision doesn't help the clients being served, then I really question the purpose of it, and so far, the research literature is both silent on the effectiveness of supervision, despite the fact that some countries that people get regular supervision, despite the fact that most licensed professionals here in the United States have to get supervision in order to be licensed. There's very little evidence that it actually works, that it actually improves skills. There's some data that suggests that it can help you learn a particular skill, but there is no evidence that it benefits the consumer of behavioral health services, which is really at the heart of FIT supervision practice. 

00:06:35
JULIE TILSEN So would you say that working backwards from client outcomes, that would be a way to, at least in part, evaluate, determine the effectiveness of the supervisee, supervision? 

00:06:50
SCOTT D. MILLER I can say this: I don't think consumers care if we're competent at something that doesn't help them - 

00:06:55
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:06:55
SCOTT D. MILLER - and so, yes, I think if you combine FIT supervision practice with what we know from the literature on expertise and excellence, if you start with outcome and then begin to work backwards, especially noticing those parts of your practice that don't seem to benefit the client, you will become competent at helping the people that you work with more aptly, more ably. 

00:07:15
JULIE TILSEN Okay. When you think about this definition and these components that we've been reviewing briefly here of supervision, um, does that bring to mind a definition you would favor for FIT super-- the FIT supervision or the supervision of FIT practice or some little mantra or something that you would want to kind of capture the spirit of the supervision of FIT practice? 

00:07:45
Cynthia Maeschalck ICCE Community Manager 

00:07:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, not off the top of my head. I can't think of anything that captures just the essence or the spirit of it. I think that it's been, the components of FIT supervision practice have been laid out very nicely, for example, by the current community manager of ICCE, Cynthia Maeschalck, and Cynthia really was the author of the FIT training manual on clinical supervision. It's manual number three in the FIT Treatment and Training Manual series, and she talks about two pieces to the FIT supervision model. One is the administrative part of it. That's, we'd say, more about people learning how to use the measures and the scales and making sure that they're actually using them productively. Then, there's the clinical piece. What does all this data mean that you're generating? 

00:08:30
For information regarding all 6 training manuals visit www.centerforclinicalexcellence.com 

00:08:30
SCOTT D. MILLER And how do you use that feedback to inform your practice, and both of those elements are things that are talked about in the manual and that I think you will see featured on this particular video. 

00:08:40
JULIE TILSEN So Scott, that's interesting. Now, I was asking about if there's sort of an essence or a spirit. Something you wanted people to, like, I think of handhold. Something to take with them to remember, organize around. And you talked about two particular components. 

00:08:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:08:55
JULIE TILSEN Administrative and clinical. 

00:08:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:08:55
JULIE TILSEN Can you say a little bit more about those? 

00:09:00
SCOTT D. MILLER I, I can say more about those and I can also just comment briefly about this idea of essence. 

00:09:05
JULIE TILSEN Perfect. 

00:09:05
SCOTT D. MILLER I'm always worried about assuming that there is a right way to do this. We are learning so much every time we interact with professionals who are trying to use these measures to improve the outcomes they, they, they're having with other people they work with. And so, I stay away from essence and instead try to describe as closely as I can what I'm hearing other people say they're doing and also what we're doing. And I mentioned those two pieces, administrative, which is the nuts and bolts. How do you do it? Let's make sure that people are actually using the forms in a useful way. Let's make sure that they're using them at all which will become important, for example, in agency settings. 

00:09:40
2 Types of Supervision 1) Administrative 2) Clinical 

00:09:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Where, when you first start to implement, not everybody may be equally enthusiastic about this. Then, the second piece is the clinical supervision. This is the heart of it. This is what, of course, I, I really love to do, and for us, we've really borrowed heavily from David Melee(ph) and Bill Plum(ph), who had talked about how to do a supervision model in a clinical context that was both user- friendly and cut straight to the chase, and they had three components in this process. David Melee, of course, is a physician, and his idea was let's get the basic information out. Therapists love story, they love narrative, and, frequently, if you're at a case consultation or a supervision meeting, these can go on for a long time with lots of detail, and it's easy, as a listener, to get lost in some of that, so the first part of the FIT supervision model is get the basic information out on the table. This shouldn't take longer than two minutes. And as you'll hear me say in the first clinical vignette, sometimes, I recommend that people have an egg timer. Two minutes. Name, age, gender affiliation, presenting complaint or a problem, whether there's a trauma history, drug and alcohol, prescription drug use - that basic information. Let's get that out in two minutes. 

00:11:00
JULIE TILSEN So it's interesting. You know, I really appreciate the idea of not getting, uhm, fixed and organized around an essence, yet you also talk about a model of supervision . 

00:11:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:11:15
JULIE TILSEN I think there's tension between - 

00:11:15
SCOTT D. MILLER There is always. 

00:11:15
JULIE TILSEN - trying to stay flexible and fluid and, and avoid essentializing something but also talking about a model. 

00:11:20
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:11:20
JULIE TILSEN Do you think of this supervision we're talking about here as a model of supervision or how, how, how do you try to think about that? 

00:11:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Guidelines, ideas, current description. You know, you can build a model of the Starship Enterprise that's not taken yet to outer space. Ah, you can't even get on the damn thing. So that's the way to think about it. You're gonna have to make it come alive in the work that you, that you actually do and chances are, it will change. 

00:11:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, sounds like it's really more an approach, a way of positioning yourself in the work. 

00:11:50
SCOTT D. MILLER For now. 

00:11:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:11:55
SCOTT D. MILLER And hopefully, as we learn more, as we, ah, ah, apply these ideas with more diverse people and in more diverse settings, we'll grow as well. That's why I think that it's important to just describe these basic steps. 

00:12:05
- Basic client information - Review the outcome scores 

00:12:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Again, number one is kind of the, the, get the information out. Number two, or the second piece, and you'll see this also in the first clinical vignette, is to look at the graph. So you've administered the ORS and the SRS. This results in a graphical representation of the client's functioning, how do they say they're doing - 

00:12:25
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:12:25
- Review the alliance 

00:12:25
SCOTT D. MILLER - how do they feel about the work. Have the, have the fo-- person look at the graph decide. Does the graph indicate progress or stalemate or worsening, and it's generally quite obvious. And then the third piece is to, if the team agrees that there's a stalemate or that no progress is being made or there's worsening, then you talk through the alliance. 

00:12:55
JULIE TILSEN So that you're actually asking, essentially, from the client's perspective, is there progress, is there stalemate, is there something else, is there some of all of those things - 

00:13:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:13:05
JULIE TILSEN - so that it isn't just the supervisor, the supervisee or the team. You're trying to invoke the client's risk. 

00:13:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, that's interesting on so many levels, Julie, because, first off, there's very little evidence, ah, that supervision improves outcomes. Secondly, you've got two people together whose own ratings of the relationship and outcome don't seem to correlate very well from a bunch of research from, ah, with the client's ratings, so in a way, traditional supervision, two people in a room talking could be viewed as gossip. 

00:13:35
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:13:35
SCOTT D. MILLER It's not really related to the person being served, and so by going back in part three to the alliance, essentially, what we're saying is get close to the client again. 

00:13:45
JULIE TILSEN Right, right. 

00:13:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Much of what may be responsible for a lack of progress or a stalemate is that the helper and the helpee have somehow parted ways. This process is to put them close, back in close proximity once again. 

00:14:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. And it seems to me that, when you're, you're looking at, uhm, the ORS and the SRS scores and the relationship between the two and you're looking at the trajectories and if you're looking at more aggregate data from a particular practitioner, if you're wanting to get a bigger picture of their overall practice - 

00:14:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:14:20
JULIE TILSEN The thing to remember then is that those are a elaboration of the client's voice - 

00:14:25
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:14:25
JULIE TILSEN - and, and for me, I'm always wanting to remind people this is one way the client described, at that time, their experience. 

00:14:30
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:14:35
JULIE TILSEN - and, and to sort of underscore that piece, and I guess I'm thinking about that, because you talked about part three, going to the alliance - 

00:14:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:14:40
JULIE TILSEN - but I'm always trying to think that that's, that's sort of the place that I'm holding here all the time. 

00:14:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. And I think practitioners, for the most part, really do try to do that, and despite our intentions - 

00:14:55
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:14:55
SCOTT D. MILLER - in reality, that sometimes just doesn't happen, and for the best possible reasons, we end up in different places. Ah, so that alliance is huge and it's important. Forty-seven percent of people drop out of services before achieving a reliable change, so the biggest threat to treatment outcome is drop-out. We're trying to re-engage. And what is the alliance? 

00:15:15
FIT Supervision Using the Alliance Client preferences Goals Therapist role Means/Methods INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR CLINICAL EXCELLENCE 

00:15:15
SCOTT D. MILLER As you know, we use a three-legged stool as an analogy to describe it. The three foundational pieces of that alliance are: agreement on goals, that's one leg. Agreement on the means or methods that are going to be used, and the clinicians role. That's that middle leg. All held together by the client's or the consumers preferences. 

00:15:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:15:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Their preferences both in terms of what I would say are instrumental factors, like the client saying "I'd like to meet in the afternoon rather than the morning," "I'd like to meet with a male rather than a female counselor," and preferences that might be more about their identity, how do they want to be viewed and experienced by the, the helping professional, having a discussion with the therapist between the therapist and supervisor, if there's a group that can do this together with you. Even better, as you'll see in the clinical vignette, where they talk through the aspects of the alliance, and very often, this is when the lights go on for the therapist, and the therapist thinks that, ah, "Wow! I can't believe that I missed this piece, ah, something so fundamental to the work." 

00:16:20
JULIE TILSEN You know, as you're talking I'm, I'm imagining that perhaps, ah, every supervisor should have a stool. 

00:16:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:16:30
JULIE TILSEN Three legged stool that they sit on and they invite the therapist to sit on, uhm, to kind of bring that forward. 

00:16:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Process it. 

00:16:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:16:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, I think you'll see in the vignette, we actually draw the stool. 

00:16:40
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:16:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Ah, and have the clinician talk about these various elements, and then there are three or four group members in this vignette, and they start to ask questions which help us flesh out what is the client really saying; as you said, "Bringing the client's voice back into the process, putting it front and center." 

00:16:55
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Scott, why don't we go ahead and watch a vignette of a supervision group that you were running. 

00:17:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:17:05
JULIE TILSEN What do you need to tell us so that the viewer can step into this and understand what's going on and what to be looking for? 

00:17:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, first off, this is a teaching session, so it's not the same way it would be at your agency, but I think that the vignette you're about to see will be helpful to teach the process, and there is a group. Somebody has brought a graph and wants to discuss, ah, their work with a particular person that they feel worried about, and there are also three group members from that clinician's practice that are there to provide support, sort of, ah, to echo, uhm, as well as reflect what the, what they're, what they're hearing, and in this particular part of the vignette, there are, we'll cover the first two parts of this supervision model, and that is, number one, get that information out, and number two, let's take a look at the graph and see, so now you've presented the information. What does the client say, in terms of their progress, about what's been happening? 

00:18:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay. So it is an actual client of a therapist. 

00:18:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:18:15
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, the only difference is that it may be a little different because you're teaching supervision, not just doing the supervision. 

00:18:20
SCOTT D. MILLER That's exactly right. 

00:18:20
JULIE TILSEN Got it. 

00:18:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, so we've really kind of covered the basic FIT supervision model, and I would like to show you a bit of that in practice. Of course, I'm going to leave here, and you're gonna go back to your agencies. The idea is that you can do this same process back at your agencies, where you'll have one person lead the supervision, and you'll have your colleagues, ah, listen to you present the case or the material that you want to talk about, and then reflect on that material. The basic FIT supervision model includes about three parts. There's the first part where we get the basic information out about the person that you're working with. Second is the graph and the outcomes. What do they look like? Are we making progress or not? Is it less clear? Do we need to discuss that? And then the third piece is looking at the alliance that we have with the client. Can we help the therapist, ah, fill out and understand the alliance a little bit better or give some suggestions and ideas about how we might engage this client a little bit further, and Suzanne, you've agreed to volunteer to present a, a person that you're working with right now. 

00:19:30
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:19:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Ah, you guys are going to serve as, ah, the refle-- the person who, people who do the reflections. Does it make sense? So just to cut to the chase, then, that basic information, the idea is to get that information, ah, out on the table as uh, as quickly as possible. Sometimes, in the beginning when we're learning the model, ah, I bring an egg timer and I turn it over and I say "I got three minutes to talk about the person. If we were doing grand rounds in a hospital, we wouldn't be able to give a, ah, big dissertation about the people we were working with, so try and use the time efficiently. So, Suzanne - 

00:20:05
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:20:05
SCOTT D. MILLER - let's start with that basic information. Ah, and the first one is their first name. 

00:20:10
SUZANNE Ah, she's called Marie. 

00:20:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Marie. And how old is Marie? 

00:20:15
SUZANNE She's about, ah, say, 21. 

00:20:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So 21. 

00:20:20
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:20:20
SCOTT D. MILLER And, ah, gender identification? 

00:20:20
SUZANNE Oh, she's female. 

00:20:20
SCOTT D. MILLER And she identifies as female. 

00:20:25
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:20:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, great. And, uhm, tell us about her relationships. 

00:20:30
SUZANNE Well, she's single and, and lives by herself in an apartment. 

00:20:35
SCOTT D. MILLER So single, living by self. 

00:20:35
SUZANNE Ah, and she has a family. A mom and a sister and they have a-- they, they live quite far apart cuz she moved to a bigger city. 

00:20:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:20:45
SUZANNE Uhm, but she has regular contact with them on phone. 

00:20:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. So she actually does contact them. 

00:20:50
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:20:50
SCOTT D. MILLER The family is, ah, closer together. They're not estranged from one another? 

00:20:55
SUZANNE No, they're okay. Uhm, she wouldn't call them close but they're okay. 

00:20:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, all right. And let's see here. Then the current treatment. When did you start seeing her? 

00:21:00
SUZANNE It's about a year ago. 

00:21:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, so about a year ago. And, uhm, during that time, can you just describe a little bit about how you have seen her? 

00:21:15
SUZANNE Well, at the, at the beginning we saw each other quite intensively. 

00:21:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:21:15
SUZANNE Ah, about once a week. And, ah, then things got better and we saw each other less often. 

00:21:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:21:20
SUZANNE And there have been pauses, ah... 

00:21:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:21:25
SUZANNE Especially around summer holidays - 

00:21:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:21:25
SUZANNE - cuz she had to travel and she had to be with friends and she never really got back to me for a new time. 

00:21:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:21:35
SUZANNE So I thought that maybe we were done and then she contacted me again. 

00:21:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, so during this year-long period in which you've known her, then there have been some pauses. 

00:21:45
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:21:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Some, ah, sound like they're planned. 

00:21:45
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:21:45
SCOTT D. MILLER You've actually talked and said maybe we could stop here because you're on holidays. 

00:21:50
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:21:50
SCOTT D. MILLER You're feeling better? 

00:21:50
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:21:50
SCOTT D. MILLER And then, am I, am I also right that you're saying that there's been some unplanned? 

00:21:55
SUZANNE Yeah. I mean, she, she'd cancel a session and, and say I, I'll call you back and she didn't. 

00:22:00
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:22:00
SUZANNE And I, I haven't been good enough at following up with her, I think. 

00:22:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. And you've been seeing her now consistently for... 

00:22:10
SUZANNE I think about four, four or five sessions - 

00:22:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:22:15
SUZANNE - this time around. 

00:22:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So four to five sessions this time and it's been more, more consistent. 

00:22:20
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:22:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Has she had any prior treatments? 

00:22:20
SUZANNE Uhm, uhm, in her younger years she saw a school counselor just briefly - 

00:22:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:22:25
SUZANNE - when she was about 14 or 15. 

00:22:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. For the same issue we're concerned or... 

00:22:30
SUZANNE I mean, as you'd say that she never told to school counselor that she had an eating disorder problem - 

00:22:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:22:35
SUZANNE - but, but basically that was what was, uhm, troubling her but she never talked about it with the school counselor. 

00:22:40
SCOTT D. MILLER And would you say-- would she say that the reason for seeing you was because of her, - 

00:22:45
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:22:45
SCOTT D. MILLER - her eating? 

00:22:45
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:22:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. So the reason for the referral. 

00:22:50
SUZANNE Yeah. She's self-referred. 

00:22:50
SCOTT D. MILLER And she did come by her own? 

00:22:55
SUZANNE Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, and it's because of her, her eating. 

00:22:55
SUZANNE She would say bulimia. 

00:23:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. And she calls it that? 

00:23:00
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:23:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. And would she say that others are concerned about this as well or is it primarily her? 

00:23:05
SUZANNE Primarily her. She hasn't shared it with many people. 

00:23:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. And is there an abuse history, physical, sexual, or otherwise? 

00:23:15
SUZANNE No. 

00:23:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So none. 

00:23:15
SUZANNE None. 

00:23:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. And you've asked her this since she said it? 

00:23:15
SUZANNE Yeah, there, there's nothing. 

00:23:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:23:20
SUZANNE Uhm, you guys, is there anything from this basic picture that you want to ask about? 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN Ah, just maybe with the, the parental relationship or there may be no abuse and what is the quality of that for her? 

00:23:35
SUZANNE Well, she would say that they have an okay relationship. A bit distant, uhm, she-- they don't know she has an eating disorder although she's had it since she was 14. Yeah. 

00:23:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Did they get it? Okay. So it's a, it's a bit distance. As enough so that the family doesn't know that she has this particular issue. Does anybody know in her orbit about this other than you? 

00:23:55
SUZANNE Yeah, she has, uhm, one or two friends, ah, who've also had eating disorder problems or-- I, I've-- actually, I think they still have those problems and - 

00:24:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:24:05
SUZANNE - those three sort of get together and talk about it. 

00:24:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, so these two friends that are close also have - 

00:24:15
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:24:15
SCOTT D. MILLER - this particular eating concern or eating problems. 

00:24:15
SUZANNE And sometimes she said-- says it, it's maybe not a good idea to talk to them - 

00:24:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:24:20
SUZANNE - because the way they talk isn't healthy for them. 

00:24:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. How so? 

00:24:25
SUZANNE Gets into a kinda competition like, way of talking. Because they're all interested in losing weight. 

00:24:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:24:30
SUZANNE And, and then if somebody loses weight, she says that will make her binge or purge more cuz she's wanna also lose weight. So it's not... 

00:24:40
SCOTT D. MILLER So even she would say that these friends she has are not necessarily the best influence. 

00:24:45
SUZANNE At least, she would say that sometimes they're not. 

00:24:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:24:45
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:24:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Are these her only friends? 

00:24:50
SUZANNE She has people that she goes out, you know, to drink with. 

00:24:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
SUZANNE Uhm, and she has people that she goes to school with. 

00:24:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:24:55
SUZANNE But, uhm, they're not close friends. 

00:25:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Now, you mentioned-- I don't wanna make something out of this in case it, it isn't but you mentioned, ah, ah, drinking. 

00:25:05
SUZANNE Mm-hmm. 

00:25:05
SCOTT D. MILLER And I'm assuming were talking about alcohol here. 

00:25:10
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:25:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Is there an alcohol or drug issue or concern? 

00:25:10
SUZANNE No. 

00:25:10
SCOTT D. MILLER And so... 

00:25:10
SUZANNE She drinks like most, ah, of her peers drink. 

00:25:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. All right. So it's not outside the norm - 

00:25:15
SUZANNE No. 

00:25:20
SCOTT D. MILLER - for her kids her age and - 

00:25:20
SUZANNE No, no. 

00:25:20
SCOTT D. MILLER - and, and in the university. Okay, very good. 

00:25:20
LESLIE Then you said that she is, uhm, in school. Did she also work? 

00:25:25
SUZANNE Yeah, she has a part time job in, ah, in a restaurant. She's a server. 

00:25:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:25:30
SUZANNE And she says that sometimes that makes her not eat because all-- it's tough, it's a tough job to be a server. So you have long hours and, and no time to eat. And if she eats, it's food that she would consider unhealthy. She would binge and she'll purge. 

00:25:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:25:45
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:25:50
SCOTT D. MILLER This healthy thing has come up a couple of times. 

00:25:50
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:25:50
SCOTT D. MILLER That's interesting. 

00:25:50
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:25:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, one more thing you mentioned. Her relationship with her mom and her sister, uhm, where does her dad fit in? 

00:26:00
SUZANNE He's there, he's there as well. Ah, but, but no somebody she talks to at all, yeah. 

00:26:05
SCOTT D. MILLER So mom and dad are still together. 

00:26:05
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:26:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, but she would turn to her dad. 

00:26:10
SUZANNE No. 

00:26:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Can't talk, okay. 

00:26:10
SUZANNE Mm-hmm. 

00:26:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Anything else? Great questions. So we've gotten the basic information. This is the first thing you would do when you're doing the fit supervision approach. Just get the information out. Uhm, we don't need to go back to the client's entire history necessarily. Ah, information is going to be relevant to the consultation or supervision we're doing at this time. Can we take a look at the graph Suzanne? 

00:26:30
SUZANNE Yeah. Here it is. 

00:26:35
SCOTT D. MILLER And let's have each of us take a look here. So the initial entry score here was-- it looks like a 15. 

00:26:50
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:26:50
SCOTT D. MILLER But this would have been a year ago when you first started. 

00:26:50
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:26:50
SCOTT D. MILLER The last five visits, one, two, three, four, five. So she starts at about the same point - 

00:27:00
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:27:00
SCOTT D. MILLER - that she had started a year ago at a 15. 

00:27:05
SUZANNE Yes, yes. 

00:27:05
SCOTT D. MILLER In between, there have been, as everyone can see, a fair number of ups and downs. 

00:27:10
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:27:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Some in the, ah, green zone, some in the red zone, and you remember that, on these graphs, the, ah, green zone is where clients like this client would be scoring if they're going to end up like people who are eventually successful in care. Uhm, folks-- The scores down in the red zone are clients. Ah, if the scores are there, this is like clients who end the treatment more like people who are unsuccessful, and then there's this yellow zone in between the two, separating the two, and that is where clients score when it's indeterminate, we're not sure if they're gonna end up successful or not. As you all take a look at the graph, and um, let's look at it in some sort of chunks - 

00:27:55
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:27:55
SCOTT D. MILLER - that first, that first year's worth of visits. What strikes you about the graph? 

00:28:00
SUZANNE Me? 

00:28:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah, Suzanne. Why not? 

00:28:05
SUZANNE Well, it's, it's what, what-- This sort of mirrors my impression with her, that things have changed quite quickly, and then she's sort of not been able to maintain the changes. 

00:28:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. Would you all agree? And you can see these sort of rapid increases, and, typically, on a graph like this, when we such dramatic change, uhm, the likelihood of those changes being maintained. And it has nothing to do necessarily with you or with the client. It seems more like some external events might have happened and it's gonna be difficult to maintain those changes. 

00:28:40
SUZANNE Me-- she can give you descriptions of all the ups and down of what's happened in her life. 

00:28:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:28:45
SUZANNE And, and I agree that a lot of it is external things. 

00:28:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. And it probably feels like to her that life is out of control. A bit of, ah, a fair bit of the time. 

00:28:55
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:28:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Like if it's good, it's great. Enjoy it while it lasts. 

00:28:55
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:28:55
SCOTT D. MILLER And if it's bad, what can I do really, to improve it? 

00:29:00
SUZANNE And a lot, ah, I think, the external thing just to add one more thing to it... 

00:29:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Lovely. 

00:29:05
SUZANNE The external thing for her would also be the eating problem. 

00:29:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:29:10
SUZANNE So it hits her in different ways. 

00:29:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, that's interesting. 

00:29:10
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:29:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So one of the external things that she feels like she has little control over - 

00:29:15
SUZANNE Is the bulimia. 

00:29:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Is the, is, is this eating promise, bulimia piece. Okay, okay. And now let's look and focus more on these last five visits. One, two, three, four, five. You know, we start down around where we were in the beginning and tell us about her sort of mood at that first return back to you saying I wanna come back in. Tell us about how she was? 

00:29:40
SUZANNE She's desperate. 

00:29:40
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:29:45
SUZANNE Uhm, so she's, uhm, part of the story is that when she came to see me first, she was under weight. 

00:29:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:29:50
SUZANNE And, and, and in the process that we had together she gained weight - 

00:29:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:29:50
SUZANNE - and actually felt okay with it. 

00:29:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:29:55
SUZANNE She doesn't feel okay about it anymore. 

00:29:55
SCOTT D. MILLER That she has this act? 

00:30:00
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:30:00
SCOTT D. MILLER So she hasn't lost the weight again? 

00:30:00
SUZANNE She's normal weight now. 

00:30:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:30:00
SUZANNE Uhm, yeah, I would say wow, she would not say that. She would say, I'm now normal weight. I'm exactly as miserable as I was when I started so why on earth did I gain weight because I'd rather be thin - 

00:30:10
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:30:15
SUZANNE - and happy then fat and unhappy. 

00:30:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, all right. So what we, what we see here is that her mood goes up and down even though she has achieved what most people would consider a good clinical outcome for somebody with this particular diagnosis or problem. Her, her weight is normal but she still doesn't feel good. 

00:30:35
SUZANNE Now she's cutting. 

00:30:35
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:30:35
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:30:40
SCOTT D. MILLER And this is a new... 

00:30:40
SUZANNE This is a new thing. So before, she would starve herself. 

00:30:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:30:45
SUZANNE She doesn't do that anymore and she is not winning. 

00:30:45
SCOTT D. MILLER And is she concerned about that cutting? 

00:30:50
SUZANNE Only because it worries people around her. 

00:30:50
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. Her eating has concerned her and it sounds like her weight as well concerns her. 

00:30:55
SUZANNE Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. 

00:30:55
SCOTT D. MILLER But that the, the cutting concerns others like... 

00:31:00
SUZANNE Her parents. Ah, her mom caught her with a scar on her arm once. 

00:31:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:31:05
SUZANNE Uhm, she's done a bit of modelling for an agency. 

00:31:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:31:10
SUZANNE And, and they saw something that concerned them and, and so, so that's more that - 

00:31:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:31:15
SUZANNE - part that would be a problem for her. 

00:31:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So the fact that others are concerned has got her, ah, a-- a li-- somewhat upset. 

00:31:20
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:31:20
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:31:25
To facilitate learning, take a moment to reflect on the following before proceeding: (1) What is this person's goal? (2) What's the therapists role? (3) What are the person's preference? 

00:31:35
SCOTT D. MILLER And this new issue has emerged and we're down here again around, ah, 15. Once again, in the very next visit, we see this kind of jump up. She's back in her office. It feels nice to see you again. 

00:31:45
SUZANNE Hmm. 

00:31:50
SCOTT D. MILLER And yet... 

00:31:50
SUZANNE It's not helping. 

00:31:50
SCOTT D. MILLER It doesn't last. We're right back down over the next four visits. 

00:31:55
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:31:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:31:55
SUZANNE And I'm worried about her. This is why I'm bringing her up. I'm really troubled. 

00:32:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. Her last score - 

00:32:00
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:32:00
SCOTT D. MILLER - looks like it's right around a... 

00:32:05
SUZANNE About ten I think. 

00:32:05
SCOTT D. MILLER A ten. What did we talk about with regard to the ORS scores of this level? 

00:32:10
SUZANNE You said something about suicide. 

00:32:15
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. And so, not to be alarmist but anytime you see an ORS score of 12 or less, we wanna make sure that we've asked this question and assessed risk. So let me just ask bluntly. 

00:32:25
SUZANNE Yeah, but I did. 

00:32:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Good. 

00:32:25
SUZANNE Uhm, she says that she has suicidal thoughts - 

00:32:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:32:30
SUZANNE - but she would never do it. 

00:32:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. No plan. 

00:32:35
SUZANNE No. 

00:32:35
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. And no prior attempts. 

00:32:35
SUZANNE No. 

00:32:35
SCOTT D. MILLER And did you document this? 

00:32:40
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:32:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect! Then one of the things that FIT helps us do as we go through this process and review is make sure that our, our, our record-keeping is up to date. Does it make sense to everybody? And I know you're concerned about her. It sounds like others are concerned about her. Here she is, ah, after a lot of work, down around a score of ten. 

00:33:00
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:33:00
SCOTT D. MILLER What can we conclude in terms of the overall effectiveness of care at this point based just on the graph. 

00:33:05
SUZANNE It's not working. 

00:33:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Is there any doubt about that? 

00:33:10
JULIE TILSEN So Scott, I'm noticing that this has gone way longer than two minutes. So... 

00:33:15
SCOTT D. MILLER I was waiting for you to point that out. 

00:33:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay, not that I'm-- or anything but, ah, what's going on here? 

00:33:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, you know, this is a teaching. 

00:33:25
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:33:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Experience, as well as a supervision experience, and so I am taking longer. Of course, I guess I forgot my, my egg timer, ah, but even if I had, this would've taken longer. It's the first time people have really been exposed to that and they've seen it, and so I'm taking the time to introduce the material, and two minutes is something to shoot for. 

00:33:45
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:33:45
SCOTT D. MILLER People come in and eventually get the information. Uhm, that's gonna take some practice. 

00:33:50
JULIE TILSEN Well that strikes me that that fits very nicely with the whole idea of excellence and delivery practice. That that does take a while to learn anything. 

00:34:00
SCOTT D. MILLER It does. 

00:34:00
JULIE TILSEN And we do need to stretch things out, linger over them, and so whether it's the practice of feedback and form treatment or the supervision of it, we need to deliberate and intentional and take our time learning to do it. 

00:34:10
SCOTT D. MILLER And you know, with the teams we've been working with in doing the FIT supervision model, initially, they say "How can we leave out all the rest of this information?", but over time, after a year or two years, they'll say "I can't believe how much we used to talk - 

00:34:25
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:34:25
SCOTT D. MILLER - about information that ultimately didn't really help us resolve the supervision issue. 

00:34:30
JULIE TILSEN And again, the parallel between supervision and practice, I think when people first start doing feedback informed treatment and we ask them to do it or ask rather than a, you know, a small portfolio intake - 

00:34:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Right, right, right, right. 

00:34:45
JULIE TILSEN - questions, well, well, don't we need to know all that? 

00:34:50
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. That's right. 

00:34:50
JULIE TILSEN It's really, ah, a change in how we think about the work and what we need to do. 

00:34:55
SCOTT D. MILLER It is, it is. It does, it is a change, yeah. It is. 

00:34:55
JULIE TILSEN Scott, another question I have is what's up with asking the team to, essentially, vote to get a consensus on the status of this client's situation? 

00:35:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, and different teams do this a bit differently. Some of them actually do sort of thumbs up, thumbs to the side, thumbs down about whether or not the graph indicates that progress is being made. The idea is to infuse both, ah, ah, some fun into the activity. What do other people see when they look at the graph? The, the real reason for this, though, is that therapists are a terminally hopeful lot of individuals. They see clients changing even where no one else, even the client can see it happening, and I think that's their big heart. They really are hopeful, they really want to help people, and this is a way to provide some measure of support for the clinician embracing the client's voice, what might they actually be saying, and when four or five of the colleagues say "The client seems to be saying, from the graph, it's not working," it gets easier for the therapist to balance their hope with the reality of what the client's telling them. 

00:36:05
JULIE TILSEN So, just to be clear to under the thumbs up and down or the voting, it's not about clients. 

00:36:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Absolutely not. 

00:36:15
JULIE TILSEN It's actually w-- bringing back to the center what the client is saying their experience is with how things are going. 

00:36:20
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. That's, that's exactly right. 

00:36:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. So Scott, what's the next section we're going to be looking at. What's happening, what should people be paying attention to as they watch this next vid-- vignette? 

00:36:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Great. So what we've covered so far is getting that basic information out. The second piece was getting some consensus about what the client was telling us, vis-a-vis the measures about their progress, and now we're going to look at the alliance, what does the client tell us about that? What do they want from the therapist? What means would be consistent with their preferences? And what's our role in helping them achieve what they want? So that's where the discussion leads next. 

00:37:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Look at the SRS scores. What do they tell us? 

00:37:10
SUZANNE That she really-- that which again, reflects what she says. She feels that she has to come see me cuz I'm her only hope. Something like that. 

00:37:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Suzanne Wan Kenobe, right. You're her only hope. And in fact, the scores are quite high. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:37:25
SCOTT D. MILLER So we have low ORS scores, high SRS scores and quite frankly, when you see scores like this, low SR-- low RS, high SRS. Clients who are really struggling. It's going to be hard to get negative feedback from them. They're not gonna complain about the color of their life raft at this point. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN That's actually reversed earlier on because when she was doing really well, she was getting some lower SRS scores right there. 

00:37:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. And so she's saying how to find two and you can see the clients are willing to give feedback when they feel like they have a choice in the matter. But right now she's feeling like, I, I don't have a choice. I have to see. Which puts a lot of pressure. 

00:38:05
SUZANNE Yeah. I mean, I feel a bit choked. 

00:38:10
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:38:10
SUZANNE I'm not, I'm not quite sure what to do. 

00:38:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, let's talk about the alliance, and you remember the components of the alliance? We like to uh, think of it in terms of a three-legged stool, an analogy. The three foundational pieces of that alliance are agreed accou-, agreed-upon goals, meaning our purpose, agreed-upon means or methods, the therapist's role, vis-a-vis the client. Who are you? What are you supposed to do with them? Can we take some of these just piece by piece? Suzanne, and again, your job in this process is to absorb, be thinking about what are we missing in this picture, um, given the graph and what we're hearing from Suzanne and the kinds of questions I'm asking. Your role. Who are you? Now, you've said it in a way. 

00:38:55
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:38:55
SCOTT D. MILLER You are her... 

00:38:55
SUZANNE Well, I'm her only hope. 

00:38:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:39:00
SUZANNE I mean, I-- that's what I feel. 

00:39:00
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:39:00
SUZANNE That she's kinda grabbing on to me. 

00:39:00
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. So you were literally keeping her afloat. 

00:39:05
SUZANNE Yeah, it doesn't look like I'm doing a good job though. 

00:39:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, you know, she hasn't drowned yet. Right? 

00:39:15
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:39:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So you, you're feeling that she's thinking of you so is-- do you get any other ideas about what it is she is hoping from you, what she wanted from you? 

00:39:20
SUZANNE The, the problem is I have a history with her so I, I have idea about what used to work. 

00:39:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:39:25
SUZANNE And I, I actually, I used to be kind of guiding her towards what she needed to do. 

00:39:30
SCOTT D. MILLER You were, and with our-- I don't want to put words in your mouth. Are you saying you were more directive? 

00:39:35
SUZANNE Some, somewhat because I, I was the person to say to her that some of the things that you're feeling right now, like feeling depressed and having a hard time concentrating and, ah, staying awake has to do with you a little weight. You have to gain weight - 

00:39:50
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:39:50
SUZANNE - and you have to do it like this. 

00:39:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:39:55
SUZANNE And so, so I was kinda directive. 

00:39:55
SCOTT D. MILLER So you were more of a guide and you've been more directive and you were-- it sounds like you're making some connections as well for this is related to that. 

00:40:00
SUZANNE Yes, yes. 

00:40:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. All right. And other-- is there anymore about role? I'm sorry, I'm hopping ahead here. 

00:40:10
SUZANNE No. I, I, I think that is but, but see, the thing is I don't know what to do now - 

00:40:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:40:15
SUZANNE - cuz, cuz she's kind of telling me that the, ah, advice I gave her, she's kind of mad - 

00:40:20
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:40:20
SUZANNE - that she followed my advice. 

00:40:20
SCOTT D. MILLER And that advice was about putting on weight. 

00:40:20
SUZANNE Gaining, gaining weight. 

00:40:20
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:40:25
SUZANNE So I'm not sure that she wants me to do-- be directive anymore. 

00:40:25
SCOTT D. MILLER At least about this. 

00:40:25
SUZANNE Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, all right. Goals. 

00:40:30
JULIE TILSEN So Scott, as best as you can, if you can think back to when you were doing this supervision - 

00:40:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:40:40
JULIE TILSEN - and let us all inside your head now. 

00:40:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:40:40
JULIE TILSEN Help us be Scott Miller. What are you listening for, what are you trying to bring forward or make available to the therapist in the team that might be new for them to consider or to, uhm, to position themselves differently in order to move things in the different direction and be responsive - 

00:41:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:41:05
JULIE TILSEN - to what the client's asking for. 

00:41:05
SCOTT D. MILLER That's a great question, and first and foremost, let me say, again, that this is a teaching session, so I'm not only doing supervision, but I'm also trying to teach this particular group how to do this once they go home, so if this were a group that had, was already in the process, and I was leading it as a supervisor, I would first be encouraging much more interaction between the group members around the elements in the stool. What is it the client wants? In what way do they want it? What's my role consistent with what preferences of the client? And that's literally what's in my head: what is it that the client wants? Who is this person? How does this person want us to view them? And having the group members also ask some of those questions or reflect on what they're hearing the therapists say and how that might be different from what they understand the client might actually want? And so in this first piece-- and it's true not only in this, this articular consultation, but in many that I do that the goal that the client has-- and I'm always leery, as you know, to talk about goals; it sounds so linear. 

00:42:10
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:42:10
SCOTT D. MILLER So "one step after the other, so smart goal-like. That drives me crazy. What I'm looking for is, is what's delicious to the client? What are they hungry for? Ah, what do they, what do they want? And most of the time, I would say, there's a lack of clarity around that. Assumptions have been made about what the client wants, or, in fact, what is important to the client has changed. 

00:42:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Well, when you said a moment ago who are-- who is the client, I also think about who do they need us to be? Who... 

00:42:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:42:40
JULIE TILSEN Who do they need me to be? 

00:42:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Right, exactly. 

00:42:40
JULIE TILSEN In terms of, you know, who we are together in order to let the client step into going forward, yeah. 

00:42:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, in fact, you're truly giving me chills, because that's where much of this particular interview goes, that it's clear that the therapist has assumed a particular role, and, as you're going to see in the particular vignette, the client may not want the therapist in that particular role, or may want to have a slightly different role. That's that middle leg in the alliance. 

00:43:15
SCOTT D. MILLER What do you understand our goals to be? What did she want from your right now? 

00:43:15
SUZANNE That's, that's, that's a tough one actually. 

00:43:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Mm-hmm. 

00:43:20
SUZANNE Yeah. Cuz I'm not, I'm not sh-- she wants to feel better but that's not really-- I mean... 

00:43:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, that's a start. So she'd like to fell at-- and she said that? I'd like to feel better? 

00:43:30
SUZANNE Well she, she'd said it more, ah, the, the other way around. She'd say - 

00:43:35
SCOTT D. MILLER I don't wanna feel bad. 

00:43:35
SUZANNE - "I'm, I'm coming because I feel so bad." 

00:43:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:43:40
SUZANNE "You have to help me with this." 

00:43:40
SCOTT D. MILLER All right, all right. So, and then here's another role piece. You said you have to help me. 

00:43:45
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:43:45
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. So you, you have to help me. When was the last time you asked her about what exactly do you want? 

00:43:55
SUZANNE I asked her when she came back five sessions ago. 

00:43:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Mm-hmm. 

00:44:00
SUZANNE And, uhm, I mean, she was just in desperation, really. 

00:44:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:44:00
SUZANNE So she was like, ah, I'm cutting myself. I'm un-- unhappy about the way I look. I, ah, can't get out of bed, I can't attend school anymore. I have bulimic symptom-- symptoms that are all over the place and... 

00:44:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Mm-hmm. 

00:44:15
SUZANNE Uhm, and she was more like, help me. Yeah. 

00:44:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. All right. 

00:44:25
JULIE TILSEN So Scott, in this next section, uhm, you were clearly more facilitative than directive here. 

00:44:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:44:35
JULIE TILSEN You're, you're-- and I see the team getting a bit more involved and active. 

00:44:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:44:35
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, so a, a question that comes to mind for me is, is this "FIT" supervision or is this how Scott does supervision. Uhm, what's happening? How do you want people to understand that? 

00:44:50
SCOTT D. MILLER It, it, it's a great, it's a great question and, ah, it's both. It's both how I do it and it's an aspect of the FIT supervision approach which is to consider the alliance and get the team involved in having a discussion. What is it that the client wants, in what way to they want it? Consistent with what preferences and what's my role in the process. It could have gone in a very different direction, ah, as it was, it didn't. I might need to ask the person that I'm supervising whether or not I've met their goals or objectives much as the same way that I would do if I'm working with, ah, a consumer behavior health services. 

00:45:25
JULIE TILSEN Right. So, just as in the practice of feedback in a form of treatment, I think of-- as a therapist or I'm working with a therapist, who do I need to be for this client? Who do they need you to be - 

00:45:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. 

00:45:40
JULIE TILSEN - in supervision? Were needing to understand what does this therapist or what does this team need us to do? Who do they need us to be - 

00:45:45
SCOTT D. MILLER That's right. 

00:45:45
JULIE TILSEN - as a supervisor, uhm, you know, in terms of do they need more direction, do they need more facilitation? What are some of the ways that you use and what's available, uhm, as resources to help supervisors begin to integrate into their practice of supervision? 

00:46:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Mm-hmm. 

00:46:05
JULIE TILSEN Ah, seeking feedback from their therapists how to be the best supervisor for them. 

00:46:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Always checking in. Standard things, so asking "Am I getting this? Is this helpful to you? Do you have an idea now that you didn't have when you came in the room about how you might proceed?" And then more formal ways. We now have an evidence-based tool that's part of our packet of measures called The Last The Leads Alliance Supervision Scale, very simple, uh, in the same kind of fashion of the ORS and the SRS, a visual analog scale. You can give that to the supervisees, ask them to fill it out and have a discussion, so everything that is part of FIT practice can be brought into the supervision process. The same thing is true, for example, if there were a situation where I need to be immediate and directive, if there was an emergency, for example, if the client was at risk or in danger and I had to say "Time for discussion is over. Now we do this." 

00:47:00
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:47:00
SCOTT D. MILLER "Now, we take the steps we need to protect the client." 

00:47:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Let me talk about one last piece, and that's this uh, top part of the stool. You remember we call that preferences, and we understand preferences in two ways, ah, both preferences for age, ah, the type of therapist, the problem-solving style of the therapist, but also more in terms of identity. How does the client want to be viewed by others? What are your thoughts about that? And... 

00:47:30
SUZANNE There's, there's something about-- See, she's a beautiful woman, and, and she's also smart, and people often see her as that, but there's another side to her. 

00:47:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:47:40
SUZANNE She's a very sort of-- She's a very considerate type. She cares about the environment. She's, uhm, she thinks a lot about politics. 

00:47:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:47:50
SUZANNE And, and, and not many people see that because she has that long blonde hair, she's really beautiful but... 

00:47:55
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:47:55
SUZANNE And, and she likes that I know that about her. 

00:48:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Now, again, I don't wanna put words in your mouth but it sounds like sometimes, the way she looks and societal views of those kinds of things distract people from seeing just what a deep and caring, and thoughtful person she is. 

00:48:10
SUZANNE Yeah, and, and, and it fits with the eating disorder thing cuz that's also-- that's what we've been talking about. That's also focused on the outside thing but, but it sort of gets in the way of what she also is. 

00:48:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, which is... 

00:48:20
SUZANNE Well, this, this deeply committed political, politically active and, ah, considerate person. Caring about environmental issues and, and, and healthcare for everybody. And I mean, she just has a lot of other aspects to her. 

00:48:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. All right. Now, I don't want to, uhm, keep talking here. Ah, and, ah, I wanna stay away from the means right now because I'm not exactly sure you've been very upfront about it. That we're not sure exactly what we're working on at this point. So I'd like to just turn it to you three and ask if you have any reflections from the material that you've heard thus far. Ah, reflections about the role, about the goal, about this client's preferences. Anything that comes to mind. Thoughts. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN I know that a couple of things that, uhm, was brought up with the outline that I wonder how it fits with this picture. 

00:49:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Has to do with wanting to be-- her wanting to be healthy and - 

00:49:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Oh, right. 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN - her worrying about, like, caring about what others think. You know, especially with the cutting, she was less worried about whether or not people knew about her bulimia but not that this cutting seems to be much more external and, you know, it's leaving a mark that people are noticing. 

00:49:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN I'm wondering how that's fitting into, you know, the-- any goals or I think if there's been any conversation about if that has anything to do with developing some of the differences. 

00:49:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Great memory. So something about the healthy Ps and something about how others, ah, and concerned about how others view her that how does this fit in the goal picture. 

00:50:00
UNKNOWN And also had some, you know, how-- like I said, how that's like because they're noticing scars and cuts how this is leaving a mark for her future, you know, which is meant, you know, like she's modelling and now they're noticing and they're approaching her about it. 

00:50:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN You know, so questions are being asked. 

00:50:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Not with her... 

00:50:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, anything else? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Ah, what really struck me was that she is referring to this as an external thing and everything that I'm hearing is about an internal thing, uhm, so that's striking to me. Ah, I want to acknowledge that I think you were successful in that you were able to get her able to gain weight. 

00:50:40
SUZANNE Mm-hmm. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN So you've already got one success that you can build on. I'm concerned for you being isolated in the sense that you're kind of expressing that you felt a little suffocated because you're the only source of hope for her and then also I'm thinking is there some way that she could be connected to a broader network so that you're not her only support, because it sounds like her immediate friends are not supporting her. They're reinforcing that behavior. 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN And she's aware of that, too, which is another-- You know, she's aware that, sometimes, maintaining that friendship with those individuals are putting her in a position where it's really challenging what she wants to work towards versus what her body, you know, is what's, which, you know, what's going on in her head and what, you know, what she's struggling with. 

00:51:30
SCOTT D. MILLER So let me just summarize here. Uhm, as a means, this connection and network, ah, hooking up with people who are, uhm, who have, ah, a different focus than simply the eating focus, uhm, ah, et cetera. And then how that connects with her goals. Now, I, again, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but are you hinting at a goal here? Do you, are you getting a feeling about goals unexplored? 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN I think, yes. I think that-- again, I don't wanna put words in, in Maria's mouth - 

00:52:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN But I'm wondering whether or not these, this is the direction that maybe she's heading, in that, you know, she's a considerate individual who's committed to deeper, you know, deeper things other than just her physical appearance, and she's struggling with having somebody that she can associate with and relate with who also, you know, have similar goals and similar aspirations and similar drives and similar, you know, things to discuss other than something that people aren't necessarily looking upon favorably. 

00:52:40
SCOTT D. MILLER It does seem as if she is in, not only her current small orbit with her friends, but in a world in which certain kinds of values are dominant. The modeling world, it's all about how you look, ah, in some way. Okay. Nicely done. Leslie, I noticed you're nodding your head. 

00:53:00
LESLIE Well, I, well, I was gonna talk about goals a little bit, but what you said kind of brought another thing to mind, too, is that the energy that she's putting into, like, work, where it's around food, the modeling, where it's about beauty and the friends, uhm, and she seems to be putting the school, which could meet some of the things that she want people to recognize her for seems to be being pushed away and I'd be wondering about what that was about. Uhm, the goals thing-- I was kind of getting this sense, Suzanne, that, uhm, ah, she's feeling overwhelmed and doesn't know what she wants and that's how you're feeling when you're expressing, uhm, wanting to work with her and I was wondering about that piece of it. 

00:53:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN Just building on that, I'm wondering whether or not, in the past, because you have been able to provide guidance and direction, if she's, that is still what she wants from you. You know, in the past, it was very directed or focused on the bulimia and, you know, and how her mood would change for the positive if her weight, you know, had improved, and as you said, now, she's gained this weight. She's still healthy, but she still feels sad and she doesn't feel content, she doesn't feel happy, and so she's, you know, so the focus might have been off, but she's not knowing where to focus her attention now because, you know, she's done what she was told to do; she's done what she felt she needed to work towards, and she's still not happy, so I don't think it's necessarily that your role is not there anymore. I think it's really to redirect, you know, bring back to her what she's really worried about and what she needs to focus her attention on and how to, you know, guide her again in the direction, help her take the steps she needs to, to, you know, be happy. It's more about being happy and content with herself versus being at a healthy weight. 

00:54:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:54:55
LESLIE Yeah, you said that you stopped somewhat being the guiding directiveness because you thought she was mad at you, and it would be interesting to me, if I were in your role, to check that out, uhm, because maybe if she's feeling that overwhelmed, maybe she is wanting a little bit more directiveness from you. 

00:55:15
SCOTT D. MILLER I'm gonna stop you here just a minute, ah, just to check in. Uh, when we're doing this process of FIT supervision, I love it when the clinician just waits and listens to the reflections and takes them all in. Not everything's gonna fit perfectly, and if we get, and if we brainstorm in a traditional way, sometimes, a therapist will go "Ah!", and something will emerge. So at the same time, I wanna make sure the clinician, when they're getting the feedback, doesn't feel sort of, like, overwhelmed, like "Be quiet!" Ah, so Suzanne, as you listen to this, is there anything that stands out to you as you think "All right, uhm..." 

00:55:50
SUZANNE I, I, I do think the part about-- I could really resonate with the feeling of being very alone with her, and that, somehow-- I mean, I, I was thinking I need somebody to, to connect with me. I need a network of people, but probably, she feels the same way. 

00:56:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:05
SUZANNE I was just thinking that, that idea of-- and maybe connecting her to a network of people as a couple-- the, the team said that a network that has other values that match more what she really wants to spend her time with. 

00:56:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:20
SUZANNE Ah, because it's, it-- as I was listening to the team talk, it's interesting, the dilemma she's caught up in. 

00:56:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:30
SUZANNE Most her-- of her time is spent in what, I suppose she would also call unhealthy situations for her. 

00:56:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah, yeah. 

00:56:35
SUZANNE Food and modelling and friends that have bulimia and... 

00:56:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Mm-hmm. 

00:56:40
SUZANNE So, so I was-- that, that part I'd like to explore with her. 

00:56:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Mm-hmm. 

00:56:45
SUZANNE Because, I'm not sure she needs-- I me-- this might sound wrong but I'm not sure she needs a therapist. I'm-- I am thinking she needs a healthy network - 

00:56:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Sure. 

00:56:50
SUZANNE - of people to be with. 

00:56:55
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. Now, it-- I could be wrong about this but it also seems to me that the group is saying that maybe we need to shift our focus and it's not that we shouldn't be concerned if she begins to lose a lot of weight but maybe we need to focus - 

00:57:10
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:57:10
SCOTT D. MILLER - our attention more on this. 

00:57:10
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:57:10
SCOTT D. MILLER And if I can be so bold, is there anything that could-- would, would prevent you from being more direct about these things. 

00:57:20
SUZANNE No. I was thinking the same thing. That if I were to guide her, direct her that, that I should guide her in that direction instead. 

00:57:30
SCOTT D. MILLER And knowing her preferences - 

00:57:30
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:57:30
SCOTT D. MILLER - what role would you have to assume so that when you say, "You know, what? Here's what I think would be good for, for you to do as, as a, as a, as a guide." What role would you be and what preference would you have to? 

00:57:45
SUZANNE Well, she likes, she likes actually when we google stuff together. So, so what I could do is I could bring up my computer and we could-- yeah, exactly google some of these things. Would there be, ah, a place where she could meet with peers that feel the-- passionately about the same political items. 

00:58:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Political things. 

00:58:00
SUZANNE Ah, or, ah, would there be organizations that she could help out in or volunteer with her. Could she even get paid work, - 

00:58:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:58:10
SUZANNE - uhm, pursuing some of those ideas? 

00:58:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Now, I'm mindful of the time, and when we're doing this FIT supervision process, I usually wanna leave about 15 to 20 minutes to discuss one, one person, one, one episode of care, and so before we finish here. And this may seem a little abrupt. I'd just like to see your feedback, the four of you, about this whole process of FIT supervision, starting with a brief discussion looking at graph, tying it together with the alliance. Any comments, good, bad, indifferent about this process? 

00:58:45
LESLIE I found the process, um, to be very helpful, um, in a situation where I don't work with this type of client in the agency that I come from to feel as though I can help process through and give a different perspective, uhm, especially when it's set up. The preferences piece really helped to kind of, really, the client autonomy and what they're looking for. 

00:59:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. 

00:59:10
LESLIE Ah, I thought that was... 

00:59:15
SUZANNE I think it was more surprising to me how little I needed to tell. I mean, there's tons of information about - 

00:59:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Of course. 

00:59:20
SUZANNE - guys and boys and stuff - 

00:59:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:20
SUZANNE - that she's doing that I could've-- but I didn't need to tell them and it's... 

00:59:25
SCOTT D. MILLER And, and are you saying as well it doesn't seem like it's that important now given that-- great. 

00:59:25
SUZANNE And cuz it fits into the bigger picture so it, - 

00:59:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:59:30
SUZANNE - it wouldn't have added, it wouldn't have added new ideas. 

00:59:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:59:35
SUZANNE It would've just been more. 

00:59:35
LESLIE Well, it's remarkable to me that this process allows us like, you spoke about her with such admiration for - 

00:59:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:59:40
LESLIE - the commitment and all of those things and I think, uhm, in other types of case consults, that, ah, ah, people spend too much time focusing on what's wrong her. And I thought that was really cool and I hope that you can relay that message to her to do. 

00:59:55
SUZANNE Oh, thanks. 

00:59:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Cool. Thanks, Leslie. Anything else? 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN I think the diagram is powerful. It certainly helped me track what we were talking about. 

01:00:00
LESLIE Mm-hmm. 

01:00:00
UNKNOWN I felt like this is a really, really great learning opportunity for me to hear fellow peers talking about a case like this. 

01:00:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Hopefully, the process feels open so that everybody can participate without either lecturing or feeling criticized. Ah, one thing that I really-- drives me crazy as a supervisee is when, ah, when the following happens. Have you tried this? Have you tried this? Have you tried this? And then by, you know, within a few minutes I'm thinking I'm just gonna be quiet. So the process ends and often it FIT supervision that doesn't happen. Anything else? You, okay. 

01:00:30
UNKNOWN I liked how it organized all the information. 

01:00:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN It, it-- I mean it was, it was basically set up but it really did organize and put into focus what we need to look at and what we need to consider. 

01:00:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

01:00:45
UNKNOWN And, uhm, it allowed, you know, throughout the process, it allowed for this different opportunities for, you know, light bulbs to kind of go off and to make connections with pieces that you weren't considering to be a connection initially. 

01:01:00
SUZANNE Mm-hmm. 

01:01:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. All right. Well, I want to thank you all and let me just say one just brief warning. In the beginning, when you first learn this, it is really important to have a-- a, a leader. After a while, ah, when you become familiar with it, you can sit around the table and do this, ah, very quickly and you don't need somebody standing up here, drawing the pictures and such. Any other final comments? 

01:01:25
SUZANNE Oh, I, I got some helpful ideas. It's good. 

01:01:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. Thanks guys. 

01:01:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:01:30
JULIE TILSEN So Scott, in listening to this, it seems like Suzanne is leaving with something that she didn't come in to the supervision with that she's feeling energized about, uhm, has a new way to point their compass in the work. 

01:01:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

01:01:50
JULIE TILSEN That she feels like she's gonna bring her client and it might be helpful for them. 

01:01:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. And this is probably one of the more important parts of supervision in general. The therapist leave with a sense of hope. Ah, we know that that translates directly into more effective work. Uhm, and the process grows that organically. I'm not directing it to happen but by everyone talking, it, it ultimately happens. 

01:02:20
JULIE TILSEN Scott, I'm wondering, uhm, if you have a few questions that you would offer people who are starting to take up supervising FIT practice, questions for them to reflect on, to help them organize their supervision practice. 

01:02:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, the very first question I would ask is what would I want if I were in that supervisee's position? It sounds so basic, but I hear from many therapists who attend supervision sessions that they find it very frustrating when what they get in response to the presentation of, of their work is "Have you tried this? Have you tried that? Have you tried this? Have you tried that?" I know, for me personally, that sometimes I just shut up so that they'll stop talking, uhm, and I don't feel helped at the end of the process, so what is it that I would want if I were a supervisee, and of course, the first piece is I want to be heard and I want to be understood, I, I wa-- I'm stuck with this person, and yet, my heart and my instincts tell me to keep going. The second thing is, if the client were here, what would they want me to be be talking about, what would they want us to be doing, could the client sit in your supervision sessions and you not worry about that? If you're not worried about the client listening to everything that's taking place in that supervision discussion, then you're probably on the right track in many, in many ways, so how can I bring the client's experience and voice into the process a bit more, and if you want to have the client present, I'm all for that. That's usually a much more unnerving and radical step for people to take, but it's one that we've done for some time.
