00:01:00
KEVIN NADAL , Ph.D. Hi, my name is Dr. Kevin Nadal, I'm a counseling psychologist as well as an assistant professor of psychology at John Jay college of Criminal Justice in the City University of New York. Today we're going to be showing you a different type of training video. This video we created for the every day counselor and for the new counselor, the counselor that is just starting in her or his career as well as the counselor that might have to deal with certain types of scenarios that counselors or therapist 20 or 30 years ago didn't have to worry about it at all. As you watch these videos, I want you to think about what you would have done in these situations. Sometimes you might agree with some of the techniques or approaches that we may have used and sometimes you may completely disagree with what we had to offer and what we want you to do is to be able to think critically about what you would do yourself and to have discussions with your classmates and your peers on… on what you think would be the best approach. I often think back to my own life as a psychotherapist and a counselor and when I started 10 years ago and the different types of challenging situations that I would be in and sometimes I would leave a session and think to myself, did I do the right thing, what could I have done differently and sometimes I would even go to my supervisors and ask them if I did the right thing and they wouldn't know the answer either. So we've created these video that are based on real (inaudible ), real clients, real cases, real scenarios in hopes of providing you with an opportunity to think about what you would do in these situations. We're all different in our own ways as counselors, but what I do hope is that you at least think about what you would do in these different types of situations and so that it can help you in your profession as a counselor and the psychologist. Thank you very much and enjoy the video. 

00:02:45
Difficult Clients, Challenging Situations Scene 1: Passed Over For Promotion Visibly angry, Steve feels "passed over" with a promotion because he is a white male and that all the promotions are given to "minorities, women, and gays". 

00:03:05
KEVIN NADAL So Steve, tell me a little bit about what's been happening at work lately. 

00:03:10
STEVE Man, I… I hate my job. I mean, you know, I… I feel like everyone there is an idiot. You know, like I'm… I'm my bosses, they're just so stupid and I'm… I'm clearly smarter than them. I can… I can do anything at that job, you know, I… I can… can run that entire company. I think they know it and I think they're trying to keep me down and… and right you know it's… it's… it's time for promotions and obviously I deserve one. You know, I mean, I'm working real hard, I'm a smart guy, I deserve one and I'm probably… I'm probably the most deserving you know of a promotion there and you know, but… but of course, you know in new age, everyone's got a diversify right, you know, so… so of course they're giving them all the women, you know who… who aren't as qualified as me or really I mean even at any other men there, you know they're not as qualified but of course you know you got to… you got to see a woman up there on top, so they're giving them promotions or starting to… you know minorities you know all in the name of diversi(ph) even… even gays, it's incredible, I mean gay like that, now even they're getting special treatments because of this and… and here I am you know I'm just an average white guy and because I don't… I don't have these qualities you know, they… they… they assume that I… I don't need anything, so they're not going to help me out. So I don't… I don't get any recognition. It's… It's… It's just ridiculous and it makes me so angry and I just… I just don't know what to do, like just, you know what I… I just really don't know what to do, just makes me so angry. 

00:04:35
How would you respond to this client? Kevin offers a few responses. Let's look at the first one… 

00:04:45
KEVIN NADAL So Steve it sounds like you have a lot of feelings about everything that's been going on at work and you mentioned that you're feeling angry. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:04:55
What do you think about Kevin's response? Let's look at another one… 

00:05:05
KEVIN NADAL So Steve it sounds like you're really frustrated at work and it's sounds like you have a lot of feelings about not getting the promotion or the recognition that you… recognition that you deserve, but I think it's also important for us to explore some of these feelings that you have towards these groups. You know, you made a lot of powerful statements about women and gay people and minorities and… and I think that we should probably spend a little bit of time just explaining that right now for a second. Can you tell me a little bit more about your feelings towards these groups? 

00:05:40
What do you think about this response? Would you challenge Steve in the way Kevin did? Or would you respond differently? Scene 2: Difficult Decisions The client wants the counselor to make a difficult decision for her, rather than making it herself. 

00:06:15
JAYLEEN LEON So, hi I am Jayleen. 

00:06:15
KATIE Hi, I'm Katie. 

00:06:15
JAYLEEN LEON Hi, Katie. So what brings you here today? 

00:06:20
KATIE Uh… My relationship. I have a boyfriend, he's… he's really a good guy. 

00:06:25
JAYLEEN LEON Hmm… Hmm. 

00:06:25
KATIE I just, I was not in love with him to tell you the truth, but I don't want to end up an old maid either, I just, I really don't know what to do, I've… I've been back and forth. So I really wanted to come to you today. I mean, what do you think I should do? 

00:06:45
How would you handle this question? How large of a role can/should a counselor play in the client's decision? Let's look at Jayleen's first response… 

00:07:00
JAYLEEN LEON Well, it sounds like you want me to make a decision for you and that's something that I can't do. What we can do is discuss different alternatives so that you can come up with a decision on your own. 

00:07:10
Would you feel comfortable with this response? Let's look at another response, where Jayleen offers her sympathy to the client, looks at the issue from multiple perspectives, and shares an opinion. 

00:07:25
JAYLEEN LEON You know it sounds like a very tough decision. You know on the one hand if you leave him, you know you're worried about starting all over again and concerned about becoming an old maid and on the other hand you know you… you said you're not in love with him, and I wonder if you know you'll happy with someone that you're not in love with. The answer would be clear to me, but ultimately the decision is up to you. 

00:07:50
Do you think it was appropriate for Jayleen to say that the decision is "clear to her"? How would you respond? Scene 3: Client is Consistently Late to Sessions 

00:08:10
SAHRAN HAMIT Come in. 

00:08:15
DAVE Hey Doc. Sorry I'm late. 

00:08:15
SAHRAN HAMIT Hi. 

00:08:15
DAVE Traffic you know but any way, oh man this week we got to… we go to talk, there has been so much going on. 

00:08:20
SAHRAN HAMIT Yeah, I know, it seems like you know you have a lot that you want to talk about, but I just want to let you know because you are late, we only have about 20 minutes until my next session. So I just want to keep you remind of that and you can continue. 

00:08:30
DAVE Okay, yeah so. 

00:08:35
Do you think Dave got the hint here? Did Sahran make her concern clear enough to Dave? In the first scenario, Dave said it was "traffic" that made him late to the sessions. But sometimes it can be more than that. In this next response, Sahran checks in with Dave to see how he feels about working with her. 

00:09:00
SAHRAN HAMIT So Dave, you know you've been coming late a lot recently. I think this is about your fourth time and so I was just wondering if there are things that you know we should be discussing that are perhaps making you late you know besides traffic and everything or if there is anything that I could be doing as a counselor that may help you make… make it to the sessions on time. 

00:09:25
Sometimes it's just a time-management issue. In this response, Sahran asks specific questions about Dave's commute, and offers some solutions. 

00:09:30
SAHRAN HAMIT Okay. So Dave this is like your fourth time coming in late. Are you coming by bus or driving? 

00:09:35
DAVE I usually take the subway in. 

00:09:40
SAHRAN HAMIT And… And are you coming from work? 

00:09:40
DAVE Yeah. I come here straight from work. 

00:09:40
SAHRAN HAMIT Okay. Well, maybe we can take a look at your schedule and try to change the time, maybe perhaps make a little later, so that you can make the sessions on time. 

00:09:50
DAVE Okay yeah. I would like that. 

00:09:50
SAHRAN HAMIT Okay. 

00:09:55
What would your response be to a perpetually late client? Scene 4: Client makes racist remark in the middle of a session 

00:10:10
KATIE It's really difficult still for me to cope with my mother's illness. I mean, she is now bedridden and she's in the hospital and I had to see her sad every day. I still find it difficult to get up in the morning. 

00:10:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… Hmm… Yeah. So how… how you're feeling as you talk about this right now? 

00:10:30
KATIE It's terrible, I… I don't know. I don't know how to deal with it. 

00:10:35
KEVIN NADAL Okay. Well I know that you said that these past couple of days you've been going to the hospital a lot. Can you tell me a little bit more about what that experience has been like for you? 

00:10:45
KATIE I hate going there. I… I mean, you walk in and it's so cold and then I have to go into my mother's room and she's just in so much pain. 

00:10:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:55
KATIE And it just doesn't seem like she's getting a lot of help from… from the nurses there. I mean, she'll buzz them sometimes and it takes them 10 minutes to get in there to you know respond to her buzz. I mean, I just don't understand why it takes so long. It just isn't feel like they care about her and don't even get me started on their English. I mean, you know maybe if they learned English, they'd able to help her better and understand when she complaints about something. 

00:11:20
How would you respond to the client's racist remark? Do you think it needs to be addressed or should Kevin stay focused on the reason why she is in counseling? Let's take a look at a possible response… 

00:11:40
KEVIN NADAL Well Katie, I mean it sounds like you have a lot of feelings and it sounds it's really upsetting for you to have to go through all these things with your mom and… and I… and I hear that maybe you can have some feelings about the nurses who are probably of a different background and maybe that might be something important for us to explore in the future, but for now maybe it might be just you know important for us to just hash out some of these feelings a little bit more so we can really you know help you to… to cope in and grieve with what you're going through right now. 

00:12:15
What do you think of Kevin's response to the client's comment? Would you have confronted her with a little more conviction? Let's look at another approach… 

00:12:30
KEVIN NADAL So Susan, it sounds like you're going through a lot and you know I really just want to validate that it sounds really you know frustrating and sad and painful for you to be going through all this. But I do want to take a… a pause really quickly and just kind of explore that last statement that you made about the nurses and I'm assuming are immigrants who don't speak English very well and I guess I'm just having a little bit of reaction to that, because you know I'm… I am your counselor and I… I am a person of color and I come from an immigrant background. Do you think about how that statement might affect me as you talk about that? 

00:13:10
What do you think about Kevin moving away from the client's issue and shifting the focus to the racist remark? Let's look at another response with transference/counter-transference in mind… 

00:13:25
KEVIN NADAL So Susan it sounds like you're going through a lot and I… I can hear a lot of that pain and frustration and sadness that you're experiencing right now. But one thing that I notice is that we haven't really talked about our relationship. You know right now it just reminds me because right now you just mentioned something about the nurses and how they don't speak good English and… and maybe questioning their competence a little bit and we haven't talked about our relationship and you know you're white women, I'm person of color, I come from an immigrant background and I wonder if you question my competence at… at all. 

00:14:00
Which of Kevin's three responses would you feel most comfortable using? Or would you approach it differently? Scene 5: Non-Talkative/Anti-Social Client The client has been mandated to attend counseling, and does not want to be at this session. 

00:14:35
JAYLEEN LEON So Ryan, I see that you're mandated to be here. Can you tell me a little bit why are you here, why you have to be here? 

00:14:45
RYAN Its really not that important. 

00:14:45
JAYLEEN LEON Can you tell me a little bit? 

00:14:50
RYAN Actually I don't feel like talking. 

00:14:55
JAYLEEN LEON Well I want to talk about it. 

00:15:00
RYAN I got into a fight. 

00:15:05
JAYLEEN LEON Can you tell me, can we talk about a little about why you got into a fight. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:25
The client seems resistant to being in the session. How can Jayleen get him to open up? Let's look at another approach… 

00:15:40
JAYLEEN LEON So Ryan, we have 45 minutes, we have six more of these mandated sessions. We can either sit here and stare each other in silence or we can actually talk and make use of this time. 

00:15:55
[sil.] 

00:16:00
What do you think of this approach? Too confrontational or just what the client needed to hear? Let's see Jayleen take yet another approach. Here she chooses not to talk about the issues that bring the client to mandatory counseling, but rather asks questions about his interests/hobbies to establish rapport and connection. 

00:16:30
JAYLEEN LEON I'll tell you what, why don't we stop and not talk about the fight that you had and we'll talk about it during another session. How does that sound for you? 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:16:50
RYAN Alright. I guess that's okay. 

00:16:50
JAYLEEN LEON Okay. So I want to get to know you a little bit more. Are there any sports that you like to play, or activities that you like to do? 

00:17:05
RYAN Like baseball. 

00:17:10
JAYLEEN LEON Baseball. Do you have a favorite team? 

00:17:15
RYAN I mean, Yankees obviously. 

00:17:15
JAYLEEN LEON Yeah. (inaudible ) Bronx. 

00:17:20
RYAN Exactly. 

00:17:20
JAYLEEN LEON And do you actually play it, or you just like to watch it? 

00:17:25
RYAN A little bit of both. 

00:17:25
JAYLEEN LEON Yeah. 

00:17:25
RYAN Mostly watching lately, but when I was young I used to play. 

00:17:30
JAYLEEN LEON You used to play when you were younger? 

00:17:30
RYAN More so than yeah. 

00:17:35
JAYLEEN LEON Was there a certain position that you played? 

00:17:35
RYAN I like pitching. 

00:17:40
JAYLEEN LEON Pitching, oh that's good. How fast can you throw? 

00:17:40
RYAN I was pretty fast for my age at the time I could throw like… I don't know maybe 50 at the time or just… 

00:17:50
JAYLEEN LEON Wow! 

00:17:50
RYAN Different kid you know. 

00:17:50
JAYLEEN LEON Yeah. Really that's fast. 

00:17:50
RYAN Yeah. 

00:17:55
JAYLEEN LEON Okay. 

00:18:00
Out of all Jayleen's approaches, which one would you use? Scene 6: Client uses cell phone is session 

00:18:25
SAHRAN HAMIT So how are you doing today? 

00:18:25
JOHN I'm… I'm alright I guess. 

00:18:30
SAHRAN HAMIT Yeah. 

00:18:30
JOHN Just feel a little… I don't know a little anxious. 

00:18:35
SAHRAN HAMIT Well, how, well how come how do you feel like that? 

00:18:40
JOHN Basically this… this girl that I've been talking to she just… just kind of like disappeared on me in a way. I… I don't know what, alright she really didn't disappear on me, but I haven't heard from her a little bit and I felt like you know, so I'm just not sure. 

00:18:55
SAHRAN HAMIT Okay. So how did you meet here? Where? 

00:18:55
JOHN Well, I saw her in the street and just God she looked good so I went up to her and you know asked her out. 

00:19:05
SAHRAN HAMIT Okay. Where you got… would you do or go with her? 

00:19:10
JOHN I think, but I you know took her to get some pizza one time and then next time, I… I took her to like a play or something like that. She seemed to like it, but you know I… I can't really tell how she's feeling. 

00:19:25
SAHRAN HAMIT Hmm… Hmm. 

00:19:25
JOHN Yeah. So… 

00:19:30
SAHRAN HAMIT Okay. How do you feel about her? 

00:19:30
JOHN I like her, you know, but then I mean, I guess I have a tendency to… I have to get this. Hey man what up? Uh… yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I'm trying… I think so… maybe tonight. Okay yeah. Right, I don't know, I've been waiting to hear back from her, but I haven't heard back from her yet. Maybe I can get her to come out I think I don't know. Yeah. Alright. Okay, I tell you what, call me like, uh? No I never said that. Common what you're talking about? Yeah, alright so fair enough, fair enough. Umm… alright so tonight you are thinking around seven. Alright, it's… so far it looks okay to me, I think seven we should be fine, oh, let me check my calendar. 

00:20:45
What are your thoughts about clients taking calls during session? 

00:20:55
SAHRAN HAMIT Alright. So John, you know just before you've got the phone call, we were talking about this girl you just met. So you know, I just want to get back on track with that. So is there anything else about her? 

00:21:10
Sahran chooses a non-confrontational approach to addressing the cell phone use. Now watch as she becomes a little more direct while still maintaining sensitivity to the situation. 

00:21:25
SAHRAN HAMIT Well, John that phone call seem like it may have been important, but perhaps in the future we can try not to answer any calls when they come in and you know make sure that our phones are off, and in fact my phone is here and I can, I'll do the same, just so that… 

00:21:40
JOHN Alright. Yeah I'm sorry about that. 

00:21:45
SAHRAN HAMIT I have my full attention on this session. 

00:21:45
JOHN Okay. Okay. Yeah. 

00:21:50
In this third response, Sahran addresses the impact the cell phone has on the session. 

00:22:00
SAHRAN HAMIT So John that… that phone call it really took away from our session and you know what we're talking about and you spent some time on another subject. So, if in the future you could not answer your phone that'd great. 

00:22:10
JOHN Alright. I'm sorry about that. 

00:22:15
Which approach would you use? Scene 7: The nervous overtalker at her first counseling session. 

00:22:40
KEVIN NADAL So Tiffany, thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you here? 

00:22:45
TIFFANY I'm very stressed out. So I started by second semester of college and I'm taking all new courses and I'm also working full time. I don't know what to do myself, I don't know what kind of career I want to choose, I don't know what classes to take, so I spoke to my mom about it and my mom told me that I should take you know science courses, I can be a pharmacists in the future, but I don't want to be a pharmacist in the future and then my… I spoke to my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's about idea that I should be something else in life and then when I think about my friends they're all in different professions and so funny that you know one of my friends called over the weekend and she was like, oh, I'm getting married and you know get to save the day for this wedding because it's very important and I was like okay, you know I'll save that day for your wedding, and it's so funny my brother also called and he lives in California. He was like, oh, you should fly over the things, (inaudible ) you know we're going to have a lot of fun, it's going to be a family dinner and then you know my grandfather called, he was like oh my god, guess what happened, I'm met this really, really nice lady on the train and you really need to meet her you know you have to come over here and I feel I'm like being pulled to different… different directions and then I got this email from my professor last week. He told me that my paper was not good and I'm getting it after the semester and… and then I got lot of from work telling me that I… I missed some… paperwork and I don't know when I'm… I can do all these things. You know I… I don't have time and I have all these things. 

00:24:00
KEVIN NADAL Let me… Let me… Let me stop you right there, you have identified like so many different things and with your family and your friends and… and career and all sorts of things, maybe we could start by talking about just one thing at a time, so is there one topic that you want to talk about first? 

00:24:15
Kevin stops Tiffany and asks her to identify one of the topics to discuss. Do you think stopping Tiffany was appropriate? In this next scene, Kevin offers a psychoeducational perspective. 

00:24:30
KEVIN NADAL So Tiffany, let me stop you right now for a second and you know I hear a lot of things going on in your life and I… and I know you said that you're very stressed out about a lot of these things and I know that you had said in your intake that you… this is your first time in therapy. So, you know maybe I could tell you a little bit about what therapy is like, there is a chance for you to kind of ends(ph) about your problems which is what you've been doing, but maybe there is also an opportunity for… for me to jump in and ask you some questions to help direct you or guide you in a certain way, is… what would you prefer for at least today, is this… this a chance for you to event or would you also would like me to… to jump in and try to guide you into different directions? 

00:25:15
What do you think of these approaches? Could you come up with other ways to address the overtalker? Scene 8: In this scenario, the client is very excited to share his story, and in the process, touches Kevin several times. 

00:25:35
KEVIN NADAL So Sean, I'm glad that you're able to come back and to see me again. Can you tell me a little bit about how your past week went? 

00:25:40
SEAN It was really good. I met this great guy. 

00:25:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… Hmm. 

00:25:45
SEAN At his club Friday night, it was last Friday and basically you know we talked for like hours and we exchanged numbers and so I think we might go out again this weekend actually. 

00:26:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:26:00
SEAN And I'm really… I'm really excited about it. 

00:26:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Umm… So, who is this guy? Well, tell me a little bit about him. 

00:26:10
SEAN Well, he is in finance. He's pretty smart and he's really good looking. Yeah, he's like very fit, you know, but you know I don't know too much about him otherwise. You know I mean I just got to know him you know, so… 

00:26:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. I'm sorry. So you… you just got to know him. 

00:26:30
SEAN Yeah. You look you know that when you that feeling, when you're excited and it was like just getting you know, someone like. So I don't know. I guess I have to find him on facebook. 

00:26:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:26:45
Kevin is clearly uncomfortable and distracted by the touching. Is it enough for the client to pick up on? In this next response, Kevin addresses the situation right away. 

00:26:55
KEVIN NADAL So Sean, I'm glad you are able to come back this week. Can you tell me a little bit about how your past week was? 

00:27:00
SEAN I had a really good week. I met this guy at is club and he was just so cool, he was like really great and like super hot and we exchanged numbers and I think that we might go out on Friday sure. 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. So tell me about this guy. 

00:27:20
SEAN Well basically, I don't know he is in finance, he's really fit, you know so and he… he… I mean he seems pretty down to earth too, you know which is seems like, it's hard to find you know. So I don't know maybe I'm just you know going like a little crazy about it but like. 

00:27:40
KEVIN NADAL So Sean, let's stop for a second. I… I noticed that you're a real touchy person. You know, we're just getting to know each other, but maybe in… in therapy we can kind of keep our hands to ourselves. 

00:27:50
SEAN Okay. 

00:27:50
KEVIN NADAL It's okay for you? 

00:27:50
SEAN Yeah sorry, I just, I'm kind of very touchy, yeah. 

00:27:55
KEVIN NADAL Okay. So go ahead and tell me a little bit more. 

00:28:00
SEAN So yeah, but basically… 

00:28:05
What do you think of this direct approach? Now let's see Kevin show an indirect, non-verbal response. 

00:28:15
KEVIN NADAL So Sean, I'm glad that you're able to come back again. Can you tell me a little bit about how your past week went? 

00:28:20
SEAN It went really well. I met this guy, he seemed really cool, really hot. 

00:28:30
