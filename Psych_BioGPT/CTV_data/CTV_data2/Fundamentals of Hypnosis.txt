Fundamentals of Hypnosis Workshop 1-5 Brent Geary Ph.D. 

00:00:00
BRENT GEARY Good morning, everyone. Rather fractured. Let's try that again. Good morning, everyone. 

00:00:20
AUDIENCE Good Morning. 

00:00:25
BRENT GEARY See how easy that is? Welcome to the Fundamental Track that occurs within the Ericksonian Congress here. There are eight components to it. And, if you complete all of them, you will have a certificate attesting to a fundamental training in hypnosis. If any of you have any plans to become certified in hypnosis, if it's something that's desirable to you personally or if it's something that your employer would like for you to do, uh, if you need it for hospital privileges, something like that, these 20 hours will count toward the fundamental hours that you need for the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, which is the only bonified certification program in the United States. But, you do have to attend all of the, the sessions. And, I think we have a star studded lineup that will allow you to look forward to attending all the sessions rather than thinking it's drudgery and having to drag yourself from one to the next. My name is Brent Geary. I am the director of training at the Foundation here in Phoenix. I've been such since 1988. We have a lot to do and what I would like to do in the hour and a half this morning is about 30 minutes of talking with you about induction, 30 minutes during which I'll do a couple of demonstrations so you can see it done. And 30 minutes so that you can have a little bit of practice in hypnosis. We have tried to have a room that accommodates. In the past we haven't been able to do practice sessions. There may be some juggling that you'll have to do with the, uh, chairs in order to get as much privacy as you can when there are 110 or 120 people in the room. And, one of the things I always encourage people is that to become a skilled and competent and confident hypnotist, it's important for you to know what it's like from both sides. We're going to be talking about principles of induction that you do as an hypnotist, but one of the things that made Erickson so powerful in terms of his effectiveness in hypnosis was that he had done self hypnosis for many many years. And, he knew the possibilities, and he knew the potentialities and he knew the actualities of what happens within the hypnotic trance. And so, he spoke very confidently about what would be elicited with in hypnosis because he knew that it could be experienced. And, this is one of the things that made him so effective. So, when you're sitting in the practice sessions throughout the course of the track here, please also pay attention to what's happening within you. Everybody has probably done relaxation. Some of you to meditation. Some of you have done hypnosis. We all are in states of absorbed awareness doing different things, but the context of hypnosis is a little bit different. And, the more the familiarity that you gain with it, the better you will become. Now, inasmuch as you are surrounded by a lot of people and a lot of noise doing these practice sessions, these are not going to be the most profound trance experiences of your life, I hope. If they are, then I would suggest that you buy a ticket or drive up to Mendocino County, and there you'll find some of the most profound trance experiences on earth. With or without a medical marijuana card. So, so we are going to assume some things. We have to skip through the, the first phase of hypnosis which is the pre-hypnotic phase. You don't just have people come into your office and say, "Close your eyes." You of course do a, an assessment. In the handouts that are on the website, there is a paper that I wrote that will give you multitudinous different areas of assessment at which you could look. There are really too many there for you to keep track of a particular time. But, it gives you some of the ideas about things that you will assess that you want to talk with the patient about in order to plant it into the hypnosis that you do. I do want to talk about one particular dynamic that's very very important in hypnosis because if this is amiss, you should not proceed with hypnosis. And, it's the concept of expectancy. Expectancy in the last 10 or 15 years in the literature, both the experimental and the theoretical literature in hypnosis has really started to assume great ascendancy, and in some ways is starting to displace the old concept of hypnotize ability. The old idea used to be that you would test a person before you did hypnosis to see how much they could do. It's a little bit like giving a person a mathematics test, and then giving them mathematics test to see what they can solve in terms of problems. It was a little bit akilter, and what they found in, in a number of studies were that even if people believed in this concept of high, medium, low hypnotizable people, they didn't use the hypnotizability test in their practice. So, there's always been this chasm between the experimental and the, the clinical world anyway. People still talk about high, medium, low hypnotizable people, but now what people are more looking at is the expectancy for hypnosis that patients bring into the therapeutic context. And this is key. This is very very important. As a hypnotist, expectancy is your best friend. It's your biggest ally. We want expectancy. We want positive expectancy. But, it can also be your, your chief nemesis. It can also be your worst enemy. If people say, "I think this can help me. I know some people who have been in hypnosis. I've done a Google search on hypnosis. And, I think what it does is, is help people to explore different possibilities. I think there's a deeper part of myself that can help me with my problem. You are highly recommended by someone." And they have, they're saying these sorts of things that provide you with the idea that there's good impetus going into the hypnotic session, this is good. Also some of the questions you'll be asking questions about hypnosis. What do you think is going to happen when we do the hypnosis? What was your motivation for calling me? Have you ever been in hypnosis before or anything like it? Hypnosis is a state of focused awareness. This very simple definition is the one that Ericsson used time and time again. He would sometimes expand , broaden, add to the definition but his basic definition was hypnosis is a state of focused awareness. Now, people say that there are a lot of things that are states of focused awareness. And Erickson's response would've been, "That's right." He wanted people to understand that hypnosis is naturalistic. He was fighting against this idea about hypnosis that it's forced upon somebody, that it's done by these flashy stage hypnotists or it's done by these overpowering personalities that somehow get the person to go into trance deeply, deeply, deeply into trance. And, Ericsson wanted to know that it comes from within the person. That the hypnotist is facilitating it, and it's a cooperative venture, but it's just a state of focused awareness. And most anybody, who can pay attention for a little while, most anybody who can close their eyes and not fly off into psychotic process, can enjoy the benefits of hypnosis. Some of you are laughing. Is that diagnostic? Okay, well, if, if you're going to fly off into psychotic process, one of the other workshops might be better for you. We don't, we don't have an emergency team here available, so. So, uh, Erickson didn't ever believe in this concept of hypnotizability, but he was very big in expectancy. And Erickson filled the room metaphorically with expectancy when people came to see him. So, when people are talking positively about the expectancy, this is great. This is wonderful. This is facilitative. On the other hand, if you say, "What do you think is going to happen in hypnosis?", and the person says, "You're going to put me under." You have to stop them on that term. There's no putting under. Some people think hypnosis is like chemo-anesthesia where you're lying on the operative table, you look up and they say, "Count 100, 99..." and then everything goes dark. And you come back sometime later. It's not like that. There's no going under. You're going to put me under and you're going to program my subconscious so I don't. So, negatives aren't very good. I don't want cigarettes anymore. I don't want to eat chocolate anymore. I, I don't feel scared when I'm sitting on an airplane. I don't bite my fingernails. You have to do something instead, and there's no programming. There's no programming. The brain is often likened to a computer, but the brain is not programmable like a computer, particularly within hypnotic context. So, those sorts of expectations, characterological change, people want a different person. Just closing their eyes and coming back in 20 minutes. These things don't work, and if you can't get the person into the realm where their expectations are more realistic and they are attainable, it's something you can assess by the time the person comes back from hypnosis. We are going to do a hypnotic session here. What I would like you to do is to utilize the breathing to have a greater sense of your ability to control the level of muscle energy that you have in your body. How would that be? Okay, let's do that. You do the hypnosis. The person comes back. You say, "How was that?" And they say, "Marvelous. I was so relaxed." So, you got feedback about whether or not that hypnosis was successful right in the session. So, it has to be something you can measure, something you can quantify, something you can assess. Assessment is this ever churning, ever rolling, ever present process in hypnosis. From the moment a person calls you, from the moment the person walks in the room, from the moment the person starts to talk to you, you are assessing what you're going to do in the hypnosis. As the person is behaving in the hypnosis, you are assessing their response to it. Are they showing catalepsy. Are they showing muscle relaxation? Are they showing the changes in breathing, the differences in muscle tone? Are they showing their responses to the hypnosis that are characteristic of the state or the process. And when the person comes back from the hypnosis, assessment starts again. How was that? What are we going to do next time? And, it's this circular pattern of assessment. So, watch for expectancy. It's the most important variable in hypnosis. And, I can tell you this without any doubt and without any reservation whatsoever. If you have positive expectation, your prospects are greatly enhanced. If you have this unrealistic expectation, I want to change as a person, I don't ever want to think about chocolate again, I don't ever want to scream at my children, I don't ever want to lose my temper, before one word is out of your mouth you have failed. You are not going to be able to accomplish these types of goals. It would be nice if we could. I, I feel for everybody who comes in and they are desperate for these sort of things. But, you have to get it into something that's realistic, and here is how hypnosis can help you. Hypnosis does not eliminate. Hypnosis does not oblate. Hypnosis does not make you a different person. I wish I could do that, but here's what we can do, and I think hypnosis can be very helpful to you. The essential process of hypnosis is A-R-E. You are in the fundamental track of hypnosis."A" is absorb, and this is what you're doing if you are continuing and if you agreed to do the hypnosis with the patient. You are choosing how to absorb a person's awareness. Induction is a bad word, because induction really, the connotation most of the, the literal meaning of induction in modern-day English, if you go back to the original Latin, it's not quite as, as amiss. But, in modern-day English, induction means to force, compel, make somebody do something. It's this old idea that the hypnotist would put the subject into trance. And, this is an old idea. It's not accurate. It's not what happens. It's really not a very good word. Absorption is a much better word. And, what you're trying to do as the hypnotist is to help facilitate the absorption of a person from the outside world to the inside world. Now, in the best of all possible worlds we are trying to make this as seamless and as smooth a transition as we possibly can. It's never perfect. There are factors beyond your control. There might be noises in the hallway. There might be a plane that flies overhead. There might be something that happens within the person. They cough or they are nervous, and they start to giggle. Or, they get an itch and they have to scratch it. It's, it's never a perfect thing. But, this is the ideal, that we're taking the person from thinking about paying bills, picking up their children, the dispute they have with their boss, all the things that are happening out here, and we're trying to narrow their awareness to be here with us and to start this process of focusing. And if we can do this in as smooth the way as we can, then this helps to expedite what comes later after the induction. So, "A" is absorb. You have a lot of different things in which you can absorb a person's awareness. We're going to talk about two of them here today. Fortunately, there is a second component. It'll be the third component in the course. But, it's the second component on induction. Michael Yapko is going to come back and elaborate and talk to you about other aspects of induction. So, this isn't all you get fortunately, an hour and a half on hypnotic induction, which would really be way too small a, a apportionment of this aspect of the hypnotic process. So, we're going to spend today just talking about a couple of different induction techniques. You can absorb the person's awareness in a visual phenomenon. Were going to talk about the eye fixation technique. There's a very classic hypnotic form, hypnotic induction form, where you count. You count from ten down to one or five down to one or twenty down to one. It doesn't matter what number you use. But, it gives a person, particularly people who are experiencing hypnosis for the first time, it gives them this external measure of the pace of how people are going into trance. Most of the people with whom you do hypnosis are going to be experiencing it for the first time. People are scared. People are anxious. People are nervous. They may be curious. They may be expectant. They may be looking forward to it, but everybody has some things in the back of their mind about hypnosis that they need to dispel by experiencing it. You can, you can talk about hypnosis until you're blue in the face. I can give you a very rich description of the Grand Canyon, because I've been there many many times. You can go yes, oh it sounds good. You can even look at pictures. But, until you're there you haven't it experienced the Grand Canyon. So, I can tell you about hypnosis. I can tell you about hypnosis. I can tell you about hypnosis, and the person said, "Yes, that sounds very good.", But they haven't experienced hypnosis. So, what we're doing is allowing them to absorb in a comfortable way. And one of the things that the counting technique does is help people feel more comparable if they have any issues about control, if they have any issues about how fast this is going to go, these sorts of things. So, we're going to talk about those too. Michael will elaborate and talk about some other induction approaches. So, as the person is absorbing into hypnosis, you're going to notice a number of changes that occur. There are changes in breathing. It tends to move lower in the body. It tends to become more rhythmic, deeper. The person starts to achieve what we call catalepsy. The person doesn't move very much. Now, there are some people who will start to absorb into hypnosis, and that's it. They're basically unmoving for the next 15, 20, 25 minutes. Other people will move around a little bit if you're working with pain patients that have a bad back or something like this. Pain patients tend to move a lot. Anxious people will often move some. But, there is more catalepsy within hypnosis than there is in the waking state, so people tend to be more still. You will notice that there is a relaxation in the muscle tone. You most notice it in the face, but the shoulders might slump. You might notice that people seem to kind of sink down. Sometimes ahead will do something in terms of coming down or moving to the side. There are all sorts of changes that you can see. People don't swallow very much. They don't oriented to things. If there is a noise, they don't turn to it. They don't tend to startle if the telephone rings in your office or something like that. So, there are measurable transition markers that you will see from going from the outside to the inside. It takes three, four, five, six, seven minutes. It depends on the person. There's a whole range. If people have done things like meditate, other related sorts of activities, they're generally a bit faster and being able to absorb. People who were more anxious, people who have no experience, generally take a little bit longer to absorb into the hypnosis. But, as you're seeing the signs of the absorption, signs of responsiveness to what you're saying, then you "R", you ratify the changes. All organisms from single cell protozoa up to the higher functioning mammals like dolphins respond to reinforcements. And, if a person is in a strange situation, they are doing something about which they're not quite certain. They don't know exactly how to be a good hypnotic subject. But, you say take a nice easy breath, and the person breathes, and you say, "That's right." or you say, "Good." Or you say, "Excellent." Or you say "Just like that." Or you say, "that's fine." You reinforce what they do. Go back to your learning theory class. What do people do if you reinforce a behavior? They're more likely to cooperate with you again. So, even something simple like taking a nice easy breath, "That's right.", You ratify, you reinforce the response. And, your building up this, this cooperative sort of venture in which the person knows that they're doing it correctly, and they feel reassured and they start to relax some of the anxiety and some of the trepidation. Oh oh. Where is it? As the hypnotist, the ways in which we verbally can promote this absorption in as smooth a fashion as possible, is by this observation/suggestion. Observations/suggestion sort of pattern. Now, one good way of learning hypnosis is to say three observations and a suggestion. Three observations and the suggestion. That's how I learned many many years ago how to do the induction of hypnosis. An observation tends to be a truism. A truism as the name implies, is something that's true. And, so you say to the person, "You're sitting there. You hear the sound of my voice. You're breathing in and out. You can feel the support of the chair underneath you. Your feet are on the floor." These sorts of things. What happens internally when you hear that sort of statement? At some level, your saying yes. You are agreeing. And you'll have compulsive people that you'll say," You're sitting there." And they'll say, "Yes." And you say, "You don't have to respond. That's okay." So, they don't have to say outward. They can, you can just say yes inside. So, you're sitting there. And, it's very difficult to disagree with "You're sitting there." "You're breathing in and out. You hear the sound of my voice." So, what you're creating as people say yes to you is what we call this "yes set". The person has an attitude. The person has a responsiveness toward you that they are agreeing with you. And, then you provide a suggestion which is not necessarily true. You're starting to push experience a little bit. You're starting to guide experience a little bit. In hypnosis you don't force people to do things. You don't command people to do things. You don't get people to do things. What you can do is guide people's association, guide their behavior, hopefully in a therapeutic, relaxing, calming, comfortable direction. So, you say, "You're sitting there. And you hear the sound of my voice. And you feel your hands resting on your legs. And this allows you to let go in a nice easy way." So, you're sitting there. Yes. You're hearing the sound of my voice. Yes. You feel your hands resting on your legs. And, so what you build up is as momentum p op of positivity, this momentum of the yes, agreement. And so, if the suggestion is consistent with what the person wants, is consistent with their attitude, their conceptualization of hypnosis, what's the tendency? They already said yes three times, so they say yes again. And, when they are agreeing, if, if you'd just agree to you hear the sound of my voice, your feet, your feet are resting on the floor. You can feel the temperature. You're not going anywhere. You're just circling. But, when you agree with the suggestion, now you're going somewhere. Now I can let go a little bit more. Now I can feel a nice easy breath and how this allows me to feel more calm. Now I can go deeper and deeper relaxed. Now I can and so this attitude now is yes for the suggestions which we are starting to guide the experience a little bit. Now, one of the developmental stages of becoming a hypnotist is you have to hear yourself saying truisms. I don't know how many of you call a friend and say, "Let's meet at the coffee bar at two o'clock." They say, "Okay." You get down there and the friend comes and you say, "You're standing there. you can hear the sound of my voice. You notice the sunlight." If you do, you're not going to have friends for very, for very long. So, we don't use this in very many other contexts, and it sounds a little awkward. But, if you stick to the level of, of observation, if you stick to the level of truism, this expedites people's experience. The typical thing that happens when we practice these things in the beginning of a hypnosis workshop is that there is this verbal incontinence. I say practice just saying a simple observation. People go okay. So, you have the subject over there and you say, "You're sitting there. And, you feel the, the universe surrounding you, and the universal spirit permeates you inside so that you understand that you are" Just an observation. You are sitting there. You hear the sound of my voice. Your hands are resting on your legs. It sounds staccato. It sounds like verbalization interruptus. It sounds like it's incomplete, that there should be more, because as therapists most of us are used to droning on, whether that's good or bad. It's a vestige that comes from graduate school. The modeling that professors give us, pontificating and droning on themselves. And, you know how vicarious learning works. Sometimes are not even aware of it. So, we have to get used to the short simple phrases. Now, there are ways of making them smoother. The basic way is to put "and" in between the truisms. You're sitting there and your breathing in and out and you can hear the sound of my voice and this allows you to feel more and more comfortable. Not only does this add a little bit more of a flow to it, but it makes the observations seem like they lead logically to the suggestion, which is not necessarily true. It doesn't have to be logical. There's nothing really logical or necessary about feeling more comfortable just because your hands are resting on your legs. You can feel very nervous when your hands are resting on your legs at times. So, there's nothing logical about it, but it sounds like a flow. There's a second form called implied positive, and this is another very good way of learning hypnosis. The first way is to say like three visual observations, three and then a suggestion. Three auditory observations and then a suggestion. Three somatic observations and then a suggestion. That's a very good way of learning hypnosis. They're like trainer wheels when you're learning to ride a bicycle. You won't always do this. Ten years from now if you're using hypnosis, you won't be doing 3-1-3-1-3-1. It's just a way to learn. But, a second very good way to learn is by using what's called implied causative. And, the, the operative words are as, while, during, since. And, the first statement is an observation. The second statement is a suggestion. As you hear the sound of my voice. So, there's the truism. You hear the sound of my voice. You feel more comfortable. As you 'X', 'X' being the truism, you, you are, you can, you may, you might, you will 'Y'. And 'Y' is the suggestion. So, this provides a little bit more of then illusion that the observation and the suggestion are connected. Again, it doesn't have to be logical. You feel or, while you feel the temperature of the air on your skin, you can begin to wonder about a variety of things that will happen during this experience. Now,logically does feeling the temperature on your skin have anything to do with wondering about? No. No. But, it sounds like it doesn't it? It sounds like, okay yeah, I feel that temperature of the air my skin. Oh, okay well, I will feel more wonderment about what's going to happen. So, there's a little bit of an illusion. There's nothing wrong with that. We use a lot of illusions, a lot of different things in hypnosis to facilitate it. It's not tricky. It's not manipulative. A person is not going to be able to keep their eyes open and look at a spot for half an hour. So, one of the things were using with the eye fixation technique is the person going to want to close their eyes, which is something that we generally want in hypnosis. So, after a while the person closes their eyes. Good. We're working with the natural process. If you use a hypnotic induction, there's a hypnotic induction technique where you can have the person's arm up in the air. And, they look at their all arm and as they relax it comes back down. So, it goes down toward their leg. We're working with the force of gravity. People don't want to keep their arm up in the air for 20 minutes. So, it's all just helpful. It's all just facilitative. We're using imagination. We're using suggestion. We're using motivation. We're using a lot of different dynamics within hypnosis, and always remembering that at its essence, hypnosis is a persuasion communication. Were trying to persuade people to do things ostensibly that are good for them, ostensibly that will help them with whatever the issue is that they brought to us. So, one of the ways that we do this is to create these little illusions that truisms, observations are connected to suggestions so that people are more willing. People find it more facilitative to follow the suggestions, which allow us to guide people's awareness, guide people's consciousness, guide people's attention in certain ways so that they absorb into hypnosis. And then we can utilize the hypnosis for therapeutic purposes. Okay. Any questions about anything I just babbled about? Oh, the "E" is elicit, and that's going to be the rest of the track. "A" is absorb. That's what you're doing in the, in the induction. "R" is ratify. Ratify or reinforce, however you want to look at it. In hypnosis, you generally talk about ratification. Erickson's favorite ratification was, "That's right." If you watch his videos, if you listen to his audios, if you read the transcripts, Erickson said, "That's right. That's right." a lot. It seems like sometimes he did it for a particular response. Every once in a while Erickson seem to just kind of throw it into pond, so to speak. And to say, "That's right.", And, you know, if you were really looking for why was he saying that, it would be difficult to identify. He just wanted people to be reassured, people to know that they were doing things right. You don't have to say that's right. That's one of them. You can say if you're from Italy of course, you say, "Moto Bene". If you're from Columbia, you say, "Mui Bien". You can say, "Good. Excellent. Perfect." Anything that allows the person to hear it and say, "What I'm doing is good. I feel like cooperating more. And I feel reassured that I'm being a good hypnotic subject." This is what people want to know. This is what people want to experience. And then as you move into the hypnosis, which is, we're stopping with the induction, but you'll have a lot of discussion the rest of the other components of this fundamental track, then you start to elicit. You start to elicit responsiveness from the person. You start to elicit resources that the person has that you can utilize and with which you can work, largely unconscious processes. The reason that we're doing hypnosis is that it is a context that allows you greater access to unconscious resources. So, absorb, ratify, elicit. All right. If someone would like to come up and volunteer for what promises to be one of the least profound experiences of your entire life, then I will do a demonstration of our first form of induction. This is the one I learned. When I was about four years old, my father would come home from these mysterious weekends. I never knew where he was. And, he would come in and take me into the living room and, he'd say, "Sit there in that chair and look up at the ceiling." And we had one of those feelings were they spray it. I think they called popcorn or something like that. I can't remember what they call it And so, I would decide, and I would look at a spot. And he'd say, "As you look at that spot..." And he'd start to talk to me in these weird ways. And I later heard, later discovered that he was going to hypnosis workshops by Milton Erickson. He was going to Portland. He was going to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, all over the Western United States. We lived in, in Oregon. And so, the eye fixation technique was the one that I learned experientially. And, it's a wonderful technique because it allows people to have some control. You're also working with something though that the person is going to want to close their eyes eventually. And, later you'll discover that it's also one of the best hypnotic induction extant to set up therapy that you're going to do later in the hypnosis, particularly therapy with, with traumatic sorts of issues, anything you're going to do with visualization, with anxiety patients, with pain patients. And so, it's a very good technique to learn and to, to know and to have available to you. It's not a matter that the old traditional model people used to just memorize a few inductions. And, you do the coin drop induction, where the person would relax. The coin, you would hear it, you would go deep inside. The eye roll induction, the pale in the book. So, you would just memorize like three or four of these and then everybody who would walk in would get one or the others. It doesn't have anything to do with depression. It doesn't have anything to do with pain, but the old idea was you're just kind of passing some time while the person going from the waking state into the hypnotic state. That's not how Ericksonians think. We're constantly looking ahead and as you gain greater familiarity and facility with hypnosis, you'll start to see that you can actually prime, you can seed things in the induction that you're going to come back to in the hypnosis. It's a little bit like the literary technique or the technique that's used in, in movies where there's foreshadowing. They're something that happens earlier in the movie, and when it comes back to it, there's even more of a dramatic impact. And you can start to do this with hypnosis. Jeff might talk to. He's big into it. I think one of the workshops he's doing at the Congress here is about adding drama to hypnosis. And, one of the things you can do is, is start to build momentum, and start to build therapeutic responsiveness right within the induction itself. It's not just a passage of time. It's not just something that you're waiting for the person to go into hypnosis, and you checking stock quotes while they're doing it. So, it's part of therapy, and we all know that time is precious with the time, the opportunity that we have with patients in our office. So, you might as well use every moment. And so, the eye fixation technique is a wonderful technique, and it's not one that everybody who comes into your office, you'll use. But, you will use it quite often I think. So, if somebody wants to come up, all you have to do is sign a form that says that you agree to sign over your 401(k) plan to the Milton Erickson Foundation and some simple things. No, she's intercepting you for the form.

BRENT GEARY Is there a particular bank or brokerage house that we should contact to make the arrangements? No? Oh, okay. I think it goes around your ear. I've been told. Let's just test it. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Hello? 

00:35:45
BRENT GEARY Can we hear you? 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN I think we do. 

00:35:50
BRENT GEARY Okay, perfect. Have you experienced hypnosis ever before? 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:35:55
BRENT GEARY Do you meditate or lie in a hot tub, or are you from Mendocino County or anything like that? 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:36:00
BRENT GEARY Which of the things do you like to do? 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Uh, relaxation. relaxation. 

00:36:05
BRENT GEARY And you just do it yourself or do you do it? 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN I have Jacobson and Schultz(ph). 

00:36:10
BRENT GEARY Okay, great. So, you're well ahead of the game. You knows what it feels like to, to relax and absorb. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN I, I've never relaxed in front of so many people though, but. 

00:36:20
BRENT GEARY Most people haven't. We're not going to have your dance or anything though. Do you prefer to quack like a duck or bark like a dog. Do you have a preference of those two or? 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN Quack. 

00:36:35
BRENT GEARY Quack. Okay. 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN Quack quack. 

00:36:35
BRENT GEARY No, all you're going to do is sit here. This is really going to be pretty brief, because what we are just, what were just demonstrating is the induction part of this. So, we're not going to do anything with it. We're not going to reveal any secrets. You're not going to start talking in an uncontrolled manner or anything like that. So, all right? Find a spot over there somewhere. Don't look into light, but find a spot that you can look at. And, just keep your eyes fixed on that spot. And start by taking one or two or three nice refreshing breaths. Breaths that you know are good for you through the experience that you have with the relaxation. Excellent. Just like that. And as you look at that spot, you can start to let go of any muscle tension that you're not going to need for the next several minutes here. Your blink rate is increased a little bit. You can keep your eyes open for just a little while longer and look at that spot. You feel your hands resting. You can make any movements that add to your comfort anytime along here. You feel the support of the chair beneath you, and you hear the sound of my voice, and these things allow you to find a particular focus that can be helpful for you because just a few minutes ago you were doing different things in different activities. And even now, with focusing and looking at that spot there will be different things that you hear in the room. You feel the rise and the fall of your body as you breathe. And, you're looking forward to the time when you'll decide when you can close your eyes and just allow them to remain closed. Whenever that time is best for you. And just enjoy the real nice soothing sensation of your eyelids on your eyes right now. And, notice how the elimination of that visual stimulation allows you to just settle in to the process more and more. And still being able, with your eyes closed, to hear the sound of my voice. You can also pay attention to anything that you're saying to yourself inside. And, also any sorts of sounds that remind you that while you're relaxing you still maintain a natural protective contact with the external environment. And as those things occur just feel the comfort coming into your body. And how that process happens for you. Some people seem to feel a nice lightness as they relax, almost as if they're starting to drift. Other people feel a very comfortable heaviness. Almost as if you're sinking down into the chair. But what we know is that this relaxation is familiar to you. And, so it's good that you can so easily and so quickly summon these nice feelings for yourself to enjoy. You've really done a marvelous job of allowing your mind and your body to work together to accomplish all the changes that have occurred in such a relatively short period of time. Notice the changes in the muscle tone, your face, your shoulders, you're back, torso, all the way down to your feet. You notice how your breathing is altered, nice gentle rhythm that supports the experience. Maybe you notice differences in the way that you're processing information. This seems to be more of an easy drifting flow to the mind when you're relaxing like this and letting go. And you provide yourself with this context in which you can just allow things to happen. You could allow yourself to hear. You can allow yourself to feel. You can allow yourself to notice any sort of changes, even with your eyes closed that might happen in your visual processing. You don't have to do anything right now. Nothing that you need to strain or plan to do. You can just allow your experience to flow and to occur and to pay attention to what's most interesting and what's most helpful for you and your purposes in coming up here to experience this process and experience the possibilities that can occur in this cooperative sort of relationship that you have with your mind and your body and your motivations and intentions and giving yourself another chance to learn and to expand your awareness and your knowledge. Some people even start to look ahead. They use the opportunity, the flexibility and time and space that hypnosis affords to begin think about ways in your own future that you might utilize this, either for yourself or for other people with whom you work, other people who would enjoy and benefit from this type of process. So, take just a moment, just 20 or 30 seconds of clock time, in the privacy of your own experience to allow yourself to integrate whatever it is that's happened during this time that you spent with yourself and you spent with me. Feel very good about the learning that you've afforded other people here to have by observing and listening and at the end of those 20 or 30 seconds I'll start to talk to you again. But just take some time on your own right now. 

00:43:55
[sil.] 

00:43:55
BRENT GEARY Now, you probably already know that there is a natural sort of way that you accomplish coming back from a relaxed state. You don't have to do it too fast. You don't have to do it too slow. And with all of your experience, I'm going to trust you to set just the right pace for coming back for yourself. So, that you start to allow your awareness to reach back out into the environment. You allow the energy to nice and easily come back into your body so you feel your legs, your body, even the little muscles in your face starting to, so to speak,, live again. After a while, you'll know that movements are possible. Maybe swallow or move your hands or your feet. And, when the time is right, you can take another of those one or two or three nice easy refreshing breaths and you can open your eyes. Come back with a feeling of refreshment, and don't be too startled when you come back that there is no light in the room. Are your eyes open? 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:45:35
BRENT GEARY Okay. Somewhere along the way, we lost the light in here. Did you feel that happened? Did you sense it? 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Yes. Yes, I did. 

00:45:40
BRENT GEARY Okay. Yeah, we don't know what... 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN There, there was no light in my eyes. 

00:45:45
BRENT GEARY Yeah, yeah. We don't know what the situation is, but we can still talk and they could still hear us out there. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN Okay. It's much more comfortable like that, you know? 

00:45:55
BRENT GEARY You'll have to arrange that in your office. So, anything that you would like to say about your experience? 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN I noticed my eyes were fidgeting, like tic tic tic tic tic, and then it started more and more to stop once I was getting deeper in that. But, at first. 

00:46:20
BRENT GEARY Now, they were fidgeting while your eyes were open or even a few close them? 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Even after I closed them for a little while, and it was disturbing for me. Yeah, I think it's part of like... 

00:46:35
BRENT Absorbing? 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Absorbing, yeah. 

00:46:35
BRENT GEARY Once the, the eye fidgeting settled down? 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN Uh, When the light went off, then I noticed fidgeting again in my eyes, uh, for a little while, and then got deeper. I, I, yeah. 

00:46:55
BRENT GEARY So, overall a fairly comfortable experience for you? 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Given the context, yes. 

00:47:00
BRENT GEARY Yeah, and I think that's the context is a lot of it. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN The voice was very calming also, very reassuring. The tone, the rhythm. 

00:47:10
BRENT GEARY So, that part was okay for you? 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. Great, well thank you so much for helping me. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:47:15
BRENT GEARY Watch your step. Don't, don't, don't go down yet. Okay. You see where they are there? 

00:47:30
[sil.] 

00:47:30
BRENT GEARY I wonder if this affects the webcast at all? Okay, so, uh, despite the distractions, there is a classic recording. Erickson's doing hypnosis with someone. It's on an, an audiotape, and I think he's about 10 or 12 minutes into the, the hypnosis. And, Erickson smoked cigarettes. You know, back in the 1950s there were actually thought to be healthy. They were Camel cigarette commercials that talked about, you know, being healthier by smoking these Camel cigarettes. And, Erickson's doing the hypnosis and all the sudden and he goes on for about 20 or 30 seconds. And then he kind of says, "You can ignore any distractions." So, you too and ignore any distractions that are happening here today. So, uh, what I would like you to do is kind of turn to the person next to you or, you can spread chairs out a little bit to try to create as much space. There is some, some room in the back. You can kind of push back. Just take about five or six minutes. You're not going to do this perfectly, but ask your subject to find a space. Don't look into light. Something up on the wall or something like that. And, start to do this observation/suggestion and truism. Well, the best laid plans. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:20
BRENT GEARY And, so what you do is the observations and suggestions, the, you talk. Eyes will close at some point. You ratify that. Excellent. You can feel nice and comfortable, and then the person will come back. We're only doing a brief little induction here for the eye fixation. Get some feedback from your subject, switch roles. 15 minutes maximum. 15 minutes. Now, you can keep, keep your chairs about how they are. Just turn them so you look back up at the front, but will do one more practice session. These are not ideal circumstances, so please don't start to complain. And, having been in the field for a long time and knowing the capabilities for boundary maintenance among people in the mental health field, I'm not going to say how did that go. So, we'll assume that it went fine. But, these are, these are extenuating circumstances. I understand, but what I want you to do is just to get some familiarity with talking in the way that a hypnotist talks in induction. So, now I would like to demonstrate the second technique to you. So, if someone would volunteer to come up. This is a very good technique that you can go do with the person the first time. You're not limited to that. Other people you can do with the tenth time you do hypnosis. But, it's a very good technique because a lot of what people are fearful about an hypnosis is going too fast. They're closing their eyes and then jumping down into this abyss that they don't know where they're going and what's going to happen. So, you can discuss with the person before hand and say, "I'm just going to count from ten down to one. And as I do, you will be able to know the rate at which we're going into hypnosis. It doesn't matter if you relax a little bit faster and you're a little ahead of the numbers. It doesn't matter if you are doing it more gradually and you're a little bit behind the numbers. That doesn't make any difference. The ten down to one just gives you an indication of the pace at which we're going to proceed." And, it helps people to be assured in that way and to have a sense of the pace at which the hypnosis is going. Hi. And other than five minutes ago, have you had any experience with hypnosis? And, what's the type of experience that you've had? 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN Well, my supervisor is Dr. Fleming, Douglas Fleming. So, I work with him, and I've taken classes, courses. 

00:52:15
BRENT GEARY Oh, great. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN And, practice here and there. 

00:52:15
BRENT GEARY Okay, so, have you practiced the counting technique before? 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN Not necessarily counting, no. 

00:52:25
BRENT GEARY Okay, well why don't you get in a nice comfortable position. And, do you just want to start with your eyes closed. Do you want to close your eyes from the beginning? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Okay, sure. 

00:52:35
BRENT GEARY Now, what I'm going to do is just count from ten gradually down to one. And you can just feel yourself absorbing. And again, if you go a little bit faster, don't worry about it. If you're lagging behind a little bit, we all know where we're going. We're just going down to one. Okay? Take a nice easy breath and close your eyes. And just feel the way in which you can start to settle into the experience . At ten, still aware of sounds that are happening in the room. And you can make any adjustments that add to your comfort if you wish. And focus on the rhythm of your breathing. And at nine, you'll be able to experience how that breathing modifies as you focus and relax. Eight, feeling more and more comfortable. And probably these are familiar feelings to you since you've had these types of experiences before. You feel your hands resting on your legs, and your feet are on the floor. And, the support of the chair beneath you and behind you. And these things allow you to feel nice and secure so that at seven, you can absorb more and more in an easy comfortable way. And six, again sometimes aware of sounds that pass through your consciousness. Five, halfway down now. Halfway relaxed. There's not really any particular way of quantifying that, but maybe you have noticed the changes that have been occurring. The way that the muscles in your shoulders have let go. So, the shoulders are a little bit lower than they were before. The warmth that's developed where your hands are resting on your legs. And four, these changes that are occurring all reminding you and all indicating to you that what you're doing here is accomplishing a tremendous amount of change in a short period of time. Three, noticing that easy rhythm of your breathing and as you inhale you can really focus on what it feels like to bring that air in. And then exhale, and feel the balance in that rhythm of breathing. Two, almost all the way relaxed now to the extent, to the level that it's appropriate for you here today to experience that relaxation and absorption and at one, noticing the end of that process of counting, and being able and having the opportunity to notice other things as well. How that relaxation, how that comfort feels within your body. How you utilize this for yourself in the past. Ways in which this can be valuable for you in the future. This capacity that hypnosis affords you, just noticing and being interested in whatever it is that's right for you at a particular moment. You can feel very good about the motivation for coming up here and helping me, and helping other people to learn in these early stages of their development as hypnotic therapists. That says something very nice about you. So, however it is that you would like to, hold on to that awareness of the good motivation and the kind extension of yourself that you've demonstrated here today. That will come back with you as I gradually now count back up from one to ten. And as I do, with the numbers you'll feel yourself coming back nice and gradually, not too fast, not too slow. And, at one just starting to orient to the process of returning. Two, three. That's good. Some movement. Starting to feel the energy coming back into your body. Four, five, as your mind starts to reach back out into the environment. Maybe, noticing some things you hadn't noticed for a while there. The temperature there on your skin for instance. Six, seven, and other places in your body can move. You can start to flex your fingers a little bit or move your feet. Eight, nine, then we can take a couple of nice refreshing breaths. And at ten, open your eyes, come back feeling refreshed, alert, awake, looking forward to what's going to happen in the rest of the day for you. So, how was that? 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN I didn't want to come back. 

00:58:15
BRENT GEARY That's what everybody says. 

00:58:20
UNKNOWN I was really relaxed. And I know you're counting up, but I was in a very comfortable calm space, and I just wanted to stay there a little bit longer. 

00:58:30
BRENT GEARY Yeah, yeah, it's, well, people would even say that in your office in a 20 or 25 minutes trance. So, you're just doing it in five or six minutes. It's natural, yeah. But, anything that disrupted your experience or was a pretty smooth? 

00:58:45
NARRATOR No, it was pretty smooth. 

00:58:45
BRENT GEARY Good, good. Okay, well thank you so much for, for helping. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN No problem. It was a pleasure. 

00:58:55
BRENT GEARY Three things I want to say. Number one is Jeff came in and, and wants me to add a little bit to the announcement about going through the fundamental track here. On the final day you will sign something. You will get a certificate, and it will be mailed to you. Everything else I told you is still true. You need to come to each session, but on the final day at the "A" session, you will sign something. And then it will be mailed to you. Number two about the eye fixation technique, there is a, there's a reason always to, to have the person look behind you up at the, the wall. I noticed a couple people doing things with different forms of eye fixation. Don't make the mistake I did very early in my career. A person was standing across or sitting across from me, and I said "Just look at the point of my nose, and as you do." And this person kept their eyes open for 20 minutes. And I did ventriloquism, hypnosis, and I couldn't move. There was sweat dripping off me, and I said, "That's right." I made every suggestion I could eye closure, and they didn't even wiggle. So, that's why if you say look at a spot on the wall, make, make some para(ph) verbal type of movement to the person. If they're looking at you, say, "Don't look at me." Anybody remember "Blue Velvet"? If you don't remember "Blue Velvet", that seemed pretty bizarre. But, now you can go like Dennis Hopper in "Blue Velvet". The thing about counting is keep track of the numbers. Either do it on your fingers, persons eyes are going to be, a ha, you all laugh. Don't do it, and the next time you do, you're going to be, seven and you feel more and more, and you'll save yourself, "Did I say six or is six the next number?" So, either keep track on your fingers or on the notepad that you have in front of you, because it's easy to lose track. You're saying things in between. You're focused on something else, and you cannot remember if you already said six or six was just the next number. So, I keep it on my fingers, and like I say the person's eyes are closed, so it doesn't matter anyway. Okay. The practice we're just going to do five, four, three, two, one. But, in between the numbers, you're doing observation/suggestion, observation/suggestion. Okay? We are pressed for time. Five minutes each way. I just want a few minutes to, to talk to you at the end before you break and then go on to the rest of the day. So, five minutes each way please. Just turn and if it's most convenient, you could just work with the person you did before. Okay, shh. Those of you who didn't hear, please return the chairs to a semblance of the original positions. If anybody has any questions, please come to the microphone here. We have an opportunity to ask a couple questions if you'd like. 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN I'm curious in your suggesting, looking up at the eye fixation, looking up at something. Uh, excuse me, sort of, hello. Uh, in looking up at something, thank you, forget it. 

01:02:20
BRENT GEARY Why look up rather than not? 

01:02:20
UNKNOWN In looking up and, I'm wondering if you have any idea of or any conceptualization of the value of looking up versus straight ahead or down. 

01:02:30
BRENT GEARY Well, because it exposes more of the eye to the air, and the eyes are going to get irritated and the person's more likely to close the eyes. There are times when you are going to do hypnosis with people with their eyes open, but you want them to look down because they're going to keep their eyes open. People that have trauma. People that have poor ego differentiation, things like that. And so, you have them look down at the floor, look at a spot on their hand, and it's easy to keep your eyes open if you're looking down. But, with the eye fixation technique, what you want is that the person eventually closes his or her eyes, and, and if they are exposed to the air like this, they're not going to want to keep them open for very long. Now, some of the changes may be that you noticed or some, some people notice some things. Some people notice other things. And so, it's not a checklist. But, as you look at the spot sometimes it will seem to move. Sometimes the periphery gets blurred. Sometimes the spot will disappear momentarily. Sometimes if there's color around the spot, that will go to black and white or gray and then the color will come back. And then you'll also notice just how people start to blink quicker. These are things that you're observing, because they are things that are happening that show that you are with the person, that you're observing them. Another thing with the eye fixation technique the more familiar you do, you get with this, and I would recommend all of you some time sit and give yourself about five minutes and just stared a spot. And keep your eyes open for three or four minutes. There's going to be a point at which you want to close them. Keep them open just a little bit longer, so that you know these things that happen, because you can in essence to predict the person's experience. And, you can say, "While you're looking at that spot, I don't know whether or not you've experienced how that spot can move." And then the spot moves, they go, "Whoa." And, it's like you've predicted their experience. You've said something, and then it happens. And, it's not freaky deaky, it's just that you, the person gets the sense that you're right there with them. And it also increases your leverage. It increases your credibility as a hypnotist. Again, it's a little trick, so to speak. You know, anybody would know this after they do it. It's just utilization. It's being able to utilize something that can facilitate the process of absorption and can enhance the therapeutic relationship that you have with the person. Anybody have any other questions? 

01:05:05
[sil.] 

01:05:05
UNKNOWN I find that when I am doing an induction that my eyes want to close too, like in sympathy. And, and it's hard to keep aware of the other person, which is the job that I really have. But, it seems that I hesitate to let go of shutting myself down, because that keeps me relaxed and less anxious. 

01:05:35
BRENT GEARY Do you have toothpicks at your office? You just put them under the eyelids. Yeah, but do resist the the temptation. Do keep your eyes open. I mean, it's not a good thing to have your eyes open. Because, sometimes people will spontaneously come back from hypnosis, and they'll just pop open. And you're sitting there, and there is kind of this awkward moment. But, it's less awkward if you're looking at them, and you're not. So, do resist and keep your eyes open. Uh, one of the things may be you can, you can, that can help you is make more observations of their experience. This keeps you oriented externally. Stephen Gilligan has always talked about the therapist's externally oriented trance. We do go into trance when you're doing hypnosis. And the more familiar you get, you're not thinking about all the things, implied positive and truism and yesism. As soon as you're not thinking about those things, then you find yourself thinking into trance more. But, do keep your eyes open. Whatever it takes. 

01:06:35
UNKNOWN Can you say a little bit about some of the things that you're going to be seeding when you're going through the induction. You mentioned seeding some things for later on. 

01:06:50
BRENT GEARY That's an advanced technique. Don't worry about it right now. Put that off until later. If, if I give you that now, it's like asking the centipede when you move your 56th leg? You'll start to stumble across yourself. It's, that's a very advanced techniques. Get down the fundamentals first, and then you can start to, to move on to things like that. I'm not trying to be dismissive. It's just, it's, you need to learn the fundamentals. You have to have some practice. You have to have some experience before something very advanced like that starts to come into your awareness. But, you know, the more you practice, the more experience you get. You'll get to that point. But, but just learned the fundamentals right now. We have accomplished a day and a half of training in 90 minutes, and so you've all been great. Thank you very much, and enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you. 

01:07:40
Stephen Gilligan PhD 

01:07:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay Good morning once again. My name is Steve Gilligan. I apologize, it seems the inevitable technical problems have been encountered once again, so please excuse me for starting late. We have just a short period of time, an hour and a half, to cover a big topic about this notion of phenomenology, which is what happens in trance. What is the appearance of psychological process in trance, and how is it different from what you would experience in your ordinary so-called conscious state? And, what are the implications of those differences in terms of how we might work therapeutically. I always like to begin the day with a poem, partly to honor my Irish roots and partly to emphasize that therapeutic language at its best is poetic rather than literal. That is to say that we're looking to use language to get beyond language. We are looking to use language to get outside the box, if you will. A person's ego identity so that new possibilities can be created. And, we see this particularly in trance because one of the main ideas I'm going to be emphasizing about the difference between the conscious state, the ordinary ego conscious state, and what we call the creative trance state is the difference between what might be called a sign and a symbol. And, a sign is something that has a fixed meaning. It means the same thing in every context. It means the, the same thing pretty much to each person. And, in, in many contexts, this is the way to go. This is really important. So, when you're driving in your car and you pull up to a red light it is hopefully, everybody has the same meaning for that red light. Hopefully, you aren't, you haven't just, from a trance workshop that said well, to me today, red light means goes a little faster, but that's just me. That would be wise in that context, would it? So, there's a lot of contexts in which we want to have this meaning. But, there are a number of other contexts where we want to have variable meanings. And certainly, therapy which Dr. Erickson used to say, people come to psychotherapy because they are rigid. Because they've gotten some fixed map, some fixed understanding, some fixed way of being in the world. Your job, he said, is to help them to get on rigid. That's a pretty sophisticated theory, isn't it? So, the notion of a symbol is something that has multiple even contradictory meanings, some of which cannot be made explicit. An example of this, you probably all remember as you are old enough when John and Yoko got married. They got married in Canada and they have their honeymoon in the Toronto Hilton. And, they and thousands of other people were in that hotel suite for a week. That's where he came up with the song, "All we are saying is give trance a chance." And, this fellow, this came out a couple years ago, the young high school kid, Toronto high school kid, came sauntering into the suite with a cassette recorder. And, he walked up to John Lennon sitting naked in bed, and he said, "Mr. Lennon, can I ask you a few questions?" And Lennon graciously said, "Sure." And, the kid said, this is 1969. You remember the Beatles were everything back then. He said, "Some people say that there are many hidden meanings in the Beatles songs. What do you say to that?" And, John Lennon said, "I completely agree." He said, "Usually it takes me about six months before I have enough distance after we've made an album or albums back then to be able to finally listen to it." He said, "I'm always amazed when I listened to the album, because I realize there are things in there that I didn't know existed. And, I wrote the songs." And, he wasn't saying that their was something special about the Beatles, special about John Lennon. He was saying that's what art is. That's what art is. Art is a psychological context in which every particular pattern has many many many different meanings. We used to laugh being in Dr. Erickson's office because we'd come out after four or five hours of him going full bore with this story and that story. And, people would break out in these arguments about who he was actually talking to. Everybody was utterly convinced of course that the story was completely tailored to them and had this specific meaning and so forth and so on. And we would say who was, who was correct? From, from the point of view of a symbol, we'd say all of them are correct. So, one of the reasons we're doing trance is to help people shift into a creative space where all of their old rigid maps, which they are not working anymore. That's what the problem is saying. The way that you're thinking, the way that you're acting, the way that you're connecting isn't working anymore. You need to find new maps. You need to find new meaning. That's why we would have somebody go into trance. So, I want to read you this poem. It gives you a nice description of trance phenomenon, I think, without any formal hypnosis. This is by a German-American poet. Her name is Lisel Mueller. She grew up in Germany and actually came to the US to escape the Nazis when she was about ten. And this poem is called "Monet Refuses the Operation". And, how many of you have been to the museum L'Orangerie, museum in Paris? All right, if you're in Paris and you haven't gone, it's really something you have to go to, because they have these Monet paintings that are about 30 feet wide. And you sit in this oval room, and you sit on the bench. And, in order to apprehend the painting, you have to open a large peripheral space. You can't be like this with your attention. You have to go wide lens, so to speak. And when you go wide lens, things become a little bit more subtle, a little bit more blurry, a little bit more soft, a little bit more fluid. And that's what we're doing in trance. And then, from that particular place you can begin to reorganize the identity patterns. You can begin to reorganize however somebody is representing the world. So, here you hear it in this beautiful poem, where she says, "Doctor, you say that there are no halos around the streetlights in Paris, and that what I see is an aberration caused by old age. An affliction. But I tell you, it's taken me all my life to arrive at this vision of gas lamps as angels. To soften and to blur and to finally banish that edges that you regret that I don't see. To learn that the line that I called the horizon does not exist, and that sky and water so long most apart are the same state of being. It's been 54 years before I could see that the ruined cathedral is built of parallel shafts of sun. Now you want to restore my youthful errors, fixed notions of top and bottom, and the illusion of three-dimensional space wisteria separate from the bridge that it covers. What can I say to convince you that the houses of Parliament dissolve night after night to become the fluid dream of of the Thames. I will not return to a universe of objects that don't know each other, as if islands were not the lost children of one great continent. The world is flux and light becomes what it touches. Light becomes water. Light becomes lilies on water, above and below water. Light becomes lilacs and mauve and yellow and white and cerulean lamps, small fists passing sunlight so quickly to one another that it would take long streaming hair inside of my brush to catch it. The paint, the speed of light are weighted shapes, these of verticals burned to mix with air. And it changes our bones, our skin, our clothes to gases. Doctor, if only you could see how infinitely the heart expand and how heaven pulls Earth into its arms to claim the world. Blue vapor without end. Doctor, I refuse the operation." So, there's a, there's a lot to do I think with transit there. And, I'd like to give you just a little bit of a theoretical framework for understanding how and why and when trance phenomenon come up, what they are generally, how hypnosis has formalized them into trance phenomenon, how symptoms are versions of negative trance, the negative trance phenomenon thereby allowing the Ericksonian utilization principle to take the symptoms as a basis for transforming them into these resources. That's a lot to do in an hour, so let's get to it. So, this general theory of trance, all theories of trance hold some version of the dual mind hypothesis that you have what's called, of course in hypnosis, conscious mind and the unconscious mind. We start with this notion that there is no fixed structure to either the conscious mind or the unconscious mind, and that both reality and psychological identity are constructed. Subjectively, it may not feel like that. Subjectively it may feel like you're fixed. You're just the way that you are. But, all of neural science really is marshaling this evidence to emphasize that reality is constructed by the brain. It's not, there is no independent reality out there, independent of our participation, independent of our creative process. So, it can be constructed and is constructed in many many different ways. In this construction process we say that we've got two levels of mind, two minds. What we call, what I call the creative unconscious and what we might call the conscious mind. So, that there are so many different theories about what is the unconscious. And, like John Lennon's remark, I would say that to some extent they all have validity because again, there is no fixed structure to the mind. Freud looked into the unconscious. What did he see? Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my. Sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, oh my. I want to have sex with my mother and kill my father. Really? Interesting, Sigmund. Jung looked into the unconscious. He saw a pantheon of archetypal beings. Erickson looked into the unconscious. What did he see? He saw a vast repository of experiential learning. Interestingly, that's pretty much the same definition in Buddhists psychology. But, in the deeper Buddhism, what they call original mind, the Buddhists look in, and what did they see? Nothing. There's no content. They say original mind has two characteristics. It's empty, and it's luminescent. So, what creates the sense of objects or things or individuality are these filters that we use. So, we say that they creative unconscious is more like a quantum field that hold many many many different possibilities. One of my art therapy colleagues and students, Abby Miller, graciously did these slides. And, so when we talk about the unconscious, we say that every pattern has a virtual infinity of different forms. So, if you say, what "What does love look like?" Well, love looks like just about anything. What does love look like to you? There is, there is no fixed content. There is no fixed form. And, we might say in a quantum field is that you have what's called a superposition. A superposition basically is a mathematical wave equation that represents all of the different possible versions of something that exist simultaneously. What does that mean practically? It means that how many Steves are there? How many Steves can you see? So, in the conscious mind I can come in and I say, "I am depressed." Okay, and I'm totally convinced of it. That's my identity. But, in the unconscious mind is that your responsibility as a therapist is to see, I and infinite possibility of different Steves. Now how many can you see right now? How many of you can see a three-year-old Steve? Come on, it's not that hard. How many, can you see an angry Steve? Talk to my wife. How many can you see? Because, when you sit with a client if you accept their what, what we might consider loosely as an hypnotic induction, I am depression. I am anxiety. You can't help them. What we're looking to do is appreciate that while at the surface structure that they've gotten caught in the single map, at the deeper structure of the unconscious it's a field of infinite possibilities, okay. So, it's partly what we mean by a quantum field. And of course, if you have multiple contradictory realities simultaneously present, you couldn't have space, could you. You couldn't exist in time and space. So, a quantum field is not a time/space continuum. It's not represented through particular images. Some people say it's basically like a holographic blur, if you will. It's a sea of holographic frequencies. So, I emphasized this because when somebody goes into trance, they're stepping away from the classical world temporarily. because, they're saying, "Listen, however I'm constructing this classical world doesn't work well. I need to be able to construct something new." We have a saying in American card playing, You've got to know when to hold them and when to fold them. So, when the cards that you're holding, when the reality that you're experiencing isn't really fulfilling for you, you've got to go back to the drawing board, if you will. You've got to be able to throw in your cards. And to do that, that's what you're doing in terms of going into trance. So, in the trance you can see all these possible ways that I could construct, that I could view. Let's say that it's a marital problem. How do you represent your marital relationship? If you have a problem, you're representing it in a fixed way. Again, this was one of Erickson's simple, natural, key ideas about problems. Problems represent a fixed map. So we say, okay that makes sense. We all get stuck in our maps. As long as we have a way to step away from that map. Sir, put the map down. Step away from the map and go back into the ocean. Go back into the sea of infinite possibilities. Okay? That's what we're doing here with, with trance. So, this notion of how does the reality come to being out of this quantum world? The notion in a quantum view is that there is some observing consciousness. That would be you. That would be me. That would be communities. That would be cultures. That would be relationships. But, there are these observing consciousness that have these filters that open up to the unconsciousness, to the quantum world and transduce those frequencies, don't you love it when I talk like this, transduced those frequencies and voile, out pops what we call a reality. So, the color blue doesn't really exist in the world, does it? It's, it's a brain, it's a neural representation. It's the transduction of probably a certain set of frequencies, a certain set of waves that are out there that our brain transduces into the sense of there's something that's blue and I project it up there. So, this world that we create that we call our conscious world is that it has all these different sub modalities, if you will. So, some of the obvious, they're so obvious that oftentimes we don't even speak to them, but we have time/space as a basis. We have a sense of physical forms including our bodies. We have a sense of history, a past. We have a sense of, of of a future or what we represent as the future, possible futures. We have all these sensory modalities. So, these are the structural patterns by which reality and identity are created. Does that make sense? Okay, maybe you have to sit with that for a while. What the, the reason that were emphasized that is because these are the trance phenomenon. All those basic sub modalities are what start shifting when we go into trance, and when they are used in a certain way they, they translate into what we call hypnotic trance phenomena. So, I just want to say that in a healthy creative process, there is a movement between the conscious and the unconscious worlds. One of the things I think that Erickson, that I would criticize about Erickson, and I say that with, you know, my deepest respect for him is my greatest teacher, is that he tended to say the unconscious is intelligent. I think that's wrong. I think the unconscious has the potential to be intelligent, but it needs the conscious mind to be able to do it. And if, if the unconscious is so intelligent what are they doing in the office? Will you explain that, Dr. Erickson? And, surely when the person arrived in the office, there unconscious wasn't acting very intelligent, was it? But, something about the way that Erickson interfaced with that person's unconscious, the dialogue, the conversation that he had, that was a winning ticket. That really shifted things in a really interesting way. So, we say that, that in a normal healthy growth and change process is that you're going back and forth between two worlds. The conscious mind gives you focus. It gives you sequence. It creates meanings. It's able to set goals. And without those sorts of things, is that you can't do much, can you. So, this process of going back and forth of though is that invariably you will come to places where what you're doing doesn't work. If you do psychotherapy, that will be multiple times in each session, you probably noticed. There are are multiple times when you say, "well, I think it would be helpful to try this with this client." And you try it and go I don't think so. That doesn't work. They're throwing pillows at you, subtle cues that I think you need to change your approach. So, in a healthy process we say, okay let that go and try something else. Let that go try something else. So, there are certain times when you really need to go, let go of the deep structures of your identity. These are predictable, by the way. How many of you know the life changes checklist? I think they're called life stressful now. This is something that was developed in the mid-60s by a guy, Richard Atkinson at Berkeley. And it's a very simple paper and pencil test. You just list the sort of typical life changes that everybody will go through, most of them. There's a been a birth in the family. There's been a death in the family. There's a marriage. There's a divorce. Kids left home. There's been an illness. There's been a change of jobs. There's been a change of residence. Have any of you ever experienced any of these or read about people? So, if you give somebody that test, and you say, "Just check off how many of these have occurred in your life in the last six months, or the last year." And you count the number of checks, it's significantly correlated with who's having, who's going to be having psychological or medical symptoms. Make sense? Why? So, at those times those are what we would call identity change events. Let's say you have a death of a parent. Whether you were, whether you were close to your parent or distance, whether it was positive whether it was negative, I've heard from so many people that, "Wow, I'm just so surprised how much this shook me. How deeply it affected me when my mom died, when my dad died." Why is that? Well, for all your life your identity map has included a central feature: I am my mother's son or I am my mother's daughter. I am my father's son or my father's daughter. These maps are guiding how you walk, how you engage, how you think in the world. The death of the parent comes. Now the question is who the hell are you now? If you're not your mother's son, at least not at the same way, who are you now? When that map doesn't work anymore, you will spontaneously begin to go into a trance. Let me repeat that. When your maps did not work in a significant way, when they're disrupted, when they're inappropriate, where they don't fit is that the rug sort of gets pulled out from underneath, and you spontaneously go into a trance. Why? Trance is the naturalistic space that opens that is able to allow you to let go of your old identity and be able to create a new identity. Why? Because we say, that, that trance is the shifting as you're going from I'm mainly in the conscious world where everything is pretty much fixed. Okay, I'm here. You're there. That's over there. I'm this age. I've been here in my life. Everything is pretty much fixed in your conscious world. When you go into the unconscious, everything is moving. Everything is fluid. That allows you to be able to create something new. And the caveat is as long as you feel safe. As long as you feel it's a good thing to be able, I can let go. I can trust this. I can be able to open to all these new possibilities. If you can't, if you start getting pulled into the unconscious and you pull the emergency brake, I would suggest that is the most simple formula for creating a symptom. A symptom has basically two parts, one is it amplifies the unconscious is amplifying all the experience of the unconscious is getting more intense because something needs to change here. Something needs to heal. Something needs to transform. But, you're pulling the emergency brake. So, it's like driving a car with your foot flat on, down on the accelerator and your white knuckling the emergency brake as hard as you can. That car is not going to drive very well, is it? You're going to end up in a ditch in no time at all. That's called a symptom. So, what we're looking to do in the utilization approach is create a safe place where we can be able to let a person where, "I can let go. Not all at once. I may need to do it at my own rate, but I can ease on down into this creative world and be able to let the transformation occur." So, in this notion identity is organic and impermanent and very fragile. And, you will go through multiple deaths and rebirths in the course of your life, as an individual, as a couple, as a family, as a culture. Now, we're trying, there something happening right now at worldwide, certainly in the American culture, were what we had is not there. And some thing's calling to be born again. If we're white knuckling it and yelling at each other, we're going into the, the shadow land of symptoms. And I think we can see all the different symptoms thereof. So, my dear friend, Bill O'Hanlon, likes to tell the story of the, the woman who had five husbands. And, Bill was getting married for the second time, and not wanting to repeat the mistakes of his first marriage he would ask everybody he could that seemed to have a reasonably happy long term marriage, "Is there any tips or secrets that you can share with me?" And, in that inimitable O'Hanlon style, he would just walk up to people and ask them. He was introduced to an elderly woman at a party, and his friends pointed out, oh, she's been married to the same guy for 50 years. They have a really happy marriage. He said, "Anything you could tell me about staying married to the same guy happily for 50 years?" And she said, "I don't know who told you that, young man. " She said, "I've had five husbands." And he went gulp. And she started talking about her first husband, a romantic guy. Candlelight dinners, walks on the beach, flowers. I see some of your states changing. Oh, yeah. I remember that. Very sweet guy. And, after two years they were blest with their first child. And, she said, "And that then left me. I was mad. My second husband was a very different man. He was hard-working. He was worried about money. He stayed late at the office. No more walks on the beach. He'd better remember our anniversary. But, in time I grew to love him." And then something happened, and that guy's out of the picture. She's got a third. And it's only when she's talking about the fourth husband that O'Hanlon realized she's talking about the same guy. That, that marriage had five distinct marriages inside of it. I work a lot with couples, and I often tell couples this story. I say, "It sounds to me like your marriage is over." And they look at me like, we're paying you money to tell us this? And, I tell them the story, and I say, "Well, how many marriages do you think you've had so far?", Which is a really interesting question. There's usually the smile that passes between them, and then they start. Oh yeah, and then that happened. And so you want to have this idea, you're not the same identity hopefully, even though your partner may disagree, that you were at four years old. You had a certain identity map when you were for. Let's hope that you gone through some death and rebirth since then. So, what happens with those transformations of identity? You have this period of continuity and normalcy where everything's okay. You can just do your normal thing, and then you have these crisis periods. And every crisis is, is in this Ericksonian work, is a message something's trying to transform here. Somethings trying to heal. Somethings trying to happen here. And that's where trance occurs. So, trance is the movement into the creative unconscious. It's, it's letting go of the conscious mind and its rules and its patterns and it's structures. It's an amplification and a deepening into what I'm calling this quantum world of the creative unconscious. Okay, so what happens in this world spontaneously? Whether or not you suggest it, is that simply by virtue of going into a trance the world of appearances will begin to change in some distinct way. That's how we know someone is going into trance, because there are these significant subjective alterations in their experience. What are they? Well, some of the basic ones are there's something shifting in the body. Something's changing. I feel warm. I feel heavy. I feel tingly. I feel detached. My head feels bigger. There are so many different variations of this, but, but when the body experience starts changing, that's that the cue we're starting to move into the other world now. This is the transitional signal. The experience of time, because in the creative unconscious you have, you don't have sequential time. You don't have this linear orientation of time. So, atypical experience is I forgot about time, or time was no longer relevant, or you have an expense, or it dilates. So, a simple question that I've often asked peoples to sense how much they might've been in the trance, is after they come out I say, "How long did it feel like you had your eyes closed for?" If they had their eyes closed. And if we did 30 minutes of work and they said five minutes, that's, that's a typical sort of signal that, oh, they were in an experience where, where time was not being subjectively experienced in the same way. One of the great things, certainly in a therapeutic trance, is this critic, all those negative voices quiet down. One of the, the most common things, and clients are most happy about is, they say, "Wow, I w went into trance. For the first time I can remember things were quiet. I wasn't questioning everything." So, the critic gets silenced. The next general change is you have all this alteration in the sensory modalities. And, there are so many different variations, but how you see things, how you hear things, how you taste things, how you feel things. All these things go through significant, all of these are possible ways in which you have these significant subjective alterations. And, you, when they happen it's a good cue it's happening. The shift is beginning to happen. Another core thing that happens is things just seem to happen on their own. In the hypnosis world, this is talking about the principle of ideodynamicism. So, you see in all brands of hypnosis, as well as some of its cousins like meditation, like EMDR, there is this core simple suggestion, just let it happen. So, the sense of it's happening, but I'm not forcing it. I'm not consciously doing it. It's happening. It's coming from another place. Classically in hypnosis, my hands lifting, but it doesn't feel like I'm lifting it. Now, I just wanted to point out as a side, this is also a, a, a central feature of the symptom. A symptom has this characteristic that it's happening, but I'm not choosing it to happen. It's happening outside of my ego control. They say, "I don't know what got into me last night. I told myself I was only going to eat healthy foods, and then I found myself eating five gallons of ice cream." Okay? That's trance. That's ideodynamicism. Attention changes in many many different ways. One of the most typical things in therapeutic trance is absorption deepens. So this sort of scattered attention begins to settle down, and it becomes, I use the term absorption because it has the connotation that there is a somatic element to it. And finally, the, the trance, the, the way that, that things are ordered and understood logically is that move into, move from classical logic. And classical logic, one of the central laws is the law of the excluded middle, which basically says something and it's opposite cannot both be true at the same time. But, in trans-logic, it can. Niels Bohr, the great quantum physicists used to say, "There are two types of truth. And in the deep type of truth, the shallow type of truth, the opposite of the true statement is false." In the deep truth, the opposite of a true statement is equally true. The therapeutic implications, I think are significant. So, when I was 19, I had a partner, a classmate. And we, my first teaching partner, Paul Carter, we were students at Santa Cruz together. We were in Erickson's office, and Paul was 19, had a big mustache. Erickson had him go into an age regression. And, he was very sweetly talking to young Paul. He said, "How old are you?" Paul said, "Four." Paul really looked and sounded four. Erickson really like to play. And, he then asked, "Hey, what's that up there on your lip?" Of course, Paul is a 19-year-old had a big mustache. And he thought about it. And, he had a look of concern, and he said in his best four-year-old voice, "Nothing." He said, "No, I think you've got something up there on your lip. Maybe, did you eat some cornflakes for breakfast or something? Maybe you've got some cornflakes up on your lip." And, Paul said, "No." And, he said, "Well, why don't you reach up and touch it." He said, "No." "Why not?" "I know what's there." "Well, what there?" "Hair." Interesting, an adult wouldn't say hair, would they? They'd say mustache. It's more of a deframed word. He said, "Well, what's, what's hair doing on the lip of a four-year-old boy?" And Paul didn't know, so he had to go into it deeper trance, and then his eyes brightened up and he said, "That's easy. That's when I was older." And, Erickson laughed, and started talking about, "That's right. In a trance you can be a young child and you can be an adult at the same time." I think that some of the therapeutic implications of that should be clear, that you could be your problematic self or traumatized self. For example, an insecure self and you could be a confident self in a trance at the same time. You could be bold at the same time and much much more.

STEPHEN GILLIGAN So, these changes, so I want to point out, yet formalized in the tradition of hypnosis. So, what I want to emphasize to you is that trance is natural. It's, it's not a function of artificial technique or suggestion. I did my graduate work in psychology at Stanford, and I worked in the hypnosis lab of Ernest Hilgard. During that time, at the same time I would come out here on my quarter breaks. And Ernest Hilgard, that was the largest hypnosis laboratory in the world. And, he was the giant, alongside of Ericsson, what Hilgard did as an experimental psychologist, when he took on the study of hypnosis, was one of the primary people lifting hypnosis out of its abyss and back into respectability. Ericsson right alongside of him was the giant of clinical hypnosis. But, I would run the subjects in the standard hypnosis lab all the time, and then I would come out and see Erickson. And I have to really emphasize, you should not be using the same word to describe those two trances, those two types of trances, because one was very artificial. You will do this because I'm telling you to do it. Now you'll do this, etc. And, and while this may have an important value in and experimental context, where standardization is important. Clinically, it works against the process. So, Erickson used to say trance is natural. It isn't coming from the hypnotist. It's coming from life itself. It's coming whenever identity needs to be changed. It's coming when ever things are falling apart. That there's this natural experience of trance that begins to open up. And, those general phenomenon that we were just looking at is that are the signs and the general phenomenon. And, then what hypnosis does is it, is it has formalized them so they can be used in particular ways. So, usually, this is not an exhaustive list, but it's, it's a pretty good list in terms of age regression. And, what we want to appreciate for therapeutic purposes again, I know I'm covering a lot of ground here, but what we want to appreciate is these are the sub modalities by which identity is created. So, one of our main purposes in using trance phenomenon is to say you have the power to create a new experiential identity. You have the power to be able to shift and transform your brain maps. To improve them, to make them more whole. So, therefore when we use these, when we use age regression what we're really saying therapeutically in my view is that you can have a creative relationship with your past. It's, it's a very clear thing, that memory is constructed. Memory is not objectively fixed in any way. Every time you remember something, you're reconstructing it, and there's that reconstruction that goes back into the record, however that's organized. So, there is no fixed past, if you will. So, what we want to then say to a person is that you can take advantage of this, and rather than feeling like you're a victim of your past, you can, you can have creative mastery in your relationship to your past. So that everything, every place that you've ever been is that you can creatively utilize on your path. That's Ericksonian 101. Do you believe that's possible? Brothers and sisters, do you believe? Do you believe? Yeah. Do you believe? Do you believe that you can have creative mastery of your past? That's what we're saying. Then what trance phenomenon is a tool, it is a process for somebody to say, "Yeah, I get that." I mean, if I just tell you you could have a greater relationship to your past, you'd say, "Yeah, I read that book, too." But, the age regression is an experiential mind/body learning, for you to say, "Yeah, I got it." Is that I, I can be able to have this creative relationship to my past, to my future, too. And there's so much research that shows that what we expect, what we hold as our future significantly influences where we end up in our life, whether it's the notion of expectancies or expectancy bias or self fulfilling prophecy is that the images that we have about our future is that make a huge difference in where we end up in our lives. So, in trance were saying, let's not have them unconscious and fixed. Let's take a step back from having to act and be somebody out of the world. Let's take a step back. Let things get fluid. Let myself connected to this process of what kind of future I want to create, and then use this trance phenomenon to be able to create that desired future. So, you, if you're in your conscious mind all those things are locked. They're fixed. They're in a conservative mind. When you go into trance, everything is fluid. So these other things with ideodynamicism is that one of the main ideas that you're really interested in communicating therapeutically is that there is an intelligent deeper inside of you that your ego, thank God. There is a power greater that your ego. Oh, man. That's good to know. So, so when we say, "Let your unconscious do it. Let your finger signal. Let your hand lift.", These are ideomotoric, idiot dynamic phenomena. Ideomotoric, is that just let a memory come to you. Let something develop on its own. This, this is the mastery skill that we want to generally explore with this ideodynamicism, and then it can be used in more specific applications, depending on the particular aspects of a person's given situation. As I said, time distortion, you can expand your sense of time, and again let's say somebody is in a very anxious mode. And, part of the anxious mode is I don't have enough time. I just, I can't get it done. And, remember, I've got so much work. I've got so much work. I've got work harder. I've got to work harder. Anybody of you know people like that? Might be yourself. Okay. So, we say that, that part of what's driving that is that your sense of time is that it's not enough. So, we could open the experiential space, this sub modality, this matrix, this mandala, this mosaic of the psychological identity that you're using. We can say, "Let's take that sense of time and soften it and expand it." Let's say for example, common suggestion, you can take two minutes of clock time, all the time in the world for your unconscious. That would be a very very simple sort of suggestion for time distortion. Two minutes of clock time, all the time in the world for your unconscious. And, you have your relationship to seeing things, not seeing things, hearing things, not hearing things. Again, these are really integral in most people's symptoms. If you grow up in, in a abusive, around addiction or abuse, probably you learned the trance phenomenon of negative hallucination. I grew up in an alcoholic family. We just didn't see it. We didn't see it. We didn't see it. We didn't hear it. We didn't feel it. And all that abuse was going on. So, as, as kids we learned to use trance phenomenon to protect ourselves the best ways that we could. But, you can do it even better once you get the sense of connection to yourself, and you're in a safe environment. Okay, so these are, are the trance phenomenon. I know Bill O'Hanlon is going to be talking more about them. Bill and I have not too dissimilar emphasis. So, what I want to emphasize for therapeutic purposes is that trance is not necessarily a positive experience. When we see trance as a naturalistic thing, as a movement into this quantum world where time and space, everything is fluid, then we also need to appreciate that every experience in the unconscious has equal capacity to be negative or positive. Let me repeat that. Every experience has equivalent capacity to be negative or positive, so there is nothing inherently about trance. What gives it its value? You do. You're the difference that makes the difference, or we should say it's the human presence. So, we've got the unconscious, and the unconscious can go any which way. It's how it enters into human connection and human presence that not only collapses it into a particular form, but determines whether it's positive or negative. So, if there is a loving, skillful, human presence that is able to be present when the unconscious opens up, that will be a experience. If when the unconscious begins to amplify, when your body for example, begins to shake, rattle and roll. You begin to feel something is happening in my body. And everybody around you says, "Don't do that. That's bad. You go crazy." And so you, you have this response happening. And you have this reaction to it. Again, that's going to create a negative trance. That's going to create a symptom. So, the value of the trance, and the value of each trance phenomenon is a function of the human context. So, some of these simple questions is, are you saying I, I'm open to this? Welcome. So, one of the main communications that I use in trance related work, is I ask, say, "What would you say your problem is?" He says, "Well, I got panic." Okay, I think one of the worst contributions that psychology in general and psychotherapy in particular has made to the general community is that it has dehumanized all of, all of these symptoms. And, we know that dehumanizing something is the most crucial step to allowing violence against it. So, when we talk about something as panic, you think, "Well, that's not human. I'll just medicate it. You know, I'll just kill it. I'll just get rid of it." We would say in this approach, so there's a presence inside of you that is filled with a sense of panic. That's interesting. Where you feel it most of your body. "Well, I feel it here." That's interesting. And I would like to say to that presence in you that is filled with panic, welcome. Welcome. I'm sure that whatever you're doing, whatever your experiencing makes sense. Welcome. So, then I usually say, "What do you know is happening when you hear that?" Usually, people say, something relaxes and calms down. Occasionally people say it gets, it backs up. So, that's good to know. That it needs a lot of space. Thank you for letting me know that. So, we begin to regard it in human terms, but most importantly we realize it's, it's the way that it is humanly regarded as positive or negative that determines whether it has a positive or negative value. Secondly, as I was mentioning, is that there's this notion of the level of trust. So, every client's going to have some question: is it safe to let go. Basically, what you're asking somebody to do in a trance induction, you're saying, "I'd like to help you lose your mind." Hi, my name's Steve, and I'm going to be your hypnotic server today. And I'd like to help you lose your mind at least for a while. And, if somebody goes running out of the office screaming, you say, "Well, let me rephrase that." But, that's what a trance induction is. It's a deconstruction of your reality. It's a deconstruction of your reality. And so what we face is this question, once you let go of your verbal mind temporarily. Once you let go of it's got to be this way, with the iron grip, is there something else inside of you that is there to catch you. That's the unconscious. Or is this the only game in town. Most people know that they're not doing a good thing by white knuckling it. But, they think of it as the lesser of two evils. They say I know that it is not doing me any good to be so controlling and so freaked out and so paranoid and so scattered. I know that that that's not the best thing, but it's better than the alternative. And the people, person's imagined alternative, I let go and all hell will break loose. A lot of these times, a lot of times they are primordial terrors that people don't even consciously believe. So I, a lot of times I'll just ask them, "If you were to, I'm just going to ask you this question, if you are to let go inside, what would happen? I just want you to listen to what you hear." And people will find all sorts of things. I was just working with somebody last week, and she said, "Wow, that's interesting." I said, "What did you find?" She said, What was there was I'll just completely disappear." Is that good or bad? She said, "It's terrible." I said, "That's good to know. So you've got this believe that if you let go of conscious control that you learned that that you would just completely disappear. No wonder, it makes sense that you'd hold on. Do you think we can find a way carefully, safely to see if that's true or not? And, and I'm going to have you teach me what it means to be safe." I'm going to have you teach me how to do this. You're gonna have your unconscious teach me, you know, how fast to go, how slow to go, how to do it, so that you can be able hopefully to have a sense that there's something deep inside of you that you really can't trust. And those times when you really need to get out of your head, you can do it safely, and you can do it skillfully. So, in order to do that, you'd better be in a reasonably good mind/body state. So just as an example, if I'm like this and you say, "Just let go and let happen whatever happens." I don't think you want to tell me that, because through this filter I'm going to have a nasty experience. Does that make sense? So, we need to say that the way the unconscious is experienced is a function of the mind/body filter. So we do a lot of things in terms of what I call the three positive connections, which is center, open to a positive intention, and connect with resources. Connect with whatever community in your life ready that you have a sense supports you. And then we'll talk about going into trance. These are all contextual dimensions. So, we say we want to make sure that when we say to the unconscious, "Go for it.", When we say, "Let it happen" is that we have a reasonably positive state inside, in the body/mind, in the relational connections, because that context is what will determine what happens. Make sense? And, one final thing I want to emphasize about this is the, probably the single most important determinant of whether the unconscious is creative and positive or negative is whether it has musicality. Who was it? Was it, was a George Bush who said, "If it ain't got swing, it don't mean a thing." Was that George Bush? I think that was Duke Ellington. If it ain't got swing, it don't mean a thing. What we see from the attachment bonding research is that the way that, that, you know, they say in attachment bonding now, the way that you bring a young child's brain online into the human community, because kids need to be brought into the community, into the sense of belonging to part of the human community is mostly musicality and call and return. So, how does a mother and a child talk? Any of you seen these Harvard research? They've got the mother with the kids sitting there. There are some toys. And they say watch, watch what the language is. And the mom says, "look, there's a dinosaur." The mother doesn't say, I'd like to inform you that there is an object that we humans call dinosaurs sitting in front of you. That's, that would not be really something you'd see, right? Look, there's a dinosaur. You hear the music? And the kid goes, "dinosaur". And the mother says, "Yeah." Call and return. Yeah. Purple dinosaur. Purple dinosaur. It's, it's music. And people like (inaudible) say, "I've been forced to admit on the basis of the research that the basic human language is musicality." If it ain't got swing, it don't mean a thing. So, in the, in this research, they did this terrible stuff, where they give the mother a signal. They say, "When we give the signal, we want you to play dead. We want you to just pass out." Now, this could be depression. This could be drugs. This could be I've got ten kids and get jobs. This could be, you know, my marriage is not but I'm not present. So when the mother's given the sign, is that the kid who's just in this musicality, is that it says, "Purple dinosaur." And nothing. "Purple dinosaur." Nothing. And he starts looking up, and then he starts flipping out. And what the research shows is that there are three general classes of behavior that follow as long as what they call the bond is ruptured and repaired. As long as the bond is ruptured, that the belonging to human community with an underlying sense of musicality. Breathing, rhythm, connection, limbic resonance. These are the heart of trance work is that you have anger. You have a lot of acting out with aggression. Listen to AM radio. That damned Obama. He's a communist. So again, you have compulsive doing, compulsive doing. I've got to do it. I've got to do it. I got to work. I've got to work. I've got to go shopping. I've got to do this. I've got to do this. What do I do? What do I do? The clients come into therapy and say, "What'll I do? What do I do? What'll I do? What do I do? What should I do in therapy?" I say, "What'll I do? What do I do? What do I do? Would like to do? " This means that you're not in the bond of the creative unconscious in the world. And the third is you give up. You give up. These are symptoms, right? Anxiety, depression, addiction, compulsion. These are the unconscious that are acting out without a human connection. So, what we're looking to do entrance is get our boom boom going. So, like in the training workshops I do, some of the extended ones, we just do open up with musicality. So you get one person getting a gentle connection with somebody saying, "Boom boom. Boom boom. Boom boom. Boom boom. Boom boom." A heart beat. Getting language. getting the psyche back down into the earth, into the heart beat. And then using nonverbal, what we call nonsense syllables. Shatatababa. Sadawa. Shadatabab. Washa. Watapo. Watobo. Just get a sense of what happened. As long as you feel respected, supported is that the space starts to open up. And that's the, that's the generative trance field. In that field we are open for the business of re-creating the self, because I'm not holding on. I'm not spaced out. I'm present. I'm connected here. I feel the music. Now, I get the idea is that I can be able to shift my relationship to my past as long as I'm connected here, boom boom, and feel the connection. Keep the connection, boom boom. Boom boom, you really can shift that relationship to your past, boom boom. So, we are opening up a sort of a Soup bowl, what I call sponsorship mind. This happens at infancy. It needs to happen throughout the life cycle. That's what we're doing in the, in the hypnotherapy work. So, I hope that you don't get into the idea, I'm here to program you with new suggestions. That's the problem. That's not the solution. The problem is that people have been hearing everybody else tell them what they should do or how they should be or what they are or whatever. We are looking to create a space where you can find how it opens up from inside of you. What's created from inside of you. So once we got the space, then we, we have this sense of this, this way to begin to transform things. So, we've got about 10 minutes. Maybe I'll open to any questions. I always say it's a big topic, and you have to come to, to the microphone. 

02:15:15
UNKNOWN Uh, you talked about creating a creative relationship with your past, and I'm wondering if you could say a little bit more about kind of what you alluded to when people have had pasts where they've been very abused, neglected, abandoned and so forth, and they're filled with shame and guilt. Uh, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how to move forward with that. 

02:15:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, sure. Well, it's a big question. I'll touch upon a couple parts. First of all, if you remember what I started out with saying, is that a person comes in and in natural hypnosis terms, they've got an hypnotic induction that they're running on themselves and everybody else about who they are. And so, when a person comes in and they say, "I am, I am an abuse survivor. I'm somebody who's been abused." That may be valid, but if it's the only game in town, then that's a problem. So, the existentialists used to like to say psychopathology is precisely the study of loneliness. That is to say, psychopathology is precisely the study of loneliness. When you only have, the one thing is separated out from its larger community, you're in deep trouble. We know for example, with eating disorders that, that one of the strongest predictors of who is going to have eating disorders is who is eating by themselves. I, my wife is Chinese, so I have a Chinese family, and, you know the Chinese , food belongs to the group. It doesn't belong to the individual. So, in China I've often had my hand slapped because, like an American, I think, "Oh, look at that food. Let's shuffle a bunch of that." But, you're only allowed two bites maximal on this little plate, because you take a bite, and it passes around. Next person does it. You get your chopsticks. You eat it. You know, and it comes around. But, we find people who are eating by themselves have much higher, people who were drinking by themselves, and I don't even want to mention sex. But when you do something in isolation is that the probability that it's going to be negative is very high. So, when you experience your identity as an abusive survivor and only abuse survivor, then you're in trouble. So, what we're, this notion of the quantum self means they are an abuse survivor, and they are much much much more. Before I trust myself to think, before I trust myself to act to communicate with them, I first have to be able to sense, identify and invite to the table other parts of the person at the same time. A person, if somebody is really into it, I say, "Well, well, what would you say are the positive parts?" "I don't got no positive parts in my life." Well, that's interesting. So, we relax. We breathe for a little bit. "Where did you go with you when you got abused? Everybody goes somewhere. When things got really bad where did you go?" I was working with the woman recently, she was abused by her, her father and then her brothers. I said, "Where did you go?" She said, "We grew up on a farm. I went out into the forest and I climbed to tree." "That's interesting. What was that like?" "Well, I could relax." "Well, that was interesting. Anybody, did you meet anybody up there?" "Well," she smiles, "Yeah, there was this nest, and there were these birds. And I got really connected with the birds." So, the reason I would be saying that is now we have at least two of the identities at the table. Somebody who was abused and somebody who had a good experience with birds. I would say minimally you should have at least three different ego states that are all in the field before you would really tune into any traumatic, traumatized material, because now what you're watching, you want to touch it without them collapsing into it. And that's basically our therapeutic goal, right? You don't want them having to disassociate. You don't want them having to fall into it. So, you titrate. So, you're watching. You touch it a little bit, and you see when they start to collapse, then you say, "So, what were the names of those birds." The person usually, it's a state shift. And they go back into a positive state. And then you have the touch back into here. I mean, it really is the old model of systematic desensitization, really is implicit in this. So, you're, what you're doing therapeutically, and what you can do entrance work very well is that you can shift attention fluidly. Touch it and then touch something else in your life. Touch something else. That's one response I give you. Do not reduce your client to their symptom. Now the DSM does this, right, but how many psychologists, how many therapists actually honor them. Very few. So, that's one ego state. And, you're there to say, "You are much much more than your problems." So, that's one thing. Secondly, when I, when I do age regression or experiences with the past, I learned partly because of, of situations like this that rather than saying to a person, "Go back into the past", is that usually I say, "Get your connections here." Sometimes I'll have the person keep their eyes open and stay connected with me. That's a, a, a stabilizer. Connect with something here, connect with other parts. And then, when you're unconscious is ready, I'd like you to let your unconscious bring forward through time any experiences that need to be healed here today, and let them come forward in time. And let them come into and join us here in your present self. Because what we really want to appreciate from the time that somebody got wacked, they got traumatized, they've been on a journey. Everybody I know has been on a resource journey. So, while part of them got trapped and is still stuck in that past, another part of them has developed a lot of different things. It usually has not been applied to themselves. Usually they developed it by, by working other people. So, I usually say to clients, "Do you think it's time to stop using other people for guinea pigs? I mean, you've learned how to love. You've learned how to care by, by using other people as guinea pigs. I think whatever is happening is calling you to cut out the middleman and go straight for it. And bring the resources that you have now that you didn't have than to connect to the part of you that was wounded." So, so the notion of bringing the past forward into the present, I think therapeutically I found to be much safer in terms of doing that work. Make sense? Please? 

02:23:10
UNKNOWN Hi. 

02:23:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hi. 

02:23:15
UNKNOWN So, I think you've answered, uh, part of my question. My, my question was initially addressing the comment that you made, you want to make sure that your, you have some reasonably positive emotional state in mind and body before going into trance, that you have supports. I think, I think that's what you are saying. So, you did answer that a little bit just now. It's not necessarily external support, it's also support from within you from past experiences. So, I'm thinking about a situation in which somebody presents to you that they have basically, they're presenting that they have no supports or very minimal. And I guess, it's really important to make that assessment as to whether or not they're in a position to be ready to proceed with hypnosis with you. I'm wondering what your next step would be. Would you then in a psychotherapeutic way discover those kinds of supports in the different ego states or could you use hypnosis to discover those supports before going to the trauma? 

02:24:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Absolutely. But, so, but my first response is you want to appreciate, this is part of a hypnotic induction that somebody is using. That I have no support anywhere in the world. I, I don't necessarily believe them. okay? I believe it's part of that identity. I mean we all know that we can get in that state. Nobody loves me. Nobody cares about me. I worked so hard all the time. Nobody really. How many of you know that state in yourself? How many of you know it in clients? Okay. So, you realize that to some extent is a function of your state. It's a belief of that state. So, the first thing to do is to notice how it hypnotically affects you as a therapist. When somebody brings up negative stuff, it usually zaps your body. So, you need to receive the trance, but all this centering, opening, it has to go on it you first. So, you've got to like keep releasing all this stuff, because if I believe that, I'm going to be in this state of, "Oh, this port idiot needs so much of my help, but I don't know if they can do it. Probably hypnosis is, is not going to be safe. Okay. I'm going to ask you to just relax a little bit." But, part of it is I bought into that your deepest self is a problem. Now, I just want to point out that it's possible for anybody at any moment to step out of suffering and into a spiritual orgasm. How about a joke? Okay, so you see that somebody would be so, like, caught up in their stuff, and you get a good joke and what happens is that all of a sudden, if only for those moments, is that all of it's gone. You're like open. So, what does touch this person? So, of it is the nonverbal way that you are connecting with them, because of the person says, "I feel, I, I got no resources whatsoever.", And if you've trapped into it in your body, you will not be able to think outside of that box. So, what were doing is were saying, "Okay, I got that. I make room for that, and now I want to let go so I can ask the question. Hold the question, like meditationally and ask who else are you? Who else are you?" So, I'm looking for the positive places in your life, and I have never found somebody who doesn't have them. So, as long as you're in the problem trance, there's no way out. So, what were trying to do is to unbind somebody from this is very overly narrow not fully representative state. We need to use our self, the music of tenderness, of fierceness, of playfulness in some sort of limbic resonant way to say I know you're in there. I know that even though that there is a part of everybody that is wounded, there's also a deep presence inside of everybody that's unwounded and unwoundable. Unwounded and unwoundable. Now I'm going to talk a little Californian with you. That's, that's your subtle body. That's your body of light. And then you think, "Ah, geez, is that Californian or what?" But, listen to every culture and how many metaphors of light that they use. We say that person was glowing. That person was shining. They were sparkling. They were radiant. What's all that about? Are they really just random ways of talking? Or is this a place inside of you where you are always whole and unwounded and unwoundable. If you're a body of light, how do you damage light? Come here, you fuckin' light. I'll get you. So, so what we learned in trance is you have these different selves, and one is this one, muscular, based in this world. And then you've got another body that's a subtle body. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to be able to sense that presence and then use all of your skills to touch it and sweetly invite it out to play. So, one of the main things that will block you is the identification with the problem. Now, I'm not saying you you ignore the problem. You need to have compassion. You need to have respect for it. But, if you reduce yourself to the problem, I don't believe you can really help the person. Because you've stepped into the same trap, that suffering and, and being a victim is my deepest identity. No, it's not, because whatever was done to you it couldn't take away your spirit. Your spirit is, is alive. And so, make this connection here, feel into it. Touch it. Begin to feel the musicality of beginning to invite it out. That's what we are doing in trance. Okay? All right, so we have to stop. But, I thank you all for your presence here. Thank you. thank you.

Michael Yapko Ph.D. 

02:30:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Welcome back from lunch, everyone. And, good afternoon. I'm Michael Yapko. I'm very glad to be here with you this afternoon. I'm particularly pleased to see how many people are attending this fundamental hypnosis track, people who are, at least in theory, getting their first exposure to hypnosis. And, you're being exposed to many different presenters over the course of these days. And, I am hoping that you're enjoying what's going on and that you'll continue to. This afternoon my topic, not quite sure how I drew it, but I drew it. My topic is on hypnotic inductions and what makes for a good induction. So, I came in to watch Brent's presentation this morning to make sure that I didn't duplicate what he said, and also sat in on Steve's to make sure I didn't duplicate what he said. So, I'm hoping that all the things that I present to you this afternoon are relevant and interesting to you. I'm going to take a slightly different perspective about all this. And, really for a very important reason that I want to establish here at the outset. You may or may not know that the field of hypnosis is deeply internally divided, much the same way that the field of psychotherapy itself is deeply divided. It has been said that there are over 400 different distinct forms of psychotherapy, each with different assumptions. Each with different premises about what the appropriate targets are of treatment, with the appropriate mechanisms are of treatment. And, the same is true for the world of hypnosis. You have hypnosis as an experiential Rorschach. It's a inkblot. And, what hypnosis therefore invites are people's projections. So, in the same way that Stephen was describing this morning that here's how Floyd looked at the unconscious and here's how Jung looked at the unconscious and here's how Erickson looked at the unconscious, and then Steve gave you his version of the unconscious. These differing viewpoints all represent different facets of the same phenomenon. No single one of them explains or fully describes anything. And, so it poses a bit of a challenge to us in the field as we learn hypnosis, and talk about hypnosis, and describe hypnosis, and experiment with hypnosis, and attempt to quantify hypnosis. The challenge is how do we take this ambiguous stimulus, this experiential Rorschach and offer projections that actually have a chance of making a difference in people's lives. So, a lot of what is happening as you learn hypnosis is you're learning a language, but how you express yourself will absolutely be idiosyncratic. It will be your way of approaching people, and I think we've reached a point of understanding that it's much much less about being right and it's much much more about being effective. And so, for me it's important as I do hypnosis trainings it's never a goal of mine to crank out 250 more hypno-Yapko's. What, what I'm much more interested in is each person finding their voice, each person developing their own style, their own way of approaching things. And, to be the most congruent that you can be is important. And, it's also important of course to have enough information, enough realistic information, in order to be able to function credibly. Now, the field of hypnosis, being as internally divided as it is, you should know that the Ericksonian perspective is one perspective. Now, it happens to be one that I favor for a number of reasons, but that isn't because other viewpoints don't have merit. It's always about how does this research finding translate into a clinical approach. How does this theoretical construct translate into a clinical approach. And what a difference between the world of researchers at the world of clinicians. You know, Steve spoke to this briefly when he was describing Hilgard, one of the great pioneers in the world of hypnosis and one of the people who most single-handedly helped shape how we even think about hypnosis, even within the Ericksonian perspective. Because, it was Hilgard who experimented with dissociation, and though no one has said it yet, dissociation is the defining characteristic. If you don't have dissociation present, then hypnosis is happening. But, most people only learn about dissociation in the context of psychopathology. So, they learn about dissociative identity disorder, and they learned about psychogenic fugue states and so for, when in fact as you're learning here, dissociation represents a neutral phenomenon. It's capable of good things. It's capable of not so good things. So, the fact that dissociation is a foundation of being able to produce hypnotic responses. Dissociation that gives rise to the automaticity of hypnosis. It's one of the most interesting aspects of hypnosis, the phenomenon of automaticity. The fact that people can generate these responses in response to suggestion that even they themselves don't know really how they produce. So, it gives rise then to the ability to use suggestion in a variety of ways. Now, there is an important starting point. We've been talking about suggestion. Where a good training in hypnosis begins is in recognizing all therapy is suggestive. You can't escape using suggestions. You can't ask someone a question, how do you feel about that, without suggesting something. So, being cognizant of the different forms of suggestion, the different styles of suggestion, the different structures of suggestion. How many different ways there are to phrase something, and the challenge is always how can I phrase this in such a way that the person can actually hear it, that the person can actually respond to it in a way that's meaningful. But, there's something that happens in hypnosis that's a very different. If I were to give you the suggestion in the next 10 seconds, I would like you to make your left arm numb from the elbow down, how many of you could do that? Look around the room, and you see two hands go up out of the room of 250 some people. What that tells me is most of you do not have any kind of conscious deliberate strategy for being able to produce an anesthesia in your arm. Then you go through this procedure called an induction, and I give you the exact same suggestion for numbness in your arm, and lo and behold, you experience numbness in your arm, a numbness sufficient to withstand having surgery on it without any chemical anesthesia. Now that, is remarkable. And if you ask me as a quote unquote hypnosis expert how does that happen exactly, my highly insightful and wonderfully articulate response is, "I don't know." I don't know anybody who does know. I knew a few people who think they know, but when you know how to answer that question seriously, go to Stockholm and pick up your medal. You'll have earned it. It's, it's one of the most compelling aspects of working hypnotically, is the fact that people can gain access to these resources that they don't know how to get to another ways. And it's one thing to frame symptoms as an invitation for transformation. It's one way to talk about hypnosis as being able to access your creative unconscious, but it's very different in clinical practice when you're sitting across from someone who is suffering the ravages of terminal cancer, who says, "Help me." And in that moment, what are you going to say? What are you going to do that's going to make a difference in how this person experiences himself or herself? And this is the world of desperation as hypnosis works its way into, it has worked its way into behavioral medicine programs across the country. If you bother to go to the websites of major universities, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and their behavioral medicine programs, hypnosis is already well integrated. And there is a huge body of scientific literature about the applications of hypnosis in treating just about every disorder you can name. And, you don't need to reinvent the wheel, and this is one of the first things I want to say to you is, whatever client population you're treating there have been people who have already been doing hypnosis with those kinds of folks. And, it's a great idea to hit the journals. And, there are two primary journals in the United States that publish hypnosis information. Both of them also have websites, so that you can actually access information online. I want to share that with you. The first and primary journal is called "The International Journal Of Clinical And Experimental Hypnosis". Arive Barabas(ph) at University of Washington is the editor of that Journal, and it publishes some of the most quoted, most often cited research in the field of hypnosis. And, that journal is one that actually is awarded to you when you join the International Society of Hypnosis, of which the American component is the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, which Brent briefly mentioned this morning as the premier hypnosis society for clinicians who use hypnosis, and who ultimately want certification. And, as he mentioned the 20 hours here count toward certification. It's not in and of itself certification, but the hours count toward certification. There are additional requirements. And, I would also mention therefore that you might want to go to the website, www.asch.net, which is the website for the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. And it is largely represented by a broad array of professionals practicing hypnosis: physicians, dentists, psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists. And, the key point is it's the primary voice for people who are interested in the field of hypnosis and who want membership and certification and all those kinds of things. So, just something to tell you about. But, it serves the, and the other one is the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. Stephen Langton(ph) is the editor. Many of you know Steve. He was involved with many of the activities here for many many years, and he has done a phenomenal job with the Journal. As editor he has really elevated the quality of articles. It is also very widely cited. He's really brought a great scientific bent to it, which I appreciate. But, the fact that there are these different models of hypnosis, and each one gives you a different viewpoint. It raises questions like who is capable of hypnotic experience? To what degree? Why are some people easier to work with hypnotically than others? Is this just about personality? Is it about cognitive factors? Neurological factors? Things that are being tested routinely in both clinical and research contexts. Now one of the things that virtually everybody in the field agrees with, no matter what their orientation towards hypnosis, is that people differ in their capacities for hypnosis. What that means exactly is still wide open to discussion, and people debate it to this day. But, there isn't anybody who questions the fact that people vary in their ability. And part of what we're trying to understand is why. So, for those of you who do things like, how many of you already use hypnosis in your practice, just out of curiosity? How many of you use techniques like mindfulness in your practice? All right, so you can affirm what I'm saying. When you use hypnosis, when you use mindfulness, have you noticed how different the range of response is from your clients? You don't get a uniform response. There are some people who will sit up and open their eyes and say, Wow, that was the most amazing experience of my life." And then, there are people who will sit up and open their eyes and go, "So?" And no real appreciable response to it. And so, what this conference is about, and what Ericsson's work was about is how do we reach more people? How do we make this something that is more amenable to clinical practice? And of course, Ericsson was absolutely the innovator, and I'll give you just a 30 second little bit of history. But, when you look at the people who shaped the field of hypnosis, they all without exception got their training at the beginning of the 20th century. Ericsson did his training in the 1920s. William Kroger(ph) did his training in the 1920s. Hilgard did his training in the 50s. David Cheek and Leslie LaCrone(ph) and, and all the people who were very powerful in shaping this field. And in the beginning of the 20th century, there was only one model of hypnosis. It was the traditional model of hypnosis that was brought over from Europe from the likes of Charcot(ph) and particularly Bernheim. They had competing hypnosis schools in Paris. And, Bernheim famously said there is no hypnosis. There is only suggestion. And so, the idea was direct suggestion, very authoritarian style. You will do this. You will do this. You will do this. That's all there was. And you can see why people lost their interest in it, because most people don't like to be told what to do. So, Ericsson, being a keen observer, recognized that the capacity for hypnosis was one thing, but how do we access it? And the things that matter to people the most, of course, are their own experiences. Hence, the birth of the naturalistic approach, that instead of saying to somebody, "I'm going to count downward from ten to one. Ten, relax. Nine, deeper, deeper, deeper. Eight, relax, relax. Seven, going deeper, deeper, deeper. Six, five, four, three, two, one. Now you're in deep hypnosis." Now, from my point of view that's one of the most brain-damaged ways of doing hypnosis that I can think of. Why? What's the relationship between counting numbers and going into hypnosis unless you happen to be an accountant? The numbers don't mean anything. The numbers are metaphor. They're metaphorical, which raises another question. Who response to metaphor? Not everyone responses to metaphor in the same way, because metaphor itself is also an abstract communication. It too is a verbal Rorschach. You can guarantee that where people are exposed to metaphor they are still going to be interpreted in their own idiosyncratic way. You tell this wonderfully elaborate metaphor about Adam and Eve, and what does this person conclude? You should eat fruit when you're naked. That's what they walk away with. So, all of these things, all the things that we learned about the styles of suggestions, and the structures of suggestions and the delivery of suggestions revolves around the question then, how do we facilitate this person gaining access to these hidden resources? The fact that I ask you right now to generate anesthesia in your arm, and most of you can't, says nothing about your ability to generate an anesthesia when you're in hypnosis. And of course, this is where the neuroscience has gone. As you listen to people here, people liberally use the word trance. In the scientific literature, the word trance has all but disappeared, because as the research shows, people don't feel like they're in a trance. They don't feel like anything's particularly different. They're still aware of what's going on. They're still connected to the clinician and to the reality of the environment. Where the neuroscience has gone is into focusing on attention and attentional capabilities. And looking at the fact that people's capacity for attention differs from person to person, and that's really what people are striving to understand now. How does that capacity to focus attention foster the capacity for dissociation? Now, by dissociation the most global definition is breaking a global experience into its component parts, breaking a global experience into its component parts. So, when we take the fact that what we've learned about attention isn't that there is not one singular attention. There are multiple levels of attention happening simultaneously, multiple qualities of attention as well. And what seems to happen in hypnosis, and this is Hilgard's lasting contribution, when I say there are different models, different theoretical viewpoints, Hilgard postulated a model that is widely known and widely accepted in the hypnosis community called the neo-association model, talking about the fact that when people are in hypnosis, these normally synergistically functioning levels of awareness and information processing now have the ability to function more autonomously. So, what cognitive neuroscience has been studying that's immediately relevant to our discussion is that the phenomenon of priming. This might be something you go to Google scholar, type in the word "priming" and start learning about priming if you don't already know about it. But, priming is introducing information to someone outside their conscious awareness, and then observing their behavior to see what the possible affects are for having introduced that information, changes in their perspective, changes in their behavior. And, this is what's so fascinating about hypnosis, that you can actually suggested people that in the next moment they have a shift in cognition. That in the next moment they have a shift in sensation or a shift in perception or a shift in self definition or a shift in relational definitions. And hypnosis itself is so multidimensional, the first principle of hypnosis is what you focus on you amplify. What you focus on you amplify. So, from a clinical perspective, we're always asking the question what do you want to focus the client on and why? Do I want to focus the client on their body? Do I want to focus the client away from their body? Do I want to focus the person on their thoughts, cognitions? Do I want to focus them on their feelings? Do I want to focus them on the future, on the past, in the moment? Where do I want to focus them? And then as you start to guide this person's attention. Why do we want to do that? Here's another way of thinking about people's symptoms. How many people's symptoms arise because of inappropriate focus? Focusing on the things that work against what they're trying to accomplish. You get on an airplane and you focus on what could go wrong. You're going to have a very different experience of flying, then if you focus on how great it's going to get to be wherever you're going because you're excited to go there. How different to focus on myself when you're talking to me. I'm sorry, what did you say? Versus focusing on you while you're talking to me. Here I am in this new relationship, but I'm responding to you as if you're the person who hurt me in my last relationship, treating you as if you're the same. These are inappropriate focal points, and I can generate lots and lots of examples. And one of the most compelling reasons for doing hypnosis is how do I grab your attention and redirected to help you engage with the kinds of experience that's going to make it easier for you to do whatever it is you're trying to do? And in that respect hypnosis is goal oriented unapologetically goal oriented. Erickson famously said, "People don't come to therapy to change the past. They come to change the future." And I believe that. And the fact that his therapies were so future oriented, what's next in this person's developmental sequence? What's the next step that would represent growth in this person's life trajectory? And the fact that it's goal oriented also means that the hypnosis session that you do is only going to be as good as your goals. How well defined those goals are. How clear those goals are. And more than that, how well articulated the steps towards that goal are going to be. So again, here you have a difference in viewpoint. When you do hypnosis, should you just trust the unconscious or should you have a plan? Or can you do both? I would advocate for both. But, the idea of having an idea of what you're trying to facilitate, that there's a reason why I'm suggesting dissociation to you as a steppingstone towards the suggestions for analgesia that will help you cope with your chronic pain. There's a reason why I'm talking to you about memories before I start getting involved in helping you restructure some of yours that have been painful to you. So, the fact that hypnosis is unapologetically goal oriented for some people actually poses a problem. I can't tell you how often I've had people come up to me at workshops, always on the side never in front of the group. And, they'll say, "You know, Michael, I really like your work a lot, but you're so goal oriented." And then, they give me the little speech. "Don't you know it's not about the destination? It's about the journey." Only therapists say that. Clients never say that. Clients never walk in and say, "Hi, I'd like to go on a journey." They want symptom resolution, and they want symptom resolution yesterday. They'll settle for it today. And there are sometimes when they're expectations are definitely unrealistic, and there are other times when their expectations are entirely realistic. But, one of the interesting things that happens is that when somebody walks in and sits down and starts to tell you here's who I am, here's what's going on, here is what my life is about. And, you start making whatever assessments that you make, the idea is how do we use that information to construct a session that will be helpful to this person. And it, and there is the first major set of skills that go into the constructing hypnosis sessions. When you read about Erickson's genius, he had a plan. He had an idea of what he wanted to do. There was a reason why he was saying this. You know, for those of you that, that were at Helen Erickson's keynote last night, and she told the story about the Killah(ph) Kid. This kid's killing me. Erickson had a plan. That's what he would do. And he would then use various strategies to further the aims of the session. Now, that's what requires flexibility another set of skills that go into doing hypnosis. Now, there's nothing like you're doing a hypnotic process with somebody and this person is clearly not getting into it. Do you stay with what you're doing or do you shift? As a general principle, if what you're doing isn't working, do something else. No one from the hypnosis police is going to arrest you if you, if you get from ten to five and then decide to blow off the last five numbers. You can move into doing something else. But, what a difference in viewpoint about the way that we even think about the nature of hypnosis and hypnotic phenomenon. There are some very interesting viewpoints out there. I don't know if the name Ted Barber means anything to you. When you go to the hypnosis literature, you'll see the moniker, "T.X. Barber" routinely, a huge contributor to the hypnosis literature. And he didn't like the idea of hypnosis. When he used the word hypnosis, he would always put it in quotation marks, because he did a very ingenious set of experiments in which he was , he told people, "I'm not going to do hypnosis with you at all. But, I am going to ask you to use your imagination". And then he would ask them to imagine having an anesthesia in their hand. And guess what? And imagine being five years old again. And guess what? He was able to elicit all of the hypnotic phenomena by simply framing them as exercises and imagination. And that's what gives rise then to this question: what makes for a good induction? Well, I learned very early on, you know, Brent talked a little bit about the role of expectancy and how much expectation influences response. And of course, he's absolutely right about that. One of the predominant models of the field of hypnosis is called the socio-cognitive perspective. It has been responsible for some of the best research we have a hypnosis. Socio-cognitive perspective. And in fact, the international Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis just ran a special issue just on updating research relative to the socio-cognitive perspective. Stephen J Lynn(ph) was the editor. He's a prolific researcher from New York. And, the socio-cognitive perspective having shaped so much of our understandings about the relationship between interpersonal factors, social factors and responsiveness to hypnosis. How important is the relationship? It's all important. But, it's what gives rise to the expectations. Back when I was going through my own clinical hypnosis training, which was back in 1931, I had the opportunity to study with a very skilled clinician. I was at the University of Michigan at the time. And, one, one day I'm watching him do hypnosis, and you know, learning all these techniques. And, you know, the next thing I know I'm starting to see clients independently. He had the confidence that I could do that. And, one of the first clients if I had ever seen solo, but I had seen this guy, I don't know, three or four times. And, he was a really responsive individual. You know, it got to the point literally by the third session where my induction with them was, "You can go into hypnosis now." And that, that was all it took. And with experienced individuals, you really don't need much more than that. But over this particular weekend, before I'm seeing the sky again, Neil, the fellow that I was learning from had gone out and bought one of these rain lamps. Do you know what I'm talking about? It's like a little scene, and then there are these wires that come down. And there's a pump, and it drops down these little oil be so that it looks like it's raining. I mean, incredibly ugly. But, Neil had gone out and he had bought one of these rain lamps and put it in the office. And so, I'm seeing this guy a couple of days later, and we, we get to the point where we're going to do hypnosis in the session. And I say to him, "Okay, you can go into hypnosis now." And he sits up, and he looks at the lamp. And I said, "You can go into hypnosis now." And he's still looking at the lamp. And I say again, a little slow on the uptake, "You can go into hypnosis now." And he's still looking at the lamp. So, I asked him, "What's going on?" He says, "That's a hypnosis lamp, isn't it?" I said, "No, actually it's just a really ugly lamp that Neil bought." He said, "That the hypnosis lamp." So finally I got it. I said, "You're right. And as the drops of oil drop down, you can drop down into a very nice." That's a curious thing, because it speaks to what makes for good induction is what your client expects a good induction to be. And this is of course, one of the best reasons why it's important to have that conversation. All the things that we haven't talked about in here about how do you introduce hypnosis to someone. How do you get them on board with even wanting to do hypnosis, when so many people have so many misconceptions about it. Certainly one of the barriers to effective responding is when people hold the mythology that somehow they're going to lose control of themselves. If you thought you were going to lose control of yourselves would you want to be hypnotized? And of course, it's directly opposite that mythology what has attracted me to hypnosis all these years and kept me engaged with it all these years is how much it empowers people, the virtual opposite of what the popular mythology is. But, when you teach someone self hypnosis and you teach them how to regulate sensation in their the body, and they need to go into a clinic to have some invasive procedure that's going to be pretty unpleasant. And there they go, they dropped themselves into this wonderfully relaxed place. They direct their thoughts to whatever is going to be good for them to experience. They distort time to where this hour procedure went by in what subjectively seemed like five minutes, time distortion. When this person comes out of that clinic, they come bouncing out of there like Rocky. They feel like they can do anything. In particular for me, because so much of my professional practice is centered on treating major depressive disorder. The people who are the most disempowered people there are, who feel so hopeless about life and so helpless. To be able to introduce hypnosis to them as a way of teaching them emotional self-regulation has been enormously powerful. I was honored to be asked to serve as guest editor last year of the International Journal, first ever in their history an issue devoted to hypnosis for treating depression. So, if you're interested in that particular issue, you might want to take a look at it. So, so there's a lot to say about all of the various factors that come together to produce a meaningful hypnotic interaction. It will be so easy for people as they listen here to believe that people just go into hypnosis all the time anyway, so what's the big deal about an induction. Well, that's true, but it's not true. What a difference to spontaneously go into hypnosis because you're absorbed in something, a book, a movie, and interaction versus in a clinical context exposing yourself and your weaknesses to someone else who is attempting to help you while you're still not sure you even want help, while this person is trying to change you. Jay Haley was one of my very good friends and longtime mentors. And Jay used to talk about three different hypnoses. He didn't think about hypnosis as any single phenomenon. He thought of it as being at least three headed. So, he would talk about research hypnosis and using hypnosis as a vehicle for identifying differences between people. He would talk about meditative hypnosis, spiritual diagnosis for personal enlightenment and personal growth. And then he would talk about clinical hypnosis, using hypnosis for the purpose of changing someone. And he said very flatly that clinical hypnosis has little to no relationship with the other two forms of hypnosis. I think he's right about that to very significant extent. All right. So, let me move to the slides for a second here. We can talk about the different stages of hypnotic interaction. And of course, the rapport building, the intentional absorption, engaging with this person that's preceding even introducing hypnosis to them. But, what I'm going to obviously focus on the rest of this time then is on hypnotic induction. So, let me tell you what I have in mind. A little bit more information that I want to share with you, and then I want to stop talking about hypnosis and I want to do some. And instead of doing a one-to-one demo, I'm going to do a group hypnosis with your permission to do that. And what I'm going to do is that during that group hypnosis I'm going to model two different techniques for you. The two techniques then I'm going to crystallize here's the structure of those techniques. Here's what I just did. And then I'm going to give you a chance to split into pairs and do hypnosis with each other, doing one or both of these two techniques. The idea of running a workshop without giving you the chance to actually do hypnosis is unthinkable to me, so I want to absolutely make sure that we have time for that. So, the other phases of induction or phases of hypnotic interaction building responsiveness over time, getting people to get absorbed in the momentum that this session's going somewhere. That the session has a force that's pulling it towards achieving a specific goal. And then of course the therapy itself. What are you trying to say to this person? And when I'm doing my own hypnosis trainings, what I will tell people is before you begin a hypnosis session, it would be a good idea for you to crystallize in 25 words or less what do you want to tell this person? What's the message you want to give them? Are you trying to tell them to think in more relative terms instead of absolute black or white terms? Are you trying to tell them that they should really check their phone before they come in here? Are you trying to tell them what? What's the message, the therapeutic message? And the essence of any hypnosis session can be crystallized in that way, but here's what I most want you to understand. Here's what was it what you to learn. Here's what I most want you to experience. Posthypnotic suggestions, you know, forever hypnosis faced the criticism the results were temporary. And as it turns out, those criticisms were actually justified. What people didn't know until relatively recently was that hypnotic responses are state dependent. That they arise during the hypnosis session. So, I could do a pain management session with the client, introduce anesthesia. They report being totally pain-free during the hypnosis session. Then I bring them out of hypnosis and boom, the pain is right back again. The antidote to that is the posthypnotic suggestion. The posthypnotic suggestion is what helps the person generalize the treatment results beyond the hypnosis session. So that if you want the person to continue to be pain-free, then you need to give them suggestions that make that possible as they move through the rest of their life. And then of course, closure, bring the experience to a close and disengaging from it. So, I've answered the question why do hypnosis at all. The fact that people have these abilities, that so often they don't know they have. That you don't know you can produce an anesthesia until I create a context for you to do that. The different models that give rise to different approaches, the issue of hypnotizability. Different people respond differently, and that's the basis for the smartest part of Ericksonian work. Unlike other models of hypnosis, one of the stark contrast points is viewing hypnosis as an individual phenomenon that is going to be unique in terms of experience to the person. That's why the consideration, the phenomenology of hypnosis was so important. We don't know what's going on in this person until we ask. We're not going to get an answer from them unless we create a vehicle for them answering about what's happening in there. And this study of the phenomenology of hypnosis is one of the principal domains of hypnotic research. There are test instruments galore to measure people's responses to different hypnotic experiences. And I tell you that again is a way of reinforcing. There is a huge world of hypnosis research out there addressing these very kinds of questions. And then the final point. Is hypnosis curative. And, people are a little bit surprised sometimes when they hear me say this, but hypnosis cures nothing. Hypnosis cures nothing. It's what happens during hypnosis that has the potential to be therapeutic. That's a critically important point. The mere fact that you do hypnosis with someone, that's and four dollars will get you a latte. The mere fact that you do hypnosis isn't what's salient. What is salient is that by doing hypnosis you're creating this context where this person now has the ability to make new associations, build new subjective links, build new subjective understandings. And, that point is why hypnosis is not uniformly successful. If the power was in the hypnosis itself, you would get uniform treatment results. What you get is a variable response, because not everyone makes the links. Not everyone develops the kinds of subjective associations during hypnosis that will prove therapeutic to them. But, the fact that this person is in hypnosis, hugely increases the probability. There's something that happens in the brains of people who are in hypnosis. And, this is now becoming something measurable. Thanks to sophisticated scanning technologies, we have a better insight as to what's going on in the brains of hypnotized people. An interesting, just as an example of some pretty interesting research. Stephen Kosslyn, K-O-S-S-L-Y-N, and colleagues at Harvard University did a PET scan study. I'll just summarize the essence of that. All right, so they had people in the PET scan. They showed people a black and white figure, and they look at the part of the brain that active processing this black- and-white image. Then they show the person a color image and look at the different parts of the brain that light up as the person is observing this colored picture. All right, so we see instantly black-and- white visual processing and colored visual processing involves different parts, different regions of the brain. That's interesting. Now, they induce hypnosis in the experimental subjects. And then they say to the subjects, "We are now going to show you once again the black-and-white image." In fact, they show them the color image. Which parts of the brain light up? The black and white. The brain fooling the mind. The mind fooling the brain. Now, isn't that interesting? But the, but the fact that there's lots and lots of studies now like this showing what goes on when you suggest anesthesia to someone. And, you watch what's going on for this person neurologically. We are suggesting age regression. The difference is between saying to somebody, "I want you to remember your high school graduation." And what lights up. And then doing hypnosis and asking them to remember their high school graduation. Totally different configurations. And of course, the hypnotic version is much more pronounced, much more intense for the person. Or interestingly, put you in a PET scan or an FMRI. I give you a ball to hold and to squeeze. And I watch what's going on in your brain while you do that. Then I take the ball away from you, induce hypnosis, and then I say to you, "Once again, I'm putting the ball in your hand, and I want you to squeeze it again." Only I don't really put the ball in your hand. What does it look like on the brain scan? Same exact signature as when you are actually holding the ball. So, the fact that we're being able to look into people's brain, there is something that changes. What exactly has yet to be answered. Hypnosis has not yet been measured electrically. It has not been measured chemically. You can't look at a brain scan and say, there's hypnosis. And, I don't know that we'll ever reach that point. That's really considered the holy Grail of the field of hypnosis. But, the larger point of course is that you have this huge array this very wide array of research that's going on to help you explain the very hypnotic phenomena that we are in here studying for clinical applications. Now, having said that I'd like to invite you to arrange yourself in a position that's comfortable.

MICHAEL YAPKO And you can begin by taking in a few deep relaxing breaths. And just orient yourself now. Initially just to the idea of focusing yourself. Now, I have to believe that at some time in your life you had the experience of being well absorbed in some activity. For all I know you've had previous experiences with hypnosis. And if you have had such experiences, then it can be really valuable to focus on those experiences for a few moments. To remind yourself just what it is like to have your body grow more comfortable breath by breath. What it's like to have your thoughts slow down, breath by breath, moment by moment. Now, I don't know just when the last time was that you took the time to just sit quietly for a little while. Maybe it's been a while. Maybe it just seems like a while. I'm really providing you with an invitation, an invitation I'm extending the most respectful way that I know how. To set aside the usual. to set aside the mundane. In order to engage with yourself in a way that's easy, comfortable. And if your previous experiences help you do that, building on that foundation, that's great. But even if you haven't had previous experience with hypnosis before, there have certainly been times in your life when you've been so deeply absorbed. So deeply absorbed. And where that was, when that was, what you were doing at that time that was so absorbing for you, I really don't know. But, it's more about that ability to focus your attention at will. Just a moment ago you closed your eyes and decided that you could focus. What an extraordinary ability. Think about all the people you've worked with or known that couldn't just decide to focus. It wasn't so easy for them for a variety of reasons. That's one of the things I most appreciate about taking the time in the way that you are now. You get to discover something about your own capacity. And it might be something that you take for granted until now when I invite you to think about what an extraordinary ability it is to literally decide that you can pay close attention and paradoxically, to simply decide that you really don't have to pay attention at all. It's really powerful. To bring your focus to what's important to what's necessary at your given moment in time, to be able to maintain absorption independent of things going on around you, knowing of course that just because you decide to close your eyes and focus the world doesn't stop. There will always be people out there doing what people do. But, what a comfort to know that you can breathe, and calm, and absorbed, using these exceptional skills in an ever increasing array of ways. And, of course some people have an easier time when they remove themselves from the immediacy of an environment . Their body could be sitting in a meeting room in Phoenix while their mind goes anywhere it wants to. So, I could ask you where you would rather the right now, whether there is some special place that for you is deeply associated with comfort and well-being. Some people will remember places they have been and enjoy the memory in this moment. And other people will use their imaginations to create that special place, but isn't it curious that you can be sitting here and not sitting here. That you can be here and there. And that you can be here and here and be here and not here. And then when you discover that you forgot about your body for a while or realize that time becomes meaningless you don't know whether it's been four minutes since I invited you to close your eyes only 3 1/2 minutes. Can anybody really feel the difference between three-minute and 30 seconds and three minutes and 20 seconds? And doesn't three minutes and 10 seconds feel a lot like three minutes and five seconds? But, what a special three minutes or four minutes of comfort. And to recognize that you can create that at will, that you can literally decide to close your eyes and go inside and find the best parts of yourself, the best parts of yourself. Maybe giving them a name helps. Maybe just having a feeling about them helps. but all through this time, I've been encouraging you, strongly encouraging you, to enjoy the natural talent of using the capacity for attention. Can your mind fool your brain? Can you shift perceptions simply because you want to? Can you let go of old piece of baggage that's extraordinarily irrelevant these days. Every time that you go inside and spend time with yourself in a way that's easy and kind it allows you to remember that there it is an extraordinary richness to your internal world. Things that you haven't even discovered yet, but you will find yourself in situations that you really haven't faced much before it at all. And then you discover an ability to respond in ways that happily surprise you, and even the very way that you approach the use of hypnosis, your experience of hypnosis keeps changing as your comfort grows and as your experience intensifies over time. There's a lot to look forward to and have that sense of calm excitement. What a pleasure. And I can certainly encourage you to hold on to it. When I ask you in just a moment or two to start to reorient yourself. But, first at like you to take some time. I talked about a lot of different things over the last four minutes, and you had the opportunity to discover something of significance, and to reinforce it, strengthen it in order to bring it back with you seems like a very good thing to do. So, take whatever time you'd like to to process your thoughts, feelings, reactions, to simulate, to integrate different possibilities. And, when you've had enough time to do that, you can start the process of slowly reorienting yourself at a rate that's gradual and comfortable. So, that in a little while when you feel like you're ready to, you can re-attach to your body and to this environment slowly moving as you reconnect. And then when you'd like to, you can open your eyes and reorient yourself completely. Take your time. Take your time.

MICHAEL YAPKO Stretches and yawns. Good. Now, without looking at your watch, how long was that? Any idea? By the clock it was twenty minutes. I invited you to underestimate how much time had elapsed, so if you did that, thank you for your cooperation. Now, let's do a little bit of deconstruction there about what that was about. Let me skip through all these things. The, by the way, I just want to mention that you don't have to do hypnosis in order to do hypnosis. You look at the parallel processes. This is my newest book that just came out about eight weeks ago on the overlaps between mindfulness and hypnosis in terms of semantics and procedures. Well, this morning you did, eye fixation and counting methods with Brent. These are considered structured traditional kinds of inductions. What makes them traditional is, it's about technique. Here's the technique I'm going to do. Progressive muscle relaxation, I'm sure you all know. I'm going to name body parts while you relax those body parts. Eye fixation, counting methods. Here's the technique. The client has to find a way to adapt him or herself to that technique. What I've just demonstrated to you now are what are known as the, I'm skipping through this since Brent covered that part. But, the, the conversational inductions. at characterizes the Ericksonian approaches, there are many different characterizations, but one of the salient ones is the term naturalistic. Natural, meaning utilizing the person's subjective sense of reality. It means utilizing their history, utilizing their values, utilizing their behavior, utilizing their goals, utilizing their spontaneous responses during the course of the hypnosis session. Why it's so important when you're doing hypnosis with people that you stay focused on them. This person is your source of information. You can't utilize the flicker of tension across their face if you don't first notice it. You can't utilize and shifting in their chair if you don't first notice it. How important it is to stay observant about the person so that you can utilize all those things. The use of presuppositions. We're talking about to when you go into hypnosis, not whether. The shift in delivery style . You'll notice as I did the hypnosis with you, my voice slowed down, many more spaces in between verbalizations. What it difference to invite a verbal response from someone, hey, how you doing, as opposed to inviting an experiential response. The whole idea of slowing it down and creating space is for the person to be able to generate a experiential response, not merely an intellectual one or a verbal one. To notice and amplify their responses that you get as you see, Brent was talking about ratification this morning. That's the most straightforward way. You see this person shifted their chair. You notice and amplify it. That's right. As you shift your chair you become even more comfortable. All right, so the conversational inductions. I demonstrated these two in the course of that single session. So now what I want to do is crystallize them, give you the essence of what that approach is and some of the sample verbage to remind you of that. Unlike traditional hypnosis which can be scripted, where you can literally write out every suggestion because you're following the script. That's the problem with standardized approaches and traditional approaches is it's a scripted kind of thing. You have to use these words and the sequence. And even if you don't use the script you're still using those general verbalizations. But, if you're going to work in a more spontaneous conversational way, obviously you can script it. So, the first technique is known as accessing previous hypnotic experiences. As I start to talk to you about your previous experiences with hypnosis, as, as your therapist, for me to ask you, have you ever had any therapy before consulting me? Yes. I saw a cognitive therapist or a psychodynamic therapist or whatever. Okay. And then later you say, "I'd like to do hypnosis." They say, "I've had hypnosis before." You say, "Tell me about it." They say, "It was this wonderfully relaxing experience." Okay, we can reference that. Accessing previous hypnotic experience, making use of previous experiences. Obviously, only if previous experiences were positive. The last thing that you want to do is duplicate something that didn't work. This person tells you, "Yeah, I tried hypnosis. It didn't work." You want to ask questions like, what did this person do, and then you want to make sure you do something very different. Okay, they've already associated failure with that. You don't want to duplicate the same thing. So, in this particular case I started inviting you to think about previous hypnotic experiences that you've had, and I said, "Maybe you had formal experiences with hypnosis before, meaning they were identified as hypnosis, and you can remember how that felt and how good it felt to relax and how good it felt to have your thoughts slow down and be at peace with yourself and all those good things. Or, if you haven't had formal experience, in formal experience. That you were doing something that you were absorbed in doing. I didn't say what it was. For one person it might've been gardening. For somebody else it might've been while they were playing sports. For somebody else it might have been while they were out shopping. For somebody else it might've been laying in bed listening to music. For somebody else, don't know. It doesn't matter. Those are all content differences. But I oriented you to the process of focusing attention. And then, as I talked about using these previous experiences of being absorbed and comfortable to build upon now, that's how the technique works. Now, working one-on-one with someone you get to ask what are called accessing questions. An accessing question in a rhetorical question. You don't expect a verbal response. You expect an experiential . So, when I say to you, "Can you recall how comfortable your body felt when you were in hypnosis? Can you recall how you were sitting when you are so comfortable?" You don't expect someone to say, "Yes." You expect them to, you know, process that. But, then as they start to remember those experiences from the past, what starts to happen because of it? They start re-experiencing that, ideodynamic responses. The automatic unconscious associations to your suggestion into their own internal experience. Memories aren't just in your head. The memory you have in your head plays out physically, please out sensorially, please out emotional. These are the ideodynamic responses: ideocognition, ideoaffect, ideosensory, ideomotor. All right, so I was simply inviting you to have that experience of remembering what it was like and bringing that experience into now. And then I simply started talking to you about isn't it a remarkable skill to have, for you to simply decide you're going to go into hypnosis now. You're gonna focus yourself. You're gonna relax yourself. And, I was drawing your attention to it to be able to say I don't know if you've ever really stopped to think about what an exceptional skill that is. Think about all the people you've treated over the years who love to be able to pay attention on cue, but they can't for any of a variety of reasons. They're too anxious. They're too depressed. They're in too much physical pain. They have ADD or ADHD, anything that interrupts focus. So, I just continued on that theme for a while. But, then I introduced the second induction as a possibility, be relaxed scene experience. Content oriented means you're naming a particular place that this person can go to. Picture yourself at the beach if the content oriented approach. Process oriented is you're not naming a specific place. It's a good thing that didn't go up a little while ago. You're talking about just the process of focusing. So, when I did a process oriented version with you, I said, "Perhaps there's been some place that you have been we felt great, relaxed, and comfortable, and all those good things." Or, if you couldn't find of placing your memory, then I asked you to create one. But, if it wasn't a place that you've been, then you can certainly imagine one. Now, this happens to be one of the most commonly used techniques with people who suffer PTSD, the idea of creating a safe place for them to go to when the feelings get overwhelming. And if you do hypnosis with people who suffer PTSD, one of the things that you always wanted to is create an escape hatch in your hypnosis session, some way that they can escape if the feelings get too intense for them. Someplace where they can go and remove themselves psychologically speaking, disassociation obviously. So, in this particular case I invited you to either go to a memory of someplace special or create someplace special to go to. And then I continued on with the theme of being able to use your focus in new ways, ways that enhance you, appreciating your quality and focus , the value of being able to focus your attention at will, and how this is going to serve you in new ways as your experience with hypnosis diversifies. That was the posthypnotic gesture, closure, take whatever time you want to process all of this and integrate it, disengagement, come out of hypnosis when you're ready. Okay? All right. So, here's what I would like to do, just a very quick little practice session. Now, you can watch me do it. You can watch others do it. There's still nothing like doing it yourself. So, especially for those of you whose inclination is to run, I invite you to stay put. There will be a reward for you, a material, concrete reward that you will be given at the end for sticking through this. I promise. , here's what I would like you to do. It is now 2:20. If we take just 10 minutes each, 20 minutes, and then maybe we'll throw in an extra five minutes for discussion. Pick one of these two inductions. Just into the induction. That's all I want you to do is the induction. "Trance Works", my hypnosis textbook that contains so many of the different models and perspectives and techniques. But, here's what I want you to do. Find yourself a partner. Orient hypnosis. Do the induction. Intensify a little bit. As long as you have this person sitting in front of you, you might as well say something nice to them. So, that, that's what I mean by a theme to address. Are you going to talk to them about finding more of their personal resources? Are you going to talk to them about learning hypnosis more easily? Are you going to talk to them about becoming more creative? Think of something nice to say to this person as long as they're sitting there focused, listening to you. All right? Keep your eye on the clock. 10 minutes. Talk about it. Switch. And then we'll regroup. I will pull us back together exactly at 2:45. All right? Have a good time.

MICHAEL YAPKO You all look so much more relaxed now. That's good. How'd you do? The G2 okay? Easier or harder then you thoughts? Some easier, some harder. This is where many of you who are entirely American, discover English as a second language. Not quite sure what to say there. But, here's what happens when you end up mastering the principles of utilization. It means whatever's happening, you can make that part of the deal, whether it's external distractions and noises or even not being quite sure what you want to say. Steve mentioned in passing the term "trance logic" which is the seminal contribution of the late psychiatrist Martin Orne, O-R-N-E, whose work you should also be familiar with. The idea that you can assimilate and respond meaningfully two things that make no logical sense. So, you get to say things to people like, well, let me back up with something. You're doing this wonderful imagery. You're taking this person through the forest, and they see all the trees, and they see the sunlight filtering through the leaves, and they hear the squirrels running up the bark of the trees, and then they come out of the forest into this beautiful meadow. Tall grass waving in the wind. And as they're walking through the meadow, they come upon an escalator that takes them even deeper into the experience. The person in hypnosis never sits up and says, "Excuse me, uh, why is there an escalator in the meadow?" That's trance logic. You say there's an escalator in the meadow, and they go, cool. And they are, they're just with it. But, it's why you get to say things like, "I may speak with a thick accent, but you can understand me clearly. I may be speaking too quickly, but that's okay, you can listen slowly. It doesn't make logical sense, but in hypnosis it doesn't have to. And, that's one of the great strengths of hypnosis. You're only limited by your own creativity. You get to say things and do things that don't make logical sense necessarily. Will look, I left just a few minutes here at the end for a couple of questions if there are any. Go to, work your way to the microphone. I'll take a couple of questions, but then I've got a few last comments that I want to make, and then I want to give you something. Are there any questions? Anyone want to get over to the microphone? Go ahead. 

03:53:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. I really enjoyed it so far. 

03:53:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. 

03:53:30
UNKNOWN I'm pretty new to hypnosis, but to a lot of mindfulness. And I noticed that you were talking about the commonalities of those things, but one of the things I was reflecting on was one of the differences that feeling a little hard for me to get my head around, which is what you talked about in the beginning of what you amplify: what you talk about you amplify. 

03:53:50
MICHAEL YAPKO What you focus on you amplify. 

03:53:50
UNKNOWN What you focus on you amplify, uh, which seems a little different then my experience of mindfulness anyway, which is more that,uh, trying to really be present to what you're focusing on and really let it, notice it and let it be a part of you. 

03:54:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Following the suggestion to do what? To focus on whatever comes up. 

03:54:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:54:15
MICHAEL YAPKO That's the point. You could have a laser focus or a wide angle focus. Mindfulness uses the white angle focus on whatever comes up. Hypnosis is focused on this. Structurally, those are identical. Focus. What changes is the content of whether you're focusing on something very specific or something very broad. Something structured or something spontaneous. But, they both heavily involved suggestions for guiding attention. Now, where were going to differ is attention to what? And part of what I talk about in the book is that there are certain aspects of mindfulness that are actually pretty self deceptive. You know, the idea of attention without intention. That's a great concept theoretically, but here's the difference between spiritual practice and clinical practice. The, the, practice of mindfulness meditation comes out of the Buddhist tradition, 2500 years and all that. But, as soon as you move it into the clinical arena, it totally changes its qualities, changes its focus, changes its intentions. Would this person ever have, to an integrative medicine center and be taught mindfulness if they weren't struggling with cancer or some other illness? There's an agenda. As soon as you say, here, I'm going to teach mindfulness cuz I think it will make a difference. It will help you. Boom. There, there's the goal. So, even though the philosophy is attention without intention, in fact, it's still attention with intention. And, that's why I point out the synaptic overlaps, the neurological overlaps, the relationship overlaps, the goal overlaps between mindfulness and hypnosis. But, if I say focus on the past, focus on the future, those are just content differences. I'm still using the process of focusing. I'm just changing what I encourage you to focus on. Thanks for your question. Yes, sir. 

03:56:35
UNKNOWN Total comment. Uh, during your induction, the one that you did, I had a couple of things that were going on. And, I couldn't hear you quite as well, and it almost didn't matter that I couldn't hear you. It worked. 

03:56:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, let me show you something. How many of you had the experience of fading in and out during that hypnosis session? Feel better now? 

03:57:00
UNKNOWN Yeah! Oh my gawd! I can't hear, but it worked. 

03:57:05
MICHAEL YAPKO See, here's the dissociation, one of the manifestations of dissociation. Again, one of the things that's so interesting about hypnosis, part of you is in the experience, part of you is watching yourself go through the experience. Part of you is connected to what I'm saying, part of you drift off and is totally disconnected. And this is what gives rise to some of the spontaneous hypnotic phenomena like amnesia, so that if I ask you, "Okay, I talked for 20 minutes nonstop. What did I talk about?" How many of you now realize you remember very little about the experience? Again, look around. Now, that's interesting because one of the thinks that we don't really get yet is why the person can come out of hypnosis, developed a spontaneous amnesia for what the content of the session was, and there's a certain percentage of people who will then come back for next week's session, and they'll say to you, "You know, Wednesday night I was at the grocery store. I don't know why, but I started thinking about ABC, and then I started thinking about DEF. and then it occurred to me that GHI. And I realized JKL." And I mean Word for Word, that's what you said to them that hypnosis. But, they don't attribute it to you. They have source amnesia for it. But, it was still in there rolling around and influencing their experience. Now, when people say trust your unconscious, that's an overstatement, because clearly there are some people who will come back a week later and they'll say, "I was in the grocery store, and here it all is." And the other people that come back a week later and you say, "So, did you notice anything different this week?" And they go, "No." Do you remember anything we talked about last week? And they go, "Did I see you last week?" It's just gone. And it, it's that that's one of the things that's so interesting to me. How is it that one person can have amnesia for the experience and have absorbed all of these ideas and possibilities. What is it about the way this person is processing? How is this person neurologically wired differently, socially wired differently, personality wise wired differently than this person for whom they have amnesia for the experience and then it's just gone. And that's one of the ways diagnostically vary your approach is when you learn something about which kind of person you're dealing with. Now, just in case you're interested, I mentioned the name Ted Barber,T.X. Barber earlier. And it's really one of his great contributions to the field that he described different personality types and how they respond to hypnosis. And one he called the amnesia prone personality. One he called the fantasy prone personality. And then differential responses to hypnosis. It's interesting stuff. Anyway, it relates to that whole point, but now you discover this is what's normal for people in hypnosis. They're, they're processing things on all different levels. Sometimes are connected, sometimes they're not. It's why you can't just say to somebody, "Go deeper, go deeper, go deeper, go deeper." Because they're always fluctuating. They're not into it. They're into this. There and to that. They're thinking about this. They're thinking about who they have to call when they get home. 

04:00:45
UNKNOWN Well, your comment actually supports creativity also, because as doing this, I don't do it that much, I have been through a, a basic hypnosis program earlier, just going through the track this time. I know that when I've worked with patients, I don't do it that often my practice, I find myself so attached with what am I saying and how my saying it and that sort of thing. And this suggests to let go. 

04:01:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, that would be a good suggestion to take, and it, it doesn't mean, you know, don't have a plan. But, it also means as long as you have the gist of what you want to say to someone, you're, you're up and running. 

04:01:30
UNKNOWN And then the other thing I noticed during the practice, there was so much noise initially, and it was really remarkable, because it just totally fell off. And, I have never had that happen in any other practice of this sort. It's quite... 

04:01:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, that's what's clinically termed cool. 

04:01:50
UNKNOWN I didn't notice it. 

04:01:50
MICHAEL YAPKO It's clinically termed cool, when that happens. Thanks for that. Ma'am? 

04:02:00
UNKNOWN I just have a comment about knowing and not knowing what, what for me, this is an example of behavior that I noticed and may be was more aware of it because of coming to these kind of conferences. And, it's, it's just, it's not in a hypnosis place. So, my mother calls, this is years ago. Things went well, but she calls and says I have a lump in my breast. What should I do? And, as a physician I said, "Well, I'll come over and check it out tonight." And so I come over and check it out tonight, and I say, "This lump needs to have a biopsy." Fast forward a week or so. I happen to be in the office with the surgeon as he's getting his pile of lab results back. And he's flipping through them. He's not known for his bedside manner, but he just hands over the piece of paper and says, "Oh, this is your mother's lab results." And I read it, and I go, my mother has cancer. And my little fingertips, not literally, but they say you knew she had cancer. You knew she had cancer. How could you know she had cancer when I didn't know she had cancer? Well, where doctors fingers. We know these things. We felt cancer before. And I go, "That's sort of weird. How can I know and not know at the same time?" And, there's other examples of that, but I think that's, that's not within a hypnosis framework, but it's part of being human. 

04:03:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And, that's the point. These things that happen in hypnosis, these various hypnosis phenomenon like dissociation and age regression and age progression and all those things, these are the building blocks of life experience, whether for better or for worse. And what we're doing with hypnosis is where crystallizing them and mobilizing them in very specific ways, but none of these are outside the norm of everyday life. You have the discipline as a physician to know that your fingers may be accurate and they may not be accurate and let's wait until we have the lab response. You know, which is a smart thing to do. Well, let me tell you about a couple of things that I want to share with you. The, uh, hypnosis trainings that I'll be doing in San Diego and Calgary in this coming year if you get out to take the one table, you'll see a card that looks like this. I hope you'll consider pursuing a comprehensive training. Another opportunity as this one. Uh, the, the whole idea for me is to get people exposed to the leaders of the field across models. So, you'll see we've got the Ericksonian model represented. Jeff has participated in this. Ernie Ross has participated in this. The Barettas(ph), Maggie, you know, Caroline. We've got a few people, but also the researchers. People like Steve Lynn and David Spiegel who are doing some of the neuroscience and some of the social science of hypnosis. So, I'm going to do a free overview of the webinar on January 12, but this you can do from anywhere. It's just plug in your computer, and then if you're intrigued by, hopefully you'll be interested in listening to what all these different people have to say as I have conversations with them. Well, you have all been wonderful all afternoon, and I feel compelled to reward that. This is a DVD called "The Case of Vicki". This is a hypnosis session I did with the woman with terminal cancer. She's 42 years old, and she just found out she's going to die soon. It is as dramatic a session as there is. She's asked me for pain relief. She doesn't want to spend the last weeks of her life doped out on pain medications, so she asks whether she can have a hypnosis session to learn pain management. And as you hear, her story is exceptionally compelling because of a psychiatric history that she has long since resolved. She's, she's great. She's in graduate school now. Ironically, first pulling her life together as she loses her life. And, she complains bitterly about the fact that she would go to doctors and say, "I know there's something wrong with me." Her file with procedure, and they dismiss her as a hypochondriac. And, it ends up costing her her life literally. By the time she is diagnosed, it's too late. So, it's a very dramatic session. This session is also transcribed with commentary and analysis in the book, "Trance Work", hypnosis textbook. But, because you were all new to hypnosis and certainly new to me, because you could great this afternoon, every one of you it's going to get a copy of this DDT on your way out the door. Thank you. So, thank you. And, I think you'll find it particularly instructive, because it also includes explanatory subtitles so that you get a sense of why I'm saying what I'm saying when I'm saying it. So, thank you so much for coming this afternoon everyone. Make sure you get your DVD. Thank you. Thank you. 

04:07:15
Dan Short Ph.D. 

04:07:15
DAN SHORT And welcome, everyone. Uh, if it's all right, we have some more folks trickling in. Just find your way, uh, to where you can sit, and be as comfortable as possible. Some of you have been here since early morning. So, you're getting used to this space, right? I'm curious for my own knowledge, how many people have been, are doing this track, and have been for all the different presentations? Wonderful. This is excellent. So, whenever I reference something that was said earlier today, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I think this is a marvelous training opportunity, and to be able to see things from different perspectives so that you can pull together in your own mind a more sophisticated understanding of what hypnosis is. It's a really valuable opportunity. Uh, like Michael just said, hypnosis is a little bit of a Rorschach inkblot in that they can be ambiguous, and so you'll have a lot of different projections and different ways of explaining it. As has been the case this morning and will be the case right now, I'll use a slightly different analogy and metaphor to describe hypnosis from what the others have. But, we're all talking about the same thing, sort of like that idea of individuals describing the elephant. And they're standing of different positions. The more perspectives you hear, the better equipped you are to gain an understanding of this that in some ways defies words. And that's also what the experiential opportunities will provide for you. There's an understanding of how to do this that in some ways defies words, and is based on your own experience. Now, uh, we've already, uh, heard how, what essentially we're trying to do with hypnosis and how to do hypnotic inductions. I want to pick up with that and talk about during hypnosis, how are you talking to the person. So, the assumption is that the person is now in a trance. And and then we're speaking to them. But, what I would like to suggest is that it's important not to get too hung up on this idea of trance or whether or not the person's not all the way in, or are they deep enough, or they may be just sitting there with their eyes closed, but they're not really in trance. Or their eyes are open that were talking but they're in trance and they just don't look like they're in trance. I would suggest to you that that's a little bit of a diversion. And, if you'll just develop an appreciation for using the language of hypnosis, you'll find that it works very well and it works at the pace at which the individual is ready for it. Now, one more sort of housekeeping thing. I don't have breaks built into this. You know, our breaks are in between presentations, so I'll, I'll expect everyone to just take care of themselves, take care of their needs. Do what you can to make yourself comfortable during this experience. I believe I myself going to take off my shoes. If you're not sure what to make of that or what that means, you can come back to my presentation on Sunday and where we'll talk about permissive suggestion. In the meantime, there is a metaphor that I'm going to suggest to you that you can use while thinking of hypnosis, and it'll help makes sense of the information I'm giving you right now. And you've heard it said that Erickson often said that the unconscious thought mind is intelligent. What did he mean by that statement? Has anybody ever had it explained to them what Erickson meant when he said the unconscious mind has its own intelligence? Does anybody know? Let me explain it to you, because it's very important for what we're doing. When he said that he would go on to say that individuals without conscious awareness will systematically work to get themselves from point A to point B to achieve certain agendas, to make certain things happen. People without conscious awareness will problem solve. People without conscious awareness will make adjustment to their conscious plans based on unconscious knowledge. People will make decisions and choices based on unconscious knowledge, reasoning and understanding, without conscious knowledge of it. That is what Erickson meant. He would give lots of different anecdotal examples to explain that. How people will make little adjustments. One he gave was when him and a colleague were going to give a presentation on a woman who had some type of sexual disorder. I believe she was involved in all kinds of deviant sexual behavior. And they, at the staffing, the man had been very convinced he wanted opinions of other people in the staffing. And then they left, and the man didn't bring up this case. And so, Erickson went to him and said, "Do you know why you didn't bring up this case, cuz you've been waiting for several days to bring it to staffing and get other people's opinions?" He said, "I don't know. I don't know why I didn't bring it up. I guess I just forgot." And Erickson said, "Did you notice who was in the staffing this morning? Did you notice who was in the staffing who's not normally in our staff meetings?" And the man's face lit up and he said, "There was a priest there." He said, "Exactly. Would you feel comfortable talking about this kind of thing in front of a priest?" He said, "No, heavens no." That's not an exact quote, but it was something along those lines. So, Erickson attributed that to problem solving conducted at unconscious levels. Lo and behold, now we have researchers starting in the late 90s that have figured out how to do research on unconscious reasoning. And they have documented that it does exist. Unconscious problem-solving does exist. Unconscious planning and manipulation of the environment does exist. You can measure it. You can make predictions on it. Unconscious attitudes exist, and they can be contradictory to your conscious attitudes. And you don't know it. There's many individuals out there, hopefully not any in this audience, because it's a very debilitating thing, but there are many individuals who have very high explicit self-esteem in terms of their conscious awareness. And their value, their feelings, their opinions of themselves is very high. And they're implicit self-esteem is exceedingly low, dangerously low. But, it's unconscious. And when you've got that kind of a split in someone's general attitude towards themselves, and you get some really weird behavior. You get a lot of bragging. You get a lot of grandiosity. You get a lot of trying to prove themselves. You get a lot of them putting themselves down on others, putting themselves up at others expense. You get a lot of narcissistic behaviors essentially. It comes from the split. You can literally, researchers can now measure that and predict when it's there and particular behaviors. And lo and behold, there they are. So, there's also lots of other types of science now that in neuroscience support this idea that the unconscious is intelligent. So, a metaphor I'm going to suggest to you that'll help you as you're thinking about talking, well, one more statement. None of us, most of us, hopefully none of us in this room would walk up to a brick and start talking to it or start trying to reason with it. Or you don't, you don't turn to the wind, unless you're doing kind of a mystic spiritual kind of thing, but you don't turn to the wind and try to reason with the wind or persuade the wind, because the wind doesn't have intelligence. The rock doesn't have intelligence. We don't talk to things that don't have intelligence. Very early on this morning when Brent was talking to us about what hypnosis is essentially, he summed it all up by saying it's essentially persuasive communication. Just a different form of persuasive communication. Well, what I want to suggest to you is that we may be talking to different parts of the brain when you're using regular dialogue like I'm using now, and when you switch to hypnotic dialogue you're accessing a different part of the brain. The metaphor of going to give you, I call it, I keep calling it metaphor because it's a, it's not a perfect statement. Things aren't, it's a little bit of a oversimplification of how the brain works, but it's a useful oversimplification. Just the same thing as if I were telling you how to get to the beach from this room. I could tell you to go West. If you go West, you'll get to the beach, and that's true. However, it's much more complex of that. You can't just always go West. You run into ditches and walls and buildings and all kinds of things. The actual path you would follow is actually much more complex. But, the general idea is correct. You go West to get the beach. So, generally speaking, we have in our brains, most of us, two hemispheres, left and right. And, for at least 94 to 97 percent of the population, the left brain has certain qualities to it in terms of its reasoning and its intelligence, and the right brain has certain abilities, capabilities, ways of functioning. They both have apparently are capable of reason. It's as if we've got to control centers inside of us or two people driving us. That's why we get such funny behavior of people. To give you a really, a dramatic example of this, you look at individuals who have had some sort of either brain damage or they've had their brains altered surgically. Some cases with severe epilepsy to help the person stop with the severe seizures, they'll go in and cut the corpus callosum, which allows left and right to communicate with one another. And some really strange things happen when you have that happen. We have a, a cross lateralization, so that the right brain controls the left-hand. And so, there's an example, a documented example of a man who would become angry at his wife and was physically trying to beat her up with his right He had no conscious awareness of what was going on though, so desperately, left and/right brain, with this hand, the right hand, he was trying to stop it. This hand is controlled by the left hemisphere. He intellectually knew it was against his value system and his beliefs. He didn't want to hurt his wife, and he was trying to stop himself. So this man went on with the struggle. With one hand, he's trying to beat her up. And the other hand is trying to protect his wife. He could feel the anger. He didn't know what was driving him at emotional levels. The anger was not able to be tempered by his beliefs and values, his intellectual understanding of what was happening. The two parts of the brain were able to communicate with one another. So, uh, I don't know if you can even see those tiny itsy-bity words there, but the, the purple side of the brain is what we're going to be interested in when we are talking to an individual. And I'm going to suggest that you can talk to that side of the brain in a persuasive way, just the way you would talk to someone as if you were involved in a debate, or you wanted to convince them when they went to the store, you know, this would be the such and such product that they should purchase. To convince people we don't need to take control of them. We don't need to force things on them. It's actually not a wise way of going about it. So, rather you just simply talk to the person in a way that's persuasive. The left brain, the analytical part of the mind, uh, or that supplies the analytical part of the mind, likes to think in terms of logic, sequence, analysis very fact driven, very language oriented. But, in its use of language it looks at sentences. It seeks to make sense of sentences. It's very goal oriented. Uh, the right brain works different than that. The right brain will listen to, uh, language, and it processes language but not at a level of conscious awareness. While the right hemisphere is doing its work, you don't think about it the same way you would think about what's happening the left hemisphere. Sometimes you'll feel it. You might feel it in your body, but it's a difficult for the thoughts to become conscious to you. I'll give you an example of this. I had a woman that came to me in utter, utter distress. Good reason to. Her husband was in the hospital essentially in critical care. He had to be flown there in a helicopter on life flight. His heart was failing him and it looked like he could die at any moment. And the doctors were just wanting to keep them calm and sedate. She realized that while on their little trip before you have the heart failure, he had put their wad of money that they were using for their vacation, a large wad of cash, in the hotel room drawer. She had grabbed it. She had this large wad of cash, and had become very frightened at losing it or someone stealing it. Now, she's at home alone, so she hides it. She hides it so someone will come in and get it. Well, now she realizes she can't find it. And, her husband's in the hospital. He can't have any stressful things said to him or something, but she's lost $900 or whatever it was. It was for them an extraordinarily large amount of money. And, she came to me in an absolute panic. The last five days she'd spent morning to evening taking every cup out of the cupboard, taking every cushion of the couch, and was trying to find this money. And was convinced that if she had to go and tell him she lost the money it would kill him. She would've killed her husband. And she was crying, and she said, "Dr. Short, you've just got to help me. You got to help me find this." I said, "All right. We'll use hypnosis. And, we'll see if we can't get that memory back of where you hid it, using hypnosis." So, I did my very best job of easing her in, using some induction technique similar to what we used in here. And I spoke to her in a way that I'll teach you about in here today. And, had her kind of regress to the past, all the way from the hotel room and the helicopter ride, and going to her house, and realizing the horrible responsibility of having this money, and of hiding it. Allowing herself to see the whole thing. And now she could see that money was where it's at. And then I wake her up from trance, and I'm waiting there to see which she says. She opens her eyes, and she says, "It didn't work." I said, "You didn't see anything?" She said, "I, I saw everything you were saying up until the point where I hid it somewhere." I said, "You didn't see anything at all?" And she said, "All I saw was between. This word came to me, between." I thought, that's all right. I said, "That's all right. Your mind knows where it is. A part of your brain has that memory. And you already know where it is right now. I'm going to tell you how to figure it out. You're going to be at home. I don't know if it's going to be tonight, tomorrow night, sometime this week. You're going to be at home watching TV or something, and you're going to suddenly get the urge to go somewhere. And you may not even know exactly where it is you're trying to go. Do not ignore it. Get up, go in that direction. And, even if you don't know the endpoint, let your body tell you what it feels like doing, and just keep doing it. And then you'll get the rest of the information on where your money's at." And so she comes back a week later beaming, just glowing. I said, "You found your money?" She said, "It worked just like you said." She said, "It was the strangest thing. I was sitting there in the living room watching the evening show," that her and her husband always watched. And she said, "I never miss this show, and I never leave this show. But, suddenly in the middle of the show I got the idea that I should take a bath. And I thought to myself, what the heck? I always take my baths in the morning, and here it is 5:30. But, I remembered what you said, so I went up, and I went to my bedroom where I have my shower you see, and I went to the door, and my bathroom is to the left. But, my body wanted to go to the right." And she said, "I thought, how am I going to take a shower. The only thing over there is my dresser. And I went to my dresser, and I thought, "Well Dr. Short's wrong here, because I've already gone through every drawer in this dresser. The money can't be in it." But she said, "I just looked at it. I wanted to look at this side of it, and there's three drawers. And I looked at the one in between. And it's where I keep my hoses. But, I'd already gone through those hoses, but anyway I opened it up and there's three rows. And I looked at the one that was in between, and then I looked at that row, and I looked at the stocking exactly in the middle of that row, and I reached down and started squeezing it with my hand. And that money was wrapped up inside the stocking. That's why I couldn't find it before." So, it seems that her brain really knew all along, but there's a certain way of accessing the unconscious. And by the way, the things I'm going to start telling you right now overlap with research that's been done in neuroscience and with, uh, victims of brain damage and with researchers that are now doing research on the unconscious mind and how it works. P op Using really clever devices to measure unconscious thinking and reasoning, and it overlaps with what Erickson's been telling us all along, uh, that the unconscious thought is responsive to imagery, metaphor, storytelling, body sensation, spatial relations, implied meaning, and emotional meaning. This is the stuff of the unconscious mind. So, when I was talking to you earlier about that story, maybe some of you would consider yourself in a trance, maybe none of you were in a trance. Maybe you saw images of what I was describing. You saw the woman's face. Maybe, none of you saw it. Maybe some of you went back in time to where you've lost something. Maybe some of you went forward in time to when you might lose something. You thought, "Now I know how to find things. This is cool." A lot of that stuff that was happening is going to be you're right brain becoming more active, right hemisphere, unless you're one of these unique individuals who has them reversed. But, for most of us the right hemisphere works this way. Doesn't matter that you were in trance or out of trance. You know, does the right hemisphere only work when the left hemisphere is completely turned off? I doubt so. Actually, I believe that we are at our prime when we have both hemispheres working, and we have communication between the two of them. Kind of like two parents, when they are willing to talk to each other as a parent to child, versus unwilling to talk to each other in parenting the child. And the child is going what is going on with you two people? You're telling me opposite things. How do I make sense of this? Some people get crosswise within their own brain. What we're doing in therapy is trying to access the resources that exist within both sides of their brain. Right now, I'm making every effort to appeal to the left hemisphere a, to give logical coherent explanation of this stuff. When I was telling the story I was talking to a different part of your brain. These different parts of the brain have different advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages of unconscious thought, it's highly intuitive, it's very fast. We had the, uh, I forget the fellow's name, but that blink, where you start summarizing a lot of the emerging research on unconscious decision-making and how fast it can be. It's mostly automatic. Provides an emotional context of conscious thought. Let me say a little bit about what I,I mean by that. When you have individuals who come into your office, and they've learned to suppress their emotions. Maybe they grew up in an alcoholic family, and so they learned very early on not to feel, right? In order not to feel, you need to, uh, not have your right hemisphere communicating with your left hemisphere. You need to have the part of your brain that's most closed, the right hemisphere a little more closely connected to the amygdala, where you have all these emotions, you know, the seat of emotions, right? You need that part of your brain not passing information along to the part of your brain that mostly holds conscious awareness, the left hemisphere. When a person shuts off that part of the brain, they lose a lot of the other functions that go along with that part the brain. It's our right hemisphere that's also responsible for body awareness, for autobiographical memory. I like to do an assessment of whether or not someone's chronically suppressing emotions or just staying in their left hemisphere without using the other parts of the brain. It can be done very quickly. I can learn a lot about a person by asking one question. Tell me a little bit about your childhood. It was great. Oh, doesn't sound good. That doesn't sound good. How are your parents? You know, they were regular parents. They were great. Po p So, now you start letting the person know how uncomfortable therapy can be. You asked them what was your most painful memory from childhood? The person doesn't say anything. What was your happiest moment from childhood? What was your favorite birthday? And then they get more honest with you. Well, to tell you the truth, I don't remember much before high school. Can you remember being seven? Not really. Eight, nine? No. Are you willing to get some of those memories that? I don't know about that. Because they did not have an autobiographical memory, I know right brain's not communicating so well with left brain. I also know they are gonna, they tend to suppress emotions chronically. That means their decision-making is not going to be informed by emotional awareness. It means it's going to have a hard time. That person is going to have a hard time knowing what their felt needs are. They could be scared of something, but they won't know. They could be lonely and not know. They could be a horribly lonely individual and about to leave their spouse and go off to have an affair or whatnot, and be about to leave the one person who is their best shot at being known by someone else and has been willing to stay with them and provide them with what they need. But, they're not aware of those needs. They don't know their own needs. You can't without emotional awareness. Right? So, emotional awareness is like a confidence. It provides a context for knowing, for the, the logical part of our brain, part of our brain that;\'s making all these complex decisions and analysis. It needs that. Uh, other advantages of unconscious thought. Processes massive amounts of information before arriving at summary judgment. Your unconscious mind, if you let it, will give you answers that span a lifetime of experience. Thus, I think that's why Erickson was so fond of orienting clients towards trusting their unconscious and orienting practitioners. But, something he also used to say was that the unconscious mind doesn't like to be bullied around. So, when you're doing self hypnosis, you don't sit down and tell yourself, now answer these questions. It doesn't work that way, especially if the questions are complex. You're going to need some time. While you sleep, and as you do things during the day, that part of the brain will be working on an answer, and it will give it to you. I'll give you an example of this. My sister called me one time when I was at work, one of the few times she asked me for advice. She must've really been disturbed by this thing. She's a social worker, and she called me up and she said, "Dan, p op I need your advice." And I said, "All right." And she said, "I'm in a situation here where there's a, a custody thing going on. There's a small, darling, little boy that I really don't want to make a bad decision. I want him to have a good life. He's got a foster family that's fallen in love with him. They want to adopt him. I've met the foster family. They have money. They can put him through college. They have great parenting skills. They can give them a dog. They can send them to, they can help him travel around the world. They can give him a life kids dream of. And they adore him. But, his birth parents are fighting to keep custody of him. They, the evidence seems to suggest that they've learned what they need to learn to no longer be abusive. They seem very dedicated to trying to get your child back. They're uneducated people. They do not have much money. They don't have any strong spiritual leanings. But, they love their boy. The judge has come to me in his own chambers and said it's my call." And, she said, "What do I do? "Well," I said, "That's simple." I said, "This is a choice you make using unconscious reasoning processes rather than conscious reasoning processes. There are some things that are too complicated, too complex, and have too many variables to use conscious decision-making on. We have research to back this up, yada yada yada. You know, if you're going to the store and you're trying to decide the best soup to buy, the great thing for conscious decision-making. But, this one's so complex you let your unconscious mind give you the answer." And, she said, "How do I do that?" I said, "It will probably come to you in a dream or." No, I think I said, "First it will come to you like, throughout the day. You'll see something and that will mean something to you and stir something up and you. Or, in the night it will come to you as a dream. You'll sit bolt upright, bolt upright in bed at 3:30 in the morning and you'll suddenly have your answer, and you'll know this is what he needs." And, there was a long silence on the phone. And I kind of thought I'd lost the connection, but then she said, she finally said, "It's already happened. It was 2:30 not 3:30." And I said, "What did your unconscious mind tell you?" She said, "My unconscious mind tells me, told me that a boy needs connection to his roots. He needs to know where he came from. He needs to be with his mother and his father." Okay, so, you know, I'm not here to argue which, politically speaking, which decision would've been best or not. But, that was her brain doing its very best. And, uh, and that was her relying on, she couldn't tell you, while she did kind of explain it. But, when the answer cane to her, she couldn't tell you how she got the answer. It came from the unconscious reasoning process. So, we're here to learn how to talk to the unconscious mind, and, uh, contrary to what I was just doing, when you're working with the client and you want to access the right hemisphere, you speak much more slowly. It's what Michael did when he started using his hypnotic voice. It's what Ericsson did almost every time he spoke to someone. The cadence of his voice was so slow it's what Mr. Rogers did on TV. with all these hypnotized kids out there in the audience. I once listened to an interview of Mr. Rogers by Diane Rehm. I nearly wrecked my car. An interesting thing happens when you talk slowly though, your thoughts tend to be a little more well thought out. I think in some ways we, we take away from our own wisdom and the profoundness of what we have to communicate by rushing ourselves. Or rushing our clients. These are real simple guidelines I'm giving you. They're in your handouts. On the Internet, your world just got broader. There's these handouts on the Erickson Congress website, and they will be mine. I know they're easy to find because someone's already told me that. He said he had a hard time finding the other one, but mind just keeps popping out at him somehow. It's just two pages, and it's going to summarize all these points I'm making. And, if you feel completely overwhelmed by all this amazing information you're getting, don't worry about it. You know, and just look at some of the basics and just stay in there with the basics. I saw some people out here that were real nervous to do hypnotic induction and were afraid maybe they were going to blow it or something. Well, don't worry about that. You don't even have to do the induction, just, just talk to different parts of the client's brain, and you'll have a different effect on the mind. One of my favorite, you know, I used to do the Milton Erickson Foundation newsletter, and I get to interview all these really wonderful people, and I'd ask them questions. One of my favorite, one of the things I asked Yvonne Nolan(ph) once, "What's your most important therapeutic guideline or what not. What's the most important thing you've learned as a therapist?" And she said, "I can sum it up in one statement. Bite my lip. There's been so many times when I just wanted to dive in and say something, and I literally just bit my lip so I wouldn't talk. And just let there be silence. And it's amazing what the clients fill it with." So, I started using her technique. And so I would bite my tongue so the client can't see. You can see the lip biting, but you can't see me biting my tongue. I try to hold myself still for a second, and even if the client asked me a question, you know, what should I do? And I'd just sit there. And they look down, and they say, "You know, even as I asked you that question, I'm hearing my own answer." And I say, "What is the answer you're hearing?" And they tell me. And they say, "Is that the right answer?" And I say, "It is so profound. You are so right on." And in my mind, I'm thinking that's better than I would've thought. I'm glad I stayed quiet. That's a good answer. Timing of progress. Eventually, don't rush clients. You know, were so nervous and insecure and we need to see their eyes closed so that we know we really did hypnosis right. Were not failures as therapists and as a person. It's okay if they take a long time. Whenever I use hand levitation, it usually takes about 20 minutes before the person starts to move their hand up. So, for 20 minutes I'm sitting there going yes, yes, that's it, that's it. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Then after about 20 minutes, you think, "Oh my gosh, I just have to admit failure, you know". This is just, and then the hand just starts going up, and it goes up, up, up. It happened just last week, and I thought, "Wow, wow." And the person goes into this trance. And, sometimes, you know, the, the posthypnotic suggestion maybe for this week that you'll find the money or something. And the widow comes back to you, and she still can't find the money. And you say, "That's all right. Your unconscious mind is trying to teach you something here too. You don't have to tell your husband. He's not thinking about the money right now. It's just you and I that are worried about it. Your unconscious mind is trying to teach you to believe in yourself. Let's give it another week. Or a month from now or a year from now or three years from now. I like to, I like to give statements to my children when they're, when they really think they're going to be rebellious. I'll make a statement something along the lines of, "Daddy wants you to go to your room, and you will go to your room." Right? Because, what are they going to do? Are they going to stay out of their room for the rest of their lives? How can they never again go in their room? You will go to sleep. Now, they may not go to sleep at 8:30 what I wanted. It may be 11:30 or whatever, right? They are laying in bed. I can't sleep. I can't sleep. But, you will go to sleep. I don't get rushed about it, because then I become controlling. When I say jump, you will jump. You will say, "How high, Sir?" Right? When you get really demanding in terms of time and that people respond on your schedule, you've got an issue with control, and that's going to come across to your clients. You're going to create resistance in them. You're going to make them feel like they're failing, because they're not doing things according to your time schedule. I would avoid that. All right, so we're going to try an exercise right quick. It's called the 5-2 second exercise. What you're going to do is you're going to interview a partner about a transformational event. Try to find out why the event was meaningful, but do not directly ask, do not ask directly why with this meaningful. That's cheating. So, uh, the operator, the one interviewing is to wait five seconds before replying to the subjects statements. So, it would be like this. So, tell me what's on your mind right now. 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005. Is there anything that comes to mind? 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005. Perhaps there's just a tranquil sea inside there. Okay. So, uh, while you are talking, wait five seconds in between your statements. It's amazing how much you can think about in five seconds. That's really an interesting exercise. When they speak to you, pause for two seconds before you respond to their statement. So, they say something like what are you asking me? And in your head go 1001, 1002. I'm asking, you know, okay? So, uh, look for associations. The, the right hemisphere doesn't work, someone was giving us a nice example of how something can be true and untrue at the same time. Was it Steve Gilligan? Someone was talking about how the unconscious mind works differently. And, oh, the man with the mustache. And he was a little boy at the same time that he was a grown man. What that is, is that the right hemisphere is not sequential. The left hemisphere knows that your first a little boy, then with time passing you become. The left hemisphere knows beginning and end. That's part of why with PTSD, you have this emotional responding, because the right hemisphere doesn't know when it happened or that it's over. right? Because it's, it's, you have that breakdown between right and left hemisphere, where the left hemisphere can say "It's over, and you're safe. Right? And now a new things are about to happen. You're in a new experience, right?" So that sequential ordering of things isn't happening in the right hemisphere. So, you look for associations. Don't worry about logical associations. If you notice some major part of the body shift as you speak, that's an important clue. Uh, when someone's been talking to you. You've been talking to someone in the audience and they been like this. And suddenly they switch like this, some major psychological shift is taking place inside their subjective experience, and there's research to show that. Any movement, not a movement of the hand, slight movement of the hand, but a major movement of the torso or, you know, there's one client I had and I loved it, because any time she'd start talking about and men, she would do her hands up like this. Every single time. And, uh, whoa, we've been going, going, going, going. Okay. Where am I? I'm lost? Am I going forwards or backwards? I don't know? Okay. There you go. So, it's touchy. So, uh, you, you watch these kinds of things, so you're trying to see what's happening inside the person. Anytime I'm talking to someone, and they suddenly look up to the corner while I'm talking, I stop talking. And I've had individuals who, because I was talking about their marriage and their wife, and they're trying to tell me you know, if she was any other woman I would think she's having an affair because of this and because of this and because of this and because of this. And I say something about, so she's, you know, not capable of having an affair, or something like that? And he turns like that. And you stop. And, they're gone. I mean, 10, 15 minutes go by. And the person turns back to you and says, "My wife is having an affair." You know, and they put the whole thing together in their head. I've had that happen on a lot of occasions. And so, you, just by your timing of things, you can make marvelous things happen in therapy or you can really screw it up, because you're just rushing them along. Okay? So, just turn to someone close to you. We don't have time for both of you to do this. I've got all these wonderful exercises, and you, you were, and one of you be the operator. One of you be the subject. Next time you'll switch up the role, okay?. We're just going to take five minutes to do this. It's not much time. I want to say that, go ahead all the way stop talking please, thank you. I want to say from observing from the stage when I was trying to get to happen wasn't really happening. That's okay, right. Therapists are some very independent autonomous people, and that's a wonderful thing. Here's what it would have, my fault. I forgot to have you practice using your quiet voice. I was going to do that and forgot. It just simply escaped me. Let's do that right now before I forget again. I'm going to have all of you say, "Hello, Dan." But in a soft soft voice. Ready? One, two, three. 

04:49:35
AUDIENCE Hello, Dan. 

04:49:40
DAN SHORT Softer. One more time. One, two, three. 

04:49:45
AUDIENCE Hello, Dan. 

04:49:45
DAN SHORT Very nice. You guys are wonderful. Thank you for cooperating. You're a good group of people, and that, if you'll use that level, you won't, you won't have to compete with your neighbor. You won't feel like you have to talk over them. And it will make a lot of you feel more relaxed, because some of us, not all of us, some of us get kind of nervous when there's a lots of noise in a room like this. It's overwhelming. So, we'll just keep it nice and soft while we do the exercises. Here's what the exercise would have looked like if you were doing it correctly. The operator would've said, "Tell me about something you remember." And the subject would've said, "Like what?" And the operator would go, "one, two, three, four, five, anything you would like to think about." And the subject would say, "Can I talk about my first birthday party that I remember?" And the operator would go, "One, two, yes." One, two, three, four, five. "I think a birthday party would be great." Right? And so it really slows things down. I've done this with graduate students, and had them experience profound shifts in what it means to talk to someone in just 15 minutes of doing this. We don't have 15 minutes, and so I just wanted to give you a brief sample. I'm already by my clock 18 minutes behind where I should be in this presentation to cover everything. Wow. So, we're going to move on. I challenge you, I challenge you to go out there. You may not count to five, you know, after your client says t hing. That, that was kind of stretching it out. Slow it down and see what happens. You're speaking hypnotically when you do that. One more thing about the right hemisphere, the unconscious mind, the way this piece of brain seems to work is that it's very oriented to spatial location, spatial reasoning, body location. That's why another piece on, for you therapies that work with women, as opposed to men, that have come from abusive family settings, maybe where they've been sexually abused her physically abused, a common characteristic of them is that they'll have bruises on their elbows or they'll have lots of broken glass at home from thinking they were setting it on the counter and really just set it not quite on the counter. The bruises on the elbows come from running into doors or bruised toes from running into objects on the ground that they thought were they were going to pass. And what happened was while the child was in this emotionally overwhelming environment growing up and therefore sort of had to suppressed emotional experiencing, they also turned off the part of the body that's responsible for the development of spatial awareness and body awareness. These people don't know where their body begins and ends, right? So, that's just a function that that part of the brain plays. And when that part of the brain has not been fully developed, that functions not there, being played very well. Another interesting thing about the right hemisphere is what it's thinking, you see me going to different places in my mind as I'm communicating with you. There were some thoughts I had over there and some I had right there. This thought is right here right now. Milton Erickson sometimes when he was working with individuals he would say, "Right here in this chair, it seems impossible. And you don't see any way out of your dilemma, but you can conceive of being over there and over there having a different perspective of things. Is that right? And from there, seeing the world slightly differently, and maybe seeing a solution to your problem." Once the person is agreeing with that line of reasoning, he actually had the person then move and sit in that chair over there. And suddenly when they sit over there, a new awareness comes to them and their mind starts working differently, because they're accessing unconscious resources, because the right hemisphere works in terms of spatial relations. That's why you can, a patient who has rage at an ex-husband who physically abused them or the famous airplane phobia case. Erickson was working with a woman who had airplane phobia. And she sat in the chair. And he had all of her phobias connected to the chair such that when she stood up, she could leave her phobias behind and leave the phobias in the chair. And so when she left the chair, she no longer had fear of flying. That makes no sense to left hemisphere. Left hemisphere goes nuts with that kind of stuff, right? It makes no sense. For the right hemisphere, that makes perfect sense. That is logical according to right hemisphere or according to unconscious reasoning. That reasoning is perfectly legitimate. Right? So, in therapy we can use the body. You see folks doing this a lot with therapist that do the bodywork, right? And they'll, or mindfulness too. They'll have the person go to a certain location in their body. And what do you experience there, in your stomach? And what is your stomach trying to tell to you? Or you may have something happening in this and. And you can direct their awareness there and learn what they kept in this hand, but this hand is trying to tell something different. And this hand wants to, as I had one client, this hand was trying to do this. And, so we kind of got an understanding of what that meant. What does this hand want to do? This hand wanted to do this. And so I had her actually physically do it. And as she was doing this she suddenly started crying and realizing she hadn't learned how to take care of herself. All she had learned to do her whole life was being a task manager, never learned how to care for herself, never give yourself permission to care for herself. And she's bawling in front of me as she has this new realization. And we were simply just talking to, reasoning with the right hemisphere. Hadn't done any trance induction. Hadn't done anything fancy, but just understanding how to talk to that part of the brain. So, you can locate things the body. You can have a person move around the room. The universe, where is your safe place and how would you like to get there? I think it was Yapco talking about working with individuals who have trauma or PTSD and how important it is to establish a safe place. And, I've worked with individuals, oh my goodness, this one poor gentlemen. He was a kind man, a smart man. Very successful in business. Financially very capable. Very handsome man. And, in bad relationships with females that were verbally abused him and end up leaving him. And he was one such relationship. He had married a female, and she was by her own description abusive toward him. And, he didn't understand why he put up with her. And constantly critical and just was on a daily basis tearing away at his being. And, uh, when we were trying to make sense of what was going on in his life, I was asking a little bit about his family history. I was getting him to tell me the story of his life, of his relationship with his father. When he's giving me a narrative account of his life, what part of the brain are we accessing? Right, you're right, it's the right. That's a great trance induction. You have the person start telling me the story of their life. His father is dead. And were you there at his death? He's crying. Yeah, I was there. It was bad. It was awful. You know, my dad had since at the age of six decided to stop loving me and let me know about it. And blamed me for problems in the family. Wanted nothing to do with me. Told me I'd amount to nothing in life. And I heard that he dying and I, I flew to the hospital to be there. And I went to his bed. And the monitor is not looking good. His heart, the nurses tell me you could die today. And, I went there to try and hold his hand. And he said to me. "Where you doing here?" So, I said, "Dad, I love you. I love you. I want to be with you." He said, "Well, I don't love you. Get out of my room. Get out of my room." Beep. That was his father's dying words, and he carried that in him. And I said, "I think you need to have a talk with your father." He said, "I can't. My father is dead." I said, "That's fine. We'll take you to where he's at." Yeah, he was scared. He said, "How?" I said, "Close your eyes. You're going to see a place in time and space where your father's contained right now. I don't know if it's going to be filled with light or darkness, but you could just close your eyes and tell me what you see." He said, "It's a big dark room. My father is in the middle slumped over in a chair. I can't see his face." I said, "Walk up to him. Put your hand on his shoulder." All right, so we're physically doing things. And we're somewhere in the universe, right? Where in a universe space, some black dungeon like space, and he walks over to him, and he puts his hand on the shoulder in his imagination. And I say, "Say the thing that you need to say to your father, that you needed to say all along, that you can only say with him small, broken in front of you, unable to do anything. Unable to effect this world in any way. Unable to affect you in any way at this point. Say what you needed to say to him." And he put his hand on his shoulder and he said, "Dad, I forgive you. I forgive you for the mistakes you made. I forgive you for failing to love your son the way you should have." I said, "What's happening now?" He said, "He's turning to me, and is looking around over his shoulder. And his face is flooded with tears." Then I said," Do you want to move away from him or stay there?" He said, "Stay there." And I said, "Stay there." I "Is he trying to stand up?" He said, "yes." I said, "Do you want to help them stand up?" And he said, "Yes." So, he helped his father stand up, and he embraced him in a hug. And I said, "What's your father saying to you?" He said, "My father is saying thank you, now I can rest in peace." That guy was a different person after that session. He was bolder and more assertive. He put the divorce through. Bought him a new home, and the new home was something casa. I don't remember the name of it, but it meant in Spanish, "House of peace". What is that? Can someone tell me? There you have it. So, uh, all right, that's what I mean by that. So, let's see. We should be at this point, we need to be, it needs to be 10 after, we're catching up almost. Okay, were doing a good job. So, stress reduction exercises. As a group. Okay, so I'm going to do this for you. All you got to do is relax. That's your job. With your eyes open or your eyes closed if you're going to be a hypnotherapist, you should have experienced this technique I'm going to do at least once. It's very fundamental. Everyone should do it. Were going to use your body to invite activity from the right hemisphere to do good work for you, healing work. First, go to your feet. Become aware of your feet. If they want to be in shoes, you can leave them in shoes. That's making them warm and comfy, leave them in shoes. If they want to be free, and they want to breathe, then you can easily slip them out of your shoes, then feel free to do so. Either way. Doesn't matter. You can allow the bottoms of your feet to become connected with the floor with this structure that is rooted in the earth. And in that way be connected to the earth, the heat, the warmth, the solidness of the earth, the energy of the earth, which will begin to find its way up into your body and the relaxation is going to move up. First through your toes to your ankles, then to your calves. Any tension, any muscle tension held in the back of your calves can begin to dissolve. It may dissolve with you being motionless, or it may be that there's some slight movement with your leg or other part of your body but you can simply hold your awareness and that part of your body front of your calves, your knees. If you're a person that has chronic pain, that pain becomes somewhat muted because we have something much more interesting were going to do right now. You're going to become in touch with your body, moving on up through the bottoms of your thighs. And if there is a piece of your body that makes you feel nervous to be aware of, you can skip over it. You can ignore my voice if I say anything that would be associated with uncomfortable emotions. Your unconscious mind can just tune it out for you, and those of you that are ready can release the tension from the tops of your thighs, from all around your waist. And the chair you're sitting in can suddenly become the most comfortable chair in the world. Wouldn't matter what it's made of. Could've been made of granite, but to you now it can feel like sitting on a cloud. And the muscles in your lower back and around your stomach, the muscles of your abdomen, the center of all your energy movement can become peaceful, still, at ease. Whatever thoughts or images that want to flow through your mind can simply make their journey through. You do not need to make anything happen. Relaxation at this point is automatic, spontaneous as it moves on up. The energy feeling filling you in a pleasant way. In a way that does not require effort. Letting go of the tension in your arms, forearms, hands, fingers. Even your pinky becomes relaxed. Utterly relaxed. And that's what I like to do when I go to the dentist. I relax my pinky. My pinky finger and my pinky toe. And that's where I keep my conscious awareness. That's why I don't need Novocain. That's why I'm not bothered by with the dentist may do. Because I'm in a different part of my body, and that part of my body is really truly relaxed. Going up to your shoulders in your neck. Just at the base of your skull, and your jaw. And those of you who hold chronic tension in your jaw as it begins to relax right now, you actually experience a drop down a little. And for those of you who experience tension in the muscles around your skull, as those muscles relax your ears will drop down just a little. And the muscles atop and underneath and around your eyeballs can relax so that your whole body is adrift. And this is a nice state to be in. And you can return to this state multiple times throughout the day. And many times throughout the night as you move through different sleep cycles, sometimes moving your body. Other times becoming profoundly still, profoundly relaxed. This is how we care for ourselves. Just as with breathing, we breathe in. We breathe out. Sometimes we're excited and our muscles become tense. And then we moved to a new moment of relaxation, and are muscles become relaxed. And that is the essence of stress management. Now, for those of you who are ready, you can open your eyes, reorient to the room. For those of you who want to continue listening to my lecture in a trance, you can listen with your eyes opened or closed. Doesn't matter. You'll still get full benefit. Another important point is that we want to expand rather than limit choices and options. That's why you'll hear trainers in hypnosis, especially Ericksonians, encourage you to avoid words such as should, have to, must, quit, stop, you know, stop smoking, quit smoking. You have to feel something. You should relax. Things like that. Don't do this. Fix, cure. Cure doesn't give a person much choice. You're going to cure them. Always, never. Okay? Just watch out for these words. If you're saying them to someone, in trans or out of trance, you'd better have a darned good reason. Because, and I'm not, I'm not saying never say these words. Right? But, be careful with these words, because they tend to limit people's options. And when you start caging people up with the suggestions you give them, you do not increase their flexibility. You actually reinforce and increase their rigidity. Right? We were told that Erickson, one of the things he's trying to do is help people increase their flexibility. Flexibility means you have the right to get well, and you have the right to hang on to some symptoms if you choose. You have the right to feel some relief from pain, but you also have the right to sometimes feel the pain of the things that bother you and upset you. One of the things that we're doing when we use language in hypnosis that expands choices and options, is we're shifting the person from external locus of control to internal locus of control. Right? We as Ericksonian do not like to think in terms of hypnosis as a competition where I overcome your conscious mind. I overcome all your resistances, so that I can take charge of you and get you on the right track and finally make your life one that's correct. Okay? That's not as helpful as thinking in terms of providing the person with new options, new possibilities, new internal resources. Telling the person, thinking a metaphor like being a, a leaf floating down the river. That leaf can go in any direction it is ready to go. The leaf can stay on the river or the leaf can fly into the air with the wind. The leaf can sink underwater or the leaf can become a part of the universe and sing with the stars or whatever. So, the idea with internal locus of control is that I personally am in control of my destiny. Even though I may be can't control all aspects of my life. You have clients come to you sometimes complaining, "I feel like my life is out of control. I feel like I'm just the leaf floating on a river, right?" So, they're using that analogy but they are from a perspective of helplessness, because the external world is controlling their direction. You can use the same analogy, but now you using the analogy in such a way that they do have choices options. And they are ultimately in control of their fate and where they end up. What we know from, you know, research that has been done on this internal/external sense of control since the 70s, and it generally comes up with the same thing, which is that people who have measurable internal locus of control tend to be less depressed, less anxious. They tend to be better problem solvers. They tend to have less help problems. They tend to be more in there, they show more initiated in their problem-solving, and they don't give up as quick as people with an external locus of control. They shut down faster. They become more depressed. They,uh, they're more likely to respond to situations with helplessness. Uh, previously unrecognized potentials. You will find that you can discover, grow, explore, develop. These are words that you do want your vocabulary, okay? Uh, discover is a nice one. Grow is a wonderful word. Your awareness can grow. The strength in your unconscious mind can grow. Uh, your readiness to experience a new life. You can discover it. You know, all of these things that open up possibilities. And, uh, there's been some folks that have defined hypnosis that way, as a method of uncovering previously unrecognized resources within the individual, previously unrecognized by their unconscious. The expression of ambivalence. Every once in a while we have individuals that both want to change and don't want to change. They both want to divorce the abusive husband and they don't want to divorce the abusive husband. They both want to be in therapy and they don't want him therapy. They both want you to hypnotize them and don't want you to hypnotize them. Uh, that comes from the two hemispheres. I'll explain it in a minute, but if you ever have someone sit in front of you like this, and say, "Okay, hypnotize me." My suggestion to you is to first ask, "Have you had experience with hypnosis?" Most often the person and say, "Yes." You say, "How many people tried to hypnotize you?" They'll say, "Lots." And you say, "Did any of succeed?" "Not a one. Now hypnotize me." They, they're not being dishonest. They're not trying to make, play on your insecurities or making ineffectual as a therapist. They honestly want to be hypnotized. They have a severe problem. They know that hypnosis is the only thing that'll work, and they want their problem to go away, but they're not ready for the problem to go away. They want you to be powerful and have an influence over them, yet they don't want you to be powerful have influence over them. It's more so probably the left hemisphere that has a logical agenda. I need to stop doing these things. They're very self-defeating. I've got these problems were I, it seems like my unconscious mind is more like Freud's unconscious mind. I want to marry my father and kill my, whatever it is. And so, the person at a conscious level wants you to hypnotize them. Right hemisphere, that works more off of association and emotion and has unconscious attitudes is scared. It's scared of having someone exercise that much power over them. It's scared of doing life in a completely different way. It's scared of letting its defenses down. So, you have two different competing parts of the brain acting on a person simultaneously. How do you expand rather than limit options? If you try to make the person go into trance, you're limiting their options and choices. If you refuse to use hypnosis with them and you say, "You're too resistant. Hypnosis is not going to work with you.", You just not done your job and you also limited their choices and options. So how do you expand their choices and options? Does anybody know? Anyone want to hazard a guess? What you do is you need to do hypnosis with them so that they can prove that you that they can't, you can't put them in the trance. So you need to let them, you need to let them show you that you fail. And then after you fail, you show them how it can also succeed. So, you can both let it fail and succeed simultaneously. With one woman I'm thinking, uh, I think she asked me how I was going to put her in a trance, I said something about, no, it didn't go that way. Somehow she knew about eye closure. She said something along the lines of, "You're not going to be to get my eyes to close." And I said, "You are right. And now keep them wider open and wider open. As you stay wider awake and wider awake. Further away from a trance, further away from a trance." So, her head bobs over, right. She was doing two things simultaneously. She was defeating me and not letting my suggestion work, and she was allowing herself to experience hypnosis, which she had been wanting to do for seven years. So, you do both things simultaneously. Okay, where are we supposed to be at with our time now, so I'm going to, okay. It's supposed to be 25 after. Not too bad. Okay, so this exercise, sorry web camera. Okay. When the subject is ready, with his/her eyes closed, the operator instructs him or her to envision a scene that brings you great joy and satisfaction. So, in a minute, I don't want to lose you guys yet, if you haven't had a chance to be operator yet, this is your turn. Oh, this quote. Let me read this quote at the top. Once imagined, an idea will tend to realize itself within the limits of possibility. It's a wonderful quote. It came from some researchers that were looking at neuro plasticity and looking at the effects of imagination and also the activation of neural pathways and whatnot. And they're finding that in many ways imagining something and really absorbing yourself in that imagination will produce neural growth in the same way as if the person was physically doing it. So, imagination has tremendous power on the brain and on the body. Someone imagining their warts going away can alter their physiology in such a way that the warts go away. It's one of the most common things that hypnosis is used for. And with children, it's found to be highly successful. And, so you don't have to put kids in the trance. You just tell them, just imagine, like that research that Yapco was telling us that Barber used. Just imagine. It worked just as good as hypnosis. Imagination is very powerful. So, and that's of course, the imagination is located mostly in the right hemisphere, not the logical/analytical part of our brain. So, when you have someone imagine, you're engaging the right hemisphere. If you feel, when you leave this Erickson conference, and you feel kind of uncomfortable with this and you think, "Geez, I don't know if I've been trained as much as I need to to really do hypnosis the right way with clients, and I don't think I've got what it takes." That's okay. When you're working with clients, just have them imagine things. Have them imagined getting better, you know. Steve (inaudible) did that essentially with the miracle question, right? He just had people imagine. They woke up one day and things were better. And what did they see? It works very well, especially with children, it works just as good as doing a trance induction. Okay, so the operator is, you're going to ask the person questions so that you can learn about their place that brings them great joy and satisfaction with enough detail that it's as if you've been there yourself. So, if they are off at a waterfall or if there is some castle with a long table or whatnot, you need to know what the smells are what the sights are, how it feels to be there, the temperature, where things are located. Keep asking, this is an interactive exercise. Keep asking the person questions. As you're asking them questions, you should be going into trance too. Some of you will recognize and notice that whenever I want to do trance work with the audience, I go into trance myself first. I believe that whenever you're doing hypnosis with a client, the first person you should hypnotize is yourself. It makes it easier that way. It's hard to stay out of a trance once your therapist has gone into a trance himself. Plus, you're simply accessing another part of your brain, and you're going to become much more intuitive, much more insightful. You're going to notice all kinds of things about that person you wouldn't have noticed if you weren't in trance. So, the operator goes into trance too as you begin to see and learn this place that they're talking about. Bring it to life. Were going to do this for just about five minutes, not much time. And talk very softly, both of you. Okay? So find a person, ask them about this place that finds great satisfaction and joy. Learn about it. The sights, the sounds.

DAN SHORT I'm thinking that we have some people in here that may have taught kindergarten at some point in the past, because they know this works. They're wanting me to get the hands raised, so if, stop talking and raise your hand. Everybody stop talking. Raise your hand. Stop talking. Raise your hand. Stop talking. Raise your hand. Wonderful, and we're also sure, aren't we. That's great. Thank you. A little bit of automatic hand levitation there. I, I had a demonstration I was doing once where a fellow was using, there were two of us doing the demonstration. He went first. And he was going to use classical hypnosis, teach it to the audience. And he did a trick that stage hypnotists do. A hundred in the room. You've got at least 10 people who are highly susceptible to suggestion. So, he did a sort of a trance induction thing with the room, and looked to see who was responding. And then got out of the room the person most responsive, who was already going into a trance. Brought him to the front of the room and demonstrated all these amazing things, these amazing hypnotic phenomena. Uh, hypnotic amnesia and hallucinations and all of these things. It was a great demonstration. And one in 100 patients will this for you. And so, I, he, his demonstration was really not going to be one I was going to upstage. I was on stage right after him. And I said, "All right. Now I'm going to demonstrate something to you different. I'm going to demonstrate what to do with the person who will not go into a trance very easily just in case you get someone in your office that's resistant. I want to figure out who is least likely to go into a trance. We're going to do in arm levitation eventually, but first, no." I did a arm levitation exercise, and all these people kind of feeling it, right. And then after I was done, four or five minutes of that, I said, "All right, now. If you felt no movement in your hand and were no way in a trance, raise your hand." And so, this guy raised his hand. He's out in the audience, and I'm like, he's mine. I've got him. He doesn't know it, but he's mine. All right. So, let's kind of start pulling all this together, okay. I want to show you how it all pulled together. So, I have a boy in my office. The parents have brought him, and he's very disturbed because he's been wetting his bed. And nothing will work to get him to stop wetting his bed. His parents are kind. They're not punishing him or anything like that. It's not the parents agenda that he quit wetting the bed, but to the boy is very concerned about it. And so, the mom urges him, "Tell the psychologist what it is you want, dear." And, in a very shy, awkward way but a brave way, he says, "I want to stop wetting my bed." And then I say to him, "You know, your mom and your father are here. And, they don't seem too concerned about this problem. Seems like they would be fine if you had this problem that many boys have that didn't go away right away." The boy says, "But I wanted to quit. Can you help me? My mom and dad told me you can help me." And I said, "Yes. I can use some hypnosis. It might be a little bit painful. Do you really want me to do this?" And the boy. I say, "All right. You are over there. Come over here. I went to have my leg out to support you. You're going to need to lay across my knee. Come over here." The boy lays across my knee. You wouldn't do this with everyone, but this is a family that's very comfortable with these kinds of things." Lay across my knee. I want to put a pee-pee switch in your back." He's looking down at the ground. "Are you ready for me to put that switch in? Okay." I push down on his back just a little bit. I said, "Just one more moment. All right. There you go. You can stand up now." So he stands up, and he looks at me. I say, "How does that feel?" He says, "Okay." "Can you feel the pee-pee switch in there?" I say, " Good. All right. Were going to leave that where it is. It's going to help you at night. Now, I'm not able to do magic, so I can't just magically make this go away. This switch, what it will do, is it will, when you need to pee-pee at night, this switch will switch and wake you up. You'll have a few seconds to get up out of your bed and go to the bathroom. If you choose to go back to sleep again, you may end up with an accident in your bed. And if that happens, that's okay. This switch will work again the next night. Just, the next night when it wakes up, you want to make sure to go ahead and stand up pretty quickly and go to the bathroom. If you need to stay half-asleep while you're doing it, that can work too. People go to the bathroom in their sleep, and they still find the potty and get all the pee-pee in the potty just fine. It's a doable. But, that switch is in you and you can use it now. Can you still feel it in their?" "Yes, I can." All right. So, there, you've expanded his choices, right,whereas before you had them making a lot of choices as he's moving towards you, and he's moving towards this experience. Now he's got a switch. The switch offers all kinds of choices. Now he's got the choice of waking up too. You are talking to him in a slow voice. You're doing here and there and locating things in his body. There's a switch. As you're talking about the switch, his mind is trying to picture, is it a light switch or something like that? He's using imagination. You literally blocked together all the elements that I just described. No need to waste your time with, you know, count from ten down to one or eyeball staring. Nothing. You don't need that really. Especially not with children. Not really with adults too. I've done the same thing with adults. A woman that was overly promiscuous, I worked with lots of her clients so I knew stories about her. Gawd, I'd hate to be that woman's husband. Man, what she does to men, and you know. She has four or five men around her at all times. And, this woman acts and dresses in a provocative way. And she's causing real problems. She's, you know, cheating on her husband, and getting herself in bad situations. Hating herself and who she is. And I tell her, "You know, do you know what feminine power is? Have you ever heard that, feminine power?" She said, "No." And I said, "Well, it's something you have a lot of. Did you do that?" She said, "What do you mean?" And I said, "The effect you have on men. You know I see people that work with you, and you know what they say. What effect you have on men." She blushes. I said, "Do you know how to turn it off? Have you figured out where the switch is? You're going to want to be able to turn that on and off or it's going to destroy your life. that's going to be your homework assignment. You're going to go out there, and when you're around then that you shouldn't be with, you turn off the feminine power." As it turns out, she's going to end up being divorced. It was already kind of, the whole thing's happened. And she's not going to be married much longer. She's scared about finding a, a new person, whether or not someone could ever love her, all that kind of stuff. She had been raped when she was 13. There had been a lot of sexual trauma. And out of the men, there are some men out there that are bad for you, dangerous men. Men that would hurt you. Those aren't the men you're going to turn it on with when you're around them. Leave it turned off. But, there are some nice men out there, men that would make good fathers, who would give you that child you've wanting, be kind, would protect you and your child. When you're around that person, you turn it on. You'll have no problem finding the right man. And so, she comes the back a week later, every session since, dressed in much less provocative clothing, holding her body in much less provocative and in non-provocative ways. She learned to turn it off. She realized in therapy it didn't need to be on. It really was the right place for it. And she told me, "I did what you said. I did what you told me to do, to practice turning it on and off." And I was like, "You were at a restaurant?" And she said, "Yes." And I said, "And you had it off and you are getting much attention?" And she said, "Yeah." And I said, "You turned it on and suddenly men started coming toward you, paying attention." She goes, "I did. I did. How did you know?" I said, "My wife has a girlfriend that did that. She did the same darned thing. We went to Hooters and suddenly turned it on, and had this person come up to her table and try to get her phone number from her. She had stuffed a little tissue paper in the bathroom to kind of cheat, it was part of her turning it on." So, these things, they work with children. They work with adults. You're, you're locating, you're using imagination. You're locating things in physical space and time. You're talking slowly. Your expanding choices and options. Is everybody following me so far? Okay. So, way behind, okay. So, next thing we're going to do is you construct meaning from the client's experiential realities. And,uh, we do this simply by using the client's exact words. I had one client who was telling me about how she wanted to help, she'd been traumatized and abused as a child and couldn't date men. Couldn't envision herself ever being able to make love again, and so I unskillfully, I made a mistake and I said, "So, you want to have sex? You want to have sex again?" And she recoiled, and a look of horror came over her face. And I said, "Oh, you're not okay with what I just said, are you?" And she said, "Sex is dirty. And, I'm sorry, but it felt like you abused me when you said that." And I was like, "Then, that's a dirty word we will use it here anymore, and I won't have anything to do with trying to make you do that. I have no interest in you doing that anywhere. You want to make love. Right?" She was like, "Yes." "And, you want to make love with her right man, someone who will be kind and caring towards you." "Yes." "I will help you figure out how you can make love once again. All right?" So, you may think, the person said, "My mother." And you say, "Your mom." And you may think you're still talking about the same thing. You are not talking about the same thing anymore. You are no longer. The left brain, yes, knows it's the same thing. The left brain understands the dictionary. It understands that mother and mom are the same word. The right brain has certain meanings, certain experiential events associated with certain words. So, to speak the client's language, you have to use their exact words. If you want to be able to reach that person. If you have someone tell you more than once, "I feel so dirty inside." Or "I feel so stupid." And they keep emphasizing that. If you want to be able to speak to that person and you want to reach them, you need to be willing to use those words while you talked to them. And so, you want to get dirty feeling out of you. That comment I just made was so stupid. So, you say to the person, "Yes, you're right. That comment was so stupid." And that doesn't sound very kind, but I had the experience once of a woman. She'd been a, you know, emotionally abused in a loving way, I guess you could say, by her husband. He would always make her the brunt of his jokes. They were kind of old-school marriage, and he was the strong man that was always there for her. He always kind of teased her about how dingy she was, all these things. And that was how they knew to interact. You know, very low self-esteem. He did too, of course. And he would run her down. And that's what she was comfortable with. When she was a grandmother, she was told by her physician that she's acting like an alcoholic because she won't stop drinking since the husband's death, although every day when he came home, he'd wanted to sit on the porch and have a bottle of Crown Royal with her or a glass of Crown Royal. She was now doing this every day. Her husband was dead. She was alone in the trailer. She, because she'd been drinking, she couldn't drive, yet her daughter really needed her help. They were going to lose their home. Both the husband and the wife were working. The two daughters came home from school, there was no one to be with them. The parents couldn't afford childcare. It was just a 20 minute drive. They needed the grandmother to drive over and help watch them, because they had to have two jobs. They were trying not to lose their home. This was back before people started surrendering their homes willingly. They were trying desperately not to do that. And, she hated herself for not being a good enough, loving enough person to help her daughter. And, I listened to her describe how much she loved those two grandchildren, and I said, "It sounds like to me you're good grandmother, that you really love those two daughters. That they're lucky to have you as a grandmother." And as I was saying these things, she gripped the side of the chair and backed up like this, and her neck muscles tensed. And I said, "Oh, did I just use too much praise?" And without speaking, she said. And I said, "Would it feel better if I criticized you some?" I said, "All right." So, she'd been telling me a story a minute ago, and I used her exact words, her exact story. I said, "You know how when there's a, a violent storm, you hear it on the radio." And, no, no, no, I take that back. I said, "You know how you'd told me that you keep your car keys on the table by your telephone rather than hanging them on the key ring open door where they belong? That's really a stupid thing to do." And then she relaxed, let go of the sides of the chair, put her hands on her waist, and she said, "Well, for your information, if there happens to be it a tornado or thunderstorm, and I need to call 911 or something, I can do that, grab my keys and ran out the door." And, she was happy and she was relaxed, because she had just told me a minute ago how stupid she is because she keeps her keys on the table instead of on the key ring by the door where they belong. I had used her exact words. And I connected with the part of her where there's emotional meaning, the right brain. And now the right brain knew that I was speaking its language, that I understood it. And so I began working with her then, using her own logic on how she was going to be able to quit drinking, which she did. She did it in not too many sessions. I think it was somewhere between six and ten. I don't remember exactly how many sessions. But, and then she was able to go care for her granddaughters. Clients work according to emotional logic, right? So they have things that they feel like they have to do. They say things like, "I know this is stupid and doesn't make any sense, but I feel like I have to do this." Or they all, let's say they're overeating, and they're horribly obese. And they say, "I know I shouldn't overeat, but, you know, whenever I start to lose weight and men start to look at it more, I start to feel like I'm becoming attractive. It terrifies me." Right? So, their emotional logic is to stay overweight so you don't get raped again as you did when you were a child. That's not their left brain intellectual logic. It's their emotional reasoning that devised this problem. And, one rule that's out there is whenever the left brain and right brain art competition, it is the right brain that will dominate. When the person knows what they should do, and there's what they feel like doing or they feel they must do or they're afraid they must do, they will do the thing they're afraid they must do. It will out dominate the left hemisphere. So you go, that's why we use hypnosis, for these kinds of people in these kinds of problems. We talk to the right hemisphere, and we use its own logic to start solving the problem. Right? It's like the person that Erickson was consulting, the dentist. I believe the man would go into a trance or whenever he did go into it, he could go into a trance, and the dentist would go to drill, and he'd open his mouth and he'd always come out of trance. And so he had him ask the man why he comes out of trance. What's happening? The man said, "Because I can see you." And the dentist said, "But your eyes are still closed." He said, "I know, but my eye teeth see you." It was an uneducated man, right? And so, I'm sorry, but I forgot Erickson's exact solution now, but it had something to do with using the client's logic. He, he made a point to the dentist. Do not try to argue with him. Never argue with him. Don't give him logical factual information to try to explain why you should stay in a trance. Say, "I can also put your eyeteeth into a trance too. Would that work?" If the man says yes, then do a hypnotic induction on his eyeteeth and put his eyeteeth to sleep. I think that's actually what they did. And then you'll be pain-free. So, that's how you use the person's logic. Okay. Let's see. I need to have that done. Okay. So, we are at 5:00 and I'm supposed to end right now, right? Is that the story? Uh, communicate confidence to the client and therapy outcomes. Avoid words such as give up, try, unbelievable. If the client's doing really well, try not to say, "Wow, that's unbelievable." It would be a bad idea. Uh, you've already heard about how Erickson like to use "Yes. That's right. Very good." Brent talked about that being a form of ratification. That's how you're communicating confidence in them and what they're doing in the immediate moment. Be very enthusiastic. You can go nuts being enthusiastic. And the, the left brain may be thinking, that's a little overboard. The right hemisphere however is going to be having a lot of meaning associated with this emotional arousal that's being communicated. Yes! Yes, very good! It's, it's going to be reaching a certain part of the brain you want to reach. Prognosis, that's the presupposition that they will get better. Erickson used to like to ask for people to do things after they get better or give them something after they get better. It presupposes they'll get better. The core identity. I like to, unless I've got someone in front of me with, uh, they, you know, a killer or a real serious character disorder, I like to kind of mention you are a fundamentally good person. I've got couples that are having that problems. Neither of them is doing anything really bad though. They're not having affairs. They're not hitting each other. They're not getting drunk. I say to them, "You know, you're two fundamentally good people." And so, as you're communicating that confidence in the client, it really helps move the therapy along. You do this of course, while they're in trance too. Uh, and that is, we just missed two little exercises, but you've got more and more importantly, I made sure you've got all of the information that was intended to be communicated to you, and I hope you enjoyed it.

Jeffrey Zeig, Ph.D. 

05:45:00
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm Jeff Zeig, and again I am the director and the founder of the Milton Erickson Foundation, and I hope that you've been enjoying yourself. Yes? Fabulous teachers in this section. Is that the extent of the response? Yes. And it's been a long day for you. And you have covered an immense amount of material in a very short period of time. And, to my chagrin and perhaps your pixelation, I'm going to increase the density of material. I hope that Brent has already warned you about Jefflag? You know jet lag. Well,Jefflag happens a little quicker. Our job for today is to learn about the language of hypnosis and that this is an expressive grammar. And underlying that idea, expressive. That in order to do hypnosis, we need to do things that are in a different genre. We have language carries two important valences. One valence of language is the projection of information, but another important function of language is expressive. And it's the expressive component that is essential to music, because music is stripped of its informative function, and music is purely expressive, especially symphonic music. But, when we listen to music it moves us. Music is what moves our heart. We need information for head, but if we want to help people to change their heart, we need to rely on the expressive elements of communication. So, hypnosis, the language of hypnosis is an expressive grammar, and it's oriented to changing state. And when I talk about state, I'm going to put it in quotation marks. You'll learn about that shortly. And, were going to study some grammar forms. Were going to study about truisms, yes sets. We're going to study about presuppositions, dissociation statements, implied positives. In other words, hypnosis has a different grammar, and it has a grammar that you're not used to using. But, if we want to help somebody to change their mood, if we want to help somebody to change their perspective, if we want to help somebody to change their state, we're going to have to use a different grammar. We're going to have to use a way of thinking that is not inherent to us, because we have been so much educated in a didactic model. And, were going to be needing to move in a, into a expressive model. Those of you who have experience with the arts, those of you who are painters or writers or musicians, you're going to have a leg up, because you're going to understand something inherently about expressive communication. So, by the time that we finish our educational objectives, were going to be able to define, not only to define, but to utilize an implied causative. Were going to, you're going to be able to describe the role of the indirect forms of communication to facilitate responsiveness, it excuse me, responsiveness to hypnosis. And, you may even be able to list three para verbal techniques that you could use. And, we only have 90 minutes for this presentation that normally would take us quite, quite a longer period of time. But, our fundamental thesis is that hypnosis is about changing states. So, if you think about it in terms of a metaphor. Just from what you're learning here, you can be of value clinically. Now learning how to do an induction of hypnosis is something that this faculty can teach you in two days. In two days, you will be able to do a competent induction of hypnosis. But, learning how to do an induction in hypnosis is like how do you get from Chicago to Phoenix? You get on the plane. The utilization of hypnosis is much more complicated, which is what you do when you get to Phoenix? And, that's a much more, much more complicated question. And, when you consider the Phoenix joke, which is what is the difference between Phoenix and yogurt? And the differences the yogurt has active culture. The saving grace of that joke is that, is that it was first told about Los Angeles. And, how can we think about states? When you're learning hypnosis, if you think about it as a standard shift car. The patient is coming in, and the patient is in reverse. So the patient is suffering. They're limited in their behavior. They're limited in their perspective. They're tense. They're tight. They are in a negative state. Now, just applying neutral hypnosis, what you learn in these two days you are helping the person to transition into neutral. Now, it takes a while to learn about how to create first gear, second gear or third gear, fourth gear, sometimes fifth gear if you're in a high-performance machine. But, if you can help the person to make the transition from being in reverse to being in neutral, that may be systemically significant. So, let's just go into a little bit more of our diagram of the car. You can tell that I'm artistically challenged. This is a car. And, the front wheels we can think of as thinking and behavior. And the back wheels we can ascribe to state or affect or sensation and physiology. Now, in normal psychotherapy we give people information. We are basing psychotherapy in a psychoeducational model. We are giving people information, how do you change your negative thinking into positive thinking. How do you use "I" statements rather than "you" statements. What is the difference between assertive behavior, passive behavior and aggressive behavior? We are educating people. Now, when we get into the world of hypnosis, we're not educating people anymore. We are, and what I mean by that graphic, gesture is that we're giving people experiences. I spent 6 1/2 years intermittently learning from Milton Erickson, and over the course of that time he never, as in never, gave me information. He didn't give me, he didn't fill my left hemisphere with facts. What he did was he gave me experiences, and the experiences were stories and metaphors and allusions and tasks and fragments of poetry. And I would catch these and I would feel them and sense them, and realized them. So, it was as if he was bypassing my left hemisphere, and he was orienting me to things that would help me to be a better Jeff Zeig, not facts. The facts I could learn from books. Just as an anecdote, I'm staying at Erickson's home. I don't even remember how that happened, as a house guest. I'm putting away my things. I open up the closet. There's a box of old tapes. And, these are old reel to reel tapes of Erickson's lectures in the 1950s and the 1960s. And, they're going to turn into vinegar because this is the 1970s, and, excuse me, they're really old. And, I say to Dr. Erickson, "Can I take these? Can I listen to them? Can I put them into a more modern technology of cassettes?" And he says, "Of course." And, Erickson in the 50s and 60s is not talking to psychologists. There were no psychologists to speak of in the 50s and 60s. Social work, marriage and family therapy counseling. These weren't the professions he was speaking to. He was speaking to physicians. So, I put on the tape of Erickson doing a lecture in the 50s, and he starts and he's going, "Hypnosis. You're here because there are things that you can realize now about hypnosis. And as you begin to think about it, experience it, you begin to realize that hypnosis has been known and realize that from the Egyptian sleep temples and before." And suddenly I'm going. And I say, "Dr. Erickson, you know, I listen to this old lecture of yours, and it sounded like one long induction of hypnosis." And he said, "Jeff, I never listen to those lectures. I didn't teach content. I taught to motivate." Now, I still get a chill when I think about that, because that was so alien to me as a person who had to memorize so many facts in order to get my PhD. And here was somebody who was teaching to help somebody to change their state. He wasn't teaching information. And, I, I couldn't wrap my, my head around that. It took me years to understand that when Erickson was doing hypnosis, he was giving people an experience. And when he was doing storytelling, he was giving people an experience. And when he was teaching, he was giving people an experience. And what he was doing psychotherapy, he was giving people an experience. So, hypnosis is one of many experiential methods that's oriented to help people to change their states. Okay, thinking. So, normally in psychotherapy, we give people information and we help them to change their behavior, thinking that if you move the front wheels of the car, the back wheels are going to respond. And then people will change their state, and people will change their physiology. In 1971 or 1972 I went to my first meeting of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. I watched as a dentist, Kay Thompson(ph) hypnotized physician, a man. He had an arm levitation. His arm when an aesthetically numb, and she took a fold of skin. She pushed a needle through that fold of skin painlessly, because his hand was anesthetized. And then she said how many drops of blood do you want to bleed when I remove the needle? And we didn't even have a concept of mind/body connection. And here was somebody who was talking to the physiology, knowing that it would respond, talking to help somebody to change their state. And I said, "Okay. I want to learn hypnosis." And I realized that the car is four-wheel-drive. And it's not just two wheel drive, and we can more directly access states, and we can more directly access physiology. And that's part of the joy about studying hypnosis. Now when you start studying about systemic approaches, like family therapy, you learn that the car operates in a system. And that if you change the system, you change the functioning. You change the thinking. You change the physiology. Sal Menuchen(ph) demonstrated that you could take a diabetic family, do structural family therapy and change the blood sugar of the diabetic child by making structural changes in the family. Now normally, we think that conscious, the thinking and the behavior are more conscious, and that affect state, sensation and physiology, these things are more unconscious. But, when we start to learn hypnosis, we're learning a different grammar. We're learning this way of communicating expressively and experientially. And, as we learn that we learned we can more directly influence state. Now, I gave you these slides. You have slides in the faculty handouts. If you go to EricksonCongress.com, and you look in the faculty handouts, you will get those slides. But, these two I just decided to add later, and so I'm going to have to add those, uh, so that you don't have to worry about taking notes. When I started the first Erickson Congress, I invited Greg Bateson(ph) to be the keynote speaker along with Jay Haley. And when Bateson finally agreed to present, I said to him, "Were going to press with the brochure. What should you call your keynote speech?" And he said, "Well, call it science or power." And that was his way of understanding Erickson. And, it was stunning off the top of his head. And unfortunately he died a few months before the meeting. He never gave that speech, so we still can use that concept. When we're in the land of hypnosis, we're no longer in the land of didactic information. We're in this land of experiential approaches. Now, if I want to give you information, and explain to you the science of trees then I could say to you that there's a classification for trees. And I could say are responsible for knowing everything about the classification of trees. I could say to you that trees have a morphology, and you're responsible to learn everything possible about the morphology of trees. We would be filling your head with facts. And, what would that do to you as far as changing your state? You would go into a trance, but it would be boredom. So, if you want to get the felt sense of tree, and you were a visual artist you might show somebody a picture of a tree or a painting of a tree. Now, if your art was using words, and you're a poet, like Robert Frost, you would say, "Tree in my window. Window tree. Your sash is lowered when night comes on. But let there never be curtain drawn between you and me. Vague dream head, lifted out of ground, and thing next most diffuse, a cloud. Not all of your light tongues speaking aloud would be profound, but tree I've seen you taken and tossed. And if you've seen me when I slept, you've seen me taken and swept and all but lost. That day that fate, that day she put her heads together, fate had her imagination about her. Yours, so much more concerned with outer. Mine with inner weather." Now, I know that that's hard for some of the foreign people to grasp some of those concepts, but that is a beautiful poem. Now that, is not didactic. That is weird communication, but the weird communication is expressive. And the expressive communication that poets learn to use as metaphors and allusions, this is what moves you and makes you feel the poem. The idea that somebody could talk about a leaf and say that the leaf was a light tongue. Well, I get that. Yeah, a leaf is a light tongue. And that a vague dream head lifted out of ground is a tree. And thing next most diffuse to clouds. It's a tree. And Robert Frost said that a poem should enter with delight and exit with wisdom. And in the same way, hypnosis, and in the same way psychotherapy should enter with delight and exit with wisdom. And so, what we learn hypnosis, some part of it that's, many people find a little challenging is the idea that we have to learn a different vocabulary and a different grammar that we use in order to make simple ideas come live. And it's a kind of poetic grammar. And one of my hobbies is memorizing poetry, sometimes better than others. But, I do memorize poetry because poets know expressive communication, and I feel like I could learn expressive communication by memorizing poetry. And I can understand more about Erickson, who was a master at using expressive communication. So, that's my introduction to you, and I want that introduction to orient you to art, the grammar of poetry is not everyday grammar. The grammar of music is not everyday grammar. This is the subject of my keynote speech on Sunday, is trying to make a connection between the grammar of Beethoven and the grammar of Erickson. The grammar of movies is not the grammar of science. And we don't go to movies because we want information. We go to movies because we want to change our state. And movie makers have a different grammar, and they understand how to move the human heart. And so fortunately, Milton Erickson is a foundation upon which we can stand because Erickson had to invent a grammar and how to help people to change their state. Now, we need a little bit of an understanding about hypnosis, and so we go back into the didactic realm, just, just for a short excursion. And, we're going to look at the phenomenology of hypnosis. And, I'm going to say to you now that you've spent an entire day hypnosis doesn't exist. I'm sorry to inform you. But, hypnosis is a construct of convenience. It's a syndrome like MÃ©niÃ¨re's is a syndrome. But, meditation is a syndrome, and happiness is a syndrome. And motivation is a syndrome. And they're a compilation of parts. If you put these parts together in a particular way, the recipient can title their experience in meditation or reading or prayer or active imagination or hypnosis. And if you understand the components, you know better about what it is that you're trying to be elicit when you're doing the induction of hypnosis. We are going to fly through this, and challenge you to just absorb this in the most general terms. And it will take a while to master it. I could describe to you how to paint, something I don't know how to do really, but if I could describe that to you, it wouldn't make you a painter, but you would know some of the technology of the different brushstrokes. Just bear with me, stay with me for this. And fasten your seatbelts. Okay. So, one thing that we're doing and one of the components of hypnosis is often, not always, is often a change in attention. Some people if they focus their attention they say I'm in the trance. Some people, if they pull their attention internal, they say I'm in a trance. They really don't need very much to say I'm in a trance. And these people we affectionately refer to as trance adepts. Now, some people need more than that, and we may have to take them into a different area. Some people may need to change the intensity of their experience, and they may need to have either more or less vivid experience. So, some people will say I'm in a trance when they feel an intense relaxation, when their visual imagery, internal or external, changes and is more vivid. When, some people may say that they;re in trance when things are less vivid, when they don't feel the movement of their arm as they're doing an arm levitation, when they don't feel their body, when they don't realize the passage of time. And then they say, now I know I'm in the trance. Some people need more than that. Some people need a sense of dissociation. And I mean that sense of dissociation in two ways, that things just happen. Suddenly, images just happened. Memories just happen. Movements just happen. Sensations just happen. And when they get that dissociative sense, things just happen, they say I'm in a trance. Some people need a sense of being a part of and a part from. Okay, Mr. Smith, how do you know that you are in a trance? Well, I know that I was in a trance, because I was here but I was there. And there's a sense of being here and there, a part of and apart from. And some people know they're in a trance when there's a mild sense of destabilization. I can say to you that over 6 1/2 years of being with Milton Erickson, I always felt destabilized. I had no idea, is he talking to me now? Is he teaching me now? Is this hypnosis that he doing now? Is he doing therapy? But, it was always the sense that if I was destabilized, my next step was going to be to move forward. And if you are going to move forward, there needs to be a momentary destabilization. In music we call this disharmony. A disharmony is just an unstable harmony that promises a stable harmony to follow. And we are going to understand that if you're going to do hypnosis, there's going to be some confusion. Say that differently. There's going to be some sense of destabilization. Say that differently. There's going to be some use of disharmony. And, disharmony and destabilization and mystification, they are such powerful words, and they have such pejorative meaning to some people. But, really they're a necessity. And when you think about movies and music and poetry, destabilization is just part of the process. It just an unstable harmony that promises a stable harmony to follow. Now, some people need something else, which is that they need a change in their interpersonal responsiveness. How do you know that you were in trance? Well, I know that I was in trance because I did things, and I don't know why I did them. And they're responding to the implicit cues in the communication. The implicit cues in communication are the purview of social psychology. Anyone here that has taken a course in social psychology has learned how people respond to attributions, how people respond to obedience, how people respond to social mimicry, how people respond to implication, how people respond to contextual cues and demand characteristics. This is, this is the latest in our understanding of human neurobiology, which is how people respond to cues without realizing what it is that has caused that responsiveness. The research on priming is tremendous. And, we should know it because we apply it when were doing hypnosis. We can say that Erickson was a consummate social psychologist, absolutely curious about how people responded to implication. And he was delighted when you responded to implication. And, I can,uh, you know, if you talk with Roxana Erickson, who is here on our Board of Directors, she would tell you stories about being with Dr. Erickson and suddenly having this impulse to want to pick up a particular book and give it to him. And, uh, he would be doing this through telling stories. I'll tell you the worst one. I just, I just it gives me no amount of grief, because if I lived for a century I'd never figure it out. I was talking with Lance, Erickson's second son, and he was telling me about a game that he and his older brother, Bert, would play when they were young boys. And it was about hiding a coin. And Dr. Erickson would say, "Let's play that game about hiding the coin." And the boys would go yeah. And Dr. Erickson would start in his very breezy, voluble, vulpine way as a storyteller, and he would be saying, you know, the coin, well, maybe the coin is under the table. And then he would be telling a story. And then he would say, oh yeah, well, maybe the coin, it's underneath the pot over there. And then he would tell another story, and he would say, "You know, maybe the coin is underneath the chair." And then he would tell another story. And then the boys would say, "Dad, make the coin appear under the radio." And Erickson would tell another story, and then he would say, "Well, you know, if you believe that the coin is under the radio, why don't you look under the radio?" And the boys would look under the radio, and there was a coin. And through the storytelling, he would set them up to respond to the implicit message in the communication. I think he was just doing his aerobic exercises, learning something about responsive communication, which to me is fundamental to hypnosis. If you're saying to someone, "Lift your arm." Is that trance if they lift their arm? But, if you start shading the communication using this unusual language of hypnosis, I don't know when your arm can begin to lift now. Do you? And then suddenly, the person starts lifting their arm in response to the implied message or even more, alymbicated(ph) than that would be telling a series of stories. You know, as a child, the patient is hypnotized. You know, as a child, you've had the experience of having questions. And you want to know this is the right time to make your question known. And as a child, you've had the experience of going into the kitchen, and you see those cookies up on the shelf. And you really want one now. And as a child, you had the experience of sitting, being seated in the car and the back window's open. And suddenly you want to know what it's like to feel those currents of air. And then suddenly, the person starts to lift their arm in dissociated response to the implication of the communication. Well, at that moment, we could say that the induction is over. The induction is over when the person starts to respond to the implication of the communication. And to me, that social responsiveness is the, is fundamental to hypnosis. And, other people have said relaxation is fundamental. Other people have said focused attention is fundamental. And other people have said dissociation is fundamental. But, what I would say to you is that responsiveness is fundamental. Now, the context is important , because the context explicitly or implicitly we define as trance. And, explicitly we could say, okay, now we're going to do hypnosis, and we imply an induction. But, by the way, that wasn't what Dr. Erickson did most of the time. Most of the time Dr. Erickson would be sitting there, and he would be talking to you, and then suddenly he would shift the tone and the tempo in the direction of his voice, and I am going to remind you of something that happened a long time ago. And implicitly he was defining the situation as hypnosis. Building responsiveness to the meaning of the communication, building responsiveness to the psychological level of communication, building responsiveness to nuance. And it's at the moment when the person starts to respond to the nuances that we can say that trance exists. So, trance is a syndrome. It's an amalgamation of some series of these components that are unknown to us when we start working with the patient. One patient needs two components. One needs four. One needs one. We don't know which components of this person going to need, and even worse, we don't know which components are going to change over time. So, trance is a process. It is not something that is a static thing. And, were going to be able to elicit trance by eliciting these components. And in order to elicit these components, we need a new vocabulary, and expressive vocabulary that will help us to get these components to be elicited in a implied way, and in a responsive way. So, these three components, attention, intensity and dissociation, are psychological. And this component, responsiveness, is social. This is a hypnotic conversation. It's a hypnotic communication. And, this component, defining the situation as hypnosis, is contextual. So, hypnosis is a psychosocial contextual amalgamation. And when we can put those components into effect, and we have the technology for putting those components into effect, trance emerges. We are using the wrong vocabulary. Ernest Rossi pointed this out. We talk about inducing hypnosis, which sounds like I'm doing something to you. Hypnosis is elicited by putting onto the stage, the person's psychological stages a series of components. Like, we invite the person. Would you like to change your attention? We invite the person implicitly. Would you enjoy changing the intensity of your experience? Would you enjoy having a dissociative experience, not so much different than driving the ca well or the way in which you use the gas and the brake? Would you like to start to respond to the implication of the communication, not so different than two people walking down the shopping mall and suddenly coordinating their steps or two people sitting next to each other who are strangers, who suddenly communicate, suddenly coordinate their nonverbal behavior. This nice lady in the maroon sweater and the lady in the turquoise sweater, who are sitting in this coordinated way. You two aren't married, are you? No, I'm teasing, of course. So, if we bring together those kind of components, we bring together those components. It may be that the person says, "Oh, I'm in a trance." Now, we need ways of doing it. And the ways of doing it fall into this language of hypnosis. It wasn't the way that Erickson taught me. He did say, "Jeff, if you want to help people to change their attention, use a truism." He, uh, just understood here we are. Here's where we want to go. And, he invented using truisms and yes sets and implied causatives and dissociation statements. Somebody else came along and categorize them and said, "Okay, well this is a dissociation statement, and this is a presupposition and this is a truism." And they made a very proper British Rose Garden, when Erickson himself was an explorer who was just hacking his way through a jungle, trying to find paths that worked. And unfortunately, or fortunately we do have this as a, in a codified form. So, okay, so now those handouts you have. This next handout you have too. And, now we get to the complicated part. We need a different poetic language, and we can call this poetic language the micro dynamic gift wrapping of possibilities. Were not going to tell people what to think. We're not going to tell people what the feel. We're going to be Seurat. Seurat, the pointillist painter, Monet the Impressionist painter. We're just going to create impressions. Were going to allow the person to elicit their own response as we paint this canvas of impressions in these four areas. When I'm hypnotizing a person, I'm hallucinating that diamond. I'm covering all those bases. So, one thing we can do is we can use direct suggestion. We can say to this person, "Go into a trance." And if they go into a trance, you don't have to do much else. Erickson was an expert at direct as well as indirect suggestion. And now we have these common forms of indirect suggestion. And this is the essential part of the content, and this is the part that's challenging because it would be like I'm saying to you, "How do you do the,uh, how do you make some of the genitive and datative cases if you're speaking in German." And, this is challenging for English speakers because it's just such a different way of thinking about creating language. So, truisms, embedded commands, quotes, yes sets, presupposition, dissociation statements, double dissociation statements and implied causatives. These are all linguistic forms that we use in order to elicit those four phenomenological effects, five if you include context. And each of these forms is designed specifically for getting a, an affect. So, truisms we can start with, and I'm sure Brent started you here. Did Brent start you with truisms? Yeah. So, if I say you are here. That's a truism. Thus, you're here. If I say you're happy, that's not necessarily a truism because it may not be that you're happy. If I say you can be happy, and they use a permissive verb, that's true. And contrary to our way of writing language, where we've been instructed not to use permissive verbs, in hypnosis my language is filled with permissive verbs. And it's the kind of benevolent, and it's suggestive. You can be happy. You can feel comfortable. You can close your eyes. You can go inside. And those are truisms. And those truisms are primarily used for guiding our attention. So, you can listen to my voice, is a truism, but it guides your attention. If I say you can feel the comfort. You can really feel the comfort of sitting in the chair. You can notice your feet are on the floor. Those are truisms, but they guide your attention. So primarily, when we're using truisms we're doing this because that's what want to accomplish. We want to guide people's attention. Now, sometimes we create a form that called a tagged question. When you look at videotapes of Erickson in the 60s, you see that he used a lot of tagged questions, and he batches positive to negative. You can listen to my voice, can you not? You can understand my words, can you not? You can realize the meaning of my words, can you not? And you can begin to use my words to go into trance, can you not? Now that, sounds hypnotic doesn't it? Nod your head slowly. So, these tagged questions are an unusual form of grammar, because you don't go to the restaurant and say to the waiter, "You can give me the menu, can you not?" That would be ridiculous, because that, that, we would just be wanting to use informative communication not expressive communication, but when we want to help somebody to change their state, we need some different language forms that are based in expressive communication. Now, once we get truisms which by the way, are like the fundamental particles, like electrons. You need these fundamental particles in order to create the atoms, and maybe we'd say, maybe that's the wrong metaphor. Maybe we would say that truisms are atoms. They're fundamental atoms like hydrogen. And you need these hydrogen atoms, carbon atoms to create larger forms. Let's say the truisms are carbon atoms. Well, a form that we can do is we can't link three truisms and follow with the fourth truism. Did Brent cover that? And this would be a yes set. So, you can listen to the sounds of my voice. You can hear the sounds of people in the room. You can experience the sounds of your own breathing. And you can experience the sound changes as you go inside. So, the yes set is, if it were a dance, it would be step, step, step, larger step. And it would be based on Newton's second law that once a head is nodding yes, it tends to continue to nod yes unless it's acted upon by an outside force. Just getting the person into the mentality of thinking yes. Now this is a directed truism. And because these forms can become complicated and multiple level. One of the things that we know that influences the human heart is increasing the density of the information. Commercials are incredibly dense and they move us. And they do that by implication. I just want to hammer home this theme of implication. There was a commercial that was recently on television. And there was a piÃ±ata. And there's a little boy. The little boy has got stick, and he's hitting the piÃ±ata. Mexican tradition for those of you who don't know it. And usually there's candy and things that come out of the piÃ±ata and the little boy was having a celebration, bursts the piÃ±ata open. Will the boy is using all of his force and he can't break the piÃ±ata. And then slowly the piÃ±ata turns, because it's a, it's a car. And as it turns and faces you, you see the emblem "VW". Then, you see a real VW going down the street. Then there's another quick jump cut, and the children have given up and the father now has a bat, and the father is hitting the piÃ±ata with all of his force, and it doesn't break. Now, this is not a Aesop's fable. They don't end by saying, "And, Volkswagens are tough." They don't give you the moral. They just create an implication in your mind, and you feel the, the weight of that implication. And, we as psychologists had to teach marketing people at one time, and now the marketing people have accelerated way past us, and they understand psychological level communication better than we do. So, this is a directed yes set, going from distant, closer, closer, inside. And we could add something about the structure that makes the yes set not only guide their attention to sound, but also direct our attention from external to internal. You can remember a feeling of comfort as a little child. You can really realize the feeling of comfort, remember the feeling of comfort that you had when you were in grade school. You can really remembers some recent experience of a pleasant peaceful comforting feeling. And you can now go inside and realize for you that comfortable feeling. And it's a directed yes set." And I'm going from the distant past to the present, and we learn to create these works as ways of guiding people's attention. Now, a second form that we can use is a form that we call an embedded command. And we have a phenomenological goal, and the goal could be listen to my voice, guide the attention. And then we're going to pause after the permissive verb. And English is a remarkable language for creating embedded commands, because although you can do this a little bit in French, and I believe you can do this in Chinese, Mandarin, you can't do this easily in Spanish. You can't do this easily in German, but there is tricks that you could use in those languages that we can't use in ours. Because, listen to my voice is actually an embedded command. You can listen to my voice. So now, I took the truism and I took part of the truism out, listen to my voice, and I softened my voice. And I made the suggestive part, the expressive part, stand out by softening my voice. I remember I had a patient who was referred to me by Dr. Erickson. She was a patient of Dr. Erickson. She came to me, Jane. She was an engineer, not anything. Didn't know anything about psychology or psychotherapy. She came to me, and she said she wanted dental hypnosis. And she wanted not to have to have anesthesia. Could I do hypnosis so she wouldn't have to have Novocain. And I said sure, and I did this induction the best that I could do at the time. And I'm saying, "And Jane, you can really feel comfortable. And Jane, you can just be aware of your body. And Jane, you can just realize the comfort in your feet." And she came out of the trance. She said, "Jeff, that was great. It was exactly what I needed, but remember when Dr. Erickson used embedded commands, he softened his voice." So, I paid her for supervision and sent her home. So, this is another way of guiding our attention. It's another way of making our communication more dense, like the commercial. And it's another way of building a focus of attention. So, we create embedded commands. There's many ways, but I'll give you four them. Pausing after a permissive verb. You can focus inside. Now is that a statement of fact or is that a suggestion? And it's a little bit dissonant, because you don't know exactly is that a directive or is that just a statement of fact? And if so, it puts you slightly off balance. You're creating a little dissonance. It's okay, we struggle, we, we struggle with the fact that psychotherapists are so vanilla. We're always nice. We never create any dissonance in our communication, but Baptist preachers know that creating dissonances a way of moving people and establishing the feeling of faith. So, we can use a little dissonance in our communication. Splitting an infinitive, which again happens curiously in English. It's nice to focus inside. Or inserting the person's name. It's nice to, John, focus inside. Or, repetition. It's nice to focus, focus inside. And, we are having a recursion. Were having ways of presenting information so that that information can be felt, experienced. People need to go into trance and get the felt sense of being in trance, not the cognitive understanding. And, another form that we use is the form called quotes. I said to my friend, "Focus inside." And quotes can be used in any language so, if you're working in Italian or Portuguese, you can easily use quotes. Now, the second most important form that is elemental like carbon and oxygen to create carbon dioxide. Most of my inductions are composed of truisms and presuppositions. And a presupposition is taking a truism, you can go into a trance, putting a clause in front of it, I don't know, and then using a, what you call those when/how conditionals? Conditional something. I don't remember the grammar quite right. Conditional adjective? Where's my grammarians? Oh good, nobody knows. Well, you put those things in there. I don't know when, what? It's not a conjunction. It's not a conjunction. I don't know when. It's a conditional something. I don't know when you can go into trance. And then, it's just a matter of time. It presupposes you go into trance. I don't know when you'll pay your registration for coming to the couples conference in April? Do you? It presupposes that you're going to do it. It's just a matter of when. So, we create presuppositions by using things like when, where, how, how deeply. And these are presuppositions of time, place, process or quantity. You can't possibly master this in a short period of time. Just be with it, feel your way through it as you advance in your learning of hypnosis, these things will become second nature to you. But right now, it's like driving a car and somebody's telling you, you know, how to hold the wheel. And it's just challenging. But, pretty soon you're driving the car, having a conversation, planning your day and listening to the radio at the same time. But at first, it's quite daunting. I don't know when can go into trance. You don't know where you can go into trance. Your conscious mind doesn't know how you can go into trance. Your conscious mind doesn't know how deeply you can go into trance. Presupposition of time, place, process, quantity. And presuppositions are used in a little different way, so usually were using presuppositions if we want to change intensity. If we want to make a change in attention, we'll use yes sets. If we want to offer a change in intensity, we will probably use presuppositions. Many ways of creating presuppositions. I don't tell people to relax. I don't even remember the last time I said to somebody, relax. In trance you can relax. Even more powerful, you can enjoy relaxation. You can enjoy comfort. You can enjoy tranquility. You can realize tranquility. You can experience a sense of peace. And this is a presupposition by using an auxiliary verb or using adverbs. You can relax comfortably. You can relax easily. You can relax quickly. You can relax peacefully. And those are ways of creating presuppositions. And then we can double up on those presuppositions. Now, if we need to get responsiveness, we need a different form. And here, where putting together two truisms or two presupposition in a when then form, and we call this an implied causative. When you take a deep breath, then you can really go inside. Now, those are not related. But, one is a behavior, and one is an experience. Did I tell you about Jefflag and how quickly things go, and how dense everything becomes? I hope that your, your following me and that your okay with this. Are we okay? Okay, great. Because it's a lot of density of information, and we have to get into the experiential component too quickly. When you experience trance comfort, then you can take a deep breath. And then you're seeing the response. You need to be able to see that this person is responding to the meaning of your communication. So the purpose of the implied causative is to see a response. So, this is our table. We would use truisms to guide attention. We would use embedded commands to guide attention. We would use quotes to guide attention. Yes sets, guide attention. Presuppositions, alter intensity. Dissociation statements, which we haven't gotten to because we need a different language to formulate dissociation. And implied causatives to check on responsiveness. And so, we would cover our four bases, attention, intensity, dissociation and responsiveness, and we would have poetic expressive language forms that would help us to get each one of these effects. Now, let's see if we can get into the dissociation statements. And, let's, let's, let's do it this way. We, we have a charming volunteer. Would you be the charming volunteer? Okay. And we'll have you sign the form afterwards. You can sign afterwards. I get to do the prerogative on this. Okay. So, your name is? Amida(ph)? Okay. And, you have the option of enjoying going into trance. Uh huh? And, I have the option of practicing a technique, okay? So, I'm going to be focusing a lot on the, practicing the technique. And you're free to use any of those ideas to foster your own experience. So, the first thing that you can do, is that you can begin by just allowing yourself to take an easy breath, so that you can effortlessly follow with another easy breath, so that you can pleasantly close your eyes. And you can close your eyes so nicely. And you can close your eyes so easily. And just as comfortably and easily, you can realize that you have a conscious mind. And you have an unconscious mind. And your conscious mind can listen to my voice while you're unconscious mind can begin to go inside. Begin to go inside, because it's nice to just allow yourself to experience, experience a wonderful feeling of comfort. And a wonderful growing sense of well-being. And you can realize that your feet, your feet can rest on the floor. While it can seem as if your mind can wander inside. And this secure inside yourself a sense of ease. And a sense of well-being. And your ears, you ears can listen to my words while your body can explore delightful feelings. Explore delightful, delightful feelings of well-being, can you not? Because all along you can learn that trance is something, something you can realize in the body. Your experience. And your conscious mind can notice, notice the fluttering of your eyelids while you're inner mind, your inner mind can explore, explore more peaceful and comfortable sensations. And your conscious mind can listen while your unconscious mind can explore comfort. Or your unconscious mind can attend while your conscious mind can realize feelings of comfort and well-being. And your head can rest easily and comfortably on your neck. And your mind can explore the rest. Explore the rest inside. And the way in which those feelings can comfortably alight. And the way in which the images can suddenly float across your mind's eye in the way in which that uplifting floating feeling can be so delightful, so charming and so utterly disarming. And then in a moment, I'm just going to touch you right hand, and it's a very light sensation and curiously, even though the contact is no longer there, the sensation , the sensation can be there. And the sensation can remain. The sensation can develop. And then in a moment I'm just going to just lift your hand so that you can feel yourself effortlessly suspended. And that's a curious sensation, to feel yourself so effortlessly suspended. And you can experience the warmth of my voice in your mind. And you can realize the warmth that you can have, that can be in the air and the way in which that hand and arm can begin to move effortlessly toward your face, in little steps so that when that hand touches your face, you can use that as a signal to with your eyes closed, just gently look up to the top of your head and take an easy breath and allow yourself to experience even more of that sense of the delightful comfort inside, because you're listening and you're learning and your understanding and you're realizing some things about the autonomy of your body. And you didn't have that normal sense of just touching your face and allowing your hand to move back down. But now your hand can begin to move back down to your lap. And there's a little bit of disorientation, not understanding exactly where your hand and arm are in space and time. And then that hand and arm can rest easily peacefully on your lap. 

06:48:55
[sil.] 

06:48:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And that alteration of time, so interesting. And then you can begin to reorient yourself and begin to bring yourself back. And you can do that easily and fluidly, freely and comfortably. Just take one or two or three easy breaths, and then bring yourself back fully alert and rested and refreshed and energetic and wide-awake all over. Hi. That was fun. What was that like? really fun. Yeah. So, help, help us to understand a little bit. You can take this. Tell us what was it like. 

06:49:50
UNKNOWN I don't know. It was, uh, very, I didn't realize, I mean. I felt really light, like normally it would be hard to hold your hand up, and it felt completely light. 

06:50:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Effortless. 

06:50:05
UNKNOWN Effortless and it was just. 

06:50:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, so it was a dissociative. 

06:50:10
UNKNOWN Relaxing. 

06:50:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Relaxing? So, the intensity of experience, the dissociation, the lightness of your hand, those were convincing? 

06:50:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

06:50:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

06:50:20
UNKNOWN I'm very surprised. I, I guess after today I, I really came into this thinking I wouldn't be able to be hypnotized. And, uh, after the sessions, and especially now I'm really amazed. 

06:50:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, so delighted. 

06:50:35
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

06:50:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Surprised. A little bit surprised, but now delighted because you have a talent that you can begin to explore and learn how to utilize. Yeah. 

06:50:45
UNKNOWN Absolutely. You're amazing. 

06:50:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Great. I couldn't have done it without you. So, tell me more. What else did you experience? What else is going on mentally, physically, emotionally? 

06:50:55
UNKNOWN Just, just very relaxing. I, I'm getting very warm. Like, I had warmth all over, and I tend to be always freezing, which was amazing. Just, just this warmth that came over me. Relaxation. 

06:51:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Where did that come from, the warmth? 

06:51:10
UNKNOWN I don't know. I guess the good memories, the processing of them. 

06:51:20
JEFFREY ZEIG What were the good memories? 

06:51:20
UNKNOWN Just about, you know, being on vacation and being in a good place with friends and family. 

06:51:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. So, an essential part of this is I'm just supplying the climate. She's, she's on vacation. I just, you know, I'm just applying the bare-bones outline, but the richness of her experience is much more intense than anything that I could possibly know, than anything I could possibly suggest. Uh huh? 

06:51:55
UNKNOWN And it was completely, all of my senses were involved. Smell, taste, touch. I mean, it was just, it wasn't just thinking about something. It was like re-experiencing the event. 

06:52:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And some of those sensations that you were feeling, some of those memories. What did they have to do with what I was saying? 

06:52:10
UNKNOWN Just I guess a place that I was really relaxed and in a good place and felt loved and comfortable and surrounded by people that cared about me and that I cared about them. And just a wonderful place. 

06:52:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. Essentially, you can't say what the cues were that you are responding to, right? 

06:52:35
UNKNOWN No. 

06:52:35
JEFFREY ZEIG But, this is the same thing as going to a movie you're watching a commercial. You get a felt sense but you really don't know the cues. Now, I had to know the grammar that I was using. I had to know cognitively the techniques that I was using. But, for you, you didn't want to know the techniques. You didn't want to analyze whether I was using yes sets or presuppositions or implied causitives. 

06:53:00
UNKNOWN I just wanted to stay there. 

06:53:00
JEFFREY ZEIG You wanted to have the experience. Okay. Case closed. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. And, so that is the essential part. The person who is doing the induction they need to know the grammar, but the person who's experiencing it needs to be seamless because if they turned it into information, then it is science and it is not an expressive art. And, that is, that was a great example, a wonderful example. So this is what I want you to know for today, and then I want you to practice this because curiously what I did was he essentially create a series of five or six dissociation statements. And I did an induction that was a little bit rigid and a little bit formulaic. I just created five or six dissociation statements. It was not anything that I would ever really do with the patient and especially if I was working with a borderline patient. I wouldn't want to use such ambiguous forms of communication, but if I was working with the patient with pain and really needed to disassociate, I might coordinate my induction and use more dissociation. So, what I was doing here, three steps. Remember, yes set, the yes set dance is step, step, step, larger step. The dissociation statement is enter, offer, exit. You know this pattern because you've seen it 10,000 times in movies. In movie language it is called clean entrance, presentation, clean exit. Movies communicate in triplets. You see the office building, the entrance. You're inside the office, presentation. The music trails you into the next scene, clean exit. And the only person in the history of psychotherapy who communicated in triplicates was Milton Erickson. And he was consistently communicating in triplets. And I was a Jungian, a Rogerian(ph), and I was communicating staccato. It seems like you're happy today. It seems like you're really interested. And there was Erickson, and he was communicating in triplets. You're here and you're listening and your understanding and you can take a deep breath and close your eyes because it's so interesting, so delightful to go inside. Now, if you take away nothing from this lecture other than this idea of set up, intervene, follow through. It will change your way of communicating to patients and giving them suggestions to exercise or go on the diet or stop smoking or any of the things that you're going to suggest. Another example. Right. You're a little bit confused, you're a little bit uncertain, a little bit insecure, but there are things that you can realize about the process of communication because it's going to make you more powerful. It's going to make you more impactful. Going to make you a better communicator. Set up, intervene, follow through. And this is the structure of the dissociation statement. Your conscious mind can listen to my voice. That is setup. It's a pacing statement. It's possible. Your conscious mind can listen to my voice, but your unconscious mind can explore comfort. So, my entry is specific and pacing. And the middle part, the offering is ambiguous, giving the person an opportunity to, to experience something in response to that ambiguity. Your feet can't rest on the floor while your mind can float because it can be so delightful to do things inside. So, I'm starting with the pacing statement, pacing. I'm offering with the leading statement and I'm ending with a motivating statement, because it's delightful. It's interesting. It's unusual. And what I did with the induction is that I created a series of dissociation statements, and I was practicing creating dissociation statements. Now, in the middle of doing all those dissociation statements, I used some presuppositions, I use some truisms. I used some yes sets. But basically, dissociation statements. Your feet can rest on the floor. And your mind can float, because it can be so nice to experience a floating comfort. And, lots of things that you can do, but as an example, your conscious mind can notice the sensations of your feet on the floor. Pacing. But, your unconscious mind can enjoy floating because it's nice to experience many different facets of developing awareness. Just some general motivation. We're here to learn, to experience, to enjoy. Now for those of you in the advanced class, here's the double dissociation statement. Your conscious mind can listen to my voice while your unconscious mind can explore comfort inside or your unconscious mind can listen to my voice while your conscious mind can explore comfort inside. And so, against the background of that disharmony, that, that internal noise, conscious/unconscious, unconscious/conscious, is listen to my voice, explore the comfort inside. Listen to my voice, explore the comfort inside. And Erickson invented these forms. They didn't exist before Milton Erickson, and people who came along after him, they just categorized. So, this is my exercise for you, because we need to have you practice this idea, which is to, uh, find a partner and my way of reorienting is different than other people's. My way of reorienting, take one or two or three deep breaths. Bring yourself back rested, refreshed, energetic, wide-awake. My way of orienting the person then, you can take a deep breath, follow with another easy breath, close your eyes. Then, your conscious mind can listen to my voice while your unconscious mind can explore the comfort inside. And what I want you to do is to practice creating these dissociation statements. You don't need to do the arm levitation. You just need to practice making five or six dissociation statements and practice this language form. We're now in the "Karate Kid". If you remember the movie, wax on, wax off. Wax on, wax off. Practice this pattern. So find some stranger to work with, somebody who you don't know and will never see again. And practice this pattern of using dissociation statements with each other. Okay now, this this is the difference between direct and indirect suggestion. If I say, "Please stop. Please stop. It's time to stop." You know, people may or may not respond. But, if I use an indirect suggestion, a gesture, "Shhh" and I appeal to a history from kindergarten on, you start to respond. And, this is one of the lessons of hypnosis. It's a lesson of social psychology. It's how people respond to the meaning of communication. And, my wife would at an earlier panel was quoting a neuroscientist, and I, I, she had the quote correctly. I'll bastardize it. And the neuroscientists said that the conscious mind is like the stowaway on a luxury liner who believes that he's in control the ship when he has no understanding of the under structure. And what we're learning about modern neuroscience is how people respond to the implication of the communication. Hypnosis is built on this. So, the lesson is many of you will not pursue what I have done, which is a 40 year excursion into trying to develop some degree of mastery at doing hypnosis and then transmitting it passionately around the world. But, hypnosis has really changed my life. It's changed my way of thinking about how people respond. It's changed my systemic understanding of the nature of communication, and it's changed the way that I do psychotherapy. And, Ericsson only used hypnosis one five, 15 percent of the time. But 100 percent of the time he was using ideas, techniques from hypnosis, expressive ideas, making therapy into an expressive art. And, not making therapy into, into science that could be transmitted by, by virtue of information. So, I may have said that wrong. I didn't mean to be so exaggerated in that plane, because certainly science is really important. And it's important that we define and quantify what we're doing. But, in this particular case, I hope that I have oriented you into the future. These are the things that you're going to learn. These are the things that you're going to pursue. These are the things that you can use in your everyday practice and explore as you develop some interest and expertise in hypnosis. I hope that from the Erickson Foundation, we'll now send you information about how you might continue your learning and develop, uh, more expertise. And, I'm very grateful to all of you for coming in for your support of the Foundation, and I hope that you have a wonderful meeting. I have to leave quickly, because I have faculty responsibilities. Thank you so much.
