RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. Rich Simon here from Psychotherapy Networker. Welcome to this webcast on the emotion revolution. Over this, uh, course of these next several weeks, we're gonna be talking with another, a number of prominent therapists in the field about various ways in which they engage, actively engage their client's emotional experience in the consulting room. And as we, uh, all know the various influences, brain science being one of them, more and more, we come to recognise the role that emotion plays, uh, whether we label it emotion of not in guiding us or motivating us through life and, and, in the context of therapy, a very central force in directing the course of therapy and, uh, leading in the, uh, potentially, leading towards healing outcomes is the role of working with emotion, and we're very fortunate today to have with us someone who's been very instrumental in bringing emotion into the kind of the, the, the crosshairs of the therapeutic radar, um, the, the developer of Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy, my good friend and colleague, Sue Johnson. Sue, welcome! 

00:01:30
SUSAN JOHNSON Hey, Rich! Nice to be here. 

00:01:35
RICH SIMON It's very nice to have you. So let's get into it. So, um, it, you inspired the issue that we, uh, published back in May on emotion in the consulting room, and, uh, we've had a number of conversations on this topic, and one of the things that you have talked about and critiqued is a kind of discomfort that many therapists, in your view, have with the direct experience of emotion in the consulting room. 

00:02:05
SUSAN JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:02:05
RICH SIMON So you and the, and, and, uh, if I can quote you, the therapist, in your view, often seem to regard emotion as something strange and scary. Now what, we're supposed to experts on emotional experience, aren't we? What, um, what makes you think that many of us regard emotion as such a strange and scary experience in our consulting rooms? 

00:02:25
SUSAN JOHNSON Well, I think we come by it honestly. I think, um, I mean we're just, we've lived in this society, we're a reflection of this society. You know, um, if you go back to Descartes talking about "I think, therefore I am," I mean all those years ago, hundreds of years ago, it was almost like society, um, decided that the most, literally the most, the highest expression of human beings and the part of our brain that was sort of linked us to the angels and to the spirit was our reasoning part of our brain. 

00:03:05
RICH SIMON Mmhmm. 

00:03:05
SUSAN JOHNSON So, um, we fell in love in a way with how clever we were and how, you know, this, this prefrontal cortex of ours was incredibly powerful, and part of that was we demonized the other piece of our brain Descartes talked about, the emotion was the primitive animal, the animal side of us, and so the idea was we had to rise above it. We had to somehow rise above it and never trust it and be able to really go into our minds, right? And use our minds and control our emotion, and I think that was a general societal thing in, in Western societies. So, you know, it's not strange that therapists would've gone there as well, but I also think that in couple and family therapy, um, people got hung up on conflict, and they got hung up on watching, trying to help people and families and couples in conflict, and they said, "Oh, look at all this terrible, out-of-control angry emotion, you know, hurt feelings, and obviously this is an issue, and what we have to do is, uh, contain them, help people out of them." I can remember when I was a graduate student, um, watching some, uh, Canadian therapist, I can't remember his name now, but basically what he would do is when the couple became upset with each other, he would stop the session and ask one of them to leave and go outside and calm down. And then he'd basically say, "Naughty, naughty," you know, "You're getting too emotional. Go away, calm down, become and adult, restore, you know, your reflective faculties, and then come back in, and we'll teach you, you know, communication skills and how to have insight." And I can remember looking at this as a beginning therapist and thinking, goodness me. You'd be asking people to leave all the time. You know, you'd hardly have any people in your office for... But, um, that was the kind of idea, and, and the other thing about that one is I think if you don't trust something, you don't particularly understand it, and so you don't know how to use it, it makes absolute sense to avoid it in therapy. 

00:05:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:05:25
SUSAN JOHNSON But what has happened, particularly over the last 30 years, and I'm, I feel proud that EFT, Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy, has been part of this, I think also attachment, seeing human personality and human development and in terms of attachment has been part of this, what has happened is that we have started to understand emotion, and as we've started to understand it, I think, then it seems not to be so strange and not so foreign. And we've also started to really look at it. I mean, in, in EFT, um, for couples, it's very clear of study after study after study -- there's about 16 outcome studies on EFT now with all kinds of different partners, but the results are consistent that the people who can have these highly emotional conversations, putting out these softer emotions to each other, talking about their fears and their emotional needs to each other in the second stage of EFT, um, that absolutely predicts that they're going to have repaired their relationship at the end of therapy and that two or three years time in follow-up, they'll be just fine. So we've always seen the power of emotion in EFT, um, and I think that's what it is. It's, you know, for us, yes, it's difficult, especially to deal with a couple in conflict, especially... You know, emotions are very strong. They can sweep you up; they can sweep the therapist up, you know. But the bottom-line is, if you know how to use them and create these incredible, uh, emotional conversations, the power of them is amazing. You know, it's, it's sort of a double-edged sword, Rich. Um, the academic way of saying it is that the emotion theorists talk about the fact that emotion has what they call "control precedence". In other words, if, if you're feeling strong emotion, it's gonna wipe out everything else. 

00:07:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:30
SUSAN JOHNSON And I think, you know, that is true and that's why it worries us, because we don't, you know. 

00:07:35
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's-- So let's, let's, so what we're gonna be doing in this conversation, and so we're addressing an audience of therapists who are, uh, and, and we're going to be, uh, I hope, uh, talking about how you do what you just said, and some of the tools that you use and, and, and hopefully give people some idea of, at least in a preliminary way, of how they might orient their practice in a somewhat different way, handle some situation, uh, in a, in a way that invites, uh, uh, a deeper kind of emotional experience. So it seems to me that there are two parts to the territory I'd like to cover. To begin with, let's talk a little bit about your understanding of, uh, the nature of emotion and what, what is this thing that we call emotion. And then we'll, we'll move, uh, we'll talk a bit about that so we have a bit of a map of the territory, and then we'll, if, uh, we'll talk a bit more about some of the methods and how you actually operate. To me, one of the, the, the really important, uh, distinctions in this roadmap that you've created through your work and the way you've applied attachment theory and, and understanding what goes on with your couples and in your approach to therapy is this distinction you make between primary and secondary emotions. 

00:08:55
SUSAN JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:08:55
RICH SIMON So let's start off with that. What's the difference between primary and secondary emotion, and why is that so important for us as therapists? 

00:09:05
SUSAN JOHNSON Well, I think it's important, you know, you start to just sort of unpack emotion and start to look at it and look at the structure of it, and one of the things that's very clear is even in our own experience, there's different levels. So if a couple coming to your office, for example, the classic couple in North America, you're gonna see surface emotion. And usually what you see is one person is reactive and angry, and that's distressing to the other partner; it can be distressing to the, to the therapist. They interrupt, you know, they're, they're frustrated, they complain, right? They're, they, um, dismiss their partners comments. They're angry. Usually what you see on the other side is an incredible attempt to suppress emotion. So you see a numbing out. You see somebody trying to turn their emotion off. And we think of both of those as sort of surface, um, responses. It's almost like they're try, their, their coping mech-- they're real emotions but they're kind of almost coping mechanisms. You know: I don't get really angry unless there's something hurting me or scaring me, unless there's a more basic response underneath that, right? My anger is reactive, especially in relationships, and I'm not desperately trying to numb out and avoid looking at you and avoid, and trying desperately to turn all my emotions off unless there's something going here that I'm feeling overwhelmed by, that's making me feel helpless. 

00:10:35
RICH SIMON So there's the secondary emotion... is what you're describing now is the secondary emotion, and the primary-- 

00:10:40
SUSAN JOHNSON This is surface. 

00:10:45
RICH SIMON Is not, surface or secondary. Okay. 

00:10:45
SUSAN JOHNSON Yeah. And underneath, a particularly -- attachment helps us understand this -- I mean, underneath these, this reactive anger and this surface sort of, um, you know, numbing out, not becoming emotional, if you listen to people and you sort of join with them and help them move into their emotion, you'll hear basic deeper emotions coming up, especially what you hear is attachment fears. You hear sadness, you hear hurt feelings, um, you know, the physical feeling of pain. People say, "When she talks to me like this, it, I feel this pain in my chest," or, "My stomach clenches, I can't breathe." You know, you hear a sense of hopelessness. You hear fear. Fear of rejection, fear of abandonment. 

00:11:35
RICH SIMON Mmhmm. 

00:11:35
SUSAN JOHNSON I mean, this is usually kind of what's going on at the deeper level, but the couple often don't tune into their own emotions, can't even tell you what their softer emotions are and certainly don't tell their partner. So one person, you know -- emotions communicate with other, they communicate with us. They tell us what's important and what we need. They move us into the dance with our partner. 

00:12:00
RICH SIMON Internally. 

00:12:00
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes, internally they motivate us, they move us, they, and they, they come, they order our experience, they tell us what matters, they tell us what we need, and they communicate. Emotions are the music of the dance with a, a couple. They, they orientate us to each other, so, you know, tuning into the emotional music with a couple, there's always these two levels of what they say on the surface and then when you slow them down, these softer, more deeper emotions coming out, and they often don't tune into themselves, so they can't... If you say, "How are you feeling right now as you say this?" Somebody says to you, "Well, I feel angry, but, but I don't even know why I'm angry. I think, I don't know how I feel." And I say, "Well, as you say this, your eyes fill with tears." And they say, "Oh! Um, yes, well, I guess I'm sad." But, you know, but they say it in an angry -- "I guess I'm sad!" I say, "Well, and if you stay with that sadness..." and they say, "Stay with the sadness? Um..." And then if you do, if you stay with the sadness and focus them on that, they start to explore it. It's not often a place they go, let alone tell their partner about. And just what we're just saying right now... If you think about the consequences of that, the partner is married to somebody's who's angry all the time. That's the music of the dance that they're trying to adapt to, and they never hear this soft emotion of how their, their partner is also sad and feeling vulnerable. 

00:13:45
RICH SIMON So one of the things that you do, and, and, uh, to focus people on, on the some of the tools that you developed, and ways in which you shift the conversation, so you're trying to create this atmosphere of safety in the consulting room, and you have this, this wonderful, uh, concept of the three S's that are, uh, seems like the hallmark of a great deal of what F, EFT therapists do. Tell us about the three S's. 

00:14:10
SUSAN JOHNSON I can't remember what they are! 

00:14:15
RICH SIMON I have them if you need it. 

00:14:15
SUSAN JOHNSON One of them, one of them's got to be slow. 

00:14:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:14:20
SUSAN JOHNSON One of them's got to be slow. 

00:14:20
RICH SIMON Okay. Good. 

00:14:25
SUSAN JOHNSON And one of the issues with emotion is emotion is fast. And this is good because emotion is an information processing survival system. It's supposed to be fast. It's supposed to make you run to save your life. 

00:14:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:14:35
SUSAN JOHNSON But it's also a problem. Because it's very fast, and so people don't know how to process it, so you, if you want people to stay with their emotion, feel their feelings differently so they can engage and create some new music to their partner, create new interactions, you have to slow stuff down. 

00:14:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:14:55
SUSAN JOHNSON So you slow the emotion down, and the other part is you keep it simple. 

00:15:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:15:05
SUSAN JOHNSON Um, people get all intellectual. They'll talk about the emotion rather than feel it. If you want to reshape and explore an emotion and sort of find out how it directs this dance, you have to stay stimple. If you go, they have to feel it, not talk about it. You know, it's an experience not an explanation. And people will exit into cognitions, and you'll see a good EFT therapist go back to the emotions. 

00:15:35
RICH SIMON And so how does that sound, when you've gotten somebody who is spinning, and what's the kind of thing that you say that gets them into simplicity. 

00:15:45
SUSAN JOHNSON Oh, well you, I just went and did an externship in California, and Californians can really talk about their emotion, you know. And so, um, I can't remember exactly, but I'll say to somebody, "Right now, you, you... Could help me? Right now, it's almost like you've pulled your chair back. It's almost like there's something scary here. And she says, "Yes, maybe there's something scary. But, you know, in these situations, you know, there's obviously all kind of abandonment issues, and what, probably what we need is some catharsis around the abandonment issues." And here we are, we've, we've just exited, right? And I say, "Mmhmm. Um yes, well, you know, abandonments a big word, and I'm a little confused right now. Could we please go back, could we go back to the moment before you pushed your chair back? What was happening for you?" So I'll bring them back out of the cognition, into the emotional experience, but I'll use simple language. So slow, you know, simple, and we use a soft voice. 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:17:00
SUSAN JOHNSON Um, that's, I think, about holding the person. You can hold somebody with your voice. It's a, it's a fascinating thing to me that it's so true that if say to my students, "If you're going to talk to somebody about the softer emotion, and you do it high and fast, it doesn't work. Even if you say the same content. 

00:17:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:17:20
SUSAN JOHNSON Because if I start talking to you, if you just listen to the music, if I go da da da da da da da da da, it's almost like I'm inviting you into your prefrontal cortex to sort out what I'm saying. If I go da da da da da da da. 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Mmhmm. 

00:17:40
SUSAN JOHNSON Da da da da da, you know, it's almost like I invite you to slow down, stay with me, go into your experience, so, um, you know, simple, slow and soft are what we teach our therapists. There's other S's, Rich, that's why I'm getting confused. 

00:18:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:18:00
SUSAN JOHNSON But those are the key ones, I think. Um, you know, we make up these acronyms and then I sort of forget kind of what exactly they mean, um, but it's important how you do it, and I think one of the key things that we talk about is that you go into somebody's emotion with them, particularly their softer emotions, which aren't, they're not used to walking around in, sometimes they actually feel quite ashamed of them. You know, they're not supposed to feel this hurt. I'm supposed to be an adult that can cope with everything kind of thing. And at the way you go in, the fact that you slow down and you stay with somebody, and you validate, you join with the emotion, don't see it as the enemy, you say, "You have a right to this feeling. This feeling makes sense. Emotions do make sense. There's nothing irrational about emotions." That's a huge thing that I just said compared to our attitude. Emotions do make sense, and you help somebody touch their emotion, put it together and order it. So when they can stain, if you're gonna change emotion, make it bigger. You have to be, you have to touch it. You can't do it from a distance. So you help them touch it, but they're not overwhelmed by it, because you're there, creating safety and helping them order it. Then emotion becomes massively useful. Because in that emotion is what they, what they're really longing for from their partner, what they're really afraid of, the impact their partner has on them. I mean, there's an enormous amount of incredible, um, you know, information in there, right? That, but you, the therapist needs to be able to see emotion as a friend rather than an enemy, join with it, create safety and help the person touch it and order it. 

00:19:55
RICH SIMON Okay, so, um, and, as a, as a good, uh, disciple of yours, and having absorbed the, that lesson, let's see if we can apply the, these three S's in showing people that process. So, somebody's coming in, and typically what you're, where we started this conversation was they're difficult, vulnerable, primary emotions that we, couples typically don't wanna show each other. There are secondary emotions that they have developed that they use to, um, keep each other at some distance, to, in their own view, reduce their level of upset. They use those secondary emotions to balance, regulate their, their sense of despair about their relationship. 

00:20:45
SUSAN JOHNSON They use them to try and keep their emotional balance, but the trouble is their way of keeping their emotional balance also pushes the other person away. That's the issue. 

00:20:55
RICH SIMON It's counter-productive. Okay. In terms of how you evolve a conversation, how you actually work with somebody, uh, if, if we were to kinda give people a sense of the kind of things that you say and do in your way of thinking about the, the process of this, this change, what's going on in the therapy. How, how -- can we, um, so if we're, the, we're, we've, you've capped characters early on, the typical situation where people are, how they present themselves, how many couples present themselves in your offices. So what is it that you're doing that's gonna make a difference in that process and really how does it sound? What are some of the ways that the most important and most impactful ways in which you apply the three S's to making a, a shift in these relationship patterns? 

00:21:45
SUSAN JOHNSON Well, I think first of all, um, you know, when a couple first come in, it's important from an EFT point of view that you don't try to persuade them out of their emotions or give them better ways to cope with them and tell them, "If only you weren't so angry" -- I've seen people do this -- "If only you weren't so unreasonable and angry, um, maybe your partner would want to be with you more." Ouch, ouch, ouch! Okay. The alliance has just gone straight over a cliff, all right? Forgt it, okay? So, um, what, what John Bowlby said, who's the, um, father of attachment theory, I think him and Carl Rogers would've got along very well, what John Bowlby said is if you go to a widow who is grieving her husband, and who is, comes in amazingly angry, and you get the feeling that if the husband was sitting in the other chair, the widow would actually be saying to him, "How dare you have died! You son of a bitch! You died!" He says there's no point in, you know, trying to stop that lady being angry or problem solving or telling her to grow up or to, you know. You go and you join her in the emotion, and you help her process it further. So she's angry in some ways because it's easier. She's angry at the loss. She feels overwhelmed, and it's easier to start by being angry than to feel her helplessness. And when we feel helpless, we do get angry. We protest, you know. How dare the universe do this to me. You know, it's like, well, it's very human. So, um, when a couple come in, what we do all the time is we usually start by reflecting process. And that means reflecting the emotions, reflecting the music, and reflecting the dance. So we'll say to a couple, a couple say, "The issue is parenting. The issue is sex." Well, the issue is not those things, the issue is how they talk to each other, and the fact that they send each other signals in a way that they're both scaring the hell out of each other and there's no safe connection or, you know, they can't work anything out. So the issue is how they talk. So first of all, we'll just reflect the process and say, "Could you help me? Whenever you talk about this issue, I noticed here is the dance that happens in the relationship." And we'll reflect the emotional signals. You get very angry with your husband, you tell him, um, "You don't listen to a word I say, you don't care about my feelings." And this comes up in this parenting issue, and it comes up with you talk about sex, but basically, you get, you're, you're, most of the time, you're angry and you're telling him, "you don't care about my feelings, you're not there for me." And she says, "Yes, that's right." And I say, "And can you help me. When you talk to your wife, it's almost like your face is flat and still. And you, it's almost like you put all your emotions away in the closet, so she can't really see you. You're almost invisible. Um, and you sort of try to reason her out of her emotions, and you try to feel as little as possible. Is that right?" He says, "Yes." I say, "Oh, so what this struggle is about is you shut down your feelings. It just seems too much to deal with. You feel overwhelmed, and as you do that, you shut her out. And when you feel shut out, you get angrier and angrier and angrier. And these are the music you play to each other all the time, and both of you are falling through space off-balance, hurt and alone, and this is the problem." So right from the beginning, the way they regulate their emotion, and the signals they send, and the way they dance together, it frames the problem. But in doing that, we help people. I mean, we do help people regulate their affect in that we, we show them that they're both caught in this dreadful dance, and that they're scaring each other, and we help them see the process they're caught in. You know, um, she is not a crazy person who is too needy. She is somebody who feels completely desperate because she experiences her husband as behind a wall all the time. So we make it situational, we make it about, my emotions are about your emotions. You're, they're about the dance between us. They're not about the fact that I'm a crazy person, right? And we help people see the whole dance and see how they somehow distort their emotional messages to their partner, and that they are holding back much softer feelings, right? That could be used to create closeness. So we kind of deescalate the negative cycle, help them order their negative emotions, right? And create more safety. Once we have the safety -- 

00:26:50
RICH SIMON Okay, let me just -- 

00:26:50
SUSAN JOHNSON Once we have the safety -- 

00:26:50
RICH SIMON Let's just stay with that for a second. Yeah, cuz that's, that's, that's great. So now, um, so that, that first stage, so you're, clearly you're changing a lot by not trying to change very much. 

00:27:05
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes. 

00:27:05
RICH SIMON So you are -- Okay, so you're, you're creating an atmosphere which, it makes sense, it's what, what each partner is doing makes sense, and you're getting a language, uh, to them that they may not have for themselves, and you're giving, now the tricky part of this is it seems like there's a, a invitation for people to let down their guard, there's an invitation in both the three S style with which you address people and the way in which you're creating this dance, but it also seems like that's a very tricky point for people coming in; are they ready to expose themselves? Are they ready to even acknowledge that they have a primary vulnerable emotion? How do you, so how do you extend, how do you not overextend that invitation? And how do you, it seems to me that that's part of the first challenge, isn't it, in the style of therapy that you do, is how do you get people to eh, uh, have the, um, whatever-it-takes to acknowledge a vulnerability? Otherwise they would not. 

00:28:10
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes. And, to be honest, I think it helps amazingly for EFT therapists that they have a map to that. That they, that they have an, it's about attachment and that they understand, like in the article I did in The Networker, that there are certain elements to emotion and that there are only certain core emotions, and in attachment situations when we can't connect with our partner, and we're distressed, the main emotions that are gonna come up on a softer level are sadness and loss, um, fear, a sense of helplessness, rejection or abandonment. Usually the blaming person feels abandonment, the withdrawn person feels rejection, you know, and mostly it's about sadness and fear and sometimes about shame, which is, I'm not gonna let you close to me, because if I let you close to me, you won't like what you see. I'm really quite flawed as a person. And so I am gonna keep hiding, and so if you have this map, so when somebody says to me, for example, as a cliche, I say, "What happens to you as--" It's easy to create emotion in couples therapy, because the most powerful emotional cue is sitting in the other chair. If you can't create emotion, you get her to talk to him, he's emotional. He, if he's not, you know, so when he says, "I feel nothing," I say, "How do you feel as your partner says she should never have married you." He says, "Fine. She says this stuff all the time. I feel nothing." So inside my head, I say, "Well, unless you're dead, and if you're a mammal, there's no way you can be feeling nothing, and it helps for me to know that. You, it's wired in that you'll be threatened by that. Okay, it's impossible that you'll feel nothing. So what do I know? I know that in fact you are working like mad to try and feel nothing. You are, and the physiologically that is very difficult for you. Suppression of emotion stresses you, and it's very physiologically expensive, so you're pushing it down. So all I've got to do, and I know this from research and from EFT is just stay there. You can't keep it up. You just can't." So I say, I present the cue again. I say, "You feel nothing? As your lady turns and says that when she looks at the distress in this relationship, she actually regrets choosing to be with you?" And the guy goes, "Um... well, it's difficult." So that's great. "Oh, it's difficult." You know, and then you, we know how to expand it. We can, if you look at the elements of emotion, there's always in the body. "What happens to you when you talk about this?" "Well, I just feel tight in my chest and like I don't wanna talk about it." "So if this was at home, what would you do when you felt that tightness in your chest, and you'd prefer to feel nothing, but in fact there's something very difficult there?" Look what I've just done. I've put all the elements together, and he says, "I'd leave." "I understand. So this difficult feeling, this feeling in your chest, the minute you feel it, you leave." He says, "Yes, that's right." And then she gets angry. "But if you stay here right now, can you feel that difficulty in your chest? What does it, what do you hear if you listen to it?" And you're going for the meaning now. He says, "She doesn't wanna be with me. She's never loved me. Um, she married me on the rebound, and every day in this relationship, I feel about the, I recognize the fact that really, um, she's going to leave, and there's nothing I can do, and it's hopeless, and it's been hopeless from the beginning." Now, if I really feel that, if I really feel that, what am I gonna do? I'm going to shut down and try and, you know, shut down that feeling of hopelessness and just kind of deal with you on a, a level that I can handle. So then you, you put the emotion together, and you order it for him. You say, "So in these situations, when your wife gets angry and turns and says this, this is what happens to you in your body, this is the meaning is has for you, and then you turn and you run. And she feels that you leave her. And this is what's been happening." Now look what I've done, I've, I've, in a safe way, in a simple way, with no blaming, I've gone in, and I've walked around and ordered and named his experience for him. There is some evidence by a man called Lieberman that in a difficult situations, if you present people with nasty images, even helping them name the emotions they have calms the amygdala down. Almost like the amygdala's saying, "What's that, what's that, what's that? That's, that's scary, that's dangerous, that's, that's a threat." And it's almost like if you say, "It's a lizard," the amygdala goes, "Oh. Okay. It's a lizard. That's not so bad." You know. "I'm still scared, but it's not so bad." So we help people name the emotions, we help them regulate them, and we order them, so then at the end of the first stage of EFT, you get a man who three sessions before or five sessions before had said, "I'm not an emotional person. I really don't know what you mean. Um, I don't really feel anything when she says these things," right? Suddenly, he's able to turn to his partner in an argument at home and say, "This is one of these times when I start to feel overwhelmed, when I get that tightness in my chest. And this is one of these times when all I wanna do is run, and it's like we're in that pattern that we talk about with the therapist. We're in the vortex where I run, and then you're gonna get angrier, right? This is one of these times. I'm just having such a hard time, cuz I wanna run, cuz I don't know what else to do." And if we've done our job, he's sending, he's putting his emotional experience together in a new way, and that means he sends new signals to his partner. And if she can start to respond, she can say, "Oh, yes, you're right. We are going into the vortex, and I'm getting really angry with you, but you know what? I really appreciate you taking the risk of saying what you just said." And they're able to come into the therapist next week and say, "We got out of it. We got out of that horrible thing that we do, where I'm just angry all the time, and he's just numbed out. We got out of it." Um, and, see, what they're doing there is they're changing the dance that constantly has them terrifying each other. They're being able to contain the negative emotions, but in EFT, that's not enough. 

00:35:25
RICH SIMON So let me stop you there for a second, just so we can punctuate it for the people listening to this. So we're just, you're describing what you call as this first phase and what, what I'm getting from this with your three S's, with your creating this atmosphere of safety, with your weighing in there and helping people to develop each partner to develop their, a map of all these rather fragmenting and disturbing emotional experience in that soft and patient, non-blaming style, you're working primarily, what I'm getting so far, with that individually, there's not a lot of conversation that they're having with each other. You're laying the groundwork. 

00:36:05
SUSAN JOHNSON Well no, you do ask them to enact -- Rich, I'm sorry. Thank you for making that point. When they move into a new emotion, you ask them right then and there to share it. So I would say to that man, I've been saying to him all through therapy, "So could you help your wife understand what that word uncomfortable or difficult means for you? Can you help her understand what's happening to you when you get this feeling in your chest and you just wanna run?" So I've been helping them create little enactments, little conversations, all the way through, where they learn out to take new experience and turn it into a new signal. We do that all along. 

00:36:45
RICH SIMON And there's primary emotions that are shared, primary emotions that are more, there's more vulnerability... 

00:36:50
SUSAN JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:36:50
RICH SIMON That are harder to share. So the fire and brimstone, they don't need your help in sharing that, but when there's an experience that goes beneath these secondary, more defensive emotions, you're helping them to, to verbalize that and connect with each other around that. 

00:37:10
SUSAN JOHNSON And what we understand is that we understand what those emotions are all about because we have an attachment frame, and in an attachment frame, you know, um, your partner turns on what Jaak Panksepp, who's an emotional researcher, calls primal panic, when they reject you and abandon you, and that's because you're a mammal. It's got nothing to do with how clever you are or how many PhD's you have or whether you're a therapist or a bus driver, it's just cuz you're a mammal, okay? So, um, and we don't have many ways of dealing with that, so, you know, we have a map that helps us explain the emotion, make sense of the emotion for us, and I think that is gold. Because if the therapist doesn't have a way of understanding what's going on, the emotional drama and the emotions, the therapists gets overwhelmed, the therapists can't go in and help the couple go back to a place of emotional balance, you know? It's, um, it's... and help them sort of learn how to turn towards each other and help them sort of balance each other. I mean, in a way in the second stage of EFT, what we do is we teach people how to help each other with their emotions so that they can help each other back into emotional balance, and then learn to dance with each other. 

00:38:30
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's get into, so that's, that, so by the end of this first stage, they've had some experience of moving out from behind this defensive wall, sharing the more primary, more vulnerable feelings, uh, changing the, uh, so just changing the dance to a certain extent, and then, uh, and then, so at the point that that's happened, that the, they have begun to develop a map of what's going on, there's a, a shift in the therapy? There's a, a, in your, there's a somewhat different emphasis on what you're, what you're trying to accomplish? 

00:39:05
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes, because by that time, people, um, know a little bit about these softer emotions and what they're all about, okay, and so they're not in foreign territory. And they know that they can go there without falling apart or going crazy or hurting forever. We have all these deep fears about what's gonna happen if we're deeply emotional in this society, right? Um, and they trust the therapist, so once we get to a place where there's a certain emotional balance, we have, we sort of de-escalated these negative dances, these incredibly negative messages that couples send each other that just create these horrible patterns of pursuing and withdrawing, they've got a certain emotional balance, then it's almost like what we say to them is, "Okay, now for stage two: you have to be able to create positive cycles of positive connection. You have to, if you want to secure attachment bond, be able to stay with those softer feelings and taken them to your partner and get your partner to respond and help, get your partners help with them, so you have to then create positive cycles of trust and caring and that's a different way of regulating your emotion." It's like, if we have a safe connection, I can turn to you when I feel vulnerable and tell you about it and it's like I trust that you'll be there for me. I can reach for you with my emotion. I can say, "Gee, Rich, um, you know, doing these webinars with you is, is terrifying." They're not, but you know how it is, it's terrifying! 

00:40:50
RICH SIMON Only to me. Only to me. 

00:40:50
SUSAN JOHNSON It's terrifying, Rich, and if we've got a good, secure relationship, I could risk saying that to you, and that you would respond to me, and you would say, "Oh, Sue, it's okay, it's a conversation. We're just gonna chat." You'd reassure me, and not just from your words but from your physical response to me. You'd smile, you'd reach toward me. I'd go, "It's all right," right? And what I've just describe to you is an amazingly functional, efficient, powerful way of dealing with difficult emotion. In fact, most neuroscientists would now tell you it's the very best way. We've got hung up on that I should be able to go away and self-soothe and do yoga for ten years or something, right? And actually, it's much more efficient and effective, me be able to turn to you and say, "Well, I'm a little bit scared, right now?" and for you to say, "Really? Oh, you don't have to--" 

00:41:50
RICH SIMON Me too, me too! 

00:41:55
SUSAN JOHNSON So, um, we, in the second stage of EFT, we help people stay in those attachment fears, those softer more primary feelings, and explore them, make sense of them, order them and then give coherent, clear signals to their partner so that pulls their partner towards them. It changes their inner experience, and it changes the dance. So for example, a withdrawn man, the man who said I feel nothing. I feel nothing. 

00:42:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:42:30
SUSAN JOHNSON Right? I'm good at it. I know how to turn everything off, right? So, um, you know, what he turns to his wife and says in stage two is, "I'm so scared I'm not gonna do it right. In my family, if you did, you had to know how to do everything right. If you couldn't do everything right, and if you got upset, they'd send you to your room, and if you couldn't do things right, you were like, that was it, you, you didn't belong. So I'm so scared of failing. I get so tense when I think, when you tell me that I'm disappointing you. I get, I get, I go into a panic and I get overwhelmed, and I just numb it out, but you know what? I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna do that. And I want you, I'm telling you I'm scared in these situations. I'm not indifferent. I'm telling you, I might go flat and still, but it's cuz I'm frozen and I do wanna know how to to talk to you, and I want to feel safe enough to be able to turn and say to you, 'I feel confused right now, I don't know what to say. I'm so worried I'll say the wrong thing. And I, I want you to trust that I'm trying to do that, because what I need--'" And see, here's the thing. When you can plug into emotions, softer emotions, they tell you what you need. That's what they're designed to do. "‘What I need from you is the message that you love me. And that you want to be with me even if I can't always say things the way you want me to, and that you, that you'll help me learn how to do this. I need the reassurance.'" Now that's the man that just a few weeks before said, "Oh well, you know, I don't feel anything when she says she's gonna leave me. I guess it's okay." 

00:44:20
RICH SIMON Okay. This is lovely, and, and what a wonderful transformation and how great for this guy and for this couple and what, and so that's how it sounds when they've successfully moved through this process. So it would seem to me this is not our birthright, most of us do not, um, learn in our families of origin how to have such conversations. We don't see a lot of other people in our lives having this kind of conversation, so what is the EFT therapist doing, and how much coaching and teaching as well as invitation is involved in getting this guy from the point that you described so vividly early on to this point, this very touching point where he's able to be so emotionally expressive. 

00:45:10
SUSAN JOHNSON Well, we don't think of it as coaching, because coaching is sort of like top-down, like I sort of tell you how to do it. Your prefrontal cortex is, you know, I engage it. We think about it as bottom-up. It's like we invite you into the experience. We make it safe for you. We order it. We understand what it means. We invite you into the experience and then we stand beside you, and we sort of walk around in it with you. We regulate, we tune into your emotion with you and we regulate your emotion, so you can order it and get your balance and then, and we help you do that in a very collaborative way, okay? And occasionally, we'll suggest if you're very stuck, we'll say could you help me -- uncomfortable. Could you help me when, are you uncomfortable right now? What was, what, what was the cue for comfortable? When your wife looks away like that, and where do you feel it and what do you say to yourself? So we'll help people put it together, but where we do get directive, especially in the second stage of EFT, is we structure the enactments more to keep the safety. So we say to somebody, "Could you turn and tell your partner right now?" And if they go off in their head and say, "Yes, now what was I talking about? I think I was talking to her about the stock market." No you weren't. You know, you were actually talking to her about that feeling in your chest, right? We go, we structure it. The other thing we do is we help the other person-- 

00:46:50
RICH SIMON Just stay with that for a second, and we'll get to the second part, but you structure it. So tell us, show us and, and give us, uh, the sound of what it's like, how you structure it. 

00:47:00
SUSAN JOHNSON Well, if he talks about five different things, we'll go for the key words he uses. In every person, we call them emotional handles, and we'll write them down, because people will use them from session to session. So this man will talk about going frozen, so we'll say, and I think what you're doing, when he goes off track into, you know, how his uncle said he should never have talked to anyone about these feelings, so we come back and we say, "But I think you're talking to your wife about this frozen feeling and the hurt that's underneath." We'll bring him back. We'll help him refocus. And the message we give all the time is that people are entitled to their feelings, their feelings make sense, there's nothing wrong with their emotions, and that they can trust their emotions and their emotions are workable. So the attitude of the therapist is crucial, crucial, crucial. If you get panicked and you suddenly go into coping mode and say, "Don't you think it would be better is you tried not to feel so upset and listened to your partner--" It's finished. You've just messed it, okay? So you stay and help somebody order their emotion and touch it and then there comes the point where you say "Could you tell your partner?" And you help them craft a coherent, simple message. "Could you tell your partner please? I turn away because I'm so scared. I'm so overwhelmed." 

00:48:35
RICH SIMON Use, use some language that they might use. 

00:48:40
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes. 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:48:40
SUSAN JOHNSON And you'll use their language if you can, but you'll keep it simple, because if they, you know, people who have been in therapy a lot, you say, "Could you tell your partner," and half an hour later, they haven't finished, right? And you can see the partner going, "Ahhh!" No, no, no, no. This is the key bit: "Could you tell you partner," Then where you do get directive, and you, if you're gonna, if an EFT is a coach at all, it's in creating these enactments. You'll help the partner respond. So if the partner... this person has come out and, and taken a risk, right? EFT is systemic not just about experiential emotion, so the partner will come out and take a risk. They're processing their emotion in new way, and they're vulnerable, right? And the other person doesn't trust it. So the other person says, "Yes, well, it's okay for you talk about that now, but last night--" Listen to her voice, right? So the EFT therapist will stop her, say, "Could we stop for a minute? Thank you. Your partner turned and said this, right?" And you just repeat it. "‘Could you help me?' That's hard for you to hear. What happens to you when you hear--" And you process her, her inability to respond to his new emotion, his new emotional expressions. You process it with her. You don't allow the couples to do what they do at home when somebody takes a risk and goes into their softer feelings, which is to freeze each other out or smack each other. I mean, that's why these cycles keep going for 28 years, you know? People say, "We've been doing this for 28 years," you know. Um, so you structure the enactments so that people can put out their softer feelings, and you help the other person see it and respond to it. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON So and, part of what I, I, the other thing that's coming through as you're, as you're, uh, dramatizing, uh, with, with, uh, so, uh, so, with such clarity and vividness what goes on in the session is that there's this, um, what's demanded of the therapist, in a sense, you're, you're trying on a person's, you're inside the person's nervous system to a certain extent. 

00:51:00
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes! 

00:51:00
RICH SIMON And you're a cartographer. So you're both a, a co-participant and there's this, uh, this cartography that's going on-- 

00:51:05
SUSAN JOHNSON That's right. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON So you're, you're dipping into the stream and then you're, you're, you're creating word pictures, you're using their language, you're suggesting some new language, and between the two of you, with each, each of the partners, you're developing this map, and then for the couple together, you're developing this shared map, and, and when it works and, and you, you, you seem to have a pretty impressive, uh, uh, uh, track record from all accounts. 

00:51:35
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes, we do. 

00:51:35
RICH SIMON That, that you're able to do that at, uh, at both levels, that, you both partners, you have a credibility with both partners in their ability to tap into their individual experiences and this, this overall map of what-- 

00:51:45
SUSAN JOHNSON And don't forget, don't forget that you have the most amazing motivating factor known to man built into this process. If you know how to tap in to it and you understand it, you have something called attachment longing. I wanna tell you there's nothing like attachment longing for getting people to jump off cliffs and take risks that they never even knew were possible before. If somebody sees the chance for secure connection, even if they've never experienced it, this is wired into their brain, they'll go for it if you give them half a chance. I mean, we work with incest survivors, we work with people who learned in their childhood that it was terribly, terrible idea to open up and, and reach for anyone, and if you give them half a chance, they'll do it. 

00:52:35
RICH SIMON So let's get concrete about that. So when people come in there, attachment longing is typically well disguised. That's what we were, been talking, the first part of our conversation about, so as, in your experience as a therapist, what are the moments in which this attachment longing and so this fellow who you were role-played a few moments before, who'd gone from, "I have no feelings," to being able to express this attachment longing, uh, with some eloquence, um, how do you, what are the first indications that something's shifted, that this attachment longing is coming to the surface, and what are the kinds of ways that these very tender moments that can be so profound for a couple, how you move them along. Can you give us the flavor for how this emergence in the course of-- 

00:53:25
SUSAN JOHNSON Well, we call them hold-me-tight conversations. You know, my, the book I wrote for the public in 2008 was trying to take all this and, and turn it into the public understanding, these processes, but we call them hold-me-tight conversations, and I think the key thing and the reason why you can't do this top-down by going through skill sequences and instructing people what to say to each other is that emotional messages are through non-verbals, most of them. So you, you know when somebody's going into their softer feelings by their voice, they expression on their face. And when that man turns and gives that signal to his partner, if you can help her turn and look at him and stay focused on his face, you can see the attachment longing and the vulnerability on his face and in his voice. You know, good example of this is in our work on forgiveness. When a couple have tried to heal injuries, they've gone through the motions, they've used the words a thousand times. "I'm sorry, okay?" No, it doesn't work. Doesn't work. But what does work is for you to tell me your pain and for you to look into my face as you say your pain and for you to see that your pain hurts me and for me to say with all kinds of emotional cues coming from my body, "I don't want you to hurt. I feel so bad that you hurt. I feel so bad that I was part of that hurt. I don't want you to hurt. It hurts me that you hurt." That works, okay? So it's about the level of emotion engagement, not the... so you can't give people the words from top-down, you, you stay with them and you track their emotion. You help them put it together, and you help him turn and say to her, you know, "I wanna be with you, but I'm so scared I don't know how. I do shut you out." You help him say it from a place of emotional engagement, and you help him say it in a coherent way, and then you watch her face, and you track her emotion, and, you know, if she goes, you say, "What just happened there? There's something, could you help me? My sense is, you've longed for your husband to reach for you all these years, but now it's hard to let it in." And she says, "Reach for me?" You say, "Yeah." And she, she's so, she says, "Is that what he's doing?" We say, "Yeah! Look." And you go over again, you rerun it. Look at what he just did, he just -- and she goes, "Oh. Um, hm." And I say, "Could you help me, you're confused right now?" And she says, "Well, is it real?" Basically what she says: "Is it real?" Right? "Can I really, can I trust this?" You, and so then you help her say, "Part of me hears you, and part of, and hearing you turns on all this longing in me, but that's a bit scary, so part of me hears you, and part of me wants to be careful here and say to you, ‘Really? You're really, this is really you?'" Right? So you help her say that, and you help the couple stay engaged and create these... the conversations that securely attached people can have, if you want securely attached people, whether it's mother and child, partners, you know, siblings even, right? If you watch them, you know, securely attached people can keep their emotional balance, tune into their own emotions, give clear signals to their partner, invite them to come close, reach, can tolerate if their partner can't always just turn, they have enough trust to tolerate the partner sort of dancing about a bit, you know, not always being able to hear, and to stay there and reach and then responding in kind to the partner. That's what securely attached people can do, and it's a, a beautiful emotional dance, but it's on the emotional level. It doesn't work on a, a skill level, or just teaching it from top-down. You know, if I say, "Can you turn and tell your partner this?" It doesn't work. 

00:58:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:58:05
SUSAN JOHNSON Wrong level, right? But these bonding conversations are massively moving, and they move the therapist. What we tell therapists who are a bit scared of emotion is, we say, um, "Listen, um, emotion is scary, but you know what? You can get used to it, and if you want to be inspired in your practice and go home humming at the end of a day, if you've created one hold-me-tight conversation in your office, you're gonna go home humming. You know, it's like, um, that, it's like I think I said, I think I said to you before, somebody asked Bruce Springsteen once when he was gonna retire, because, you know, music's hard work and a bit like therapy, you know it's hard work and it's, and he said, "Why would I ever retire? When I play, men weep and women dance? Why would I ever stop?" And I think that is a bit like an EFT therapist. When you can create this incredible emotion, and it joins people together, and they can suddenly realize that they, they can get their needs met. There's all kinds of positive emotion. There's joy, there's surprise, and a deep sense of peace and contentment and security. I mean, if you could be part of that, hey, um, it, it really helps for things like burn-out, and, and you know, you wanna keep doing it. I mean, I, you know, um, you wanna keep doing it, right? 

00:59:40
RICH SIMON This seems like a, a wonderful Bruce Springsteenian moment for our finale for this conversation. Um, so if, uh, and in a moment we'll, let's, uh, we'll, for a moment you'll let people know about resources and how they can find out more about this. So the, so in your view, people who are not working, currently working in this style of engagement, of, uh, moving so deeply into the people's longings and to their, their, this attachment longing and, and moving outside of, uh, the normal constrained emotional range most of us live our lives in, what's, is, is there a, what's the, the first step. How does, how does one reorient oneself if one's been working as a more cognitive therapist, skill-based therapist, to moving in this direction? Of course there are, you know, there's a whole process of learning models of therapy. What's the shift here? What's the, what's the fundamental shift that you think is important in embracing the style of work that you've been describing for us for the last hour? 

01:00:45
SUSAN JOHNSON Well, if, if I was, if I was gonna do that, I think first of all, I would, um, maybe just, um, listen to this conversation and, and I'd invite people to think about what, where are they with emotion? How safe do they feel with their own emotions? Do they feel they understand emotions? When do they get scared in their offices or in their own lives? So to get to know what you do with emotion, do you usually avoid it? Do you up it and get all freaked out and freak yourself out like I used to do in a plane, years ago, and then I came phobic of flying, you know, because I'd just listen to the motors all the time and tell myself I was gonna die. This isn't helpful. Okay, so, you know, what do you do? So it's an invitation, we were all emotional. We all struggle with emotion, but then I would read something like Hold Me Tight, because if you're, if this is totally foreign to you, Hold Me Tight was written for the public, but it's got a lot of science in it, and it's talking about emotion and the new positive take on emotion. Um, and I'd maybe get, um, some of the training tapes of the people who, so you can see it, rather than trying to learn it cognitively. 

01:02:00
RICH SIMON You can't read it from a book. 

01:02:00
SUSAN JOHNSON I'd get some of the training tapes of my wonderful colleagues that are on this webinar with us that you've just told me about, I'd get some, I'd go on our website, which is www.iceeft -- iceeft.com, the International Center for Excellence and Emotional Focused Therapy, and look at some of the training tapes we have. We have one we just put out last year, which is called EFT in action, which is me, um, listening to a man talking about a case of an Iraqi vet, and the key thing that's happened there, his PTSD symptoms, he's completely numbed out. And he's shut his wife out. And as he's completely numbed out, she's become more and more desperate, hysterical, angry, you know, and, and now their cycle is actually feeding his PTSD symptoms. So he's getting more numb, she's getting angrier, the relationship's going down the tube. He's getting more numb, he's getting more afraid, more isolated inside. You can just see it, right? And it's me working, and you can see me working with a very escalated couple. 

01:03:10
RICH SIMON Get the flavor of it. 

01:03:10
SUSAN JOHNSON Yes, so I'd go watch it, and then, hey, what am I gonna say, Rich? I'd go read the books on EFT. I'd go read the 2004 book, The Practice of Emotionally Focused Therapy. I'd do the workbook, which has got all these exercises on how to work with emotion, and the answers are in the back. You know, so you can, you can go do the exercise, if the couple says this to you, what do you do, and you can look at the answers in the back as to what an EFT therapist would do, or I'd find someone in your community, the ICEEFT website has all kinds of, there's something like 25, um, EFT communities and centers all over the U.S., and often there's a, a group in your town, even if there's not a formal community and center. Find some colleagues, because we're all the same here. We're all... EFT is a, a sort of, we're all turkeys in the turkey soup type therapy, you know. We're all the same. We're all trying to understand our emotions, we're all trying to find the best way of dealing with them, we're all sending confusing emotional messages to the people we love at times. We're all overwhelmed sometimes. Sometimes we can use our emotions as an inner compass, and we know that it's good, and we know that emotions make us feel alive, and tell, tell us who we are and what we need. We're all struggling with this all the time. So, um, you know, I would go and read some of the EFT stuff, um, and I'd listen to all the other people in this webinar.

RICH SIMON Excellent suggestion. All right? That's great. So, I'm gonna invite, uh, people who, uh, you'll see on your screen all of the, all of you who have been listening to this conversation, we're interested in your comments. This is the, the, uh, first session of our series, so the more folks that join into this conversation, the more ripple effects, uh, the more we all benefit. Individually we benefit by just taking a moment. What'd you think, what'd you learn, what questions do you have, what, maybe what you didn't buy? Whatever it is, whatever your response happened to be, uh, it's impossible, as we, we've just shown, to resist Sue, so it, whatever you do, it's, um, it's part of this turkey soup. Uh, in any case, we invite this, uh, conversation to continue. Sue in her gracious way has agreed to look at the comment board. She hasn't guaranteed she'll respond to everybody, but she'll be quite interested in response, and she may very well, if some will respond to, to your particular question or your comment. Sue, thank you so much for this great conversation.
