SIDNEY SHAW Hello I'm Dr. Sidney Shaw. I'm a faculty member in the clinical mental health counseling program at Walden University. And I'm here with my colleague, Dr. Stephanie Ford, to chat about multicultural orientation and cultural humility. This video is an extension of my article from January 2017, uh… in counseling today on that same topic. So what we're going to be doing today is chatting a bit about multicultural orientation and how we can use this model as counselors to improve our effectiveness and increase culturally responsive counseling. In addition to our dialogue between Doctor Ford and I, we're also going to watch, umm… a clinical session with myself and a client. And Dr. Ford and I will provide some analysis of that session through the lens of multicultural orientation and cultural humility. 

00:01:15
How Sidney and Stephanie became interested in multiculturalism and cultural humility 

00:01:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD I actually became interested in this topic from my experience as a graduate student. But even before that as a woman of color, I knew at a very young age that I wanted to enter into the counseling profession. I just didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. Uh… But what I did realize once I became a graduate student was that as a person of color, the issue of cultural diversity always entered into the counseling session with me because of my physical appearance. So I had the privilege of training at a historically black college and university to learn more about counseling and clinical psychology. As I went through my doctoral studies, and practicing uh… supervision, and learning supervision, I began to encounter numerous occasions to talk about culture. In fact, there was one incident that occurred with a supervisee where I broached the topic of culture and she went to my supervisor and thought that I was implying she was a racist. So for me, early on, I had a commitment to understand how cultural diversity influences the relationship between the counselor, the client, as well as, the supervisee. I want to say it is my privilege to join you today for this particular video. I am Stephanie J.W. Ford, and I serve as a field experience coordinator for the school of counseling at Walden University. 

00:02:45
SIDNEY SHAW You know, for myself, I became interested in a similar way as you, in the sense that, going to university was influential. I had some professors that really opened my eyes to the importance of multicultural, psychology and multiculturalism in our country. And there was one pivotal moment that really changed my thoughts about this, umm… in a very practical way. I'd worked for about four years as a counselor. And so I had some experience under my belt, and I felt fairly confident in my abilities. And at that time I started working for a native umm… health care clinic. And we provided services in rural Alaska. And so I was getting ready for my first trip to fly out to a native village, very remote, uh… small airplane. And I remember walking around, feeling very confident and eager to fly out and my mentality was that I was going to go do some healing. You know, I was… I had acquired some specialized training. And I feel pretty confident and I think my supervisor saw me and my general demeanor, and I may have seemed a little overconfident, and I believe he saw some lack of awareness. And he said to me before I got on the plane, he said, "Sidney, I want you to remember that people in these villages have a long history of white people flying in who were intending to help." And it sort of stopped me in my tracks. And I realized I had this large lack of awareness about my identity, how I might be received, and, in a sense, I was really lacking cultural humility in that moment. And so I'm very grateful for him for giving me kind of a reality check to pause and self reflect on the… the mindset that I was bringing into that endeavor. And that really pushed me in a direction of learning more about how my own background influences my worldview, how other people may experience me because of their history, and in general just learning about the history of… of umm… marginalized populations. 

00:04:50
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sure. I appreciate you sharing that story. And as we begin to explore a multicultural orientation, I just want to share with you how eye-opening it is when we have experiences like the one you describe. I recall being new in the profession and having the opportunity to train in uh… Cameroon. And I'll never forget… I thought, well, we're gonna go in here and we're going to talk with the juveniles and I'm going to focus on global self-esteem. And I'll never forget that, umm… Dr. Lanier said, "Stephanie, stop thinking with your western hat. Self-esteem doesn't exist here." So I think your example of working with individuals and Native American culture and my experiences in Cameroon really are the impetus for the work that we're doing today. And I'm very grateful that we had those eye-opening in those challenging moments because without that experience it wouldn't have given you the opportunity to do the research and to publish the articles. So I want to thank you for that and for allowing me to be a part of this discussion.

Definitions of Multicultural Orientation and Multicultural Humility 

00:05:55
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD My multicultural orientation refers to how a client perceives the cultural sensitivity and knowledge of culture by the therapist. According to Owen et al. Multicultural orientation is based and rooted in the client's perspective. When we consider the definition of multicultural orientation, it is also important to explore the three domains of multicultural orientation. The three domains consist of cultural humility, cultural opportunities, and cultural comfort. Cultural humility consist of interpersonal and intra personal processes. Interpersonally, cultural humility is the ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other oriented or open to the other, in relation to aspects of cultural identity that are most important to the person, according to Hooke's et al. in 2013. Interpersonally, cultural humility encompasses counselor's openness to accepting their own cultural identities and experiences that will limit their perspective and awareness and understanding the cultural experience of others. Let's move on to cultural opportunities. Cultural opportunities are the moments within a session where there is an opening to directly attuned to a client's cultural identity. Cultural comfort is the level of comfort that the counselor demonstrates in engaging clients and therapeutic conversations related to the client's cultural identities. Sidney, I do want to acknowledge as we discuss the multicultural orientation, it's important to note that what we see is that cultural humility is a big component of that. It's really important for us to be mindful of how we are experiencing the client and the session but most important how the client is experiencing us in the counseling session. Before we continue, I do want to note that cultural humility actually comes out of the work of social workers and in the medical profession. So I want to acknowledge Travalin and Marie Garcia for the work that they've done and how it really has been a launching pad for what we're doing in the counseling profession. 

00:08:35
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that, Stephanie, that's a really good point. And one of the things that it emphasizes for me is just how in our field we're constantly developing and building new information on top of previous existing research. You know, Jesse Owen and Joshua Hook have been two of the fore runners most recently of multicultural orientation and cultural humility. As you mentioned it's a big part of that. And I think that's a good transition to talk about something that a lot of students and counselors may be more familiar with than multicultural orientation given that it's a relatively new construct and that is multicultural competencies, umm… which were developed several decades ago by Derald Sue and his colleagues and have formed, you know, kind of, a foundation for how multicultural work is considered in our field. And it has a lot to offer. But we're gonna draw some distinctions between multicultural orientation and multicultural competencies. Umm… As you know, multicultural competencies basically is comprised of three different domains, awareness, knowledge, and skills. And awareness really refers to counselor's awareness of their own cultural background and how that influences their attitudes, beliefs, and worldview. And also awareness that culture influences the worldviews of clients. And the second piece, knowledge is… counselor's knowledge about cultures different than their own, right? So we can walk into those clinical encounters with that knowledge. And the third piece is skills, which in essence refers to the utilization of culturally appropriate interventions that resonate for clients. So one of the interesting things that I found in looking at this research is that multicultural competencies are largely or have largely been measured by counselor's own self-assessment, completing a survey tool that in which they assess their own level of multicultural competence. And the research that I discovered in that process of really digging into the literature indicated that oftentimes there is not a significant correlation between the counselor's self-assessment and the assessment provided by those counselor's clients. Umm… Perhaps more disturbingly in some ways, umm… Fuertes did a study in 2016 in which the finding was that counselors tended to rate their own multicultural competency higher than the clients rated their multicultural competencies. So if we let that sink in a minute, it should really, umm… hopefully cause us to take pause in the field because really in many ways what we're looking for is the perspective of the client and how culturally competent do they see us in a way which kind of steers us in this other direction of multicultural orientation being more process oriented multicultural competencies. Can you talk about that process orientation, that difference? 

00:11:40
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD I really appreciate what you highlighted regarding the multicultural competencies because, initially, in the training on cultural competence what we communicated and what we learned as students was that we wanted to have the skills that we needed to acquire the knowledge and the self-awareness piece. So it seemed as if these were things that you could possibly check off of a list. 

00:12:00
SIDNEY SHAW That's right. 

00:12:00
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Knowledge, I have it, skill set, I have it, self-awareness… Hmm, that gets kind of tricky because sometimes we have blind spots but what I really appreciate about the multicultural orientation perspective is because we are actually engaging in a process that is actually action oriented and that is very valuable. So when it comes to multicultural orientation in our counseling settings as you shared, it is not solely the counselor or the trainee saying, "This is what I know to be true. This is what I believe is what's going on." It is the client who actually shares their perception of how they're engaging and how they're responding to the counselor or the student trainee as a competent in a culturally sensitive professional. With that being case, it reminds me of the research by Sue et al. when they began to look at micro aggressions. And what we found initially was that micro aggressions was pretty much related to people making comments that were denigrating or put downs about another person that belonged to a certain group. However, Sue and his colleagues decided to take it a step further, and they began to look at micro aggressions and their relation to race and people of color. And sometimes in our counseling sessions, there are things that we say that we do, it can be an insult, it can be a put down that we unconsciously or are unaware is insulting to the other person. So multicultural orientation becomes incredibly valuable because when we introduce the topic into the counseling session what I believe we're communicating to the client is that this is a safe space. This is an opportunity for us to talk about culture whether that be ability, whether it be race and ethnicity, whether it be privilege that we are able to talk about these things in this safe space. I also appreciate the fact that it's process oriented because what we realize what happens in the counseling session is that it becomes a microcosm of society. And so with it being a microcosm of society whatever we bring from outside of the therapeutic doors and what the client brings, it all enters into the counseling session once we crossed that threshold. Now I don't know about you, Sidney, but I remember when I started in the field, I thought, "Oh, whatever those spots may be about a particular group of people that's okay because I can separate Stephanie's personal beliefs from who she is as a counselor or as a professional." However, that was not the case because when it came time for me to make a meaning of what the client was saying, the ability to conceptualize the client, those thoughts, my world view, the lens in which I saw the world actually entered into how I perceived, interpreted, diagnosed at times, and even understood the client's experience. I love the fact that multicultural orientation is process oriented because, guess what, counselors no longer have to be the expert. We don't have to be the all knowing the one of how everybody navigates their life. The client becomes the expert of his or her life. The client shares how the individual interprets their lived experiences and how they make meaning of those experiences. 

00:15:35
SIDNEY SHAW That's such a good point. I'm glad you brought up the piece about, umm… how challenging, or perhaps even impossible in many cases, it is to separate our own personal beliefs from our role as a counselor. You know, some of the researchers on this particular topic of multicultural orientation when they compared that to multicultural competencies, they said umm… multicultural competencies are a way of doing, multicultural orientation is a way of being. And I think that really captures the essence of it in some ways. In… in many ways, they inform one another, multicultural competencies inform our ability to exude this multicultural orientation in sessions. But you mentioned micro aggression, and this is a really interesting one for I think counselors and student counselors to self reflect on. There have been at least five studies on this particular topic, umm… and the findings have been very interesting. So what clients have said when surveyed about this is that in those five studies, the percentage of clients who experienced micro aggressions from their counselor range from 53 to 81%. So this should be a real umm… sign for us to take pause, reflect, and consider what kind of model, umm… or approach we can use in working with clients to help reduce that. Now Sue and colleagues have been very clear about this that it's not so easy is saying, "Don't commit micro aggressions." 

00:17:00
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:17:00
SIDNEY SHAW Right? Because they grow out of our own implicit biases. So, really, it's about trying to open up our awareness trying to approach sessions with a degree of cultural humility. And also potentially recognizing when we commit a micro aggression in session or some sort of umm… breach or rupture in the therapeutic alliance occurs and being able to make repair attempts because I know for myself and, you know, for counselors in general we're not perfect and we say things that we wish we could take back. And so part of this model is really that ongoing feedback process between the counselor and the client and being sensitive to those cues that perhaps a micro aggression occurred or some sort of rupture in the alliance and making repair attempts as a result. 

00:17:45
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. I love what you talked about in terms of repair attempts. Uh… Repair attempts or recovery skill and counseling is essential because, like you said, we made do our best to not commit a micro aggression or a micro assault but things will happen. Umm…. And I love that it's cultural humility. 

00:18:05
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah. 

00:18:05
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Because as counselors, we have to humble ourselves. And I think it's really important to be mindful of the opportunity that clients provide us to enter into their world. And it's a privilege to be able to do those things. So when I think of multicultural orientation, how to support counselors, and trainees, and clients, not only do we have the topic around recovery skills but also the peace on feedback and reflective practice. And so, Sidney, as we're talking, I'm curious what are your thoughts about reflective practice as well as the concept of dynamic sizing and counseling. 

00:18:50
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah, that's a good question, and something really important for counselors to think about this idea of culture as something that we can acquire knowledge about. I think this is where multicultural competencies and that knowledge sort of bumps up against its limits in a way and all constructs have limits. Umm… And we're multicultural orientation can provide some guidance. Dynamic sizing in essence is the counselor's sensitive ability to understand when to individualize, like, what's going on with this individual clients and when to generalize, right, because we develop through our training and studies the knowledge about norms that exist in particular cultures. And so we may make assumptions that norm applies to this individual client from that cultural background. You know, a story that umm… from my own counseling background that really emphasizes this in many ways is I worked for many years with native populations and, of course, there is the general norm that native people indigenous folks in North America tend to prefer to not make direct eye contact. And I had two clients come into my office who obviously knew about this, umm… this norm that it was out there in the world and this is what people believed. And they said, "You know that thing about native people not wanting to make direct eye contact?" They said, "I don't buy it." And their rationale was they felt that this was the result of colonization and being taught to be submissive in some way. And so here's a couple of people who may not adhere to that norm that I had learned in my counseling practice was closely adhered to by other native folks. And so I had to adjust. And so that adjustment process really is dynamic size and it's putting aside something I may have learned about someone from a particular cultural group because they feel it doesn't apply to them. And so that's kind of that process of dynamics sizing. 

00:20:45
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yeah, I really appreciate that example because once again that's the difference between the cultural competencies or multicultural competencies and multicultural orientation because you are correct. The training is this is the group and this is what we know to be true about the group and you did a great job highlighting an example of an outlier, that is not necessarily so. And thinking about your experience, it reminds me of the research on the Emic and Etic perspective because a counselor is not able to be culturally encapsulated or to operate from an Etic perspective where we group all people together and that's what your example provide that, anyone who has a native culture that they would not make direct eye contact because that's what we learned or that's what we thought to be true of all individuals. But we know that is not the case. What I love about the Emic perspective is because often I think about it, you know, Emic is E-M-I-C and in my mind the "E" becomes bold font to me because that means that we see me the individual, the client, and we are hearing about their experience and their perspective. Sidney, it actually reminds me of a time when I was providing counseling services. And I was a new professional, and I had a client who was an older African-American woman. So I identified as an African-American, so there some similarities in the cultural groups. However, what I learned quickly was that culturally our norms were not necessarily the same. So for her family, whenever they had to talk about difficult things or things that might be stressful, they all decided to sit on the floor, and they would form a circle, and they would process whatever the difficulty or the stress there was for the family. So in our counseling session, at the very beginning, she asked me, "Do you mind if we sit on the floor?" I didn't really know what to do with that because based upon the training and what in my mind it meant to be a professional counselor that meant that I would sit in the chair, like you're sitting in the chair, she would sit in this chair and we would engage in talk therapy. However, it was important for me to consider dynamics sizing, although I didn't know the term at the time, and the Emic perspective, and to make myself available to the clients, and to do what was best for the client. So, Sidney, we had many counseling sessions on the floor. In fact, most of those counseling sessions occurred on the floor but I learned so much from that experience. I also learned how to be sensitive to the needs of the client. I understood the importance of the inter-personal process between the two of us because I can almost guarantee if I would have said no to her, more than likely, there would have been a premature termination because I didn't understand her cultural norms and what was important to her. 

00:23:55
Introduction to Sidney and Client 

00:23:55
SIDNEY SHAW So, Stephanie, now we're going to watch a session of myself with a client. And part of what I'm going to be doing in this session is broaching the topic of culture. And so just to talk a little bit about the clip that we're going to see and set it up, this is not an ongoing client. This is a client that came in for the purposes of this video. But she's not acting, she's not role- playing, she's bringing in a real concern that's going on in her life. The client's name is Yomi, and she's a doctoral student, and she's experiencing some self-doubt in her program. She immigrated to the United States as a child from Cameroon. And so what we'll see is the beginning of the first session in which I'm making a statement, opening the door for her to talk about culture as it may relate to the problem that brings her in. And so one of the things that I wanted us to chat about just briefly before we watch the clip is, you know, kind of, the purposes of broaching the topic of culture initially in session, especially when they are evident, cultural differences between the counselor and client. 

00:25:05
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sure. I thank you for introducing umm… the video clip, and I look forward to talking about Yomi and your interactions in the counseling session. I'm curious because you shared with me that you began to talk about the issue of culture early in the session, in fact, you noted as a part of the confidentiality process. Can you share with me what is the importance of broaching the topic early in a counseling session? 

00:25:35
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah. Well, I think there's a couple of… I mean, it's a really good question. I think there's a couple of important reasons. Number one, uh… for me is to communicate that I'm going to do my own homework as a counselor. You know, it's my responsibility to be, you know, to go back to that multicultural competency of knowledge. 

00:25:50
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:25:55
SIDNEY SHAW So it's my responsibility to have some knowledge about her cultural background and how norms from her background may influence what's going on in her life. Number two is also to communicate to the client that there are limits to my knowledge and to acknowledge that, that despite my best efforts to be unaware, and conscious, and culturally competent counselor that we may pass my… my threshold at some point and I maybe in a domain of not being very aware knowledgeable. And the third piece is really to open the door as widely as possible for the client to feel comfortable giving me feedback about moments in which I maybe not understanding something from her personal perspective or from her cultural background. And the research on this is really interesting. Clients whose… who experience their counselor as broaching the topic within, taking that initiative view there their counselor as more credible, they have stronger alliances with their clients. So there some good research out there to support the idea that broaching the topic early in the counseling process is… is number one, the counselor's responsibility and that there are positive benefits of that. 

00:27:10
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sounds good, and I really appreciate what we've learned from the outcome research about broaching the topic. One of the things that I want to note is that you have acknowledged that there are some differences between you and Yomi and we'll see that in a bit. Umm… As I shared earlier that by me being a woman of color that I have been in many counseling sessions where my skin color, my cultural experiences we don't always know about until we begin the actual dialogue and the therapeutic process but based solely upon faith validity of skin color that there are cultural or at least racial and ethnic differences. However, Sidney, what I want to highlight is that broaching the topic of a multicultural orientation or broaching the topic of cultural diversity, is a better way to put that, that this is something we should do with all of our clients and that it's not something we do because there is a visible difference or we read something on intake assessment where we realize, "Oh, okay. Well, this person maybe of a different religion or have a different spiritual belief than I have." But that broaching the topic is important to everyone in every session for all clients. So, Sidney, let's take a few moments to look at the video with Yomi to see how you broached the topic of multicultural orientation and cultural humility. 

00:28:30
SIDNEY SHAW Sounds good. 

00:28:35
First Segment: Sidney and Yomi 

00:28:35
Informed Consent and Broaching Topic of Culture 

00:28:35
SIDNEY SHAW Hi, Yomi. 

00:28:40
YOMI Hello. 

00:28:40
SIDNEY SHAW Welcome. I'm glad that you're here. Uh… Before we get started, I just wanted to share a few comments about how I work as a… a counselor. I know you filled out some paperwork in the waiting room before you came in and you may have answered some questions about yourself, demographic questions about umm… gender, and race, and ethnicity, and things like that. And so I also want to just mention those at the beginning because I'm… I hold a belief that we are influenced by all these characteristics that we have, the experiences that we have and, kind of, who we are, and our cultural identities. And when I say culture or cultural identities, I'm referring to things like, umm… gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation things like that. And so I tried to stay educated and knowledgeable about cultural identities that are different than my own. But even with those efforts, umm… there are certainly gaps in my knowledge and awareness that I have. And the way that I grew up, I may have just these kind of blind spots or areas of knowledge. Umm… So I'll try to be aware of that and do my own self-study and reading. But I also… Before we get started in our session today I wanted to, umm… invite you to point out to me if at any point there are some element of one of your cultural identities that's important to you and I seem to be misunderstanding, or not quite getting, or if I say something that's insensitive or offensive in that regard, I really would like you to point out to me if that sounds okay. 

00:30:15
YOMI Okay. 

00:30:20
SIDNEY SHAW Does that sound all right? 

00:30:20
YOMI Yeah. 

00:30:20
SIDNEY SHAW Okay. So with that said, I'd really be glad to hear anything that's on your mind today. 

00:30:30
YOMI Umm… Lately, I've just been uh… thinking more about like where am I… where I am? It's just, umm… it's a question that keeps coming back to me and it's just not, umm… I have something to do with not figuring out what you want to do in life. It is like, you know, you want to do, I'm on track to be a pharmacy student but it just comes what are you gonna do when you graduate, what are you gonna, it is like… how… what are you gonna do it yourself, and it just it just keeps coming, just like trying to figure out the answers before you, for all the questions that you have for your future like try to figure out your life step by step. Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing enough. Sometimes I feel like I'm too doing too much, it's just being lost and… 

00:31:10
SIDNEY SHAW Okay, so kind of both ends of the spectrum there. I'm not doing that and I'm doing too much. Is that right? 

00:31:10
YOMI Yeah. 

00:31:15
SIDNEY SHAW And I if I understood you correctly, the first thing you said was this question of who I am. Is that right? 

00:31:20
YOMI Yeah. 

00:31:20
SIDNEY SHAW And part of what you're sharing now, part of that is like professional identity. 

00:31:25
YOMI Yeah, profession identity and my personal identity just bringing it together because I've always wanted to be a pharmacist since I was in high school. But now I'm just getting closer and closer to becoming a pharmacist and I'm just like then what, what is the next step, what are you going to do this. Are you going to work in this profession, are you're gonna work, umm… what's section are you going to work, is that what you want to do in life or is it just because you got that degree so you're going to end up working in one of these places. And it's just like where are you, what are you… It's just… It's a very hard question. You can get to a tight spot and it, kind of, paralyzes you because you don't know if you're just kind of following a road that has already been set up like you go to school, become a pharmacist, you work this job, or like you have to go out there and look for opportunities that don't exist yet. But then what are you chasing if that was the case right. 

00:32:15
SIDNEY SHAW Right. And you said something really powerful there. You said it kind of paralyzes you. 

00:32:15
YOMI Yeah. 

00:32:20
SIDNEY SHAW And before that you mentioned bringing it together. And I got the sense, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you were talking about like, umm… different identities, one of which is professional identity and how these integrate. 

00:32:35
In observing Dr. Shaw, what did you notice that demonstrated cultural comfort (e.g., verbal and/or nonverbal behavior)? What did you observe in Yomi, the client, the indicated comfort with Dr. Shaw broaching culture and diversity? 

00:32:35
Pause the video and/or discuss 

00:33:00
SIDNEY SHAW So, Stephanie, that was a clip of me broaching the topic with Yomi, kind of at the informed consent process at the beginning. What did you notice of how, umm… Yomi responded to me broaching the topic of… of culture? 

00:33:10
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. First I want to say, thank you for allowing me to view your video and to sit with you today to process the counseling session. One of the things that I noticed immediately, umm… from Yomi when you brought up the topic of culture, her eyebrow had a slight raise to it. And it was a non-verbal behavior that I noticed. She didn't umm… actually, verbally respond but I thought like, "Oh, that's interesting." Uh… And I don't know how she process that but when we listen to her, she does not necessarily begin with discussing her culture. She begins talking about being a pharmacy student, and developing her identity, and what's next down the road. "So I wanted to do this since high school, I'm in the program, I'm getting toward the end of the program, and now what's next? Where do I go from here?" So what this says to me is that for Yomi, the cultural piece that is most salient, it appears to be her professional identity, or the development of professional identity, and how is she gonna transition from graduate student to professional. Now it does not mean that being whatever she identifies as in terms of race, ethnicity, her umm… sex, gender, etcetera. It doesn't mean that these cultural identities are absent from what's taking place in the counseling session but that's not where she initially discusses. And I'm really glad that she actually responded that way and I'm going to tell you because it's been my experience where we are working with beginning counselors or with counselor trainees that when they broach the topic of multiculturalism, that initially they're looking for their client to respond related to some of the more obvious cultural variables such as race and ethnicity. So once again, this demonstrates the importance of us to make sure that we are open to what the client wants to share and not to push our own agenda. 

00:35:30
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah. That's such a good point. And, you know, it reminds me of a quick story. 

00:35:30
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Okay. 

00:35:35
SIDNEY SHAW If I could just share it… 

00:35:35
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD I'm ready for it. 

00:35:35
SIDNEY SHAW Uh… I had a student in one of my classes in graduate school. He was like umm… a male who identified as gay. And I think he was the only gay student in the class. And one day we were chatting about umm… LGBT… the LGBT concerns, and mental health, and that sort of thing. And he chimes up as a very witty and observant fellow. And he said, "Yeah, you know, this morning I woke up and I had a gay breakfast and then I got on my bike and took a gay bike ride to campus. And then I got on my books into some gay study." And his point was this was a way that he was identified and there is a danger of umm… viewing everything in his life by other people through that particular lens. And so what we're trying to do with multicultural orientation is to understand which are the most salient identities for this individual. You know, we may make assumptions and we'll talk a little bit about my assumptions that I made in this particular session umm… about what we see as the most salient identities for a person but really that engagement process is key to try to understand their perspective. 

00:36:40
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:36:45
SIDNEY SHAW And so with this particular client and broaching the topic, I basically broached the idea of culture, right? And I gave some examples, so she, you know, just to try to communicate and what I mean by culture. And her first statement was to nod and say okay. 

00:37:00
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:37:00
SIDNEY SHAW Yes. And so, you know, for me some things that came up for me if I were to rate my own cultural comfort and broaching this topic, I would say it was about a 7 out of 10. So fairly high, and some reasons for that, umm… for being higher would be that I've had many discussions with umm… previous clients, with colleagues such as yourself, with family members and friends about culture. So I've had a lot of time and experience discussion topics of culture. Umm… And some things that probably might bring it down a little bit is the first session. We're sort of feeling each other out, trying to determine where we both stand. I'm trying to get my sense of how she understands the word "culture." 

00:37:45
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:37:45
SIDNEY SHAW So there's that process in the beginning of broaching the topic and trying to sort out what words to use, how to do it with particular client. But broaching the topic, as we stated previously, is important in terms of the research literature, helping clients know that this is something we welcome, you talking about that topic is not off limits if they see it as relevant and salient part of what's bringing them into counseling. 

00:38:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sidney, as you were talking, umm… I begin to reflect on what I saw in the video and listening to what you're sharing in terms of the research and your own comfort with discussing culture and diversity in a counseling session. I'm curious, do you think there might be any benefits to asking a client to share the definition of culture? 

00:38:35
SIDNEY SHAW I think it's a great idea. You know, all of this, of course, depends on the individual, the client. You know, we make decisions in the session based on the interpersonal dynamics that are unfolding but I think with some clients that could, in fact, be quite useful to have it be really broad, right? So that they are able to fill in the blanks of how they see culture and how they see it in their lives 'cause it could include things that may not be obvious to us like gender identity, umm… socio-economic status, and some of these might not be so evident. 

00:39:10
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yeah, and… and I'm glad you mentioned the other ones because another thing that I thought about is for individuals who identify as white, they may not really think about being white as a culture. I think about Peggy McIntosh and her research. And to say to someone let's talk about culture, sometimes they may think, well, I really don't have any culture as opposed to if we asked a question related to, "Do you have any shared customs, or norms, or values that are important to you?" 

00:39:45
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah. Yeah. That's such an excellent point. 

00:39:50
Strategies for Broaching the Topic of Culture 

00:39:55
SIDNEY SHAW Number one is write out your broaching statement, right? So for student counselors or counselors, often were trained write out your informed consent process and rehearse it, right? And the same thing goes for the broaching statement. And that doesn't mean that you shouldn't modify and adapt it for each individual client. But you want to have a good idea of the key things that you want to mention. And number two is really to be concise with it. Don't make it a long discussion. 

00:40:20
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:40:25
SIDNEY SHAW Umm… But just open the topic, I think mine was… was less than two minutes, umm… and then rehearsed that broaching statement that you have written out. You know, write down your thoughts about how you would broach the topic and then practice it. 

00:40:35
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD I… I love that. And one of the things that I would add to that would be to create your own philosophy of practice, almost similar to how some organizations have a vision, mission, or a statement of dedication. One of the things that I have found to be helpful is my statement of who I am, my own personal manifesto, the way I'm committed to the client's well-being and that there are some cultural variables that I have such as, uh… my race, my religious beliefs that influence how I am. But I am not about promoting my own agenda but making sure that I'm supporting the client, and it gives permission to the client to challenge me if they need to challenge me and that's something that we can talk about a little bit further with the power differential. But really, once again, it is related to those years of practice that we've had in our graduate programs as professionals, conversations in airports around culture that allow us to have this level of comfort. And we hope that counselors and counselor trainees will be able to have that same level of comfort when they are discussing multicultural orientations with their clients. 

00:41:45
SIDNEY SHAW That's an excellent point. So as we'll… as we'll see, we're gonna watch another clip here in a moment, we'll see kind of how the session progresses. And one of the things, since we're talking about cultural comfort, is I really want to get a sense of how the client perceives me, right, in terms of cultural comfort, cultural humility. Am I engaging in what she would see as relevant cultural opportunities, right, around the presenting problem that she's talking about and how that might relate to one of the cultural identities that's important to her. 

00:42:20
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:42:20
SIDNEY SHAW So in this next segment, that's what we're gonna see is… is kind of, the middle of a session and the client is talking about self-doubt that comes up within her particularly around being a doctoral student. And what we're going to see is my attempt to engage in what I see as a cultural opportunity to understand how and if self doubt for her is linked in some way to a cultural identity that's important to her. 

00:42:50
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sounds good. I look forward to seeing it. 

00:42:50
SIDNEY SHAW Okay, let's take a look. 

00:42:55
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD All right. 

00:42:55
Second Segment: Sidney and Yomi 

00:42:55
Engaging in a Cultural Opportunity 

00:43:00
SIDNEY SHAW So, Yomi, you mentioned a lot about self-doubt that comes up in your… in your program and in training, you know, working towards this professional goal that you have. 

00:43:05
YOMI Yeah. 

00:43:10
SIDNEY SHAW And as you were talking it, I was wondering if there are ways, influences on that self-doubt related to be a person of color in your program. 

00:43:20
YOMI Always, you know, umm… I read a book from Chimamanda, the title of Americana and talking about how you don't notice that you're black until you come to, let's say, like a foreign country like America. And that is true because in Cameroon everybody, you know, different shades but everybody's mostly black. And so you don't call you so black, there's no box to check. I mean, you know the color of your skin but you don't really say, "Oh, I'm black." So when you come to America, you realize that even though you're from another place, they see your color first before you talk, before you say anything. So you are black. And when you are trying to do anything, you have to see a checkbox and you have to pick your race and you just kind of obliged to keep black because you're like okay, I guess I'm black. So it's something that I've had to adapt to. I didn't really grow up thinking, "Oh, I'm black and have these limitations." But moving to America at 15, I've had to learn that it's the whole history, we're not really well-informed. Umm… I just think education doesn't do a good job of telling people a lot about history but, you know, at some point you learn. And so in my class of 82 students, there are only two black students there, me and another student from Cameroon. And so and in the entire pharmacy program, I think that only like six black students and I think we were in New Mexico, so of course. But there is just, umm… there is this pressure because of the whole culture and just how the whole history of how umm… African-Americans in America just, you know, it's just something that happened as a fact. And it's no secret that, you know, on… on average the African-Americans the socioeconomic status is lower. And so there's just this stereotypes about what you're supposed to be. When I came in high school, you know, a lot of people would say, "Oh, you don't play basketball. Why don't you play basketball?" And I didn't know. I was like I don't play basketball, like, why is such a big deal. But eventually I learned that there is just the story, you know, play basketball because you're black. You look like an athlete. You know, just a lot of things that come in between what your expectations from, you know, because of the color of your skin. So this becoming a pharmacist is just like, you know, it's not a lot of story, there's no big story there. So what are you going to make of it and being like, you know, black American, umm… black woman in America becoming a pharmacist? There is that self that of like if you don't make it in America, you'll just be like, oh, you know, there's not a huge expectations from black people to do something great in America. It's not like a big, you know, different from, you know, in Cameroon where, you know, a lot of people expect you to do better because you've come to America. In America, the story is whole different because of the history, you know, they don't really expect, you know, a black, uh… a black person to, you know, come up with the groundbreaking research or do something that is, you know, mind blowing. Instead you make news if you do that, it's like, "Oh, this black person did something that was so cool." 

00:46:10
SIDNEY SHAW So you said a number of interesting things. One was it almost sounds as if you're describing the expectation is opposite. 

00:46:10
YOMI Yeah. 

00:46:15
SIDNEY SHAW Here the expectation is really low. 

00:46:15
YOMI Really low, yes. 

00:46:15
SIDNEY SHAW And where you come from the expectation is really high. The other things that you mentioned and I just want to check in and see how this might be if it is somehow wrapped up with challenges that emerge in your program are stuffed out that comes with up, you said before coming here, you don't really think of yourself as black. And you got here and you used the symbol that you had to take checkbox, right, in a way and that that is how, I believe, the word you use words when you're identified as black first. 

00:46:45
YOMI Yeah. 

00:46:45
SIDNEY SHAW And here that has a very different meaning. 

00:46:45
YOMI Yes. 

00:46:50
SIDNEY SHAW That's associated with lower expectations you said. 

00:46:50
YOMI Yeah. 

00:46:55
SIDNEY SHAW And also these stereotypes about what it means to be black in the United States. 

00:46:55
YOMI Yeah. 

00:47:00
SIDNEY SHAW How does this fit in or does it fit in or self-doubt? 

00:47:05
YOMI Yeah. Self-doubt. It's just kind of like if you don't, like, you just tell it like the self-doubt, it's like can I make it because you've come to a place where it is like it's not a priority for you to make it, if you don't like… It's almost like it's an excuse, like, if you don't make it, it's like, "Oh, you know, marginalization, and slavery, and…" You can send list of excuses for you not to make it, like, it's almost like no problem or you just fall into a where, you know, like you just fall into a gap. You're just like, "Oh, you couldn't. You tried. Oh, I'm so sorry. The pronoun was too hard for you. You know, you've come so far." I feel like people always make excuses, like I said, "Oh, I went forward in school and it was too hard." "Oh, I graduated from the business school but I couldn't do anything." "Oh, you know, you did too much." I feel like it will almost make excuses for me if I didn't make any. It's just a self-doubt like they are trying to people wrong, and you trying to become something almost to shut people up. You just be like… And should just be like and to lead the way, for like, if you get to some where higher, maybe you lead the way for young black girls, maybe black girls that come from Cameroon should be like "Oh, this person made it" because you don't really see any person of African descent making it to, like, high places or get into this big position, or becoming CEO, or like, the director manager of the pharmaceutical companies, and stuff like that. And so maybe if you get there, you show the people like, "Look, I made it." So it's almost that pressure and, you know, it just comes in between you're trying to do something that maybe has been done before, very few people would it, other people hope to do it. 

00:48:20
SIDNEY SHAW Right. 

00:48:25
YOMI And you just self-doubt just like what am I, like, you know it's just… it's almost just like it is… I don't know, you fall into yourself. You ask yourself these questions that, you know, what am I… what am I doing this for? And it's just so much that he could represent by the same time you could just be like, "Oh, am I good enough?" Like, you know, there's already so much out there, I'm a woman, and all those things. All of those things associated with weakness and failure and it's just, like, you have to get past that and you try to make a statement. 

00:48:55
SIDNEY SHAW So what I hear you saying is like, I think, other… other people out there continue make excuses for a person, for you. 

00:49:00
YOMI Yes. 

00:49:05
SIDNEY SHAW Let's just use that example because oh, you know, because you're marginalized for lack of success and this is somehow related to that low expectation that you described earlier. And at the same time, you've also indicated that it is… it is a factor that's different, right, when you come here and check a box and you're, you know, one of two black people in your program. And this is how a lot of people see first as a black person. 

00:49:35
YOMI Yeah. 

00:49:35
SIDNEY SHAW So it has relevance and there's also this outside narrative or message that sometimes sent of, oh, you didn't succeed because of marginalization in some way. 

00:49:50
YOMI Yeah, like, you know… 

00:49:50
SIDNEY SHAW And this fits in with, in some way, with self-doubt or at least concept of self-doubt. 

00:49:55
YOMI Yes. Yeah. You just see the whole question of who you are and when people don't see you and you are trying to take yourself to those places where people don't really see. You know, you have to make a space for yourself so that somebody else can be like, "Oh, I can…" 

00:50:10
SIDNEY SHAW Make a space for themselves. 

00:50:10
YOMI Yeah, it's just like, oh, Barack Obama being the first, you know, people call African-American president. So now someone else is thinking, "Oh, he did it, maybe I can also get there." You know, like, but nobody else had done it before him. So maybe if you are black in America, you don't probably think that you can become president because you're like "Oh, all presidents have just been white men." Like, you know, but, you know, Hillary ran for it and maybe next year maybe more women run, maybe a black American will run for president. You are just like you don't know, you're trying to push walls that you don't know if you can push, like, you're trying to… 

00:50:40
SIDNEY SHAW And this is kind of… And when you say that, you're referring partly to yourself. 

00:50:45
YOMI Yeah. 

00:50:45
SIDNEY SHAW You are trying to push wall that you don't know if you can. 

00:50:45
YOMI Yeah. Exactly. 

00:50:50
SIDNEY SHAW To achieve something that is difficult to achieve for anyone and there also it was an element of race involved that makes pushing that law. 

00:51:00
YOMI And you just don't know and you'd have seen a lot of people who don't expect you to push and one of this is expectation. Like in the American and West Cameroon, it is been different, who don't even expect you to be going there. So maybe they might not even like tell you the option because they just didn't see that you somebody that could do it, you know, you might not really… Yeah, so people might not even like offer you the benefit of the doubt and tell you about something because they don't regard you as somebody who can do something like that. So it's just… If people don't think that I can do it, people don't think that I can make it, can I make it? 

00:51:35
SIDNEY SHAW Right. So some of that is there's a danger of internalizing… 

00:51:40
YOMI Exactly. 

00:51:40
SIDNEY SHAW Okay. 

00:51:40
YOMI Yeah, like, if people don't see me doing this, why do I have so much confidence in myself, what if I'm just bluffing, what if I'm just all talk, what if I can't really do it, what I get there and I can't make, like, you know, people don't give you that credit. You just be like, "Oh, then why do I think I can do it?" 

00:51:55
SIDNEY SHAW Okay. So that… that questioning can become one's own question oneself. 

00:52:00
YOMI Yeah, exactly. 

00:52:05
SIDNEY SHAW If you're not careful, you have to be… 

00:52:05
YOMI Yes, you have to be very careful not to lead that… You have to know yourself a little bit, just like, who am I? And so you are just going back in the same circles and you just take turns, and until you figure it out, you just don't… Yeah. 

00:52:20
SIDNEY SHAW Thank you for sharing that, Yomi. It offers me some insight as a… as a white male, sometimes it's hard for me to understand perspectives of people who are different than me because I haven't lived in that world. You mentioned earlier in the session about being on crutches at some point and how that, sort of, gave you new awareness about… And that'd kind of how it is, right? We don't really know what it's like or I should speak for myself, I don't know what it's like to have a disability but if something like that happens, you can get a glimpse of that. 

00:52:45
YOMI If you had to be on crutches, you had to be in a wheelchair, you'd be like, "Oh, life is a little slow." You know, the doors are harder to open. I have to get up the stairs, my arms get sore, and you just start to see, oh, handicap those are really handy because, you know, you just push it and you can walk without opening the door. And so you start to appreciate things a little more when you're on the other side, so… 

00:53:10
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah, well said. So, Stephanie, my aim in that video or one of my aims in that segment that we just watch was to engage Yomi around what I saw as a cultural opportunity which was to inquire with her about how and if a cultural identity for her relates to this problem of self-doubt that she is discussing. And I chose to ask a specific question. I asked about being a person of color and how bad or if that relates to umm… the self-doubt that she experiences in her program. And her response was always, you know, and she proceeded to talk about that. What are your thoughts and reflections on that cultural opportunity I was trying to seize upon? 

00:53:50
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sure. First, I thank you for bringing up the topic again and providing her with the opportunity to share what her experiences have been both in the classroom and outside of the classroom. I would be just honest to say if, excuse me, I would be dishonest if I did not share that my heart felt a tug on it when Yomi's response was always and when she talks about coming to the United States of America and having to check a box to identify who she is based upon race. 

00:54:30
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah, that's powerful. 

00:54:30
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD That was very powerful. Another thing that stood out for me was her responses around cultural norms in the United States of America. As an African-American to hear a younger African-American woman express that there are low expectations for African-Americans in the United States of America, that was sad for me. And the fact that she is beginning to internalize that with self-doubt will I be able to complete the program, will I be able to be successful, will I be able to bring forth groundbreaking research because there has not been an African-American and or a Cameroonian who has done these things. So what I'm hearing is a woman who represents multiple identities, her identity of being a woman, her identity of being Cameroonian, her identity… her identity as someone who is categorized as African-American or black in the United States, and whether or not she can bring down the walls right. 

00:55:50
SIDNEY SHAW Right, that was a powerful metaphor that she provided there. 

00:55:55
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Mm-hmm. It really was. And so we listened to her and we watch her provide these metaphors. And although she is smiling and she is engaging, there are moments where she actually looks tense and the counseling session. 

00:56:10
SIDNEY SHAW Right. You know, it's a really good point. And as you're talking about this, I'm reminded of what we spoke about earlier with micro aggressions and micro invalidations in particular. And one of those that commonly gets expressed is this notion of colorblindness. 

00:56:25
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:56:25
SIDNEY SHAW Right? And you know, when I was first exposed to that concept, as an undergraduate, I thought what's wrong with that. 

00:56:30
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:56:35
SIDNEY SHAW We all are equal, right? I don't see color. But you don't have to dig very far beneath the surface to see that the problems with that and the quote that kind of changed my mind or shifted my thinking on this topic was from the civil rights activist Julian Bond. And his statement was something like, "To be blind to color has to be blind to the consequences of color." And we don't have to confine that to color of course, right, gender, sexual orientation. Umm… And so asking that question of Yomi, it's clear that had I not asked it, it may have been harder for her to bring up the topic of being a person of color in her program and it was clearly salient. 

00:57:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

00:57:20
SIDNEY SHAW Now that said, I don't want to stroke my own cultural opportunity seizing too much because there were certainly things in that clip that I would do differently. 

00:57:30
Pause the video, and ask yourself, what do you wish Dr. Shaw had done differently in this segment with Yomi? Why? 

00:57:30
Pause the video to journal and/or discuss 

00:57:40
SIDNEY SHAW For instance, she mentioned being a woman and that seemed like one that didn't that I didn't respond very much to. Umm… And so if I were to do some self-criticism of that clip, I would attend more to her identity as a female because that one seems salient for her as well. In some ways, it might be my own assumptions, which is a little painful for me to watch sometimes. Like most counselors, I do things that I self- evaluate, and think I did that well, do other things where I think I could have done that better. And in this sense I think I may have made some assumptions that this was the most salient identity for her. 

00:58:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Right. And that makes me think about the research of Beirut where she did studies on multiple identities. And even at the beginning of the counseling session in the mid section, we are broaching the topic but as solely, not exactly solely but primarily, around the topic of race or being a person of color. But when we have clients and even ourselves as counselors, if we represent multiple identities, we have to be mindful of all of those variables. And so you're right, there could have been the opportunity to talking about Yomi being a woman. However, this is when we get the opportunity to go back to what we talked about earlier today and that is the topic being able to use recovery skills to go back and to discuss an area in a counseling session that maybe we did not follow up on. And I love the use of immediacy counseling particularly when we're talking about the multicultural orientation because it's okay to take opportunities in the session to actually pause, to sit, and to reflect. So for instance, one of the micro insults that I noticed was when she came to the United States of America and there was the comment about her being black. And so she must play basketball. You are black, so you play basketball right. 

00:59:35
SIDNEY SHAW Right. 

00:59:40
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD For me, that would have been a good opportunity to actually say let's… let's just slow down for a moment here, let's pause, let's reflect. You are sharing with me what you've heard from other people about cultural norms, what you've heard from other people about the expectations that they have on you. So not only do we have Yomi bringing forth the expectations of her relatives, her family, and her friends in Cameroon but also the expectations of people who are in the United States of America. I also want to add another variable to the equation, I don't know how old Yomi is but looking at her on the video I'm wondering if she's a part of the millennial generation. So that's another cultural variable that could actually be discussed in the counseling session. 

01:00:25
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah, I think that's a… Your point about immediacy is a really important one. I think in that case, slowing the session instead of going high and fast, going low and slow as they sometimes say. I mean, that would be a great idea to sort of really pause and reflect upon what she's saying about that micro insult that she experienced and these expectations that were sort or not sort of that were completely surprising to her when she came to the United States. You know, one thing that happened there that sort of falls under the realm of immediacy was a… a process self disclosure on my part. Umm… Later in the session or in that clip, one of the things I said was something along the lines of as a white male it's sometimes different difficult for me to understand the perspectives of people who are different from me. And so that's a bit of a self-disclosure about my own identity and how that may create, umm… blind spots, and in a way it just was something that emerged inside of me was this awareness of potentially having blind spots related to what she's talking about as hard as I may try. And so what I would like to do for a moment is maybe to just have our viewers pause the video and to respond to a few questions that we have around this session clip. Does that sound okay? 

01:01:50
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Oh, that sounds perfect. Thank you. 

01:01:50
SIDNEY SHAW All right. Let's do that. 

01:01:55
Pause video 

01:01:55
Choose two that resonate the most for you. 

01:01:55
1. What emotional reactions did you have in watching this discussion of culture in the session? 

01:01:55
2. What emotions do you experience when you put yourself in the counselor's shoes in this segment? 

01:01:55
3. Are there areas of privilege for you that might limit your capacity to understand Yomi's cultural worldview/ experiences (e.g., gender, race, age, sexual orientation, etc.)? 

01:01:55
4. Identify reasons to mention cultural differences that exist between you and the client? 

01:02:35
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sidney, I was thinking about what you shared about your self-disclosure in the counseling session and earlier we talked about Macintoshes work around white privilege, I'm curious as a white male do you ever feel the need to discuss being white in the counseling session when you're working with people from diverse populations? 

01:03:00
SIDNEY SHAW Yes, and I did that in that situation, in fact. I mean, a part… a part of that was, you know, as I sit with clients and try to be as empathic as possible, I realize sometimes I bump up against my own umm… boundaries and part of that is often related to privilege that I experienced in my life as a white male. And so part of my reason for disclosing that is to share that with the client that I appreciate her sharing this with me, it has given me a glimpse into her world, and helping me in a sense to be culturally empathic. Umm… But despite her efforts to help me understand it and my efforts to want to understand it, there is kind of umm… a point there where it's a little challenging. So, you know, to express cultural humility and essence. And it's not as if I set out strategically to say I'm going to be culturally humble right now. 

01:03:50
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. Yes. 

01:03:55
SIDNEY SHAW It was more of a sense of something that emerged inside of me as a truth that I felt that I'm understanding this but I know because of my own identity that there is going to be a boundary to that. And some things that emerge within me as what I see is a truth in the session I'm share and some things I don't. And this one I thought it could be a way for me to acknowledge my privilege and to acknowledge my appreciation for her given me a glimpse into what's related to the self-doubt for her related to culture. 

01:04:30
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sidney, I want to thank you for bringing up the topic of your own identity and privilege in the counseling session. Once again, I think this is a wonderful opportunity for clients to be able to consider the role of culture as well as you sharing your truth. And having openness to the topic because in our counseling sessions we want to use some of those basic counseling skills where there's empathy as you discussed, where there is sensitivity and authenticity to the experience of the client. And I think that also assists with you establishing rapport with Yomi that she was able to see, "Okay, this gentleman does not understand everything but he wants to understand everything." And I think that's a wonderful opportunity for this client. 

01:05:20
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah, I thank you for sharing that. And that's why I'm trying to communicate is I'm sitting here and I'm trying. 

01:05:20
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:05:25
SIDNEY SHAW Right? And I know I don't have all the answers and, you know, the research is really quite favorable for counselors in this regard. And that is that clients are pretty darn forgiving… 

01:05:35
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:05:35
SIDNEY SHAW …when they experience us as being culturally humble. So for instance, micro aggressions that get committed in the session, lack of seizing upon cultural opportunities or what they call missed cultural opportunities, when clients view the counselor as high in cultural humility, they're fairly forgiving of those things. So as long as I think we can bring that into the session while trying to seize upon cultural opportunities, trying to be comfortable and talking about it, if they experience us as culturally humble, that goes a really long way. Something else you mentioned that really resonated for me is this idea of kind of a reflective practice. 

01:06:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:06:15
SIDNEY SHAW Right? So engaging in counseling with clients, trying to embody multicultural orientation, and reflecting, having self-reflection and intentional self reflection on how we're doing, questioning what we're doing. You know, one of the researchers on multicultural orientation says that, umm… culturally humble counselors don't assume their own competence. And so I think that's a key element of this. And so an important part of a reflective practice over is feedback from clients. And so that's what we're going to take a look at in this final segment is the end of the session where I'm trying to engage Yomi in a way, at the end of a session, where I can get her perspective on how the session went, things that I might try to do differently that would help me demonstrate more cultural competence or humility. So I'm asking for her feedback in this last clip. 

01:07:10
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Okay. 

01:07:15
SIDNEY SHAW So let's take a look. 

01:07:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes, I look forward to it. Thanks. 

01:07:20
Third Segment: Sidney and Yomi 

01:07:20
Feedback from Client 

01:07:20
SIDNEY SHAW Yomi, thank you for sharing this today. 

01:07:20
YOMI Thank you. 

01:07:25
SIDNEY SHAW It's been… umm… I feel honored to sit here and hear your story, and your journey, and how you are balancing the struggles that come up and just your perspective on it. Before we end today, I notice that we're almost out of time, before we wrap up I just want to check in with you about our session and specifically, umm… because we have a number of different cultural identities, I just wanted to check in and get your feedback about how well I seem to understand your culture identity and how it relates to what we were talking about today. And this may seem a little unusual but, in fact, I'd like you to rate me. 

01:08:00
YOMI Okay. 

01:08:05
SIDNEY SHAW Okay? From 0 to 10, where 0 is I didn't understand all the importance of this and how it relates and 10 being I understood very well. And let me say before you give me a rating on this that I really encourage umm… an honest appraisal. A negative feedback if you have it won't hurt my feelings. It's important for me to grow as a therapist and have that kind of feedback and to improve my ability to talk with you because I'm not perfect and sometimes I miss things or say things that umm… made the conversation off track or made can be offensive. So whatever feedback you have I completely welcome. 

01:08:45
YOMI I feel like you asked a lot of questions and that is good because then you allowed me the space to talk and in talking, I kind, revealed what I was feeling. So you didn't make any assumptions. You asked a lot of questions which is always very good because you did allow me to answer those questions. And I feel like by answering those questions, I… I told my own story because you asked me the questions that allowed me to. 

01:09:15
SIDNEY SHAW Okay. 

01:09:15
YOMI So I feel like that was very good. I didn't feel like you made any… you make any reference that was like, you know, suggesting something. All your questions seemed, out of like, oh, just so to be clear, you said this, this is what you mean. I didn't think any of your questions were fancy or, you know, were pointed to something I think that weren't making any assumptions. You were just trying to follow what I was saying and I feel like that allowed me to clarify myself and then fall in line. So I think you did like a 9. Of course, there's always room for improvement. So it's just, everybody in Dakota is different. Somebody from Cameroon may just be like, "Oh, I grew up in this" 'cause Cameroon has a lot of ethnic groups and religions. And anyone from a different religion may be of a different perspective. So it's just so important to just know that everybody's different, just because I think that that's how I interpreted it doesn't mean that the next person will. And so it's just good to know that but no, I think you did very well. 

01:10:10
SIDNEY SHAW Well, thank you for the feedback and if there's any point in the future where it seems like I'm not understanding things from your perspective umm… as a female, as a person of color, or anything like that, I really encourage you to let me know because I want to make sure that I am understanding. 

01:10:30
YOMI Yeah, no, we didn't touch more on the female part but that's another story from my culture, so that's… 

01:10:35
SIDNEY SHAW All right. 

01:10:35
YOMI Okay, thank you. 

01:10:40
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Well, Sidney, we had the opportunity to review the end of the counseling session. And I'm going to start with something we see right at the beginning. She laughs when you ask for feedback. What are your thoughts around that? 

01:10:55
SIDNEY SHAW Yeah, and she kind laughs multiple times throughout my… my, you know, asking for feedback. I guess my thought, you know, I take my own interpretations with a grain of salt. 

01:11:05
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:11:05
SIDNEY SHAW Umm… But that said, it's a little uncomfortable for her the thought of giving me feedback and specifically of rating me, you know, depending on how a person is educated they have all sorts of things that they attribute to those numbers which we rate people. But this is part of what I want to do in the first session with clients in general which is why I start at the informed consent process with the idea of her giving me feedback. And also why I make statements such as any feedback you have especially negative feedback is welcome. And I say it won't hurt my feelings because most folks have, umm… you know, certainly myself, you know, I grew up in the south and my mother used to say if you don't have something nice to say then don't say anything at all. So the idea of giving someone direct feedback that may seem negative is difficult and it violates some social norms. So for me I try to open that door to negative feedback as widely as possible. 

01:12:05
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:12:05
SIDNEY SHAW And so my sense, and I could be wrong, is that simply there's a little bit of discomfort there as I'm asking her to do that. 

01:12:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Sure. So we have variables such as discomfort, we have variables such as, uh… where you're from you gave that example, maybe yummy has a similar orientation that you don't want to give a lot of negative comments. You want to highlight more of the positive because the issue ultimately rates you a 9 out of 10 which is pretty well done. I want to know one of the things that comes to my mind is the power differential because we know there is a power differential in counseling. The counselor who although we share with our clients were open, we want to learn from their experience, but often clients still perceive the counselor as the expert in the room between the two of them. I'm also mindful of the power differential that you already have the title of doctor, Yomi is working toward the title of doctor although it's different disciplines but there's a certain academic rigor that she knows that you've gone through already. And so the need and the desire to respect that I think is a variable as well. One of the things she notes toward the end is that the topic of being a woman. And her country of origin, and their experiences, and their perceptions, she doesn't give us a lot of detail but that made me wonder. Hmm. I wonder how fit me being a man and Yomi being a woman influences how she rated him in the session. 

01:13:45
SIDNEY SHAW This is an excellent point. And as I watch the video, I mean, this is part of a reflective practice in a way. As I look back on that, I think it is a bit of a mistake for me to not address in the moment when she says we didn't touch on me being a female and she says but that's another story. And so if I had the opportunity have to redo that portion, I would check in with her briefly but given that I don't and if we were to have a follow up session that would be where I would start. I would… And this is, you know, on the practical level, this is one reason that it's important to have 5 or 10 minutes between clients. My own ritual around this is to sit down after a session and not write my case note but to write down my thoughts about my emotional reactions, how we ended the session, and my general impression. My hope would be that even without the video, that I would realize that this was an important issue that I didn't address. And I would want to start the next session by saying, "You know, I was thinking about our last session and I realize that you've mentioned being a female and that we didn't touch on that. And it seemed like something really important that I missed. Your thoughts about that?" Just to make sure we come back to that. And the research is really quite encouraging in this regard. There's been a lot of research on getting feedback from clients about the alliance at the end of this session. 

01:15:05
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:15:05
SIDNEY SHAW And it reduces dropouts by half according to the research that we have available and you can see why, right? If I'm taking the time at the end of a session to check in with a client about the alliance about cultural humility in the session and discussions of culture and opportunities that come up in that regard, it's an opportunity for us to sort out any misconceptions or any missteps that I had along the way before ending. 

01:15:30
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:15:30
SIDNEY SHAW Clients seem to appreciate that because the research shows they come back more frequently when we do. 

01:15:35
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD So we have outcome based research from counseling practices. I like what you said about taking the note as a part of your reflective practice so you can capture your own thoughts, your own feelings around what occurred in the counseling session. Although, we don't have the opportunity to have Yomi to be present with us, one of the things that I really appreciate is the recovery skills. So yes, you could have taken the opportunity to process the counseling session and her thoughts around being a woman but that didn't happen. And I think what I really… what I really want to stress to people who are viewing this video is that it's okay if you don't get it right the first time. 

01:16:15
SIDNEY SHAW Isn't that the truth? I mean, we're all evolving as counselors. I've been in this field for almost 20 years and, you know, this is part of the ongoing development process as we all have room to grow. And it's also part of being culturally humble in a sense. 

01:16:30
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:16:35
SIDNEY SHAW You know, if we think back to that research we mentioned earlier that counselors tend to rate their multicultural competencies higher than their clients do, this is really about getting on the same page as clients and encouraging them to provide feedback in such a way that we can evolve and grow as counselors broadly. But also with them as individual clients that we are learning how to dynamically size our work with them in a way that's resonant and that helps them get the benefit out of counseling that they deserve and that they want. 

01:17:05
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. Now before we conclude, I have a question for you. Let's say Yomi did not return to counseling and we will consider that a premature termination. What recommendations would you have for becoming counselors or even seasoned counselors? Would it be appropriate to call Yomi on the phone to have a check in like we would do with any other client that has a premature termination and it would it be valuable to share your thoughts, not so much dwelling into the topic of her being a woman but to share some general comments, hopefully to encourage her to come back if that's what she chooses to do. And how would one infuse a multicultural orientation and a reach out that may occur over the telephone? 

01:17:55
SIDNEY SHAW That's a great question. You know, my own perspective on that is simply that, umm… I would bring up the topic of female 'cause it seemed like that was one that was really important for her that I didn't address, and I would apologize, right? And so this may strike some counselors as something that while we don't want to do that 'cause we may admit that we've made a mistake. We make them all the time and if we realize it's one that was important for the client and that drove a wedge in the alliance in some ways, I want to take responsibility for that and indicate, at the same time, my commitment to growth in that regard and welcome the ongoing feedback from the client so that I could continue to grow. So, you know, and it's interesting the research is behind this as well that of those micro aggressions that are committed, we talked about that 53 to 81% of clients according to the available research experience that in sessions. And only 76% of the time counselors don't address it, either they don't know what happened or they think, "Oh, it did happen and I better just cover that up." However, from that research we know if counselors are able to take that step and address either a micro aggression that they may have committed or simply something that they overlooked that was really important to the client. 

01:19:15
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD Yes. 

01:19:15
SIDNEY SHAW When we can take that step, it improves retention, clients stay in counseling longer and it improves their outcomes as well. 

01:19:25
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD So some very basic skills that we can use to help with the interpersonal process, acknowledging where you may have offended the person, apologizing for the offence, and it goes back to the ability to use the recovery skills, and to release ourselves as counselors from feeling obligated to be the expert. Once again, we see it's okay to allow the client to take the lead in the counseling session while we're providing guidance and support. 

01:19:55
SIDNEY SHAW That's right. Well said. 

01:20:00
Final Thoughts 

01:20:00
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD I treasure opportunities such as this one to discuss case conceptualization, counseling experiences, culture and diversity, and clinical practice. Having a multicultural orientation allows counselors and trainees to discuss personal, social, and therapeutic variable in the counseling session. The result can be action-oriented for both the counselor and the client and an outside of the therapeutic setting. As followers noted, working with cultural identities and counseling is more than developing a skills. It is an identity and a way of life. 

01:20:40
SIDNEY SHAW As we become an increasingly diverse society, it's important that counselors engage in dialogue with clients about the cultural identities that are most relevant to the individual client. Multicultural orientation provides a model that in conjunction with MCCs training and experience can help counselors to connect with a wide range of clients and move past or at least minimize the impact of biases and our limited worldview. Competency in working with clients from different cultural backgrounds than yourself is not some end point that you arrive at. But instead it's an ongoing evolving process about the cultural backgrounds of clients who are different than ourselves, the history of culture is different than our own, and being open to question and challenge the limits of your own worldview. By taking these steps and using multicultural orientation as a model and as a guide in counseling practice, counselors can increase their ability to address mental health disparities and to connect with clients in a culturally humble way that will lead to more effective and culturally competent work. Being a culturally humble counselor, engaging with and seizing upon cultural opportunities in the session and expressing cultural comfort are methods we can use and models we can use to continually evolve as counseling professionals and as human beings. Dr. Ford, it's been a pleasure to work with you on this project and to talk about multicultural orientation with you. 

01:22:20
STEPHANIE J.W. FORD It's been a privilege, and I have enjoyed our time together.
