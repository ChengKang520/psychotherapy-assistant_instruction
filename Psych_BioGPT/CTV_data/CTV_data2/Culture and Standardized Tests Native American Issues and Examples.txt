00:00:00
  Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to another presentation from the Race 2004 Conference at Arizona State University. This morning's speaker is Carlon Ami from the University of New Mexico, who works in the area of education and assessment, specifically with educational psychology in the College of Engineering at the University of New Mexico. Carlon's tribal affiliation is Hopi Tiwa from northern Arizona. The majority of his work has focused on issues of research and evaluation, particularly in educational contexts and how the use of research and assessment procedures, protocols and processes have, in effect, ah, been used inappropriately with Native American and other ethnic minority children, uhm, thereby leading us to incorrect assumptions about students' educational gains and, ah, achievement in both the K through 12 system and in the university system. So, we welcome Carlon Ami to this presentation on factors contributing to the low performance on standardized test by Native American students as part of the Race 2004 Conference.

00:02:00
CARLON AMI  Thank you and good morning. That was a nice, hefty introduction. Ah, I wanna start the, ah, the little session of with a couple of quotes from a couple of authors. One of them says, "Standardized norm-referenced testing is no longer universally accepted as the one best method for determining learner success. Although some American Indian and, ah, Alaskan native students have shown academic success in this type of testing, the continued exclusive views of norm-referenced assessment could shortchange many, of American Indians and, ah, ah, Alaskan Native learners." And this is, ah, out of a 1995 study by Bordeaux. And another statement we have is, "If we wish to maximize student achievement in the U.S., we must pay far greater attention to the improvement of classroom assessment, very important. Both assessment of learning and assessment for learning are essential." Two different distinct things: Assessment of learning, what have they gained so far and then including, "learning." Okay? Or assessment for learning, what do they know now, how far do we want them to go and what should we do? How shall we take them up there? So that they really know what we want them to know, or what they need, their essential skills for their survival. And this is out of a night(ph), 2002, ah, study by Stiggins. Testing, as we call it, is a common practice in the educational system. K through 12, higher education, ah, no matter where we go, we like to test everybody we come across, everybody that comes through our classroom, we like to test them. It is a means of measurement; it is a means of measuring how much did they gain of what we presented them. We are the presenters to them, they are the receive, receivers. And we like to measure how much that, how much they got from that. Ah, unfortunately, the majority of these measurement that we do is summative, meaning, we want to know how much are they retaining up here, uhm, and not formative using that to determine what we need to do. Ah, so and so here has gained so much, somebody else here has gained so much, somebody else had gained more than the other two, okay? So we have a discrepancy. Why the discrepancy? Why did this one only gained this far, why did this one gained this much, why did this one gained way up here? That we want, that's formative, we want to fill those gaps up. The testing, as we know it today, as we see it in the eca, educational system is really the effects of political pressure. It's, ah, again unfortunate that the individuals, or the group of individuals who are making these decisions on when we should test, how we should test, ah, who we should test, what tools, what assessment tools we should use for these testing procedures are made by individuals who really have no feeling for what's going on down here, that interaction between me and you, between the teacher and the student, what's going on there, okay? The politicians, it's a political, it's a political thing, a lot of these decisions. Uhm, politicians as we know them, they wanna leave a track record, "I was responsible for this," "I was responsible for that," uhm, something to throw out there to gain electoral votes. Uhm, Bush's, ah, policy that's going on today of "No Child Left Behind Act." Uhm, but take a look at Texas and really see what's really going on there, what has really happened, okay? So, these are the kind of things that, ah, that we're tied to. The decisions are being made up here for everybody down below. Just some examples of some of the test that (inaudible ) standardize achievement test, ITBS, CTBS Stanford, the Terra Nova in New Mexico and AIMS in Arizona, aptitude tests such as the ACT, the SAT, required for admission to colleges and universities and the, ah, infamous, ah, IQ, intelligence tests. Uhm, some of the potential negative act, the aspects of this testing, number one is teaching to the test, and we'll look at some data that, that's gonna show us some of these things. Uhm, this is something that we see all too often. We don't and I, I, I tend to, contend to say that we do see a lot of teaching to the test, which is why there's really no learning going on. There's a lot of memorization going on. Native American students typically underper, perform other ethnic groups including Hispanics and Afri-Amer, African-Americans. Ah, this is a national phenomena and I think I want to qualify here that what I'm particularly talking about and interested in is the rural Native American student. Those students who live out on the reservations, away from the urban, uhm, the complexities of urban life and the conveniences of urban life. Ah, we have those students who fall in between, those students who are in rural areas but the, I mean, they're in urban areas but the city is close enough to their home, their homes so they do a lot of back and forth, ah, traveling and so they've got that complex issue. But what I wanna show you, focus on today is primarily the rural Native American students. 

00:08:25

00:08:25
CARLON AMI  In New Mexico we're, we're gonna look at some data, New Mexico high school competency exam. The high, high school competency exam is required for graduation, you, a student must pass that exam to be, receive a diploma from a New Mexico high school. If they complete all the requirements and fail to achieve the, ah, meeting the standards. They receive a letter certificate that says that they did, ah, co, complete all the requirements, however, they did, they fail to meet the standards. The diploma, they do not receive a diploma. Diploma is issued when they, ah, meet the minimum, ah, requirements and they take this at the 10th grade level the first time. If they pass it at the 10th grade level, they don't have to repeat it. If they fail, they have other opportunities. So, we have a trend from, ah, 1997 up to 2002. And one of the first things we might note on this thing here is that a big gap between 2000 and 2001, 94 to 83, 79-54, 80-55, 70-73. If we look back from here it's fairly consistent. Reason for that inconsistency here is just what I mentioned earlier. Teaching to the test, all of a sudden you change the top, the test form, okay? Something new pops up, and we have a discrepancy. Another thing you wanna look at is we wanna look at the scores. Anglos are pretty high up in here and 96 is in, ah, upper 80s, lower 80s, Blacks directly behind them, Hispanics and way at the bottom, the Native Americans, going all the way down to 46 and 43 with that change in test. 

00:10:20

00:10:20
CARLON AMI  New Mexico Achievement Assessment Program, ah, this is a state-wide exam, ah, pretty much equivalent to the Arizona AIMS, it's the Terra Nova, 2nd edition in the spring of 2002, these are median national percentiles for Reading in the 3rd, 5th and 8th grade. And this is state-wide. Anglos in the 3rd grade score are 65 percentile, 67 in the 5th grade and 67 in the 8th grade. This is above average. Blacks 48, 50, 49, right about average. Uhm, Hispanics a little below that, in the four, upper 40s. Get to the Native Americans, we take a plunge, 3rd grade 27 per, percentile, 5th grade 34, and 8th grade 35. A third of them have not achieved that minimum standard. Two-thirds of them are below. 

00:11:35
[sil.] 

00:11:35
CARLON AMI  Same ah, same Terra Nova in Mathematics 3rd, 5th, 8th grade. Again we have 60s up for the Anglos; the Blacks, 40s, below 40s; Hispanics, 40s; and down to the 30s again for the Native American. We jump over to Arizona, ah, Arizona Instrument to Measure Student Achievement, again looking at the perc, percent of 10th grade students at various competency levels, 2001-2002. We've got, ah, several layer, ah, levels here. B refers to below achievement, A says that they're approaching that minimum level, however, they have not achieved, ah, the minimum passing requirements. M says that they've met the, met the minimum requirements, E they exceeded. So together really, B and A, that group has not met the minimum standards. We look at reading and this is a high school in Arizona, which is predominantly Native American. Far below 29, they're approaching, but not quite meeting minimum standards of 47, 21 percent of them met the standards, only three of them exceeded. If we add those together, we get, ah, 76, three-fourths of the 10th graders failed to meet the minimum standards. We look at Arizona as a whole; we have 15-23 and are up(ph). Arizona as a whole, 38 percent fail to meet that; 38 compared to 76, we have a gap. Writing, similar 46, 45 plus 26 gives us, ah, 71 percent; did not meet the standards. And we look over here to, if they exceeded, none of them, not a single one exceeded. Arizona, uhm, 40 percent. Mathematics. Amazing. 87 plus 10, 97 percent of 10th graders, Native American students in this particular school did not meet the minimum standards. Only three percent barely met those standards, none of them exceeded. Take Arizona as a whole, 48 plus 19, 67 percent, still pretty low. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:35
CARLON AMI  Now, we'll take a look at the 3rd, 5th and 8th graders in that same academic year, 2001-2002. We'll look at reading, writing and mathematics and we have three categories here, below, those who had met and those who had exceeded, okay? So, ES is an elementary school in Arizona, which is again predominantly Native American. Third grade, 68 percent fell below; 5th grade, 73 percent; 8th grade, 69 percent. Third grade, 24 percent met; 23 percent met in the 5th grade; and in the 8th grade 40, 40 percent. Oops, 31 I'm looking, reading the wrong one, sorry about that, 24, 23 and 31 compared with Arizona. And then exceeded, very little eight, 11 altogether, 3rd through 5th, 3rd through 8th grade. In the writing, similar; below, very low, exceeded none, whatsoever compared to Arizona. Mathematics, look at the 8th grade, 100 percent of the 8th graders fail to meet the standards in Arizona, 97 percent of the 5th graders fail to meet the standards in Arizona, Native American students. 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:15
CARLON AMI  So, we ask ourselves then why we have such consistently low scores? So, what we wanna do then is we wanna examine some of the factors that are contributing to the phenomena. Now, it's important that you keep in mind that I'm talking about factors that are contributing, not causing these things. There's a difference between contributing and causing. One of the oldest, ah, theories with on-going debate is hemispheric brain dominance, left and right brain dominant. And if we wanna take a quick look at the screen, according to the experts, our left brain is going through and reading the words, however, it, our right brain conflicts comes in and, and wants to look, read the colors. And so, we have a conflict between the two sides of the brain, okay? Uhm, according to the experts then, the majority of the audience are just as brain-damaged as I am. You have that conflict; you have difficulty in reading that thing. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:40
CARLON AMI  Left brain, the left brain is, uhm, supposedly more logical, and schematic thinkers use the left brain, ah, scientists, engineers, these kind of people. They learn best through reading and oral commu-, communications. The right brain is the holistic thinker, the artists, the visual learners; they take things as a whole and look at the whole picture, rather than taking in little pieces and breaking them and looking at them, building themselves up. Stellar in the 1986, ah, study, determined that Native American students are predominantly right-brain learners. And this is supported by Rhoads, Robert Rhodes in a 1990 study, in which he states that both Hopi and Navahos are right-brain learners. Classrooms, as we know them today, are designed for what is called the left-brain learner. There's on-going debate, continuous debate. Chris Johns(ph), who is a Navaho in a 1986 study, ah, defunct the theory of the right-brain learner. And there's a lot of on-going bate, debate today as to whether Native Americans are truly right-brained or truly left-blained, left-brained and, 

00:19:10
[sil.] 

00:19:10
CARLON AMI  test-taking skills. Test-taking skills, uhm, are generally not taught in the classroom, typically because of the lack of time, the amount of material that, ah, has to be covered in the classroom situation. And especially in the rural setting when we're complicated with, ah, a host of other issues, ah, low reading, low mathematics, ah, low writing skills, all these things. Native Americans and in these rural schools typically lack these skills. As a result, gill, generally they won't ah, review before any test. Oops, sorry about that, let me back up and let me back up, hmm, one more, yeah. Ah, they tend to memorize, do a lot of memorization, rather than learning the concepts. There's a lot of peer, peer-pressure going on in the classroom. One guy gets up and goes, everybody begins to feel a little pressure, "I don't wanna be the last one in the classroom. I don't wanna be the last one to take the test ah, feel like a dummy." So, you rush through the test, randomly selecting answers, looking for patterns in there or just putting anything down, just to get out of there. One of the biggest problems is, asking and is this what you're asking. I taught Physics and Geology for 27 years at the college level, predominantly Native American students. Every time before a test, I ask, or I let them know, "Do you have any questions, whatsoever, anything? If you don't understand what I'm asking you here, ask me. Is this what you're asking? Am I not doing the right thing?" I never got a question, very rarely got a question. I grade the test, go over the exam, "Oh, I knew that. I knew that." "Well, why didn't you ask?" It's just not there. The results, poor performance. Examiner bias, something that educators don't like to hear about, teachers don't like to hear about, but it's there. Holbert(ph) in a 1990 study, indicated that 95 percent of Native American students surveyed in his, in his population felt that White teachers did not like Indian people. Wilson, in a 1992, ah, dissertation, uhm, said that some exam, examiners make biased decisions based on one, race/ethnicity; two, socio-economic status; and three, physical attractiveness. So, studies are there that show that there are, there, there is examiner bias. Perceptions of a test. How do individuals perceive the test? Values of Native Americans and the Anglo society are different. We value things that a typical Anglo individual does not value. We value our people, we value the welfare of our people, we value the welfare of everybody. Uhm, quite often, ah, materialistic things are of not as great of value as we see them in society. As a result of that, uhm, a test, the value of a test is questionable. "Why do I have to take this test? What's it for? What am I gonna get out of it?" The consequences of these tests are not fully understood because, for one, it's not fully understood, ah, stood at the home level, at the community level. Traditional teachings, they're different from classroom teachings. We are not tested, we are taught by our elders how to do things, why we do things. But no one ever comes back and tests us. "Did you learn that one? Did you learn this one?" Okay? And we are not penalized for not having learned something. And so, the students then are not fully aware of the purposes. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:00
CARLON AMI  Cultural bias, big issue. We just heard a big talk about that this morning. Garcia, yesterday, talked about being born into a culture that determines how we will function. It's not a choice. It's there, we are born into it. This is who we are, and how we function for the rest of our life then, is determined at that time. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:35
CARLON AMI  Native American styles of their teaching differ from the norm, completely different. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:45
CARLON AMI  Misunderstandings, ah, Tafoya and Wilson in '82. One of the things is the interpretation of test questions. We can read a test question, and a lot of us had, not a lot of times, but sometimes it means something different from what the maker has intended. And answers that we give are based on how we interpret the questions, not based on what the maker intended. As a result of that, uhm, we get it wrong. Prior knowl, knowledge is a big con, contributor. What do we know up here? What we know up here is based on what experiences we came through in our lives. And the experiences that we had throughout our lifetime are different from Mainstream America. We grew up out in the village, isolated from everybody else. Minimum conveniences, modern conveniences or none. The Navaho kid growing up on a reservation, in the middle of the reservation, no conveniences, no modern conveniences; have to chop wood, have to haul wood. We have a different experiences, we learn from our environment. Call, because of culture isolation. Some of the, some examples: I was in a class not too long ago, when the, ah, professor was giving an example of something and then asked, ah, "How many of you ever threw a pot?" I thought about that and my hand kinda went up, but then it came back down, and I was wondering why, why she wants to know how many of us threw a pot? I've thrown them off the mesa, you know, and I've seen others thrown them off in the mesa, and then throw 'em out the house and things like that. But why would she want to know how many of us threw a pot? Little did I know she was talking about making pottery, ceramic pottery, taking that dough, dough, and that's the, the clay and throwing it on the wheel, okay. Culture isolation. I didn't know that. When I hear the word, dance, I think about a buffalo dance, a butterfly dance, a Kachina dance, a Yaniwa(ph) dance. When my niece sitting down there on audience thinks about dance, she probably thinks about disco, going out there and boogieing, okay? Because she spend most of her life here in Phoenix. So, there's a difference in that concept. One of the questions that we may, that we have seen, particularly in the Biosciences is which of these item, which of these would you consider to be alive? And you have a list: A car, a house, a frog, a tree. Well, I would say all of them. But, of course, my answer would be wrong. But in my, from my perception, from my teachings, a vehicle is alive, a home is alive, a rock is alive, everything out there is alive. But the Anglo faculty member looking at that, the tree is alive, and the animal is alive. That's it. They're breathing. They define it differently from what we do. Rain, lightning, thunder, scientifically, they all go together. We get thunderstorms, but we also get rain without thunder. There are scientific explanations for why they happen. But in our way of life, they all go together. And they form differently; they come for a different reason than what the, uhm, astrophysicist, okay. Two different perceptions. Language barriers, very big. The transfer of the information from one language to another, ah, difficult, very difficult at times. So, our words in English that we'd have no words for in Hopi, Tewa, Navaho, whatever. Some tribes, they make new words for things like telephones, computers, ah, modern conveniences. Uhm, some tribes, like ours, they don't make new words for them. The way we talk about them is descriptive, we describe them or we throw in that, ah, that English word for them. When we're rattling along in our own language and say computer, or telephone, or cell phone, something like that and vice versa. Uhm, what this does on us is influence us reading and interpreting a test as a test maker intended. Ah, there are ah, individuals with varying degrees of language competency; there are some individuals who are fluent in both languages or three languages if there's three or four, but English and the other language, they're fluent in them. And then we have those who are semi-fluent in both, and those who are below fluency in both languages. And one of the results of this is we have a lot of code switching, you speak in one language and then throw in, bring in words from other languages, back and forth. And so, what happens here then is a test really becomes a measure of reading ability, your ability to take this test and pass it is really a measure of your reading ability. Many students are multi-lingual and that adds to their complexity. Some examples: Turn off the light. In Tewa, we say it one way, "Napapa(ph)," burn out the fire. If we want to say as to burn out the fire that's burning in the stove, we say exactly say the same thing. Turn off the electricity, "Napapa(ph)," turn the switch off. One phrase for the same thing. Get off the horse, same thing. In our language, "Oh(ph) huave(ph)," get down off of there. Heaviest(ph) guys on the roof, same phrase, get off of the roof. Sitting in a vehicle, same thing. But in Anglo society, it's different; get off of the roof, climb down from the horse, these kind of things. Negative and pal values, negative values, positive values, a distinction between them is not in our vocabulary. So, that complex makes it, gives mathematics complexity. We don't know how to say negative one, negative two, and negative three on down the line. We have no concept of that. Uhm, animals, things like, giraffes, elephants, some of these exotic animals, we don't have any words for them. Telephones, computers, mirrors, these kind of things, there's no words, descriptive type of things. And we're continually ah, bombarded with vocabulary words, improve your vocabulary, improve your vocabulary. And I for one resist that, I refuse to acknowledge that I must have a larger vocabulary to be able to function in a society, and I think this is typical of many Native American individuals. I don't need to the, know a word that long when I can say it in a different way. Another factor, socio-economic status, ah, no question of whatsoever between, about the correlation between the, a family's income and their academic achievement, of the students. It's there, there's numerous studies on the, there's a few that I have cited here. And it's consistent with all subject levels and grade levels and it's consistent not only with ethnic minorities but also with, ah, lower class white America. And wherever you go, it's consistent. Other factors: Motivation, how motivated our students to take this test. A lot of times the motivation is minimum, again, because there's no understanding of why they're taking the test. There's no understanding at home, there's no understanding in the community. Teacher expectations, it's there. Unfortunately, expectations are a first minute the impression, many times. A teacher is standing in the front of the classroom, students walking in, looking over the individuals, immediately identifying so and so as probably not going to make this test, make, make this class, probably not gonna achieve. And it's a label that's there before anything ever begins. And how much do we want them to learn? What do we expect out of 'em? Standards, we're talking about those all the time, minimum standards. Quality of instruction, how good is their teaching? Interests of the parents, home environment, what kind of environment are they living in? What's available to them? Stability within the school system, ah, stability, a lot of time is inconsistent. Families move around and one of the reasons why families move around is security of jobs. Uhm, go live with your aunt for a short while; go live with your brother, your sister for a while, uhm, let's go move again. Attendance, ah, fluctuates and one of the things that, ah, white middle class America doesn't understand is that we have, if we grew up traditionally in a traditional way at home, we have a commitment; it's in us. The people don't say come out and do it but it's something that's born within. It was determined at birth, and so we have an obligation to go out, so we take a day off and go out there. To us, it's a religious experience and we should be given that opportunity to make up whatever we missed. An uneasy feeling in a large group setting. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:15
CARLON AMI  There's a little bit of discussion. Life experiences in a, of the rural Native American child differ from standard American. And I think I've talked and gave a lot of ah, examples of that. The backgrounds of the family are quite different, their environmental settings of the home and, are different, way different. The traditional modes of teaching are different. The language structure, uhm, linguist tell us that we talk backwards, we'll turn around and say they talk backwards. Ah, it's a matter of, uhm, it's relative. Albert Einstein said it's, everything is relative, and it is. Maybe we're right, maybe our structure of language is right. And our value systems, they differ. Testing is, ah, is something foreign to many of us, to many re, rural Native American children, it's a foreign thing. No child left behind, I put slash, no learning left behind. I, I see this as an unfortunate move, what we're looking at is we're looking at testing and testing and testing, but we're failing to stop and ask ourselves a question, is there really any learning going on? Yeah, we might score high in a test, but did you really learn anything? One year from today, can I come back and ask you the, a question similar to that, not the same thing. Will you answer me correctly? I can probably hypothesize and say the majority will say, no, they won't be able to do that, because it's a memorization process just to get those scores up. Okay, I'd mentioned of the bottom of those rural Native American, rural Native American/Urban Native American and then the Urban Native American. So, some of the conclusions that I'd, that I wanna leave you with, uhm, is first of all, test-taking ah, abilities are influenced by the uniqueness of the Native American child. And here, I wanna use the word uniqueness. I don't wanna say different. Somebody else may say different but, the Native, the rural Native American child is unique; they have unique qualities because they grew up in a unique environment. Not the same as ah, growing up in Phoenix or Tempe. It's unique. Low test scores, are not a sign of lower intelligence. 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:15
CARLON AMI  And it's all a resu, a result of the norming of the instruments, of assessments; the norming is done on middle class White America. Maybe a little sample of, ah, Hispanic, with his sample of, ah, African-American, real small sample of Native American. Okay. And this is what it used to norm this, ah, standardized test, and so it's something completely different. It's not measuring, it's not doing us, ah, justice, it's not measuring us appropriately, it's not measuring our children appropriately. They are just as intelligent or maybe more, let's say more intelligent, maybe than a lot of White middle class America. We're just not doing it appropriately. We give, ah, give a Native American kid some duct tape, bailing wire and ah, inner tube, they can fix anything in the world. They can take a car and do anything with it; they can take something that was made, ah, in a factory somewhere with using high technology and change it around and make whatever. Take, they can take a coat hanger and make anything out of that thing. It's amazing. Ah, too often in the educational system, we are forced to mold ourselves around the existing system. The failure there is to take the system and build it around us. We don't do that; it's not done. Some of the leading factors that I've determined that contributed to low-test performance, number one is the language barrier, number two is prior knowledge based on cultural isolation. How were we brought up? How were we taught? And then our home environment. What do we have at home compared to everybody else? Socio-economic status. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:30
CARLON AMI  Okay, so, I guess in conclusion, what I want to say then, is that just reiterate what I said earlier that the rural Native American child or any Native American child is just as intelligent as anybody else. The way in which we where are measuring, the acti, academic achievements is inconsistent with our background, with the way that we would express our own intelligence, our own achievement. And I wanna thank you.
