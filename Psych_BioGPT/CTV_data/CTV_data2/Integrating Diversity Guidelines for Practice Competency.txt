ROBERTA L. NUTT  I'm Roberta Nutt and I am delighted to be here, which will become imminently clear when I explain. (laughing) I think I will, ah, introduce my cohort and kind of contact to what I was going to say. The reason I am delighted with this is because roughly, three years ago, I was elected President Elect Designate of Division 17. And amongst all the many wonderful things you get to do, as president is, uhm, develop some initiative of which you take some ownership that fits with the mission of the division in counseling psychology, of course, but, something where you wanna push the envelope a little further. And, and I, as I was thinking about that and, you know, appointing a million people to a million committees, which Linda Forrest knows well having just done it (laughs). Uhm, I harken back to, ah, CCPTP meeting, what should I push to put up that slide view?

ROBERTA L. NUTT  The, this one? I see, well, I would've done the wrong one. Don't let me touch it (laughs). CCPTP is the Council of Counseling Psychology Training Programs. And the training directors of all the doctor programs in counseling psychology belong and have programs and annual meetings. And several years ago, what, part of our program were presentations of the various diversity guidelines. We have presentations on the multicultural guidelines, the LGBT, the older adults, the women's guidelines and process, et cetera. And our original intent was to have them done in breakout groups. And the whole group said, " No, no, no, we all wanna hear everything because we all need to know. And after that discu, after that, those presentations, the discussion revolved around, okay, we have all these wonderful helpful guidelines that talk about different groups and things we need to know. But when we teach, we need to figure out how to integrate them. And when our students are seeing clients, people come in with multiple identities. And how do we all put this together? And that remained in my mind. So, when it was time for me to choose a project, that's what came back to me. And I consulted with Nadya Fouad, who was president of CCPTP at the time and we decided that should be a do, joint Division 17 CCPTP project. And then I sent out a call for people who were interested and I got these wonderful, thoughtful conceptualizations of what needed to happen. Because when I was asking this group to do, what we are asking them to do was to put together some kind of model or training guidelines or we, we didn't specify the format but for how to integrate teaching all these different diversity guidelines in some meaningful way. Not just in our graduate psychology departments, but also CE credits for the many people, including me, who certainly didn't have any of this training in our graduate programs. So, I got very thoughtful responses from several people, including the one sitting (laughs) behind me. So Marie Miville and Changming Duan, co-chaired this taskforce. Carole Pistole was one of the members. There are other members. These are the ones of us who were here at convention. There were also consultants involved to represented the different groups who'd written the different guidelines to, ah, help people stay on track and make things we were admitted. So, this presentation is really about where the task force has gone, what materials looked like now, I'm assuming future plans and I will turn it over to, who's next? Marie? (laughs) Take it away. And they've done such a good job. (laughs) 

00:04:00
MARIE MIVILLE  All right, I'm gonna, can you all hear me? Sort of? Okay. Thank you, Roberta, and good evening to everyone. I wanna first thank Roberta for her leadership in putting this topic of developing an integrative training model at the forefront of her Division 17 presidency. It is refreshing to see someone in the leadership world take on a topic and a task that is challenging with no easy solution as we've seen today, ah, yet, so important that it affects basically, all of us. I was honored when Roberta asked me and approached me to chair this special task troupe, group or as I'll call it, The STG on integrating the practice guidelines. This work represents, to me, a lifetime wish and dream ah, both personally and professionally. I still have memories of my graduate student days, where I would sit in one class and we would have powerful dialogs regarding racism and the importance of cultural practices. And then in another class, we would talk about sexism and the continuing violence against women. And I would always ask, but what if somebody say, a Puerto Riqueña named Martita, who's dealing with sexism in her workplace, is there a class that I can take or today, a class that I can teach that might better help me, help her. So, our work today represents what we hope to be the beginning of a roadmap for all of us as professional helpers to provide that kind of help to, to our clients. So, our first task in the STG was to identify those APA approved guidelines related to working with diverse populations. And these included the multicultural guidelines, the gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual guidelines, guidelines for older adults, women and girls, which is currently in process. And Roberta is actually one of the, ah, the founders of that. There was a previous set of guidelines for this uhm, as well. And actually, for men and boys, which is actually in, in the pro, process of being developed. Now, because practice guidelines must meet specific criteria, they all call for uhm, ah, respect for and sensitivity to individual and cultural diversity. In addition, the guidelines contain knowledge about a particular area and they inform psychologist and the public as a whole about pro, appropriate professional conduct for working with these individual populations. The guidelines all address safety and security issues that might arise from populations related to prejudice and discrimination. They provide links with other APA policies and identify specific stresses associated with being a member of that population. Most importantly, they articulate that need for complex understandings that give appropriate credence to societal and other systemic behaviors, policies and attitudes that may cause harm. Now, just to explain, we used the language that's incorporated in these guidelines. But we also recognize that, for example, the term, "sexual minority" is actually more inclusive term to represent the populations targeted in the LGB guidelines. So, we also realize that our task was not only to look at the guidelines but to think about a training model that might apply to populations that do not have their own set of guidelines yet. So, in short, we wanted to develop a training model that from the perspective that Oliva Espin so brilliantly described some time ago that diversity is the norm. We felt there was a strong need for the STG, professionally and practically. It's pretty obvious to all of us at, in this room that each set of guidelines contains a lot of information that's important. And that more broadly, the issue of individual and cultural ah, diversity and, that's the language that the Commission of Accreditation uses to accredit all doctoral programs in psychology, is foundational and cross-cutting. That is, this area of competence must be reflected in all aspects of professional service such that, all aspects of meaningful differences based on race, gender, sexual orientation, class, ah, ageism becomes present in all aspects of practice, case conceptualization, research, and supervision and so on. That is, it's time for us as a profession to walk the walk in terms of multicultural competence. So we established a number of questions that we thought were very important to our work as an STG. We wanted to know how the guidelines currently being incorporated into training programs and continuing-ed programs. What are key parallel issues that may be identified across these guidelines, for example, oppression and privilege? Also, what are specific issues about these guidelines that are essential to focus on? For example, racism is often a topic that today is still pushed off the table. How do we effectively deal with multiple and even conflicting oppression issues within the individual and even between groups? What are important processes and outcomes that need to be emphasized that facilitate learning of the breadth and depth of information represented in these guidelines? What key areas of training programs might be targeted for effective guidelines super, ah, integration, ethics, supervision? What are unique issues needed to be addressed for mental health professionals already in practice? It's pretty apparent that their training needs and interest would be quite different from suddy, somebody just starting out. We also wanted to finally look at best practices currently in effect and ones that we could come up with ourselves. In short, we, we didn't, we knew it was important to talk about diversity as the norm but we also knew we wanted to provide a model to training pro, programs and continuing-ed programs that would provide that road map. It wasn't enough for ju, for us just to say diversity is the norm. We wanted to provide some kind of model. So we, we identified several important processes. We wanted to articulate a theory in philosophy of integration for training, define objectives and desired outcomes, identify teaching strategies and methods and develop assessment poo, ah, tools. So in answer to one of our first questions, what is it that programs are doing now to teach the guidelines? We did a couple of things. We conducted an extensive literature review, which we're not gonna go into here. And then we also conducted ah, a survey of academic training programs. So we developed this, this survey, a really quick one and we sent it to all training directors. And we had about 60 percent of, of training directors respond to us. They reported that almost all faculty do about at least, the multicultural and the LGB guidelines. And that in fact, these two sets of guidelines are being taught in almost all of the programs today. A lot, the courses that is involved in, are the ethics and professional issues classes, practicum and supervision and it's even being tested on in the ah, competence exam, the comprehensive exams. However, when we asked about the integration of information contained in the guidelines, for example, "Do you teach about race and gender? And if so, how?" We had a lot more moderate feedback. We had about a four in a scale of five of "Yes, we think it's important." But we actually had a almost a third who said, ah, who are neutral or didn't even think it was a positive thing at all. And even some of the comments were really interesting. One person said, "We've never formally discussed the issues relative to integration of the guidelines but we feel being inclusive when talking about the diversity as valued." And they, they emphasized for example, primarily, multicultural and LGB guidelines because he/she felt the rationales that people who fall into these two categories experienced high levels of social oppression and that these issues are very much emotionally charged in our society today. Thus, teaching the guidelines leads to areas, is challenging and can have effective promoting competencies in multicultural areas. Another training director even put it more strongly, "I strongly believe in the integration. There are a lot of common principles and prospectives across the guidelines. And, this person actually ah, felt that in, integrated approach also helps us to be aware of groups or individuals who might be marginalized or silent, silenced, that don't have their own set of guidelines. Now, two main barriers were perceived by the training directors to an integrative approach, one, there, they felt there was uneven support and the other one they felt there is actually uneven levels of competence for doing so. So with that information, we set forth to develop our own theory and our own philosophy for an integrative training model. And as I noted earlier, we felt it important to be competency based, at least, for the professionals in training. We thought it important to emphasize broad and general versus narrow and specific. We thought both aspects were very important. And we also thought it was important to emphasize both the minimum levels of competence that is the "do no harm" part of it and the, the ultimate aspirational or as I like to call it, the "change the world attitude" about our training. And we also felt that an integrative training approach must begin with the trainee themselves with, ah, a focus on the multicultural self in all their levels of dimensions. Now regarding competence, there's a couple of, of important terms. And one is professional competence, where an individual's over all capacity, uhm, or demonstrated ability to perform as a professional psychologist. So it's the overall gestalt of, "Are you a competent psychologist?" And this is made up of much smaller pieces called competencies or elements of competence. They are observable, measurable, containable, practical, derived by experts and flexible. Now, regarding the broad and general area, we think that there's a, an, clearly an overriding issues of oppression. Ah, and as we've heard today at, at the summit, and in many previous summits, uhm, these, these areas of oppression all have, uhm, psychological consequences that can include anxiety, depression, anger, self-esteem and identity issues. Being a target of socio-political oppression means being minimized, shamed, devalued, marginalized by others, most importantly, others who are either powerful or intimate or both. Oppression that occurs in the context of accepted public policy further heightens these experiences because targeted individuals may feel they have no one to turn to. And as all the guidelines say, the effects of oppression affect, not only the practitioners, I mean not only the clients but also us as practitioners. Part of understanding experiences of oppression refers to competence regarding knowledge of socio, ah, historical context. For example, in the case of people of color, knowing previo, ah, knowing such issues as removal of American Indians from tribal lands, kidnapping, slavery and Jim Crow laws for African Americans and continued hostilities targeting immigrants of primarily, Latin American or Asian-American backgrounds. Similarly, understanding the current lack of public recognition regarding healthy relationships of LGB people further deepens our knowledge as to the challenges and stresses of maintaining such relationships. For example, presumed problems with intimacy may actually mask, ah, a reaction to overtly hostile circumstances. Another critical and broad general area relates to competence of specific cultural practices, worldviews, values and norms that exist for each client. And this entails being able to understand the multiple groups that each client and ourselves belong to and that the values from each of these groups may actually converge or conflict. Think back to Martika, imagine how different that experience of sexism might be if it, if it arose from a predominantly white work place or from member of her own family. Other broad and general competencies include, understanding how prejudice and bias are developed, maintained and promoted in oneself in larger society. Moreover, qualities of openness and self-awareness will help psychologists in understanding the impact of both oppression and different cultural practices on their clients and on themselves as well. In other words, undoing years, even generations of prejudice is not sufficient to providing multi-culturally competent services. We also need to develop positive social attitudes in that absence. Is it enough that you don't have biases? We think we also need to think about other kinds of attitudes to develop. And further, professional psychologist need to become adept at navigating multiple value structures of oneself, the profession and others. Particularly peers, students and clients. In other words, multi-cultural competence involves becoming aware of oneself and others, and knowing ways to, to negotiate potential conflicts among values that might arise from these varying sets of values. Now, in addition to identifying broad and general domains that cut across guidelines, we also think that there's important information that's uniquely contained in each set of ge, guidelines. For example, specific demographics, for example related to people of color, older adults, but more importantly, the unique impact of forces such as racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, ageism. Each of these describes struggles that have their own unique emotional balance. Indeed, ah, it's the balancing of the broad and the general with the specific and the narrow that represents one of the most challenging aspects of an integrated training approach. In other words, how can we talk about oppression in general without minimizing the specific experiences of racism or sexism in particular? And now, Changming is gonna talk about our training model that we've developed. Thank you.

CHANGMING DUAN  Good evening. Uhm, ah, based on what we learned from a literature research, uhm, from, okay, I'll try to be louder. Ah, based on our, ah, research based on the survey, Marie just, ah, described and on a member of members of, ah, CCPTP, that is Council for Counseling Psychology Training Programs. And based on their feedback, we developed to this, ah, model, this training model. Ah, Bobby Kaiser, who is in the audience, is responsible for putting this, in this, in lice, nice looking color, ah, coordinated format. Uhm, I want, just, ah, briefly, ah, say something before we move to a next slide, is the, we, kind of conceptualized this training going through four levels. The first level is the "Understanding the Multicultural Self," and the second is, "Understanding the Culturally Different Others," and the third level is, uhm, "Considering Specific Guidelines," and the top is the "Strategies." Uhm, I'm not sure if you can see very clearly. Now, ah, learning and practicing all existing guidelines, we believe that it should start with a solid, self-understanding. Uhm, understand our self as a multicultural self. This is not only important but it's also necessary towards the competency in doing this integration. In our multicultural society, everyone is multiculture. In the sense that he or she is either in the majority group or in the minority group, either in the oppressing group or in the oppressed group. And it contribute, we all contributes to the multicultural dynamics of the so, society. In other words, we contribute to each other's cultural experiences. So, consider that we think that it's important we start with our self-understanding. Uhm, the, first of all, the goal of that ah, level one, "Understanding the Self," ah, includes the first wise, becoming aware of our own privileges, prejudices and the role we play in oppressed, in oppression to others. Uhm, no matter who we are, in terms of our identities, social, culture, racial or sexual orientation or physical, in socio-economic status, we do contribute it to other people's experiences. We hold prejudices, enjoy privileges and play various roles, which is in many ways is ah, is, is pretty obvious. You either stand on this side or enjoy the others on the bank at the other side. So it is a critical, that we understand this at a personal and emotional level. It's not only cognitively recognized in what you do, really recognize in a personal, emotional level. And the second goal is to understand ourselves as a cultural beings(ph) in our own cultural context. This means that's ah, what, we understand that we have been shaped by the culture we live in. And this culture is dynamic due to the multicultural nature of our society. In other words, how we see the world and how we behave are not always the norms for everybody and therefore cannot be used as a standards to judge other people. Therefore, we should not be uhm, we, we should be very careful in terms of knowing the boundaries of our own culture, how we, we, our experience has been shaped by our, own personal experiences. Now, third goal is to prepare and position ourselves for respecting, appreciating and accepting others, who are different from us. Now, we all know that, we all know the psychological power of ah, feeling understood, feeling accepted or feeling appreciated. Therefore, as mental health providers, we should do whatever we can to be ready for this most important offering, for everyone we serve who are different from us. Now, this preparation is only possible on the basis of a solid understanding of ourselves. We, we kind of identify a number of a critical questions, first, to consider in learning, understanding our multicultural self. This includes, one, "Am I, ah, oppressor?" In some ways, we are all oppressors at, at times. One, "Am I a victim? How aware am I about my role in such oppression experienced by others? Am I a racist? What are my racial biases? Am I a heterosexist? Am I a sexist? Do I have privileges as a white, heterosexual, young and or able person?" In some ways, these questions, ah, sound very critical, which is intended. Because we believe that the journey towards a self-understanding needs to be deeper than question of service, surface or just being politically correct and that we may need some soul-searching and reach for truly heart-felt definition of our own baggages. Now, second level, uhm, from the previous uhm, slides you saw. The second level, uhm, is "Understanding the Culturally Different." And there's some goals, that, the first is understanding the common themes among guidelines, that Marie, ah, ah, talked about broad and general issues. So, the, this, first one is around the social oppression of privileges. Ah, she talked about this. Now, American culture is, is little debated. American culture is oppressive to those who do not fit in the dominant, uhm, group, the groups, ah, in terms of their skin color, cultural values, the sexual orientations, the gender, uhm, socio-economic status, age, sex, or age. So it's oppressive but on the other, the other side of the coin is those who do fit in. The dominant group norms enjoy certain privileges. This need to be recognized. The second common, ah, another common theme is the discrimination. Uhm, there are always a victims and the beneficiaries. We all know discrimination has been a kind, inti, intimate, a part of American culture. But it's, you know, we all know it's unjust, ah, unfair to many, but it still exists. Why? Because they are clearly beneficiaries of the discrimination practices. Uhm, so that's important for us to understand, when we try to integrate these guidelines, working with those people. And also, uhm, there's the worldview and the value issues. Now, differences existing in how people approach the world and the non-dominant groups of views and values, often get valued, get devalued or misunderstood or misjudged. Although everyone can claim that sometimes you feel your worldview, your values are not shared but in general, in this, ah, society considering the culture dynamics, usually is, undergo represented groups, their norms and cultural values get to devalue them more often. And also cultural practice, is, is, we all practice our own culture in some ways. And again, the fact is, the less understood the cultural practice is, especially those from marginalized ah, groups often gets viewed as abnormal or pathological. Now, example would be the, ah, LGBT populations. Their practices, ah, their sexual orientation was deemed as pathological up until the mid-70s. So that's, ah, example. Now, we also developed some, uhm, critical questions for us to consider, in this ah, second level of exploration and learning. Now, one is, ah, what are the common experiences by the various cultural minorities? Here are folks that should be on the common experiences of those who are genuinely oppressed. Now, second question is, ah, how does our dominant culture deals with the differences held but, held by non-dominant groups? We need to see the, the unique, the unjust, unfair and unreasonable treatment, minority people often receive is obvious. Is that they often receive experiences that we can say, they're different but oftentimes, there has the unjust, the unfair, unreasonable tone to it. Now, what are the negative consequences of the isms on the intended or even unintended victims? We need to see the psychological damage or the mistreatment does to the oppressed individuals and groups, so that we can stop blaming the victim. On the level three, uhm, we had ah, uhm, identify, so we need to consider each specific guidelines. 'Coz there's reason that, it, there's different set, different guidelines for each different populations. Now, we need to recognize that although all the oppressed individuals and groups share some common experiences, each and every minority group experiences unique disadvantages and denigrating treatment. While individuals are mistreated for different reasons, there may be different psychological results. For example, the, personally, you know, any mistreatment I receive, it hurts. But when I'm mistreated for being a Chinese, hurts more than I'm, you know, perceived mistreatment because I'm a woman or because, uhm, older adult. I'm getting there. Uhm, so it's, it, that really, really, there's a different psychological, uhm, effects of, of those experiences. Therefore, I found myself more sensitive to people I serve, people we teach, people we serve to their issues. One is, around the culture identity and less sensitive and less in tuned to their issues related to age or with gender, as such. So having different ah co, guidelines and make a point of having different guidelines is really necessary for us to be able to see the different aspect. The element of the whole person, help us eventually to reach a solid understanding of a whole person. The other, ah, the issue with this is, ah, sometimes in your, some aspects of our indent, identity may be more salient at a one time and less salient another time. So it's a situation specific as well. Now, these are the existing guidelines and there, uhm, I hope the, the, more the other groups deserves the guidelines that will be, uhm, ah, developed in the future. But Marie talked about those. Ah, each has a specific, uhm, aspects. Uhm, we should know that we all possess, we, I say everyone probably misses that we all possess one or more different identities across all of these dimensions at different times. The salience of each could differ, depends on the situation. Now, customers and trainees ah, should attend to the specific experience of each individual in addition to the coming experiences. So that's what this guideline is for, to educate us about, ah, specifics of this particular group. Now, next level is ah, strategies. Now, strategies, uhm, I put as a general, is a very general here because a strategy is, is about, uhm, we need to find the ha, what, what are the ways, what are the, the specific or general strategy we could use to help us to integrate guidelines, help us to understand the individuals across all the dimensions, ah, addressed by different guidelines? Uhm, as I had mentioned, ah, I was more attuned to sudden needs but not the others is because I wasn't familiar. I wasn't fluent in all the guidelines. Now, after the starting, doing this project, I felt it had entered to, ah, entered my consciousness. So that's the number one general strategy(ph). We need to allow this to enter our consciousness. Now, evolving in ourselves in organizational and a, in institutional interventions that may also be very important. Uhm, and so we all know the discrimination practices, it hurts. But oftentimes, people experience, when it happened in organizational level, institutional level, it may hurts more. You may have a more severe consequence for those individuals involved there, than other individual level. So that's why we need, uhm, the, the best strategies to integrate, to practice all of them. So, social justice is very important to for us to, uhm, become advocated for. And the, another point is ah, in terms of general strategies, is that many people will say, "Well, the guidelines are nice. But, you know, I, I feel there's certain aspect of me is not addressed by this." So we need to be able to, uhm, adopt a broader view. Expand a view to include class, income, even if there's no specific guideline yet but include this to help us to understand the individual as a whole. Uhm, now, ah, another issue is that strategies that often need to be situation and person specific. Now, this model encourages the trainees and practitioners develop strategies to communicate their gain and their learning from the first as, three levels. In fact, strategies can only be as effective as our learning of the first ah, three levels. In other words, the foundation is really, ah, very important. Otherwise, no strategy could work and no strategy could work for everyone. Oftentimes, the process of learning and developing competence involves going back and forth from between, uhm, back and forth between and among the levels to be more and more complete in finishing a task of each level. And ah, from the model, from the earliest slides you can see we have these, ah, two-way arrows, ah, between levels is that the, the learning process, it will, would involve some going back and forth between, among the levels. Now, here are some, uhm, specific guidelines, of, ah, specific strategies offered by some CCPTP members while we had a discussion at the one of the media, ah, conferences. There, the one is, ah, there's a specific one working with, ah, the culturally different, either it's a student or client. Uhm, so I, I jumped to your slides. It's, ah, the first, why it's a validating all experiences. And we, we're talking about the one students because the people have different identities. The, again, even this morning, the keynote speaker addressed the last year's, uhm, ah, last, ah, summit. There are some discussion about, you know, people's attending to different identity to, of individuals. The same people, ah, the rule of thumbs is the one, you walk with the people, you need to validate all experiences whether or not it's related to one or another of their identity. Now, facing, experiencing productive conflicts, the conflicts are not always bad. And this morning, there was address about, uhm, a conflict, ah, ah, resolution as well. Is that try to turn the conflicts as, resolving the conflicts, that's a process as, ah, constructive to psychological healing or teaching or learning. Now, therapist are becoming allies, ah, advocates, ah, thus, very important is that we become the social justice act advocate. Now, "Listen first and share later," I thought that was very helpful. After I heard that, I practiced in my class. It's very helpful, is that when people, everyone has ah, something to share, we all experience a different unjust experiences or, uhm, oppression and try to keep it in mind that encourages students to learn to listen first and share later so that you do not minimize other people's experience. And the holding the pain, ah, holding yours and others simul, to have them simultaneously. So, as a psychologist, we do have the capacity to do that. Ah, we should at least. So I guess we missed the one, one slide. But I want to mention though, uhm, that slide is not here. But our intention of developing this model is really to encourage everyone to see the journey and to start a journey towards multicultural competence in integrating all the guide, guidelines in malpractice in teaching. The model is itself is meant to serve as a broad framework for various individual efforts. Moving back and forth between, among the levels or, or shaping each level according to personal situation is normal and expected. Individualized approach towards each and all the levels is strongly encouraged. Another important ah, intention of ours is to promote competency based on learning. Ongoing assessment of learning is part of the ongoing process of ITM, this model. Training programs or service providing agencies are encouraged to develop a specific, ah, benchmarks and assessments towards, that fit the trainees and practitioners' developmental levels. The progression of this journey is not evaluated by which level one is at only. But by the depth of learning and the competence achieved at each step. Overall, the depth and the width of the competence will improve as the journey progresses. And therefore, assessment of competency will be more in-depth and comprehensive. So now, Marie is gonna talk about some limitations and challenges. 

00:38:40
MARIE MIVILLE Thank you. How're you all doin'? Thanks for your, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:38:45
MARIE MIVILLE your kind attention. Okay, I'm, I am gonna just talk a little bit about some of the, ah, challenges, ah, of an, ah, integrative training approach. And as I stated earlier, greatest concern in what Changming just talked a little bit about is how do you use this integrative approach without minimizing the specific experiences, say, of racism or homophobia? And one really classic example, say, in a classroom dialogue, somebody is sharing very personal, painful story related to a racist event that meant something deeply to this individual. And someone else pipes up and says, "Oh, that reminds me of, ah, an event related to sexism." And in a way, that may seem helpful and maybe there is some parallel experiences. But in that moment, that actually ends up feeling very minimizing of the person telling that story. So as Changming said earlier, one of the most important ground rules to set forth in an integrative approach is to ask students, ask trainees to kinda hold on to your pain while you're listening to somebody else's story. And in essence, that's a very important skill to have as a mental health professional. 

00:40:00
MARIE MIVILLE You can't always be jumping in with your own personal issues. And a related issue is, uhm, in teaching an integrative approach is to allow for the expression of different meanings about a same topic. Let's take the issue of violence against women. So imagine what that topic feels like for a man to talk about and a woman. So issues such as fear of victimization, different levels of status within a larger society and even your own family and the issue of gender privilege affects how men and women might deal with, even be able to talk about, the issue of violence against women. Similarly, experiences of different types of oppression or struggles will vary according to the different impact of your socio-political group. For example, issues of intersecting group memberships as race and gender dealing with the dual issues of sexism and racism or, or racism and, and ageism will differ for men and women. Presumably, because each of these group memberships have different levels of oppression and privilege. And then the last challenge that I'll just mention is how is it that mental health professionals can deal, can develop competence for people that don't have their own set of guidelines already. And so, we believe that an integrative approach actually helps people develop a sensitivity for individuals who might be feeling separated, excluded, invisible in some way in the larger society. So I'm a way a little bit of our time, I just wanna talk about two seconds of some pedagogical considerations. And that one of the things is in any kind of professional service, teaching, research, to always think about cultural issues even if that person seems to be similar to you, so, that also can be an issue. We also encourage the incorporation of developmental approaches because that helps people to understand where they are in that moment of time, as well as their peers. And we also believe a case approach facilitates people just coming to understand how these, all these very large and, and, uhm, complex issues exist within a single individual. We feel that's a really effective approach. And then, finally, in terms of assessment, we think, of course, it's important to do it and that it's important to focus on the individual self, to start with the trainee, not the client, and to emphasize attitudes. And we also, we, as I said earlier, ah, not just, ah, negative attitudes of prejudice and bias but also developing accepting attitudes. And what does that look like with each professional? Self-reflective, ah, journals that are not necessarily about an A or B but about the process of coming to understand and articulate what oppression and culture means to you, we think, is an extremely effective approach. And, finally, multiple measures, the 360 degree ah, ah, approach to assessment where you talk to the, the trainee, you talk to their peers, all of their teachers, their clients, to get a sense of how people are, are doing in all their aspects of professional training. And so, now, Carole is going to talk about how do, how do we, ah, implement our integrative approach with current professionals. Thank you.

M. CAROLE PISTOLE  Hi. Ah, before I get started on this, I want to mention that, ah, some of what I'm going to present is also the work of Charlie Waller. Ah, he and I worked on this section together. Ah, I hit the down key, I'm sorry. Do I hit the down key? 

00:43:45
MARIE MIVILLE You hit the, the home key. 

00:43:45
M. CAROLE PISTOLE Got it. Okay. Ah, current professionals in, ah, refers to direct service providers but it also refers to others such as educators. The importance of applying the model to professionals is that our effectiveness in, in our, in our jobs and fulfilling our responsibility is contingent upon our knowledge and integration of the multiple diversity competencies. And it's enhanced, our effectiveness is enhanced when we're able to develop or some of us update, or some of us maintain those competencies. Ah, we figured we have professionals in jobs, at work who are at level one or level two who need to work on learning about self as a cultural being and need to be prepared to appreciate experiences of cultural and social oppression and to respect the other worldviews, values and, and practices. Some self-initiated in informal learning strategies consists of gaining experience in multicultural environment. Ah, embededness in one's own culture is something that, at least in my opinion, we start with, at least. And in exp, having experienced being and living, working in a multicultural environment can help reduce that embededness. I'm not saying it necessarily will but for many people it does help reduce it and then increase culturally relevant learning. So there are several ways, ah, these are just examples of ways to seek diverse environmental learning experiences. One is to find the diverse spiritual home, uhm, whatever that is for the individual. Ah, second is to work on professional committees that are composed of people who represent these diversity dimensions, who are different than the self, who have, ah, values and views different than the self. Another way is to supervise a junior colleague while that junior colleague, colleague benefits from the, ah, more advanced professional's knowledge. The more advanced professional can learn about a col, ah, the junior colleague can learn about diver, I said that wrong. The junior colleague gains knowledge. The senior colleague, who is supervising a junior colleague who is in some, on some dimension different than the self, can get to know that junior colleague and know more about that diversity dimension within that person. Another informal way, of course, to, ah, reduce one's embededness in one's on, own culture is to travel to different countries that have different values and different practices and, uhm, enjoy. (laughs) More formal learning strategies, continuing education is an important formal learning strategy for professionals. Ah, it can address the rapid turnover in our knowledge base. Uh, I think that my students who, say, are graduating now will find that their knowledge based on multiculturalism maybe out of date in ten years, five years. We have a very rapid turnover in the knowledge base. Ah, continuing education is important to improve practice and effectiveness. In fact, it's used by all professions and hopefully welcomed by psychologist who have integrated the value of lifelong education that, as university faculty, we certainly try to infuse into our students. I'm not sure those are the correct words but, the integrative training model evokes direct practical applications. So it's relevant, it's suitable, and it can, in fact, be pleasing to ongoing professionals and practitioners. It's easily infused with the substantial knowledge base that is built from practice experiences. In terms of challenges to continuing education, ah, when kind of challenge is a practical challenge, who and how well continuing education be delivered and then the personal challenge, which is resistance to self examination that's required for level one learning. One idea is for university-based educators to extend their skills of training pre-professionals to continuing education and training professionals. Ah, this is beneficial, I need my water, I'm sorry, about every five minutes. Benefits of, ah, university educators extending their skills include building that educator practice community bridge, the educators gaining some real world, practice insights, which then enhance teaching effectiveness, can enhance research effectiveness for those of us at those kinds of universities. And can facilitate the educator practitioner collaborations, which can be very creative and inventive, and, go places that are sometimes hard to determine. There, ah, are three models, continuing education models. One is the update model, which is a kind of didactic information, content tier, essentially what must the professional know. Ah, this could address both the broad and general, and the narrow and specific domains. Ah, second, ah, and actually I'm not sure these are rank ordered in terms of the way continuing education might want to deliver them. Different people might fit with different levels. The competence model combines knowledge with skills, so, so it's like a skills tier. What must the professional do in a broader sense and, ah, how can the professional infuse the model throughout one's practice, whatever one's practice is. I think of teaching it for instance, as a practice as well. The third, the practical, ah, model, ah, the performance model is, what is a professional all about? And this is particularly useful for the integrative training model. Ah, people can self-examine at this level, involve their ex, examples from their professional work setting, which makes it relevant to the self. And learning outcomes can accrue from reflecting on the multicultural self, the self is ah, composed of these multiple identities. And that includes ah, becoming more aware in one's personal life, as well as, in one's professional life. Uhm, these, ah, this level can be delivered through small group experiences ah, and link learning to increase practical effectiveness. You can link learning to increase career satisfaction as ways to perhaps interest people and help them gain more through it. You know one thought we ah, Charlie and I had this so it would be very useful for psychology licensing boards to require training in multiculturalism as continuing education. Ah, another practical challenge is what's gonna be the timing? What is gonna be the format? And professionals, of course, are busy. A crisis model, it needs to be, can be useful, it needs to be convenient, it needs to be relevant to the professional, needs to be individualized for each professional people need to be able to take something individually from it. Self- assessing, doing independent learning and have systematic learning as well. One way to do that or it could be separate is a comprehensive web-based program, which really requires an interdisciplinary set of professionals to set up, ah, where you can have, you know, the information, you can have the self-assessment on it, et cetera. Wherein both a crisis model like, and a web- based program ah, you can use multiple teaching modalities, which can, which also using the multiple teaching modalities also compliments the complex awareness and knowledge and skills that are needed for multiculturalism. Ah, personal barriers, how to help people overcome resistance to self-examination and ah, complete the intellectual, and actually start the intellectual and technical skills learning. We thought that varied teaching modes would be very useful in this respect. Reading, having people read, having role-play ah, journaling, discussion, case review, film also can be useful. Ah, helping people focus on practical procedural knowledge, practice scenario, share case study, share stories, metaphors ah, use the literature, read biographies, for instance. And again small heterogeneous groups can be useful to help people process their learning. Help them process the intense emotional ex, re, emotional reactions, their intense emotional experience and to help them explore and overcome resistance. So, to summarize, keep learning relevant to the practitioners' domain, for me, that would be to teaching students and helping students learn. Ah, dialogue and self-reflection can lead to action. Ah, integrate new examples into existing no, ah, knowledge and skill repertoires. Include the psychologist experience, their life experience and their practice experience is both background and foundation for learning or even for updating. And, ah, draw attention to the practice guidelines and the model's multiple layers of awareness and knowledge and skills. And again, focus on being more effective as a professional and being more satisfied in one's career. And I think I'm done. Okay, Roberta is gonna. (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
ROBERTA NUTT  We gotta quick discussant here, (laughing) very quick discussant. I had a few points to make, one, you may now understand why I am so pleased that the progress this task group has made, when you have kind of a fuzzy idea of something you'd like to see happen and see a group of people take off with it. It's really gratifying and I'm very proud and pleased. (Laughs) Uhm, I would say there are future plans for those who want to pursue it. Ah, the group is planning many things ah, we're done out, finished, or we're not finished. Ah, one is a submission to the counseling psychologist for major article, which will make a lot of this more available to folks. And from these ah, points to make various kinds of training materials that would be available for people to use. We wanna make this something that can be shared and you'll notice we're being videotaped by uhm, Allen Ivey's company so that, it should be available. Uhm, one thing I noticed uhm, in the whole presentation, a couple of things I wanna comment on. One, were some series of questions to use for awareness. And the questions were, Am I a racist? Am I a sexist? Am I a heterosexist? And years ago ah, a feminist who visited our campus said, “That's the wrong question. The question is how am I a racist? How am I a sexist? How am I a homophobic? How do I discriminate against people with disabilities?" Because you can't grow up in this culture, as Changming said, we grow up in an oppressed, oppressive culture. You can't grow up in this culture without being somewhat sexist, racist, et cetera. You can't do it. If you ask people about a, are you a, are you? It's a yes-no and it's defensive. The question really is, “How are you?" And, in that might be something we ah, we bring in. An old feminist used to talk about it, it's like fish who are in water. They don't notice the water 'coz it's all around them. We don't notice the discrimination sometimes because it's all around us. Uhm, the large hole I see when I look at the guidelines that we've been working on is, we really aren't doing much with disability issues. Uhm, and I've noticed that many times in the multicultural conference uhm, and ah, when we were working under women's guidelines, we were so grateful to the disability committee and be BEAPI(ph) who gave us wonderful feedback on how to be inclusive with that in the women's guidelines. I think our largest need is with the CE for the current professionals. Because I, I still see a lot people who were educated 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 years ago who say, “What I learned is still relevant and it applies to everyone." They really aren't even aware. Ah, and that's a problem, how to get them in. Carole's point about licensing boards paying attention is a good one. And I'm happy to announce because Melba Vasquez has just finished her term as president of the Texas Psychological Association. One of the things TPA has proposed to the Texas Board is that there'd be mandated CE credits and multicultural education, not just ones in ethics or if they could be either one and I think that would be very helpful for many jurisdictions to adopt. 

00:57:10
ROBERTA NUTT  Uhm, I wanna make a shameless plug for the guidelines for psychological practice for girls and women, which have been now, almost seven years in the making. Getting through the APA process to get something as an APA document is daunting. Going through various boards and committees multiple times, membership changing, new feedback, I don't recommend it but it's really important. We actually got through the board of, and, and went out for public comments this fall. We've actually made it to the Board of Director's endorsement on their consent agenda in December. It will go to Council of Representatives in February. If you have any friends who are counselor reps, please talk with them (laughs). Because then, we'll have official copies, you know, for people to use in training and it will become APA policy. And hopefully, the men's guidelines will benefit from the women's guidelines. I do have some working responsibility there and we're sharing broadly, because a lot of the issues overlap.
