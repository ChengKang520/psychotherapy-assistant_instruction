TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY This is one of the series of training films on learning and teaching therapy. It is unique perhaps and that the clients are not shown nor are they heard. This is for reasons of confidentiality and the protection of privacy. What is presided is the planning and carrying out of therapy by a supervisor and a training group. It shows a supervisor at work and the trainees expanding their ideas and skills hopefully. The goal is to change therapist as well as to change clients since they must learn on how to change people in distress. The films offer valuable material for discussions since ideas differ about how to do therapy and how to train. The therapy being taught is brief and problem-focused and the trainees have not been taught the particular approach. The supervision is live with the trainees watching from behind a one-way mirror and taking turns going in to do therapy. Suggestions from the supervisor to the therapist are sent to a computer monitor in the therapy room. The therapist can see the messages said on the monitor but the clients cannot. 

00:01:50
HOW MANY CLIENTS ARE IN ONE BODY? 

00:01:55
JAY HALEY A case was brought for consultation because the trainee-therapist was having difficulty with it. The trainee was a beginner, and Sara, a Brazilian woman in her 40s, was an experienced patient. She was diagnosed as a borderline personality and a multiple personality. She was living in a shelter on disability and was medicated with lithium and Prozac. Sara showed all the symptoms of multiple personality. She was abused as a child. She reported eight persons inside her including a violent man, a playful child, and a person who likes to write named Mary. She claimed to be sensitive hearing and seeing things before they happened. She also lost time. The supervisory decisions were around deciding if she was a multiple personality or a medium in the African spirits religions so popular in Brazil. Followers may have identical behavior. These include being possessed by other selves. A supervisory question is whether to focus upon spirit possession, on multiple personality or on neither. Dealing with the case in terms of a structure and practical matters rather than religion. The training group considered these problems bizarre, even though spirit possession is the most popular belief system worldwide. In Brazil it is called Macumba. First of all is this your first interview with her? 

00:03:25
No, it would be my third. 

00:03:25
JAY HALEY The third! Okay, what’s her problem? 

00:03:30
She's ah… She’s a 41-year-old woman from Brazil. She's Brazilian. And she has been living here for… in the States for quite a while. Ah… She has been diagnosed as bipolar disorder. 

00:03:50
PLANNING THE FIRST INTERVIEW 

00:03:55
She's had… I cannot say an abusive childhood, I’d have to say she was tortured as a child. 

00:04:05
JAY HALEY Tortured? 

00:04:05
Practically, yes, and she was often in danger for her own life. Her father would drag them behind the trucks and drag them in the fields and… 

00:04:15
JAY HALEY Her father did that? 

00:04:15
Yeah. 

00:04:15
JAY HALEY So, it was the father abusing her then? 

00:04:20
Yeah! And ah… 

00:04:20
JAY HALEY And what’s… 

00:04:25
Raping her, raping her sister is killing, I mean, (inaudible ) a bad… a bad-bad situation. 

00:04:31
JAY HALEY What happened to her father? 

00:04:35
He had left the family a long time ago. Nothing ever happened to the father. 

00:04:40
JAY HALEY Does she have any connection with him now? 

00:04:45
No! Ah… No, but she does with her mother - she’s quite isolated. She has had two husbands. The last one was… I mean, they were living a kind of life, I mean very, it seems like he was ah… wanted by the police and he was… They lived in hiding for about four years in the States. And she really liked this life - it was exciting. But ah… now he’s in… he’s in Mexico and she’s here. They have been separated since January. She has ah… She's on medication. And she talks about different persons that she has in her. Ah… She has a child that she really cares for. She has… She's… She was abused and she’s abusive. She can be very violent according to her that she gets even scared that how violent she can become. 

00:05:55
JAY HALEY Against whom? 

00:05:55
Against her husband, against people who would not let her help. I mean, she’s afraid of her own strength and her own violence. Ah… She has another person. It seems like when she gets really upset and violent, she seems to block out and it’s as if she doesn’t really realize what’s going on. It’s not her anymore, she knows what’s happening. 

00:06:25
JAY HALEY Does she have any children? 

00:06:25
No! She does not. 

00:06:25
JAY HALEY So, just the two husbands? 

00:06:30
Yes. 

00:06:30
JAY HALEY Where’s her mother? 

00:06:30
She is in Brazil. 

00:06:35
JAY HALEY Does she have any connection with her? 

00:06:35
I don’t think she does. I'm not sure she does. Sometimes… She likes writing. She writes a lot and she always gives me what she writes. She writes beautifully. Ah… But she just goes on tangents sometimes. And… She does not necessarily follow the thought all the way through. But she’s… she would like to learn how to live with herself. This is what she really wants to do. 

00:07:10
JAY HALEY She doesn’t have a choice, does she? 

00:07:15
But she wants to be at peace with herself, that kind of… Last time she was talking about, I mean, she… she has a lot of resentments towards her father, of course, and she was… she knew that it wasn’t her fault what happened to her but still. I mean, she was saying, maybe I shouldn’t have done something different or maybe I provoked him or somehow, even though the whole family was in the same situation(ph). 

00:07:45
JAY HALEY She doesn't have a contact with him now? 

00:07:45
No! 

00:07:45
JAY HALEY I mean, she doesn't hear from him, he doesn't hear from her? Well, who is involved personally in her life? 

00:07:55
Now, her husband. They talk on the phone. 

00:08:00
JAY HALEY And he's where? 

00:08:00
In Mexico. 

00:08:05
JAY HALEY And she's here? 

00:08:05
Hmm… 

00:08:05
JAY HALEY And why are they separated? 

00:08:10
Because she was… she says that she was kind of tired of being in hiding of this very dangerous life. Now she's in a safe heaven. 

00:08:20
JAY HALEY But take me back to… What's… What is the dangerous life? 

00:08:25
The dangerous life is that his… he's… he's… he's wanted by, I forgot whether it's the FBI or the CIA, because he was part of the… the other team or… 

00:08:35
JAY HALEY The other team? 

00:08:35
I… I don’t know. I mean, I don't know (inaudible ). Well ah… 

00:08:41
JAY HALEY Well, you've had three sessions now, what… what have you started with her? 

00:08:45
I'm just starting to what she comes with, it seems. 

00:08:50
JAY HALEY She's what? 

00:08:55
I mean, she comes in with a problem then we talk about that. Last time she was being harassed by somebody. Ah… The time before she was talking about her husband, and the life with her husband. At the first time it was just a very general one. So, I'm still… I still wanted to know how to… where to give, where to… where to go, how… I mean, how to follow her, because sometimes I am not sure, or do I have to… to lead and she follows? I am not sure. 

00:09:25
JAY HALEY You have to have a goal. 

00:09:30
Create A Goal 

00:09:30
I want her to, I guess what I would like to get is for her to understand that she has a lot of… I mean, she's a strong person who has been through a lot and that… She has a lot of strength. 

00:09:45
(Inaudible ) those parts. 

00:09:50
JAY HALEY Tell us a little more about who is inside of her. 

00:09:50
She talked about the child, she talked about a man. Oh, I forgot to… to mention that she's sure that there is a man inside her and that she changes features and that the other people saw her as a man, lying in the bed. 

00:10:15
JAY HALEY Lying in the bed? 

00:10:15
Oh yes, instead of her. She was lying in her bed and somebody walked in and saw a man there. 

00:10:25
JAY HALEY Who… Who was that somebody? 

00:10:25
But she said… Eh? 

00:10:25
JAY HALEY Who was that somebody? 

00:10:25
Ah… Her husband… A friend of hers who saw him. And her husband told her very often that she looks a lot like a man. So she's convinced that there is that man that gets out from her and takes… she takes the features of the man. 

00:10:45
JAY HALEY But there is a baby and a man, and who else? 

00:10:45
And there is a girl called … And… survives. She wrote one of those things that ah… 

00:10:55
JAY HALEY Say it again. Melissa… 

00:11:00
…I mean the… my client writes a lot. She expresses herself much more by writing than by talking. And one of the pages it was like… but that seems to be very loving and caring. And she says that there are other people, there about eight people, but she doesn’t… I mean, they don’t have… but they don’t have different names. 

00:11:25
That she's aware of each one now. She's not like blanking out when? I mean, so that's just ah… everybody. 

00:11:30
Yes! We all have different parts of us that talk to us but - or do we? 

00:11:40
JAY HALEY Well, not quite like that. 

00:11:45
(inaudible ), she seems to be… 

00:11:46
JAY HALEY The issue is… is whether she just has a hobby of other people or whether she has other personalities. But it would be very interesting if you had a multiple personality case. Any comment, anybody? What would you do with it to start with? 

00:12:05
What distinguishes a multiple personality from a coping mechanism? You know, I mean… 

00:12:10
JAY HALEY A coping mechanism is just a different idea (inaudible ). A multiple personality, there is a debate whether that's pathological or whether it's… there are people with several personalities. And if so… Milton Erickson didn’t believe it was pathological. He just felt these personalities got into the same body and he worked on bringing them together. 

00:12:35
Yeah. 

00:12:35
Did you find out which one they like to be first? 

00:12:40
JAY HALEY Or at least getting them all communicating with you, so you don’t have periods of amnesia, which is their main problem. But she doesn’t seem to have that. 

00:12:45
She doesn’t seem to. 

00:12:45
JAY HALEY Does she do anything wrong that would put her in danger? I mean, drugs or anything? 

00:12:50
She was using alcohol, but she has stopped. So, she's not… She's not using alcohol anymore. 

00:13:05
JAY HALEY If she comes off the medication, what does she like, do you know? Because you could ask her. 

00:13:10
I asked her about the medication and how it was for her to take the medication. And if it was… She said that she wanted to change it, because it made her dizzy but ah… meaning that she is taking it. 

00:13:25
JAY HALEY Who is her doctor, do you know? Do you have a record of him, if you wanted to talk to him? I mean, that's pretty powerful influence he’s got in the middle of your case. Well, anything else anybody would do with the gentleman ah… this lady and maybe a gentleman, too? 

00:13:45
You know I was thinking maybe she's trying to crossover, I wonder if that's possible, from the African Brazilian ah… way of life into our culture and that's why she's getting the upset. I'm wondering if… 

00:14:10
JAY HALEY It's a quite an adaptation that she's trying to go through, that's right. 

00:14:15
Well, I'm… I'm… you know, I'm saying a… a woman… 

00:14:20
Yeah! 

00:14:20
 …being possessed by this what… whoever it is… 

00:14:25
Oh no! 

00:14:25
…you know, should(ph) be. 

00:14:30
JAY HALEY A spirit possession is the most common religion in the world, you know so it's very big probability(ph) or in her like too. One of the things that's positive in this lady is that she writes. And what do you… How could use that therapy into play? 

00:14:45
I mean, ah… Actually what I'm doing now with the writings is, I don’t know what to do with it right now, but I'm reading what she's writing. And because she is more expressive in her writings, I get to… I mean. try and talk about things that we would not have talked about in the session and take it to the next session and discuss it. And… And I feel that this is a very big… it's powerful tool that she has. 

00:15:15
Use what is positive which was her writing 

00:15:15
JAY HALEY You know, I think there are two ways you could deal with the writing. One is to have her write all her misery that she went through as a child - an autobiography, and hope that relieves it. By writing about it, she gets more objective and distanced from it. The other way is to have her go very positive with the writing so that she describes the way she'd like to be, and what kind of a family she'd like to have, and what kind of a society she'd like to be in. 

00:15:45
Have her write all the bad things or how she would like things to be leading to her goals 

00:15:50
JAY HALEY So, you… you make her come out with her goals in the writing rather than in the talking. So you have to decide two extremes, really, you could go with them. They do something wrong in the… Is she writing novels about people who're wicked? 

00:16:05
Ah… Her feelings, her thoughts. 

00:16:05
JAY HALEY And are they… They are not positive thoughts now? 

00:16:10
No, many of them are not. 

00:16:15
JAY HALEY Well, with that diagnosis she shouldn’t be very cheerful? 

00:16:15
No! 

00:16:20
JAY HALEY Tribologists in the group who was very familiar with Brazilian religions, explained Macumba to the trainees. 

00:16:25
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY , Ph.D. It would be interesting to know whether this client is a practitioner or a follower of any of the African-Brazilian religions, which may be confused with her diagnosis of multiple personality or borderline personality. In many countries where spirit possession is common, it is often difficult to differentiate between acceptable cultural hallucinations and pathology. Spirit religions in Brazil are very popular. People are consulting these healers for all kinds of problems, including physical complaints, marital difficulties and serious mental illness. The mediums receive four major spirits similar to the client’s expression of other selves; the strong and aggressive Indians, the patient and wise old slaves. While possessed by an old slave, this father gives advice to his daughter and grandson, who are much more likely to follow his wishes. They also possess by the playful and innocent children. They also receive ambiguous spirits representing good and evil. Some people say if you put all the spirits together, they make a well-rounded personality. 

00:17:50
OBSERVING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:17:55
I was thinking about you in terms ah… I was reading a book about ah… about Brazil and the spirituality of Brazil. 

00:18:05
JAY HALEY Client describes Macumba to the therapist who inquired about the client’s religion. These directives utilize the African-Brazilian belief system. 

00:18:20
Do you have a guide? You know, a spiritual guide or something? 

00:18:25
It seems that way. 

00:18:25
You can understand. 

00:18:30
Get along with each other. 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:18:55
When you get mad, your… your spirit cannot help, calm you down? 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:05
What can you do for your spirit world? Can you do something for them? 

00:19:10
JAY HALEY Could not utilize a strong spirit guide to help me help help the client nor ask her for the guide's protection. We could not elicit a spirit guide, as Sara said the spirit guide was a secret. Sara said her biggest problem was fear. 

00:19:30
Would it be okay if you write something for me, something of how you would like things to be? 

00:19:35
DISCUSSING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:19:40
I felt that was wonderful that, I mean, the spirit can help her and was so much more powerful that, so all the others are going to be that big and there is only one person in charge. That is great! 

00:19:55
JAY HALEY Did… Did she seem to have amnesia in the room? Why she would say, "what was that question?" 

00:20:00
Yeah! I think that she was being very overwhelmed. She was… She had a lot of feelings coming out today. And I think that she felt really overwhelmed. And I guess it's also… Usually I… I let her talk more and let her lead. Today, I was more of asking her the questions. So, in a sense maybe it's because I didn’t let her get everything out of the way. I don’t know. 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY The woman is afraid of that. You have to find some protection for her. 

00:20:30
Yes. 

00:20:30
JAY HALEY I mean, exploring the fear doesn’t necessarily help. But finding something in the structure to protect her is helpful. And that spirit guide comes along, as when you were saying, it's a helpful creature. 

00:20:45
Thank you so much! Yes, I haven’t seen them. But just, give me a bit of time and I’ll find one. 

00:20:55
JAY HALEY That she says, nobody is interested in the war now, in Vietnam? 

00:21:00
Yeah! 

00:21:00
JAY HALEY And I think she's saying, nobody is interested than my husband and I were. That kind of metaphor she used a few times. But it's also is characteristic of writers. That's how they make their livings with metaphors. 

00:21:15
A couple of years later we read in that paper about the physician who was treating somehow to have all of these people who have multiple personalities and this practice and he (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:21:25
JAY HALEY I… I… I know of one practice that is made up entirely of them. They… They have a curious logic that… that if abuse causes multiple personalities, and if somebody was abused they were multiple personality. So they assume all of them are whoever have been abused. 

00:21:45
This is the first one that I've seen, a couple of people have changed, who said they've changed and I don’t believe it. But this one, I don’t know. This one raises doubt in my mind. 

00:21:55
JAY HALEY They always make 'em… They always have an ambiguity about them. But anyhow, we're gonna have this one tonight and may be… What's the latest? 

00:22:05
PLANNNING THE SECOND LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:22:05
(Inaudible ) pretty depressive stage… Should we close the door? 

00:22:10
That's why you're stopping more often. 

00:22:15
Ah… She was in a crisis center for the weekend, last… the last weekend, the weekend before they kept her for four days. She was very depressed and angry. Ah… 

00:22:25
JAY HALEY At somebody? 

00:22:30
At the government, because they were still after her husband. 

00:22:35
JAY HALEY And her husband still doesn’t come to this country, right? 

00:22:40
He comes and goes. On Saturday there is one of the ladies who lives in the same house as she does who has died. So… And it seems like she was very upset over the phone. 

00:22:55
JAY HALEY You think it will be on that subject? 

00:23:00
So, I'm wondering if you want to… to begin with that. 

00:23:05
JAY HALEY What would you like to have it on? What would you like to focus it on? 

00:23:05
I want to know which direction to go to… with her. I wanted her to have a strong… What we had started, I mean, what you had suggested last time is really building one spirit to help her through whatever so that she feels that strength. I kind of, when she was in the… in the crisis center, I did try to get her back to nature and the strength that she used to get from nature, and she said that it kind of calmed her down a bit. So, she hasn't in her but… 

00:23:40
JAY HALEY Where is she living now? 

00:23:45
Ah… It’s a shelter for multiple diagnoses. 

00:23:50
JAY HALEY For which? 

00:23:50
Multiple diagnoses. People with… 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY Multiple diagnoses? They have a shelter for multiple diagnoses? 

00:24:00
It's a house, and they have group meetings, and ah… they're being taken care of, medicated, sheltered. 

00:24:10
JAY HALEY You have to have several diagnoses to get in there? 

00:24:10
I believe so, yes. Ah… At least two. 

00:24:20
JAY HALEY But she's living there and is she working? 

00:24:25
No! 

00:24:25
JAY HALEY What is her income? 

00:24:25
Her income… Oh! I believe that she gets social benefits. 

00:24:30
Find out more about her in the real world 

00:24:35
JAY HALEY I'd try to find out the real world for her - of where she lives or where her husband is or what friends does she have, what kind of a job she is looking for? 

00:24:45
She wants to write and sell her stories. 

00:24:50
JAY HALEY That’s a tough… tough way to live. 

00:24:55
Yeah! 

00:24:55
JAY HALEY But ah… that’s at least something practical. In a far-off land you can… if you're good enough, you can publish stories. But you don’t know ah… whether when her husband comes she sees him? 

00:25:15
She does. There are things that do not match up. 

00:25:20
JAY HALEY Ah…Uh… 

00:25:20
You know. Probably, I mean… I don't know. Probably this session (inaudible ) a lot about the grief, but how can I… 

00:25:30
JAY HALEY Yeah! I would… If I were you, you'd be worried about how she’s interesting you with these warming human dramas that she's involved in. That is… There ought to be a way to test it experimentally, is to bring up something and see if she then develops that, because she knows you're interested in that, you know. I mean, she… you’re her audience, it's what it sounds like. There's… There’re not many friends or people around her. 

00:26:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:00
JAY HALEY And you must be very important to her? 

00:26:05
I think I am and it's getting a bit scary. She really wants to see me twice a week. And I'm wondering whether it is in her best interest too. On the contrary, I’ll be pushing dependency on her, you know. 

00:26:20
JAY HALEY Who… How often do you see her now? 

00:26:20
Now I see her just once a week. 

00:26:25
JAY HALEY Hmm…Hmm… But I would think about some of what she says is exaggerated as a storyteller. I'd also, somebody who's interesting you so you'll keep on seeing her. What is your destiny with her? How long will you see her? 

00:26:50
As long as she needs to see me. 

00:26:50
JAY HALEY But how long… How long will you be available? 

00:26:55
For about a year. 

00:26:55
JAY HALEY About a year ah? Does she know that? 

00:27:00
Yes, she does. And she's very motivated. She’s even willing to see two different therapists if I cannot see her, you know. She really wants to get better. She really wants to get better. Or does she want a bigger social system, now that you raised this question? 

00:27:20
JAY HALEY Can she ah… describe what better is? 

00:27:25
I don’t know. 

00:27:30
JAY HALEY I'd just try to get clear a goal, you know, to ask her… to say the therapy is to help people who can’t solve a problem. What ah… What does she need? And how… How will she… How would she be over it when she's over it? Does she need to go to work? Does she need another man? What… What her destiny is, you know? 

00:27:50
Hmm… What she wants from therapy is to be able to live with herself. 

00:27:55
JAY HALEY Well, she has no alternative. She’s gotto live with herself. 

00:28:00
Yes, I think so. 

00:28:00
JAY HALEY But she must indicate she doesn’t care for part of herself then. Well, let’s think of doing an interview where if she says like, something like that, that she wants to do something about herself. I'd go to… How would you know you had that or? What… What is the practical thing you can do to achieve that? 

00:28:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:28:20
JAY HALEY  But I'd try to get some more facts about her life, you know. How she supports herself? And why she's in the shelter instead of getting a job and getting an apartment? She’s a bright woman. Has that ever come up? 

00:28:40
No, no! She doesn't even… I mean, she's fine in the shelter. She likes the shelter. She feels safe and secure in the shelter. And even though security is not something that she thrives on, because she was in hiding for about five years with her husband. 

00:29:00
JAY HALEY Ah…Uh… And they won’t hunt for her in the shelter, whoever might be after her? 

00:29:10
It sounds like it’s in a movie thing, yeah. 

00:29:10
That… That supports this idea that she needs an audience if it's like the movies. 

00:29:15
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:29:15
Movies doesn’t exist without an audience. 

00:29:20
Hmm… 

00:29:20
JAY HALEY It’s hard to sell a story, but some people sell movie scripts if they're imaginative enough. How would you like this interview to end today? 

00:29:30
I would like to be on the right track - to know how to continue with her? This is, I guess, I maybe forcing the end, so there'll be an answer. I'm telling you what I… what I would like. 

00:29:45
JAY HALEY Well, it would be nice if you… Yeah, it'll be nice if you ended the interview feeling something satisfying. I would be satisfied if we knew more about her in the real world, because she lives in a metaphoric world - if you read her writings. You gentlemen have a suggestion? 

00:30:10
You mean the outcome of this meeting(ph)? 

00:30:10
JAY HALEY No, what to do with it? 

00:30:15
I like the idea that you're having that ah… we need more clarification on what type of a lifestyle she's living right now. Ah… She’s very comfortable living the way she's living right now. I think it sounds like the more she sensationalizes a lot of the events in her life to keep her in a very secure and nice arena. 

00:30:40
JAY HALEY The shelter. Since they… If you get her first to say that she's… she enjoys it there and likes it there but… and get her to say she has to leave sometime, because you can’t stay forever in a shelter. 

00:30:55
Right! 

00:30:55
Set a date to begin to be normal 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY And then have her state a date and begin to organize that therapy toward that date. Because then she has to get a job, she has to find a place to live, she has to cultivate some friends. I mean, the various things she'd have to do when she left the shelter. In the shelter she can stay there as long as she wants? 

00:31:15
I think (inaudible ) I'm any good in this type of thing. 

00:31:20
JAY HALEY Well, I think one of the things about it is you're a very nice person and she likes you. And it's… it's easy to be kind to her, when you need to be more firm with her, I think, really, about making some plans for her future. 

00:31:35
Yeah. 

00:31:35
JAY HALEY And after all, living with… people with multiple diagnoses is… is not the most pleasant time in the world. They must be pretty difficult people, for two diagnoses. I mean, one, I can maybe so. 

00:31:50
Two is one too many. 

00:31:55
Would you predict some acting out if you were to set a date for her to leave? I mean, would you predict for her to, you know, somehow sabotage that, somehow create that crisis? 

00:32:05
She would get probably into a deep depression crisis. 

00:32:10
JAY HALEY I would predict… 

00:32:10
Crying and go straight to the hospital. 

00:32:15
To avoid a relapse, predict one. 

00:32:15
JAY HALEY I would predict that with her, if you think it'll happen, and say you're going to begin to resist this and you'll begin to develop symptoms so you can’t leave. What kind of symptoms would you prefer, you know? 

00:32:30
Would you prefer? Yeah! 

00:32:30
JAY HALEY Because if you anticipate it, it's harder for her to do it. 

00:32:35
Hmm…Hmm… I'm going to let her talk about the death of her friend. 

00:32:40
JAY HALEY Oh yeah, you have to deal with that, sure. 

00:32:40
Yeah! And then I’ll try to see, from there I’ll try and go towards the goal of leaving, and when does she think she might be able to do that, and what… how would she do it, and what are the problems that she might be ah… facing. 

00:33:05
JAY HALEY Sure! I would ask her if she knows whether she’ll have to leave, if there is a limit. 

00:33:10
OBSERVING THE SECOND INTERVIEW 

00:33:15
JAY HALEY Client describes the death of her housemate in detail. 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:25
JAY HALEY The client talks about her fears, particularly in relation to her husband. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:45
JAY HALEY All of the directive is focused on practical matters. 

00:33:50
Can you make that a little violet(ph)? 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:34:00
So I'm wondering if you're still thinking about that? Are you… Are you wondering she wants to be (inaudible ), you, yourself (crosstalk) (inaudible) this roommate that you did when you just (inaudible ) and stuff and… 

00:34:20
JAY HALEY There is a man in your life. 

00:34:20
Oh! You're not supposed to be upset. That you're not supposed to be upset at all. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:45
JAY HALEY Do you want to protect anyone? 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:35:00
T: What would you like to get out of our meetings? 

00:35:00
S: I want to get help. 

00:35:05
T: How will you know that you are getting the help? How will I know that I am giving you the help? 

00:35:05
S: That don't sound right.... 

00:35:15
Because… No, I'm not… It's just because I want to know what direction to go in. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:30
JAY HALEY I would like you to have something normal. 

00:35:40
[sil.] 

00:35:55
Exactly, exactly. 

00:35:55
JAY HALEY The therapy is talking about the interesting problems. 

00:36:00
DISCUSSING THE SECOND INTERVIEW 

00:36:00
Yeah! 

00:36:00
JAY HALEY And bizarre experiences and fears and so on. Talking to her earlier about being normal might have been upsetting her, like getting a job. She… She saw immediately it should be a job. 

00:36:15
Yeah. 

00:36:15
JAY HALEY If I understand her right, she's supporting her husband? We are supporting her. 

00:36:20
Yes! 

00:36:20
Yes! This is so nice of all of you. 

00:36:25
JAY HALEY But she changed when you gave her a directive - even a simple one like that. She got very serious. 

00:36:35
 Yeah! 

00:36:35
JAY HALEY I don’t think that very funny. 

00:36:35
She was so weird today. She was really odd today. I could not feel her from the beginning of the whole session. 

00:36:45
JAY HALEY So in the beginning she was far off. I think that’s right. 

00:36:50
When she changed her position, she became a different person to me. 

00:36:50
Yes! 

00:36:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:36:50
When she was bent over and… I don’t know if it was because you were changing your que… the way of dealing with her or it was a way, and she just changed. 

00:37:05
And that was the picture of her younger brother and a picture of her when she was ten. 

00:37:10
JAY HALEY Where’s her brother? 

00:37:10
He still lives in Brazil with his mother, with their mother. And he's the only one who has not really been abused by the father. 

00:37:20
JAY HALEY And the mother ah… Do you know anything about the mother? 

00:37:25
The mother lives in Brazil and she's… she has her little house. 

00:37:30
JAY HALEY Does she work or? 

00:37:35
No! Not that… 

00:37:35
JAY HALEY Do they support her? 

00:37:35
The children do. 

00:37:40
JAY HALEY I was wondering back here about her mother, she hadn’t been mentioned. And it seemed like… it's obvious that she should be mentioned. 

00:37:45
Yeah! 

00:37:45
JAY HALEY I think she'd be very important in this case(ph). 

00:37:50
Okay! 

00:37:50
JAY HALEY Once… Once you have the mother in the picture, you can take a simple directive like that and turn it into a letter to her mother or a telephone call. 

00:38:00
Do family therapy at a distance with letters. 

00:38:05
JAY HALEY She could write her mother a letter saying I've been having hard times but now I'm normal, yeah, or I'm getting back to normal. And then… She's obligated to do that - to support the letter. But you can do things like that. 

00:38:20
How do I deal with her fear that I am abandoning her? 

00:38:25
JAY HALEY Well, there's different things to do. 

00:38:30
First of all, lower own reaction to that. I'm very upset. 

00:38:35
Oh just don't abandon her! 

00:38:40
I'm not, but she feels that I want out. 

00:38:40
JAY HALEY What you can do, if you're really are worried about it, is call her. 

00:38:45
Yeah! 

00:38:45
JAY HALEY Say, when we left, we were talking about you becoming normal and getting a job and you seem to think that would mean, would have to leave therapy, but maybe you don’t. I want you to continue or something like that. 

00:39:00
But isn’t there some truth that when she does become normal and she'll would leave therapy? 

00:39:05
JAY HALEY That’s right! That’s the discovery a lot of patients make. That has been the case of those in analysis for 18 years 

00:39:10
And she said something that she's been in therapy for a long time. So if she gets normal, she's gonna lose a lot. She's gonna lose therapy, she's gonna lose the place where she lives, she's gonna lose the support. 

00:39:25
JAY HALEY Her disability. 

00:39:25
Lose her disability. There's a lot to lose being normal. 

00:39:30
JAY HALEY Her husband, probably, if she's not supporting him. 

00:39:30
Real world, she doesn’t have… 

00:39:30
JAY HALEY She's adventurous. 

00:39:35
Yeah! It's very exciting and scary, and all these things, but it’s not… it's not, going to a job everyday and trying to cope in the real world would be very boring and… 

00:39:45
Do you wanna a child? Are you… Are you (inaudible ) to have a child? 

00:39:51
Are you afraid to have a child? 

00:39:51
Are you afraid to have a child? What… What was the plot behind that? That (inaudible ). 

00:39:57
JAY HALEY Unless that you are talking about getting a job and doing all the normal things. Having a husband is normal, having a child is normal. And so I just suggested that. But also, apparently, that convinces many women, their life is a little more serious than they thought. They begin to think whether they can have a child or is it too late. I think she has been thinking about it every time she saw a kid. 

00:40:25
Are you going to visit your husband, which is another thing to do if he's so far away. So, it's all about creating normalcy. 

00:40:35
JAY HALEY Well, you know, it's partly what I was thinking of reacting to last week's… the last interview with her, where she was bizarre and weird and you followed-up and we followed-up the various ideas that might lead to this or that. And the idea that she's in here in order to get over with these problems and be a normal person and you tend to forget it when it gets fascinating. And the patient often forgets it - thinking therapy is where you talk about abnormal things. And it's not a place where you get practical and get a job. Sara expressed her interest in being normal by calling the therapist at 5:00am to say she had two job interviews. The therapist finished her training program and so the end of that therapy. Some months later, Sara called the therapist to say she was being expelled from the abuse shelter for smoking marijuana. She was on the street for two days and went to a homeless shelter. She said the rules were too strict and she left. She also said she was too tired to work. We did not know whether she wrote to her mother in Brazil, following our suggestion for family therapy at a distance. This was a difficult case to work with in such a short period of time. The film shows the approach used rather than a finished case. There are many reasons for switching course from the first interview from utilizing the African Brazilian religions, to the second interview, where they are minimized. Sara's belief system was not fully developed and she did not receive these prescribed alternate selves in special places like a ceremony. If she had manifested the spirit guide, I would have suggested that this spirit guide offer her protection and help her get back to work. Because this was the therapist’s first case and she was enthralled with its eccentricities, it was not practical to supervise her by delving into complicated cultural systems. I believed that the client needed to redefine therapy as not a place to be interesting and create mysterious scenarios, but to do something to get over the problem. 

00:42:40
Use-what is positive which was her writing Have her write all the bad things or how she would like things to be, leading to her goals 

00:42:40
JAY HALEY My direction was one; to utilize what was positive in the client, which was her writing, have her write all the bad things or have her write how she would like things to be, leading to her goals. 

00:42:50
Do family therapy at a distance with letters. 

00:42:55
JAY HALEY Number two; have her contact her family and do family therapy at a distance through a letter. 

00:42:55
Have her act normally, which she defined as getting a job. 

00:43:00
JAY HALEY Three; have her act normally, which she defined as getting a job. Then there was the problem of whether Sara was a multiple personality or expressing different personalities in cultural terms. Because she did not show amnesia, and I did not work with her as a multiple personality and decided to deal with her structurally and guiding her into a normal life. On a more general level, this case illustrates the problem of dealing with ethnicity issues in supervision of a case. Cultural sensitivity is pathetically(ph) correct these days, and often cultural exploration may prolong the therapy rather than make it even better. When to utilize belief systems and when to minimize them is a decision which the therapist must confront in almost every case where therapists and clients come from a variety of backgrounds. In general, I request courtesy and respect for cultural differences while dealing with cases practically.
