GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:04:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE This couple, Amber and Daniel are here with their therapist, Terra. He is from Honduras, she is from California. They've been married almost seven years. They have a little boy, Danielito, ten months old. They have had four therapy sessions with Terra. We will have a reflecting team as part of the session. The first part of this session, I'll talk with Daniel and Amber. In the second part, we will listen to the comments of the reflecting team and follow that with the responses of the couple. As a couple, they met in Honduras while Amber was doing missionary work for the church. They knew each other for a brief time, and they wrote each other. He came to the United States and they got married. With this brief relationship, they started to have conflict after five years. Problems started with the birth of their child. They came to therapy because they fight after 20 minutes of talking to each other. Amber says that Daniel didn't know what he was getting into when they married. I asked, "who has the most power in the relationship?" They said, " Amber has the most power." Part of the conversation is that Daniel is taking care of his baby, contrary to the role in his tradition. Amber is working at her medical residency, also contradictory of his cultural values. They would like to have more traditional roles. She would like to mother the child, and he would like to return to work. Daniel values what Amber is doing. But sometimes it is important to return to traditional roles. I didn't know anything about these people. It was a good idea to meet for about half an hour, have a reflecting team, we'll switch to the other side of the mirror. This is a case where we have issues of gender values, culture, race and social class. What was your idea to have the couple come in for a session? 

00:04:45
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:05:00
TERRA Because we've met a number of times, and we're not getting anywhere. 

00:05:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:05:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How many sessions have you had? 

00:05:05
TERRA [non-English narration] 

00:05:10
TERRA Seven sessions. 

00:05:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:05:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What's happening with them? 

00:05:15
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:05:45
TERRA There isn't anything happening. It's the same, the same, the same. So if I said to Amber, "maybe he could help is with an idea." Another point of view. Because we are, How do you say? 

00:05:45
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:05:45
AMBER Stuck. 

00:05:45
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:05:50
DANIEL Stuck. 

00:05:50
TERRA [non-English narration] 

00:05:55
TERRA I think that maybe, we are able to learn. 

00:05:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:06:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE I told the reflecting that we could stop the session if they were difficult. Sometimes even in an easy case you can get stuck. 

00:06:10
TERRA [non-English narration] 

00:06:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:06:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE This maybe a problem that is very easy. 

00:06:15
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:06:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:06:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Let's talk with them. How receptive were you to the idea of this meeting? 

00:06:35
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:06:45
DANIEL Terra spoke with my wife and I agreed that it would be a good idea. 

00:06:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:06:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What would you like to accomplish in this session? 

00:06:50
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:06:55
DANIEL That our relationship would improve. 

00:06:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:06:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How would you know that it improved? 

00:06:55
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:07:05
DANIEL That we can have a longer conversation. 

00:07:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Okay. Amber? 

00:07:05
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:07:15
AMBER We can't talk for more than 20 minutes without grrrr. 

00:07:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:07:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE We have 20 minutes and then, grrr? 

00:07:20
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:07:30
AMBER We like each other. No, we love each other. We each have our own superior point of view. We don't put it in words, but we understand it. I don't want to lower myself and say, "okay, and that's fine." So there are many arguments. Many, many disagreements. I don't want my baby to grow up in this atmosphere. 

00:07:30
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:08:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How old is your child? 

00:08:00
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:08:00
AMBER Ten months. 

00:08:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:08:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Boy or girl? 

00:08:00
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:08:05
AMBER Boy. 

00:08:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:08:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What's his name? 

00:08:05
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:08:05
AMBER What do you think? 

00:08:05
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:08:10
TERRA Danielito 

00:08:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:08:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Oh, What did I think? How long have you been together? 

00:08:20
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:08:25
DANIEL Seven years. 

00:08:25
TERRA [non-English narration] 

00:08:30
TERRA He remembered! 

00:08:30
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:08:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Why did she say that? Do you forget? 

00:08:35
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:08:40
DANIEL I don't forget, but these dates are important to her. In my culture these dates are not important. One year is like the next year. 

00:08:40
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:08:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What do you do? 

00:08:55
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:08:55
DANIEL I'm taking care of the baby. 

00:08:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:09:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE And you work away from the house? 

00:09:00
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:09:00
AMBER Mhmm. 

00:09:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:09:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What is it that you do? 

00:09:00
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:09:05
AMBER I'm finishing my residency in family medicine. 

00:09:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:09:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Here at the hospital at Lomo Linda? 

00:09:10
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:09:10
AMBER No. In the County. 

00:09:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:09:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE When will you be done? 

00:09:15
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:09:20
AMBER In July. 

00:09:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:09:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE That must be difficult. You're taking care of the baby and you're practicing the science of medicine. 

00:09:25
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:09:50
AMBER I say that if he knew what he was getting into, he probably would not have married me. He married me and three months later, I started medical school. 

00:09:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:10:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE For seven years, you've been married and you've been studying medicine. How did you come to these decisions? Did you have conversations about who would stay home with the baby or was it a surprise? 

00:10:20
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:10:25
DANIEL I believe we've talked about it. 

00:10:25
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:10:30
AMBER Many times. As soon as I knew was pregnant and I didn't want to quit school, and I don't have family here. So Daniel would have to stay with the baby. 

00:10:30
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:10:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Who is with Danielito now? 

00:10:45
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:10:45
AMBER At this moment? 

00:10:45
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:10:50
DANIEL A friend of ours. 

00:10:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:11:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE When you get stuck, is it typically in conversations like this? It's almost twenty minutes, I should probably hurry up. Is it in conversations like this that they get stuck? 

00:11:20
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:12:05
TERRA Like Daniel said, it's in communication. Amber says that sometimes he isn't efficiency enough around the house. He is out of work and he has many little things to do that he doesn't feel good about. He is able to do it but he has a longer day. Amber tells him what to do but he won't do anything. 

00:12:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:12:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Like what kind of things? 

00:12:05
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:12:10
DANIEL Cleaning? Cooking? 

00:12:10
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:12:50
TERRA Things around the house, for example, like vacuuming. Things that Daniel promises to do. But then it isn't good enough for her. This causes friction between them. Normally, they have a breakdown in communication. They don't intend it. Is it this way Amber? 

00:12:50
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:12:50
AMBER Yeah. 

00:12:50
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:13:00
TERRA I can see that they care about each other and they keep coming for therapy. 

00:13:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:13:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How do you get the impression that they are a couple? 

00:13:00
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:13:05
TERRA They really love each other. 

00:13:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:13:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How did you get the impression that they love each other? 

00:13:10
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:13:15
TERRA For me it is their religion. They come together for their religion. That's how they met. Amber was working as a missionary. 

00:13:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:13:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Which religion. Amber? 

00:13:35
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:13:40
AMBER Church of Christ (Iglesia de Christo). 

00:13:40
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:14:25
TERRA This is what attracted them to each other. My impression is that when they came here that he left the church. It is important to Amber that she keeps God in her life for her and her baby. My impression is that if they went back to what attracted them to each other, there wouldn't be so much friction. 

00:14:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:14:30
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Who do you think agrees with you more? 

00:14:30
TERRA  [non-English narration] 

00:14:35
TERRA Amber. Because they have told me that brought them together. They did like a church and they started going to, but after they here he didn't like the new church. When they changed to Pomona and they changed to a new church, then Daniel didn't like the new church. They tried other churches to find one that they both liked. But Daniel won't try them more than one time and this is not sufficient time to know if he likes it. The last time they saw me they told me they were going to go together to a church in San Diego, this week. She and Daniel would very much like to go to church together, but this very far to travel. 

00:14:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:15:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE These problems that you are seeing Terra about, when did the begin? 

00:15:50
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:15:55
AMBER About five years, mmm? 

00:15:55
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:16:00
DANIEL Four or five years. 

00:16:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:16:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How did you decide to come to see Terra now and not five years ago? 

00:16:15
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:16:20
DANIEL Because we have a baby now. 

00:16:20
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:16:25
AMBER It got to a point where I said "No more!" 

00:16:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:16:30
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What happened to get you to the point of "no more"? 

00:16:30
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:17:30
AMBER I am constantly at that point. I don't recall exactly what happened. But I told him, look. And he had to do things that were opposite for him, things like a woman would do, for a Latino man, I oppress him. I make him take care of the baby, I make him cook and there are other things that in his culture are done by a woman. But, this before all this, it is sensible. Then you have to do your part, what makes sense. I heard on the radio the "Christian Counseling Center", they said "visit us" to talk about problems. We both agreed that we had a problem, but the thing is 

00:17:30
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:17:30
DANIEL We're not going to agree on this point. 

00:17:30
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:17:35
AMBER Each one. 

00:17:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:17:40
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:17:55
DANIEL We don't believe that we could reconcile the things that have happened. It is necessary for us to stay together. We are not having a physical relationship, nothing passes between us. But we don't believe that we have to bring this up. 

00:17:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:18:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE This story that you have about how Latino men are. How did you arrive at it? 

00:18:05
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:18:15
DANIEL It seems to me that I learned it in the past. This is a better choice for us. 

00:18:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:18:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Do you feel that you are in a different territory? 

00:18:20
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:18:25
DANIEL Yes. 

00:18:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:18:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Is it like an adventure or would you rather it was over? How do you see it? Both maybe, I don't know. 

00:18:35
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:18:35
AMBER How do you feel when you change a diaper? 

00:18:35
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:18:50
DANIEL When a baby is a year old, you take of it. For me this is normal. 

00:18:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:18:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE For now, you do it. 

00:18:50
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:18:55
DANIEL For now, you do it. 

00:18:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:19:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How do you feel? Proud, happy, or would you rather not do it? 

00:19:10
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:19:15
DANIEL Sometimes I feel proud that I take care of the baby. 

00:19:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:19:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Your connection is strong isn't it? 

00:19:20
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:19:25
DANIEL With the baby and me? Yes. 

00:19:25
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:19:25
AMBER I am jealous. 

00:19:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:19:25
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:20:15
AMBER I'm jealous because you get to be in the house with him and I'm not able to be with him. But I feel good that he is with his daddy. It is better for him for this passing time. He said, "I really want to go to work". He doesn't leave the house. He doesn't go anywhere with the baby. He is isolated. I'll get a babysitter if you want. He doesn't want this. He's happy. Then I say, "think about it and I'll ask you again tomorrow." Then I bring it up again and he says, I'm not able to leave Danny. 

00:20:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:20:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE It's a super-responsibility. Have you met any other men who take care of their children? 

00:20:25
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:20:25
DANIEL Yes, I have some friends. 

00:20:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:20:30
GONZALO BACIGALUPE And do you go out and meet them with the children? 

00:20:30
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:20:40
DANIEL No, I don't take him out. He is little and it's a great responsibility. What if an accident happened? I prefer to stay home. 

00:20:40
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:20:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE How come? 

00:20:45
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:20:50
DANIEL Things could happen and he is so small. 

00:20:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:21:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE You think something will happen or he'll get sick or you'll forget about him? 

00:21:00
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:21:10
DANIEL I'm so afraid to have a big accident in the car with him. I prefer to stay in the house with him. 

00:21:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:21:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE You're up to your neck in staying in the house. 

00:21:20
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:21:25
DANIEL More or less. 

00:21:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:21:40
GONZALO BACIGALUPE You need to invent a new road. Amber, you did say that he didn't know what he was getting into when you two got together. 

00:21:40
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:21:40
AMBER Poor little thing. 

00:21:40
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:21:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Why poor little thing? 

00:21:45
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:22:35
AMBER We didn't know each other well. He came here on a visa for 60 days and we got married. He couldn't stay here because he didn't have a visa. I remember we spoke to each other for ten minutes on the telephone each month. He came with a visa "prometida", that we had to marry in sixty days or they would kick him out. We got married but we hadn't seen each other for nine months. And in that time we only knew each other for two months and I really didn't know him. 

00:22:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:22:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Was it love at first sight? 

00:22:35
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:22:55
AMBER I always say no because we had so much time together for two months. But, we knew each other, but we didn't know each other very well. We didn't talk about profound things. 

00:22:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:23:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Did one of these things include responsibilities while you were studying medicine? 

00:23:00
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:23:35
AMBER No, one of them should have been the differences in our cultures. One of the things is that he changed his relationship to the congregation and with God. He said that the Christians here were two-faced. They have money and people suffer but they don't help the people. This was the foundation. I only knew him in the church. Everything that we did for two months was in respect to my job with the Christians youth camp. In respect to him, he was studying to be a preacher. This was our life for this short time. Then after he came here he feels like not the same person. This is the base. This is the foundation for the relationship. I don't believe that everything has to be perfect, but if he would return to God, it would help. 

00:23:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:24:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE When you became a couple your relationship with God changed and that complicated things. Do you feel that way too, Daniel? 

00:24:50
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:24:55
DANIEL Yes. 

00:24:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:25:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Does your relationship with God continue to be problematic? More problematic than your relationship with Amber? 

00:25:05
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:25:40
DANIEL I always want to be honest with God. I don't want to be two-faced. I don't want to be unfaithful to God. My soccer teams are not Christian in the way that they were Christian in Honduras. Here it is a different life. Here I don't feel comfortable with the church. It's better that I don't go. 

00:25:40
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:25:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Has your relationship with the church changed or with God? 

00:25:45
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:25:50
DANIEL With God and with my wife. This is the base of my belief. 

00:25:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:25:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Have you lost your belief? 

00:25:55
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:26:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:26:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What have you lost? 

00:26:00
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:26:35
DANIEL I've lost my love for God. I have faith but not love for God or the congregation. She is the opposite, she is on a team every day. I think that things changed when I came to this country. It's not my fault. I don't know what happened but when I came here things changed. 

00:26:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:26:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Whose fault is it? 

00:26:35
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:27:05
DANIEL I think that maybe something happened when I got here, maybe. The atmosphere was different then. We would have barbeque and beer and other things. 

00:27:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:27:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE This is before you had the baby? 

00:27:10
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:27:10
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:27:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:27:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE And you didn't have a relationship with other couples. 

00:27:15
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:27:20
AMBER Clearly. 

00:27:20
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:27:20
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:27:50
AMBER When I arrive it is always the same. He's up to here. He has to get out. He's been home with the baby all day. He has to go and see his friends. Sometimes he's gone the whole night until the next day. 

00:27:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:28:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Two important things have changed for him. The relationship to religion and the full-time role that you are playing. This is very important. Do you have conversations about the changes? 

00:28:50
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:28:55
DANIEL We go our separate ways. I go one way, she goes the other way. 

00:28:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:29:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Your relationship has to have things in common before the relationship can reach communion. 

00:29:05
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:29:15
AMBER We look for this but it is very difficult with the level of education. 

00:29:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:29:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Do you find friends at the hospital? 

00:29:25
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:29:40
AMBER He feels comfortable with blue collar folks. I think I can fit either way but clearly I like stimulating conversation. 

00:29:40
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:29:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE You have a barrier with religion, class and culture. 

00:29:45
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:29:50
AMBER It's difficult to become a couple. 

00:29:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:30:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE In some context do you feel unwelcome because of the color of your skirt? 

00:30:00
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:30:25
DANIEL No. I don't think so. When I'm together with her friend, I can't talk about medicine but neither can she talk with my friends about soccer. 

00:30:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:30:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE It's difficult for each of you to speak the other's language. 

00:30:35
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:31:10
AMBER We have one couple we are friends with. She is a nurse and her husband is Mexican. They have a little girl but they live far away. They are Christian, but the last time I saw them I went alone. I don't know why Daniel doesn't believe he can't earn a living. I don't know. 

00:31:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:31:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Who has the most power in the relationship? 

00:31:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:31:20
DANIEL I think it is her. 

00:31:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:31:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Has it always been that way, that she has more power? 

00:31:25
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:32:00
DANIEL I think that when I'm working, I feel good. I take care of the woman like a woman. I don't provide for the family like a man. That's what I have in my mind. I have a lot of respect for her. We talk about things together. 

00:32:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:32:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Is it always like that, she had more power? 

00:32:05
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:32:15
AMBER I think so. Because he is in my culture. He follows me. 

00:32:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:32:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE I have a lot of thoughts. A lot of things occur to me and I'm thinking about the people behind the mirror. Do you feel more balanced since you're taking care of the baby? Do you have more power in the relationship? Do you have the impression that helps balance the power? You are more connected with your son. You have a relationship with him. 

00:32:55
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:33:00
DANIEL Perhaps. It's an important role. 

00:33:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:33:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Your work is maternal. The responsibility of mothering is not appreciated in this culture. The responsibility of taking care of children is not valued in this culture. Did something happen when he started taking care of the baby? 

00:33:25
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:33:45
AMBER I haven't given it much thought. I am jealous. I would like to be home and play with the baby. And he's the one who's taking care of the baby. I wish it were me. 

00:33:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:33:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What do you think would happen if it were you? 

00:33:45
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:33:55
AMBER I wouldn't put stereo in full blast all day. The poor baby isn't yet one year old and he's dancing already. 

00:33:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:34:00
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:34:15
AMBER That's what a mother feels, but I have to go to work every day. It's difficult. 

00:34:15
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:34:20
GONZALO BACIGALUPE If you were taking care of the baby, then Daniel would be doing blue collar work. 

00:34:20
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:34:25
AMBER I have two hundred thousand dollars to pay in student loans. 

00:34:25
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:34:30
GONZALO BACIGALUPE If you switch places, could you do it? 

00:34:30
AMBER  [non-English narration] 

00:34:40
AMBER When I repay the money, I can stay at home. I have to repay the loan or this education that I don't even want anymore. 

00:34:40
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:34:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE So you would like to have a typical role? 

00:34:45
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:34:50
AMBER As soon as we repay the loan, I'll stay at home. 

00:34:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:34:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Is this okay with you? 

00:34:50
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:35:00
DANIEL It's okay. Her career is very hard. 

00:35:00
AMBER [non-English narration] 

00:35:00
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:35:55
DANIEL She works a lot. When I first came to this country, I didn't have any idea. I never worked in construction in Honduras because it was a seaport and people can support and people can support themselves fishing. Six months after I came, I started working in construction and I didn't know how to work. I left the house for work at four in the morning and came home at six in the evening. The people in our country just passed through life. To earn a living is not easy. 

00:35:55
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:36:00
GONZALO BACIGALUPE What does your family say about your responsibilities? 

00:36:00
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:36:05
DANIEL They were surprised. 

00:36:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:36:05
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Surprised--it was unusual. 

00:36:05
DANIEL [non-English narration] 

00:36:10
DANIEL Very rare. 

00:36:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:36:10
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Did anyone in your family find it fantastic? 

00:36:10
DANIEL  [non-English narration] 

00:36:35
DANIEL When my sister came here she didn't know that I cooked. I never cooked at home. I can cook Hondurans style. But she doesn't cook. I had to cook. 

00:36:35
GONZALO BACIGALUPE  [non-English narration] 

00:36:45
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Okay, we are going to switch with the reflecting team. 

00:36:45
KARINA  [non-English narration] 

00:37:50
KARINA My name is Karina. I was listening to Daniel and thinking about the way his family looks at his taking care of his child. He didn't know how to take care of the baby, but he did it, and he probably has become a good cook. Although she envies his staying home with the child, he's doing a good job at this. It's clear that he doesn't like it. Things are difficult and they are not rose colored. 

00:37:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE [non-English narration] 

00:37:50
GONZALO BACIGALUPE Then which other color? 

00:37:50
KARINA  [non-English narration] 

00:38:40
KARINA It is my impression that with this couple what I see is that there has been a switch in roles. They've managed to get the best of both worlds. He gets to take care of his child. And he's doing well and his son gets to be in his house with his daddy. And he is not pre-occupied with anything else and at the same time, Amber doesn't have to worry because the baby is safe with his papa. I feel that Amber thinks that he has taken away her role as the mother. 

00:38:40
MARIA  [non-English narration] 

00:40:25
MARIA I'll go next. My name is Maria. I have great admiration for Daniel. I think that he is very brave to have taken this role. In the Hispanic culture a man goes to work to be the provider and the woman stays at home. He has done this so that he can be with his son and also he makes it possible for his wife to be in school. To me this is very admirable. Even though he says that he doesn't know anything about medicine and she isn't interested in soccer, they need to be a bit more interested in what each other is doing. When she doesn't know about soccer and he doesn't know about medicine. They need to be a little bit interested. They live in the same house. They should share ideas. My husband is a mechanic and I ask him about mechanical things. What he is doing is helpful to me, so for me it is very important. So they should talk with each other more, it would help with their communications. 

00:40:25
SONDRA  [non-English narration] 

00:43:00
SONDRA What I have to say sounds a little like what Karina said. My name is Sondra. Daniel has the privilege in being the father privilege that most of the time only women have of taking care of their children. Because of the roles they are talking, it will bring Amber and Daniel closer together. Daniel is having the opportunity to have a relationship with his son that most of the time only women have with their children. At this moment, Amber is only seeing things the way they used to be. He needs to give a little more to Amber when she us unable to have more time with her child and equally, she needs to give a little more to Daniel. They are having these major differences in regard to religion. Perhaps at this moment everything looks either black or white. Before this it was entirely involvement in the Church of Christ. And now it is entirely separation from his church. Before he played soccer and after he drank beer and ate barbecue but now it has changed. He has lost something. I want to know what is different for him. At this moment he sees everything is white or black. And Amber is in a totally different place. From her perspective they are in entirely different places. They both need to explore the religion part a little more. He's taking a little bit more, but he need to become more clear. Why has he distanced himself so much from the church? Because here it is a little bit different. 

00:43:00
CLARICE  [non-English narration] 

00:43:55
CLARICE My name is Clarice. He has come to a place that is completely different from Honduras. In this country everything is different for him, especially culturally. Everything is different for them. He is in the role of the mother taking care of his son. So everything is changed a lot for the couple. He has lot of difficulties, he came to a new country and everything is reversed. Maybe he has a hard time expressing that to her and he has a hard time understanding that. They don't see each other's point of view. 

00:43:55
KARINA  [non-English narration] 

00:45:20
KARINA I've been thinking about Daniel and the church. I think that Daniel has not separated the two, going to church and having a relationship with God. I feel like they'll stay together but there is no glue. It is not necessary for me, for me, it is not necessary to go to church every day or every Sunday to have a relationship with God. He doesn't experience a solution. He says the new churches don't feel like him. I don't feel that going to church is the same as having a relationship to God. I feel that Daniel hasn't reconciled these things. I feel that, I have the sense of that he says that the people have two faces, and that he is not able to go to a new church. He doesn't completely understand the experience he is having. This is how he's experiencing this. 

00:45:20
MARIA  [non-English narration] 

00:46:05
MARIA I would like to address their different levels of education. I know because I am a mother, how I would feel having to be the provider and leave the family at home. The couples is out of balance. He feels like this and she feels like this. If they could become more balanced, it would help them. 

00:46:05
