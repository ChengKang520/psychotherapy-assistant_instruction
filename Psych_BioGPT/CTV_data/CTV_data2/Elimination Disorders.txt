ELIMINATION DISORDERS 

00:00:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Discussions involving urine and feces can often be treated with embarrassment and unease. Although, these are crucial digestive processes that integral to our daily lives, perhaps because they deal with waste, they are not commonly talked about. If these processes are functioning normally, this may not be an issue. But what happens when an individual has difficulties with voiding in a way that is considered socially inappropriate when they are unable to control the release of urine or feces past an age appropriate limit or if they void in inappropriate places causing distress at school or at home. Individuals Exhibiting these behaviors maybe suffering from one of the elimination disorders, a grouping of disorders codified and defined in the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders or DSM-5. These disorders are grouped together due to their shared traits of voiding urine or feces in inappropriate places. In children when these elimination processes are perhaps at their most embarrassing. These disorders can lead to shame and ridicule from their peers, though they maybe no less distressing to adolescents and adults. 

00:01:30
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:01:30
DSM-5 

00:01:35
SEAN HARRIGAN There are a few distinct elimination disorders, each given its own diagnostic code. These codes crosswalk to the codes used by the World Health Organization in the international classification of diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorder is linked to the coding system from ICD-9 with codes from ICD-10 parenthesis. For example, Enuresis is assigned a code 307.6 from ICD-9 and (F98.0) in parenthesis from ICD-10. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10 was released in the fall of 2015 in the United States, although, it was adopted previously, in other countries. However, because ICD-10 is now the standard in the United States, this program will be listing the newer code from ICD-10 first followed by the ICD-9 codes in parenthesis. Sometimes when relevant, we will also delineate the ICD-9 and 10 codes when we mention a disorder from a different grouping of mental disorders. For example, conduct disorder, childhood onset type mentioned later in this program is coded as F91.1 312.81. Part of the F90 to F98 section of ICD-10 on behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. Both enuresis and encopresis are included in ICD-10 under F98, other behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. This section also includes Pica of infancy and childhood, stereotyped movement disorders known as stereotypic movement disorder in DSM-5 and adult onset fluency disorder which is a stutter that develops in adult hood. It is interesting to note that ICD-10 groups the disorders by typical onset rather than by the characteristic of the disorders themselves. Both enuresis and encopresis are more common in childhood and adolescence. But about one percent of cases with these disorders continue into adulthood.

ENURESIS 

00:03:55
enuresis: 

00:03:55
F98.0(307.6) 

00:03:55
Primary 

00:03:55
Enuresis 

00:03:55
SEAN HARRIGAN In individuals over age five, enuresis is a pattern of the elimination of urine into inappropriate places, such as clothes or bedding which is not better explained by epileptic fits, medication effects, substance use effects or a physical abnormality of the urinary tract. Enuresis is indicated when the individual is experiencing impairment or distress due to the episodes or when the episodes occur at least twice weekly within three months. For some individuals, secondary enuresis may develop after establishing self-control but most young children who are diagnosed have never been fully toilet trained. This is called primary enuresis. While enuresis makes children more prone to urinary tract infections, the symptoms persist after treatment of the infection. 

00:04:55
ENURESIS 

00:04:55
SPECIFIERS 

00:05:00
SEAN HARRIGAN the clinician should specify the disorders subtype. The nocturnal only subtype is the most common of the subtypes and usually occurs at night or when sleeping. It is also called monosymptomatic enuresis. Nocturnal enuresis is much more likely when the individual has a parent with the same disorder. This likelihood increases if the patient's father had enuresis. The diurnal only subtype is used when individuals experience enuresis during daytime. The nocturnal and diurnal subtype is for individuals who experience enuresis both during the day and while sleeping. 

00:05:40
ENCOPRESIS 

00:05:45
SEAN HARRIGAN In individuals over age four, Encopresis is the repeated elimination of feces into unsuitable places, such as clothing or the floor. The voiding maybe intentional, if the individual has normal bowel control or uncontrollable, if the individual is dealing with physical, psychological or other issues. However, Encopresis is only diagnosed when the inappropriate voiding is the primary condition rather than a symptom of another condition or medication. Encopresis is specified when these events occur at least once per month for three months. 

00:06:20
ENCOPRESIS 

00:06:20
SPECIFIERS 

00:06:25
SEAN HARRIGAN There are two optional specifiers for Encopresis. With constipation and overflow incontinence, indicates that the individual is experiencing constipation that results in involuntary elimination. Individuals may experience constipation for a variety of reasons. Such as anxiety about using a particular restroom, general oppositional behavior, straining while contracting, rather than relaxing or dehydration. The clinician may also specify the diagnosis by indicating without constipation and overflow incontinence. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Yes, thank you for taking my call, uh… my little boy just turned six and he's still defecating in random areas, not, not in the bathroom and, I just wanted to call you guys and see if I need to make an appointment or if you could refer me to someone who, who knows how to take care of this. 

00:07:25
SEAN HARRIGAN Children with Encopresis often experience emotional distress about their condition. This maybe caused or exacerbated by the child's peers or caregivers. Shame may result in anxiety about situations in which Encopresis may lead to embarrassment such as in school or sleepovers. Fecal smearing is possible either on the body or on the surrounding environment. This maybe a child attempt to clean up involuntary passed feces or it maybe a deliberate action. When Encopresis is deliberate, the child may also show signs of conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder. 

00:08:05
OTHER SPECIFIED ELIMINATION DISORDER 

00:08:10
SEAN HARRIGAN There is also the option to diagnose other specified elimination disorder for those instances in which the patient does not meet all of the characteristics for either enuresis or Encopresis but the clinician is able to indicate the reason they do not qualify. With this diagnosis, the clinician must specify whether the patient is experiencing urinary or fecal symptoms. 

00:08:35
UNSPECIFIED ELIMINATION DISORDER 

00:08:40
SEAN HARRIGAN Additionally there is a code for unspecified elimination disorder. This is used when the clinician is unable to specify why the patient doesn't meet the symptoms of one of the other elimination disorders which may happen in the emergency room or can be indicated with situations with limited information in order to diagnose. Again, the clinician must code according to which symptoms the patient is showing. 

00:09:05

00:09:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Diagnosing elimination disorders can offer the patient a first step in the treatment process. One that can help them better understand their symptoms. And perhaps put them on the path to a happier less stressful life.
