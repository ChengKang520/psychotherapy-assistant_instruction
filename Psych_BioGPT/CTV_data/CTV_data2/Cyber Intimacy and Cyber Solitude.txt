SHERRY TURKLE So, I'm gonna begin with a story, um, I came to M.I.T. in 1978. I came there to teach I had just finished a book on Jacques Lacan and why the French had not accepted, uh, psychoanalysis. There wasn't even a standard edition of Freud in France in the 1960s. And I took that to be a kind of puzzle, about why there was a standard edition of Freud in all the other languages and why the French were so resistant until the 1960s, and at, at, until really after the student movement of '68 and the early 70s, um, in the form of Lacanian Psychoanalysis and I took that as a kind of intellectual history puzzle and I went there to study it, and wrote a book. And M.I.T. hired me really to teach the Sociology of Science and, um, the story of how really in my first days on the job I became so struck by the love affair that my students were having with these new computers. The kind of relationships that people were having with their computers to a point that it made me kind of drop what I was doing and spend really my, the three decades there enmeshed in the growing story of people and technology is the story of my career but I, I bring you back to the kind of 1978 in order to say that there I was, in order to tell you this story. There I was at M.I.T. just beginning my odyssey, very, at the very beginning of my odyssey and M.I.T. was very gracious when I told them that I really wanted to study them. Um, I'd been hired to do something else but I really wanted to study them and right away they said sure, fine. Um, which has really allowed me to do my work they've been very gracious. I've been kind of a participant observer at my own institution and I was invited to a meeting in 1978, that I want to tell you about. It was hosted by Michael Dertouzos, who was the then Director of the laboratory for Computer Science. And you know M.I.T. is an urban campus so when we want to have retreats we go someplace else and we go to Endicott House, which is this beautiful, uh, suburban, uh, uh, country setting for three days. The, the luminaries of computer science and artificial intelligence, really the greatest, some of the greatest computer scientist in the world; Lickleider, Minsky, Fano, Dertouzos were off in the country with me really there as an observer, um, and the question was the new home computers and they were called home computers. The word personal computers hadn't yet reached the lexicon. These were the first computers that you didn't have to build, you could buy, 1978. They were on the market and the question was what could we do with these home computers? How could we keep them busy? And I looked at my notes, I always keep notes, I looked at my notes on this meeting. Tax preparation? Maybe. Word processing, big objections because no one thought that anyone except academics would want to write on computers, I mean, what was to write. Somebody suggested a calendar and was told this was a dumb idea. Everybody had little things from the Coop, the Harvard Coop, the M.I.T. Coop gave out these little black books, they seemed perfect. Somebody suggested, um, uh, to put your like your names and addresses and I don't have the name of the computer scientist who said that unless you had a database who would need a computer for that. You know, who had enough names and addresses that you'd need a database? Um, people agreed that there would be games.

SHERRY TURKLE So, everybody tried there were no objections to the exercise people stayed for two days and five meals, I mean, I, I tell this story to make a point. I tell this story to make a point. Um, this, this was long ago, this was long ago, but it was not in ancient days. Um, not that long ago, not that long ago there really weren't a lot of ideas about how we might keep computers busy. But once computers connected us to each other. Once we became tethered to the network we really didn't need to keep computers busy, they keep us busy, they keep us busy, they keep us very, busy. It is as though we are their killer app. So, my story about computers and people, which is really the story of three decades of tracking this story. Not about what computers do for us, not about the instrumental computer, but about the subjective computer because, after all, I am a therapist. My background is psychology, my training is about the subjective side, about people, not about machines, not the computer that does things for us but that does things to us as people, to our relationships, to our way of looking at the world. That story has a narrative arc and it goes from a certain optimism, where I began seeing the computer, the one-on-one of the, in my first book, Second Self, the one-on-one of person and computer. Where I saw a new place for projection of self onto machine in the 1980s. My second book, Life on the Screen, was about the way in which people projected self into the new spaces on the internet, experimenting with identity. Those first America Online chat rooms, virtual worlds, this new, I wanted psychologists to wake up to these new exciting places where people were really experimenting with aspects of self, trying out things that they didn't have space for or courage for in the rest of their life. To now where I'm concerned, and in a way I've been criticized in reviews of this book for that concern. A little bit like, you were on the cover of Wired magazine. What's the matter now? You know, you were dating the internet, now you're not, now you're concerned. And what I'm going to be talking to you today about is really some of the causes of those concerns and where I think therapists, you know, have a role in thinking through some of the causes of those concerns, my concerns cause I think you're seeing them, I know you're seeing them in your consulting rooms, as well. And essentially, here is the crux of what happened and what I didn't see. You know, what I didn't see in 1995 that I see now, that I saw. But what I didn't see before 1995, when I was still so optimistic, that I see now, that I saw then and that I've been essentially studying for the past 15 years. And what I saw in 1995 that I hadn't seen before was when I met a group of young men, because they were just young men at the time and then they recruited some women, who called themselves the Cyborgs at M.I.T.. And these were young men who wore computers on their bodies, they wore computers on their backpack, they wore the web on their bodies. They wore computer backpacks they had keyboards in their pockets. Their glasses were screens, they what el-, they had little antenna. Some people thought they were disabled, so that they were sort of treated differently. But what they had in all this equipment it was very ungainly and it was very; they essentially had this, that I brought up here as a timing device. They had this, with all this stuff they had nothing more than I have right here. They could be on the web at any time. And I'd like to say to my students who were so mad at me that I somehow now am a little more pessimistic, I have caveats, I have concerns. In 1995, I was so optimistic. I say, call me not prescient, call me not prescient, before 1994-95, I didn't see that we would have a device. Call, you know, everybody thinks I'm prescient. Call me not prescient, I didn't see that we would have a device where at any moment of the day or night, because we are sleeping with these devices. How many people here sleep with their cell phone? OK, under eight-, well the people under 18 sleep with their cell phone I interview them hundreds and hundreds of interviews. They tell me this is because it's an alarm clock, but then, little bit later in the interview they say it's not true. It's that they want to, it, they, you know, it's, it's that they call it. It's like a phantom limb. Um, it is so much a part of us, people feel more secure. They want to text in the middle of the night. They want to know, they just want it, they just want it. So, what we have is that any hour of the text or night, um, we can escape from where we are and who we're with to be someplace else. And in fact we are doing that; we're on our e-mail, games, virtual worlds, social networks. We're texting each other at family dinners and now I'm not speaking from casual observation or this is my opinion of social life today. I'm speaking from 15 years of, of sort of, being on the case, cause that's what happened in '95 when I had that insight. I decided that I didn't want to study early adopters, I was gonna track this for the next 15 years. I was gonna see where that went because I realized that I'd been wrong in some of my feelings about what this identity exploration would look like. Because again, call me not prescient, I somehow thought this identity exploration would be; people would do it in the morning. A little bit like Marx, you know, they'd be fishermen in the morning and intellectuals in the afternoon. You know, that they would do this identity exploration at their computers in the morning. Then they would lead their life in the real. Then they would have lunch with their families. Then they would do a bit more identity exploration on the computer. I mean, that it would be a segregated activity. And in fact what we have is people having breakfast with everybody out and the family texting and doing their e-mail. Um, they're jogging and they're texting, we're driving and we're texting. We're pushing our children with swings on the park, we're texting. I've done a big study of funerals, people texting. The children I interview, uh, tell me that their parents are reading them Harry Potter with the left hand and under the blankets they're texting, uh, with the right hand. Um, the guys the young men in particular tell me stories, uh, that their fathers, you know, used to on Sunday, uh, you know, watch TV sports with them and maybe have a newspaper and talk to them in between plays or during, during commercial breaks. You know, that kind of bonding time and now when you have a Blackberry, the father has a Blackberry there and is in the Blackberry zone and it's kind of uninterrupted. And we're not going to have questions during this session but for those of you who are gonna ta-, ta-, talk to me later and say hey you know what's the difference. You know, what's the difference between having a newspaper and you know, doing e-mail? It's really, they're not, it's different because the kind of attention we give our devices the way in which have a kind of Vulcan mind-meld with these devices is not the same as the kind of attention sharing that you used to do with a newspaper. I'm doing a study now of breastfeeding, and it's not just breastfeeding, it's bottle-feeding when women are doing e-mail. Again, that's not the same as watching television or doing the dishes or talking to a friend or reading a book. Because the kind of attention, the stiffening of the body when you get a bad e-mail. You know, that, and which of course the baby associates as having to do with the relationship is not the same. 

00:13:25
SHERRY TURKLE Bad? Extra microphones for me? Do I need them? Back-up microphone. OK. Um, then everybody can hear me I have back-up microphones. OK. 

00:13:40
SHERRY TURKLE Um, um, the point is, is that we, that, that these are the things that I didn't see. These were the things the, the people at Endicott House didn't see as ways in which computers would keep us busy. Um, I talk to teenagers who tell me that when they come out of school, uh, many of their parents actually are divorced and they come out of school and they, or sports practice, and they go out and they w-, they would never want to tell you but that's the moment when they want eye contact with the parent who's come to pick them up in the car. That's the moment when the parent is doing e-mail and goes like this. Just let me do one more e-mail. You know, before, before the parent will even look up at them. Um, and now it is these teenagers turn and as I was saying they tell me they sleep with their phone, they sleep with their phones. And they tell me that even when their phones are put away, relegated let's say to a school locker, uh, they know when they have a message, uh, or a call. Indeed for adults as well as teens when we misplace our mobile devices we become anxious, we become impossible, people feel their phones vibrating, even when they are not on them. It's called the phantom ring. Mobile technology has become like a phantom limb it is so much a part of us. So, I called my first book, The Second Self. Now, we are talking about a new state of the self, itself. Technology proposes itself as the architect of our intimacies, it proposes itself as the architect of our intimacies and these days there is no coyness about its aspiration to substitute a life on the screen for the other kind. So, for example and I find this very, poignant and I'm gonna make a big deal about this. The advertising for Second Life, which is a virtual world where you get to build an avatar, a house, a family and a social life says, quote, 'Finally', 'Finally'. How many of you have seen Second Life or know what Second Life is? And I just want to describe it, it's basically a place where you create an avatar, a lot, most of them look like Angelina Jolie, if you're a woman. You know, you create an avatar, you build a house, you have stuff, you, you and then you there's an economy you can, you spend money you buy stuff but it's a place where you can go and have another social life, you can have a sexual life, you can have a romantic life. The point is, it is one of many, many places on the internet where you can sort of be another you. But the, the point I wanna make about it is what the advertising says about it, because I think it's just the beginning. "Finally a place to love your body, love your friends, love your life." The implication being that this first life is not finally the place to love your body, love your friends, and love your life. And I think that is a very, important piece of the social network. Because there too we're given an opportunity to create the profile, the performance and we slave over these performances and over these profiles. There too it's finally to create the social life, the social network, the way of presenting ourselves that we like perhaps better than what we have in the rest of life. And people talk about the RL not as real life but the rest of life. So, on the network a lot of people as represented by their avatars and profiles and their status updates are richer than they are in first life and a lot younger, thinner and better dressed. Technology is seductive when it's affordances, and I like this formulation I use it in my work it's a technical formulation but I think it's correct. Affordances in the sense of what it offers, technology is seductive or most seductive when it's affordances meet our human vulnerabilities. And it turns out that as human beings we are very vulnerable indeed. And here's where a lot of the formulations from psychoanalysis, from psychodynamic therapy really come in and help us. We're lonely but fearful of intimacy constant connectivity offers the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We can't get enough of each other if, if we can have each other at a distance in amounts we can control. It's kind of like Goldilocks, not too close, not too far, just right, connection made to measure. The illusion of control, the illusion of something that you could have in the world of efficiency, in the world of work perhaps, in the area of our intimacies. To paraphrase Thoreau, where do we live and what do we live for in our new tethered lives? What do we have, now that we have what we say, we have what we want, now that we have what technology makes easy. For one thing we have a technology that enables distraction from what we say we care about. It is not unusual in interviews with me and I should say my methodology is only interviews, no Skype. Face to face interviews, very conservative methodology; I have to be with you, you have to be sitting with me, no telephone, no Skype, no, no internet meetings, no be with me in Second Life, be with me in a chat room. I appreciated that when, that when Rich wanted to interview me for the Networker. I said, well let's talk by phone, send me some questions. He says, no I'm coming to your office and I said, I like him, you know. I mean, you know, it's like he did to me what I did to, to others, you know, and I went. I mean, that's what I do, I that's my method, I have to be with people. So, it's not, it's not unusual for people who I'm talking to in that way who complain to me that they're too busy communicating to think, they are too busy communicating to create, and in a final paradox they are too busy communicating to fully connect with the people who matter. In continual contact with each other, we're alone together. That's where I got the name of the book. It wasn't from the air. We're, we're all the time communicating, people say they spend up to 90% of their, not therapists perhaps because you're kind of forced to shut up and listen. But people like with regular jobs, I mean they spend, they say studies show up to 90% of their time just doing their e-mail. There are programs like Freedom where you pay to disenable your wi-fi because people simply can't do anything if they're online all the time. And yet that is, I mean, we're talking more about that. I mean, about where I think this is going because this can't go on. Productivity is falling people are, in a sense my optimism, I end Alone Together on a curious note of optimism considering the story I tell because I think that people are not happy and not being constructive and creative and I think it's not gonna go on. So, I mean, I, I think something is gonna, something is gonna give. OK, so that's one thing that we have the technology that enables distraction. For another, second, we have the technology that makes it easy to hide. We can communicate when we wish and we can disengage at will. We can choose not to see or hear our interlocutors. Online we put forth the self we wanna be. Otherwise put we would rather text than talk. And this goes across the generations, grown-ups wanna talk, teenagers don't wanna talk for very different reasons but basically people don't wanna talk. So, let me give you an example of a teenager not wanting to talk and then we go to a grown-up not wanting to talk and the differences are striking. So, here's Mandy(ph), 13, tells me I hate the phone and I never listen to voice mail. She says a telephone conversation is almost always too prying, it takes too long and it's impossible to say goodbye. A lot of anxiety about ending the conversation, you could be insulting somebody to end a conversation. I hear this from grown-ups all the time. Sort of, but in, um, young people a lot of anxiety about losing the skill of ending a conversation. A 16-year-old says when you text you have more time to think about what you're writing; on the telephone too much might show. That's, very, very common, grown-ups say a lot, a lot about that too, too much might show. Grown-ups are also very concerned about if I talk to somebody, they might want to talk to me about, like a problem, it could go on forever. So, again I just want to point out what used to be considered good if you have the time. Hi. What's up? Tell me. Is now it's too much because we're thinking about our time as something that we're multitasking. The scre-, the stream of data that is coming in, you know, while we're doing other things. It's not the time to talk about bad news, troubling things, real things, problems, children, illness, death. People tell me they don't wanna, like, put a bad thing on Facebook. People don't wanna talk about a dog who's died they're certainly not gonna talk about a real problem. We're not using the phone, we're not leaving the space for these kinds of conversations. People don't want to leave the space in, in the phone. So, it's not a teen problem. In corporations, among friends, within academic departments people admit to me that they'd rather leave a voice mail or send an e-mail than talk face-to-face. They tell me they use their technology to avoid this voice communication and they say they want to avoid the real time commitment of a phone call. So, here they're using technology to dial down human contact to titrate it's nature and extent. They are comforted by being in touch with a lot of people. Rich wasn't kidding about the 10,000 friends, a lot of people whom they also keep at bay. There's that Goldilocks effect. Dan, a law professor, in his mid-50s, I wanted to talk to you about a grown-up example, explains to me that he never interrupts his colleagues at work, he does not call, he doesn't ask to see them, he says, they might be working, they might be doing something, it might be a bad time. I ask him if this behavior is new. He says, oh yes, we used to hang out. It was nice. He reconciles his views that what was once collegial is now 'interruption' by saying people are busier now. But then he pauses and he corrects himself and he says I'm not being completely honest here. It's also that I don't want to talk to people now. I don't want to be interrupted, I think I should want to, it would be nice but it's easier to deal with people on my Blackberry. We become entrained in a vicious circle that does not go according to plan. We imagine that e-mail and texting will give us more control over our time and emotional exposure. But we send out a lot and get even more back so many in fact that the idea of communicating with anything but staccato texts seems too exhausting. Shakespeare might have said, we are consumed with that which we were nourished by. As we ramp up the volume and velocity of communication we are overwhelmed across the generations. We measure success by calls made, e-mails answered, texts replied to, garbage. We start, contacts reached. I made a Freudian slip and I said garbage because I was thinking of the many interviews in which people talk about their e-mail as I've got to get rid of my e-mail and I associate it to people talking about their e-mail as garbage. I mean, that was you saw me making a Freudian slip. I used the word garbage. People repeatedly talking about their e-mail I've got to get rid of it. It, it, they talk about it as though it's, it, as refuse and so you saw me make that slip I used the word garbage, and it was kind of interesting. I mean, I'm only a person. I mean, what is it that, that, that the, that my association because in front of me I have transcripts and I'm deciding what to read to you, transcripts to read to you. That my association to looking at the language of the people I'm interviewing is that they're t-, when they're talking about their messages they're talking about garbage. How many can I get rid of? How many can I throw away? How many can I get rid of? How many can I get rid of today? Talking about our communications with each other. How many can I get through? How many can I trash? How many can I toss? I mean, this is how, we don't talk to each other on the phone we have this instead. We have a garbage pail on our desk, on our desktop I mean. So, I used the word garbage, I mean, it's interesting. But fortunately I have 3,500 therapists in the audience to talk to me about it. Um, so there's a paradox, I mean, there's a paradox in the garbage and there's a paradox that we insist that our world is increasingly complex yet we've created a communications culture that has decreased the time available for us to sit and think uninterrupted and we communicate with each other in ways that ask for almost instantaneous response. We don't, um, allow ourselves the space to explain complicated problems. It's true in our personal life and it's true in business. One of the things that's so tied together. My interviews both with people and businesses and people who are just looking at their lives in the personal context is the problems seem the same. That the ramp up in volume and velocity if I don't answer my email in a few hours people will say to me. You don't answer your e-mail? So, um, I personally find that if I'm answering all day I mean I have disenabled the part of my phone that gets e-mail all day because I can't be ans-. How many people answer e-mail all day? Well, you know, good, for you. But I, I'm built so that I, I, I can't. I don't get anything done if I do that, but perhaps you, too. I mean, different people are different but I find if really I'm answering e-mail all day I, I, I can't think any I can't think I can't just clear my head and think. So, I do a lot of e-mail, a lot of e-mail. I'm willing to spend many, many hours in the morning and many, many hours in the evening but then I have to have my day where I'm just not. So, I pay a price in the rage of my friends and colleagues and it looks to them like I'm not responding because culturally now we are used to something else. But, but the point I wanted to, the point I wanted to get to here is that when you ramp up the volume and velocity and you're expecting basically, I mean I'm still on a 24- hour, 48-hour cycle we start to ask each other questions that can be answered within a 24 to 48 hour cycle. It used to be you'd get a letter and what a week to 10 days, I mean. You'd think about the contents, you'd think about your answer. If you know that you need an answer immediately because you're expecting it for your job, for your psyche, to, to be able to throw that e-mail in the garbage to get rid of it cause you have 2,000 e-mails in your in-box. You're starting to ask questions that can get an instantaneous answer. You're starting to dumb down the questions. You're starting to dumb down the answers as though we're all putting each other on cable news. It's like, it's like the norm as so there's a paradox in the culture because we're saying that our world is more complicated and we're putting ourselves in this information culture where we're asking and answering simpler questions. So, I said that we now live a new state of the self itself so in, in kind of a set, a set of concluding remarks I want to turn to this more intimate territory, to this more therapeutic terrain. Um, and begin with how our new connectivity changes the terms of how a new generation comes into adulthood. I'm gonna be giving a workshop later in, um, in only a few minutes actually. So, um, which is gonna focus on the teenage years but I wanna just mention it here because really it's in the teenage years that this all begins and where this whole new state of the self itself is born. So, I would be remiss in not, you know, hitting some high points of it, um, here because that's where this new state of the self itself begins. So, today's young people grow up with the fantasy that in some way and I, it may sound that I exaggerate a little but, not so much. Um, that in some way they will never have to be alone. Adult, adolescents still have the job of separation but it can be worked through in smaller steps. If 15 years ago or when 15 years ago someone came to my office or to my consulting room and said I'm in contact with my mother 15 times a day. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:33:45
SHERRY TURKLE I was liberally trained, but I was thinking separation issues. My surveys of, I know you're from all over the world, my surveys from the Cambridge/Boston scene suggest that 15 times a day contact with a parent is no longer an exotic, um, thing. Now in Alone Together I'm very careful because I try to say that just because something has become the norm and I think that this is something that therapists really need to address together. Just because something has become the norm does not mean that it doesn't still carry the trace of what made us once find it problematic. That is to say it may be easy, possible, technologically nothing, we're texting all the time. Hi Mom. Yes. Great shoes, they're only $20 I'm buying them. Yeah, you know. If you're sending 6,000 texts a week; 15 to your mother a day is like nothing. You know, between the shoes, the money, the thing, the bank account, duh, duh, ta, duh, ta, duh. 15, it's nothing compared to what you texted your roommate 100 times a day and you're living with her. Right? So, but 15 texts a day to your mother still may carry the trace of what once made it problematic even if it is the norm. Which has to do with what is separation in adolescence and does adolescence now involve separation the way it once did? So, that's one thing, secondly I'll call it I share, therefore I am. Adolescents move from a situation that is, I have a feeling, I want to make a call; to I want to have a feeling, I need to send a text. This is very important, if you remember one thing from my remarks it would be, it would be important for me that this is what you leave thinking about. I have a feeling, I want to make a call; to I want to have a feeling, I need to send a text. In other words the constitution of a feeling by texting it by sharing it, sharing the feeling becomes part of the constitution of the feeling. Obviously, I don't have time to get into, you know, all of the implications of this but, you know, think David Riesman, The Lonely Crowd, talking about outer directed people just taking it to a higher power. Think Kohut, think talking about people as part objects where the fragile narcissist itself relies on other people just to feel that it's kind of there. Um, it's not a healthy way to develop and need other people. Um, more than this what is not being cultivated is the ability to be alone, to gather oneself. You know, there is a great psychological truth; if you don't teach our children to be alone they'll only know how to be lonely. Having gotten into the habit of constant connection we risk losing our capacity for the kind of solitude that energizes and restores. Finally, I want to end with a plea to not use the metaphor of addiction in talking about all of this. It is so tempting, of course, we now know that the brain gives a little shot of dopamine every time you multitask. So, that multitasking where in fact performance degrades for every task you multitask makes you feel like a master of the universe because you are being rewarded for doing worse. That is the psychological truth so, I could not be more sympathetic to the army of psychologists who use the metaphor of addiction to describe this whole complex of what's going on. But to end addiction you have to discard the substance there's only one path ahead for Charlie Sheen. 

00:38:40

00:38:45
SHERRY TURKLE And we know that we are not going to get rid of the internet. We are not going to get rid of social networking. We're not gonna go cold turkey we're not gonna forbid cell phones to our children. These technologies are our current partners in the human adventure, the notion of addiction with it's one solution that we know we're not gonna take; makes us feel hopeless and passive. We will find new paths but a first step will surely not be to consider ourselves passive victims of a bad substance. But to acknowledge that in our use of network technology we have incurred some costs that we don't want to pay. Then we will be open to repair, moving forward and repair again. What does that sound like? That sounds like the ethic of psychotherapy. We're not in trouble because of our inventions but because we sometimes allow ourselves to think that they will solve everything. That social networking will solve everything. That game playing will solve everything. This is our vulnerability to two simple notions of the technological fix. What we need and I stand really together here with Rich, absolutely is we need new and better conversations. We're not gonna find a solution or a simple answer but we can not assume that the life the technology makes easy is how we want to live. And my final point, we are at a moment of opportunity because every technology provides us with the opportunity to ask. Does it serve our human purposes? Which is the question that causes us to actually reconsider what these purposes are. Thank you.
