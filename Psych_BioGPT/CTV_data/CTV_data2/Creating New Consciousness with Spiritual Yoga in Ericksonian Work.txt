Creating New Consciousness with Spiritual Yoga in Ericksonian Work 

00:00:20
Kathryn Rossi, PhD and Ernest Rossi, PhD 

00:00:30
KATHRYN ROSSI Well, hello and welcome. I conceive of this time together that you're actually in my home office. And in the background, you could hear the waves of the Pacific Ocean because we live halfway between Los Angels and San Francisco on the coast, in the central coast of California. The air is really, really clean and clear and we're out in nature everyday. And it's a really beautiful place to be. The newspaper did an article on our home and they called it, "The Create Retreat for the Mind." Which I think is really flattering. I couldn't have said it better myself. So I'm inviting all of you today for a creative retreat in your mind. Uh… isn't that a breath of fresh air? And so the name of this session is "Creating New Consciousness with Spiritual Yoga in Ericksonian Work." A new consciousness is what we build on a daily and hourly basis. And how exciting is that, that you're literally stimulating your, your mind and body in your gene expression to become new on a daily and hourly basis? And that's actually the truth, that's not a myth. By spirituality, I mean that you are a spirit. There's something about you that's incredibly special. And so I welcome you to, to embrace that. So spirituality is really the expression of yourself and who you are and what you care about. So there can be a spirituality that's in a religious form. And I encourage all of those, organized religion. There can be a spirituality, is that, is that deep internal growth on the inside of you. So the educational objectives are to state that… Oops, that's for damn short. Let's try mine. No, wait, that's not mine. Umm… Name three narrative yoga techniques utilizing Ericksonian mind-body work. So they are basically, that I'm going to tell you a story and a weird, weird story, a weird Hindu stories, they are so great because they are so odd and no one knows them. We're going to learn. Anyone who wants to participate? We're gonna learn how to do physical postures that express this story, which is really awesome. And in that, you're gonna seek the greatest comfort that you've ever had with your body. Another words, no one is going to hurt themselves. We're gonna make that agreement right now. And then the psycho drama that you get to experience with yourself or you create your own story. So those are examples of the three narratives. And, and also… It says to list three ericksonion naturalistic techniques. So, I'm gonna leave a lot of that to your imagination. If you go to the website and the handouts, you'll see that there is something that I called Ericksonian informs. And some of them you'll say, "Oh, yes, observation, utilization." But there is a whole bunch more. And so it would be kind of fun to look at that later and to determine what really interest you in Ericksonian forms. And now you'll see a lot of them demonstrated today with Ernest and I. And of course, we welcome Dr. Erickson into the room. If you don't already have your hand puppet, your finger puppet, that is going to benefit 100% of the proceeds, go to the Erickson Museum. I encourage you to get one, they couldn't be more fun. So I wonder, would you like to come up? What I thought that we would do is literally show you how Ernie and I work in our office at home. And, so, you know, briefly… I ask this beautiful woman who had an amazing experience yesterday. And she was really active right now. If she was in the moment right now of something that was really important to her, to come to terms with. And would you like to say a few words about what's actively going on? 

00:05:20
CATHERINE Sure! Is this working? Yeah. 

00:05:20
KATHRYN ROSSI I think, it's okay. 

00:05:25
CATHERINE Okay, so Kathryn asked me what… If something was active for me and umm… it couldn't have been an a better word because uh… I feel very, very active moment in my life. And uh… coming out of almost a sleeping mode, an automatic kind of a sleep mode to a very awake and aware mode. So umm… that's sort of where I am and I'm from Brazil and I'm also away from home and gonna be going back home and taking all of this with me. And uh… I'm just curious about how things are gonna unravel and how uh… the new things that I'm feeling and experiencing and aware of how they're gonna sort of come into play into my life now. 

00:06:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Okay, so, so Catherine is in this amazing life transition right now. Imagine that, going from being asleep to being awake. And naturally I don't know what that is, I don't know what that means for her, but you can see if you're, if you're close enough you can see that there's a sheen on her forehead. You know, a sheen of uh… Well, let's call it a glow, because women don't sweat, do we? She's active, she's not kidding, and she's taking a look at, really waking up to your whole new life and whatever that's gonna be. So there is a yoga sequence that I particularly like. And I wonder if you would like to learn about it, it's called, it's about " The Eagle and the Sun." 

00:07:20
CATHERINE Sure, I love this. 

00:07:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Okay. So there's a lot of new beginnings in the Hindu literature, in the mythology. And this is the story of "The Eagle and the Sun." And "The Eagle and the Sun," they where originally brothers and their mother gave a birth to these eggs and she, she sat on them and she was just really wanting them to grow and grow and grow. And she was so curious about, you know, she just couldn't wait for her babies to be born. She was so excited. So she began kind of pecking out and worrying at this one egg. And then finally "Oops," you know, she, she broke the egg and out comes the Sun. And the Son is really mad, because the Sun isn't fully formed, the Sun only know, knew how to come up to the dawn, but couldn't go any further. And said to his mother, "are you kidding me? You know, I gonna have to learn this all on my own. You didn't get me fully developed. And so he worked every day to try to get his light up, every day try to get his light up. In the meantime, his brother, the Eagle, got to come to full term. And so he comes out he's huge, big golden body comes up, the red body golden crown, and he's just like, he's just style and he's got everything going on. He's fully formed. In the meantime, the Sun is having to work really hard to mature. So one day Eagle's flying around Garuda, and he says "Man, it's hot." And he looks down and he sees the Earth is parched, the rivers are drying up. I mean, it's bad, it's really bad. So he flies up to his brother, the Sun, he says, bro, he said, you know, back off a little bit, it's too hot. And the Sun says, "No, I'm gonna make things come and make things go. That's what I'm gonna to have make things grow." And he said, "Look, look, no, no." So the Eagle's just all right. He extends his wings, any shades, this, he shades his brother, and his brother is behind him saying "I'm not listening, I'm gonna get hotter and hotter, da-da-da-da-da." And the Eagles going, "Okay, I'm just gonna stand here. I'm just gonna stand here. And then after a while, the eagle looked down, and he saw "oh, its green." Everybody's flourishing again. Isn't this wonderful? And so he brings his wings back and he turns to his brother and he says "Look down, what you see?" And he's, you know, the Sun looks down and says, "Wow!" it actually, it looks better. You know, it looks like things were thriving now. Wow! You were right. I really needed to take a break. I was trying too hard. And that's the story of the "Eagle and the Sun." Should you like to learn the movements for it? Now everybody is welcome to join. And uh… and I encourage, you know, like use the back of your chairs if you need to. This is the standing posture. You can use your mirror neurons and just watch. You could sit in the chair and imitate. There's all kinds of ways that you could go about doing this. And that's a good idea. 

00:10:40
CATHERINE It's kind of hurt… 

00:10:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Oh, check out those socks. 

00:10:45
[sil.] 

00:10:50
CATHERINE Should I keep it on? 

00:10:50
KATHRYN ROSSI So the first move uh… 

00:10:50
CATHERINE Should I keep the microphone? 

00:10:55
KATHRYN ROSSI Sure! So the first move of this is called the "Directional Pose." Because don't you first need direction before you're starting to do something? And so we learn the Directional Pose yesterday. And that pose is that you're really balancing on one foot. This is not an easy pose. And you lean forward as one leg goes back and you reach your arms forward. And the secret to this one, is the farther you move forward, the easier it is, its counter intuitive. Go ahead, try. There, isn't that wonderful? See, you don't even need me. So that's the first one, the directional pose. Yes, everybody's good? Okay, so that's the first one. First you have direction, and next you become an eagle and that's were you wrap one leg around the other. If you really good, your toes come to the other side. I'm not. You could have one foot on the ground if you need that balance and then you make your arms like this. 

00:12:05
CATHERINE It's the right hand? 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN It's left hand. 

00:12:05
KATHRYN ROSSI Oh, it's, let's… No, you have to correct the first one. 

00:12:05
CATHERINE Okay. 

00:12:10
KATHRYN ROSSI So what it is, is this leg is up and this arm is closer to the leg that's up. Okay? And then what do you do after you've been flying high in the sky? After you've been really making your stage two experiences? Well, then Eagle's gonna need to rest on the tree. Now the ideal tree, you're like, way to heck up here. Umm… But, you know, we all do our own thing, right? And the fourth part of the posture is, you bring your foot down and you stand on your mountain. So now let's do it on the other side but we'll do it one after the other. So on the other side, you're gonna move forward, the directional pose. You're gonna go into the Eagle. See, I'm challenging you guys. Well done. And then you go into your tree. Maybe it's a big tree. Maybe it's cactus. It's a tree and then you stand down on to your mountain. So now, Catherine, I'm gonna turn to you. So I, focus on the inside about what's really coming up for you. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:40
KATHRYN ROSSI And it's lovely. Catherine has her eyes closed spontaneously, that's lovely. You'll do with your eyes what you want to this entire time. And so if you will please, come into that directional pose. And if that there… Are you really clear on the direction? You don't have to be. 

00:14:05
CATHERINE Let's see, I don't know. 

00:14:05
KATHRYN ROSSI And it's beautiful what she says is, I don't know. I don't know is one of my favorite places to be. And you can see I'm gently helping her. This is very appropriate. You can actually do this in your office. This is appropriate touching. Now would you like to be an eagle? 

00:14:25
CATHERINE Yes. 

00:14:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Would you like to see if you can get that big oversight? 

00:14:30
CATHERINE Oh, I would love to. 

00:14:30
KATHRYN ROSSI Okay. So as you like, you go into the eagle. And if you need me to steady you, I'm right here. 

00:14:40
CATHERINE This way? 

00:14:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Uh… like that. 

00:14:40
CATHERINE Sorry, okay. 

00:14:45
KATHRYN ROSSI Okay, and you know, and do this and bend down, little deeper. See I'm, I'm purposely making it a little harder for you. Yeah? Try it again, because you know, isn't that fabulous? Because she's so good, but it's in finding that place. Yes! So stage two of the creative process is when you're really looking at what's coming up for you. You're experiencing it. 

00:15:25
[sil.] 

00:15:30
KATHRYN ROSSI I'm gonna talk with the audience for just a moment. You can't see it because only, only I can see it. But the, the nature of her eyes are really changing. They're becoming, you know, there's, there's like a glassiness to her eyes. So I'm gonna be sharing with the audience some of the things that I see and some of the things I observe. So now be a tree. During this tree… Oh, my God, you can really look down. You can see everything. It's so clear. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes, I'm watching her make micro moment adjustments of, into comfort in her body and just watched her shoulders relax. And so without trying, I'm not interested in a perfect posture. She however happens to have one in this. I'm interested to know that she's safe. I'm interested to know that she is stable and comfortable in her body. Yes? So when you stand on your mountain, and you can feel your feet on the ground, do you feel a solidness there? 

00:17:00
CATHERINE I do. 

00:17:05
KATHRYN ROSSI Can you feel yourself from head and from toes, up through your legs and your hips, and all the way up? 

00:17:10
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:17:15
KATHRYN ROSSI Wonderful! We got to do the other side now. 

00:17:15
CATHERINE Okay. 

00:17:15
KATHRYN ROSSI And the beauty of yoga is, you got two sides. Hence, you will always get to do it again. So now you select the other side for your directional pose, that's the toughest part which was the other side. 

00:17:30
CATHERINE Yeah, which one did I do? 

00:17:30
KATHRYN ROSSI Let me see. I think uh… umm… Oh, you did that one. 

00:17:35
CATHERINE I did this one? 

00:17:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Yeah. Okay. Yes. This is the directional pose. This is actually for people that were with me earlier, this is Warrior III. This is actually the pose where you're letting go. And the direction of her eyes… I'm purposely keeping her here for a while. And the direction of her eyes is exactly where the ancient people say it should be, without me telling her. And if you observe her breath, it's gotten deeper. And when you're ready, maybe you want to be an eagle, maybe you want to find yourself in flight. And you take your time. That's right! 

00:18:30
CATHERINE Now which foot did I do? 

00:18:30
KATHRYN ROSSI The other right. 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:18:45
CATHERINE Like this? 

00:18:45
KATHRYN ROSSI Like. There you go. Uh-huh… And if you want to lift up more, and if you want to sink down a little bit more. I'll just be behind you and studying you if I need to. 

00:19:00
CATHERINE Okay. 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:15
KATHRYN ROSSI I can tell you the surprising thing is, most people don't need to be steadied, they just need to know that you will. Again, I'm gonna speak to the audience. For any of you here, you can see her eyes, and you can see how she's really looking inward. She's not looking outward. She's gone deeper. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:55
KATHRYN ROSSI And… Come to your tree, that's mirror me. 

00:20:00
CATHERINE Okay. 

00:20:00
KATHRYN ROSSI Well done. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:15
KATHRYN ROSSI And whatever tree you want to be. Yes. 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:30
KATHRYN ROSSI It's part of the fun. It's just part of the fun. 

00:20:35
[sil.] 

00:20:40
KATHRYN ROSSI I wish I had a camera to take a picture of your changing eyes, it changed so fast. These fully alive eyes that you have and now if you come down to your mountain and face… 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:15
KATHRYN ROSSI And you continue to go deeper there. I'm going to speak with the audience. I should tell you that my dream in therapy, my dream since I was a very beginning therapist, is how could you have therapy with this few words as possible? Because I've noticed that words are the last to come. And most of our therapy, we're asked explain things. We're asked to talk about things that we don't know yet. One of the first things that she said, when I said, okay, you're in the directional pose, "are you confident in your direction and do you know what it is?" And she said truthfully, I'm not sure. In that moment she didn't have the words. She might not even have the words today. It's not important to have the words. It's important to come to terms with where you're going, how you're feeling. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Her breathing is completely expressive. And so the minimal cues that I really look for is, I'm looking for breathing first, I'm looking for the changes in breathing. I'm looking also for changes in skin coloration. There's a lot of beads of perspiration right up here, on her. And so this very gentle woman is right now working really, really hard. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:15
KATHRYN ROSSI Erikson taught us to look at the whole person, to not just look at their face but to look at the whole person. And so I'm looking this, like fantastic stability going on inside of her. And there's a forward motion here. I don't know what it means. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:55
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Again, as I speak to the audience, she's doing about eight second inhales and eight second exhales. On average, people have three second inhales, three second exhales. Some of the profound Yogis can have a three minutes inhale, and a three minutes exhale. 

00:24:55
[sil.] 

00:25:00
KATHRYN ROSSI And also as I speak to the audience, you can see, she's doing fine on her own. She doesn't need me to be brilliant with words. She's in her body. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:26:05
KATHRYN ROSSI Again, I speak to the audience and there's actually, there's dripping coming down here. 

00:26:15
[sil.] 

00:27:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes, experiencing that as deeply… 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:40
KATHRYN ROSSI This is about 20 years ago that uh… a journalist interviewed Ernie. And Ernie was so excited, and he said, "And you know, people can come in, and I don't even need to know what their problem is. I reck they ever even need to hear it." They didn't write the article. It's contrary to what you really think in the field of psychology. If she has something that she wants to tell us, she will. 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:45
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes, receiving what you need to receive. And what you need to receive to take you further. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:00
KATHRYN ROSSI Namaste. 

00:29:00
CATHERINE Namaste! 

00:29:05
KATHRYN ROSSI Nama means bow. Te, is to you. The S holds the two words together. So Namaste is I bow to the beauty of you. Some people call it the divine. But if you really want to be formal, and if you want to say it, where it is as deep as you can say, as you say namaskara, that is the deepest, deepest respect. And so I say it to you with the deep respect namaskara. 

00:29:35
CATHERINE Namaskara. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:45
KATHRYN ROSSI Would you like to sit where Ernie is sitting right now? And, Ernie, you can take this chair. 

00:29:50
[sil.] 

00:29:55
CATHERINE Can I grab some tissues? 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:05
CATHERINE I sweat a lot, you can tell. 

00:30:10
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes, her microphones kind of low but she just said, "I sweat a lot, you can tell. 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:25
KATHRYN ROSSI And so… rather than say anything right now about your experience, I really prefer that you keep it private. Knowing, you could always say "Oh, but wait." I want to share this or I want to share that. But what I'd like to ask you is that, if there's something further that you want to explore, that's really important in the moment. Will your eyes more or less closed by themselves? 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:15
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. So there really is something more important. I have to move my chair up little bit so I can see her, I hope you don't mind. 

00:31:20
ERNEST ROSSI I noticed how, this was not a direct suggestion. It was what, I like to call an implied directive. If something within you would like to experience something further, well, those eyes closed more or less by themselves. So it's not the client… obeying my command, rather I'm offering an opportunity for something within her, not her ego, not her conscious choice, but will something within you close those eyes all by themselves. I give it to her autonomous creative process. Do you see how I placed a burden of choices? Erikson called it on some inner process that the client is just as curious about as a therapist. This is not your all time influence communication, suggestion. No, this is implied work. That means something is going on an unconscious level. And in my recent research, I see, it goes onto the physiological, to the DNA, and even the quantum delicacy, that all of our consciousness and cognition depends upon. 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:25
ERNEST ROSSI That's right, simply continuing… and letting yourself receive, what naturally wants to come, be received. 

00:33:40
[sil.] 

00:33:45
ERNEST ROSSI Again, do you see how I place the choice? She's a (inaudible )of transformation. And I'm asking her simply receive it. If I'm doing anything, a word is, I'm asking her to observe because one deep principle is, any time we can observe something we can automatically operate on it. That's the observer operator. Even in quantum physics, objective multi-million dollar machines, we find that conscious observation modulates a quantum, which means something very small but something very influential, that's now called the exciton, just like the word excitement. And we're looking to open up space for that exciton to operate all by itself. Because after all, who are we with our conscious attitudes? How much do we know about which molecule is going where and which gene it's being expressed? We know that our consciousness and cognition is modulating our gene expression, which modulates our brain plasticity, which modulates new consciousness. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:45
ERNEST ROSSI So we simply… And when Catherine makes this little motion, she's signaling me that she sees vibrations happening in her closed eyelids, vibrations that aren't conscious but more like REM, Rapid Eye Movements when we're asleep. 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:10
ERNEST ROSSI And just like at sleep, at times we dream, and those dreams are very delicate, glass mirror. What Erickson called very gingerly, very delicate processes, you don't want be a bold in China shop and tell the client "Do this, and then do that," rather you want the client become very sensitive to the nuances. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:55
ERNEST ROSSI Yeah! So continuing just as you are, entirely privately. And that notion of privacy is fundamentally important. For it was a genius, and yes, he invented free association, and yes, wonderful, we learn a lot of cycle dynamics. But now we've had 100 years of psychoanalytical and what's it all about? Well, dealing with the resistance by asking the client who, you know, tell their deepest, darkest secrets. You're activating resistances and making it harder for that very delicate exploratory quantum dynamic process to take place. So we make no demands, and we demand, we make is like noise. And noise, of course, just destroys quantum coherence. The quantum level modulating the molecular level, that modulates the DNA, and genes, and brain plasticity and new consciousness. 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:35
ERNEST ROSSI That's right. And those who are close, that you notice that very slight, I'm exaggerating as here. Almost as if some inner process is saying, I don't know but it could be saying, yes, or I understand, or, but it wasn't a motion like this. I can't say no perhaps. So there's a… Yes, Catherine is noticing and signaling to me. Is she, I'm exaggerating, looking over, getting an overview, that very subtle, taking it, taking it all in. We don't know, these are only hypotheses. But by the way she's listening to me and she's wondering too. Is she doing these possibilities? 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:00
ERNEST ROSSI So I'd say, implicit heuristic, an unconscious prompting to stimulate, to turn on those excitons. There are energy communication on the level of DNA and quantum shifts, very delicate. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:35
ERNEST ROSSI Did you notice that subtly deeper breath? You're close enough, did you happen to notice? You go, yeah. 

00:40:45
[sil.] 

00:40:50
ERNEST ROSSI Did you notice that double intakes, she just did? Yes, you're observing very carefully. Dr. Erickson was very gentle with me. But sometimes, even he would get impatient with me. So he'd be talking, working with the client, and then almost and I'm tending the tape recording, you know. Then all of a sudden, I noticed that he's shake wagging his head. And he was quite paralyzed but he was wagging and he said, look at him, and he's got a severe look on his face. He catches my eye. And he makes some motion something like this. 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:40
ERNEST ROSSI Look at the patient, you damn fool, stop looking all around, what you're looking all around like that? He never called me a damn fool. It's my imagination. My father called me a damn fool. Not, he's very gentle.

00:42:00
ERNEST ROSSI Did you notice that the deeper breath that time? See, how fast you're learning. And so of course, she hears me what I'm saying. So on one level she was experiencing and in level, another level, she's observing what sort of Rossi doing. So I'm facilitating a dialogue between her observer mind and her experiencing mind. I don't know what the dialogues about. I don't know what her… If she's got a problem or she's got, who knows what? But I do know, I want to facilitate a dialogue, an interaction between the observing part of her mind and the experiencing part of the mind that often needs help. 

00:43:00
[sil.] 

00:43:05
ERNEST ROSSI Did you notice any wreck suggestion I just gave her? Can the observer, that only you can really observe all the secrets are… So only you can really make these observations. I, the therapist sense, I'm helpless, but I connected her observer with her self-help processes. And this is what we call the observer operator. That's what I'm facilitating and I talk about her watching, taking a look at, and I know the part of her are really delicate, glass mirror, very empathetic, very self compassionate. Have I just given her a series of suggestions to be delicate, self-compassionate? So the guys are giving education to the audience. I'm of course beaming in-direct suggestions to her, but I'm not asking her to do them. I'm not commanding her or… The observer operator, here's what I'm saying. And if I'm saying anything appropriate for her condition, it's operating on her. You know, in hypnosis, we call ourselves operators. I'm not the operator, but there is a very nuanced and sensitive operator within her. And when that observer finds there's an empathy or connection between what I'm saying to the audience and what she's experiencing, that it goes into work. Observe, click, yes, to… so, you see, you never give us a direct suggestion. 

00:45:10
[sil.] 

00:45:25
ERNEST ROSSI And what Catherine is mimicking is all subtle movements that she sees, and she's communicating them to me. So she helps me to be with the audience and let me know also what's happening with the client. 

00:45:40
[sil.] 

00:45:55
ERNEST ROSSI That's right. She's just a moment ago lifted her head slightly. And I said, that's right, because we often overlook this way, about being very sensitive. We make… there's paleontology, anthropology, mind-studies, might that ancient people want to build their homes and eventually their castles on the hill, because they want to look around and see the environment webs or an opposite army coming. If they could see the opposite army coming from 50 miles away, well, they could do a lot of prep for the forthcoming battle. I put a question on that, I said battle. But I looked at her. Yeah, that's a suggestion but it's cost-free. It's failed, see. Maybe there is a battle going on her but I don't say. I like to have a review, all internal battles in yourself. And I could be, well of. So it's always feels safe. It's always an offer. Erickson used the word proffer, P-R-O-F-F-E-R. So finally one day, I looked in the dictionary, what the heck does proffer mean. It means the same thing, else offer. Would it work obsequiously more gentle way? 

00:47:55
[sil.] 

00:48:00
ERNEST ROSSI I don't know if she's experiencing that peace, that path of all human understanding? 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:15
ERNEST ROSSI Do you see if I profess that, with I don't know. When I worked with a perfect client, I'll often say, I don't know if you're such-and-such-and-such-and-such. Well, those who are proffers, are you experiencing something passing human? And Catherina is signaling to me what her body responds like… Hey… Yes, this is extreme. And she telling me that, shut up you damn fool, you're bothering me. I often recognize, I have to shut up, except when I'm in front of the audience, and I lose it. 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:20
ERNEST ROSSI As a matter of fact I don't even know… I leave a blank for her to fill in what this idiot Rossi's trying to say, "He doesn't know." But he… That's right, I acknowledge I'm an idiot, but I mentioned I don't know. And of course, anything I applied to myself, she's automatically gonna apply to her. Are you aware of that mirror neuron concept? You do something, mention something casually and, any suggestion you might want to offer somebody. Oh, my gosh, it better bring something nice because you're also offering it to yourself. Yeah, tell that to the terrorists. I'm sorry, I mention that. 

00:50:25
[sil.] 

00:50:30
ERNEST ROSSI So Catherine is signaling stage one, stage two, stage three, and she shaking. She thinks our subjects in stage two, because she's seeing subtle, nodding, softening's, mini smiles. And now she's signaling definitely, it's definitely a stage three, with us. Yes, the loveliness of a stage three smile. I suppose we were in a Gala, Art Gallery, you know. There were expensive ancient pictures of dignified people. Can you see this? We see things like this, several things. Did you see that more satisfied, deeper? 

00:51:40
[sil.] 

00:51:45
ERNEST ROSSI So what are you trying to tell me about time, Catherine? 

00:51:55
[sil.] 

00:52:05
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. So I like our subject to continue for another few moments. Knowing that our session is gonna have to stop within about five minutes. And what will be like for her to come back to the room? We'll see stretch first or her eyes open first, or will she take an extra minute privately for herself, to quickly overview whatever values this experience might have for her. And of course, keep all that private, although sometimes people want to share a word or two or a sentence that might be appropriate to be shared for, to this audience. Yeah, just to contribute to our education, we don't know if she can help us but she can just be. What is this? May, you have to stop meeting this way. What's your first name? 

00:53:35
CATHERINE Katya. 

00:53:40
ERNEST ROSSI Daliya? 

00:53:40
CATHERINE Katya. 

00:53:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Katya. 

00:53:40
ERNEST ROSSI Kalja 

00:53:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Take like might my name. If you think of Katherine this is, in… You can call her Katherine because probably you could remember that easier. 

00:53:50
ERNEST ROSSI Katya. 

00:53:55
CATHERINE My name comes from that. It's same root. 

00:54:00
KATHRYN ROSSI Same root. So we could be twins. 

00:54:00
ERNEST ROSSI I have light deafness obviously you can say. Tell me, would you like to share any words or is it silence the best comforter for you at this moment? 

00:54:15
[sil.] 

00:54:20
ERNEST ROSSI Do you notice how I said that? Always silence the most comfort for your benefit, another implicit processing, (inaudible ). Your comfort is important, more important than anything else. That is a truth, right? You notice I never lie. But do I lie, Kathryn? 

00:54:40
KATHRYN ROSSI No, not at all but hand me this. 

00:54:50
CATHERINE I'm feeling very comfortable. 

00:54:55
ERNEST ROSSI On the scale of 1 to 10 or… What 10 would be the most comfortable bliss out? 5 is like average? 0 would be just ordinary? Where are you, what number? 

00:55:10
CATHERINE I would say a 10. 10. 

00:55:15
KATHRYN ROSSI 10? 

00:55:15
ERNEST ROSSI 10! Wow. 

00:55:15
KATHRYN ROSSI Come on it's not too far to go from there. 

00:55:20
ERNEST ROSSI You really not saying that just to make us feel good? 

00:55:20
CATHERINE No, I'm not. I was already feeling good after your exercise with the hand, just now, from the last… I had a really nice experience and then I came here and right into this experience. So I'm feeling really grateful and comfortable. 

00:55:45
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Okay, so Kathryn, do you have time things to say or… 

00:55:50
KATHRYN ROSSI Oh, you know, the beauty is, we've got three whole minutes. And you know, it, it really is umm… most important that you stay with your experience. 

00:56:05
ERNEST ROSSI Especially, this kind of, like an experience, obviously a stage three and four. We won't to let our client walkout of the office and remind them. Yeah, this is a state that you're looking for. 

00:56:15
KATHRYN ROSSI But I wonder that umm… if there was anything you wanted to share. 

00:56:25
CATHERINE Umm… well, it was interesting as you were narrating. Umm… I was really feeling the things you were saying. I was, I was completely within myself. But at the same time, I was able to observe and, and be hearing you and following your story. 

00:56:40
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:56:40
CATHERINE And that was really interesting. And umm… 

00:56:45
ERNEST ROSSI She mentioned interesting. Interesting novelty brain plasticity, she just casually mention interesting, nice gold for our work, nice gold. I didn't use the word interesting, she put it in. Wow! 

00:57:05
CATHERINE And I also had the feeling in the other room when we were doing that exercise, and when we were doing the yoga and I was sitting in that posture and sitting here. And I've been feeling that lately is like this, and you're talking about electromagnetic energy and all the things and I really feel like this energy emanating lately, whenever I'm in that mode of being in myself and observing at the same time. So it's kind of even makes me shake sometimes. It's very strong. 

00:57:40
ERNEST ROSSI So you see, see the confirmation of the observer, experience her, that she's comfortable with. Had you ever worked well, that way before the observer and experienced her? 

00:57:50
CATHERINE I have been in the last two months a lot. Yeah! 

00:57:50
ERNEST ROSSI All right. 

00:57:50
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:57:50
ERNEST ROSSI So you're prone with some of this? 

00:57:55
CATHERINE Yeah, I would say I'm a pro but I'm enjoying it, I'm learning it. 

00:58:00
ERNEST ROSSI Okay, so this is how yoga apparently outer action, it's really correlated with inner optimization. 

00:58:10
CATHERINE Actually that's something else… I mean, I went to you, your workshop yesterday because I practiced yoga and I had, I've been practicing Ashtanga for, on and off, for like 13 years, but on and off. And I had been off until I came here about two months ago for the, the training umm… here at the foundation. And spontaneously in the hotel, I woke up at like 4:30 in the morning and my body was just like, okay, let's do it. And I just put a towel on the floor and started doing yoga again. And, and it's just interesting, all these things are tying together. And the yoga with the Ericksonian hypnosis and uh… other things in, in my life and everything just sort of coming together, and it's just really special to, to experience that this week. 

00:58:55
ERNEST ROSSI That's wonderful body language. You know, I want to study it. Yeah, she's speaking with her hands as well as words and poetry. 

00:59:05
KATHRYN ROSSI Well, we are now at that perfect time to say thank you so much to everyone for being here. You were a part of Koch's therapy, a very special part. When you do work in front of the group like this, there's some way that you go really deep. And so I want to thank you all for being here. And I wish you the happiest day. And we shall say "Let's see in, in Brazil, and Portuguese, how do you say, so long or goodbye." 

00:59:45
[non-English narration] 

00:59:50
CATHERINE Thank you so much.
