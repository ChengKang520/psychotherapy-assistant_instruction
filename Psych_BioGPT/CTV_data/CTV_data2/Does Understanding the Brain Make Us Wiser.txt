RICH So, uh, before Dan Siegel came on the scene, the vast majority of psychotherapists thought something like what does all that gray, mushy stuff inside people's head have to do with therapy anyway? Not only was brain talk an impossibly dense polysyllabic foreign language that only a science nerd could love, but it clearly had no bearing on people's thoughts, feelings, memories, perceptions, expectations, the real stuff of therapy. Dan Siegel has almost single-handedly changed that. I can still-, the first, the first time we invited him to address this meeting almost ten years ago. I had just met him only a few months before, although it almost immediately seemed like I had known him forever. And I wasn't at all sure how an expert on brain science was going to go over with this crowd, containing so many of us who had become talk therapists in the first place because we were terrified of the prospect of taking organic chemistry. Of course, I had already learned that Dan was one of those authentic, deeply kind people who it is impossible not to like and immediately trust forever. In fact, I began my introduction that year by confessing that I had already formed a telephonic soul bond with him. Uh, at the time I said, it was love at first interview. And I confessed to a hotel full of psychotherapists. But then I felt moved to share a startling a-ha moment I had had with Dan and admitted the real reason I had invited Dan to speak at the symposium. I recall exactly when it occurred. He was uh, trying to explain some basic brain process and I got lost somewhere between the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. So realizing my confusion, he had me hold up my hand and make a fist, and proceeded to make brain physiology understandable to me for the first time. And I got it. And I said to myself, this guy is the Senor Wences of brain science. If I can get this guy to come to the symposium I'll be the Ed Sullivan of neuroscience. So I promise you a really big show this morning, a neuroscientist who talks like a human being. 

00:02:50

00:02:50
RICH Now, this is about wisdom, this conference, so I have some wisdom and I was looking back. It was clear I got the Ed Sullivan analogy right, but it had nothing to do with introducing Senor Wences. I didn't know it at the time, but I was about to bring on the closest thing to all four Beatles rolled up into one to that unsuspecting symposium audience. The rest, as they say, is show biz history. More than any person in the mental health field, Dan has expanded our vision of just how social the brain is, how each of our individual brains is really always in the process of experiencing, integrating, changing and being changed primarily by other people's brains. Sometimes listening to Dan, I imagine us all, every human being on Earth, sharing one vast, flowing, pulsating social brain as if we were all connected by an intricate network of axons and dendrites extending around the planet, and maybe beyond. Over the years it's become clear that Dan's modest ambition is to change the world with his work on parenting, on mind psych, how people connect and become attuned to each other, on educational policy, on psychotherapy. Dan has used his study of interpersonal neurobiology to help us as individuals, parents, teachers, therapists and as a whole society acquire a greater capacity for reflection, emotional resilience, flexibility, connection and, dare I say it, genuine wisdom. I highly recommend to you the latest installment in his quest to make these ideas accessible to all of us, his just published book, "Pocketbook Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology." And the second extensively revised and updated edition of his classic, "The Developing Mind." He'll be doing a book signing and all those at lunch time, and those books are at the uhm, outside the Diplomat foyer. So it is fitting that at this conference on creating a new wisdom that Dan can be our concluding keynote speaker, address the question, "Does understanding the brain make us wiser?" So here he is, the fifth Beatle himself, Dan Siegel.

00:05:35
DAN SIEGEL Good morning. Good morning. Uhm, that was such a funny introduction. Uhm, thank you, Rich. Before we get started, I just want to take a moment and uhm, really thank Rich for 35 years of really creating a community.

00:06:00
DAN SIEGEL It's, it's a beautiful contribution you're making to the world, Rich. And thank you, thank you very much. Uhm, it's also as Rich was saying, we've known each other for about ten years now, and uhm, I feel like this is a, a community where I really belong for the first time, so that means a lot to me. So it's really, really nice to be here. Uhm, so thank you. So this morning, uhm, you know, we're going to talk about does knowing about the brain uh, help us become wiser, which is the assignment Rich gave to me. Uhm, and so we're going to talk a little bit about wisdom, but you know, wisdom happens beneath and before words. So, I was feeling, getting ready to come here that there ought to be something we ought to do together that isn't just uhm, one person sharing words with another, which can be great. Uh, but actually something that went more into primary experience, more something that we could carry with us outside of this room, and really perhaps even deeply be an invitation for transformation, uhm, if that happens like that. So uhm, I was feeling that, and then uh, yesterday morning when Mary Pfeifer spoke, wasn't that an amazing talk? Uhm, you know, I was feeling that uhm, to, to do uh, uh, an effective approach to Mary's invitation, which was to move psychotherapy out of the psychotherapy suite and actually try to really uhm, in an urgent kind of way, participate in helping the planet. Uh, we need to bring our skills of resilience inside of ourselves first and then share that with other people so that the really painful place that we're at now in human evolution is that we've grown so large and we've become so consumeristic that the planet is in grave danger. And so, if you're thinking that you're a psychotherapist, and we'll talk about the psyche in a moment, but that you really want to help bring healing into the world, that it really means that we have to go and become a part of the healing of the whole world, not just the individual in front of us, which is very important. But to do that, we need the strength not to go into denial, not to go into despair, not to go into depression. Uh, and so even though I know the time is short this morning, I'm going to devote uh, a good amount of this morning to an experiential exercise, which I think if we do it together as a community, I think it has a bigger chance of going out in the world uh, and making a positive impact on ourselves individually and ourselves collectively and if we're fortunate, maybe even having a ripple effect out into the larger society. So we're going to do a practice. Uhm, so we'll get ready. So, is you say well, oh my God, Dan's talking so we want to hear about the brain and all that stuff, Rich showed you the books you can read. And I can just tell you that the journey I've been on for ten years has been kind of amazing, joining with Rich and with all of you at the psychotherapy networker community. Uhm, this has been a ten years I never, ever would have predicted. I mean, you know, when I started getting into this it was because I felt like a fraud when I started practicing psychotherapy. I got my board certification and everything and no one ever said what the psyche was. And I as supposed to be a therapist of it. And you probably know, the definition of the psyche is the soul. The spirit, the intellect and the mind. We're therapists of the mind. And yet, we have this peculiar thing where in all the fields that study the mind, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy of mind, education of the mind, even fields that deal with the mental issues like anthropology or sociology. There is absolutely no definition of the mind. It's amazing. And yet here you have the psychotherapy networker, the therapy of the mind networker. So one thing I want to say in terms of wisdom is that this journey for me of trying to understand the brain was really a journey to try to find the mind. And I didn't know when I began this journey that there'd be no discipline that had a definition of it. So we're going to do deeply into some very profound questions about what the mind is. And when we get there, which we're going to do in this brief hour-long keynote I have, or less than an hour, oh my God. Uhm, uh, this is going to be an interesting timing issue. Uhm, because here's what I feel. I feel like we all have a mind. And you're going to experience it right now in this exercise we're going to do. And just because I don't want you to worry, and I know I'm going to forget this, I'm going to give you a teeny bit of scientific background, not, not so that you can be taking notes about it and everything, but so you, in the part of your mind that wants to make sure you hear a lot of science and not just experience something, you're not like freaking out, like, oh boy Rich really screwed up this time. So I'm just going to give you a background, because I, I never do this. And my wife always says, you are like the worst promoter of yourself. And I go, I know, I know. So I wore these cargo pants to show you the pocket guide fits into a pocket. This is my promotion. And next year, we're going to have psychotherapy networker written on the butt of your cargo pants. That will be really in, right. So there it is. So that's my promotion thing. But, but here's the thing. If you want to know the science, first of all, you can join us online. We have a whole Mindsight community where we deal with these issues. If you want to do the exercise we're about to do, and you want to take notes, you don't need to take notes. You can go to my website Drdansiegel.com and you could download it for free. Just come join us and download the thing. So you don't have to be taking notes. I want you to experience what we're about to experience. If your mind says, where's all the data on the brain? This book is a non-linear book that lets you dive into all the stuff we're going to talk about in some very deep and profound ways. If you want all the references, which this has none of, then "The Developing Mind" is your book. If you want like a scientific textbook that defines the mind, finally, there it is, "The Developing Mind." If you want a book that shows you how to develop what we're about to develop in the beginning of it in you, "The Mindful Therapist" would be your book. If you want a book that shows you how to deal with patients, with clients, "The Mindsight Book" would be your book. If you want a book that just looks at mindful awareness, "The Mindful Brain" would be your book. And if you work with parents, the two parenting books, "Parenting from the Inside Out", "The Whole Brain Child," show you actually how to do this exercise with kids. So you can relax that part of your brain that says, Oh, why aren't we hearing all the details? All the details are not available to you, literally, to do that. And then I've overseen the editing of 24 textbooks in this field called interpersonal neurobiology, which is basically a field that combines all of the sciences into one perspective, right? And so all the authors we get to write in that series, some of whom are here, you know, have spent thousands of hours gathering literally tens of thousands of scientific references to support a lot of what I'm about to tell you. And when I revised "The Developing Mind" we had 15 interns whose job was to prove that the first book, the first "Developing Mind" was wrong, that it was totally wrong. And that if they could prove that, then we would just revise it. And luckily I can tell you that most of it was upheld and everything I'm going to tell you now is supported by all this other work. So here's the story, here's the story. What is the mind? We're going to now dive into an experiential exercise that lets you explore it for yourself. And then, we'll finish the exercise and we'll take a guess at what, what happened. 

00:14:55
Mindsight and Neural Integration 

00:14:55
Hub Spoke Rim First Five Senses Sixth Sense Seventh Sense Eighth Sense 

00:14:55
DAN SIEGEL So to do this exercise, we're going to do something which is all about developing this thing called mindsight, which is this capacity to sense something inside of yourselves. We won't define it now, but we'll define it after the exercise and promote something called neural integration, which we'll talk about later. But in a very profound way, when you look at the brain, you'll realize the mind is not the brain and the wisdom for us, as not neurologists, we're not neurotherapists, we're psychotherapists. The mind is not the brain. Now, the mind uses the brain and other things to create itself. And that's a very important experience we're going to have right now. And the way we're going to explore this is something called the Wheel of Awareness. So, this is something I'd like you to take a look at. This is a wheel. It's actually a picture of a table in my office where this uhm, practice got started. Uh, where, those of you who've been to my office know there's a central glass hole around this wooden outside. But anyway, it looks like a wheel so I call it a wheel. And what I did was I would gather clients around this table and I'd say, look, this center hub is the experience of knowing, within awareness. And the outer rim is everything you can know. And we'll divide into four segments. One segment includes the first senses of hearing and sight and smell and taste and touch that bring in the outside world into your awareness. And you do that by sending a spoke of attention to this aspect of the rim. And we'll do a whole practice where we move the spoke over to the next segment of the rim if you look up there, called the Sixth Sense. And the Sixth Sense is how you get a sense of the interior of the body. Then we'll move the spoke over again. We'll explore mental activities like feelings and thoughts, memories, images, things like that. And then we'll even go to an eighth sense. That other sense called the Seventh Sense. And the Eighth Sense is the sense of your connection to other people and the larger environment in which you, you live. And we'll do this and then we'll explore other aspects of this. So to do a practice like this, a reflective practice, it's really helpful to put stuff off your lap, unfold your legs, put your feet flat on the floor. And we just need an agreement. You know, a lot of what happens in life as we get trained to focus on external stimuli, like someone talking, or watching something on television, whatever. So when you do a practice to really find where the mind is, uhm, it actually can get you to become very sleepy. So, because we're a large group of uh, people in the room, we have to have a shared agreement that if you, first of all, if you fall asleep and you don't pay attention to the exercise, that's fine. You can go to the website and do it later on. That's all good. And you can download it on your thing and you're fine. However, if you fall asleep and start snoring, it's not so pleasant for everyone around you. So can we have an agreement that it's okay for a neighbor to lovingly and gently nudge you awake if you've started to snore? Is that, is that okay with everyone? Okay, very good. It's a necessary suggestion, uhm, because it often happens. Okay, the other thing to say is this will be a long practice. I, I really am going to devote the majority of the real estate of my keynote to this practice. I think it's that important. Uhm, so if you have a bad back and can't sit straight, pretty still, for you know, a good half hour, then please come up here and just lie on the floor and you can do this all lying down. If you feel so sleepy that it's hard to stay awake, you can, if your eyes are closed, open your eyes and get some light. And if you, that doesn't work, you can do this entire exercise standing up. Just hold on to something, but you can completely do it standing up. And there's a huge amount of wisdom that will come from just exploring what you're about to explore, whatever you discover. So this is just a map. This wheel is just a map. And just like if I gave you a map to go to Yosemite, uh, you know, and once you get to Yosemite and park, put the map in your pocket. Don't worry about the map. Look at the waterfalls. Explore the forests there. Look for bears and deer. Don't say oh, it's not on the map. It's not here. This is just a map to get you to Yosemite of your mind. Okay. So, with your eyes open, just let you attention come to the middle of the room here. And send your attention back to the far wall. And then let the attention come back to the middle of the room. And then bring attention to about book reading distance, as if you were holding a book in your hands. And notice how you can determine where attention goes. And now what I'd like you to do whether your eyes are open or not is whatever you want to do, let your attention find the breath. And let's start to level the nostrils, where you sense the air coming in and out. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:40
DAN SIEGEL And now let that attention move to the level of the chest as it rises and falls. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:55
DAN SIEGEL And notice too, or you can bring attention down to the level of the abdomen. If you want you can put a hand on your belly. And notice when the air fills the lungs, the abdomen moves outward. And when the air escapes the lungs, the abdomen moves inward. And just let this outward and inward movement of the abdomen fill awareness. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:30
DAN SIEGEL And for now, just let the awareness of the breath, the sensation of the breath fill awareness as you ride the wave of the breath in and out. I'm just going to share with you an ancient story that's been passed down the generations. The mind is like the ocean. And deep beneath the surface of the ocean, it's calm and it's clear. And just sensing the breath brings you to this deep place beneath the surface of the mind where just like in the ocean, when you look to the surface from that deep place of tranquility, you can just notice whatever conditions are there, flat or choppy waves or a full storm. No matter what's going on at the surface of the sea, deep beneath the surface, it's calm and it's clear. And sensing the breath brings you to the deep place beneath the surface of the mind, where from this tranquil place of clarify it's possible to just look at the surface activities of the mind, those brain waves of feelings and thoughts that come and go like waves on the surface of a mental sea. And just sensing the breath brings you to this deep place beneath the surface. And in a similar way, we have the image of the Wheel of Awareness, where the hub of that wheel is like being beneath the surface of the mind. Deep in the hub it's calm and clear, this origin of awareness. And from the hub, it's possible to send a spoke out to somewhere on the surface, which is the rim. And right now, we're going to begin the Wheel of Awareness practice where just sensing the breath brings you to the hub of the mind, this hub of the Wheel of Awareness. And then we let the breath go, just grounded in the hub. And whether you can see it in your mind's eye or just imagine it, imagine that sending a spoke out now from this hub to the first segment of the rim, which brings in the outside world. And let's begin now with a spoke going to this part of the rim, bringing in the sense of hearing. And let's let sound fill awareness. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:30
DAN SIEGEL And now moving the spoke over a bit. Let's turn now to sight, letting light come in through the closed eyelids or opening the eyelids a bit. Let sight fill awareness. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:25:00
DAN SIEGEL And now moving the spoke to the sense of smell, letting odors fill awareness. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:25
DAN SIEGEL And now moving to the sense of taste, letting taste fill awareness. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:45
DAN SIEGEL And now moving the spoke over one more time. This time to the sense of touch, anywhere where skin is touching clothing or the floor, or skin touching skin. Let touch fill awareness. 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:15
DAN SIEGEL And now, I invite you to take a bit of a deeper breath as we let the outside world go and we move the spoke over from this first segment of the rim of the Wheel of Awareness. And we move the spoke now to the next segment, which is the segment that represents the interior of the body. And let's begin with the facial area, with the muscles and bones in the face. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:50
DAN SIEGEL And then moving attention to the top of the head, the scalp, the back of the head. 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:05
DAN SIEGEL And now to the muscles and bones in the neck and throat. 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:20
DAN SIEGEL And now, to the muscles and bones in the shoulders. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:40
DAN SIEGEL And then streaming attention down both arms, down to the elbows, the wrists, and the ends of the fingers. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:28:00
DAN SIEGEL And now bringing attention to the upper back and the chest, and then to the lower back and the abdomen. 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:25
DAN SIEGEL And now bringing attention to the hips. And then stream attention down both legs to the knees, the ankles, the ends of the toes. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:50
DAN SIEGEL And now bringing attention to the pelvic region, to the genitals. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
DAN SIEGEL And to the intestines. 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:15
DAN SIEGEL And now, up in to the interior of the lungs. 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:30
DAN SIEGEL And now centering attention in the heart region. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:45
DAN SIEGEL And now, letting awareness become filled with the interior of the whole of the body. Let the whole of the body fill awareness. 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:10
DAN SIEGEL And knowing that the wisdom of the body is available to you by just inviting these signals from the body up into awareness. I now invite you to take a deeper breath and imagine now moving the spoke over from the second segment of the body now to the third segment of the rim. And this is the segment that represents our mental life of feelings and thoughts, memories, images, hopes, dreams, attitudes, intentions, all the life of the mind. And this part of the rim review will have two components to it. The first component simply goes like this. Resting in the hub of the Wheel of Awareness, sending a spoke out to this part of the rim. Invite any mental activities, feelings, thoughts, images, memories, anything at all. Invite them to enter awareness and just experience what that experience is like. And let's begin that part right now. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:32:40
DAN SIEGEL And now for the second aspect of this part of the rim review, we'll do the same invitation to any mental activities, feelings, thoughts, memories, for them to come into awareness, only this time in addition, what I invite you to do is study the way a mental activity first presents itself to awareness. Is it sudden? Is it gradual? How does that feel for something to first present itself to awareness? And then, once it's presented itself to awareness, how does it stay in awareness? Is it constant? Does it vibrate? Does it undulate? What does it feel like to stay in awareness? And then how does it leave awareness? Is it gradual? Is it sudden? How does it leave? Is it just replaced by another mental activity or if it's not replaced, what is the gap between two mental activities feel like? So for this part of the rim review, I'm inviting to become a student of the architecture of mental life, studying how things present themselves, stay present, and disappear from awareness itself. And let's begin that process right now. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:36:10
DAN SIEGEL And now I invite you to find the breath, and now to take a deeper breath. And we'll let this part of the rim go for now as we imagine moving the spoke over one more time on the rim to our fourth segment of the rim. And this segment represents our sense of connection to other people, other things outside of the bodies in which we live. And let's begin by opening up our senses to the sense of connection to people sitting right next to you in the room, people physically close to you in the room, that sense of connection to those near you. 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:10
DAN SIEGEL And now let that sense of connection expand to all of us sharing this experience together this morning in this room. All of us in this room together right now. 

00:37:25
[sil.] 

00:37:35
DAN SIEGEL And now extending that sense of connection to all therapists, all healers outside of this room. A community of therapists. 

00:37:55
[sil.] 

00:38:00
DAN SIEGEL And now, focus that sense of connection on family and friends outside of this room. 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:20
DAN SIEGEL And then, opening that sense of connection, to all people that you work with. And now to people who live in your neighborhood. 

00:38:40
[sil.] 

00:38:40
DAN SIEGEL People who live in your community. 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:50
DAN SIEGEL And to all people who live in your city. 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:38:55
DAN SIEGEL To people who share your state. 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:05
DAN SIEGEL To people who live in your country. And then see if you can allow that sense of connection to expand to people who live throughout the world, to all of us who share this planet. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
DAN SIEGEL And now letting that sense of connection open up to all living beings who share our common home, this place we call the Earth. 

00:39:50
[sil.] 

00:39:50
DAN SIEGEL And now knowing that science has recently demonstrated what wisdom traditions have known for thousands of years, that sending wishes of kindness and concern, of love and compassion, out from inside of these bodily selves out into the world, not only brings positive changes in the world, but it brings positive physiological changes inside of our own bodies. And with that in mind, I invite you to find that place of love and kindness, of positive regard, of concern. And see if you can send that out to all living beings who share our home on Earth. 

00:40:55
[sil.] 

00:41:10
DAN SIEGEL And now, bringing that sense of compassion and kindness to our own inner experience, I invite you if you'd like to put one hand on your chest and one hand on your abdomen. Put some gentle pressure on your abdomen and chest that way, and just allow yourself to soak in kindness and love toward this inner self. This origin of all these experiences. 

00:41:45
[sil.] 

00:42:00
DAN SIEGEL And knowing that being kind to ourselves is the gateway to being kind and compassionate to others, I invite you now to take a bit of a deeper breath and we'll let this rim review go for now. And in an introductory session, this would be a way to end the Wheel of Awareness practice like this. But we're going to take it one more step. And I want to just let you know that the next step we're doing is, it's a bit of an advanced step and so if you're not up for it, you can just focus on the breath. That's fine. It's very brief, but it's a very powerful one and if you're up for it, let me tell you how it goes and you'll give it a try. You can keep your hand on your chest and your abdomen if you want or let it go, whatever you feel like doing is fine. But for this one, imagine this. Just sensing the breath brings you to the hub of the mind. It's the inner place of tranquility. And this time, you let the breath go and from the hub imagine sending the spoke of attention out from the hub so, you're sending the spoke out, but this time instead of going somewhere on the rim, imagine bending that spoke around. So the spoke of attention goes out from awareness in the hub and bend it around so it turns back and comes back into the hub itself. So you're actually focusing attention from the hub, bending the spoke, and sending attention right into the hub of the mind. And let's do that and experience what awareness of awareness feels like. 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:46:15
DAN SIEGEL And now, I invite you to find the breath, riding the wave of the in breath and the out breath. Knowing you can always come back and explore the Wheel of Awareness in any way that you'd like to learn more about your inner life. I invite you now to take a more intentional and deeper breath. As we let this Wheel of Awareness practice come to a close for today. When you're ready, you can let your eyes gently come open. Feel free to move your body around a little bit to stretch a bit. Welcome back. 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:25
DAN SIEGEL So, if this were uhm, a day long or a three day long event, we, what we would do is take a break, in silence, sometimes go to sleep for the night. Certainly, take an hour just to be quiet. But I decided to do this in a keynote address because the mind is a source of healing. And what you just experienced is an invitation to explore your mental life. And what I'm going to do is take the next, I guess I have about eight minutes left, or something like that? And what? I have 20 minutes? Oh, fantastic. Thanks, Rich. So I'll take the next 20 minutes, and even though this may not be ideal from a experiential point of view, I really would like to give you an hour of silence just to soak that in. But I do think it's worth talking to you about the science of what just happened. Uh, and its possible connection to a way we in the field of psychotherapy can actually take the invitation about going out into society uhm, and changing the course of cultural evolution based on this definition of the mind. So, the Wheel of Awareness practice is just a metaphor. There is no wheel anywhere. It's just a, a diagram that lets you get to some very profound experiences. If we had more than 20 minutes, I would send a microphone around and we would spend as much time as we needed to get everyone's reflections on what that felt like. Now, I done this for thousands of people, so I'm going to give you some reflections that no matter what the culture is, that I'm in around this planet, it's amazing that the experiences, as diverse as they are, are all the same. It's actually startling. And at the center I help run, the Center for Culture, Brain and Development at UCLA, we study the way culture shapes brain connections. And when you find a universal pattern, it's very significant because often culture makes things different. So this finding that it's the same is fascinating. So let me go through with you uhm, a way of thinking about this. And again, if this is something that's interesting to you, please explore the wheel so you have your own first person learning that happens. That's where true wisdom comes from. It's not what someone else is telling you. It's what you know from the inside out. And that's why I chose to use so time of the keynote to actually have you be your own teacher. Because wisdom comes from inside of you, not from what someone else tells you. And this is an invitation to actually develop that wisdom, not just for yourselves, where it should begin, but for all the people you work with, who you can teach about these things. You can teach them the wheel. You can teach them about the learning from the wheel. So let's go through it. Now, I'm going to ask you to put a little bit of your intellectual hat on. But all these ideas are in the pocket guide for sure. They're in "The Developing Mind." 

00:50:50
Mind: A common term in search of a definition 

00:50:50
WHAT CONNECTS RELATIONSHIPS, MIND, AND BODY/BRAIN? MIND (EMBODIED) BRAIN RELATIONSHIPS 

00:50:50
DAN SIEGEL And so it goes like this, we have an interesting, uhm, let's see if I can get rid of this thing. We have an interesting problem in the field of psychotherapy, which is that we are therapists of the mind but we have no definition of the mind. And we don't even have an academic discipline to draw upon that defines what the mind is. This is a serious problem. If you really take the term psychotherapist seriously, this is an identity crisis if you think about it. Now, I don't know why it doesn't bug other people, but it really bugs me to be calling myself something that I have no idea what it is. So, the first thing in terms of wisdom for us in the field is we have a moment in our evolution where we actually can take all the disciplines of science, combine them into one, and from that interpersonal neurobiology approach, which is called consilience, from E.O. Wilson's use of the term. We combine all disciplines into one perspective. That's what we do in interpersonal neurobiology. We basically have a foundational science that draws on all sciences to help our field and then go out and help education, climate change issues, whatever we do, we can come from that very scientific place. So what do we do with this word mind? Well, the first thing is that we have this issue, this fundamental question, you can see on this slide, which basically says to us if you can show the slide that would be super. There we go. Uhm, that in our work, we deal with three aspects of one reality. Yes, we deal with the mind, which we haven't defined yet. But we also deal with the embodied brain, that is, this whole nervous system distributed throughout the whole body. So you can call it the body if you want or embodied brain. And we also deal with relationships. This slide, we could spend three hours on this one slide, but I'm just going to give you the take-home message that when you think deeply about this for about 20 years, you come up with, you come up with the following realizations of this question, What connects relationships, mind and the body/brain? And here's the idea. 

00:53:20
RELATIONSHIPS: SHARING "BRAIN": THE EMBODIED MECHANISM MIND: An EMERGENT, SELF-ORGANIZING PROCESS emerging FROM AND ALSO REGULATING the FLOW OF ENERGY AND INFORMATION within the Body and within our Relationships 

00:53:20
DAN SIEGEL That relationships are the sharing of an essence which is called energy and information. When I communicate with you and we develop a relationship, we're sharing energy and information with each other. All relationships, whatever their nature, are about the sharing of energy and information. Energy is the capacity to do stuff. Information is always based on a swirl of energy that has symbolic value, has a meaning beyond just the swirl of energy. That's what information is. Energy the capacity to do stuff. These are pure scientific terms. Energy is a scientific term. I've been criticized so much, you cannot believe it for evoking the concept of energy. But energy is straight out of physics. And if physics is a hard science, then using energy is a scientifically valid thing to do. But this has created so much anger in people it's fascinating. The brain is the embodied mechanism of energy and information flow. Literally, the brain is simply a mechanism by which electrochemical energy streams through the body. So it's an embodied mechanism. So what's the mind? Now this would again be a three hour talk on this one little bit of this slide, but I'll just give you the take-home points. The mind can be defined, and here it is, of course of having awareness and has subjective experience. And those we can talk about a little bit later. But here's the definition of one aspect of the mind. That it's an emergent self-organizing process that's straight out of mathematics. It emerges from and also regulates, this is the recursive quality, of the mathematics of complex systems. It's called recursivity. That it arises from and also organizes it's a self-organizing part that regulates and here's what we're saying the system is. The flow of energy and information that's both within the body, never calling just the brain, hence within our relationships. This is the key issue. The mind is not just the activity of the brain. The mind is a self-organizing emergent process that arises from and regulates energy and information flow within the body for sure. So it's important and essential to know about the brain, absolutely. But equally important is our relationships, not just with each other in the room, but the relationships we have as a culture, the relationships we have with the planet. That's where the mind is coming from, the regulatory aspect of the mind is located in both your body and your relationships. And this is a scientific consilient view of a way of defining the mind. I thought when I came up with this definition 20 years ago, it would be fun to compare it to the other definitions that were out there. It turned out there are none. There are absolutely none. I have met with the chair people of departments of psychiatry and psychology and philosophy throughout this planet. There are no definitions of the mind. So why shouldn't we as mind therapists, therapists of the mind, the psyche, the soul, the spirit, why shouldn't we actually have a definition of what we do? So I'm offering this to you especially after doing the next edition of "Developing Mind," I feel it even stronger than I did before because now we validate it with thousands of more references. That this is a definition of the mind that we can have, and it's a wise thing to do to define what your field is I think. So what does the mind include? The mind includes awareness, of course, and I don't know if that's part of the self-organizing process. I'm not sure. We're going to explore that in just a second. Subjective experience, the inner texture of what you experience cannot be quantified. So as you probably remember academic psychology dropped that from its purview about 100 years ago. Psychiatry doesn't really deal with it. And scientists will say subjective experience isn't real because you can't measure it. That doesn't make much sense. I was once in a debate about should psychiatrists be taught psychotherapy. And my opponent said because psychotherapy deals will feelings and feelings have no scientific basis in reality, since psychiatrists are medical scientists they shouldn't do a process that's not scientific like psychotherapy. Literally, that's what he said. And he sat down. He said if feelings aren't real why should anyone who's a scientist do psychotherapy? I didn't know what to do. I felt really sad, but I knew feelings weren't real, so it didn't really matter. So I didn't know what to do, you know? So I got up to the podium. I was like a resident in psychiatry and I had no idea what to do. I'd never done public speaking before I got up there. And I said, I don't know one scientific study that has proven that you exist. And I sat down. So science is fine, but it's not the be all and end all by any means. 

00:58:45
Mind includes: Awareness Subjective Experience and an EMBODIED AND RELATIONAL process that regulates the flow of energy and information (Self-Organizing, Emergent Process of both brain and relationships) 

00:58:45
DAN SIEGEL So here's the idea. What I'm proposing is that the mind is an embodied and relational process that regulates the flow of energy and information. You can develop an entire approach to psychotherapy based on the fact that regulation can be trained. You can teach people to monitor with more depth and clarity and stability which is what the Wheel of Awareness does. And then to modify, just like you steer a car, to modify towards something called integration. And then you can, once you start thinking that way, you can realize that integration, the linkage of differentiated parts, when it's present, creates harmony, like a choir singing in harmony. And when integration is not present, it's the mathematics of complex systems. You get chaos or rigidity or both. And then if you go to the DSM, you know what you find? Every symptom of every syndrome is an example or chaos or rigidity or both. And suddenly you go, Oh my God. Health is integration. And the DSM is actually a book that didn't know it, but it was describing conditions of impaired integration. And you can make guesses, as was done in the first edition of "Developing Mind," that disorders of major psychiatric conditions, like schizophrenia or autism or bipolar disorder will be found to be disorders of neural integration. Areas of the brain that link widely separated parts together will be impaired. And then guess what happened? Studies of the brain have advanced. So now we know autism, a disorder of neural integration, schizophrenia, a disorder of integration, bipolar disorder, a disorder of integration, and even for conditions unlike these which are not caused by experience, experientially induced troubles with mental health like abuse and neglect. What are the areas of the brain that are damaged in those conditions? Integrative fibers of the brain. The corpus callosum that connects the left and right hemisphere, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal region that links the whole thing together. So then what we become as therapists is integrationists, where you promote linkage and differentiation in the brain and in relationships, and in the culture. So it's all one big system, this planet is one big system. So I'm going to take the next four minutes, which I have, or maybe a little more and do the following thing. 

01:01:15
Mindfulness & the Plane of Possibility: Varying the Degrees of Certainty Subjective Experience Degree of Probability Peaks of Activation Plateaus of Probability Neural Firing Diversity Open Plane of Possibility 

01:01:15
DAN SIEGEL I've got to do this. This is a diagram that asks the question, If you really are going to sit there and say, and I'll describe this to you, so don't worry. But if you're really going to sit there and say the mind is a self-organizing process that regulates the flow of energy and information, you've got to take it to the point of saying what is the way that you regulate energy. If all information is energy, how do you regulate energy? And this is a really interesting challenge. So this is my proposal to you. Now, put your seat belts on, because this is where we go for the wild ride. Physicists, and I've been able to spend a lot of time with lots of physicists, don't really know what energy is. They know, as a summary concept energy, of course, takes different forms, light energy, electrical energy, chemical energy. That's all fine. But if you say, what is energy itself? It's a capacity. It's a potential. And you say to them, how do you measure energy? You measure it by alterations in what's called a probability distribution. And the probability can go from 100 percent certainty, like I'm clapping my hands now, to zero percent certainty, which is 100 percent possibility, which is you don't know what I'm going to do, just to give you a feeling of that range. So I said okay, got it. Got it. So the way you regulate energy is you alter the probability curve, okay? And if the mind is truly a self-organizing process that's regulating the flow of energy, which sometimes is information. But the flow means a change of something across time. What that means is the mind is a process that alters the probability curve. Does that make sense? It's the only thing we can say about it if you're really going to go down this road. Now, maybe it's all wrong, but I think it's right. So then you can draw a graph, which is what this is a graph of. And you'll find this in "The Mindful Therapist" The Pocket Guide, uhm, those two books. Uhm, they wouldn't let me put in the Mindsight book. They said you're going to scare the public away if you start talking about changes in probability curves. I said but that's what it is. And they said yeah, but we can take this on as a community of practice, if we're really mind therapists. So here's what I want to suggest to you happens. And I'm going to come back here and show you how this relates to the Wheel of Awareness practice. You can, let me see, if I do this can you see the arrow moving around? Yeah. Both sides? Yeah. Good. The way this works is time moves across the X-axis here. So Time One is here, Time Two, you know, as we move across this way. The probability curve changes in certainty from 100 percent certainty, like I'm saying Golden Gate Bridge right now, to zero percent certainty, you have no idea what I'm going to say. And I don't know what I'm going to say. So a mental activity like a thought is the actualization of the probability curve of possibility into actuality. That's what a thought, a feeling, an image, a memory is. It turns possibility into actuality. And the mind does that. Okay? So that's the first thing. That's a peak. But you can also have something, not just a thought but thinking, which would be this sub-peak process right here. That's altering the probabilities, like if I say Golden Gate Bridge, you're more likely to think about the Brooklyn Bridge. So I can prime you in that way. I can also be in an upbeat mood because I'm here with everybody so my mood, which is a plateau, is elevated. So I'm probably going to think about positive things, and exciting things, and fun things. And that's my mood, which would be this plateau. And when you drop down in probability, getting closer and closer to zero, it actually becomes harder to see it, so that things that are most, are furthest away from this plane are easier to see. Like a thought is easier to see than thinking is easier to see than a mode and is easier to see than awareness and a mood. And this open plane is where the probability curve has moved toward zero certainty and the equivalent of that is 100 percent possibility. So here's my suggestion to you. My suggestion to you is that this hub of the Wheel of Awareness is the plane of possibility. And that the continuity in mental experience between awareness, which arises from the hub, which is just a metaphor. This is the mechanism. Is that the curve of probability has gone from complete infinite possibility, and how many of you when you did the awareness of awareness part, felt this expansive sense of openness? Raise your hand. Take a look. Everywhere on this planet, no matter the culture is, no matter what the scientific background, people get a feeling of, how many of you felt like it felt like home, like safety, like grounding, like this openness? Some people call it God. Some people call it the soul. And when this happens in every culture you've got to wonder. And what I think is happening here is the open plane is where awareness arises from. And when you teach people the Wheel of Awareness practice, you're integrating consciousness, because you're differentiating the knowing, which is the hub, I believe knowing and awareness comes from a probability curve at zero percent certainty or 100 percent possibility. I think that's what the phenomenon awareness emerges from. And the amazing thing about it, is you can train people to differentiate this hub, the plane, from plateaus and peaks, which are aspects of the rim. And when you do that, you're basically integrating consciousness. And not only are you doing that, there's a huge amount to talk about, the power of that in psychotherapy. So every client of yours should learn the Wheel of Awareness practice because what it does is it takes the basic form of integration and it allows them to become empowered to change probability distribution. So I've had people come in, massive anxiety problems. Huge anxiety problems. I teach them the wheel, and everything changes. Why? Because they can see the anxiety was just one point on the rim. In the parenting book, "Whole Brain Child," Tina Bryson and I put the Wheel of Awareness practice in for parents to teach to children and schools that are teaching the wheel practice to children have a totally different sense of social-emotional intelligence because this is the basis of that aspect of life. When you teach about how the mind works in yourself and others, everything changes. So the last thing I'm going to say, because I know we need to stop, is the place where we're all differentiated, where I'm different from you and you're different from your neighbor and we're all different from each other, the unique way we bring a self into the world, is through our plateaus and our peaks. And that's beautiful. It's great to have a coherent narrative of yourself. It's great to know where you've been in the past, where you are in the present, where you're going in the future. That's an integrated memory system. It integrates the left and right hemisphere. Integration creates well-being in our personal lives. That's all fantastic. But when you work on these nine domains of integration that we talk about in interpersonal neurobiology, what happens is the following. This open plane of possibility is our commonality. This open plane, when you people to develop the hub of the Wheel of Awareness, is basically the plane. When you teach them to get access to that, they drop beneath the peaks and plateaus of personal isolated identity, where some people just feel very alone and disconnected. It drops them into this place where my plane and your plane and your plane and your plane are the same. And suddenly you get this feeling from the inside out that you are profoundly connected to other people, not just connected, but when you see another person, you realize they're just a manifestation of you, that the self is not a singular noun. The self is a plural verb. And if we embrace that reality by this simple practice, that all of us as therapists can do ourselves and do for other people, if we realize that, you come to realize, first of all, that the planet is all this interconnected whole. And it isn't just something you do because you're supposed to do it, because it's moral imagination. You do it because it is the thing to do, to take care of us. You go from me to we. But the other thing that it does and this is what I'll close with, is this integration of consciousness invites all these domains of integration to become present. And when we embrace the definition of mind like that, that's both embodied and relational for us as therapists, here's the amazing thing. You come to this unbelievable, simple piece. Perhaps it's wisdom, I don't know. It's straight from science. Integration made visible. Integration made visible is kindness and compassion. And so when we bring this integration of consciousness into our lives, and into the lives of others, we are going to bring kindness and compassion into our world. So thank you so much for your attention.

Creating a New Wisdom The art & Science of Optimal Well-Being 

01:12:00
RICH So, there's uhm, one thing as you're leaving and go forth, go to your workshops. We're running a little late but there's time for you to get there. Just the, the one connection between one aspect of this experience that seems is really relevant to this conference is there's that part where Dan was guiding us through the, this hub of awareness. There is that part about experiencing connection and then he kept taking us to wider and wider places, you know, sort of to countries, and the planet. And it became very clear at least to me that that's a highly undeveloped part of my own brain. And the connection with this conference is what's happened for us over these last few days by living in this community for these last few moments, that part of my brain at least feels richer, more integrated perhaps, in Dan's terms, wired. This is, so this, what Dan is saying, I think what Mary was talking about, what we're trying to do at this conference. This need, this kind of survival need to experience this part of our brains, this connected part of our brains really is the task for us as therapists, as citizens of the planet, we have a challenge ahead of us. I hope this conference has helped at least some of us to have a clearer sense of what that mission is. Take care.
