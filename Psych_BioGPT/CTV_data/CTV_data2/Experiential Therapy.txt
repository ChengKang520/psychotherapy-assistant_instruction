BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
 Ah, what I've done is I've asked, what I've done is I've asked for a volunteer who has an issue that she's stuck with and, uhm, the, ah, so I've interviewed briefly in front of the stage a couple of people to see is, ah, if there's something that I can work with and the problem that, ah, is going to be presented, I am going to learn about. I only know the title of it. It has something to do with betrayal and so what, what we're going try to do is to replicate a therapy session. Now, I hope that the audience participation may be there because the best way of doing psychotherapy is when you have one patient in four or 500 psychotherapists let's say. I think that's pretty good odds. Uh-huh, and so I made it very well as for your help in one way or another and, ah, I will be, you know, glad if you, if you can do that. Sometimes there's humor that's involved in therapy but what we try to do also in something I learn from transactional analysis is that there's a gallows humor like somebody could say, "Well, I'm fat but I'm fat and happy. Ha-ha-ha." And it's an attempt to get people to laugh at their conundrum, to get people to laugh at their socks-- stocks pot so I would say let's be careful about that but let's keep that in mind. We want to use humor as it is, ah, appropriate in the situation. So, uhm, I am going to invite, Tana, Tana to come out on stage and, uh-huh. Okay, well, welcome to the privacy of my office. 

00:01:55
TANA Thank you. Wow! 

00:02:00
 And do a sound check 

00:02:00
TANA It's great. 

00:02:00
 Say just a few words. 

00:02:00
TANA Hello. 

00:02:05
 Hello. 

00:02:05
TANA Hello. 

00:02:05
 Ah, somebody will adjust the microphone so that we'll hear to, to other well. Okay, Tana, you and I are meeting for as much as an hour. 

00:02:15
TANA Okay. 

00:02:15
 And at the end of this time, you want to be different in some substantial way. 

00:02:20
TANA Yes. 

00:02:20
 Well, let's say that we are completely successful. 

00:02:25
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:02:30
 How was you be different at the end of the hour? 

00:02:30
TANA Uhm, I would be different in that, uhm, I wouldn't carry around the guilt of, uhm, uhm... 

00:02:50
 Well, let's just stuck you there. 

00:02:50
TANA Okay. 

00:02:50
 Well, it's-- no, it's a little hard - 

00:02:50
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:02:50
 - to get started and it's a difficult situation. 

00:02:55
TANA It is. 

00:02:55
 Yeah, and may - 

00:02:55
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:03:00
 - bring up a little tension. 

00:03:00
TANA It does, yeah. 

00:03:00
 Yeah. So how about if we start by just getting present. 

00:03:05
TANA Okay. 

00:03:05
 Uh-huh, and then we'll come back to that question. 

00:03:10
TANA Okay. 

00:03:10
 And by getting present, you could make yourself comfortable. 

00:03:15
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:03:15
 Maybe, place your hand so that they rest in and that was a good idea, moment in which you could just close your eyes. 

00:03:25
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:03:25
 And then as you close your eyes, it allows you to begin to pay attention. And for example, you could pay attention to the sound of my voice and you could begin to realize something about the tone and tempo of my voice. And for a moment, in a moment, it could feel to you somehow as you sit back easily and know that anytime that you want to you can make any of those adjustments that increase, that really increase your own sense of well being. For example easily, slowly, gently with your eyes closed, you could look up to the top of your head, take an easy breath knowing that as you exhale fully, that's the most complete, the most profound physiological comfort. And that as you listen, with your eyes close to my voice, for a moment-- in a moment it may feel to you is that as if somehow you're pleasant presently incased. Somehow pleasant presently cocooned so that it could seem to you somehow as if my voice was all around you. And as you take this moment presently to attend, to attune to my voice and the tone and the tempo be ease. You could begin to feel your body in the way in which the rhythms of your body begin to slow down and how yes, you give yourself the nod to attend to body of your experience so effortlessly, so easily and you can feel for example-- realize for example your feet are on the floor. You could realize for a moment, you could feel for a moment your arms are resting effortlessly and easily against your sides as soon as that you could feel yourself contained by the comfort of your own arms resting easily against your side. And that you could know something proprioceptive as you could know something about your head being in an upright posture. And that if you wanted to, you could even, you could even feel the freshness of the air. And that could-- there could be a very ple-- pre-- pleasant taste that you could even begin to imagine and that any shapes or colors, any changing patterns that you see before your eyes could help you to feel even, even more. Feel that even more, Tana, yourself. Present-- press-- presently absorbed and that could be a very nice feeling looking at that - 

00:07:45
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:07:50
 - in a very grounded, very present feeling, yes. And then once again, I'm gonna, ah, ask you to effortlessly, easily open your eyes and come back and I'm gonna ask you that question again so just take one or two or three easy breaths and-- a little better? 

00:08:15
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:08:15
 A lot better? 

00:08:15
TANA Yeah. 

00:08:15
 Much better? 

00:08:15
TANA Much better. 

00:08:15
 Much, much better. Very good. Okay, then, this, ah, hour - 

00:08:20
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:08:20
 - this hour becomes remarkably successful, you have accomplished what it is that you've said out for yourself. How would you be different at the end of the hour? 

00:08:35
TANA I will completely love my father. 

00:08:35
 You will completely love your father, this much? 

00:08:40
TANA Yes, in-- infinite. 

00:08:40
 Infinite, okay. Now somehow, there's been something that has gotten in your way so if we were imagining that your father was over there and what you want to do and I'll believe you what you're going to do deep in your heart is to share your love with him. 

00:09:05
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:09:10
 And yet something has come in and been like an eclipse. 

00:09:15
TANA Yeah. 

00:09:15
 And that eclipse is not something that's just visual. 

00:09:20
TANA No. 

00:09:20
 That eclipse has been something that is... 

00:09:25
TANA Yes. 

00:09:25
 So that when you try to meet this goal that you have of-- with your father then... 

00:09:35
TANA Uh-hmm. Yes. 

00:09:40
 Uh-huh. 

00:09:40
TANA The event always comes back. 

00:09:40
 The event comes back. 

00:09:45
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:09:45
 So there was an event that suddenly... 

00:09:45
TANA Yes. 

00:09:50
 Uh-hmm, and that event must have been something that was really deep and really painful. 

00:09:55
TANA Horrible. Yeah. 

00:10:00
 Horrible. And you know this is a public situation - 

00:10:05
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:10:05
 - so I don't-- normally, I would ask but I could see from the moisture that's swelling in your eyes that this is here. 

00:10:15
TANA Yeah. 

00:10:15
 Uh-huh, and so what is your understanding? What is your best understanding of what it would take for you to begin to resonantly - 

00:10:30
TANA Yeah. 

00:10:35
 - ah, be able to do this, to do this, and to be able to this. What do you-- what's your sense of what it would take for you to able to do this with your father? 

00:10:55
TANA Uhm, to be overcome to realization that even though he was perfect in my eyes... 

00:11:00
 He was perfect in your eyes. 

00:11:00
TANA Yes. 

00:11:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:11:05
TANA And he was really good at, uhm, he was a clinical psychologist. 

00:11:10
 Psychologist, uh-huh. 

00:11:10
TANA Uh-hmm, and he was really good at covering - 

00:11:10
 Good at, I'm, I'm, I'm little deaf. 

00:11:15
TANA - that kind of covering his tracks. 

00:11:15
 Covering tracks. 

00:11:15
TANA A little bit so... 

00:11:15
 And, and covering tracks would add to this and this. 

00:11:20
TANA Yeah. Cuz he made me feel like it really happen what I saw. 

00:11:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:11:30
TANA So and because I loved him so much - 

00:11:30
 There's some of mystification. 

00:11:35
TANA - I wanted to believe him but I knew what I heard and seen and - 

00:11:40
 Uh-huh. 

00:11:40
TANA - so. 

00:11:40
 You knew what you heard. You knew what you saw. 

00:11:40
TANA Yeah. 

00:11:40
 And you-- this is your truth. 

00:11:45
TANA That, yes. 

00:11:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:11:45
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:11:45
 And it complicates things when somebody tries to create.. 

00:11:50
TANA Right. 

00:11:55
 But I was trying to view it that - 

00:11:55
TANA Especially like that. 

00:11:55
 - gra-- graphic has, ah, create flack. 

00:12:00
TANA Yes, he did. 

00:12:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:12:00
TANA He was very good at that. 

00:12:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:12:00
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:12:00
 Yeah, and then that makes this even harder. 

00:12:05
TANA Yes. 

00:12:05
 So in order to be able to-- let's-- we're imagining your father or imaging him there in order for you to be able to do this, what is your best sense of what it is that you need to do? Could you summarize it. Like, what would work for me to able to share my love with my father would be, what would be the Reader's Digest sentence? 

00:12:30
TANA It would be for him to acknowledge - 

00:12:30
 Right. 

00:12:30
TANA - what he, what he did - 

00:12:30
 Right 

00:12:30
TANA - and to just embrace me and say, "I messed up. I'm not perfect. I'm sorry I told you not to tell your mom and that you've had to sit with, uhm, sit with that secret for 20 years." 

00:12:50
 Right. Now, is your father attending the conference? 

00:12:50
TANA No, he passed away last year. 

00:12:50
 Yeah, so then the possibility of him saying those things is nonexistent. 

00:12:55
TANA Right. 

00:13:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:13:00
TANA Yeah. 

00:13:05
 And that hurts. 

00:13:05
TANA It does. Yeah. 

00:13:05
 Deeply. You know, I was doing a workshop once, ah, and we need some tissues so some of another volunteers helps by getting some tissues. I know that when I opened up my office in Phoenix, they told me that I needed two chairs and a tissue box and they had the order on. Uh-hmm. Yeah. 

00:13:30
TANA Yeah. 

00:13:30
 I was working, ah, with a women in Canada and, ah, she started to tear, she started to messed up and, ah-- thank you so much. Available to you if you need them. 

00:13:40
TANA Thank you. 

00:13:40
 Uh-hmm. And I, I said to her, if your tears had words - 

00:13:50
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:13:50
 - what would they be saying to you? And she said, "You know, you guys when you get angry, you eject your chin out, you fold your arms, you, you know, thrust your chest." And she said, "Sometimes, we ladies, when we get angry..." 

00:14:05
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:14:10
 So if does tears had words, what would they be saying? 

00:14:20
TANA They'd be saying that I'm mad at you for never stepping up and having that conversation with me. I mean you had all those conversations with your clients and... 

00:14:30
 So then let's put in here, would it be better to put him here in a chair or would you like to imagine as if you were standing there. 

00:14:35
TANA I want him to stand. 

00:14:40
 Chair? 

00:14:40
TANA To stand. 

00:14:40
 To stand. 

00:14:40
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:14:40
 You imagine him standing there. Okay, and say that to him just what you said before. Tell him about your tears. Tell him about being mad. How tall is he? 

00:15:00
TANA He was like 5'10". 

00:15:00
 5'10"? 

00:15:00
TANA Short, yeah. 

00:15:00
 Not so tall, average size. Okay, so... 

00:15:05
TANA Okay, so... 

00:15:05
 Look up at him. 

00:15:05
TANA Uhm, dad, I'm, I'm really angry that you, first of all, that you allowed me to possibly be in the position where I would come home and see somebody else in our house and that you lie to me about it for so long. When I-- and it was so scary for me to even ask you about it I mean when it is you are just so perfect to my eyes. 

00:16:00
[sil.] 

00:16:05
TANA Then, when you denied it, you were so good at lying and I just thought maybe I, I was embarrassed and I was felt disrespectful that even be questioning you. But then all those years, I know it was just, it was uncomfortable and I just wanted to love you again just completely and not have that always in the back of my mind. And I, you know, it might just felt like I was betraying my mom and I just wish that instead of seeing all your clients that you... 

00:16:45
 Are you looking at him? 

00:16:45
TANA Yeah. 

00:16:45
 Yes. 

00:16:45
TANA That would have maybe you schedule an hour for me and just gotten real and just admit it and did it said that it was a mistake and that you love mom which I know you do. And that you were sorry for putting me in that position and... 

00:17:10
 I'm so angry with you for not being worthwhile. 

00:17:10
TANA Yes, that... 

00:17:10
 Tana... 

00:17:15
TANA You're the dad, you're supposed to do that. You were getting great with everybody else. You solved everybody else's problems and helped them work through things. Why can't you take an, an hour and then done that with me? Tell him I'm mad that I wasn't brave enough to confront you on it. Why didn't I, why didn't I do that when you were here? I mean it would've been uncomfortable but now I've got to live the rest of my life just thinking why do you have... 

00:17:55
 Okay. Tana, I'd like you to do something else if you will go along with me on this experiment. 

00:18:00
TANA Okay. 

00:18:00
 Uh-huh. I will-- my daughter is a zinger and, ah, I went to one of her zinging lessons and the teacher was incredible and she had my daughter zinged a note from here, from here, from here, from here. 

00:18:20
TANA Okay. 

00:18:25
 And summarize what you just said but you are saying it from here and say it again to your dad as if you were saying it from here. 

00:18:35
TANA I... 

00:18:40
 You're betrayed, you're disappointed. 

00:18:40
TANA Yeah. 

00:18:45
 That's just a summary but say it from here. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:55
TANA Uhm, dad, I love you so much and I just admire what you do and the person that you are. 

00:19:05
 Just slowdown a little bit. Feel it from here, uh-hmm, and I'm so mad. 

00:19:10
TANA And when that night happened, I'm just so, I'm so mad that you denied it. 

00:19:20
 Feel it from here, I'm so mad that you denied it. 

00:19:25
TANA I was really-- I'm so sad. I'm sad... 

00:19:30
 And I'm mad at myself for not confronting you. 

00:19:30
TANA I'm really mad at myself, especially, you know, you were sick for 10 years. I had 10 years that I could have done that and it was not. I just thought if stop that behind me that and it doesn't work. I didn't work. 

00:19:50
 Okay, Tana, I think I'm gonna ask you to-- I just know it's hard- 

00:19:55
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:19:55
 - and what you're doing is really felt deeply in your heart. 

00:20:00
TANA Yeah. 

00:20:00
 Just free your hands for a moment. 

00:20:05
TANA Okay. 

00:20:05
 Uh-hmm. And say it again and use your hands. You've been restraining yourself. You've been holding back. 

00:20:10
TANA Okay. 

00:20:15
 So say it as if were coming not from here but say it as if it were coming from your hands. 

00:20:20
TANA Okay. I just wanna shake him. 

00:20:25
 Okay, great. 

00:20:25
TANA I'm really mad at you. You were gone at this. You could've sat down one hour and talk to me about this. You could had admit and just-- we could have gone on and how that our good relationship began. I forgive you. I just needed you to ask - 

00:20:45
 And acknowledge. 

00:20:50
TANA - and acknowledge and just be honest. 

00:20:50
 And take responsibility. 

00:20:55
TANA Yes, yes. Be responsible. Yes it happened. You messed up. I get it. 

00:21:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:21:00
TANA Just talk to me about it. 

00:21:05
 And if it's okay, one more time. Is it okay? 

00:21:10
TANA Yeah. 

00:21:10
 Okay, could you do something with your feet? 

00:21:15
TANA Okay. I could kinda wanna kick him little bit. 

00:21:25
 Right, so you're moving your feet before. 

00:21:25
TANA Was it, you know? 

00:21:25
 Yes. 

00:21:25
TANA Yeah. 

00:21:25
 Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:21:30
TANA I've just... 

00:21:30
 So then just-- without words, say it with your hands. Without words, say it with your hands and feet. Same thing. I'm mad at you. 

00:21:40
TANA Okay. 

00:21:40
 I'm mad at me. I wish you would have taken responsibility. I wish you would have spend an hour talking with me about this. I'm mad that I didn't take - 

00:21:50
TANA Yeah. 

00:21:50
 - the time to confront you about this and that we live with all of this for the 10 years. 

00:21:55
TANA Yes, yes. Okay, but no words. 

00:21:55
 Right. 

00:22:00
TANA Uh! 

00:22:00
 Sounds are good. 

00:22:05
TANA Yeah. 

00:22:10
 What was that like? 

00:22:10
TANA I felt pretty good. 

00:22:10
 Really, good. 

00:22:10
TANA Yeah. 

00:22:10
 You felt good in what way? 

00:22:15
TANA Just-- I don't know. Just kind of that, uh, thing that... 

00:22:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
TANA Just letting, just... 

00:22:30
 Okay. 

00:22:30
TANA Missed opportunities. 

00:22:30
 Uh-huh. 

00:22:30
TANA Lots of them. 

00:22:35
 Okay, so now what I'm going to do is to ask you to do something else - 

00:22:35
TANA Okay. 

00:22:35
 - which would be to, to stand out. Uh-huh, please. 

00:22:40
TANA Okay. 

00:22:40
 And to go behind the chair. Uh-huh, and that's great with your hands right there in, in a gentle way. And, you know, we're up close to Disneyland, right. 

00:22:55
TANA Yeah. 

00:22:55
 So, ah, ah, I'm going to, ah, reference in the peculiarities of my own mind, the Disneyland moment. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. 

00:23:05
TANA Okay. 

00:23:10
 Uh-huh, and the bibbidi-bobbidi-boo is what? 

00:23:15
TANA It's the magical, you know... 

00:23:15
 Who does bibbidi-bobbidi-boo? 

00:23:15
TANA The fairy godmother. Yeah. 

00:23:20
 Okay, so, ah, close your eyes for a moment and, ah, hear that resonate phrase bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. 

00:23:25
TANA Uh-huh. 

00:23:30
 As if you're inducing yourself into being a fairy godmother and that you can hear those words bibbidi-bobbidi-boo and that you've been a fairy godmother. You've been a fairy godmother to many people, to friends, to family, to patients, and you have memories of being a fairy godmother and a fairy godmother works on certain principles, three Ps; permission, potency, protection. Then at for a moment, I'd like you to feel essence, feel the spirit, sense, get the felt sense of bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:20
 Got it? 

00:24:25
TANA Uh-huh. 

00:24:25
 Great. And then I'm gonna say something to you and, ah, it's a phrase that I learn from friend, Steven Andrios, and he has done a lot of work with forgiveness as my friend Janis Abrahms Spring has done. And then forgiveness is predicated under an understanding that you won't make the same mistake again. Forgiveness is predicated under an understanding that you won't allow yourself to be hurt again. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:05
 And, and that forgiveness is something that you do not for the other person, this is something you do for you. And as you hold your hands gently, supportively imagine that Tana's sitting there and that you're bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. And that's she's been angry at herself and she's been somewhat unable up until this moment to forgive herself. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
 And through that breath and through those tears and through the support of those hands and through that bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, I'd like you to infuse her with a spirit of forgiveness that she can't forgive herself. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:15
 And the phrase that Dr. Erickson that there's so many kinds of tears that there are tears of rage and there are tears of pain, and tears of shame, and tears of guilt, tears of fear. That there are tears of joy and there are tears of love. And there are the kind of tears that wash away the old hurts. 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:05
 So many different kinds of tears and that smile and that upright posture, and that infusion that you can be bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. Got it? 

00:27:25
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:27:30
 Really got it. Okay, then come back here. Uh-hmm. Shake that off just a little bit so that you can... Uh-huh, and you come back here. Uh-hmm, and then, ah, I'm just if it's okay with you - 

00:27:45
TANA Uh-huh. 

00:27:45
 - to be a surrogate for a moment. Right? And may I touch you. May I put my hands on your shoulder? 

00:27:50
TANA Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:27:50
 Right. 

00:27:50
TANA Yeah. 

00:27:55
 And that for a moment, you could-- can close your eyes and that somehow and someway, you could feel that bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:15
 And that you could feel the permission and the potency, and the protection with those hands represent in the sense of letting go, in the sense of some tears wash away old hurts. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
 And when you can begin to sense that you could begin to feel that then I invite you to gently nod your head so that I know that you're doing it. And then with your eyes close, I'd like you gently look up to the top of your head, take a deep breath, and really begin to memorize that feeling, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. Just like as a little girl, you could memorize roller skating or you could memorize riding a bicycle. This is something you memorize in your body. Something that you could feel and realize in your guts. Yes. 

00:29:50
[sil.] 

00:29:55
 And then I'm going to remove my hands and know, even though I removed my hands, it could be quite possible, quite real, quite powerful that the memory of that touch, the memory of that feeling, the memory of that permission, potency, and protection can really be there. 

00:30:25
[sil.] 

00:30:35
 And I would invite you to stay with it and feel it, and then, enjoy it and experience the play and the interplay in your mind, in your body. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:30:55
 Committing yourself to the knowledge that you have learned something important. 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:10
 Something that can now guide you. Something that can be a moment of destiny that commits you to a path and that path can be one of how you will be an integrity with yourself even if... 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:31:45
 And somehow those words meant something to you deeply being an integrity with yourself no matter what. And those could be strong tears, good tears, acknowledging tears. 

00:32:10
[sil.] 

00:32:15
 Tears of insight, tears of realization, and tears, tears of destiny. 

00:32:25
[sil.] 

00:32:35
 And I invite you to just let yourself. Enjoy a few easy breaths. That upright sensation your head, that sense of your feet being on the floor, that feeling of your arms containing you and that sense of being enveloped by tones, tempos, sounds, and empowered by those tones and tempos. And then when you're ready I had invite you to bring yourself back here reoriented and completely, fully reoriented and just take one or two, three easy breaths and begin to bring yourself back here fully alert and reoriented. Hi. Uh-hmm. Some glint in your eye, ah. 

00:33:55
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:33:55
 What, what's your understanding? Well, would you like me to know about your experience? 

00:34:05
TANA Uhm, I felt really peaceful. 

00:34:05
 Really at peace. 

00:34:05
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:34:05
 Yeah. That's that glint in your eye. 

00:34:10
TANA Relax. 

00:34:10
 Really relax, uh-huh. 

00:34:10
TANA Happy. 

00:34:10
 Very happy. 

00:34:15
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:34:15
 Yeah, fantastic. 

00:34:15
TANA Yeah. 

00:34:15
 Uh-huh, and because I would, would not do this in, in, ah, a therapy situation but we're in a teaching situation and a learning situation. 

00:34:30
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:34:30
 Help us. What, what was the most meaningful part? What really could-- if you could say and you don't have to say - 

00:34:40
TANA Yeah. 

00:34:40
 - because the Gestalt is more than any of the individual parts. 

00:34:45
TANA Yeah. Uhm, I really like standing, ah, uhm, back there and... 

00:34:55
 Yup. 

00:34:55
TANA Yeah. 

00:34:55
 That meant a lot. 

00:35:00
TANA That did. Yeah. 

00:35:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:35:00
TANA I like that. 

00:35:00
 And then, there was that's-- that moment that something about okay, I'm going to be an integrity with myself. 

00:35:05
TANA Yeah. 

00:35:10
 That no matter what, I can be an integrity with myself. Uh-hmm. 

00:35:15
TANA Yeah. You know, I, I have just had a realization that, that his-- I don't need to suffer for his actions. 

00:35:30
 That's a big realization. 

00:35:30
TANA Yeah. 

00:35:30
 Big realization. Uh-hmm. 

00:35:35
TANA I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. 

00:35:35
 Yeah, uh-huh. 

00:35:40
TANA So I didn't, I didn't do anything. 

00:35:40
 That's right. 

00:35:45
TANA I can still be sad for what happened - 

00:35:45
 Yes. 

00:35:50
TANA - but I don't need to carry around all that regret that I should have done something. 

00:35:55
 Okay. 

00:35:55
TANA Yeah. 

00:35:55
 We have a little more time and I, I would like to in-- invite you to take it once step further. 

00:36:05
TANA Okay. 

00:36:05
 Uh-huh, and so, ah, imagine that your father is sitting here and at your level. 

00:36:15
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:36:15
 Maybe then a little bit lower. 

00:36:15
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:36:15
 Uh-huh. Uh-hmm. And then, ah, say to him, uhm, three resent-- resentments. One or two, or three resentments. You-- you've done that before but I think it'd even start... 

00:36:30
TANA Thing that I resent. 

00:36:35
 I resent that you did this - 

00:36:35
TANA Yeah. 

00:36:35
 - when you could have done this - 

00:36:35
TANA Right. 

00:36:35
 - and you could have done this. 

00:36:40
TANA Right 

00:36:40
 Uh-hmm. 

00:36:40
TANA I relent that. I... 

00:36:40
 Uh-huh, so imagine that he's there - 

00:36:45
TANA Okay. 

00:36:45
 - and say, and say that I, you know, resent the flack and I resent the fact that you weren't accessing all of the integrity that I know that you had. 

00:36:55
TANA Yes. 

00:36:55
 Uh-huh. Okay, so... 

00:37:00
TANA So I resent the fact that you make sure we all knew it was so important to be honest. We got more trouble for lying than if we just would have told the truth. Than you sit there and lie to me then I feel like an idiot and disrespecting my father who I love so much. I love you. 

00:37:35
 Yeah, and who... 

00:37:35
TANA For 22 years, you just pretend that nothing happened. 

00:37:45
 And I resent it. 

00:37:45
TANA I resent that, that we lost those 22 years. That you can live just been straight up with me. 

00:37:55
 Yes, that you were-- you didn't do it. 

00:37:55
TANA You didn't do it. 

00:37:55
 Uh-hmm. 

00:37:55
TANA You didn't-- you're such a strong man. Why didn't you do that? 

00:38:00
 All right and those are bitter tears. Those are angry tears. 

00:38:05
TANA Yes, yes. 

00:38:10
 And now, I am gonna push along just a little bit because I have a little procedure in my mind. 

00:38:15
TANA Okay. 

00:38:15
 So say-so regrets. 

00:38:20
TANA Say something what? 

00:38:20
 Regrets. 

00:38:20
TANA Regrets. 

00:38:20
 Yes. I regret that I didn't talk with you. I regret... 

00:38:25
TANA Yes, I regret that I just didn't get up the courage and just say, "Dad, I need to go into your office with you for an hour." And it would have been uncomfortable and it would have been... 

00:38:40
[sil.] 

00:38:45
TANA That would have been really hard but I, I agree I should-- I regret that I, that I didn't just get up the courage and be brave and just talk to you about it. 

00:39:00
 Okay, and because I'm rushing the process a little bit because of our constraints heal. 

00:39:05
TANA Yeah. 

00:39:05
 Say some appreciations. 

00:39:10
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:39:10
 Dad, I appreciate-- father, I appreciate... 

00:39:15
TANA Dad, I, I so appreciate everything you taught me. What a wonderful kind man you are, how loving you are, how-- just the force that you were there, that amazing person you are in our family, what-- everything you taught me... 

00:39:50
[sil.] 

00:39:55
TANA All the support you gave me in my life, you are just-- you're amazing. I love you. 

00:40:00
 I love you. And now, what I would invite you to do is to say that in here, I love you. 

00:40:15
TANA I love you, dad. 

00:40:15
 And then, say it with your hands somehow. With your hands, express that feeling. No words, just your hands. 

00:40:30
TANA Yeah. It was, it was just peace right here. 

00:40:35
 Uh-hmm. 

00:40:35
TANA Yeah, but it's just... 

00:40:35
 Do it again. Do it feel all right? 

00:40:40
TANA Yeah. Uh-hmm. 

00:40:45
 Would it be okay of doing that with your feet? I have no idea. 

00:40:55
TANA I don't know. 

00:40:55
 Yeah. 

00:41:00
TANA I don't know. 

00:41:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:41:00
TANA I think just, just that. 

00:41:05
 And, and maybe with a sound. 

00:41:05
TANA Just like, uh. 

00:41:05
 Okay, great. 

00:41:05
TANA Yeah. 

00:41:10
 See him. 

00:41:10
TANA Yeah. 

00:41:10
 Given that, uh. And you're taking it in. 

00:41:15
TANA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:41:15
 Not only giving it out. Beautiful. 

00:41:20
TANA Yeah. 

00:41:20
 Now, with your hands are very smart. 

00:41:20
TANA Yeah. 

00:41:20
 Uh-hmm. 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:30
 And then... 

00:41:30
TANA Well, it could be on, it could be on. 

00:41:30
 And then how would you like to say goodbye? 

00:41:40
[sil.] 

00:41:50
TANA It's hard cuz I'm still not wanting to say goodbye even though it has to. 

00:41:50
 Yes. Part of you, I'm sure, wishes he was still here and this may not be the right moment or the right place. That I had a strange thought into it, intuitive sense that, you know, and if you are in Japan, ah, a moment of saying hello, a moment of saying goodbye would be a bow. In the Jewish tradition that I come from, a moment of saying hello, a moment of saying goodbye would be shalom. You know the meaning of shalom? Peace. 

00:42:40
TANA I, I like that. 

00:42:45
 Okay. 

00:42:45
TANA Yeah. 

00:42:45
 So could, could you chose one of those things and orient yourself towards him for a moment and, and quietly and even privately in, in your mind as this as a moment of this. 

00:43:10
[sil.] 

00:43:15
TANA Shalom. 

00:43:20
 Yeah, and then close your eyes and feel the warmth of your hand and that your hand has a knowledge of shalom, peace. And that if you are making a gesture of peace you might do exactly what you're doing right now which is putting your hand over your heart and opening your hand. And in the quietness of your mind, your spirit, I would invite you to feel the warmth of your hand and the way in which your hand can have its own rhythm, and its own tone, and its own tempo. And your hand can have its own way of enveloping your heart with the sense of shalom. 

00:44:35
TANA Yeah. 

00:44:35
 And that you can take a moment in the quietness of your mind, of your spirit, your body to feel the essence of that and just like I put my hand on your shoulders so that you could really memorize that feeling - 

00:45:00
TANA Yeah. 

00:45:00
 - easily, fully, completely that the essence of that feeling, the spirit of that feeling can be with you. And that you could imagine it, envisioned it at work, at home, and in relationships in the way in which you nod your head to different kind of movement. A different kind of head nod more of the unconscious variety of experience. 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:05
 And then in a moment I'm going to ask you if it's all right to bring yourself back to reorient yourself and to feel free to bring back any, any of those feelings with you. Hi. How was that? 

00:46:25
TANA That was really nice. 

00:46:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:46:25
TANA Very peaceful. 

00:46:30
 I'm sorry. 

00:46:30
TANA Peaceful. 

00:46:30
 Really peaceful. 

00:46:30
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:46:30
 Even more peaceful? 

00:46:30
TANA Yeah 

00:46:35
 Uh-huh. Even more at peace with yourself? 

00:46:35
TANA Yes. Yeah. 

00:46:40
 Because when we started, you were like this with yourself and one p-- one way of being peaceful with yourself is being here no matter what. 

00:46:50
TANA Yeah. 

00:46:55
 Uh-hmm, and that that allows you to really be peaceful with yourself. Uh-huh. 

00:47:00
TANA Yeah. 

00:47:00
 Good smile. 

00:47:00
TANA Yeah. 

00:47:05
 Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, now what is, ah, ah, your sense that that you got your money's worth? Uh-hmm. More than your money's worth. 

00:47:20
TANA Yes. Uhm, I just feel more relax. So I just, I feel. 

00:47:25
 More at ease, more relax. 

00:47:30
TANA Yeah. 

00:47:30
 Uh-huh. So, ah, when, when I started I said to you what would, ah, be your criteria? What would you want to have when we end the session? 

00:47:40
TANA Yeah. 

00:47:40
 You know, what's your sense that you have gotten what you've asked for? What your felt sense? 

00:47:50
TANA I don't remember what I've asked before. 

00:47:50
 Would its-- uh-huh. 

00:47:50
TANA Wow, yeah. You know, I don't remember actually. 

00:47:50
 Now, you don't-- it is-- that's okay. 

00:47:55
TANA Okay. 

00:47:55
 That's interesting and - 

00:47:55
TANA Okay. 

00:47:55
 - I don't wanna disrupt that. 

00:47:55
TANA Okay. 

00:48:00
 Because there's some wisdom. You know, Carl Whitaker was a tremendous influence on me and he would say at the end of the session, uhm, don't think about it. 

00:48:10
TANA Oh, yeah. 

00:48:10
 And don't talk about it and he would be doing family sessions and he would say to the members of the family, don't talk about it. You can come back next week for another session. You can talk about it then but don't talk about it. And I would, because there maybe curiosity as the people have in the audience, I would say, not only to you but to them, don't ask you about the details of your experience. 

00:48:40
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:48:40
 That what we have done is tantamount to, ah, in a medical model, it would be tantamount to abdominal surgery. And, uhm, that if you have abdominal surgery, you don't wanna think at the stitches and you don't wanna go rooting around and gardening after that abdominal surgery. You want things to just settle in and they'll have their own way of settling in and then something, ah, comes out of that that maybe bigger than any of the pieces that you could tease apart consciously. 

00:49:10
TANA Yeah. 

00:49:10
 So I, I, I would say just be with it. You know, experience it, let it, ah, take its own evolution - 

00:49:20
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:49:20
 - own maturation inside you. 

00:49:25
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:49:25
 Right? And then I, I would be really very pleased if, uhm, you know, we could do it from now. You drop me an e-mail - 

00:49:30
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:49:30
 - and tell me how you look back on the experience and what's it meant to you? 

00:49:35
TANA That would be great. 

00:49:35
 Well, that's be good. 

00:49:35
TANA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:49:40
 Would it be okay to stop here as it's feel to me - 

00:49:40
TANA Uh-hmm. 

00:49:40
 - like a good stopping places. 

00:49:45
TANA Yeah, I feel good. 

00:49:45
 It feel to you like a good stopping place. Okay. Can we thank Tana for... 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:50:00
 Okay, I know we ended, ah, a little bit early but it's, you know, it was like psychoanalysis, a 50-minute hour. So thank you so much all of you for coming here. Thanks for attending the conference. Uh-huh. 

00:50:15
