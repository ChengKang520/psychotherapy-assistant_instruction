Aquarius HEALTH CARE MEDIA In Harmony with the Heart The following program is for informational purposes only and does not constitute advice. Always discuss medical matters with your physician, health practitioner, therapist, and/or psychiatrist. 

00:00:25
NARRATOR After Natalia gave birth she knew something was wrong. Where was the joy and delight in motherhood. Instead she was overwhelmed with panic attacks, fear and a disturbing lack of connection with her baby. Natalia was experiencing a common and misunderstood mood disorder called postpartum depression. 

00:00:45
postpartum depression 

00:00:45
NARRATOR Mothers describe it as a dark fog that overwhelms their lives with anger, guilt, anxiety as well as fear. However, the outlook is good for over coming mood disorders. With treatment the darkness will give way to a brighter day. You’ll feel like yourself again. 

00:01:05
Feel like Yourself Again Understanding Postpartum Depression and other Mood Disorders 

00:01:05
NARRATOR It’s estimated that 700,0000 women a year experience postpartum depression. The most common perinatal mood disorder. 

00:01:15
rate of gestational diabetes 1%-3% rate of Down Syndrome(35-year-old woman) 3% both conditions are commonly screened for by physicians postpartum depression 15% - 20% or 1 in every 5 mothers 

00:01:15
NARRATOR To put this in perspective the rate of gestational diabetes for a women is between one and three percent. And the rate of having a Down syndrome baby is 3% for a 35-year-old woman. Both of these conditions are commonly screened for by physicians. However, postpartum depression has a much greater rate of 15-20%. Postpartum depression affects one in every five mothers. Yet it’s rarely screened for or even asked about during medical examinations. Postpartum depression and other mood disorders can be tremendously stressful illnesses for the family as well as the mother. 

00:01:50
explore the five mood disorder steps to prevent mood disorders importance of family support how to find help 

00:01:50
NARRATOR This program will explore the five mood disorders that can affect new mothers, What steps may prevent a mood disorder illness, the importance of family support and how to find help. We’ll feature interviews with experts on prenatal and postpartum depression as well as mothers who have experienced this disorder and recovered to enjoy their lives again. If you are pregnant, a new mother or planned to have a child this program is for you. If you are a father to be or a new dad, a family member or a friend of a new mom, this program is especially important for you. Partners, family and friends may be able to recognize initial symptoms. Your support and understanding could help a new mom receive early diagnosis as well as treatment. And that’s the good news. Perinatal mood disorders are very treatable especially with early intervention. However, if left untreated perinatal depression can have devastating consequences. 

00:02:50
SHOSHANA BENNETT , Ph.D. Postpartum Depression Specialist It was horrible in my house. I suffered two very serious undiagnosed postpartum depression so back in the ‘80s and there was no help for me in Northern California. There was… there was nothing. So my family and I suffered for years. When I finally realized that what I had been going through had a name and it was treatable, I really became angry and quite disturbed that there was no information out there. So actually I changed my profession. I went from being a special education teacher to a slowly but surely studying more about this illness and pioneering Northern California started knocking on doors of hospitals and… and volunteering to lead groups in various places and started running groups out of my living room in Castro Valley. That’s really how it started for me. It was horrible and very, very slowly I began to recover and became a psychologist and now really my mission is to educate medical professionals, mental health professionals and the public. So that women would never have to go through what I went through. 

00:04:05
NARRATOR Shoshana’s experience is not unique. Complicating matters is a lack of training available to health care providers. 

00:04:10
PEC INDMAN , Ed.D., MFT Postpartum Depression Specialist Most therapist, most physicians have had no training in diagnosing and treating prenatal and postpartum mood disorders. They don’t really have any familiarity with it. Its not part of standard course work um, I was trained as a family practice physician assistant at Johns Hopkins. I have masters in health psychology, doctorate in counseling. None of this material was covered. 

00:04:35
NARRATOR Today Dr. Bennett and Dr. Indman travel extensively providing consultations and training to a variety of professionals and organizations. They have also written a book for mothers as well as health professionals about prenatal and postpartum depression. 

00:04:45
Perinatal Mood Disorders go beyond The Baby Blues Not considered a disorder 80%of mothers emotional letdown lack of concentration sadness and weepiness 

00:04:50
NARRATOR Here is a basic over view of perinatal mood disorders. Many women experience a mild depression called the baby blues. This short lived condition is not considered a disorder and it occurs in about 80% of mothers. As hormones in the mother’s body adjust in not being pregnant, a new mother may experience an emotional let down, lack of concentration, sadness and weepiness. The symptoms may begin a few hours after giving birth to a few days. As the mother’s hormones return to normal the baby blues often go away on their own after a few weeks. The five perinatal mood disorders go beyond the baby blues in severity and length of time. While there is still mystery as to why it happens, experts believe that the primary causes for these mood disorders are hormonal changes which affect the brain. Along with other stresses including relationship problems, financial worries, illness and social isolation. Other factors include experiencing a difficult birth, sleep deprivation, a traumatic family history and the high and often unrealistic expectations of motherhood. 

00:06:00
difficult birth sleep deprivation traumatic family history unrealistic expectations of motherhood The five mood disorders: Postpartum Depression and/or Anxiety Panic Disorder Postpartum Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Postpartum Psychosis Postpartum Depression and/or Anxiety Occurs in about 15 - 20 percent of mothers 

00:06:00
NARRATOR The five mood disorders are postpartum depression and/or anxiety, Panic disorder, Postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder, Posttraumatic stress disorder and Postpartum psychosis. It’s important to note that these disorders can also occur during pregnancy following a miscarriage or termination of pregnancy. Postpartum depression and/or anxiety occurs in about 15-20% of mothers. It may develop slowly or quite rapidly and it can occur at any time during the first year. A women suffering from postpartum depression may experience good days and alternating bad days with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. 

00:06:45
excessive worry anxiety panic attacks irritability short-temper overwhelmed sadness hopelessness sleeplessness weightloss or gain discomfort around baby lack of feeling toward baby 

00:06:45
NARRATOR Some of the symptoms include excessive worry, anxiety or panic attacks, irritability or short-temper, feeling overwhelmed, persistent sadness, hopelessness, sleeplessness, significant weight loss or gain, discomfort around the baby and lack of feeling toward the baby. Depression and anxiety are the most common disorders. However, would be impossible to list every symptom. Dr. Indman has insight based on her clients experiences. 

00:07:20
PEC INDMAN They vary from person to person and again there are some women who just have severe anxiety postpartum. They may be getting panic attacks or find they are worrying about every little thing. They are worrying about this way out in the future. They are up at night, they can’t sleep because their mind is just swirling. There are women who get severe depression and they may be crying a lot, they may be withdrawn. I have people who you know, I’m just… I used to be so social and now I’m not answering email, I’m not returning phone calls, I don’t leave the house. But also you know we have a stereotype I think of postpartum depression. You know, if somebody curled up in a ball and that’s not necessarily how it always appears and in fact in some recent work that came out of um, 150 of my clients, we really found that… that some of the top symptoms were irritability which you know may be related to sleep deprivation. Every body who… who doesn’t sleep well is irritable. But women describe feeling like I’m on an emotional rollercoaster. They feel all alone even though they may have the village(ph) and lots of family and friends around them. They become very alone in different. They feel like they are not their normal self and um, so this symptoms really can be surprising. Its not often what we expect. 

00:08:40
Panic Disorder Occurs in about 10 percent of postpartum women extreme anxiety shortness of breath chest pain choking dizziness hot/cold flashes numbness palpitations tingling sensations Natalia’s Story 

00:08:40
NARRATOR Panic disorder occurs in about 10% of postpartum women. The symptoms include episodes of extreme anxiety, shortness of breath, chest pain, choking sensations and dizziness, hot/cold flashes, numbness, palpitations or tingling sensations. During the attack, the women may fear she is going crazy or even dying. Natalia suffered from postpartum depression and panic disorder. Her anxiety began when her baby was born several weeks early and breastfeeding was difficult. 

00:09:15
NATALIA And so nursing became a huge issue um, that put a great deal of stress on me and causing me to feel a lot of feelings that I didn’t want to feel as a new mother. But on top of that I felt this overwhelming disconnection with my baby. I did not feel the slightest(ph) bit of love for this baby and I… and I felt disconnected to myself as well not just the baby and I remember calling my mom up one day and I just broke down and started sobbing and I said I wanna give him back and then she said you know, ‘Honey, give him back to who?’ and I said, ‘I don’t know. I don’t care but I need to give him back. I can’t. I don’t love this baby and I don’t want… to I can’t take care of him. I don’t think I could be a good mom. 

00:09:55
NARRATOR Natalia called a postpartum support line and reached Stephanie Wilson. 

00:10:05
STEPHANIE WILSON , LMFT Postpartum Depression Specialist Natalia had very classic symptoms. She had rapid weight loss, she couldn’t eat, I mean she had lost all of her baby weight and then some by you know the first couple of weeks. So she was having a difficulty eating. She was extremely anxious, she was extremely depressed. 

00:10:20
NATALIA I actually spent a lot of time in my bedroom, under my covers, with the shades all drawn because I was afraid that by taking my head out and opening my eyes I will have to face something and I really don’t know what it was but I had to face something. May be was motherhood you know life, I don’t know. But I couldn’t face it whatever it was and um, and then just you know your heart beats very… very fast. Um, and you are just scared. You are so scared of every thing. I didn’t want my husband to leave the house. I was afraid he was gonna get wreck. I was afraid that you know even though I didn’t feel connected to my baby and I didn’t feel that overwhelming love for him, I was having really more big thoughts of things that would happen to both him and my husband. You know, crazy, horrible thoughts. And you can’t make it go away. You know, you just you continuously thinking these things and… and so the thoughts of my husband even driving to the store would send me into severe panic attack. 

00:11:20
NARRATOR As she spoke to Natalia Stephanie recognized the other common yet terrifying symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks and overwhelming fear. 

00:11:30
STEPHANIE WILSON We were just very concerned. She even felt you know, I… I assessed her suicide and she is like I can’t do this. If I continue to feel like this I will not be here. 

00:11:40
NATALIA Again I felt like a total failure as a mom and I felt like my baby deserve something better and um, more importantly I couldn’t live that way. I just couldn’t live in constant total fear and panic and you felt like it will never go away and even though my doctor and Stephanie Wilson you know they were really trying to convince me and I mean, I felt so bad for them. They just you know wanted to reach out and shake me and you know convince me that it would go away. But in my own head, I knew it wasn’t gonna go away. I would be that one person that it just didn’t work for that the medication wouldn’t work for or that you know I wouldn’t get better and um, I knew I couldn’t live that way. 

00:12:25
STEPHANIE WILSON And she is telling me, I don’t feel anything for this baby. It’s just very strange but as he would fuss she is talking to me and she is her body was completely in tune with this child and I was just watching her because she would sit there and she talk to me and she’d rock him and she would hold him close to her chest and… and I had to tell her that I said you know, ‘I understand that you are not feeling it but your child is totally mesmerized by… He was just watching, he was engaged with her and even though she was at emotionally feeling like she was present. I think intuitively her body was still in the moment. And I remember when I told her that she said that really made a huge difference for her because she says that you could see that there was something in me that was maternal gave me hope. 

00:13:15
NARRATOR With treatment and therapy Natalia recovered and it’s perfectly obvious that she adores her son. Just as it was for Natalia its often difficult for women to ask for help because they feel shame and embarrassment. However, as Natalia explains there is one person who is depending on you. 

00:13:30
NATALIA Who care what any body else things you need to do whatever you need to do, to take care of yourself and your child and that’s exactly what I went through. You know, those first five weeks I just… I didn’t want to tell anybody. Even after I knew what was going on I didn’t want to tell anybody. I’ve never told anybody about the thoughts of suicide expect for my doctor and husband and um, but you know you are ashamed. You are embarrassed especially because you feel like you know, you should have control over this but its okay you don’t and you don’t need to worry about what anyone else thinks because the only thing you need to worry about is yourself and your child. 

00:14:10
 Red 

00:14:15
NATALIA Red yeah. Oh look at the teddy bear in the wagon. 

00:14:15
Postpartum Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Occurs in about 3 -5 percent of new mothers 

00:14:20
NARRATOR Postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs in 3-5% of new mothers. The women may have thoughts that are terrifying and out of character for her. The symptoms include intrusive repetitive thoughts. Thoughts that are often about hurting or killing the baby. Followed by tremendous sense of horror and disgust about having these thoughts. Symptoms include repetitive counting, checking and cleaning over and over again. 

00:14:45
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Very little information available recurrent nightmares extreme anxiety reliving past events that had sexual, physical or emotional trauma Postpartum Psychosis Very rare 1 or 2 of every 1000 women who give birth extreme anxiety & agitation severe insomnia hallucinations delirious states of mind suicidal or homicidal thoughts Postpartum psychosis is a severe emergency and Postpartum Psychosis requires immediate medical attention 

00:14:50
NARRATOR Posttraumatic stress disorder, there is very little information available on how many women experienced this disorder or when it occurs. However, the symptoms include recurrent nightmares, extreme anxiety, reliving past events that had sexual, physical or emotional trauma. Postpartum psychosis is the most severe postpartum disorder. Thankfully its also the most rare. It occurs in about 1 or 2 of every 1000 women who give birth. The woman with postpartum psychosis has lost touch with reality. This disorder has a 5% suicide rate and a four percent infanticide rate. The symptoms may include extreme anxiety and agitation, severe insomnia, hallucinations, delirious states of mind and suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Postpartum psychosis is a severe emergency and requires immediate medical attention. This disorder is treatable and prognosis is good with early intervention. However, the rare condition of postpartum psychosis with its hallucinations and delusional thinking is often confused with postpartum depression. 

00:16:05
PEC INDMAN I’ve had physician say to the client do you think you might have postpartum depression and in their mind they hear do you wanna kill your baby. You know, unfortunately the media has done as a service and it is service in terms of how postpartum depression has been portrayed and so they don’t think they have a postpartum mood disorder. So I think that really um, has kept women from getting help. I think there is still in our society that the sentiment about, ‘Oh just buck up and suck it up and I had five kids and why cant you’ and I think that really keeps women from getting the help they need. 

00:16:40
NARRATOR As Shoshana and Pec conduct their training seminars one of the goals is to dispel myths surrounding mood disorders. 

00:16:50
SHOSHANA BENNETT Often people are thinking and people meaning professional and the… and the public and women going through it they are really thinking that if a woman was ready to have a child she would not be going through this. Had she been prepared or may be she was ill before and this… is just coming to the surface now. You know, some how there must be a deficiency or some kind of inadequacy about her. That would be the overall myth or stereotype about a women going… going through this and that’s simply not true. 

00:17:20
PEC INDMAN When people come into my office and they often might be referred by their OB or their lactation consultant or um, you know primary care doctor. They often are in a pretty bad state. They are crying, they are you know, severely depressed or having panic attacks and I think unless it’s really interfering with life. Women just think you know it supposed to be hard, I should be tired all the time and I think that keeps women from getting the help they need. I think there is a big stigma um, and I think we’d be in naïve if we didn’t acknowledge. There is a big stigma about mental health, about mental illness and in particular now there is a big fear about postpartum mood disorders. I think there is fear if you ask for help. Your child may be taken away. There is a fear that um, you will be labeled. 

00:18:15
NARRATOR The symptoms along with misinformation and misconceptions can leave a woman feeling ashamed, guilty and isolated. Shoshana and Pec remind their clients of the six truths. 

00:18:25
I will recover 

00:18:25
I will recover 

00:18:30
NARRATOR Pec and Shoshana have never met a women who after proper treatment did not recover. 

00:18:35
I am not alone 

00:18:35
I am not alone. 

00:18:35
NARRATOR One in five women will experience a postpartum reaction more severe than the baby blues. 

00:18:40
This is not my fault 

00:18:40
This is not my fault 

00:18:45
NARRATOR You didn’t ask for this to happen. It’s an illness. 

00:18:45
I am a good mom! 

00:18:50
I am a good mom. 

00:18:50
NARRATOR The fact that you are improving the quality of your life and your family proves that you are a good mom. 

00:18:55
I am going to take care of myself 

00:18:55
I am going to take care of myself 

00:19:00
NARRATOR It’s important to take care of yourself. You can get better. 

00:19:00
I am doing the best I can! 

00:19:00
I am doing the best I can. 

00:19:05
NARRATOR Keep in mind that you are taking steps to get better and that’s what's important. Perinatal mood disorders can happen to any women including health professionals. 

00:19:15
SHOSHANA BENNETT Often the professionals, especially mental health professionals are very reluctant to realize that no one is immune. Oh my gosh! I’m going through this too. Very often um, nurses who are clients of mine and pediatricians are clients of mine will says, ‘This can’t be happening to me. I take care of every body else in crisis.” And what I tell them is that your hormones don’t care what you do for your living. That no one is immune. 

00:19:40
Treatment 

00:19:45
NARRATOR Perinatal mood disorders do respond to treatment. There is a variety of methods depending on the severity of symptoms. Many other therapies are available as well as new methods that are being studied. The important consideration is to work with the knowledgeable health practitioner and develop an individualized treatment plan. The key is to find someone who understands perinatal mood disorders. So how does one find health professional who is experienced and knowledgeable. 

00:20:10
PEC INDMAN Well, I think that’s the question when you call don’t just blindly go off your insurance panel or whoever some one recommends. The questions that I recommend are to say do you have any experience in working with pregnancy or postpartum mood disorders. Have you had any training which is difficult because really there is very little training around. Um, and then that might encourage them to get some training. The other questions I always have people ask a therapist is can you recommend any books on the topic. Um, a therapist who work with couples can list five books about couples. Therapist who work with death and dying can just list five of their favorite books on death and dying. And if a therapist really can’t recommend a book on this topic then in my experience, in my feeling they really don’t have any expertise in that area. There is at least you know four or five books around on postpartum mood disorders. Many of them are old now but there… there are books. 

00:21:05
NARRATOR Another important factor is to get treatment early. 

00:21:10
PEC INDMAN What we know about depression and anxiety as well is that the longer you suffer from it, the harder it is to get better. The longer it is, its kind of like pain. You know, if you wait till your pain is on the ceiling, it’s hard to bring it down. 

00:21:25
5 keys to prevention Physical and Emotional Support Sleep Nutrition Protein Water Omega 3’s Take Regular Breaks Medication 

00:21:25
NARRATOR Research is also uncovering ways to help prevent postpartum depression. 

00:21:30
SHOSANA BENNETT There are five keys to preventing a postpartum depression. One is physical and emotional support. Some body to lean on, some body to talk to um, things like this. Some body to take care of the physical chores. The second is sleep. We need at least five hours of uninterrupted sleep at night to keep our biorhythms on track or serotonin levels even and our moods pretty stable. The third is nutrition. For instance, nibbling protein through out the day can help keep our blood sugar levels at more even and there fore our moods more stable. Um, drinking enough water and getting enough hydration can definitely help our anxiety level. Omega 3’s are showing up more and more in the literatures some thing that also might help. The next way to prevent a postpartum depression taking regular breaks away from your baby. This is the only job were breaks are not mandated by law. So if we don’t set up those breaks they don’t happen. So a good three to four times per week, especially a primary care taker needs to have regular nurturing time, just for herself to recharge her batteries. And the last way to prevent the postpartum depression is taking a look at medication. If she in fact needs medication, that would be a very important way to prevent an occurrence. 

00:22:55
NARRATOR Its important for the immediate family to be aware postpartum depression. Because they may be able to see the signs that a health professional may miss or not have the opportunity to discovery. 

00:23:05
PEC INDMAN Once the women has her six week postpartum check up, she really is kind of out of the medical field and I think there are number of ways she can get recognized. One is family members may notice she is just not acting herself. She may be more irritable, more weepy, kind of prone to break down into tears, she may um, not be laughing or singing or just acting like her normal self. She may not be enjoying normal activities. 

00:23:35
NARRATOR Its important to get diagnosed and treated early. Not just for the women but for the health of the marriage too. 

00:23:45
PEC INDMAN Postpartum mood disorders are really tough on the marriage. If you are irritable and cranky you kind of protect the baby but it’s often the husbands or the partners that really get the brunt of the irritability. 

00:23:55
What a Partner Should NOT Say 

00:23:55
NARRATOR The intention may be well meaning but these statements can cause pain. 

00:24:00
 Why are you so sad when there is so much to be happy about? 

00:24:05
NARRATOR Exactly. That’s why she feels so guilty for being depressed. 

00:24:10
 Things will get better if you just relax. 

00:24:10
NARRATOR This usually creates the opposite effect. Depression is not something that can be simply pushed out of the mind. 

00:24:20
 Come on, if time is not part of it. 

00:24:20
NARRATOR Think about it. If she could, she certainly would snap out of it. 

00:24:25
 Just think positively. 

00:24:30
NARRATOR The nature of depression prevents positive thinking. The women is in a dark fog which filters out much of the bright cheery aspects of life. 

00:24:35
Supportive and Helpful Things to Say “We’ll get through this. I’m here for you.” “What can I do to help?” “This is temporary. You’ll get yourself back.” “This isn’t your fault. If I were sick, you wouldn’t blame me.” be a good listener compliment her avoid negative comments be patient postpartum illness fluctuate throughout the recovery period Other ways to help… make a dinner watch the baby clean the house go shopping for her take time and listen Can a woman recover from a mood disorder? 

00:24:35
NARRATOR The following statements are more supportive and helpful. 

00:24:40
“We’ll get through this. I’m here for you.” “What can I do to help?” “This is temporary. You’ll get yourself back.” “This isn’t your fault. If I were sick, you wouldn’t blame me.” 

00:24:55
NARRATOR be a good listener without judgment, compliment her, a mothering and avoid negative comments, be patient, remember that there is often two steps forward then some times a faltering step back, postpartum illness fluctuate throughout the recovery period. Other activities may help, make a dinner, watch the baby so she can take a break, clean the house, go shopping for her, take time and listen. Can a woman recover from a mood disorder? 

00:25:25
SHOSHANA BENNETT Absolutely. The prognosis is great for postpartum depression and actually for all of the postpartum mood disorders. This is treatable and it will go away. The faster you get help, the faster you are gonna get your life back and be able to really enjoy the experience which is what we all want to do. So prognosis is best when you get help quickly and yes there is help out there. So don’t suffer in silence.
