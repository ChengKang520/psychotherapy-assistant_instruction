Evidence-Based Treatment Planning for Depression 

00:00:30
NARRATOR The following is a presentation of John Wiley and Sons. It's part of an informative series about empirically informed treatment planning. This program focuses on depression. 

00:00:40
Timothy J. Bruce Ph.D. Arthur E. Jongsma, Jr. Ph.D. 

00:00:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Hello, and welcome. I'm Art Jongsma, and joining me is my colleague Doctor Tim Bruce. Today we're going to discuss empirically informed treatment planning for depression. 

00:00:55
In This Program... DSM Criteria for Depression Essential Elements of Treatment Planning Brief History of the EST Movement Empirically Informing a Treatment Plan Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:00:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE This program is divided into a number of modules. We'll describe the DSM criteria for depression. We'll discuss the essential elements of the treatment planning process, provide a brief history of the empirically supported treatment, or EST movement, and discuss how to empirically inform a treatment plan with findings from the EST literature on depression. Finally, we'll spend some time discussing common considerations in relapse prevention. 

00:01:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Before we get started, one thing should be noted. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a treatment plan for depression can be empirically informed by incorporating goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with those of identified EST's. You'll also see brief scenarios that demonstrate aspects of the EST interventions described. It's important to note that these scenarios and this program in general are designed to be educational in nature and not intended to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about the EST's presented, references to their empirical support, clinical training materials, and training opportunities are provided in your workbook. So, let's get started. 

00:02:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE We begin by discussing empirically informed treatment planning for depression or what the DSM terms major depressive disorder. Before discussing what constitutes depression, it may be helpful to revisit how it's diagnosed. In diagnosing mood disorders such as depression, the first step is to assess for any current or past mood episodes, which are clusters of specific mood symptoms that occur over a period of time. 

00:02:35
Mood Episodes Manic Hypomanic Major Depressive Mixed 

00:02:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE There are four types of mood episodes to consider: manic, hypomanic, major depressive and mixed. These episodes are then used to make the diagnosis of a mood disorder. 

00:02:45
Mood Disorders Bipolar Manic Hypomanic Mixed Unipolar Major Depressive 

00:02:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE In the DSM, mood disorders may be bipolar, meaning that there has been or currently is evidence of a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode in the clinical picture, or they may be unipolar, meaning that there is evidence of one or more major depressive episodes without any current or past manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes. 

00:03:05
Bipolar Mood Disorders Bipolar Disorder I Bipolar Disorder II Cyclothymia 

00:03:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and a chronic low-level mood disturbance called Cyclothymia are the bipolar mood disorders. 

00:03:15
Unipolar Mood Disorders Major Depressive Disorder Dysthymia 

00:03:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Major depressive disorder and a chronic low level version of depression called dysthymia are the unipolar mood disorders. 

00:03:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. In this program, we'll be discussing empirically informed treatment planning for what DSM terms major depressive disorder, and what is commonly referred to as depression. 

00:03:35
Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder Major Depressive Episode No Manic, Hypomanic, or Mixed Episodes Unipolar, Nonpsychotic Depression 

00:03:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. For an individual to be diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder they must have experienced at least one major depressive episode but no manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes. Although depressive episodes can occur in the context of bipolar disorders and some depressive episodes may involve psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions, in this program we're concerned only with unipolar non-psychotic major depressive disorder. 

00:04:05
SIGECAPSS Sadness Interest Guilt Energy Concentration Appetite Psychomotor Sleep Suicidality 

00:04:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE So if depression is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes, what constitutes one of these episodes? An acronym useful for remembering the features of a depressive episode is SIGECAPSS, with two s's at the end, where each letter of the word stands for a specific feature of the depressive episode. Sadness, Interest, Guilt, Energy, Concentration, Appetite, Psychomotor, Sleep and Suicidality. 

00:04:35
Major Depressive Episode (MDE) Five (or more) symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning 

00:04:40
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Specifically, a major depressive episode, or MDE, is characterized by the presence of at least five of these SIGECAPPS, occuring for at least two weeks, and representing a change from previous functioning. It is very important to note that at least one of the features must be be the first S, a depressed mood or an irritable mood, or the I, representing decreased interest or pleasure. So let's look at each SIGECAP just a little closer. 

00:05:10
Sadness Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations made by others Note: Can be irritable mood, particularly in children 

00:05:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE In depression, the mood is depressed most of the day, nearly every day. This may be indicated by either the report of the client, for example, they feel sad or empty, or observations made by others, for example, they appear tearful, or both. Note that depression can also be characterized by an irritable mood. This is particularly common in children. 

00:05:30
Interest Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day 

00:05:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. In depression, there's often markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day, nearly every day. Again, as indicated by either the client's account or by observations made by others. 

00:05:45
Guilt Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day 

00:05:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive inappropriate guilt may also be present and are not merely self-reproach or guilt about having the disorder. 

00:05:55
Energy Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day 

00:06:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Depressed individuals often complain about excessive fatigue or loss of energy. 

00:06:00
Concentration Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day 

00:06:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. They often describe or show impairment in their ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions. 

00:06:10
Appetite Significant decrease in appetite or unintentional weight loss Significant increase in appetite or unintentional weight gain 

00:06:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE In its typical form, depression causes a diminished appetite and unintended weight loss. In atypical depression, appetite is increased and weight is gained. 

00:06:20
Psychomotor Psychomotor retardation (slowing) or agitation 

00:06:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE In depression, psychomotor behavior which refers to the way one moves or gestures, including their speech rate, may be slowed but it can also be agitated. 

00:06:30
Sleep Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day 

00:06:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE And the sleep disturbance seen in depression may involve difficulty falling or staying asleep, or, as in atypical depression, it may involve excessive sleep. 

00:06:40
Suicidality Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide 

00:06:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And of course, some individuals suffering depression may have thoughts of death and dying. They may have thought or have had a plan for taking their own life, and in some cases may have attempted suicide. 

00:06:55
Major Depressive Episode (MDE) Five (or more) symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning 

00:06:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE So again, to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode, five or more of these symptoms must be present during the same two week period. They must represent a change from previous functioning. 

00:07:05
Major Depressive Episode (MDE) At least one of the symptoms is either depressed (or irritable) mood or loss of interest or pleasure 

00:07:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE And at least one of the symptoms must be a depressed mood, which could be irritable as well, or loss of interest or pleasure. 

00:07:15
Major Depressive Episode (MDE) Symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode, an episode occurring in Bipolar Disorder in which depressive and manic symptoms are mixed 

00:07:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE In addition, the SIGECAPSS cannot co-occur with manic symptoms, such as accelerated speech, flight of ideas, or heightened impulsivity as seen in whats called a mixed episode. Mixed episodes are treated diagnostically like manic episodes in that their presence indicates a bipolar mood disorder. 

00:07:35
Major Depressive Episode (MDE) Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning 

00:07:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Finally, the depressive symptoms cause clinically significant distress or disability through impairment typically in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. 

00:07:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. In summary, major depressive disorder or depression is a mood disorder characterized by one or more major depressive episodes. Having reviewed what constitutes depression, we'll now move on to the process of treatment planning and describe its essential aspects. 

00:08:05
Six Steps to a Treatment Plan Identify Primary & Secondary Problems Describe Behavioral Definitions Diagnosis Based on DSM/ICD Criteria Specify Long-term Goals Create Short-term Objectives Select Treatment Interventions 

00:08:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE There are six primary steps in developing a treatment plan. Each is customized to the individual client's unique presentation. These steps are: identify the client's primary and secondary problems, describe behavioral definitions of the problem, that is each problem's behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal symptom manifestations. Make a diagnosis based on the DSM or the ICD criteria, specify the long-term goals for the treatment process, create short-term objectives for the client, and select treatment interventions. 

00:08:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. A client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment. But as a first step in creating a treatment plan, the clinician must determine the most significant problem or problems. This is often done by assessing which problems are most related to current distress, disability, or both. Usually a primary problem will surface and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few identified problems or treatment will lose its direction. 

00:09:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave or interact will be to some degree unique to them and their situation. So each problem that's selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how its evidenced in your client. So as the second step in the treatment planning process, the behavioral definition of the problem is specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria like those found in the DSM or the ICD. You should keep these in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. 

00:09:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The third step in treatment planning, the determination of an appropriate diagnosis, is based on an evaluation of the client's complete clinical presentation. The clinician must note the behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal features causing distress or diability. And then compare them to the criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder as described in the DSM or ICD. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnosis per se, in formulating their treatment plans. But instead, prefer to focus on changes in the identified problem behavior, cognition, emotions and the like. Having said that, most third party payers require a diagnosis and most EST's are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems. So it's usually necessary to make a diagnosis. 

00:10:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Step four in developing a treatment plan is to set long-term goals for the resolution of the client's primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted in measurable terms but can be broader and indicate a desired, general, positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. 

00:11:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Writing short-term objectives for the client to achieve is step five. In contrast to long-term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measurable or observable terms. Clearly stated objectives are helpful to both the therapist and the client in assessing progress. They're also important to quality assurance review agencies, health maintenance organizations, and managed care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objectives should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. 

00:11:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Interventions are the actions of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives. Selecting the appropriate therapist interventions is the sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least one intervention planned for every client objective. If the client doesn't accomplish the objective after the initial intervention's been implemented, then new interventions should be considered in the plan. 

00:12:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. From what we've just described, it may sound like this is a pretty cut and dried process and that you simply just repeat the process with every client. But that's really not the case. One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client's unique problems, strengths and needs. Treatment plans should never be boilerplate, even if clients have similar problems. 

00:12:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Good point, Art. The individual's strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, cultural and social network, family circumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing any treatment strategy. Clinicians should rely on their own good judgment and select interventions that are appropriate for the distinctive individual with whom they're working. 

00:13:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Now that we've discussed the steps involved in treatment planning, let's move on to showing how this treatment planning process can be informed by psychotherapy outcome research. 

00:13:20
Brief History of the Movement to Identify ESTs 

00:13:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. We being by providing a brief overview of the movement to identify empirically supported psychological treatments. 

00:13:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Although it can be argued that the movement to empirically informed psychological treatment began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in earnest in the early 1990's, both in Great Britain and in the United States. On the forefront of the movement here was Division 12 of the American Psychological Association, The Society of Clinical Psychology. 

00:13:55
Society of Clinical Psychology American Psychological Association, Division 12 Task Force on Psychological Interventions Refers to: the original Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures and the subsequent Task Force on Psychological Interventions 

00:13:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE In 1993, Division 12 organized a task force on psychological interventions chaired by Doctor Diane Chamblis. It was charged with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature to identify psychological treatments whose efficacy had been demonstrated through clinical research. 

00:14:10
Criteria for Treatment Well-Established Treatments Probably Efficacious Treatments 

00:14:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE The group established criteria for judging the quantity and quality of the research supporting a particular treatment and categorized treatments meeting these criteria as either well-established or probably efficacious. More detail on the criteria used for these categories can be found in the workbook. 

00:14:25
Products of EST Reviews By 1996, 47 ESTs By 1998, 71 ESTs By 1999, Division 12 took ownership of list 

00:14:25
Society of Clinical Psychology American Psychological Association, Division 12 www.PsychologicalTreatments.org 

00:14:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE By 1996, the group had identified a preliminary list of 47 EST's. By 1998, the list had grown to 71. In 1999, Division 12 took full ownership of maintaining this growing list. The current list and more information can be found on its website. 

00:14:45
Children (Lonigan & Elbert, 1998) Pediatric Psychology (Spirito, 1999) Older Adults (Gatz, 1998) Adult, Child, Marital, Family Therapy (Kendall & Chambless, 1998) Psychopharmacology and Psychological Treatments (Nathan & Gorman, 1998, 2002, 2007) 

00:14:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Since the work of this original group, other reviewers have emerged using the same or similar criteria to review literature related to other populations, problems and interventions. These are some examples. And as we mentioned, Great Britain was on the forefront of these efforts. 

00:15:00
Websites to Note: www.nice.org.uk National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) www.nrep.shamhsa.gov Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 

00:15:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The latest products of their work can be found at the website for The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Finally, The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, or SAMHSA, for short, has recently begun an initiative to evaluate, identify, and provide information on the evidence based mental health practices. They have entitled their initiative as The National Registry of Evidence Based Programs and Practices. Their work can also be found online. In this series, we draw from these literatures to show how clinicians can integrate goals, objectives, and treatment interventions, consistent with EST's identified by these groups. 

00:15:50
Introduction to ESTs for Depression 

00:15:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Empirically informing a treatment plan involves integrating those aspects of identified EST's into each step of the treatment planning process discussed previously. The psychotherapy outcome literature on depression is one of the most researched in the field. Consequently, several therapies have been identified as empirically supported. The most comprehensive and current review provided by APA's Division 12, The Society of Clinical Psychology, has identified six therapies with strong research support, meaning that they have met the original Division 12 criteria for a well-established EST. 

00:16:25
"Well-Established EST Behavioral Therapy/Behavioral Activation Cognitive Therapy Interpersonal Therapy Problem-Solving Therapy Self-Management/Self-Control Therapy Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy 

00:16:25
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE These therapies are: behavioral therapy with behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, interpersonal therapy, problem-solving therapy, self-management/ self-control therapy and cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy. In addition, there have been a number of therapies meeting the original Division 12 criteria for probably efficacious. 

00:16:50
"Probably Efficacious" Acceptance & Commitment Therapy Behavioral Couples Therapy Emotion-Focused Therapy Short-Term Psychodynamic Therapy 

00:16:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE These are: acceptance and commitment therapy, behavioral couples therapy, emotion focused therapy, and short-term psychodynamic therapy. 

00:17:00
www.PsychologicalTreatments.org 

00:17:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. For our purposes here, we'll focus on therapies with the strongest research support. We'll briefly describe each and then show examples of how the treatment planning process can be empirically informed using goals, short-term objectives and treatment interventions that are common to several of them. It's important to note that our demonstration vignettes use selected examples from these well-established EST's and do not represent delivery of any one of them in their entirety. For those interested in learning more about any of these therapies, references to the empirical work supporting their efficacy, clinical materials, training opportunities, can be found on the Division 12 web site and are provided in the workbook. 

00:17:45
Depression Low Positive Reinforcement High Aversive Consequences 

00:17:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE In this segment we'll briefly overview each of the well-established EST's for depression starting with the behavioral therapies. Behavioral therapies for depression focus on problematic relationships between behavior and the environment in which it occurs. From the perspective of this model, depression is associated with low positive reinforcement and with high adversive consequences in the environment. It's recognized that this could be the result of a problematic environment, skill deficits in the client, or both. Those struggling with depression tend to disengage from their environment, through withdrawal or avoidance. This is thought to perpetuate depression by reducing exposure to potentially rewarding and positively reinforcing experiences that could help lift the depression. 

00:18:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. These therapies commonly use techniques such as skills training and activities scheduling which are designed to increase engagement in potentially rewarding experiences through which the client derives pleasure, a sense of mastery, purpose, and other positively reinforcing and otherwise anti-depressant emotions. 

00:18:50
Cognitive Therapy 

00:18:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive therapy for depression evolved from Beck's cognitive theory. From the perspective of this model, depression's maintained by biased information processing and maladaptive beliefs. In cognitive therapy, clients are taught to recognize their biased self talk and the role it plays in influencing depressive feelings and actions such as withdrawal. 

00:19:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. In cognitive therapy, clients learn to identify, challenge and change biased thoughts to alternatives that correct for the biases. In the prediction testing, the biased and alternative thoughts are converted into predictions and tested against reality and what is termed a behavioral experiment. Later therapy may explore underlying assumptions and beliefs reflected in biased self talk. 

00:19:35
Cognitive Therapy Increasing Activities Self-Monitoring of Mastery and Pleasure Graded Task Assignments Coping and Problem-Solving Skills 

00:19:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive therapy includes many techniques shown here that derive from behavioral traditions, including increasing activities and learning adapative coping and problem solving skills. 

00:19:45
Strategies and Techniques Psychoeducation Guided Discovery Socratic Questioning Role Playing Imagery 

00:19:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive therapists use a variety of strategies and techniques to help depressed clients address their thinking. These are just a few. 

00:19:50
Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) "IPT makes no assumption about the "cause of depression," but is based on the observation that depression occurs in an interpersonal context. By understanding and solving the current interpersonal problem(s) ...associated with the onset of symptoms, the patient will both improve their life situation and relieve their symptoms." Dr. Myrna Weissman (2005) 

00:19:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The late Doctor Gerald Klerman and Doctor Myrna Weissman developed interpersonal therapy, or IPT, for depression. As Doctor Weissman notes, IPT makes no assumption about the cause of depression but is based on the observation that depression occurs in an interpersonal context. By understanding and solving the current interpersonal problems associated with the onset of symptoms, the patient will both improve their life situation and relieve their symptoms. The initial sessions of IPT are devoted to taking a detailed interpersonal inventory. 

00:20:30
Emphasis in IPT Interpersonal Inventory Grief or Loss Personal Role Transitions Interpersonal Skills 

00:20:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Then the therapist formulates the patient's depression in interpersonal terms that can be related to some type of grief, a personal transition or a lack of interpersonal skills. 

00:20:45
IPT Strategies and Techniques Clarification Supportive Listening Encouragement of Affect Role Playing Communication Analysis 

00:20:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Common therapeutic techniques include those seen here. While IPT has been manualized, it is less directive than cognitive and behavioral therapies and does not use therapeutic homework. 

00:21:00
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) Positive Problem Orientation Problem-Solving Skills 

00:21:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Problem solving therapy or PST, teaches patients to more effectively approach and resolve problems in their lives. Through PST clients learn to approach and address their problems using what is termed a positive problem orientation as well as specific problem solving skills. The positive problem orientation refers to a motivational technique that encourages clients to see problems as an expected part of their life and that if dealt with using a problem solving approach they can be addressed and resolved satisfactorily. 

00:21:30
Problem-Solving Steps Identify Problems Generate Alternative Solutions Select the Best Solution Develop a Plan Implement the Problem-Solving Tactic Evaluate the Efficacy 

00:21:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Accordingly, clients in PST learn the steps for effective problem solving and practice using them with current problems in living. The developer of PST, Doctor Arthur Nezu has noted that outcomes have been best when the problem solving orientation component of PST is included in addition to the problem solving skills training. 

00:21:50
Self-Management/Self-Control Therapy 

00:21:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Self management self control therapy is a highly structured manualized cognitive behavioral group therapy program for the treatment of depression. The program is presented in weekly sessions that are structured and involve homework. 

00:22:05
Emphasis of SC/SM Therapy Selective attention to negative events and immediate consequences Unreasonably stringent, self-evaluative standards Negative, inaccurate attributions of responsibility for events Insufficient self-reinforcement Excessive self-punishment 

00:22:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. This model characterizes depression as involving selective attention to negative events and immediate consequences of those events, unreasonably stringent and self evaluative standards, negative inaccurate attributions of responsibility for events, insufficient self reinforcement, and excessive self punishment. Self management therapy targets specific components of depression and teaches participants self change techniques for modifying each target behavior. 

00:22:40
Self-Management Therapy Goals Help Clients Accurately View Their World Have Realistic Sense of Abilities Set Reasonable Standards Control Behavior with Feedback 

00:22:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Its goals are to help clients accurately view their world, have a realistic sense of their abilities, set reasonable standards, and control their behavior with feedback to themselves. Although often delivered in group format, the therapy can be delivered in individual format. It has been applied to the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, adults, and geriatric populations. 

00:23:10
The Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) 

00:23:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE The cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy is an integrative therapy for chronically depressed adults that combines components of cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal and psychodynamic therapies. According to this model, those with chronic depression are disconnected from their environments and don't get the feedback that they need to help them adapt effectively. In this approach, the therapeutic relationship is actively used to help patients generate empathic behavior, identify and change interpersonal patterns related to depression, and heal interpersonal trauma. 

00:23:40
CBASP Techniques Situational Analysis Interpersonal Discrimination Exercises Behavioral Skill Training/Rehearsal 

00:23:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE CBASP consists of three techniques: one, situational analysis which is a problem solving technique designed to help the patient realize the consequences of his or her behavior on others and modify it. Two, interpersonal discrimination exercises which help the patient examine past traumatic experience with others and differentiate those from healthier relationships. And three, behavioral skill training and rehearsal such as assertiveness and other communication skill training to improve the effectiveness of interpersonal functioning. It's strongly recommended by the developers of this approach that all patients who begin CBASP also begin a course of anti-depressant medication. 

00:24:25
Integrating ESTs for Depression into Treatment Planning 

00:24:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. With this background on depression, treatment planning, and EST's for depression, let's now look at how to construct an empirically informed treatment plan for depression. 

00:24:35
Behavioral Definitions Persistently depressed or irritable mood Diminished interest in or enjoyment of activities Social withdrawal Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or inappropriate guilt Lack of energy or fatigue Poor concentration and indecisiveness Loss of appetite and/or weight Psychomotor agitation or retardation Insomnia or hypersomnia Suicidal thoughts and/or gestures Low self-esteem Unresolved grief issues History of depression for which the client has been treated Others 

00:24:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The first step in treatment planning is to identify your client's manisfestations of depression. When you put this all together, you get a behavioral definition of the problem. For example, your client may exhibit sad mood, express loss of interest in previously interesting activities, maybe withdrawing from activities, feeling tired all the time, and having trouble sleeping. Other clients may show other manifestations of depression. Accordingly, the behavioral definition of your treatment plan is tailored to your individual client's clinical picture. 

00:25:10
Long-term Goals Alleviate depressed mood and return to previous level of effective functioning Recognize, accept, and cope with feelings of depression Develop healthy and adaptive cognitive patterns and beliefs about self, others, the world, and the future that lead to alleviation and help prevent the relapse of depression Develop healthy and adaptive interpersonal relationships that lead to alleviation and help prevent the relapse of depressive symptoms Apropriately grieve the loss in order to normalize mood and to return to previous adaptive level of functioning 

00:25:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Now the next step is to set some long-term goals. For example, a common goal of all treatments for depression is to reduce the distress produced by the symptoms and re-engage in a functional life. Perhaps your client shows depressive thinking patterns or beliefs that you believe maintain the depression and make him or her vulnerable for relapse. In this case, a long-term goal such as this would be appropriate. Again, long-term goals are tailored to your client's manifestation of depression and reflect the eventual desired outcome of therapy. 

00:25:40
Assessment Phase Short-Term Objectives 1. Describe current and past experiences with depression complete with its impact on function and attempts to resolve it. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assess current and past mood episodes including their features, frequency, intensity, and duration. Short-Term Objectives 2. Verbally identify, if possible, the source of depressed mood. 3. Complete psychological testing to assess the depth of depression, the need for antidepressant medication, and suicide prevention measures Therapeutic Interventions 1. Arrange for the administration of an objective assessment instrument for evaluating the client's depression and suicide risk; identify primary cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, or other contributors, give feedback to the client if clinically useful. Short-Term Objectives 4. Verbalize any history of suicide attempts and any current suicidal urges Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assess the client's history and current state of suicidal urges and behavior 2. Assess and monitor the client's suicide potential. 3. Arrange for hospitalization, as necessary, if the client is judged to be harmful to self. Short-Term Objectives 5. Keep a daily journal of depressive symptoms, including the situations in which they occurred and thoughts, feelings, and actions associated with them. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assign the client to keep a daily record of depressive symptoms, including their intensity (e.g., using Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs), the situations in which they occurred and thoughts, feelings, and actions associated with them. 

00:25:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. We now direct our attention to applying empirically supported treatments to the creation of client objectives and therapist interventions. All approaches to quality treatment start with a thorough assessment of the nature and history of the client's presenting problems. This is true of EST informed approaches as well. Clinical interview, review of assigned journal material, administration of objective measures, as well as consultation with family members or significant others are common assessment practices that can be included in the treatment plan. When depression is a prominent aspect of the client's struggles, then specific attention must be given to assessing suicide potential and taking steps to prevent self harm through hospitalization or some other reliable form of client supervision. 

00:26:35
General Psychoeducation Short-Term Objectives 1. Describe current and past experiences with depression complete with its impact on function and attempts to resolve it Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assess current and past mood episodes including their features, frequency, intensity, and duration Short-Term Objectives 2. Verbally identify, if possible, the source of depressed mood. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assist the client in making a list of what he/she is depressed about; refine toward identifying primary cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, or other contributors. Short-Term Objectives 6. Verbalize an accurate understanding of depression. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Discuss how cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and/or other factors (e.g., family history) contribute to depression. 2. Assign the client to read psychoeducational chapters of books or treatment manuals on depression. Short-Term Objectives 7. Verbalize an understanding of the rationale for treatment of depression. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Discuss how cognitive, behavioral, or interpersonal change can help clients alleviate depressiona nd return to previous level of effective functioning. 

00:26:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE A typical feature of many EST's for depression is initial and ongoing psychoeducation. Common emphases include helping the client learn about depression, the treatment, and its rationale. Often books and other reading materials are recommended to the client to supplement psychoeducation done in session. 

00:26:50
Cognitive Restructuring Short-Term Objectives 8. Identify, challenge, and change biased self-talk supporting depression. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assist the client in developing an awareness of the connection between cognition and depressive feeling and action. 2. Assign the client to keep a daily journal of automatic thoughts associated with depressive feelings; process the journal material to identify biases, develop alternatives that correct for the biases. 3. Assign "behavioral experiments" in which depressive automatic thoughts are treated as hypotheses/predictions and tested against alternative hypotheses/predictions that correct for the depressive biases. 4. Facilitate and reinforce the client's shift from biased depressive self-talk and beliefs to reality-based cognitive messages that enhance self-confidence and increase adaptive actions. 5. Explore and restructure underlying assumptions and beliefs reflected in biased self-talk that may put the client at risk for relapse or recurrence. 

00:26:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Many of the EST's for depression include objectives and interventions designed to help the client identify, challenge and change biased depressogenic thoughts that support the depression. The clinician may use discussion in the session, Socratic questioning, or review of journal material focused on daily thinking patterns to bring to light examples of the client's depressive thoughts that need to be revised and replaced. Assignments are often given to the client to ask them to test their biased thoughts against the reality of daily life. These are referred to as behavioral experiments. Much of the therapist's efforts is focused on facilitating the client's shift from depressive self talk to more reality based adaptive messages. And then reinforcing the client's efforts and progress toward accomplishing that objective. Later therapy may explore and restructure underlying assumptions and beliefs reflected in biased self talk that may put the client at risk for relapse or recurrence. 

00:28:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE As we mentioned earlier, in cognitive restructuruing, therapists help clients learn to identify biased cognitive appraisals, generate alternatives that correct for the biases, and then challenge and eventually change their thoughts to those that are more adaptive. The vignette you're about to see provides a demonstration of that process. 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN So Maria, how has the breakup with Carlos affected you? What have you been feeling? 

00:28:30
MARIA I'm so sad. I've been so depressed. I cry all the time. I'm lonely. Uhm, I don't think I can make it on my own. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN It's just a great deal of sadness and just being overwhelmed right now. I know this has been a very sad time for you. Any other feelings beyond sad and lonely? 

00:28:55
MARIA You know, uhm, at the same time I'm so angry at Carlos. He was such a liar, and fake. I'm angry with myself. I'm so stupid for being and getting into this relationship anyway, in the first place. I didn't have to. Why did this have to happen to me? It's not even fair. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN So the sadness and the lonliness but then angry at him and even angry at yourself. In previous sessions, we talked about how messages we give, give ourselves, we call them negative self talk, trigger emotional reactions. Thoughts influence feelings. So if you can identify the thoughts that are behind the feelings and you can evaluate them to see if they're reasonable and realistic. If you change the thoughts, you change the feelings. Now in the past, we've seen that your thoughts are very heavily biased in the negative direction. But if you can change the thoughts that triggered the event, triggered by an event, then you can also alter the feelings too. So let's look at the connections between your thoughts and your feelings. You said that you were feeling angry and depressed, right? 

00:30:20
MARIA Exactly. I can hardly get up in the morning to go to work. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Okay, I hear what's going on there for you. Let's identify some of the thoughts that have accompanied those feelings. You said Carlos was a liar and a fake, right? 

00:30:30
MARIA Right. 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN So that's one of the thoughts that's triggering the angry feelings. As we said, we want to make sure that we examine those thoughts and perhaps challenge them if they're not really working for you. Let me ask you, you would agree that Carlos wasn't all bad? 

00:30:50
MARIA No, he had some good qualities. 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN Of course he did. You can see that just labeling him in a globally negative way not only makes you angry, but it really just isn't true. 

00:31:00
MARIA Yeah, is that on that list of errors uhm, thinking errors that we talked about before? 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Yes it is. Uhm, overgeneralizing, also called polarizing. It's a tendency to see things in black or white terms. 

00:31:20
MARIA Yeah. I guess I'm doing that. 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Okay. So what would be a more realistic way to talk about Carlos? It's probably more complex, not simple black and white. Not just all good or all bad. 

00:31:35
MARIA I don't know. Uhm, he had some good qualities. 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN He had some good qualities that attracted you. 

00:31:40
MARIA Yeah. And he had some bad ones too. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN He had some negative qualities that just turned you off. 

00:31:50
MARIA Mmh hmm. Carlos was good to me sometimes and uh, and I think that's why I miss him. But uhm, now I see things that tell me, tell me to stay away from him, to back off. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN Good, okay. How does it feel to be thinking of it like that? 

00:32:10
MARIA Uhm, actually, he makes me feel a little calmer, uhm, a little more, I don't know, uhm, in balance maybe. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Okay, so you see how this works? 

00:32:25
MARIA Yeah, I do. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Okay, now let's look at some of the other self talk and how those feelings are connected. 

00:32:35
MARIA Okay. 

00:32:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, I thought this was a good demonstration of the uhm, you know the the fundamental steps and the cognitive restructuring process. 

00:32:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yeah, it's a complicated process. 

00:32:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE It is. I mean, he's, he's tying thought to feeling. Then we're identifying the kind of thoughts that are tied to depression. Then we're looking at alternatives. Then we're, you know, eventually going to take those alternatives and show how they can change the affect. He did all those things (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And even doing some bias identification. 

00:33:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. He (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Labeling some of that. 

00:33:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, and I think, I think what I would like to point out about this is that that usually takes several sessions. So this was kind of the demonstration that condensed all these things and uh, and I think it probably doesn't represent what actually happened. This usually takes uh, actually quite a bit of time to go through. But I think it demonstrates all those, and I thought that was well done. 

00:33:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. I really liked the way he attended to her in an emotional way. That he reflected her feeling. He didn't just not pay attention to it and well, we've got to move on and deal with the cognitive. He dealt with her affectively too, and that's important to build that relationship, those relationship factors are important in therapy. Powerful influencers of therapy. And, I think if you don't pay attention to that, you can run the risk of a patient not being satisfied with therapy at all, not being motivated to want to cooperate there. 

00:33:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I agree entirely. 

00:33:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And I hope building that alliance is an important part throughout therapy, not just at the beginning. But you have to stay in touch with that patient and keep them where they're at so stay in touch with them and stay in touch with their feelings. 

00:34:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I couldn't agree more. 

00:34:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:34:10
Behavioral Activation Therapeutic Interventions 1. Engage the client in "behavioral activation", increasing the client's contact with sources of reward, identirying processes that inhibit activation, and teaching skills to solve life problems; use behavioral techniques such as instruction, rehearsal, role-playing, role reversal, as needed, to assist adoption in the client's daily life; reinforce success. 2. Assist the client in developing skills that increase the likelihood of deriving pleasure from behavioral activation (e.g., assertiveness skills, developing an exercise plan, less internal-more external focus, increased social involvement); reinforce success. 

00:34:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE As a standalone empirically supported behavioral intervention, or as part of larger cognitive behavioral interventions, behavioral activation has shown to have a powerful positive impact on depression. Behavioral activation uses activity scheduling to increase the client's engagement in activities that have a high likelihood of providing pleasure and reward. Skills may be taught that help the client maximize opportunities for deriving reward through activities. The following vignette shows an example of a therapist working with a client to do just that. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Okay, Maria, uhm, have you gotten out to be much with your friends or to do some of your volunteer work at Big Sisters, or just do things like walking around the mall like you used to? 

00:34:55
MARIA No, I haven't felt like doing anything. I just don't seem to have that energy. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN Now Maria, as you know, and as we've been discussing, one of the things that you can do to be able to lift depression is to increase your level of activity. Being more active can help you to increase your just general sense of pleasure, help you to feel more useful, and build your confidence. I know it's difficult to get moving again, but I'd like you to try to start with some very small activities and build up to some more ambitious projects. Do you think you can try that? 

00:35:30
MARIA I'm not sure. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Well I know some of the things that you've enjoyed doing in the past, but I'd like you to look at this list. It's over a hundred different pleasurable things that you can do to help get yourself moving again. I want you to look it over and take it home. Complete a homework assignment with it. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:50
Next Session 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Okay Maria, did you pick some of the activities out from the list for your homework assignment? 

00:35:55
MARIA Mmh, I did, but it was tough. It took a lot of energy just to work on it. But it did remind me of some of the things I used to enjoy doing. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Okay, great. Good. I'm glad that you did that. Uhm, let's pick out just three activities that we can focus on. How about we take one from each category. So first, the positive social interactions category. What did you write down for that? 

00:36:25
MARIA Uhm, I wrote down going to the movies with my sister. She keeps asking me to go to the movies with her. Uhm, we used to have fun doing that. We always like that. 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN Perfect. Uh, now how about an activity from the useful events category. What did you put there? 

00:36:40
MARIA I picked, uhm, organizing my closet and drawers. Uhm, I keep putting that on the side, maybe because they're just always messy, and you know, I just didn't want to put up with that. It's always boring. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Okay, that's another good choice. Uhm, now what did you have in the category of intrinsically pleasant activities? Those are the things that you do just because they're fun to do. 

00:37:00
MARIA I know. Uhm, I picked getting my hair done, and uhm, just interacting with the people in the salon. I always love to, you know, when people make me feel pretty, and when I get my hair and my nails done it makes me feel pretty, so... 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Very good. Uhm, let's look at your schedule and, for this week, and let's see what you can commit to doing. 

00:37:20
MARIA All right. 

00:37:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. This was a good introduction to behavioral activation I thought, Tim. 

00:37:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I think it's, you know, uhm, I thought it's a clear cut kind of demonstration of what this technique involves. I think that uh, the therapist did a good job of explaining the rationale. I think, which makes it very understandable to the client. Why are we doing this? And uh, and I think you know, I think you have to do that. You have to engage him. So he was asking her, you know, do you think you can do this? Because with the depression, and the lethargy, and the fatigue and all this, this is asking a lot of clients. 

00:38:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And he indicated to her we're going to start with something simple. We're not going to be too complex here. 

00:38:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Graduated again. 

00:38:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yes, yes, because they're going to be resistant to this. 

00:38:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:38:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. I liked how he talked about the three categories of Lewinson here, getting her to pick one from each category, indicated first I'd like to see one from the positive social interaction, and then moved her into the second category. He covered all three of those categories of Lewinson and I think that's important to get that variety, because he's really shown that that's a good positive way to move people. 

00:38:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it's tied and Lewinson's concept is those kinds of activities are tied very strongly to affect. 

00:38:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. They do change mood. 

00:38:40
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE They change mood, so the more you can get them in there. Now he's done that very explicitly. Other therapists will just make sure they cover those things and not necessarily label them. You have all kinds of options. 

00:38:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Sure. Sure. 

00:38:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE But I thought this therapist also did something that's very important here because compliance is an issue with this, with depression. And so when he was getting to the point of, you know, setting up a, an activation, if you will, uh, they scheduled it. And that's a really good thing to do, saying, you know, next Tuesday let's put it in here, because it makes it less likely that someone's not going to be able to do that. And like I said, that's in my opinion a strong issue in depression. 

00:39:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Don't just say, well, why don't you try to work it in somewhere this week, but put it in the schedule. 

00:39:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Exactly. And he did that. And I thought that was excellent. 

00:39:25
Personal & Interpersonal Skills Training Short-Term Objectives 10. Learn and implement assertive communication skills. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Use techniques such as psychoeducation, modeling, and role-playing to teach client assertiveness skills; assign homework exercises; review and repeat toward improving the goal integrating their use into the client's life. Short-Term Objectives 11. Learn and implement problem-solving decision-making skills. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Use techniques such as psychoeducation, modeling, and role-playing to teach client problem-solving skills including defining problems, generating possible solutions, evaluating solutions, developing a plan, implementing the plan, evaluating the efficacy of the plan, accepting or revising the plan. 2. Help the client resolve depression related to interpersonal problems through the use of reassurance and support, clarification of cognitive and affective triggers that ignite conflicts, and active problem-solving. 

00:39:25
Short-Term Objectives 12. Learn and implement conflict resolution skills to resolve interpersonal problems. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Teach conflict resolution skills (e.g., empathy, active listening, "I messages", respectful communication, assertiveness without aggression, compromise); use psychoeducation, modeling, role-playing, and rehearsal to work through several current conflicts; assign homework exercises; review and repeat toward improving the goal integrating their use into the client's life. Short-Term Objectives 13. Participate in conjoint sessions to address interpersonal problems. Therapeutic Interventions 1. In conjoint sessions, help the client resolve interpersonal conflicts using interpersonal skills such as assertion, problem solving, and conflict resolution. 

00:39:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Nearly every identified EST for depression includes skills training to help improve the quality and satisfaction derived from interpersonal interaction. Examples of common skills that are trained include: conversational and assertive communication skills, problem solving and decision making skills, and conflict resolution skills. These skills are often taught to the client, practiced in session and then assigned as homework. In some cases, conjoined sessions may be used. This vignette shows a therapist taking her client through the steps involved in problem solving. 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN So Maria, you've mentioned uh, your frustration over conflicts with Sue at work. What's the issue there? 

00:40:15
MARIA I get so frustrated. Uhm, she's nasty. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Okay, so let's approach this as we discussed before. The first step is to define the problem specifically. Uhm, let's try that. Tell me how she's nasty. Think of specific examples. 

00:40:30
MARIA Uhm, well, she ignores me, uhm, every time I say good morning to her. I don't, you know, I don't see... Her desk is right next to mine, uhm, and she even looks away when I look at her. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:40:50
MARIA Plus she's always late to work. 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN Okay, let's take these one at a time. It sounds like one issue is the morning greeting problem. So what are your options to deal with this? 

00:41:00
MARIA I guess, I could just keep saying hello, being polite to her and see if there's any changes. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN So that's one option. Just keep doing what you're doing. How about others? 

00:41:10
MARIA Uhm, I could stop saying hello and just ignore her, just like she's ignoring me. Or I could just tell her off. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Okay, so those are two other options. Good. Others? 

00:41:20
MARIA I'm not sure. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN How about talking to her in a way that uh, shares how her behavior makes you feel sad and hurt? 

00:41:30
MARIA I guess. Uhm, doesn't she know that? 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Well, can you assume that she does? 

00:41:40
MARIA I guess not. Uhm, maybe she doesn't. 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Uh, let's go to the next step. Let's look at our four options and consider the pros and cons of each. First, first option was to just keep on doing what you're doing. What are the pros and cons there? 

00:41:55
MARIA Well, it could uhm, frustrate me even more. Uhm, I've been doing this for weeks, so no I don't think that's going to work. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN So more of the same just won't work. What about option two, ignoring her? 

00:42:15
MARIA That might uhm, lower my frustration, or some of my frustration and uhm, but it also makes the tension between us even bigger. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN So you might feel better a little bit but more tension. So I see what you're saying. How about confronting her with your anger about her behavior, just telling her off? 

00:42:35
MARIA I think I'll feel better. 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Any cons or drawbacks to that one? 

00:42:45
MARIA Well, I might feel better for a little while, but I think that will probably just make her mad and cause a bigger frustration, or a bigger problem between us. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Okay, then how about the option of sharing your feelings in a nonconfrontational, nonagressive manner? Telling her how her behavior hurts your feelings? What's the downside or the benefits of doing that? 

00:43:15
MARIA Well, uhm, it might take her by surprise if I tell her that I'm hurt. But, she could, or she could mock me uhm, but maybe it would start us by talking, you know? Start talking to each other. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN So, are you getting from all that a sense for the best option for you? 

00:43:40
MARIA Yes, uhm, talking to her would probably be better. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Okay, good. So let's role play how you might say this to her? 

00:43:50
MARIA Uhm, I'm not sure if I can do, do it right. Uhm, okay. Sue, I want to tell you something important. I feel so hurt when I say hello or good morning to you and you don't respond back to me. Uhm, that gets me, that makes me feel down. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN I think that's excellent. Uhm, you were not accusatory. You were clear about your feelings. Now, let's take it the next step further. Let's work on how you can follow this by discussing with her how the situation might be made better. Are you ready? 

00:44:30
MARIA Yes. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:30
MARIA Sue, I want to tell you something very important. Uhm... 

00:44:40
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Well I thought that was a good demonstration of the steps in problem solving. I mean, he helped her identify the problem, generating options, evaluating those options, making a decision about which option should go, you know, looking at the pros and cons, and then choosing one. I mean, where they're going to go is to uh, implement that and then uh, review how that went. 

00:45:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And their review's important for them to be able to process that a little bit, get the feelings associated with it, reinforce the success if there was success, and modify it a little bit, do some changing if we need to reimplement in the future. 

00:45:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, absolutely. 

00:45:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. I like the way he broke down this concept of, she's so nasty. Well what does it mean that's she's nasty? 

00:45:25
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE When they were defining what the problem was. 

00:45:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yeah, defining that problem and getting it down to something that was behaviorable, observable, and they did that nicely. 

00:45:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE And workable. 

00:45:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yeah, of course, she was a nice cooperative patient to give you that. That's where demonstrations are nice. 

00:45:40
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Well one of the things I think uhm, that's not shown here that you'll see in problem solving therapies, they'll sometimes integrate cognitive restructuring, and your observation uhm, lends itself to this. You know, in depressive thinking there's global, general, negative biases there to say somebody's just nasty. And what problem solving does is make you get more specific and reality based about that. So there's benefits to doing that, not only in facilitating problem solving but there's benefits, you know, in terms of the cognitive restructuring. And a lot of times therapists really work that. 

00:46:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. She's not all nasty. She does some other things that are probably pretty nice for her. But this is a problem here, that greeting in the morning and feeling ignored and that sort of thing. And then that final option that came up here was presented by the therapist to the client saying well you could maybe think about sharing your feelings with her. 

00:46:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE And that's what she went with. 

00:46:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yes. Yes. I was kind of hoping, maybe he could lead her to that a little more, let her develop that. But obviously later stages of therapy, sessions later, she's going to be the one to develop that final option. 

00:46:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE That's what you're working for. 

00:46:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Sure. 

00:46:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE That's a good observation. 

00:46:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:46:50
Interpersonal Therapy Short-Term Objectives 13. Identify important people in your life, past and present, and describe the quality, good and bad, of those relationships. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assess the client's "interpersonal inventory" of important past and present relationships and develop a case formulation linking depression to grief, interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, and/or interpersonal deficits. Short-Term Objectives 14. Participate in therapy toward the goals of understanding and solving the current interpersonal problems. Therapeutic Interventions 1. For grief, facilitate mourning and gradually help client find new activities and relationships to compensate for the loss. 2. For disputes, help the client explore the relationship, the nature of the dispute, whether it has reached an impasse, and available otions to resolve it, if the relationship has reached an impasse, consider ways to change the impasse or to end the relationship. 3. For role transitions (e.g. beginning or ending a relationship or career, moving, promotion, retirement, graduation) help the client mourn the loss of the old role while recognizing positive and negative aspects of the new role, and taking steps to gain mastery over the new role. 4. For interpersonal deficits, help the client develop new interpersonal skills and relationships. 

00:46:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Interpersonal therapy treats depression in its interpersonal context. Accordingly initial sessions are devoted to taking a detailed interpersonal inventory of important past and present relationships and formulating the patient's depression in interpersonal terms. Emphasis is placed on overcoming interpersonal loss and grief. Resolving interpersonal disputes, transitioning out of old and into new interpersonal roles, and developing new and more effective interpersonal skills.

Other Common Approaches Probing Unexpressed Anger Exploring an Abuse History in the Family Enhancing Motivation through "Stage-of-Change" Interventions Antidepressant Medication 

00:47:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Therapists working with depression have also commonly used other approaches that may be a part of the overall treatment plan. Examples include: probing unexpressed anger, or anger turned inward, exploring an abuse history in the family, enhancing motivation through stage of change interventions, prescribing or referring for antidepressant medication. 

00:47:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Whether treated pharmacologically, psychologically, or both, depression is prone to relapse. There has been some promising work developing formal relapse prevention programs for depression, some of which have received empirical support. Before reviewing those, though, let's take a look at some common considerations in relapse prevention and how they can be incorporated into your treatment plan. 

00:48:15
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:48:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. One of the first steps in relapse prevention interventions is to provide a rationale for them. This typically involves a discussion of the risk for relapse and how using the relapse prevention approach we will outline can lower that risk. 

00:48:35
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention that discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 

00:48:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this. 

00:48:40
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention Explain rationale of prevention interventions Distinguish between lapse and relapse Identify "high-risk" situations for a laspe Review the application of skills learned in therapy to high-risk situations Encourage routine use of skills Schedule periodic "booster" sessions 

00:48:40
Therapeutic Intervention 2. Discuss with the client the distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with a temporary setback and relapse with a return to a sustained pattern of depressive thinking, feeling, interpersonal withdrawal and/or avoidance. 

00:48:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Another early step in relapse prevention is to distinguish between a lapse and relapse. A lapse is presented as a not uncommon temporary setback that may involve, for example, re-experiencing a depressive thought and/or urge to avoid or withdraw. Perhaps related to some loss or conflict. Relapse on the other hand is described as a return to a sustained pattern of depressive thinking and feeling, usually accompanied by interpersonal withdrawal and/or avoidance. This component of relapse prevention can be captured in a therapist intervention such as this one.

High-Risk Situations Interpersonal Conflict No Assertive Approach; Self-deprecating Depressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Actions 

00:49:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Accordingly, high risk situations that might make the client vulnerable to a lapse are identified. This discussion may be informed by past difficult experiences or anticipated new ones. Some examples include having an interpersonal conflict after having not had one for some time, deciding not to use an assertive approach in a situation and then self deprecating, having a stressful day or week and starting to contemplate old depressive thoughts, feelings and actions. 

00:50:00
Therapeutic Interventions 3. Identify and rehearse with the client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur. 

00:50:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE For the high risk situations identified, the therapist and client rehearse how they can be managed using the skills learned in therapy, including the skill of developing a tolerance for occasional depressive thoughts and feelings while working on how to problem solve them. Identifying and rehearsing the management of high risk situations can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this one. 

00:50:25
Therapeutic Intervention 4. Instruct the client to routinely use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., cognitive restructuring, problem solving, behavioral activation), building them into his/her life as much as possible. 

00:50:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. In addition to using skills learned in therapy to manage high risk situations, clients are also encouraged to integrate positive thinking, communicating, problem solving and staying active in their day to day lives. Therapist intervention number four captures this emphasis in the treatment plan. 

00:50:55

00:50:55
Therapeutic Intervention 5. Develop a "coping card" on which coping strategies and other important information (e.g., steps in problem solving, reminders regarding assertive communication). 

00:50:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Sometimes clients benefit from having a coping card or other reminder of important strategies and information regarding relapse prevention. If you decide to use this aid, it can be captured in a treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as number five. 

00:51:15

00:51:15
Therapeutic Interventions 6. Schedule periodic maintenance or "booster" sessions to help the client maintain therapeutic gains and problem solve challenges. 

00:51:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Finally, there's evidence to suggest that periodic booster sessions of therapy can help prevent relapse of depression. So clients are invited to periodically revisit therapy to strengthen and reinforce their new approach to life and problem solve any difficulties. Treatment intervention number six describes the use of booster sessions in the treatment plan.

Formal Relapse Prevention Programs for Depression Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2001) Well-Being Therapy (Fava & Riuni, 2003) Cognitive-Therapy Continuation (Jarrett & Kraft, 1997) 

00:51:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. As we mentioned, there are some more structured relapse prevention programs derived from cognitive and cognitive behavioral therapies which have received some empirical support. They are: mindfulness based cognitive therapy, which combines mindfulness meditation with cognitive therapy techniques. It helps clients learn to recognize the negative thought processes associated with depression and change their relationship with these thoughts. MBCT has empirical support for its ability to reduce the risk of relapse in those with chronic depression. 

00:52:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Well-being therapy is designed to facilitate health after recovery from depression to reduce the risk of relapse. The therapy focuses less on symptom management and more on building strengths to foster mental health. In cognitive therapy continuation, clients learn to use emotional distress and depressive symptoms to practice the coping and other skills learned during active therapy and to generalize these skills to everyday life. For those interested in these programs, reference to their empirical support, clinical materials, and training opportunities are included in the workbook. 

00:52:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Today's discussion focused on empirically informing treatment plans using goals, objectives and treatment interventions consistent with those found in empirically supported treatments. These treatments must all be delivered within the context of an authentic empathic relationship. As you can see, there's a significant body of research in this area. The accompanied guide provides you with additional clinical resources as well as references to empirical support for the interventions we discussed today. 

00:53:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE We want to remind you that the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of empirically informed psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health and substance abuse problems. It's designed to be informative in nature and doesn't intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed or demonstrated. For those interested in learning more about the empirically supported treatments discussed, references to their empirical support, clinical training materials, and training opportunities are provided in the workbook. We hope this information will assist you in helping your clients live more happy and productive lives.
