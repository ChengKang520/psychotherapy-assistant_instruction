RICH SIMON Okay, so, for those of you who read "The Networker", or regularly attend the symposium, I think, by now, I've established my credentials as a typically hyperactive, work-obsessed, New Yorker. I admit it. I'm a big city boy who thinks a cluster of more than six trees in one place constitutes a primeval, old-growth, forest, but when I'm speaking with Mary Pipher, which is something I try to do as often as possible, my secret inner-Nebraskan somehow begins to come up for air. In the middle of, wh-, what I think should be a business call to get things done, to iron out details, Mary will start describing, to me, how beautiful the sky is, or what birds she saw in her garden that morning or the way the fall leaves swirl in the wind, and frankly, just between you and me, when I first got to know Mary, I often, to, thought to myself, "What is this woman talking about? What birds? What leaves? What sky?" But after 15 years of our unlikely friendship, she's begun to wear off on me. These days, after one of our regular existential check-ins, I'm likely to sneak a peek out at the clouds floating by and notice that there is a sky out there. That miraculously, there are trees just on the other side of my window. I think she has that impact on a lot of people. Helping us tune into what really matters, what is most deeply rooted in our being, and, that is often disguised by this frenetic daily grind of getting, doing, pursuing, competing. Now, of course, this is not the first time that I've had the honor of introducing Mary at this conference, and to make my job a bit easier this time, I'd like to take us back 15 years to the first time that Mary addressed this group, right after I had flown out to her home in Nebraska and experienced the hospitality of Mary and husband Jim in Lincoln, Nebraska to interview her for a network or profile and you'll see my introduction and I get, uh, a little help at the end from a very dear friend of mine. And when I went out to, uh, Lincoln, Nebraska to interview her, I learned her secret. She and her husband Jim, not only talk about understanding what's important in life and when enough is enough, but they actually put their principles into practice. They are the antidote to "Martha Stewart Living".

RICH SIMON They still use the same bathroom towels that they received as a wedding gift. By now, those bathroom towels look like a very large Kleenex, that, that has been run over repeatedly by a steamroller, but they still work. Mary's books are wonderful but you can learn a lot about life from her bathroom towels. 

00:03:15
BILL DOHERTY Mary, I hope you don't mind that (crosstalk) I share something with the group. We, we've, gotten very close, the three of us, the four of us. Um, when you all were laughing at the Martha Stewart line, Mary turned to me and said, "Who's Martha Stewart?" 

00:03:35

00:03:45
RICH SIMON Now, of course, far be it from me to cast any aspersions on Martha Stewart, but she and Mary do seem to come from two different planets. If not entirely from two different universes. In a very real sense, Mary Pipher remains an antidote, not just to "Martha Stewart Living", but to the selfishness, the mass consumerism, the preoccupation with status, the obscene pursuit of money, the sheer wretched excess which seems so prevalent in our society these days. When we were planning this symposium on creating a new wisdom, it was immediately apparent that we could not have a conference on wisdom without having Mary, Kif-, Pipher, come and speak, so please join me in welcoming to this stage a great friend of "Psychotherapy Networker" and this meeting, Mary Pipher.

MARY PIPHER Hello. Congratulations, Rich, on 35 years, ya know, um, I still have those same towels. I haven't replaced 'em yet. You should see 'em now. It makes me very happy to be with this tribe. I noticed Rich used the metaphor of tribe too. I've been coming, if you noticed, I had brown hair, when, in that shot, and, uh, my Ophelia was still a teenager, and she turned 35 years old yesterday, so, it's, it's, been awhile since I've been with this group of people. I thank you all for your kind attention to me all of these years. One thing I wanted to say, uh, I've used the metaphor of a family reunion to describe this group, but last night I was thinking, it kind of reminds me of the sun dances that we have in Nebraska for the different tribes, where once a year people come together to celebrate life and to tell their stories, so it seems like kind of a sun dance here, this morning, to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna, or, today, I'm gonna talk to you about the ideas in my ninth book, "The Green Boat, Reviving Ourselves in our Capsized Culture". In it, I examine our individual and cultural responses to global climate change. I struggled preparing this speech. Thank you, thank you. No one really wants to think about these overwhelming problems, and I also want every one of you to be happy and have a good experience when you listen to me, and with this topic, as you can imagine, that's a challenge. That's a real challenge. So I'm going to start with the most difficult material then I'm gonna move into more heartening information, so please stay with me. There will be a turning in this speech. Isaac Dennison wrote, "All sorrow can be born if it is put into a story." So I'm gonna begin by telling you my story. In the cataclysmic summer of... 

00:07:25
(inaudible ) 

00:07:30
MARY PIPHER I experienced what environmentalists call the "Oh Shit Moment". At that time, the earth was experiencing its warmest decade, its warmest year, and the warmest April, May, and June on record. In Pakistan, it was 129 degrees, in Russia it was 111. For the first time in memory, uh, lightening was igniting fires in the peat bogs of Russia, and these fires spread to the south as doctors from Moscow road to rescue heat and smoke victims, they fainted in their un-air conditioned ambulances. In July, the heat index in Lincoln, where I lived, reached 115 degrees for several days in a row. Our planet and all living beings seemed to be gasping for breath. In, that, same month, I read Bill McKibben's "Eaarth", spelled, E-A-A-R-T-H, in which he argues that the earth, as we know it, has already vanished. He postulates we now live on a new planet, earth, with a rapidly changing ecology. He argues that without immediate action, our familiar ways of life will disappear. Not in our grandchildren's adulthoods, but in the lifetimes of middle age people, like us here today. He writes that we don't have 50 years to save our environment, we had the next decade. None of my experiences had quite prepared me for the bleakness of earth. I couldn't stop reading it, and when I finished, I felt shell shocked. For a few days, all I could experience was despair. Everything felt so hopeless and so over. During this time, my grandchildren came to visit and as we picked raspberries, I thought about all the care we lavish on these children. We make sure they eat healthy foods and brush their teeth with safe toothpaste. We treat and examine every little scratch and bite and yet we, and by, me, we, I mean all the grandparents of the world, including myself, hadn't worked hard enough to secure them a future with clean air and water and a diverse, healthy, ecosystem. Had I been in a trance? That summer, when I, talked, listened, to my friends talking about the ordinary details of life, I wanted to shout at them, "Wake up. Please wake up. Our old future is gone. M-, matters, are urgent. We have to do something now." But after years of being a mother and a therapist, I've learned that shouting "wake up" doesn't work. In fact, that was one of my most dispiriting realizations. I wanted desperately to preserve the world I loved but I didn't even know how to share this fact with my closest friends. One night my daughter and her family were over for dinner, during, uh, uh, just a torrential, r-, record breaking, rainfall and after the baby went to sleep we sat and watched the wind, thr-, whip through the pines, and, and, listened to it hammer our windows and Sara asked Jim and me if, uh, we thought the rain was related to global climate change. We looked at each other, we were too confused to speak. We didn't know what to say to her. My wonderful daughter had the dreams of all mothers for her children. She was already doing her best. I couldn't bare it, to inflict any pain on her. However, Sara was persistent and so, in the most calm and positive way, I told her what I had recently read. She was devastated. She and her husband bundled up the baby and said goodnight. I could see her weeping as she tucked Coltrane into his car seat. I felt anguished, and I wasn't sure I had done the right thing. Yet Sara was 33 years old, could I really shield her from what scientific experts were telling us? Would I want to be protected from the truth? Wasn't it better if we faced these things together? Uh, that next week, my despair was intolerable. I couldn't enjoy anything. My conversations with my husband quickly fell into what we call, "The dumper". I was afraid to be around friends for fear I would infect them with my gloominess. I knew I had to find a way out of my state of mind. I could not survive with that much awareness every minute of the day. I wanted to be happy again, and laugh, and snuggle with my grandchildren without worrying about their futures, yet I couldn't forget what I understood. What pulled me out of my despair was my desire to get to work. I didn't know what I was gonna do. I felt virtually unqualified for everything involving the environment but I knew I had to do something. It was unclear how much my action would benefit the world, but I knew it would help me. I've never been able to tolerate stewing in my own anxiety. Action has always been my healing tonic. So I invited a group of people to my house to discuss what we could do to stop TransCanada from shipping tar sands sludge through our state via the keystone XL pipeline.

00:13:25
MARY PIPHER It just turned out we were very lucky in our location. Nebraska is the hub of the wheel on which the giant, global, battle about energy is being fought, and, um, so, we called ourselves the coalition, and for over a year we've met in living rooms for potlucks and planned actions. By the way, we made sure our meetings were parties. None of us had time for extra tedium or suffering and we wanted to enjoy what we were doing, so we always had really good food, and wine, and lots of laughter, and hugs. We ended our meetings when we were feelin' good and had a plan for the next couple of weeks. On the other hand, if you wanna know how the world works, try to change it, especially if the changes involve confronting the fossil fuel industry. Our campaign has been a complicated story about money, power, international corporations, and politics, but it's also a simple story about my friends and me working to save our state from what we call the "extra-leaky pipeline". Over the year we massified a term I use to signify momentum and increasing number of people onboard. We had rallies, educational forums, music benefits, booze at the farmer's markets and county fairs. By the summer of 2011, our entire state had united around stopping the XL's route through the Sandhills and over the Ogallala aquifer. Yes. And in fact, something even more interesting, from my point of view, happened than that, which was, this campaign ended up being the best thing to happen to Nebraska since Big Red Football. Progressives and western ranchers worked together. I've got a friend who's a lawyer for the Sierra Club, he went out to some V.F.W. to give a talk in a little western town. In some of those western communities in Nebraska, you can't admit you're a democrat, let alone and environmentalist, and he was getting standing ovations from places that probably would never have spoken to him before. We had tractor brigades into Lincoln and we had poetry readings all across the state. What all of us had in common was our desire to protect the place we loved. Our, uh, our, um, icon of this movement, by the way, was a, uh, tall guy, wore a, cowbea-, cowboy, hat, potbellied. He, he, really was our John Wayne and, um, conservative, rancher, he'd run, a, uh, what we call, a, uh, sale barn, an auction house, before he retired, and, um, he's, one time he was speakin' at a rally, Randy's his name, and he said, "This is not a political issue. There is not red water, there is not blue water. There is clean water or dirty water." And that's what we were able to do. Very important. Now in January 2012, Obama denied a permit because of concerns about Nebraska, but the outcome, if you're reading up on this at all is still very uncertain. We celebrated, we broke open champagne that day, but then we went back to work. One of our members is a guy named John Hansen, head of the Farmer's Union, and he said, "Working for a cause is not like planting corn, you don't throw some seeds in the ground and walk away, it's like milking cows, you do it every day for the rest of your life." You can never ignore it. Ya know, I wanna say something else about this coalition. It's not about the odds of success. We're not attached primarily to results. Of course, we wanna stop the pipeline but, especially when we started, we didn't think we had a chance. There were 12 people in my living room fighting one of the largest most powerful corporations in the world and a government that had never denied a pipeline permit. So, we, we, had very little expectation that we would succeed. We did it because it was the right thing to do and we could not let our state be destroyed without a protest. Our reward, our reward, for this work has been a sense of empowerment and membership in what Martin Luther King called "a beloved community". From this work, I learned that saving the world and savoring the world are not polarities, but deeply related. In fact, I know many of you know this, I'm in a ballroom full of, ac-, activists, and if you wanna talk more about, the, the, coalition, and, and, activism and how you can get started, I have a workshop right after this with, uh, Harville Hendrix and Dan Siegel. I think it's an open workshop, you're welcome to come. George Orwell argued that pessimism is reactionary because it makes the very idea of improving the world impossible. I found that whether or not we believe we can change the world, even in a small way, acting as if we can is the healthiest emotional stance to take in the face of injustice and destruction.

MARY PIPHER This speech has, roughly, three sections and that was the, ha-, that was the toughest one. Soren Kierkegaard wrote, "He who fights the future has a dangerous enemy." Life is very stressful. We think something is wrong with us but the problems are endemic and systemic. As a people, we have lost our grounding in deep time and place. Our problems are at root relationship problems. We have a disordered relationship with the web of life. Right now, the more we connect the dots between the events, the more frightened we are. In fact, this reminds me of a little story. I had my three grandchildren camping on our land in a little tent, this is about two years ago, and Kate, at that time, was eight, Aiden was six, and Claire Anne Elise was four. So, we're out in this little tent and, we're, we're, gonna sleep out all night, and, you know, we're only, like, 30 feet from the house, but the, oth-, the two-est, youngest ones, they are so excited and we're listening to the cicadas and we're listening for the peepers over on the lake, the frogs, but Kate kept going, "Nana, I'm scared, I wanna go back to the house." The oldest, so I chided her and I go, "Kate, you're the oldest, you should be braver and set a good example for your younger sister and brother." And, sh-, you know, "why are you scared?" and she goes, "Nana, they're too little, they don't know enough to be scared." Neither individuals nor cultures can keep up with the pace of change. Recently, I was telling these same grandchildren about all the things that didn't exist when I was a girl. Uh, I mentioned television in my remote area, cell phones, the internet, cruise control, texting, computerized toys, laptops, video recorders, microwaves, the list was so long that my grandson, Aiden, asked me at the end, "Nana, did they have apples when you were a girl?" 

00:21:45

00:21:50
MARY PIPHER We're bombarded by too much information, too many choices, too much complexity. Our problem solving abilities, our communication and coping skills have not evolved quickly enough to sustain us. All of us find ourselves rushed, (ph) stressed, fatigued, and upset. On all levels, international, national, personal, many situations seem too complicated to be workable. As a friend of mine, who's a school administrator, said recently to me, "Sometimes, sometime in the 1990s, problems stopped being solvable." And another friend put it this way, "There are no simple problems anymore." In addition to the problems we can describe and label, we have new problems we can barely name. Writers are coining words to try to describe our new set of emotions. For example, Glenn Albrecht, coined the term Solastalgia, to describe home-sickness or melancholia when your environment is changing all around you in ways you feel are profoundly negative. Joanna Macy, uh, uses the term "planetary anguish" to describe our own pain, but also the pain of the earth and the animals suffering all over the world. On the other hand, even though we all want to help, all of us also feel like we have enough on our plates without taking on the melting polar ice caps. One night, Jim and I were talkin' this summer, and this is when I'd been writin' this book for a long time, living with these issues for a couple years, and meanwhile, that week, we, had, had, just, sort of, an astounding death of many of our major appliances. A tree had hit our heater, air conditioner, our dishwasher had stopped working, our refrigerator, the temperature control was out of whack, and so Jim invited me, let's sit down and have a glass of wine before dinner. And I go, "All right, as long as we don't have to talk about global climate change. I said, I, I'm, not even up for a conversation about anything related to that." and Jim goes, "I'm not even up for a conversation about the state of our appliances right now." So, we all have that. The other thing I want to say about, the, the, issue is the scope and scale of this are so enormous that they really exceed our human and cultural resilience systems. Thinking about this issue is like trying to count two billion pinto beans. Often times, we don't know how to respond so we don't respond. We have a, kind of, a learned helplessness response but our sense of powerlessness becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. In "States of Denial" by Stanley Cohen, he writes about German and the denial of the Holocaust. He talks about a very interesting psychological state that many Germans were in at that time. He calls it a state of knowing, not knowing, that arises from ongoing traumatic situations. He said, "This willful ignorance occurs when information can neither be totally denied nor totally processed. It's a knowing, not knowing." And that is the state most of us are in. Like, for example, this year, in Nebraska in January we had some 70 degree days. Now, a lot of, we had one January, not too long ago when the temperature never got above zero, so this was very unusual weather, and I'd be going around to the grocery store, running into people at the post office, and they'd go, "Oh, isn't this weather wonderful?" and then, they, they'd, say, that, that, was the not knowing part. Then they'd say, "But it sure wasn't like this when I was a kid." There was, there was, always that, kind of, funny, isn't this great, but, what is this, really, we're talking about? Uh, we live in a culture of denial. The Pew Research Poll of December, 2011, revealed that in spite of increasing evidence, belief in climate change is at its lowest level since 1997. In fact, its decreased from 71% to 57% in the last year, and I think that's because, as information gets more alarming, denial becomes stronger. It makes perfectly sense. The better, stronger, the scientific evidence is, the more likely we are to see this increase in denial. In fact, even the way we talk about this is odd. We talk about believing in global climate change, uh, as if we're talking about believing in extraterrestrials, as opposed to respecting a body of scientific evidence. Partly these numbers reflect a well-funded, orchestrated, misinformation campaign by the fossil fuel industry, and at Stanford right now, there's actually a scientist whose new field of study is called Agnotology. Has anyone in this room heard of Agnotology? It's the study of ignorance that is deliberately manufactured or, p-, politically generated. We have a lot of it around. Many people report, um, lack of interest in this topic, but Renee Lertzman has done some very good research which she wrote up in an article called "The Myth of Apathy". She interviewed people and found that they care intensely about the environment but their emotions are so tangled up and upsetting that they are beset by internal conflicts, and, and, struggle to find a way to adapt. They're not apathetic, but they're in a, kind of, a psychological paralysis. Furthermore, all cultures have rules about what can and can't be discussed. There's an old joke that comes from the Soviet Union, two K.G.B. men were walking down the street and one of 'em says to the other, "What do you think of this system?" The other one, very cautious goes, "Well, I don't know. I probably think about the same thing you do." and the first agent said, "In that case, I'm going to have to arrest you." 

00:28:25
[sil.] 

00:28:30
MARY PIPHER Dr. Kari Norgaard has written, "The denial of global warming is socially constructed. In America, it's almost as if relevant information is classified. Our national policy toward the devastation is don't ask, don't tell. Now, part of this is so understandable. Everyone in this room wants to be able to have a shrimp cocktail without thinking about ruined mangroves, or read a book about lions to children without wondering how many lions are left. Yet, we cannot solve a problem we will not face, and with awareness, everything is possible. Thank you. Once we can face these hard truths about our environmental collapse, we begin a process of transformation that I'll call "The Alchemy of Healing". Despair is often a crucible for growth. As we expand ourselves to deal with this new normal, we can begin to feel more vibrant, empowered, and engaged with the world as it is, and we can practice, wh-, what, I call creative awareness, which is to think about this issue when we're shopping, when we're planning a trip, when we're working in our communities. We can be citizens of the world rather than consumers and vote every time we pull out our debit card. Belief follows action. The harder we work, the more likely we are to experience hope and to improve our situation, but now, I wanna talk about other way to achieve transcendence, to deal with the despair that is a realistic response to the situation we're in, and I guess the first, um, alternative I would offer you to action is amazement. Amazement is a wonderful antidote to despair. It took me a long time to learn that being miserable does not alleviate the world's misery, said Hannah Tennant-Moore. All of us have the gift of wonka tonka, the "big mysterious" as the Lakota Sioux would say, and I was aware of this one time. I was writing this book, I'm a caretaker now for a very ill sister and, that's, a lot of dealing with, uh, being on hold to the government and social security and, lotsa, lotsa, red tape, lotsa doctor's appointments and stress around money and insurance. So, anyway, I'd been dealing with that, I'd been dealing with the thorny issues and how to talk about, um, the issues, an-, the green boat, and, um, I just, I realized, I need a break. I need a morning when I'm not in the thick of it. So, I went out to the prairie and it happened to be a morning there were some bird watchers out there and I walked along with them for a while, and then, I realized I don't wanna hear anymore words. I don't wanna hear any more talk. So I just parted from my friends and, I, I, just went and, it was, it was, like, um, maybe March, last year because the grasses were, very, very tall, but, but, they were, they were, golden and brown and red, and I laid down in this grass, and I just, I felt the earth underneath me, and I could look up through these beautiful, glass, grasses, at the sky and there were some geese, geese goin' over, headin' North, and it was like that is what I needed, and that is what we all have. You may not have very many prairies if you live in Washington D.C. or if you live in New York City, but the sky is with us everywhere, and as one of my friend's said, "I've never seen an ugly sky." I was with one of my, another great antidote, of course, is just presence, just being where you are and being open to joy. I was with one of my friends one day, we'd walked around this little lake by my house with her little dog Leo, and when we got back to the car, um, Leo just, went crazy with joy. He just started rolling in the grass and kicking his legs up in the air with his back, kind of, squishing in the grass, and Margie said to me, "If you want to know what time it is, ask a dog. He will tell you it's now, now, now. 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:25
MARY PIPHER And finally, perhaps the most important way to achieve, um, some kind of transcendence, or ledge above the difficulties we're in is what I call "the moral imagination", developing a greater moral imagination. I define that as the ability to understand how the world looks and feels to all living beings. It involves heart, motivation, and imagination, and from my point of view, this 's my core value, it leads to a very simple value system. Good is that which increases the moral imagination of myself or anyone I come in contact with, and of course, that's what therapy is, to a great extent, moral imagination work, helping people with that, and evil is that which decreases it, which, of course, hate speech, so many things right now, we could think of, for that, and, um, the purpose of life is to grow one's own moral imagination and help others grow so that our circle of caring, which begins when we're young with our families, eventually includes all living beings. Now, I have a little story about the progression, thank you, thank you. So, I have this cute little song, and there's a book on, it's called "Hey Little Ant", have any of you seen it? It's really, it's by Linda and Phillip H-O-O-S-E, anyway, what it is, is a, is a, a song where this little boy is on a playground and he's gonna squish an ant and he and the ant have a dialogue about this, cuz he has all the, he wants to squish the ant, his friends are watching him, he thinks it's fun, and the little ant is saying well I have a family too and I have, from my point of view, I wanna stay alive, I have reasons to stay alive, and then the chorus is, "Should the ant get squished, should the ant go free, it's up to the kid, not up to me, we'll leave that kid with the raised up shoe, now what do you think that boy should do?" So I played this song to my grandchildren and Kate and Aiden, the two older ones, very good children, they go "Oh, nana, I will never squish an ant again. I will never squish an ant again." They're totally, they're totally, their moral imaginations very well developed, but the little one, Claire Anne Elise, isn't saying anything, so I go, "Well Clare, what about you?" and she thinks a little minute and she's, uh, honest, ya know, and she thinks a minute and she goes, "Well, nana, I promise I won't squish any talking ants." 

00:36:25

00:36:30
MARY PIPHER So she has room for growth, but... 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:40
MARY PIPHER Pablo Neruda wrote, "We are each one leaf on the great human tree." And I would extend that, we are, um, we are each one leaf on the great tree of all living beings. Dealing with global climate change is, essentially, an ethics problem. If we do not expand our moral imaginations, we'll destroy ourselves. Healing involves re-weaving the most primal of connections to the sacred web of life. Inner connection can be seen as a spiritual belief, especially in Buddhism, as Thich Nhat Hanh writes, "We enter our." But it's also a scientific fact, Dan could tell you that, Dan Siegel. Jeremy Rifkin writes, "We are learning that the earth functions like an invisible organism. We are the various cells of one living body and those who work to save the earth are its antibodies." At its core, interconnection is a survival strategy, Gregory Bateson knew this in the sixties when he wrote, "The unit of survival is the organism and his environment." The next great human rights battle will be a fight to rescue our beleaguered planet. It will be about air, plants, water-gy, energy, and dirt. We have a right to a sustainable planet and a future for our grandchildren. 

00:38:20

00:38:25
MARY PIPHER And the meadowlark has this right, and the fox, and the bull snake, and the mosquito in the cottonwood. We are in a race between human consciousness and the physics and chemistry of the earth. We can equivocate, we can politicize, but the earth will broker (ph) no compromises. In our great hominid journey, nobody really knows what time it is. We could be at the end, or we could be at the beginning of a great and glorious turning towards reconnection and wholeness. We who are alive today share what Martin Luther King called "The inescapable network of mutuality". We are not without resources, we have our intelligence, humor, compassion, our friends and families, and our ancestry of resilient hominid survivors. We can be restored. Since the beginning of time, how many people have loved and cared for each other so that we could be alive here today? How many fathers have hunted and fished, fought off predators, and planted grain, so that we could be breathing at this moment. How many mothers have nursed babies and carried water so that we could savor our small slice of time. We will never know the significance of our individual actions, but we can act as if our actions are significant. That will only create good on earth and, besides, what is the alternative, really? As Martin Luther King wrote, "If I knew the earth would fall to pieces, I would still plant a tree today." So let us save and savor the world together. I wish you well on your journey. I wish you vitality and hope. I wish you, your loved ones, and all living beings, long and happy lives. So be it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
