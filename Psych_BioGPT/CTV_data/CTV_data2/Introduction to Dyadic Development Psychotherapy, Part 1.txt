ROBERT And Dan Hughes is a clinical psychologist who resides in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, with an office in nearby Annville. After receiving his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Ohio University, he fairly quickly began specializing in the treatment of emotionally wounded children and youth with serious psychological problems from childhood trauma and attachment disorganization. Not having much success helping these children with traditional treatments, Dan developed an attachment-focused treatment that relied heavily on the theories and research on attachment. Dan resided for 30 years in Maine until moving to Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He has three daughters and one granddaughter, and he's the author of several books, including "Building the Bonds of Attachment," and "Attachment-Focused Family Therapy." He has provided training and consultations to therapists, social workers and parents throughout the US, Canada, UK, and Australia, and he provides regular training at Colby College in Maine, Annville, Pennsylvania, and London, England. He's also a visiting tutor for a graduate program in London. By now, you're probably thinking, "When is this man going to get busy and do something with his life? And today you will get a chance to hear."

ROBERT Art has received his MSW from the University of Maryland, at Baltimore and his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland's Institute for Child Study. He's achieved diplomatic status in child psychology and forensic psychology from the American Board of Psychological Specialties. He's a registered clinician with ATTACh. Art has been treating families of adoptive and foster children for over two decades as Director of The Center for Family Development. He consults with departments of Social Services, residential treatment centers and mental health clinics throughout the US, Canada, Singapore and elsewhere. Dr. Becker-Weidman is on the board of ATTACh, serves as Vice President for Clinical Issues, is on the Research Committee and the Training Committee and chairs the Registration Committee. He's an adjunct clinical professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Art has published over a dozen papers in peer-reviewed professional journals and is a co-editor of the book "Creating Capacity for Attachment," published in 2005 and reprinted in 2008. He's finishing work with Deborah Shell in Vermont on a book about attachment facilitating parenting that is expected to be published soon. Umm… Art is on the board of the Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy Institute and is a certified therapist, consultant and trainer of dyadic developmental psychotherapy. So you're probably thinking other than all that what are his qualifications? Well, you can put that question directly to Art today. Let me introduce Dan Hughes and Art Becker-Weidman.

ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Thanks, Robert. Okay. Good morning, everybody. Felt like I've an oxygen tent thing here following me around. Umm… I'm just gonna give you a quick overview of what we're gonna do this morning then Dan's gonna talk about some material. Umm… those of you who heard me before, I always like to do a little lottery for our presentation. So does anybody here have a cell phone, pager, beeper? Anybody? How many people? Okay, good. The way this works is umm… the first one whose cell phone, pager or beeper goes off, in the morning, will take us out to lunch. And in the afternoon, you have another chance to win. They will take us out for a drink. So if you want to play turn the volume up really loud so we can hear it please. Okay. Umm… this is what we'll be covering. In the morning, we're gonna go over some basic ideas and give you an overview of umm… attachment focused therapy, dyadic developmental psychotherapy, umm… focusing on attachment intersubjectivity. We'll describe some of the basic principles for you. Umm… give you an overview of the techniques and methods, and then discuss some of the stages. We'll talk just very briefly about some of the research basis for this model, and then the afternoon, after lunch, will primarily be Dan and I showing clips of DVDs to exemplify the concepts that we're gonna talk about in the morning. And the way we've got that organized, we'll show the DVD, talk about it and then you will have lots of opportunities to ask questions or make comments. And so that's basically the structure for the day. This kind of gives an outline. We'll give you the model. We'll talk about the principals. Use of self is very important in this model unlike some other models. How you use yourself is key. Parents, you will see as we talk about the model throughout the day and as you look at the videotapes, parents really are the keystone and lynchpin to success. That will be really very clear. Umm… and then this is the afternoon… We will talk a little bit, perhaps right before lunch about the certification process for those who might be interested in becoming a certified dyadic developmental psychotherapy therapist. And on the table back there, there's some information about the institute and some other stuff that you can help yourself with. Umm… before I turn it over to Dan, this is a slide that I'd just like you to look at. By the way, the PowerPoint slides are on the CD if you buy that CD from the Resourceful Recordings, and also, the PowerPoint presentation will be on the member's only site for ATTACh. So if you are a member of ATTACh, you can go up there and you will be able to download the entire PowerPoint presentation. If you're not a member of ATTACh, you may want to join because you get access to all kinds of material. Not only this, but lots of other good material. But this particular slide I like a lot because it highlights the importance of the alliance, the alliance with the parents and the child, and then everything starts with that. Thinking in terms or using an attachment model, without an alliance, you can't have a secure base. You need to develop an alliance to create the secure base. The secure base is what's required for exploration, right? Children, when they have a secure base, can explore their world. Adults who feel safe and secure can learn and move on with things. Exploration is required for integration and integration is the essence of what healing is. But it all starts with alliance, and so you can kept that in mind as we go through the day. So at this point, I will turn it over to Dan and we'll talk a bit about the concepts and ideas of DDP. 

00:07:20
DANIEL HUGHES Okay. Well, Art and I have a busy day with you, so… I start to get on… get… free from this… There it is, there you go. Okay. Yeah, it's busy, 'cause we've a lot to cover and… about this model of therapy and… and then show some tapes, which we'll be doing this afternoon. There we go. Let's starts… Obviously, it's an attachment focused model of therapy because when, uh… when I realized I wasn't helping the kids over 20 years ago that I was working with, I had to understand why I wasn't helping and this model just jumped… this theory jumped in. It was so obvious. And then the question is, "Why wasn't one therapist using that theory? That's 'cause basically the turf was already taken by psychoanalytic theory and cognitive behavioral theory and then medicine theory of… medication theory. So there wasn't room for a new theory. But there's no way it's gonna be kept out, because it's not the dominant theory of child development in the world. So eventually it has impact therapy. There's no way it can't. So this is one bridge to that. This is sort of a summary of what researchers say. Attach safety is… As I mentioned, safety is where it begins. You have to be safe, you're not gonna learn anything, you're gonna be dead actually. Then you need care-givers' available, sensitive, responsive, which is what Mary Ainsworth said in 1950 or so, and then people started adding. The other two bids are equally important, and in fact, maybe even important. Available, sensitive and responsive isn't… It doesn't last long unless you have repair, interactive repair. Every relationship has to be repaired continuously or it falls down. Either breaks and ends, or it becomes very superficial and becomes a casual friend. It's not an attachment relationship. When we're talking about parents and children, the parent is responsible for repairing the relationship every time there's a break. It doesn't matter who caused the break. If the child caused the break by spitting at the parent, the parent is still responsible for repairing that break, because you're the adult, you're not the child. And the repair means the relationship is more important than any conflict, any problem. The relationship always is number one priority to maintain the integrity of the relationship. So I got to convince the parents. You don't say, "I'm not gonna talk to until you say… until you apologize", because then you are saying the behavior that requires an apology is more important than your relationship. And you're also saying the child has a responsibility to be the parent, which is to repair the relationship, and it's not fair. And number five, which is probably the most important of the four… of the five, is your own attachment classification. When they realized that you look at the research that the attachment classification of the parent, which is a representational measure, it's the mind of the parent, when we measure that using Adult Attachment Interview, that's a better predictor of whether or not the kid is securely attached in those other four variables, which are behavioral measures. Then there's no way then we can help kids with attachment problems or living with parents who are not securely attached themselves without really an uphill battle. And if we can facilitate attachment security in the parents, then we're much more likely to facilitate attachment security in the child. And if we're gonna facilitate the parents, we have to be securely attached ourselves, or we're at risk not to be able to facilitating the parents. So it really goes around and around, and attachment security is a crucial variable in helping human beings to develop attachment security. You can't do it very well unless you're able to do it for yourself, in your own life. Okay. And that's why we have to work. If I made one… well, I've made a few hundred mistakes, but the dominant mistake I made when I was developing this model, and over the years in working with these families, if I'm gonna make a mistake today, it's still the most likely one I make, is not pouring enough energy in helping the parents to be securely attached, to be able to move in, to be present when their kid is dysregulated. That… that's tends to be the first thing interferes with the treatment. If I start to pretend that's not an issue and put more pressure on the kid to change, when I haven't put enough pressure on the parent to change, it's a vicious circle and pretty soon it's a mess, and I'm including with the parent to put the problem in the kid rather than in the relationships that are need to be. All right. Okay. So as you saw in the first slide, safety is beginning of everything. Quickly after safety is exploration and exploration, the foundation of exploration is intersubjectivity, which is another theory closely related to attachment theory, overlapping it in mayor ways. That is the foundation of learning about the world, about self, about other people. Intersubjectivity is the main way human beings learn. The stuff about reinforcement and crap like… I'm sorry, stuff like that is fine for rats and pigeons, but not for human beings. It really doesn't work. In terms of babies, you know how a baby learns. They learn by looking into the eyes of the parent. The parent tells them with their eyes and their face and their voice, their gestures or expressions, the intensity, the rhythm of their movements, that the baby's lovable, adorable and special and wonderful and cute, and all those things. Well, that's how a baby knows about self and that's how a baby knows about the world. You look at the parent, you see a stranger, you look at the parent and the face of the parent tells you the meaning of the stranger. If the parent is scared, then the stranger is frightening. If the parent is relaxed and welcoming, then the stranger is a friend. The meaning in the world comes out, and the same about spiders and the same about cars, and anything in your environment that you interact with… What it means to you becomes what it means to the kid, it's the template. And that's intersubjectivity. The subjective experience of the parent defines, and pretty much the template of the child's experience grows out of that. This is a very, very fundamental thing that we overlook all the time, because my experience with this kid in therapy is gonna influence his kid's experience of self in therapy. This kid's experience of self originally is, "I'm bad, stupid, no good, awful", because that is the definition given to be by my abusers or my neglectors or the people who threw me away. Now the kid is in my office, and the kid is living with parents and the kid has horrible symptoms, and it's tempting to start to see the kid the way abuser did. "You're a bad kid, you're not trying hard enough, you're selfish, you're lazy." And if start seeing the kid that way, this kid can never change, that's the nature of intersubjectivity. He or she will rely on my experience if they are gonna change. And my experience to them has to be something positive or this kid will never move into a new way of experiencing self. That's different than how they experience self by their parents, who abuse or neglected them. There's no… no possible way of doing it. Okay. So it's really crucial that I like my kids that I'm working with, and I like the parents, like in the fuller sense of the term. I have to find something about them that I really resonate with, I really have empathy for and enjoy and take delight in. I have to give myself a pep talk if necessary. When I open the door and go in the waiting room, I got to be ready to see this kid, because he or she will know if it's a job and if I'm not happy to be there today, and I'm doing it because I'm getting paid. They will know that within five seconds after in walk into the waiting room. That's my responsibility as a professional, to like the kids I'm working with, and like the parents… I got to like the parents as much as the kid or the parents won't be safe. Intersubjectivity is really the opening into helping human beings to change the experience of the events of their past. Or it's the door that slams on their face because this therapist experiences them the same way their parents in the past experienced them. You can't make it go away, it's there for better or worse and you really have to… Let me give you an example. Fifteen-year-old girl… I'll give you just a… 'cause we don't have time… adopted about six or seven, abused and neglect, really hard, now she's in a passive resistant, "In my room, leave me alone, shut up. I don't care, I don't know." That stupid type of relationship with people including, especially her parents. So… and so the parents are kind of worn out, decent people, really put energy into helping their kid to move along, but they really, really want out. She's 15 now and it's not seen any… there's no light on their horizon. So we're all sitting there and… we're sort of reviewing how it's going, and then in the middle of our meeting, most of the discussion was with me and the parents, she was listening. I brought her in once in a while, but I wanted to establish, "You're safe here, because your parents and I aren't gonna be judging you because I know they won't, 'cause I'll yell at them if they do", not quite. But they know how it works because that's my responsibility, to teach them how therapy works. It's not to give your kid a lecture and tell them to be good, that's not therapy. The therapy is different than that. So they got it. They may not have the greatest confidence, but they got it. So… uh, then I turned to the kid, and I started chatting with her and wondering to know about this, and wondering about this. You're give in… I don't want to go into the details and hopefully I'll cover that in the next hour. But, we're going through this and that, about her history and about this and how hard it's been and how scared she gets and confused she gets… And as kids will often do, if they get into the dialogue with you and they feel safe enough to, sort of, really go into their life with somebody who's not gonna judge it or evaluate it or threaten them. She started to cry. So she's sitting there crying, so I just got quiet and I just, sort of, got sad with her and experienced her despair over how hard her life has been. And then, boom, she started laughing. It was very sudden, very sort of unusual. I mean, it was just a sudden unpredictable laughing came, pretty intense laughing. So I waited till the laughing stopped, and I said, "I'm just curious, any sense of what that laughing was about?" At which point, she started laughing again, even louder the second time. So when she calmed down again I said, "Well, well, well, I'm sorry if I made you think that I wasn't happy about the laughing or don't think you should be laughing. I was just curious about it. It's fine that you're laughing. Any sense of what it's about though?" At which point her mother whispered to her father, who probably knew and it was probably more a whisper to me, but it was to… to the girl's father, her husband. "She does that whenever things gets too hard." Which is factually right. She does that whenever things get too hard, and it wasn't a bad statement. But it was a mild disappointment frustration statement that I read to mean she's not trying hard enough. At which point, my meaning… I mean, I'm just sort of absorbing it, that's my guess, but my guess is not important. To guess a child's experience of that is a million times more important than my experience or the mother's comment, whispering 'she does that whenever things gets too hard'. As soon as the mother whispered that to her husband, the girl just shrunk again, psychologically went into herself and just, sort of, went into shame and just sort of shrunk, went back behind her door, hiding there. So that this beautiful thing that was happening was just, boom, was gone. Intersubjectivity caused it to die, because the mom's experience of it, this isn't good enough, essentially, even though mom hadn't said that. And mom wasn't punitive, right? I think she just was disappointed and a bit frustrated. So… and it was a whisper, whispering isn't good. We know what whispering means. So I turned to her and I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't hear that." Which was a lie, but you're allowed to lie for good cause. So I said I didn't hear that. "Would you say that again please?" Because it's there, it's sneaky and it's insidious. You got to do something with that, you can't ignore it because the whole session just blew up in your face. So I said I'm sorry, "What did you say? Would did you say… would you say that again, please?" Not what did you say, that's a little judgmental, because I have to treat the parent the same way I want them to treat their kid. "I'm sorry, what did you say about… I didn't quite get it?" "She does that when everything has got too hard", and there it was again, the disappointment and frustration. So the kid is still shrunk, so I looked back and I said, "Oh, my goodness I am so sorry. Your mom knows you're so much better than I do. She knew it was getting too hard for you and I didn't know. I'm sorry." And now the kid looks at me, and she looks puzzled. And I'm giving it new meaning again. "Too hard" now means something different than how mom used the term too hard. And she started crying gain. So she's sitting there crying. So I reached out and held her hand, and I said, "I'm so sorry about that, because your life has been so hard and I've made it harder, haven't I? Too hard actually." So I turned back to mom and I said, "You know, mom, I don't think you and I, we ever realized how hard her life has been." At which point, mom started crying. At which point, I just sort of moved back and I said, "Your daughter needs to know that you get it, how hard her life has been." So mom gets up, moves over and puts her arms around her daughter and they are crying together. You see the power of intersubjectivity and the subtlety of it. And you could turn the meaning of the things in a split second. And our responsibility is to be able to see meaning in events that move people enter their vulnerabilities and strength safely, rather than with judgment, evaluation and… But I have to help mom to move too safely. I can't yell at her for being disappointed, that's not gonna help. I have to help both of them safely to go into that. Did I do that? Hasn't moved. Okay. I guess that… Did you do that, Art? You're saying I got to move it along? 

00:22:40
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN No, it's right there. 

00:22:40
DANIEL HUGHES Oh, is that right? I tell a lot of stories and I forget where I'm when I'm telling a story. They are true stories. Okay. Yeah, intersubjectivity. What's it about? Intersubjectivity has three features, otherwise you don't got it. You have to have shared affect, and (inaudible ) calls that attunement. You have to be in the same rhythm as the other person. Affect is a nonverbal expression of emotion. And if you are not a match for somebody in their affect, they don't feel you get it. Right I am? Right, there you go. Thank go, even New Yorker's match affect. It's just the only way to live. You got to match affect. And it's the only way to feel hurt. It's the only… It's a primary way we co-regulate affect. You get a kid who's starting to move to dysregulation. If your match their affect, they say regulated, as long as you're regulated. It's powerful, this matching affect of another person. When a kid is going, "There's a Sylvester(ph), but I really, really hate you. You're stupid", da-da-da. I got to match the affect. I got to say, "Oh, my goodness, you're really upset with me." How do you match affect? You match the tone of voice with the intensity and rhythm and your facial expression is the same, but you don't have the anger they have that motivated their affect. You don't have that emotion that led them into their affect expression of emotion. You go for the affect without the emotion, and it works beautifully. We do it with babies all the time. We forget how to do it with older people. We think lectures work, they don't work at all. We think that stern tone of voice works, nothing. They either disassociate or they spit at you. Lectures haven't worked in 20,000 years. So we really got to move on to a new way to educate people and teach people. Matching affect is number one. Okay. We got to teach parents how to do that. If you want a neat… a cute little tape on it, he doesn't understand what he's doing, but it's a good tape. His name is Harvey Karp, a pediatrician at UCLA, calls it the happiest father on the block. He's teaching parents how to match the toddler's affect, even though he calls it different words. Shared attention, it means we have to be focused on the same thing. So… 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:24:46
DANIEL HUGHES Am I talking too fast? 

00:24:46
UNKNOWN Yeah, (inaudible ). 

00:24:50
DANIEL HUGHES I only have a certain amount of time. I have to talk fast. You have to listen better. I'm sorry. Harvey Karp, K-A-R-P, he wrote two little books and two little DVDs, and Oprah Winfrey loves him. So, I mean, what else can you ask for. He's now a millionaire 'cause Oprah loves him and I get so jealous. I just want my interview with Oprah. Okay, shared attention. We have to focus on the same thing or you don't have subjective experience. If I'm saying "Hey, you hit your mom yesterday, and the kid's telling me about a bird out the window". We don't have anything going for us to, you know. He's avoiding focusing on the theme, whether it's trauma, whether or not it's a shame-based behavior, whether or not it's anything hard for him or frightening. I got to help him to find a way to focus on that. And hopefully, you will see some… in our tapes this afternoon, some examples of that. Because it's tricky, you can't yell at a kid, "Pay attention. This is important." You can't do that, Then you'll lose the intersubjective, when you get a kid have disassociated, who just says, "Yes, sir", or "I won't hit her again", which is nonsense. And the third is shared intention, uh, which is why we're doing this, why we're together here. We have to have complimentary motives, otherwise you don't have intersubjective. And complimentary motive is really crucial. You don't have an intersubjective thing, that's cooperation. We have the same intention here, it's complimentary, uh, with the kid I want to work with. So if my intention is to fix them, what's he's gonna do? Is he gonna say, "Great, fix me"? Probably not. So we've lost the kid then. If I'm working for Managed Care or working for a parent or a principle and my job is to make them… their live easier, the kid won't buy into that. He will turn down that joint motive in a heartbeat. So what motives is he likely to buy into? Probably something like, "I want to get to know you, and I want to enjoy being with you." That's about it. That's about all the motives I got. In doing that, as I get to know him the kid will start to open up about in his inner life, because he feels safe. He… Why is that gonna work? Because of what I got on my side, he's got the loneliest child in the world sitting next to me. This kid is desperate for somebody to get to know him safely, without judgment, without concluding he's a rotten, no-good kid. So I have to be able to find a way to do that. It's interesting, these three things. Without attunement, you have dysregulation of affects. Pretty soon, we're talking weird theories. Some people call these extremely weird theories, by bipolar disorder. You don't have… don't have matched affect. You can't regulate. You don't want to regulate affect unless you or your emotions are under the matched affect unless you have had this co-regulation through atonement. You don't do it. But that doesn't mean you weren't born. You were born with some sort of neurological, chemical imbalance. I'm not putting that down and saying it doesn't exist, but I'm saying, there's a heck of a lot more kids given that diagnosis than adults given, percentage wise, in adults. What happened to it? Do you grow out of it? What? Shared attention, when we don't have that, you have ADHD. Babies have extremely short attention spam, and that's five seconds, unless they're in the stance with a parent, then it lasts 30 seconds. The attention span expands through interactions with their parents. It happens all the time. If you don't get it, you don't develop your attention span. Again, you're probably not born with it. And majority of the kids aren't. And then shared the intention, what do we call the lack of that? We call it oppositional defiance. We haven't found a medicine to address that. Well, some people have, but in general… Okay, enough editorial comments. Oh, I already said this stuff. Oh, you move along there. We're moving along. Yes, there we go. Basic principles, self of the therapist. Why is that important? Okay. Our own history, I said that before. Boy, look like… skip a lot of this stuff. Yeah, we set our own history. I mean, that's very crucial. We got to look at it. That means we got to have reflective functioning. We got to be able to reflect on who we are as a therapist, as a person. It means we got to have colleagues that we can share with our tough cases. We got to have some good supervision. And if necessary, or at some point in our career and our lives, we probably ought to have some… some experience with some good therapist who has helped us to look at stuff that has been unresolved. So we have to be able to do the things we want our clients to do, and hopefully, not be ashamed if we want to see a therapist or feel it'll benefit to… to see if… I mean, if a therapist is ashamed to a therapist, this is not good for us. In the… in the United States, it's funny. We still have some inhibitions. A therapist, he is a therapist, we usually hide it and we, sort of, find somebody who lives 100 miles away. In the UK, it's incredible over in the UK. I think half the therapists make half their money treating the other therapists. Every therapist there sees a therapist, at least one, at least every week. Oh, my gosh, they love therapy over in the UK. They brag about who their therapist is. It's really cute. Okay. Intersubjective therapeutic sense, you really got to have that if you're gonna use this model. And then I have to have a balance. If I… at the end of a session, if I feel I have more empathy for the parent than the kid, all I'm doing to try to fix the kid for the benefit of the parent. And the kid will know that in a second, and he won't be safe with me. If I want to rescue this kid from the parent, the parent will know that in a second. If I'm judging the parent's horrible people and the kid… they got a great, poor, traumatized vulnerable kid. Well, unless I want to take him home with me, I'm not helping anybody. And so if you want to take him home, ask the parent, maybe they will the kid to you. You can't take too many kids home though, probably, or your partner or your dog or whoever will get upset with you. You say… bring too many of these kids into your home and you probably won't be at a function too after bed. Okay. And then this is heart of the… the therapy. So… and I'll just cover those in a little bit. I already talked about co-regulation of affect, which really is comes from attunement, which is one third of intersubjectivity, but that's the resonating emotional energy part of it. Co-creation of meaning and reflective functioning, uh, those first two are really key to attachment. If you get attachment researchers in a room, and they want to, sort of, talk their craft or what they do for a living, which is research attachment, you will get them fighting. And it's really cute. They fight over those tiniest things that people want to say, "Who cares?" But researchers care about stuff like that, and it's what they do for a living. But a lot of them will say, security attach… Why is attachment so important? And why are there thousands of studies now showing it's correlated with mental health? Why are… why is that true? And a lot of them say because securely attached kids can regulate affect so much better, and affect regulation is key for mental health. When you learn to… when you're securely attached, you just do, for all kinds of reasons that we don't have time to discuss. Then you have these other researchers say, "No, no, no, that's not affect regulation is the important thing for attachment security. It's the ability to reflect on your life and other people." Reflective functioning is the key thing in mental health. So they have big fights. Is it reflective functioning or is it affect regulation? Reflective functioning means you're aware of your thoughts, feelings and motives. You know what's going on inside of you. It's not reflect, like reflect on how to build a car or something, it's… it's "What are my… What's my inner life?" As well as what's the inner life of other people? "Why do my parents… What are my parents thinking now?" "What do they feel now?" "What are their intentions behind their behavior?" That's reflective functioning. It's interesting that one researcher said, around six months of age… six months of age, kids are able to know the motives of their parents. Infants at six months get it, why their parents do things. A different… their brain works better when they get it, then it works differently that when they don't know why their parents are doing things, which is remarkable. Well, a lot of the kids we work with don't have much reflective functioning, so we got to facilitate that, just like we have to facilitate the regulation of their affect. And as… reflective function means what's that about? Why did you do that? What are you thinking? What are you feeling? Which is the meaning of the event. So we have to help kids to know the meaning of things… including why they hit their mother or their father. Why they were abused? Well, what is the meaning? Every foster or every kid who has abused and comes into my office, what meaning does he give the abuse? Every one, the meaning they give is the meaning given to them by the perpetrator of abuse. That's what they… That's the line, because that's a nature of intersubjectivity. If your father is pounding you, and says you're a rotten no-good kid, then meaning of that comes from the father. And the child has no way to defend against that. "I was abused because I'm a dirty, rotten kid." So I have to help this kid give new meaning to that event. I can't change the event. I can't rescue him from that event. It happened five years ago or two months ago, or something. I have to help him re-experience that event, so I have to co-create new meaning of that event, of that abuse, which is facilitating his reflective functioning. He has to start wondering about things. Why does that happen? What do you think? What do you feel and you want? When I was trained as a play therapist, I was told the kids can't make sense of things unless it's through metaphor and play, which is nonsense. Kids can do that. Healthy kids do it all the time. My kids were doing it when they were two. They will tell me what they thought, what they wanted. They would talk about their life and the meaning that they gave things. But kids we work with don't have that experience with parents. We help them to develop their reflective functioning. Non-verbal, verbal, that's the… this is a communication theory. Communication therapy, it's not a talking therapy, even though I talk a lot. But I never talk without the underlying nonverbal expression behind the talk. If I lecture a kid… if you see in the tapes, if you see me lecturing a kid, I'll buy you a drink afterwards. We might argue on the definition of lecture. But lecturing doesn't work. So I really work not to lecture kids. When I talk with kids, it's the nonverbal carries the words, the meaning comes from the nonverbal more than from the words, even though the words are important. When I talk with kids, it's more like a storyteller talks with kids. It's a storytelling way of being rather than a lecturing way of being. Okay. So the nonverbal is very crucial. Follow lead, follow simply means, "Is this a directive therapy?" No. "Is that a non-directive therapy?" No. It is more of how parents are with their kids. Parents are non-directive when they are able and directive when they have to be. So as a therapist, I'm non-directive when I'm able. I'm happy to sit forever as a non-directive therapist if the kid is able to utilize that. I was trained with Carl Rogers' primary descendents or disciples, or whatever you call them. I was trained… once every year, you're allowed to ask a question in therapy, that's it. Yeah, one question a year. Now I ask about one every minute. Yeah. Anyway, so because I lead kids into the stuff they avoid, because they have developed a strategy of dissociate from and avoid major stuff. If I sit and wait for them to start to feel safe enough to tell me about the trauma, we'll wait years, lot of the kids. But it's so hard when I was sitting there with kids and I was told I couldn't initiate until they were ready. They would initiate it or they'd give me signs they were ready. And I call that… those errors of omission, almost psychological neglect of kids. It's my responsibility to help them feel safe enough, and then I lead them into the trauma and back off. I follow their response lead, and I lead again and back off, and I lead again and back off in a gentle, empathic way, respecting the fact that this is hard and we're gonna have to do it slow. But they got to go there, and I got to help them to go there, respectfully and following their response all the time. I can't bash them with it, but I can't avoid it. I can't allow them to avoid it. I can't be complicit in the primary defense of avoidance. Interactive repair happens a lot when you do follow-lead-follow, because the kids say, "Shut up, I don't want to talk about that." Well, I have to repair a relationship or, "You're just trying to make me unhappy." I was stunned the first time the kid said that, when I was trying to help them understand a trauma. "Why are you talking about this?" Well, I'm just trying to help you to figure out. "No, you're not. You're trying to make me unhappy!" That was his read about my motive. And so I have to repair that. If that's what he believes, then I have to repair our relationship because he doesn't trust me if my goal was to make him unhappy. Pace. I think we'll talk about that later, so I'll skip it. Active flow and momentum, that means the story telling. I'm responsible to keep a dialogue going. I mean, doesn't mean hyperactive talking. It means I can't drift. I have to keep it… I have to keep a focus going on our conversation. It's gonna be a… There's gonna be a goal here. It might be a distant goal, but it's gonna be some direction and movement in our relationship. And that's my job. I'm not a person who will sit quietly with kids 'cause they interpret silence often as rejection, as impatience, as they are failing, they are not doing their job. Adults are better with silence, kids are horrible with silence. They just don't… They give meaning to silence that you don't want them to give and they give it anyway. So I keep the… I keep the flow of communication going. And then trauma resolution integration, I mean, that's the goal. In the context of that, we're developing attachment and cont… as you're developing attachment, you're resolving trauma. I'm often asked, "Well, shouldn't you… How can a kid form attachment if they haven't resolved their trauma?" "Or how can they resolve the trauma if they haven't developed the attachment?" What comes first, the chicken or the egg? The beauty of attachment as it was made to resolve traumas, to keep people safe. So as you're developing attachment, you're helping a kid resolve trauma. As you resolve your trauma, you're helping to develop the attachment if the attachment figure is present in the room as an active participant in the therapy. So I'm gonna work really hard, quickly, to help the attachment figure be a safe figure, so they could be in the room, develop the attachment. And one of the best ways to develop the attachment is the kid is sitting there crying about a trauma, and the parents' arms around the kid and they are comforting and supporting the kid around the trauma, which then makes the trauma resolution so much faster. Trauma folks have a good point. We can't push the kids too fast. We have to set a pace. And if you are alone with the kid, and you are sitting six feet away, and you are taking a non-intersubjective stance, which is more of a neutral ambiguous stance that most therapist are trained in, it will probably take a year safely to address the trauma. If I'm using an intersubjective stance and a parent that they feel safe with has their arm around them, it may take three sessions to what would take a year if the kid was six feet away in a chair, without a parent having to deal with the trauma alone, because my nonverbal presence isn't there, because I've taken a neutral stance. Okay, so the one helps the other. The trauma resolution and the attachment really help each other. Okay. Okay, I already did that. Okay. Oh, I should have… All right. I was supposed to be doing that as I talk, wasn't I? Look at that. Art, these are amazing. You see I'm not used to PowerPoint. I'm just… This is new, a new invention, PowerPoint.

DANIEL HUGHES Am I doing well? 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN Yes, 100%. 

00:41:30
DANIEL HUGHES Well, thanks for that. Take somebody from New Jersey to tell me something like that. Okay, reflective functioning. Okay, I already said what that's about. Okay. Oh, more on reflective functioning. See, we like it. It promotes the child's experience. The kid exists in my heart and mind, and the parent, vice-versa, enhancing reflective functioning, security of attachment resilience helps the child to rethink his negative attributions and the motive. One study came out in 2002 and it was called Developmental Psych or Child Development or (inaudible ) Journal. There were two features, they compare kids in foster care, who were… all had been sexually abused. These 30 were making a lot of progress after a year in a good foster home. These 30 were not. And then they… they tested them in 50 different ways to find out why did these kids make progress and these kids not. They found only two differences. The one was attributions of the motives of the foster parents. If they thought the foster parents did it for bad motives, they didn't change. If they thought that this… And the foster parents was controlled. I mean, they were all equally good people. But the ones who couldn't get out of their… their reflective functioning were so slanted toward negativity, they couldn't see the motives of the foster parent when they disciplined them in any way other than negative. And the second they were ashamed, they attributed negative motives to themselves. They were rotten kids. That's why they did things. So there's no hope then. If you're living with rotten people and you're rotten person, why would you ever change? Okay. Oh, that's good. Facilitating verbal, nonverbal. You might be sitting there thinking, "Yeah, right, my kids don't talk. I can't have a conversation with them?" Well, they say "I don't know" or "I don't know." I don't know. And they are not lying and they are not avoiding stuff. They don't know their inner life. So when they don't know, I just start making guesses. And I wonder about this and I wonder about that. I might start talking for them? And the kid looks there, and I read his nonverbal expression when I said, "Hey, why don't you sit over there next to your mom?" And he… you know, gives me that one of those facials. Say, "Well, we're not to… What do you want to tell me now?" "I don't know." "Oh, the way you looked at me I thought you wanted to say, 'Oh, I want to do that, dad, it's none of your business. I'll say what I…' Is that what you wanted to say?" I guess what his nonverbal expression means, totally accepting, non- judgmentally and then help the kid to start to know whey they do things. I do it over and over again. I talk for kids a lot. Also, not just for what's happening between us, the kid has hit his mom yesterday. We finally, after 20 minutes, the kid is able to stay in a conversation with me and his mom about it. Then I said… And I finally… and I may say to the kid, "Why don't you tell your mom that sometimes when she says no to you, you think she says it 'cause she doesn't like you and that's why you get so mad at her?" Because that came out of our storytelling, we're creating stories together. The kid doesn't. So I said, "I'll talk for you, is that okay?" Ninety-nine percent of the time, they say fine. Then I turn, I put my chair next to the kid, I put my hand on his shoulder and I say, "Mom, sometimes you say no to me I just think you do it because you don't like me, and that's why I get so mad, because I've had so many moms who just didn't like me and wanted to throw me away. And I think you're gonna do the same, and that's why I get so mad." So I talk like that for the kid. And often the kids will soften and get vulnerable and say, "Yeah". Because if I resonate, my guess is pretty accurate about what the heck is gone on inside when they hit their mother and it's… it has to do with fear of abandonment. Fear of the mother doesn't like him, which often is attachment related theme, so it's probably half a dozen and tend to be the key themes and then we have fine-tune it a bit, but they aren't that many. Then I'm able to help the kid move with the parent into a good dialogue about, why he hit her yesterday. About why she said no to him and, and… and not just the reasons but her empathy for him. "Oh, my gosh, son, I didn't realize that you thought when I say no to you, it's because I don't like you and I want to throw you away." "Oh, my gosh, now I understand why you get so angry with me. Thanks for letting me know." Then I've dialogues like that with the parent, who I've coached and mentored how to do that with their kids. And I also talk about kids a lot. It also works well. But when you talk about kids, you can't talk about them in a negative way. You know, so the kid's sitting there, you turn to the parents say, "Boy, you got stuck with a rotten kid, didn't you?" I mean, that's not healthy for anybody. But when I turn to the parents and say, "My goodness, the courage of your son to sit here and talk about these things, and now he's getting a bit impatient with me. I hope you understand why he is? And when call me F-off old man. I hope you're okay about that, because I'm okay. I think he's saying I'm going too fast." So when I talk about kids like that, they sit there and they listen and they feel safer, and they feel somebody gets it. And I'm making sure the parent gets it, so they are not angry with the kid for telling me to F-off. Talking about kids really helps them to feel safe. They also listen better when you talk about them. If you talk to a kid and you say, "Gee, I think you did that because they forget what you said two minutes later." But when I talk to the parent, "Gee, I think your son did that because they believe you more, it's weird how it works." It sort of like, if you hear a friend gossiping about you, you believe them. That's what the0 really mean. If they tell you to your face, you tend to think they are just saying it because they should. It is polite or something. But when they talk about you, you know they are telling the truth. Why… what would their motive be? Okay. Okay. I talked about reciprocity. This is… Oh, yeah. The kids don't have a clue about how to have a conversation with somebody, don't have a clue. They either ask a million questions, or they don't talk at all, or they change the topic every five seconds. They don't know I to have conversations like human beings need to do to develop. So I have to facilitate their ability to conversations and really that reciprocity that I get, follow-lead-follow. I'm constantly moving into a conversation with the kid, wondering about this, wondering about that, moving in there. I want therapy to be like having lunch with the friend where you just chat about whatever comes up. And then if your friend, you know, had a car accident two days before and they haven't brought it up, I'll say, "Hey, I hear you had a car accident?" I've got to ask my friend about car accident. So I don't bring it up, I'll ask him about it and if this kid got hurt by his father two months ago, I'll say, "Hey, you got hurt by your father two months ago." I need to understand the kid. But being hurt by your father, I have to understand that, but I also have to understand why you wear those shoes, or I have to understand why you like soccer rather than baseball. I need to understand everything about a kid. But I can't sit back when the important things in a kid's life are avoided. And I'm constantly searching for the nonverbal and giving meaning to it, wondering about it, noticing it, the kid knows. He's gonna communicate with me. He can't stop communicating. If he's frozen, I'll notice that. So… Interactive repair, I have to reestablish the relationship. Making it clear the relationship is important. It's my responsibility. I'm not gonna say, "You know, we'll deal with that next week." I'm not gonna say… If a parent says, "You know, we'll talk about it tomorrow", you say, "No, stay up a little late." You got to get some repair before you go to bed. I got to get that intersubjective reestablished and make kids feel safe in a relationship. Okay, this is what I… You see attitude to DDP is all about being playful. Playful is a way to be close without being affectionate. Kids get scared of love and stuff like that. But when you're laughing and smiling and giggling, kids are often okay about that. Acceptance… the inner life of the child is never judged. The kid hates me. I'm really happy he told me. I'm not annoyed that he say hates me. I'm happy he told me. Why would I be annoyed about something in his inner life? I got to convince parents of that. If your kid says he hates his brother, he hates you. Why discipline that? I mean, you're shutting them down and he'll stop telling what his inner life. And a thought or a feeling should never be judged. It just is. So why would I get annoyed about that? Curiosity, I'm deeply fascinated by the inner life of the other person. I want to understand you. I want to get to know you. I'm fascinated by who you are. I'm deeply interested in you. It's not judgmental. What's that about? Wonder what… any idea? It's why, but I usually don't use the word "why" 'cause it's usually loaded with judgment. Once in a while I'll say, "Hey, I wonder why you did that?" As long as I'm very careful that there's no judgment behind it. Any idea what that's about? And if you do that without judgment, kids will really go with you and start to tell you and start to make sense of it. There's this 12-year old girl I was asked to consult on a case. The therapist and the parents thought she was adopted at 10. You don't have a therapy. They thought she was doing pretty well. They are sitting around dinner one night and she said, "Someday, I'm gonna kill", to her parents. Well, that got her back in therapy. Okay, back to therapy. I thought we were done. So she won't talk in therapy. Now my guess as to why she won't talk is she felt judged. She felt people are little tense and weren't happy about that plan to kill them. So, I don't know why, but… So anyway, she shut down and won't talk. So after a few sessions, the therapist said, "Well, I don't know what to say. Lock your bedroom door at night, but and what can I say. I mean, she won't talk about it and she's doing well. You know, her life is going pretty well." Okay. So couple of months later, "I'm still gonna kill you." So, I'm not gonna get upset about that because I don't… why would I get upset about a kid saying, "I'm planning to kill you"? I mean, it makes no sense to get upset until you know why they want to kill you. Again, it's easy for me to have that attitude. The kid doesn't sleep in my house. Okay. But as a therapist, I got to have an attitude like that. I can't… I can't judge that. Okay, curiosity also keeps me from reacting. You know, if a kid says, "You stupid old fool", why would I get annoyed about that? He's sharing his inner life with me. This is exciting. He's telling me he thinks I'm a stupid old fool. That's great. Oh, my goodness, so I'm a stupid old fool. Okay, the old thing. What gave me away? Oh, the wrinkles. I got to get more Botox. Okay. I'll work on that, but fool? Why do you think I'm a fool anyway? What have I said to make you think I'm a fool? Okay, I don't know the rap music that you like, so what? Okay. I have music you don't know either. I'm sorry for getting distracted, I'm old. Okay. So I was asked to consult. So this girl comes in and we were sitting there chatting and I said, "Hey, how many families have you had?" "Three." "How come you're not with your first family?" "They abuse me." "Okay. So what happened then?" "I was put in a foster home." "Why aren't you with them?" "Well, because foster care is temporary and then these people adopted me." "Okay, so now you're in the third family?" "Yeah." "So are you gonna lose this family too and end up having a fourth?" "No." "You're not?" "Well, I'm not gonna have a fourth. No." "Are you gonna lose them though?" "Yeah." "How you're gonna lose them?" It's okay, you're safe. Your parents are okay about you telling me. I'm just curious about how you're gonna lose them." "My dad's gonna die." "Okay. How is he gonna die?" She starts crying. "He goes to McDonald's and eats junk food and my mom said if you keep eating that junk food it's gonna kill you, but he's still eating it." So she's crying. I look at the parents, and dad's little embarrassed, mom's a little embarrassed. So I turn back to her and I said, "But you said you'd lose your parents and you lose your family, but you know, your dad dies, you still you have mom, won't you?" "No." So she's crying some more. "Why won't you have your mom?" "I don't know how it works, but someone said, if you love somebody a lot and they die, you die of a broken heart." "And your mom loves your dad." "Yes, so she's gonna die too with a broken heart." So she's sitting there crying. So I'm saying, "Well, then you would be in a forth home no? Right?" "No." "Why?" "Because I'll kill myself." "Why would you do that?" "So I'll be with them forever in heaven." "Oh. Oh, I get it. So is that why you're gonna kill them?" "Yeah, I'm tired waiting. I can't wait any longer for them to die." I mean it's simple. Well, it's reasonable. I mean, you really think it out. You waited 10 years to get attachment figures, finally if somebody… And you're terrified every moment of your life you're gonna lose them. And you got a trigger, which is dad goes to McDonald's. Mom says she's gonna kill you if you don't stop eating that food. I mean, it's funny in a way, but it's very sad. But curiosity is the only way to ever understand that, which is a deep fascinating fascination over the motives of a person for why they do stuff. But you have to be totally nonjudgmental about it. You can't be an enforcer here. You can't be the police of right and wrong. And thoughts and feelings are never right and wrong, they just are. So I have to be curious about that. Empathy is when I'm with a kid, which means I'm with them emotionally. Which means that they are crying, there's gonna be tears in my eyes. If they are not rolling down my cheeks, they are gonna be there. I'll be right with the kid in his despair here. That doesn't mean I'm in despair myself. It means he gets it that I get it how hard things are. When he's terrified, he gets it that I get it, how hard that is being terrified all your life. When he's in despair, when he's outraged about something, he sees my nonverbal empathic response, and it might sometimes be verbal too. He gets it that I'm with them in this. I'm not a neut0al observer. He talks about trauma, I'm gonna cry. And may be not quite… I shouldn't say this. I won't say it then. I mean, a friend of mine, a woman who uses this model of therapy. Oh, I gave it away, didn't I? Women cry more than men, that's the point. I have to be careful how I say it, but they do. Anyway, this teenager, she's working with using this model, and the teenager really hates therapy. And finally, she says… the therapist says to her, "You know, I really… I don't have a sense of what your life has been like these 15 years." "Well, why don't you read my stupid file?" "I read it, but all they give me is facts. I don't know your experience of them. Help me understand what's it been like." "Well, read my autobiography." "What autobiography? There's nothing in your file." "Should be in there. I had to write one for the last stupid therapist. And you know what she said? That's why my problems. Well, dud." "It's not in there. Do you have it?" "I got a copy at home." So she brought it in. "Can I read it now?" She read it. Took her ten… there's about ten pages, at least ten minutes to read it. During the reading, she didn't say one word. At the end, she has put it down. By now tears are rolling down her cheeks without any word. This kid had been traumatized by so many people, including her adoptive father. How could you not respond that way? So she looks up at this 16-year-old teenage girl, really tough, and she's crying. Why was she crying? Because of the therapist's experience of that, not the interpretation of that, better her experience of that. She was with her with empathy into to a life like that. So to run away from that, those things… especially for these kids, maybe a middleclass neurotic adult, fine be neutral, but you can't for these kids, they are just way too abandoning them. And… and intersubjectivity says it's not important, this trauma, that it's sort of… It doesn't touch me that you've been traumatized. That's not a good nonverbal communication. Okay. I mentioned that. We got to get the flow of the conversation going. That's my responsibility. When you have drift, hyperactive kids drift all the time. You got to really be aware of that with hyperactive kids. You got to take this. Ah, boy, you start with a non-directive. Let's wait and see what happens with the hyperactive kid. You are all over the world, you don't get them back. With hyperactive kids, I bounce right in there, I get a lead and I get momentum going. And pretty soon, they are doing stuff they don't know they are doing. And I go in a waiting room and I'm more hyper than they are. I get real bouncy and enthusiastic and energized, and I just move them right through, and they are following my lead. Because if I follow their lead, we're all over the world, they can't attend, they can't focus very well. But if I catch them, then they are more likely to stay with me on it. Okay. Okay. Yeah… yeah, I think people, the therapeutic window idea, I think people really get that. If two, you know, you got to… You can't push beyond… They are available, they are safe. But you can't… they can't be relaxed and be able to avoid stuff. You have that opening there, and you got to stay right in that narrow gap between non-directive and directive, where they are safe enough, but they are willing and able to explore within that safety, with some anxiety, but still, they are safe. The anxiety isn't too much for them. So intersubjectively, we do gradual exposure. If we always follow their response, and if their response is, "This is too fast", then we slow down. So it is gradual exposure. It's not a impulsive hyper therapy, but it's not a nondirective therapy either. Then I'm co-regulating the affect, as I co-regulate the affect associated with the trauma, they are safe enough to go into the trauma. Then the meaning can be co-created. The co-regulation is more about safety. The reflective function is more about, you know, meanings. And then every cue the kid is telling me I can keep going or I've to stop. Every nonverbal cue of the kid, I have to take a break from and pause, have empathy about how hard it is. Take a deep breath with them, sit there, squeeze his hand, have the parents squeeze his hand, get a drink of water and then get going again. But I have to really be aware of the kid saying, "I need a break. This is hard." Shame, shame is as hard to work with as trauma 'cause, I mean, I shouldn't… shame is as hard to work with terror. Terror, at least we have a biological tendency when you are afraid to go an attachment figure. That's what attachment figure is all about. You're afraid. That's the deal with fear. You're afraid, you go to an attachment figure. With shame, shame activates hiding from attachment figures, which means hiding from therapist, which means look away, no eye contact for shame. Shame is not a good emotion. It really causes a mess in human beings. It's not guilt. And I really differentiate shame from guilt. Guilt is necessary for conscience development, and repair relationships, and remorse and accepting responsibility, and fixing and changing. Shame makes you… moves into… you're at risk for… it's an isle and blaming and excuses and, and rage over somebody addressing your problems. Shame is… messes things up for therapy and for parenting and stuff, and for learning from experience. The kids we work with tend to do the same thing wrong 20 times in a row. Why? Because they always have an excuse for it. They never face the fact they did something wrong. So why would I learn from it? There's nothing to learn. I have it… I already know why and I have scored an excuse. Alright, blame someone else for it. So shame causes you to run away from stuff. You don't learn. Okay. So how do I reduce shame? A lot of matching the affect of it, the person's in shame and usually they shut down, so my voice gets quiet. "Oh, my gosh, it's so hard to talk about it, isn't it?" I probably won't look at him for a while, 'cause looking can be too invasive, that's why the kids hide. You can't do this therapy without a pillow in your office. The kids need a pillow to hide behind. Kids can have a great conversations hiding behind a pillow. But they can't look at you then. It's too shame. They feel too much shame to be able to look at you. Then I accept that experience that they are having. I have empathy for it. I'm curious about it, and then further empathy and curiosity. Shame is… I'm not got gonna talk them out of it. When a kid says, "I'm a bad kid", I got to grab the parent before they open their mouth, because they tend to say, "No, you're not." Even some therapists say that honest. I know it's hard to believe, but some therapists will say, "You're not a bad kid", which makes the shame worse, and makes them feel less safe with you because then they… they're convinced you are clueless. You don't have a…You don't have any understanding of who they are. They are so rock solid convinced that they are bad kids. You can't argue with them. You have to have empathy about and curious… "Oh, my gosh. So when you make mistake, you think it's 'cause you're bad. How hard that must be for you. Oh, have you had that thought long, when you make mistakes? What do you recall first thinking when you do something wrong, it's because you're a bad person? You think it's anything to do with the fact your father used to scream at you and call you no-good? You think that's why you start to think you're bad?" "I don't know." "It must be very to… How do you handle that feeling?" You know, things like that. I'm curious about, I've empathy about, but I don't want to argue with people when they say they are bad. Working with resistance, okay. Forget the power struggles, they don't work. The kids are masters at power struggles. We call it oppositional defiance. They are great at it, and you're lose that battle unless you're oppositional defiant yourself. But then, you probably won't be a good therapist. Avoid lectures, all you get is dissociation. And they parrot back what they are supposed to say it to get you off their back. Depending on where you are in the therapy, always pace. You probably stop with pace and the early stages of therapy. And as you move it along, you start to address things more in terms of underneath the… Once you have the safety, then you want to move into integration. Then you probably are starting to move into addressing some of the issues under the shame, either in the past, in the present shame, and less likely to, sort of, set it aside for now as therapy moves along. Probably hold them there, with empathy about it, and bringing out there. And they're angry with me over that I brought it up now the third time in the session, I brought it up. And the first, early in the therapy I probably won't keep bringing it up. But I will, after I bit, with empathy, about why I'm not agreeing with him to set it aside, or why I feel it's really crucial to do this. Okay. Oh, there we are. Did I go too far? No, I didn't. Okay, that's where I'm supposed to stop. And I see we have five minutes. Anybody have a question about any of that stuff? Yes. 

01:05:05
UNKNOWN I had a question when you were talking about child (inaudible ). 

01:05:11
DANIEL HUGHES Yeah. 

01:05:15
UNKNOWN And so, uh, our daughter attends therapy at Wesley and she often says that she goes there because she's fat. And so we… I don't know, maybe mistakenly say that the behavior is unsafe. She rages and she has very violent and aggressive episodes. And so we say that she doesn't go because she's bad. She demonstrates unsafe behavior, then that's when she goes to Wesley. 

01:05:35
DANIEL HUGHES And (inaudible ) to help with her with unsafe behavior? 

01:05:45
UNKNOWN Umm… Her, her… She doesn't demonstrate the behavior anywhere except with us. 

01:05:50
DANIEL HUGHES Okay. Well, it's a little different then. 

01:05:50
UNKNOWN Asked for some more therapy. 

01:05:55
DANIEL HUGHES Okay. So you're saying the unsafe behaviors occur at home? 

01:05:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:05:55
DANIEL HUGHES And I probably go further than that. The unsafe behaviors has to do with how hard it is for you to learn how to have parents, and the respite home, you give her break. And you're doing really hard work, Sweetie, and I really admire her. But you need a break from this and a respite, you're able to just hang out, relax and because the anger doesn't get big over there, right, because we're not around. And you know what? And it's hard for all of us. So we're getting a break too and we're relaxing, because it takes a lot of energy to care for you the way you need us to care for you. And we want to do it. We love you so much. We're gonna keep doing it. We need a break once in a while and you need a break also, respites about break, that's what it's about. But no, I'm bad then, so but that's conversation happened a half hour after, from my point of view, it happened a half hour after she said, "I'm bad". My first statement would be empathy. "Oh, my gosh, sweetie", and if she'll let you, I put my arm around her and say, "So we say you're going to rest, but you think it's because you're bad. Oh, how hard that must be for you. I'm so sorry that that's your experience of why we're sending you to respite. That must be so scary if you think we're doing it because you're bad. Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry that's your experience now. Have you always thought that? Like, how about when we argue at home? How about when I've to scold you or I won't let you do… Do you think you were doing that or disciplining you at home because we think you're bad, too? You think that? Oh, has that always that way? Are we ever able to say no to you when you don't think you're bad? How do you handle that feeling, girl? Thanks for letting us know. I didn't realize…" So I really stay with that, and then the information… She does need that to start to challenge her brain, but she won't be open to challenging her brain about the reason you're sending her to respite until she guess that you get it, the depth of this experience of being bad. You had a question too? 

01:07:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. When you do… Do you have a room inside there where you have stuff…? 

01:07:50
DANIEL HUGHES My room looks like a living room. It's not barren, lot of toys all over the place. I might bring in some puppets, I might bring in some stuffed animals. I might bring in paper and pens to draw with, or markers to draw with. If I'm an art therapist, I would have art things. If I'm a drama therapist, I might have drama stuff. So it's not incompatible, the tradition play therapy. It's a different stance and at least I was trained as a play therapy. But it's not incompatible to use metaphor. I'm not against metaphor. I'm just saying if we don't use conversation too, we're really doing therapy one-hand tied behind our back. And I'm not gonna have stuff in the room that tempts kids, you know, distracts kids. So but it's… but it's gonna be a warm room, and a safe room, and I got to have a couch. I got to have a place where the parent can hold their kid, put their arm around the kid and have the kid be embraced by the parent, snuggle with their parent or have the kid between two parents. I couldn't do therapy without a couch. Rocking chair will be nice too. Little music in the background, some books here and there, stuff like that. But it's really like a living room. Yes? 

01:09:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). What if they that you (inaudible). I mean, isn't that kind of on, you know, hurting other people? How can you (inaudible )? 

01:09:20
DANIEL HUGHES Uh… They are saying it to a sibling, "I hate you." And you are saying… Well, it's two things here. You're concerned about the wellbeing of your other child. 

01:09:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:09:31
DANIEL HUGHES Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. I might ask the kid to say, "It sounds like you're very angry at your brother? Would you tell him that? Because the hate word can cause a lot of pain to a lot of people. So if you're very angry just say, "I'm really mad at you" or "I don't like what you're doing", or you can even say 'I don't like you right now', stuff like that. Let your brother know you're angry with him, that's fine. But if we use hate, yeah, we're not gonna be happy about the hate word. If in fact, that's your values and your judgment about that. And I might say, he can't call me certain names and use certain words with me too." That crosses the line from expressing your inner life to behavior. So if you start swearing at me and call me horrible names, that's behavior? And that's not expression of your inner life, that's behavior and I'll discipline it like a… I'll discipline him kicking me. If he verbally assaults me, I'll discipline that. If he physically assaults me, I'll discipline that. But I have to decide where the line is about acceptable words and not acceptable. And I have to give a lot of freedom to express his anger at me or toward his siblings about, "I don't like that. I really don't think you're being fair. You're just so mean to me." Those things to me would be expression of your own life rather, and I won't discipline that as behavior, or a lack of respect or anything like that. I would accept that. I'm keeping the channels open. I want to know what he's thinking and feeling. And if you… You can't say, "I'm really mad at you, mommy." That's a lie. The truth is, "I'm really mad at you, mommy!" That's true, not really, that's not true. So he has to… nonverbal has to be a part of it, or he's not telling the truth. You know, you tell the truth about what he feels about me. He will then move or seem to be able to repair our relationship or communicate what's going on inside. If he does it to a sibling, again, I have to make a decision here. When is this a behavior that's being mean to a sibling? Or he's telling his sibling he doesn't like him. Well, that's fair. "I don't like you now. I'm mad at you", stuff like that. Then I work with the… It's hard when your brother doesn't like you, huh? Yeah, you care so much about him, da-da, da-da-da. "Yeah, I can understand. Oh, I wonder if when he says he doesn't like you, if part of you doesn't like him." I want to teach your sibling how to get a little more assertive and how to be okay when somebody doesn't like him. Uh… 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:11:55
DANIEL HUGHES He's not ready to go into that. His shame… He needs to be ready, but the hitting when you bring up his problems, generally it's a shame… shame, generally it's rage, generally, big predictor, rage or shame. So generally when the kid starts hitting right before it was terror, something they are afraid of or shame, or a combination of the two. So… and your discipline may cause her and shame. He's afraid you're gonna throw him away or beat him, and he's ashamed that you think he's bad. So often, the kids move into those states for that reason. Oh, I see it's… I think it's time for a break. So see you after the break.
