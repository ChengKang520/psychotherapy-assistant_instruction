Economic Privilege and Protection from Consequences: How Affluence and Inequality Structure Differences in Identity, Resilience, and Self-Efficacy William M. Liu, Ph.D. University of Iowa 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Good afternoon, everyone. Um, it is my privilege and honor to introduce our next speaker, Dr. William Liu, who is a professor and program coordinator of counseling psychology at the University of Iowa, my Alma Mater. I can tell you that Dr. Liu is cited as one of the most frequent producers of research in the psychology of men and masculinity, and most cited in multi-competency research. I can tell you that Dr. Liu is the editor of the handbook of multi-cultural competencies in counseling psychology and the editor of the fourth-coming handbook of social class and counseling. But what I most want to tell you is my experience with Dr. Liu, or Will, as I call him. In 2007, I had the privilege of having Will not only as my graduate adviser, my professor, but also as my clinical supervisor when I did my practicum in the Iowa Homeless Shelter. Will helped me unpack my experiences of marginalization as a woman of color in a predominantly white environment, but also realize my experiences of privilege as a woman from an affluent background and having economic access. Will, to me, is the epitome of a counseling psychologist who not only values social justice as it pertains to the mission of our field, but also practices empowerment and respect and it pertains to the future counseling psychologist. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Liu.

DR. WILLIAM M. LIU Uh, that really makes me feel old in some ways, but I appreciate it. Thank you very much for having me and I want to thank the, uh, coordinators of the Round Table for inviting me back to make a presentation. And similar, for those of you who were here for Lisa's presentation, it does feel like a homecoming; it is one of the first conferences that I felt at home at, and one of the nice things about coming to present at the Round Table is that at, at, for me, at this point, I get to present ideas, things that are in motion for me, uh, rather than, sort of, things that I've fixated on. But it's, uh, uh, it's nice to be able to be in an environment where I can, sort of, present a general concept and, hopefully, we'll have enough time that, uh, we'll have some conversation about the, uh, general presentation for today. Privilege. One of the ideas of privilege is that, uh, one of the difficult things about shaking people from privilege is that it feels so good when you have it, quite simply. It is, in is, in essence, um, a positive for those people who are able to express it, and for those individuals who have access to privilege. But the problem is, is it good and is it healthy? And what are the problems with having privilege and are there consequences to having privilege? And what are those relate, in relation to metal health? One of the, uh, issues that I came across in studying privilege, and I had the privilege of being on a privilege task-force when Tania Israel was, uh, president of Division 17. And you have to imaging, uh, there are a group of us, probably, uh, 12 or 13 of us, on a conference call every two weeks, for about two hours, talking about privilege, and we never got any specific answer; we just talked about privilege. And it was one of those really nebulous concepts that, I think, intuitively, you'd think you would understand because, I think, we work from Peggy McIntosh's work on white privilege, and we extended it to our discussion about privilege in other domains. But one of the problems that we, I cam across was that it, uh, might be too general to just think about it as generally an unearned, um, benefit. So, generally, what we understand from privilege is that privilege can be defined in broad terms as a special right or benefit, advantage given to a person simply due to his race or his or her race, religion, uh, or social class. Privileges are generally invisible and are usually exercised unknowingly and assumed be, to be natural. One of the, uh, ideas around privilege, here, is that privilege is an affordance given to us based on identity, an identity that we have no control over. Does that make sense? So, it's racial privilege, it's gender privilege, it is social class privilege; we have no control over those things. Those affordances are provided for us by the social structures, uh, in our society. The only control we have over the privilege is the expression of it. We have no control over the affordances given by, given, uh, to us by privilege. The other, uh, issue related to, for me, in, in understanding, um, economic privilege, is that, uh, using a general concept of privilege, as I just, uh, defined, uh, was unsatisfactory because, unsatisfactory to me because it wasn't tied to any system of power, uh, and it wasn't really, sort of, uh, illuminating how economic privilege or social class privilege operates. Uh, what I do know is that economic privilege cannot be understood by discreet indicators of income, education, or occupation. I think that this one point is sort of my, um, uh, the issue that I keep hammering home in terms of our understanding of social class and so, in psychology, and in, especially in applied psychology, is that understanding, simply, a person's income, education, occupation level, the three indices that are generally used in the research, tells us nothing about the subjective or phenomenological experience of social class in a person's life. The problem also is that all the interesting things that we want to know about, in terms of social class and a person's life, are not accessible by any one of these indicators. Completely not accessible because in, in a large part, they're almost uncorrelated to the psychological manifestation of social class, and so, we have to move towards, to a much more subjective phenomenological experience of how people understand social class. The other issue that, uh, comes across in our understanding of social class, is that there are qualitative changes that occur as you move up the income spectrum. In other words, the, um, the income, income is a word that is, is significant for those of us who still earn an income. In other words, for those of you, mostly students and faculty, who still feel a dollar loss, every time you feel a dollar, every time you spend a dollar and you feel that loss, that's called 'felt dollar loss.' That means, that means, for the most part, income is still a very significant, um, uh, word for you; you respond to that particular word. Now, one of the things that we do know, also, is that as you move up the income spectrum, all of these indicators, all of these, sort of, these, uh, variables that we use to define social class, change; the metrics change. In other words, income is not necessarily relevant to somebody who, uh, earns a dollar wage. In other words, if you go earning an hourly wage, income is actually not the best indicator of how much you make because asking a person, 'how much do you make in a year on income?' is only relevant for those of us who earn a salary because we know, pretty directly, we earn this much money. For those of us who grew up in families where your parents or caretakers, uh, earned an hourly income, uh, hourly wage; it fluctuated. For those of you who worked on, uh, might be a waitress or a waiter, uh, you worked on tips, and those, and your income fluctuates. Not only that, income is one of those variables that people lie about; not only do people lie about, but they just don't know about. So, if you ever get a survey that asks about your in, your parents' income, it's completely erroneous; it has no correlation to, actually, reality because most of you, as undergrads, when you fill out one of these surveys on a psych 100 test, or psych 100 assessment, have no idea, no conceptualization about how income, how income operates. And so, one of the things that I, sort of, propose to you is think about these qualitative changes in, in these indicators as sort of like a rocket launching from the ground into, um, into orbit. What I mean by that is at the very ground level, and we're talking about, sort of, social mobility at this point, so I just sort of want to use this, uh, metaphor. If you think about a rocket, sort of, launching into outer space, and I did a little bit of research on this and I asked some folks in our physics department about this, as well, and they gave me some good in, good information about the, uh, launch of the space shuttle. The launch of the space shuttle, uh, uh, if you think about this in terms of social mobility, most of the fuel that you see that was attached to the space shuttle is spent in the first minute of flight. All of that is to overcome drag and gravity and the centripetal force of pulling the rocket back down to Earth. All of that fuel is spent in the first minute of flight; the rest of the flight is actually based on momentum. It is completely, it, once it reaches a certain trajectory, once it reaches a certain velocity, it is all but, but, uh, flying on momentum. They actually have to slow it down, otherwise the rocket will fly apart because it's going so fast at that point. And so, if you think about it, think about that as sort of a metaphor for social mobility, it, it's accurate in the sense that for those of us who grew up in poor families, or those of us who know poor families, it takes a lot more effort to get going. It's not equal across the spectrum. Not only that, if you think about it as, in terms of speed, as an indicator of a metric, let's say speed is the same thing as we think about it in terms of income; miles per hour is only relevant in the first few hundred feet of flight. After that, miles per hour doesn't actually make sense. What they start to talk about is mach. Right? Mach is the speed of sound, is actually traveling at two times the speed of sound. It, it, it doesn't make sense to talk about it as 30,000 miles per hour because you can't conceptualize that, but if you think about it as mach two, then you sort of think, 'okay, two times the flight, uh, speed of sound.' And so one of the things that happens when, with these qualitative changes as we go up from the lower income levels to the higher income levels, that there are qualitative changes that occur from lower income to higher income. Dollars are meaningful at the lower income, but are relatively meaningless at the higher income levels. Does that make sense? So, that, that's one of the things that we want to make, uh, that's, uh, I want to make a point about because that's relevant in so far as we start to understand economic privilege. Economic privilege, like most privileges, are invisible, is invisible. Um, the power of money is, is related to the access to a person, uh, the person has to, uh, privilege in those upper, in those upper, um, in the upper levels. As I said before, privilege isn't a relation to expression. In, in our understanding of economic privilege, we have to understand it as being tied to the socio-political, socio-historical, and socio-structural systems that make privilege possible. One of the ideas that I sort of came to about, thinking about privilege, is that what is it that allows people to feel as though they can just do what it is that they want to do, or say what they want to do? Uh, and what is it about privilege that all, what is it about that affordance? And if we think about it in a positive way, it becomes sort of nebulous and really difficult to understand, but I think, but I, sort of, was thinking about this one day, and, uh, it arose, uh, surprisingly as a result of, uh, an interaction with my wife; when I was, uh, dropping her off, uh, in, for her class, and I dropped her off in front of her, uh, building, and it just so happens to be a major roadway, and, uh, and I, as I drove up, I realized that there were all these buses, these school buses behind me, and I thought, 'well, I'm going to drop off my wife here. She, I hope she gets out of the car soon because I'm going to, it's going to jam up all this traffic, and start honking.' And as, as I pulled up to her building, and all these buses were behind me, I acted, I was very, uh, calm and I sort of let my wife get out of the car and take her time, and, uh, as I drove away and I said goodbye, and I, I drove away, I thought, uh, 'I didn't, I didn't hurry her up. I, what was it that I was doing at that point?' And I was in, in essence, sort of, protecting her, or protecting us from the consequences of behavior. And so, in essence, this was sort of the germinating action, or event, that I had that, sort of get, sort of, me thinking about this idea that privilege, economic privilege, in particular, is a result of the protection from, uh, is the feeling or the idea that people are protected from the consequences of their behavior. And there are three different levels, or three different areas that I identified preliminarily as, um, how economic privilege protects. One, of course, is the contextual, or the situational, and it protects the individual from the negative effects of the environment. So, a person who grows up in a very protected environment comes away with better health. The protection that they get from it is the belief that the environment is irrelevant to their health because they've never had to confront the consequences of living in a poor environment; either a toxic environment or a violent-prone environment, that's one of the privileges that they get. They get to walk away thinking, 'it's not that big of a deal,' all, uh, you know, and it's not that important to them because they've never had to confront it. Second, behavioral-related problematic actions; they're protected from their, their legal responsibility, in a sense. They can act in ways that they're protected. So, because they've never had to deal, uh, experience the consequences of their actions, they come away thinking, 'the police are just, law enforcement is just, why wouldn't the legal system work for the benefit of other people?' So, it's one of those invisible privileges that they get. And they also are protected in terms of their identity; their racial identity is also protected as a result of economic privilege. And what they get to do is they get to walk away from that sense, uh, from that environment or that protection with the idea that racism is, essentially, not a problem; they've never had to confront it. Even if they even acted in what we'd really identify as a, uh, a racist way, or said anything racial, they've been protected from the full brunt of those consequences, and so they can walk away from that experience thinking that racism is not a problem. What that allows is, uh, especially with economic privilege, is the person to be able to feel like they live in a stable, predictable, and regularized environment. All right? So, the structure allows them to benefit from what they believe to be a very regular, stable, and predictable environment. What that also allows is that any psychological consequences, or any kind of psychological experiences that they have, there's no demand on them. And, so they have much more, uh, freedom. I think Lisa talked about this earlier; they have freer cognitive load to do other things. Those, that freer cognitive load allows them to, um, put that energy into other areas of their life, and that might be, uh, building relationships, it might be studying. All these other areas where they're able to distribute that energy into other sectors; there's less of a cognitive load, there's more energy that they're, that, that's available to them to use in other sectors of their life. For them, one of the, one of the major, um, uh, uh, world views that they tend to have is that they rationalize the status quo; they've never had an experience where the status quo has let them down, and so, for them, the status quo benefits them, and so that's one of the privileges that they have. And, the last point, there, is that the multiple privileges means multiple protections, so the more that you have, the more privileges that you have, the more protections that you're afforded and the more energy and more you're able to distribute your resources in different areas. The re, the resource area's important here because what I talk about are different types of resources that we all have. Some of these are extra personal resources; extra personal resources are simply things like money, um, and time. And, uh, those resources, for instance, when we have money in our pocket, for those of us who, uh, live, um, uh, in a very instrumental world, the money is automatically allotted to certain aspects of our life. We don't have a lot of distributive power in terms of where that money can go; it's got to go to bills, it's got to go here, it's got to go to other areas. It's a very instrumental approach to the ways that we use resources. Similarly, there are inter-personal resources; we also have access to friendships and social support and we also use those resources in very instrumental ways, potentially, as well. There are intra-personal resources, resiliency, positive attitude, things of those sort, that are also considered intra-personal resources. And we configure all of our resources, inter-personal, in, intra-personal, extra-personal, in ways that function for us to keep our world, uh, relatively stable, predictable, livable. Uh, and, and so, one of the, uh, one of the, sort of, ways of consider this is that for, for many individuals, and this is, sort of, a demographic, uh, demographic, uh, issue; for many individuals who live on income or live, uh, um, on a salaried-basis, where most of their monies are already distributed instrumentally, we have to, we have to use our resources in a very direct way. But for those individuals who are much more affluent or more, much more economically, uh, privileged, um, there's less of a need to use those resources in very instrumental ways. And so, what that means is that, in effect, you can sort of think about those, there's a line in instrument use; as the, as the function increases, it overcomes the barriers of, of instrumental use. And what happens is once you top over that, sort of, those barriers, those little blue, uh, uh, spikes, you're able to distribute your resources much more equally across different domains. Each of these different domains, down here, these types of resources, are also demands on our system, and so we have to use those demands very instrumentally. And so what, in essence, what happens, here, and this is where we pull it all together, is that for people who are poor, working class, middle class, most of our resources are already dictated for us in terms of how it, they have to be used, and there's not a lot of distribution power that we have across the different, uh, domain areas. All of these domain areas at the bottom are demands on our system, and they demand resources, but we don't always have the resources to allocate to these different areas. So, for folks who are poor, working class, middle class, we really use most of our resources very instrumentally to just meet basic demands. The benefit of economic privilege, for those individuals who are in the upper classes and in more affluent and wealthy classes, is that they have the benefit of distributing the resources across multiple, multiple sectors. These multiple sectors are, uh, ways of reinforcing their privilege, and so, what I, sort of, call it is, you, you know, if you look at the scaffold, I, I sort of consider people who grow, grew up or, uh, lived in very affluent, wealthy environments, they live in a very scaffolded existence. They live in a very scaffolded life in the sense that they are able to feel, they feel free and they're able to distribute the resources across different domains. In other words, uh, they can use, let's say they have, uh, money, they have income, and they're able to use that money not just to meet their basic, material needs, but they're also able to use it to meet relational needs, they're also able to use it to meet time needs, they're able to spend time on vacations. And so they will distribute basic resources across multiple domains, and that allows them to build their, reinforce their privileged life. And, whereas, folks at the lower levels have to use it very instrumentally, and part of the problem is that, and I, I, I put that ladder next to the scaffold, is that, I think, colloquially, we know this as sort of a ladder of success and, and, um, for those who are poor and working class, um, our access to social mobility can only traverse two or three resource areas. Most, most of the time, it's the use of money as a way for social mobility. The problem is that if we met with any kind of economic trauma, if one of those legs is kicked out, the ladder falls. If, those of you who, uh, who, um, are, paid for school on your own or went on loans, if, uh, or your parents tried to pay for your way through school; if they lost a job, you're out of school. Right? There, it's a very instrumental, one to one, uh, need, uh, need and, uh, demand, and there's not much flexibility in that system, whereas for people who are in the upper, um, economic strata, the more affluent and wealthy, they're able to distribute those resources across multiple domains and then, their ability to do that allows them to withstand economic trauma much more resiliently. Does that make sense? So, for people who are wealthy or affluent, if you lose income, that's not the, that's not the demise of your economic position, it, it isn't. You have many other areas, many other resources there, resources that you can draw upon that can maintain your social status and maintain your social position and maintain your economic privilege. And that's the benefit of living a scaffolded life. So, the economic position, for those who are in the upper classes, the privilege is an extension of the structure, the structure that affords them, uh, um, the feeling of entitlement, that they, uh, can expect a reward without effort. Um, at the higher levels, what we, what we start to know is that the economic, the, um, the power systems are much more organized, are much more direct, much more dependable, and all of those things are relevant because they help us maintain, um, the status quo. All of these, those different institutions are what I consider the, uh, power governors; power governors are systems and mechanisms by which the powerful, by which powerful people manifest their power. And these are, uh, institutions that, uh, privilege those who are in the economic, uh, uh, um, affluent and wealthy. One of the, one of the ideas, here, as we look at the idea of, um, the lattice structure is that for people who are poor and, uh, working class who are moving upwards in terms of social mobility, think about that ladder and its two prongs. Upward mobility for them means only, uh, to me, it means, really, the attachment, or only access to one or two of these nodes of power, but not really access to all of these different, sort of, access points that restructure power and reinforce, um, privilege. And, um, I, sort of configurally, for me, I, I, I think, in very, sort of, uh, these, um, uh, I have to have these graphs and, and so I'm always (inaudible ) drawings, and so this is the, the, the best one that I could come up was that if you think about the space that's afforded these little nodes at the, uh, at the corners on the middle, are the power governors; the power governors are the banking institutions, law enforcement, uh, schooling, education. Um, and they structure a space of privilege that allows the individual in the, um, uh, upper economic, um, strata to feel as though, uh, they're protected from consequences; it's a protected space. It's not only protected space, it's a rationalized space, and rationalized meaning that the space itself, the institutions themselves rationalize privilege and the status quo. Rationalize away and explain away poor behaviors, and the individual who is in these, in this, um, in this, uh, uh, uh, this, uh, stratified, uh, existence, doesn't have to meet with any consequences. And so that's the benefit of sort of understanding that this person is, exists in a, uh, protected space. So, it's a diffusion of responsibility, it, the system is designed to protect those, uh, born into it, and the operations are largely designed to rationalize inequality. So, uh, some of the rationalizations that are very prominent and dominate in the social system, uh, this idea, sort of, a rationalizing status quo, you, uh, you, you know these things such as, um, unsuccessful people are lazy, uh, non-white people are intellectually inferior, the rich earned their wealth, and the naturalistic fallacy that, even in nature, only the strongest survive. What this allows, uh, in a social system that's very regular, very predictable, and very stable, is that, um, it allows an individual in that system, uh, to, uh, not only benefit in economic ways, but they also benefit in all the ways that we understand lead to economic success. So, in other words, a predictable, stable environment is incredibly important in our understanding of how, he, a, a student, for instance, succeeds in school. And I put down, here, this, uh, marshmallow experiment; I think everybody, uh, or most of us have heard about the marshmallow experiment, right, where, uh, um, they put this, um, plate of marshmallows in front of kids and, and they put this marshmallow in front of kids and, uh, and, um, what they did was they said, you know, 'if you can resist eating these marshmallows,' and there's a plate of, like, three or four marshmallows, 'if you can resist eating this plate of three or four marshmallows, when I come back, I'm going to leave the room and then come back. When I come back, I'm going to give you more marshmallows.' Right? And so, what they found was, or what they believed and, and, and what they found, uh, subsequent to that was the kids were able to resist eating those marshmallows, delay gratification, were, uh, also, in the long run, more academically successful. And, so they tracked them over time and found that this behavior was much, was very congruent with academic and economic success. Just recently, they re-did this marshmallow experiment; I don't know how many of you have seen this, but they re-did the marshmallow experiment with one little twist. And this goes, and, when I read it, I was really excited because the, it fits so well into what I was thinking that I had to include it; so the idea behind it was they did, uh, they did the marshmallow experiment, which was stage two, but stage one, what they did was they told these kids, and they gave these kids, um, markers or crayons or colored pencils and in condition one, what they said was, um, 'here are some markers and crayons and such. Um, if you don't use these right now, when I come back, I'm going to give you more markers and crayons.' And so, in condition one, these kids got more markers and crayons, and, uh, in condition two, the experimenter came back and said, 'oh, I'm sorry, we don't have any.' You know? 'But go ahead and play with those that you have, already.' And then, stage two of the experiment was presenting them with the marshmallows. What did we find? Uh, uh, extreme mean effect, in terms of those kids who are in the predictable environment, and stable environment, versus kids who are exposed to the unpredictable environment. Different, completely different; once you prime, once you have that experience of unpredictability, you start to understand the, the idea of delayed gratification, impulse control, all those things that are relevant to academic success, as well as economic success, uh, uh, become much more salient. And so I, I put up here this, uh, this second point is that I have no doubt in, in the clients that I've met and the clients that I've worked with that people in working, lower, poverty classes love their children. They do in the very same qualitative ways that we can assess in any other economic sphere. The biggest problem that they have is creating a stable, predictable environment; that is the, that is the principle issue. And that particular issue is then related to how kids start to see their environment as, as something that they can rely upon, or an environment that they can't rely upon. And that is related to, later on, um, academic and, um, uh, economic success. And so, this other graph, up here, is sort of what I've, sort of, imagined to be the difference between an upper class, very structured, stable environment, and what people in lower class environments experience in terms of the social structure. And it is, in a sense, what I call, sort of, the physics of punishment and, uh, privilege; the physics of punishment and privilege. And what I mean by that is, and it goes back to, um, my, uh, rocket ship, space shuttle, uh, metaphor earlier, which is: in the lower classes, punishment is very direct. You can expect punishment as a direct consequence of a particular action. The privileges and the benefits of the social structure are much more unpredictable. The, and it's the direct opposite of people who are in economically privileged environments, where the punishment is much more unpredictable and much more diffused, but the benefits are much more direct and much more predictable. And so, in those environments, you start to, start, you start to, I believe, start to see, sort of, differences in how people conceptualize themselves as, in terms of resiliency, self-esteem, uh, how they, uh, respond to the environment, and people in different classes. So, I have a couple more slides. And resilience, for me, then, in the upper classes, is tied to how well a person can access structural power centers. And I, and what I, when I started thinking about that, one of the, um, ideas, uh, one of the, uh, sort of, world views that I started to think about was to start to listen to how people in affluent classes responded to, um, essentially problems in their life, uh, things, problems that they've ran into. And so, I listened to folks who are, uh, you know, the Donald Trumps and other folks that when they got into troubles, what did they rely upon in terms of maintaining their status, their status-quo and their privilege. And most often, uh, although they talk about personal agency, what they're really talking about is their access to structural power governors that allow them to diffuse the responsibility and be, maintain their status quo and maintain their social class status, and they're much more aligned and much more wedded to the direct functional operations of the status quo. They have to; that's where they get their world view from, that's where they get their privileges from, it's where they derive all of the benefits. If there wasn't a predictable, stable, power, uh, uh, relationship between the power governors, they wouldn't be where they were. They just, they can't be because they can't operate in that system. They need a system that diffuses their, the consequences of their behaviors. And so, in this particular model, one of the, uh, what we sort of come away with is that for people who are in the affluent and, um, wealthy classes, one of economic entitlement, not just general entitlement, but economic entitlement just, it, it comes across as the expectation that they can really spend their resources across different domains; that that's part of what they understand as part of their privilege and that the expectation is that they can do this without any kind of barrier. That's the environment that they grew up in and that's what they expect, um, will be facilitated for them. Psych, the psychological meaning; well-being is maintain, uh, is very much tied to aspects of the maintenance of the system so that it's, uh, uh, system justification, the idea that the system is always beneficial, so you start to hear that from people in affluent and wealthy classes. And then, in counseling, I believe, what you start to see is that there is anxiety tied to failure and it's not, and they sort of see it as personal failure, but what they're really saying is 'I'm failing with system,' and so, that's part of the anxiety that's, um, that results. And the maladaption is when they believe they're not going to be successful or be able to carry on and maintain the privilege that they, that they've had. In general, there's the social ignorance and naivete about how the, how, uh, systems of power operate. And they're, really, generally unsure, um, uh, who to be when, uh, they're in different context and largely, they don't care because they don't have to care. Right? So, they can move in and out of poor environments and not really care because they're not expected to have any responsibility in those situations. And so, those are, sort of, the psychological outcomes and world views that I believe, uh, are results of, sort of, the structuring of privilege for people in affluent and wealthy classes. So, at, in that, I think we can, I'll stop there and just open it up for questions and comments and... It's one of the, uh, it's one of the issues that I struggled with, which was connecting privilege and resilience, and I wanted to, at some point, try to make privilege relevant to people in the poorer classes. And I, and I, and, and what it came down to is if I followed my, sort of, theoretical model and the assumptions, privilege, economic privilege cannot exist in lower classes. So that's, so we take that part out. But resilience, in lower classes, does exist, and I think the research bears that out fairly well in the sense that, uh, resilience among people who are, uh, who, who score themselves, as well as are scored as, people in, working in poor classes are generally tied to stronger relationships. And part of that is, um, uh, as what you might imagine is that, uh, there's much more inter-dependency necessary for people in lower, lower classes to survive. Um, for instance, there was, uh, one study where, um, they, uh, they gave, it was a, it was a study on pens and how people choose pens. I mean, it seemed like such an innocuous stimuli, that's what I love about social psychology is that they can give you such an innocuous stimuli and you don't really realize what they're doing. But, they had two groups, which was a middle class and a lower class group, and they gave them different pens that they could choose from. And so, the lower class individuals tended to choose pens that were very similar to other people, to the choices that other people made. All right? So, they chose things that were very similar to other people and, and that, economically, that makes sense because they don't have the monitary wear-with-all to withstand a poor choice. They don't, they can't just say, 'aw, it's broken. I'm just going to go out and buy another one.' They have, in a sense, have to say, 'okay, what is everybody else in my group buying and it's working for them, it seems reliable, so I'm going to put my money there and make that decision because it's working.' Because I don't have the economic wear-with-all to keep, if something breaks, I'm like, 'oh, shoot, I'm just going to go, go out and buy another one.' The difference was that in middle class individuals, uh, they tended to, uh, choose pens that other people didn't choose, and so the, the, the, the value for middle class individuals was distinctiveness. You know, so, for those of you who are in the middle class at this point, or, you know, uh, or people who have, uh, moved from lower classes to upper classes; one of the cultural adaptations that people from lower classes make into upper classes is this idea of the value of distinctiveness. That you can't wear or have anything else that other people have because that makes you a poser, or makes you not, not unique, and so choice is a much more relevant distinction in terms of, um, uh, uh, up, middle and upper class individuals, whereas similarity is much more relevant for those who are in lower class in, in, in lower class situations. And part of that is, uh, the need for inter, low, interdependence in the relationships as a method of survival. So, it, it, so it is tied to, um, tied to, uh, relationships and resilience. Well, I, I do use colloquial terms in terms of how to describe the different social classes. I think, in part, that's just how we understand it. Um, and I, I use that term and it's very, it's a loose confederation of the different variables that constitute different social classes, which are different depending on the context that you're in. And so, I can appreciate that, you know, uh, for somebody who, uh, is in Manhattan, I mean, I, your, I, conceptualization of social classes might be a little bit different than how I conceptualize things in Iowa City. Uh, I would say the economic downturn, uh, uh, starting in 2007, and the research on, uh, tax returns, um, has, bears this out; that people in the top ten percent did lose wealth. Their, their major loss was the result of capital gains, and the downturn in the stock market, whereas people who are in the lower and poorer classes lost actual money, dollar loss. And so that goes back to my original point was that people in the lower, poorer classes use, there was actually a steeper downturn for people in the affluent classes. And so, if you only looked at percentage loss, that's different, but if you change the metric and think, 'oh, if somebody's making hundreds of thousands of dollars and they lose something that they never had but was lost in a market that is outside of themselves. What affect does that have versus somebody who loses their job or loses, you know, if you're living on a couple hundred dollars a week on a, on a, on a pretty structured income, and you lose ten dollars, ten dollars is quite a bit of money, uh, in that felt dollar loss. So, the qualitative changes are much more severe in terms of, uh, in, when we think about the gradients in that sort of strata. There's a, there's an incredible value placed on, it, it's really, uh, uh, um, I think our, our society really sends, sort of, this dual conflicting message and it's a really odd paradox that we put it, were put into, which is, um, for, on the one end, uh, you, you're really, uh, I, you're really, um, there's a glamour put on hard work; sort of this individual effort that's put forward, and then the paradoxical notion is if you are, if you're wealthy, you know, you should enjoy it. You know, and it's not necessarily connected to that hard work. And, and the most, uh, salient, sort of, expression of that, i think, is, is, uh, you know, the last, um, presidential election where you saw these really odd machinations about, uh, how they, uh, try to re-, um, frame somebody like Mitt Romney as, as somebody who did a lot of hard work. Now, in his, and I, and I want to grant this (inaudible ) I think in, in that mindset, I think, their effort that they're expended they believe is the same, is the same as somebody who's working an hourly wage. Right? But, using, sort of, um, using, sort of, uh, the space shuttle metaphor and launching into, you're working in relatively, the lack of gravity and drag, and that gravity and drag has a lot to do with how much energy you expend. Right? So, you could do the same motion, but the motion down here is much different than the motion up there. I mean, it, just the physics of it are completely different, and I think that's, that's the other point to it is that you, you can have the same expression but the, the drag and the weight and the momentum and everything is much different. You know, so I, I appreciate that sort of physics notion of it. Two quick points: uh, the idea that you've experienced some kind of, um, economic trauma in the past and now are in a more privileged position, you know, working to maintain it because you don't want to go back, I think what, I conceptualize that as a kind of class (inaudible ) based traumas; sort of, the trauma that you experience as a result of bullying and other things, that you've, you know what it's like to be poor. You've now made it successful, and now everything that you're doing is a result of not wanting to go back. You know, that sort of sensitivity to that trauma earlier. The other piece, um, is, uh, uh, I, I think you've, you, you identified it, which is, uh, um, folks who have sort of gone up the economic ladder, uh, one, they don't have full access to all those different aspects that create stability; they only have access to one or two, money or education, but they don't have access to all the other things that provide them stability. And so, social mobility downward is much more possible. The other thing that creates the social mobility, the possibility of downward social mobility, is that there are many more individuals. When you're poor and you're working upwards, you're much more likely to be pulling other people up with you, and so the drag, you, that's that drag piece. And the research around African Americans and their social mobility upwards shows that that's pretty, uh, it's a pretty common occurrence that, you know, you're, you've got other people that you're pulling alongside. And that, that effort is much different than somebody who's born into, or has access to continually, the stable environment. You don't have that, sort of, sense of drag on your, on your mobility, so that's a big piece of it. So, I know that we're running out of time, and I appreciate your being here. Thank you very much.
