Introduction to Person-Centred Theory 

00:00:10
With Barry Kopp and Anthony Crouch 

00:00:15
ANTHONY CROUCH So, we are here today to talk about Person-Centered Counseling, umm… and you're a Person-Centered counselor. 

00:00:25
BARRY KOPP Yes. 

00:00:25
ANTHONY CROUCH Do you wanna say something about this approach and its origins? 

00:00:35
BARRY KOPP Yeah, I think it's always important, may be, we should think about, you know, when we are looking at any approach, you know, what is the purpose of counseling and… I guess for me, that is something about the… something about, one that client wanting to change something, the way they see or think or feel about something within themselves, or the way they behave, umm… Well, I suppose lengthy, so why the client even wants to come to counseling in the first place? And it can be for some thing like support, or recovery, to solve some kind of problem in their lives. Umm… self-awareness and all those sorts of things, clients may come for either knowingly or not knowing quite to start with, why, why they are in counseling. Umm… and I guess before Rogers, and at the time, the background was this psycho-analytical approach that is in the cognitive behavioral approach, umm… Rogers was concerned with like questioning the Chicago, you know, "What is it that makes counseling a factor?" And… Rogers and, Carl Rogers and his colleagues at that time umm… recorded thousands of sessions with clients, trying to find out what was that, what was that special ingredients that, that made counseling a factor. 

00:02:10
ANTHONY CROUCH It's very interesting that you started that by talking about change, which I know is really at the center of umm… contemporary research, therapeutic changes. It's all about that. Client comes with a certain problem or mental problem and they are… they ideally, they go over that at least feeling a lot better. Umm… so change you've started as Person-centered counselor by focusing on that, on change. And that being at the core, what counseling is? 

00:02:50
BARRY KOPP And I think at core of what, you know, person-centered therapy as you know is first accused of not having a research base, but actually Rogers was researching, you know, right at the very start. He was, you know, tapping into the latest technology, you know, recording was just coming into the 1940s and 1950s. 

00:03:10
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

00:03:10
BARRY KOPP And here he was recording umm… him and his colleagues, these sessions with clients to try and find out what was that ingredient, what was it that made the factor of therapy? 

00:03:20
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, and that was the other thing that I was going to highlight, really. So, that Rogers, was a researcher, and he founded counseling, but he didn't just make it up in his head, as you said he did a lot of research. And closely, closely observing, closely examining what was actually going on and what was effective and from that he develops the person-centered theory and practice. 

00:03:45
BARRY KOPP And in a sense that all comes from, you know, he comes from an agricultural background, he trains as administer, he pops over the road and starts doing the training as a counselor, with in the sacred analytical tradition. Umm… and then he goes on to work in family center, working with young people, and he is asked by one of the mothers that, you know, "Can I talk to you Dr. Roger?" umm… you know, Umm… "Do you do counseling for, for adults as well?" Umm… and where he is working, it's like, "Well, I know, you really worked with children but, I just want someone to listen to." And that something they're very different from the training that he has had, that somehow by having… you know, he agrees to meet this woman, so she just wants someone to hear what she is saying and then, you know… 

00:04:45
ANTHONY CROUCH Rather than, kind of treating her… 

00:04:50
BARRY KOPP Yes. 

00:04:50
ANTHONY CROUCH Rather than having a kind of prescription for, you know, first he kind of… person comes with depression, which is, which is a common I mean, health problem. 

00:05:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:05:00
ANTHONY CROUCH Umm… and rather than having a treatment for that depression, they will be kind of a pull out a box. 

00:05:05
BARRY KOPP Yes. 

00:05:05
ANTHONY CROUCH As the counselor and psychotherapist. It's about listening, it's not about treating, that's not the focus of, which is, which is… that's what Rogers change is really because, before that the focus was on treatment. 

00:05:25
BARRY KOPP And I guess the focus before is "I am the expert as the therapist" 

00:05:30
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

00:05:30
BARRY KOPP "I know what's wrong with you, I know what's right for you" and the focus changes into something that, actually it's the client that knows what's right for them, and given the right conditions the client is able to find their own way, and find their own answers. 

00:05:50
ANTHONY CROUCH The client is the expert on their own world, for themselves and their life. 

00:05:55
BARRY KOPP And in a sense, we are on a journey with the client. 

00:06:00
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, supporting them. 

00:06:00
BARRY KOPP Yes, supporting them to find their own answers, to find what is right for them, which may not be right for anyone else. 

00:06:10
ANTHONY CROUCH And for me, that's huge. That, that turning it on his head from experts with their treatments into the client as the expert, and listening to the client and supporting the client. It's huge, it's a paradigm shift to use a certain language, it's a, it is metaphor's Copernican it's where the earth is no longer the center of the universe. The doctor, the expert is no longer the center. The client becomes the center of the work. 

00:06:45
BARRY KOPP And I think it's sort of very interesting isn't it. When you look at research, contemporary research like Norcross, you know, where they are saying that's what 70% of factor therapy is about the client's engagement in the therapy. Umm… and although the therapists, the theory is, theoretical background that they use that's how playing important is not the major factor of client, that somehow it's the client's willingness to engage in therapy, that, that produces long term results, if you like. 

00:07:25
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, and umm, you kind of make sense at a practical level, because if it's, it's the client's world, it's not the counselor's world, and if you gonna change, they are gonna their life, if they are gonna change the way they handle the problems if they gonna change themselves, they have gonna do it, because it's their world. Umm… 

00:07:45
BARRY KOPP And they've got a want to do it… 

00:07:50
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, so there are some who may not to do it first, so then it's may be about support. 

00:07:55
BARRY KOPP To supporting their workout. 

00:07:55
ANTHONY CROUCH And having them to see what might be helpful, and that does involve them, umm… doing, doing lot of the work. And… yes you pointed out contemporary research and mentioned umm… John Norcross, who was the chair of a huge research task force in the States, which did conclude that umm… client, the client or the active client is the most important, the client engaging with the processes, what they call client factors are really key. 

00:08:30
BARRY KOPP And I think, to me that's quite interesting because when we go back to research, Rogers was there, you know, back in the 1940s and 1950s. Umm… you know, some of the conclusions they came out of theses recordings was that, it wasn't what the client talks about that was important, umm… it wasn't the theoretical orientation that was important, it's something about the attitude and relationship with the clients, although they haven't quite got to the stage where it's the client, it's something about the relationship that I have as a therapist, as a person centered therapist with the client. Umm… building actually a relationship, not a… although I guess, you know, from a psychoanalytical point view or continental point of view, there is a relationship. And there is something different about what Rogers is terming Relationship. It's a connection, it's, it's an quality almost in that relationship, or an attempt to build a rapo which is different from expert client, patient. Yeah. 

00:09:30
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. So, you transforms the doctor-patient relationship into much more collaborative, equal one, in which, the said client is at the center. And the counseling is all about listening and understanding and empathizing with the client's world in a way that they see the world. 

00:09:50
BARRY KOPP I'm recognizing the importance of the client in that process. umm… right back in the… like Rogers talked to them in 1950s. 

00:10:00
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, and… the relationship is also very important of those the skills and abilities, and the, uh… of the, the council psycho therapist, to build, to develop, to establish, and then to, uh… maintain a relationship to whatever difficult is in relationship and to end them, that's also important. We talked about how the client factors are the most important but the client engage with the process is the most important, but relationship is also very important. And umm… as you're saying Rogers in his research, in the early or in it is started in, umm… in this, in the 40s, nearly 40s, umm… to articulate this, umm… Person-Centred approach, umm… Rogers already focuses on that relationship, and it's taking quite long time it, we mentioned briefly the Norcross. Umm… task(ph) force(ph), it's taken a long time for researchers it's kind a catch up. So it's only really in the last decade or so particularly in the last few years, that has been a growing recognition of the importance of that the client and the importance of the relationship, umm… do you wanna say more about the relationship from the perspective of, of person's sensitive appoarch. 

00:11:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm, I guess what umm… what came out so over this research was, you know, he's, he's synchronized into what we know that was or term as the co-conditions. Well, there is something about the co-conditions, and hence or it's a little about these, umm… this three things are the, the sort of beside to that I as a therapist need to be congruent in the relationship which… 

00:11:55
ANTHONY CROUCH Can you just actually stop for a second, and explain that little more, cause may not quite… 

00:12:00
BARRY KOPP Understand what the….Yes, indeed. Umm… it's quite a complex, I do really, I think congruence because, you know, people can say what is something about being role in the relationship, but I guess from the… there is something about I'm in the relationship not meeting a mask, you're actually meeting me as a person, and again which, which is a big shift, so over the meeting the mask of a therapist if you like, you're actually meeting the therapist as a person, I'm somehow rove in this relationship, I'm in this relations review, I'm building this relationship review, so I'm meeting you as a person, you're meeting me as a person. 

00:12:45
ANTHONY CROUCH And before in that talk to patient relationship or expert patient relationship that mask would be the expert, right? 

00:12:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm… yes. 

00:12:55
ANTHONY CROUCH You, you, you're sitting there as an expert full of knowledge that you, you can kind of told out your patients. 

00:13:00
BARRY KOPP And analyzing your patient, I know what's best in that relationship was for Rogers(ph) there's always a thing of "Actually I don't know what's going on," you don't know what's going on, necessarily is we're in together while we, we can work on what's going on but I'm not the expert. 

00:13:15
ANTHONY CROUCH You know, that's obviously cannot, how can you possibly know what's going on before you've really listened. 

00:13:20
BARRY KOPP Yeah! Yeah. 

00:13:25
ANTHONY CROUCH Because, people are different. 

00:13:25
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm. 

00:13:25
ANTHONY CROUCH There each person is different, each person's depression is different, there maybe some commonalities, but really it needs to be a personalized understanding of that, that particular person's depression. 

00:13:40
BARRY KOPP Which brings the sense or maybe sacred condition of, of empathy, you know, can I somehow, I, I like the word and, and, and, and this is what the phrases I, I've sort of come to, to believe it over, over the years is, is can I somehow empathy, what my client is saying to me? Can I really experience such, and, you know, sometimes it really frustrates me when people say "Oh, you know I developed empathy with my client within 10 minutes of the session," and I'm just like, "You know, you gotta be joking me," umm… you know, we have (inaudible )of being really in that relationship with, above in the relationship, in the experience of the client, where you somehow you get that role connection, you both know, you're in the same place and sometimes it will be little word for it, but you go in and out, because the client is in and out of it that's why you count remained fully empathic with someone for a 50 minute session, over how many sections that you're having is always that struggle, umm… it's about like having that curtains or some other times with over looking through, then that curtain we can see maybe what's going on, umm… in silhouette, and then there are movements from what in the, what in the room with the client, and the client, and the therapist are together if you like. 

00:15:05
ANTHONY CROUCH Hmm. Yeah, I, I understand what you're saying in it, you know, I'm remembering for myself those experiences with personally and, and with clients, and I like your metaphor there of the net curtain it's, it's like and I've, and from my perspective anyway that most of the time we were all living behind the net curtains if not behind the mask, you know, often, quiet a kind of different mask from who we feel ourselves to be behind that mask. 

00:15:35
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm. 

00:15:35
ANTHONY CROUCH So that I care, it is in the sense, a kind of intermediate, umm… level of closeness where you can see through them, but maybe on it, as you saying on the silhouette whatever, but I'm just gonna say that I think what's you're saying that is, is very important but maybe how can we, how can, how can we talk about in the mind, mind and, you know, people watching my understand what we mean, what we've, what we've meaning, cause this is, it's quite difficult to talk about in that way. 

00:16:10
BARRY KOPP I think empathy is something that's quite difficult, it's… can I pop myself maybe to the, in the knees of, in the shoes of the client, can I somehow empathy is perhaps, can I somehow experience something about the client is experiencing. 

00:16:30
ANTHONY CROUCH But, for me there's more than that from what you, what you were saying was that the in that process of listening, and empathizing, and coming into this clients world and kind of walking along with them and sitting beside them, you do get, and this is, I think really important you do get those moments where you both recognize that you're actually together and the curtain, net curtain is gone. 

00:16:55
BARRY KOPP Absolutely, Mm-hmm, and I think nearly contemporary persons are the therapists like, umm… Davemils, Brian Ford would called as movements of mutuality that we worked towards this movements, umm… 

00:17:10
ANTHONY CROUCH The defense is the down… 

00:17:10
BARRY KOPP With defense is the down. Yeah, that the trust is that from the client as well, the client is trusting actually to go to that place with behind their own net curtain, because they always they see… 

00:17:20
ANTHONY CROUCH Are filming. 

00:17:20
BARRY KOPP …see it through their own net curtain, well, they do particularly want to give, uh… 

00:17:25
ANTHONY CROUCH And I can, I think that's really important point. 

00:17:25
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm. 

00:17:25
ANTHONY CROUCH It's not just about developing trust of the counselor, it's also about the client developing trust within themselves. 

00:17:35
BARRY KOPP Really, Yeah. Can I unlock that door? Can I go into that room which is a big scary place? Umm… and sometimes the work that we do with clients that sort of moving away maybe slightly from where we is working on the edge of that awareness. So, sometimes we need to work with what stopping us going us behind the net curtain before we can really move in or things maybe in another level of empathy is sometimes staying where the client is. 

00:18:00
ANTHONY CROUCH That the client doesn't want to take off the mask or open the net curtain… 

00:18:05
BARRY KOPP He's not ready to… 

00:18:05
ANTHONY CROUCH No, and it is really important that the counselor doesn't kind of try it… 

00:18:10
BARRY KOPP Yes, forced that way and… 

00:18:10
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

00:18:10
BARRY KOPP Yeah, yeah, umm… and I guess the third condition was, was what, what does matter turn to the unconditional positive for God. 

00:18:20
ANTHONY CROUCH And that's a, that's a fancy phrase and… 

00:18:25
BARRY KOPP It's a big phrase is an unconditional positive for God, umm… 

00:18:25
ANTHONY CROUCH Quite Jagony(ph). 

00:18:30
BARRY KOPP Umm… What does that mean? Umm… and I guess it's about maybe you could do analogy with perhaps the love that a parent has for the child that it's should be unconditional, that I love my child no matter what, but that doesn't meant to say approve of what they are doing or have done is something about a very special regard for that person, so when a… 

00:19:00
ANTHONY CROUCH I wish includes for example, what pops into my mind immediately when I say that is which includes for example, challenging them. 

00:19:05
BARRY KOPP Yes. 

00:19:05
ANTHONY CROUCH Being willing to challenge them, being brave enough to challenge them. 

00:19:10
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm. 

00:19:10
ANTHONY CROUCH When maybe they're not gonna hear it. 

00:19:15
BARRY KOPP Which is the congruence I guess, competing, that umm… about the client needs to experience my regard for them, and I sort of remember, umm… years ago when I was working with young people leaving car and… one of things that struck me was, you know, working with 16 to18 year olds quite difficult group anyway, quite challenging, but there was something about if you would, they knew if you're genuinely there for them. Despite that behavior, they, there was something about those staff that were genuinely working with them, and genuinely cared and had regard for them, despite that behavior they didn't quite play up as much. And yeah, somehow if there was people who were working there, who would move for that for a power trip, they really acted up for, because they somehow know that actually they were in those, for that interest if you like that's sort of quite complicated I think, but I think I know what I'm, what I'm saying. 

00:20:30
ANTHONY CROUCH What for me, what I was thinking almost it's, it's really about respecting them as persons… 

00:20:35
BARRY KOPP Yes, yes. 

00:20:35
ANTHONY CROUCH This is a person, they may had experiences which have shape and are in certain kind of way, they may be in rebellion, you know, in Late Hard lessons what I've heard what they all thought it figures, but beneath all of that there is a person… 

00:20:50
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm and that's what we respect, that's what we're giving the un-conditionality to, to the person. 

00:20:55
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

00:20:55
BARRY KOPP Not necessarily the behavior. 

00:20:55
ANTHONY CROUCH And a person who has meaning, a person who like me, I'm a person, I want people to value me, I want people to respect me, I want, you know, rather than in the, in the docs patients relation or the expert patient relationship, the patient is a bit more when object. 

00:21:15
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm, absolutely, and there's something about if I as a client can start to fill that regard, fill that value then something can also start to shift. If someone is understanding where I am in my terms, something starts to shift, and if I can be real in that relationship so there might be times when I might say to a client "I don't understand," I got that wrong that's possibly not something that traditionally psycho analytical, umm… therapist might say but there's something about as a Person-Centred Therapist if I can say that, that I'm not right, I have got that wrong or yeah, I know, that, that sounds a difficult, difficult puff you take it, but as the, but there's something about the respect as well that… 

00:22:10
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, it's almost… 

00:22:10
BARRY KOPP I'm respecting myself and the client. 

00:22:10
ANTHONY CROUCH It was going kind a going through my mind as you, we, we've started off by talking about, uh… change but we then went on to say that the really important factor in making those changes as the client. 

00:22:25
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm. 

00:22:25
ANTHONY CROUCH And is always like your saying that if the counselor through their unconditional positive regard if they're in a fact believe in this person… 

00:22:35
BARRY KOPP Yes, mm-hmm. 

00:22:35
ANTHONY CROUCH And that person if he is genuine then that person will feel that, and if they feel believed in it's not like it gives them a kind of hope. 

00:22:50
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm. But I think what upon there is I have to as a therapist genuinely have a regard for that client. If he isn't genuine and if I try to somehow fake it the client is not going to experience that genuine relationship, that genuine regard. 

00:23:05
ANTHONY CROUCH So immediately I am thinking that's pretty odd. 

00:23:10
BARRY KOPP That it is, it's I'll, I'll, and I think, you know, people, lot of people who'll live with that criticism that, well you need to press this and this is a bit fluffy, but actually I think is already difficult way of working. 

00:23:20
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

00:23:20
BARRY KOPP Because I haven't got anything too necessarily, I haven't got tool box to hang, you know, to, you know, or well, you know, that I'm gonna analyze you gonna do this to you, actually I'm constantly in this relationship. 

00:23:35
ANTHONY CROUCH But also, you know, that at first you may not have that unconditional positive regard except to the theoretical effort. 

00:23:40
BARRY KOPP And that, that's was part of voting that relationship. 

00:23:45
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, and I, I… 

00:23:45
BARRY KOPP …doesn't it, it's, it's getting passed the, the things the client is presenting which, which may… 

00:23:50
ANTHONY CROUCH A masks in defenses as well, no, not as similar representing… 

00:23:55
BARRY KOPP Yeah, and the things that, that great with us that we might disapprove all the, how to we get through, through that so that we can help the regard for the client. 

00:24:05
ANTHONY CROUCH And I suppose the other thing I'm thinking is that for my in-experience that process of developing the empathic relationship of, of coming along the client it's, it can take time but it's, it's also a process of coming to respect, and belief in this person, because, you know, things that didn't sense that makes sense for example, and it's much more easy to forgive, you know, difficult behaviors when you understand where they're coming from, and… 

00:24:40
BARRY KOPP Wish I guess leads this to, you know, that what is coming from an agricultural background, you know, sort, sort of believed in the idea that, you know, we can all grow, umm… that we can self actualize, we can be the best that we can possibly… 

00:25:00
ANTHONY CROUCH You can bit of a jogany phrase, uh… 

00:25:00
BARRY KOPP Yeah, or we can be the best that we possibly can be I guess self actualization but given the right conditions so we have nurtured and, and to use his sort of analogy potatoes, you know, if, if you take a potato and you give the potato what it needs to become a good specimen, an A grade specimen of the potatoes that it's watered, it's nurtured, it's given away it's farming things that a potato needs then you will get a good potato. If you cast that potato into a cell really, ignore it and it's in a dark place and it's not really… 

00:25:35
ANTHONY CROUCH On substance or saying. 

00:25:40
BARRY KOPP Yeah it's not, it's not nurtured, it will still grow, but it will not grow perhaps in the best way it can but it will be striving to do something… 

00:25:50
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

00:25:50
BARRY KOPP with the conditions that it's being given. And I guess either that when leads the sound to the idea that, that those conditions of work, those conditions are valued that we interject from others through out our life. We try and fit in with society around us. So again if as a baby what we are nurtured, we're given the love we've had will change, we, also those things that a baby's needs then as a, and as it grows up you're given all the positive things you need them. Generally speaking you should be able to self actualize in some way, you can become the person that you want to be or can be, and I guess if aren't given all that nurturing, all the right things if, if you're not fledged(ph), you're trained to, you're not given the right school, and you're told that you're the worst possible child either, but you start to believe that and you sort of interject these values from all those. Umm… and you start to believe things which aren't also feel like with this… with our true-self, you know, and this make self sort of who you really are. And overtime as you come to believe these conditions umm… you build a barrier between yourself, your role self and who, and who you're projecting if you like to society, to other people. And that may work, that will work quite successfully until something comes along and it breaks and you're left with, "Well, actually who am I? What am I?" you know, where do you… "Who am I now without…" 

00:27:40
ANTHONY CROUCH So in a way you're talking about someone growing up and becoming incongruent. 

00:27:40
BARRY KOPP Yes. 

00:27:45
ANTHONY CROUCH That they've got social mask or masks, and they've got other things going on inside them I mean, that's very different that there is a, there's a conflict really, there's an internal conflict, an internal difficulty which can at some point be problematic apart from the fact that living like that probably isn't that great either. 

00:28:05
BARRY KOPP Although perhaps other time it feels right. 

00:28:05
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, always especially… 

00:28:05
BARRY KOPP And it's okay, why does this working, it's working for… even if it's dysfunctioned or it is, it is sort of working until something comes along and it no longer is working, and that's when I guess people come to therapy. 

00:28:20
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, then from… I was gonna say from my perspective that if you don't know any different then how would you know, you know, what's it's like to be more congruent with yourself, more peace having less of an internal conflict. Umm… so as a kind of summary of the core conditions and the, and the theory of, you know, you kind a pay core theory of person centered counseling, for person centered approach. It's very much about recognizing that the client is the active ingredient if you like the, the client needs to engage with the process, they need to grow and change, same kind of thing growth and change, moving towards uh… self actualization which is a bit like kind of flourishing, or fulfillment or whatever, umm… and that the counselor supports the client in that process by providing them with the kind of therapeutic environment which includes these core conditions. 

00:29:35
BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:29:35
ANTHONY CROUCH Uh… the development of the empathic relationship.

BARRY KOPP Mm-hmm. And I think that's really important is the core conditions that work in isolation but they work together, you can't sort of say "Well, I might do better empathy or might do better congruent," so I give some unconditional regard that I've got to work with those three all the time, and if something isn't quite working maybe like the unconditional regard then I need to look at what my block is that is stopping me entering that kinds were what would having regard for that client, so that I can be there with that client, umm… 

00:30:15
ANTHONY CROUCH So when you say that the one thing that, that best in the mind is that we have a very emphasized is that another kind of common known factor cross over the approach is, is the what's called the therapist factors or the counselor factors. 

00:30:30
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:30:30
ANTHONY CROUCH And that includes what you're saying that was it… do with the self awareness of the, of the counselor and their, and also their abilities to offer congruence or whatever. So there are those three elements ready. That's the and the importance of the client in engaging the process the client factors, does the relationship the therapeutic relationship? 

00:31:00
BARRY KOPP The client experiencing that relationship? 

00:31:00
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

00:31:00
BARRY KOPP Yeah! 

00:31:05
ANTHONY CROUCH But there's also the counselor or the therapist and the factors the contribute therapy change there and some of those are well, one of those important actually is that we guess the kind of belief and, and the hope for this client in the counselor, the belief in the client and the hope for them. 

00:31:25
BARRY KOPP And I think that's a really important, important for the, as a therapist I guess may as a Person-Centred therapist my aim is to believe the client can change, it's not for me to said where the clients change(ph) changed to but it's the belief that the client can change. 

00:31:40
ANTHONY CROUCH By providing this therapeutic environment of this co-conditions so that they can, so they've got their the water, and the, and the soil to grow, and the sun obviously.
