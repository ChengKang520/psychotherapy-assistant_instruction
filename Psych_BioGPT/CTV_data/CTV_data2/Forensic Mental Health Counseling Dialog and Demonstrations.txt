Forensic Mental Health Counseling: Dialog and Demonstrations 

00:00:00
by Kevin Nadal, Ph.D. 

00:00:35
[music] 

00:00:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hi, my name is Dr. Kevin Nadal. I'm an assistant professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, as well as the Deputy Director of the Forensic Mental Health Counseling Program. There's a new field called Forensic Mental Health Counseling, which basically combines the concepts of forensic psychology with the concepts of mental health counseling. Mental health counseling really focuses on empowering clients, understanding their development, um, and really focusing on the relationship between the counselor and the client. Often times in forensic psychology, uh, counselors and, or other mental health practitioners often criminalize their clients, so with forensic mental health counseling it's quite the opposite. It's understanding that their clients, offenders, or victims, um, are human beings and that they can benefit from therapy just like anyone else can. 

00:01:40
SCENARIO 1: In this demonstration, Dr. Kevin Nadal conducts a counseling session with Rich, a sexual offender just released from jail and mandated to counseling. Dr Nadal employs humanistic theory, focusing on development rapport, showing empathy and unconditional positive regard, empowering Rich by using strength based techniques. 

00:01:45
[music] 

00:01:45
DR.KEVIN NADAL So Rich, this is your second time here. You came in last week and I just wanted to check in with how that experience was for you and what it feels like coming back here. 

00:02:15
RICH I mean, you know, it was a little weird talking to somebody about, you know, stuff I've been been through the past eight years, but uh, you know it's nothing I'm not used to so, at the same time uh, you know, I was just like whatever, you know. I mean I have to do it so. 

00:02:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah, and you're mandated to come here as part of your uh, probation. 

00:02:40
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:02:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL How does that feel, to, to feel to be mandated to come here? 

00:02:45
RICH I mean, yeah it's no shock right? You know, I mean, I, I did what I did, I served my time but you know, at the same time it kind of feels like all right enough already. Like, eight years, I did eight years already. You know, I was, I was a kid at the time, I was 19. 

00:03:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:03:00
RICH So, having to go and get mandated, talk to someone,you know, no offense, but it's just like sometimes it feels like a little overkill, you know. I already gotta, you know. So... 

00:03:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. I know that last week we really didn't talk about, uh, the situation and, um, you said, uh, right now that you were 19, um, when you were arrested. 

00:03:25
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:03:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um, you know, would you be open to talking about it today with me? 

00:03:25
RICH I mean, it's, it's a little hard to talk about just because, you know, like I had to have to think about it for the past eight years, regret it you know. I don't talk to my family because they think I'm just some kind of weirdo, you know. I, I have to tell everybody I, I try to get jobs from, you know, that I was in jail for what. You know, wherever I move. You know, so it's, I feel like I just don't wanna, don't even wanna talk about it, you know. 

00:03:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. Well, I mean, we don't have to talk about it today, um, but it would be something that might be helpful for you to, to talk about with me, just so I can get a sense of, um, your perspectives. Uh, you know, what the whole, um, process was like for you, you know, getting arrested, going to court, going to prison. 

00:04:15
RICH Yeah, it just, I mean, the process was, you know, shitty. You know, I mean getting arrested as a 19 year old kid, you know. Everybody else you know is going on, doing their life you know, going to college or whatever, and then I'm just, it's like frozen in time for eight years , and then prison was no picnic you know. So, you know, I mean, I don't even know, you know, where to start with that. It's just like, you know, it's one big mess. You know what I mean? 

00:04:55
DR.KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:04:55
RICH One big mess. So, now I'm just, I feel like I'm finally trying to move on with life and yet it's like they won't let me, you know. I gotta mandate counseling, I gotta tell everybody, you know, who I am, what's this and that, like I define it. Might as well stamp, you know, put a stamp on my head says you know, you know, fuck this guy, you know what I mean? Don't, this guy, you know, don't hire him, don't talk to him, anything like that you know? I mean, I don't have any friends right now or anything like that, and it doesn't matter, you know? I mean I didn't really have many in prison either . But it's just like, you know. 

00:05:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. I mean you said that you don't get to talk about this with anyone? 

00:05:35
RICH Yeah. 

00:05:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, what's it like, really starting to talk about it with me? 

00:05:40
RICH I mean, I don't know, it's a, I don't know if, it's a little weird, you know, 'cuz I, you know, I'm not used to talking about this stuff with anybody. 

00:05:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:06:00
RICH But, you know it's like there are guys in prison that I've, you know, talk to and these guys were in for a lot worse then, you know, what I did, and you know, again it just makes me frustrated so I feel like, you know, I don't know it's, I don't even know if I'm making sense, you know what I mean? 

00:06:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:06:15
RICH It's just like I don't even know if I would talk to you if I wasn't mandated you know what I'm saying, I feel like I'm more closed. 

00:06:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Yes. Mm hm. Well, how do you feel about what you did? 

00:06:30
RICH I mean yeah, I feel guilty, you know? I feel like shamed and whatnot but at the same time it's like I was kid you know, and uh, so, you know, it's hard for me still to kinda, you know, think about it over, and over again. I feel like I all right I thought about it enough You know, it was eight years in jail so it's like, you know, how much more you want me to think about it, you know? So... 

00:07:00
DR.KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm, yeah. 

00:07:00
RICH It's not like I can keep living it over, and over and then saying, you know, I shouldn't of done that. You know what I'm saying? 

00:07:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. I mean, you know there's a couple things I'm thinking about is, one is, um, that you, you don't want to necessarily talk about this. It was something that happened a long time ago, and, and that sort of thing, and at the same time like I, I'm kinda curious about, you know, hearing your perspective about, you know, what happened, how you felt about at the time. So, I mean, maybe it might be helpful for you to just kinda tell me about what happened eight years ago, the, how you got arrested, how you got caught, what was the situation that led up to it? 

00:07:40
RICH Yeah. You know I, I try to not to relive it too much, you know , but basically what happened was I, I was out with my friends, you know, and we were partying at some, uh, you know, like a house party something like that, and this bunch of girls there, and one of 'em, uh, you know, she was like, looking at me. She's, you know, she looked pretty good to me, you know? I could tell she was a little young but I wasn't, you know, I didn't know exactly how young, and uh, so, you know. We started flirting and whatnot, and everybody's drinking and stuff and, uh, well basically, you know like, we just ended up going back, um, to my place, you know. And, uh, and then we kept in touch a little bit and, and, and um, like you know we just would have sex, you know. That was pretty much all it was, you know, but then what happened is her parents I think, they somehow found out, you know, and, uh, and it turned, you know, she was, she was 15. I was 19, you know. For a 19 year old kid though, you know, sometimes you're taught, you know, I can't tell the difference, you know, between, 15, 18, 19, whatever, you know. It's just like legal, you know, just this, she looked older I think but, I don't know. Anyway, once the parents found out, they pressed charges and, uh, so you know, I was found guilty and whatnot, and, uh, you know, had to go, I had to go to prison,you know, and everybody fucking, you know, pretty much you know, like I said put a stamp on my head you know? Just like this guy, you know, he's a nut or whatever. You know, and I don't see, I mean personally though, you know, between you and me, it's like this is a good looking girl. It's not like she was 12, you know, she's 15. I grant it's a little young but, I mean, I think young girls, you know, thinking young girls are attractive doesn't, you know, doesn't seem that weird. I don't know. I mean, I understand the age thing, you know, but at the same time it's like, sometimes I can't tell, you know, from 15 to 18, 25, you know You can't tell, you know. 

00:10:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL So, so Rich, let me, um, understand a little bit more. So you said that you had the, a sexual relationship with this 15 year old. 

00:10:15
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:10:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um, I, I'm a little confused because you said you got eight years, um, uh, in prison for that. Could you tell me a little bit more about whether there was more to this situation? 

00:10:30
RICH Well, the thing is that, uh, we had sex a couple of times, and then one of the last times she was like, you know, no, and I don't wanna. You're too old and this and that. All of a sudden like decides she doesn't wanna. Like we are almost about to have sex, you know, and then I was like I mean what do you mean no? We're having sex already, you know, and so basically she accused me of rape. So, that's why I got up to about eight years, you know. So... 

00:11:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm. So, I, you left that part of the story out the first time that you started to talk about it. Can you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:11:15
RICH Well, I mean, it's like one thing I feel like to, you know, say you had sex with a younger girl but another thing to be accused of rape too, you know. 

00:11:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:11:30
RICH So, it's like I feel like, you know, that I get an extra bad rap for that, you know. Uh, and it's just like I said before I just feel like, you know, tired of being labeled, you know, so... 

00:11:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm hmm. What does it feel like to be labeled like that? 

00:11:50
RICH I mean, frustrating, you know? It makes me, makes me angry, you know? I just wanna I would, you know, I would, I can't go back and change it, you know, so what the hell am I supposed to do, you know? It's like I gotta carry this with me my whole life, and, it, it sucks, sucks. 

00:12:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Yeah. Well, I mean, let's talk a little bit about just, uh, what happened afterwards. So, you were convicted, you, you, um, went to prison. Uh, what was that experience like for you? 

00:12:30
RICH Well, you know, the typical stories of prison. You know, don't bend over in the shower, you know. Let's just say it wasn't easy, you know. It's not like all fun and games. It's not like, you know, you just go and you have TV, and you get free food and this and that. A lot people paint this picture of prison, like, oh, it's not that bad or whatever. You know they joke around. It, it wasn't, uh, it was not a walk in the park, let's just say that, you know. Certain things that , you know, certain things that's probably gonna stay with me for a long time, you know. 

00:13:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Hmm. 

00:13:10
RICH So, and you have to, I mean, I had to learn, you know, how to take care of myself, you know what I mean? And then so eight years I feel like it just made me a harder person, you know? I don't even know what's the use, what's the use in that, you know. To put somebody in that, like, position so, I don't know. 

00:13:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm hmm. So you said there's certain things that you'll take with you. You haven't shared that with anybody? 

00:13:40
RICH Nah, I've never really talked about it. I mean, just aside from a few, a few people I knew. I wouldn't call them friends, that I made in prison you know. Uh, just like things I've seen, you know, fights, people killing each other, you know, raping, whatever. You name it. It's just, it's not a, eh, there's no kinda awakening, you know. I know a lot of guys that try to sell this story about prison. Oh, I went and I read the bible everyday, you know, and now I'm a new man, this and that. I mean, eh, it's changed me. I wouldn't say I'm a new man, but it's changed me to be more I guess, I mean harsher in a way, you know, more closed. 

00:14:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm hmm. Hmm, how did you spend your days? 

00:14:35
RICH I mean, you know, for the most part it was just like, you know, everybody gets up at the same time, you eat, um, they, you know, and they had, had us doing things, like you know, scrubbing floors and this and that, and then there was, um, like you know, we could do things like work out, you know. So I spent a lot of time to weight lift so I could be stronger if I needed to fight somebody, you know, um... 

00:15:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Did you get in fights with people? 

00:15:05
RICH Yeah, yeah I got, yeah, I got in fights. Um, you know, by the, the end of the time I was stronger and I knew how to fight, you know, so people wouldn't really mess with me. But, in the beginning you know I had, you know, people definitely take advantage of oh, he's the new guy, you know. Let's just beat him up, you know. Um, so, and, and prison guards, they don't do nothing about it, you know. They say they do. They come in at the last minute, right before your, you know, skull was broken. 

00:15:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Did you get hurt? 

00:15:40
RICH Yeah, a few times, yeah. 

00:15:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL What was that like? 

00:15:45
RICH I mean... 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:50
RICH I, I couldn't do nothing about it, you know. 

00:16:05
[sil.] 

00:16:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL I know you said that you wanted to probably take these things with you and here I am asking you about the experiences. What, what is it like have, talking about it? 

00:16:25
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. It's weird. You know, it's weird, you know, 'cuz I'm used to, to just holding it inside, trying to push it out of my mind. 

00:16:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:35
RICH So, it's, it's weird. 

00:16:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL I notice that you said you don't talk to your family anymore either, that you don't have very many friends, and so you don't get to talk about this with anybody. 

00:16:45
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.,I think, I think it might be better that way though, you know. 

00:16:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:16:50
RICH Yeah, I don't know. 

00:16:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, one thing that you could do is, you know, we have these sessions and, you know, you are mandated to come here but maybe we could make the most of these sessions by you talking about some of these things. I think that, you know, counseling is helpful because you get to explore these feelings that maybe you don't get to talk about. 

00:17:15
RICH I mean, why is that helpful? I don't understand. Why is like reliving everything gonna be helpful to me? You know, I know they say that but, you know, I don't understand. 

00:17:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Well, how is it repressing everything, or just bottling everything up? how is that helping you? 

00:17:30
RICH Oh, I feel like, you know, if I could push it out my mind then it's at least, you know, I'm not feeling, you know, as torn by it. I don't know. 

00:17:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:17:40
RICH And... 

00:17:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, I mean, maybe this is something that we can at least try out, see if this might be something that could help you, you know. In my experience is that it does help people, um, so, you know this is something that maybe you can just take that risk, challenge yourself to, to share some of these things, think about some of these things that you try to push out. 

00:18:05
RICH Oh, man. I got no choice right? So... 

00:18:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:10
RICH All right. You know, I'll do what I can. 

00:18:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL I mean, you know, the, the other thing is like, I, I'm just curious as to know about how, um, you feel about, uh, the situation, you getting arrested. Is, was this a one time incident or do you think that this is, would you do it again? Um, meet a young girl and have sex with her, and rape her? 

00:18:35
RICH What? if I said yes, I mean, where, where's the cops? You know, are you gonna bring them back in here? Of course, I wouldn't be stupid enough to say yeah. I mean this was only one time. I mean, I can't lie. I'm not gonna say that I don't think, you know, you know, young girls are still hot, you know what you mean? 

00:18:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:18:55
RICH But, I feel like, you know, I know better than to, you know, mess around with them. I mean, consequences and all that, you know. 

00:19:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:19:10
RICH I just try to stay out of trouble. 

00:19:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Well, you know, as we talked about last time that, you know, the all of our sessions are confidential, um, that I, I'm not gonna tell anyone things you talk about in here. 

00:19:20
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

00:19:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um, but, I, you know, I think it might be helpful for you to, to talk about if you have these feelings, um, just so you could sort through them instead of, um, maybe making bad decisions that might, uh, or you might end up where you started and go back to prison. 

00:19:35
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. But at the same time it's like, I mean if I tell you I had these feelings, isn't that, doesn't that, does that make me something like a crazy person or something? 

00:19:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm. I mean, it doesn't make you a crazy person. I mean, but it is something that, you know, would be helpful for you to just kind of sort through so that we can understand, you know, what it means for you and how it affects you. So, I'm glad that you came back, um, to see me. I know that you're mandated and I also know that you can come and see any other counselor, um, but I, I think that this is something that, you know, we can work through together, and you know, be more than happy to, to speak with you, um, on a weekly basis, um, and I, you know, I, I do think that, uh, you're showing a lot the strength in terms of opening up to me. I know you don't have to, um, uh, but you are. 

00:20:30
RICH (crosstalk) Thanks. 

00:20:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um, and I, you know, I think that, uh, another thing, um, for, for us to just understand is, um, that you, you are hurting, you do have emotions, you know, it sounds like, uh, being labeled, not talking to your family, all these things are stressing you out and, and causing you some strife. Um, so even though you committed a crime, to know that you're still a human and, um, and that's something that I just wanna validate, um, with you. 

00:21:00
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:21:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL So, what do you think, uh, you wanna gain from, from our work together, or time together? 

00:21:05
RICH You know, it'd be nice to know if, you know, I mean, if, if I'm, if I'm not a weirdo or something, you know. 

00:21:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:21:20
RICH You know, I guess, I mean, I don't, I never really thought about, you know, what I could gain from this. It's always just seemed like I needed to do, you know. So, I guess I don't really have any expectations so to speak, you know. 

00:21:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL What have your past counseling sessions been like? 

00:21:40
RICH I mean, similar kinds of stuff, but I always felt judged a little bit. 

00:21:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:21:50
RICH I don't get that from you as much which is, hmm, it's nice. But, you know I've been, in the other sessions, people just all it seemed like all they wanted to know is what I did, what I was thinking, you know. That kind of thing, you know. 

00:22:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, well, I mean, it's my hope that, that this could be an, a, a safe space for you, a nonjudgmental place, um, for you to talk about everything. Like I said, like I, I don't like, um, labeling people and so you're not a crazy person like, you, um, might of said earlier. Um, but you're still a person and, you know, this could be some, a way for us to just talk a little bit more and, um, help you to sort through some of these, these feelings that you have. 

00:22:40
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. That feels, that feels good to hear doc, you know what I mean. 

00:22:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:22:45
RICH You know, thinking about myself as a nut all the time, you know. 

00:22:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:22:50
RICH It's nice to hear that, you know, somebody doesn't think I'm crazy. So... 

00:22:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. All right. So why don't we, uh, end here and we can meet, um, starting next week and start meeting regularly from that point on. 

00:23:05
RICH (crosstalk) Yeah. Okay. 

00:23:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL All right, cool. Thank you Rich. 

00:23:10
RICH Thanks. 

00:23:10
In this session, Dr. Nadal employs humanistic approaches in working with his client, Rich. Notice how he attempted to build a rapport with the client, while still gently challenging Rich whenever discrepancies arose. Dr. Nadal also used "here and now" techniques by constantly asking Rich how he was feeling in the moment, while also encouraging and using positive language to remind Rich that he is a human being... 

00:23:10
...Oftentimes, it is hard for therapists to look past the offender's crime. However, as a forensic mental health counselor, it is important to remember to see one's clients as human beings, understand how their environment has influenced their development, and empower them to reach their full potential. 

00:23:10
SCENARIO 2: In this demonstration, Dr. Kevin Nadal counsels Cammie, a survivor of rape, who is in her first session with Dr. Nadal. Dr. Nadal employs humanistic client-centered techniques to the session. The client is encouraged to explore her feelings about the incident for the first time, and Dr. Nadal gives her room and space to share her narrative while listening and offering unequivocal support. 

00:23:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL So, Cammie, what brings you in to see me today? 

00:24:35
CAMMIE Um, my, um, my friend said that I should, um, well, not my, my friend, I um, I thought that maybe I should, um, come in to talk to somebody about, um, like therapy stuff. 

00:24:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. Yeah, um, what specifically did you want to talk about? 

00:25:00
CAMMIE Um, a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff has been going on lately so it just, it's been kinda hard to deal with everything. 

00:25:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:25:10
CAMMIE Um, you know, college, and um, so I just, it's just been hard so I just thought it would be good to, to come in and speak to, um, to somebody about things. 

00:25:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Okay. And I know that you went to your college counseling center and they're the ones that referred you to me. 

00:25:30
CAMMIE Mm-hmm. 

00:25:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um, was there something that you talked about with them, specifically? 

00:25:35
CAMMIE Uh I, I, um, well my friend told me to talk to them. Um, she said that it would be good for me to talk to someone other than her, um, about what's going on in my, in my life now. 

00:25:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:25:45
CAMMIE So, um, I talked to them and then, um, and then after we talked they, they said that it would be good to to see somebody outside of, um, out, outside of there because it was, um, it was like a lot, you know? It was a lot for me to talk about. Um, it's a lot going on. 

00:26:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. What's going on? 

00:26:10
CAMMIE Um, I just, um, you know, I, I um, go out. I went out, um, and and I met some people. I met this one person and it just didn't go well. So, it's just kind of made it hard. 

00:26:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:26:30
CAMMIE To... 

00:26:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) What, yeah, what do you mean by it didn't go well? 

00:26:30
CAMMIE Um, I, um, I, I met this guy and, um, he, he was not, um, a good guy. That's, that's about it. So, um, what do, um, what do you do here? 

00:26:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. Well I'm a counselor here, um, at this clinic. Um, you know, it's, and I'm here to listen to clients about whatever they want to talk about. Um, have you been in counseling before? 

00:27:05
CAMMIE Um, no just, just that, that time at school, yeah. 

00:27:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Just that one. Yeah. It sounds like you are struggling to talk about something that you wanted to come in and talk about. 

00:27:20
CAMMIE Um, yeah. It's not, I mean, I only talked to my friend about it. 

00:27:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:27:25
CAMMIE And, um, she kinda told me to, um, to tell them at school and I, um, that's kind of, that's kind of all I've talked it about so, um, so like I said I've, I've never done this before, so I don't really know like, how I'm supposed, how I'm supposed to talk to you really. 

00:27:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk)Okay. Sure. Okay. Yeah. So, we could talk about what it is later but maybe we could just start off by just talking about what it feels like to actually to just have come here. What was that process like, how do you feel right now as you're sitting with me? 

00:28:00
CAMMIE I guess it's just, you don't talk too much and just have somebody listen the whole time, so that's kinda strange to me, 'cuz usually when people talk the other person is saying and then I, and then I, so, um, it's kinda strange to me, for me to be talking in the I the whole time and for you to be just sitting there listening and I don't, and that, and you're not gonna talking about yourself at all. 

00:28:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Sure. Mm hmm. 

00:28:25
CAMMIE So I don't, it's kind of weird to think that I'm just talking out loud about myself. 

00:28:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and, and it is weird. It's a different type of process, you know, counseling, and that, you know, there's just one person talking, um, but at the same time it's also your opportunity to, to share, to vent, to, to sort through, um, things that are going on inside of you and so that's what, you know, I'm here for, to, to listen to you. Um, you know, with the other relationships, your friendships, your friend, uh, your relationships with family members, you know, that's where, you know, we were able to talk about things and have it be more, uh, reciprocal back and forth dialogue. But here, you know, this is your time to, to really talk about what you want to talk about so I, I recognize that it's a different process but, you know I think, that you you deserve this time to, to share. 

00:29:20
CAMMIE (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. And do you do this a lot? 

00:29:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I mean I have a lot of clients here, um, that I see, several clients a day. 

00:29:25
CAMMIE Okay. 

00:29:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL I've been doing this for quite some time. 

00:29:30
CAMMIE And do, do you talk to women a lot? 

00:29:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I have a lot of clients of, of both men and women, different age groups, different racial groups, lots of different stories and reasons why they come in. 

00:29:45
CAMMIE Did you have, like, do some kind of you know, training or something so that you could talk to, to women better? 

00:29:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm, yeah. In my training, you know, we definitely have, uh, been prepared in how to work with, with different groups and particularly with women, and you know, I know especially for me as a man that I, um, am very careful and, and I try to, to make sure that I provide a safe environment for women to talk about whatever they want to talk about and that's the same for you. I hope that you talk about whatever you want to talk about today. 

00:30:20
CAMMIE Well 'cuz my, you know, my stuff is more about like, you know, it's, it's more like about being a, a, a young woman I guess. 

00:30:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:30:25
CAMMIE Um, and a lot of what's a problem for me these days is like how sometimes there's, you know, a lot of men that aren't that great so, um, I just, you know, kinda wanted to know if you've, you know, worked with women and if you've, um, you're familiar with it, the issues that many young women faced today with, with guys. 

00:30:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Yeah. Sure. It sounds like something bad happened with a guy? 

00:30:55
CAMMIE Yeah. 

00:31:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:31:00
CAMMIE Yeah, it was really bad. Um, I haven't talked to my, like, family about it at all. 

00:31:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:31:10
CAMMIE Um, 'cuz I don't think it's something, it's something that they would, I mean, they wouldn't want to hear about it at all, or I don't know what they would do. I really don't know what they would do. Um, 'cuz you know I came to school to, um, to do really well and I don't want them to hear that I'm not doing well. Um, they, they really wouldn't like that so, um, you know, being, um, sort of not having a, a good time is not, is not something that, well not a good time but not being productive at, at school. So I can't talk to them really about what's going on with me right now, um, especially my dad. Um, I can't really talk to him either. So, um, yeah um, I had um, sorry this is just hard to talk about. 

00:32:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Take your time. 

00:32:15
CAMMIE I had this guy, you know, at a, at a, a party, um, like, you know, force himself on, on me, so it's just, it's been hard. Yeah. 

00:32:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL How long ago was that? 

00:32:30
CAMMIE It was, um, a few, a few days ago. It was a few days ago. 

00:32:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:32:40
CAMMIE Um, I haven't seen him. I haven't seen him around. Um, well, I haven't been, um, going out much. 

00:32:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:32:45
CAMMIE Um, 'cuz like I said, I don't feel good about it. 

00:32:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Sure. 

00:32:50
CAMMIE So I haven't been going out much so that's why I haven't seen him which is good, um, but I saw my friend like I told you, um, and I just, um, I did go, um, she had me go to, to tell the police about it though. 

00:33:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:33:10
CAMMIE And I don't, I don't really want to do that you know? I, I don't like, um, talking about it at all. 

00:33:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:33:20
CAMMIE So, yeah. I don't really even, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna deal with it at all. 

00:33:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Well first of all, I think it's really, really brave for you to come here and to talk with me, and to share with me the, what you've gone through. Um, I think that it's definitely a, a sign of your strength and I definitely feel that, you know, and I think we could talk about it and hopefully this could at least help you to, to again to just try to talk about your feelings and, and it sounds like it's causing you a lot of the pain. 

00:34:00
CAMMIE Yeah, he, um, you know, he hurt me so, that just, you know, it's hard to, um... Do, do, do you guys have tissue in here or anything? 

00:34:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah hold on. Take your time. 

00:34:25
CAMMIE Um, I just, you know, I don't think of myself as, um, a weak person. 

00:34:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:34:35
CAMMIE You know, like I'm here and I came, I came to school and I, I do my work and, um, I take, um, I, I was taking this Taekwondo class, um, for a little while and I just thought it would kind of, I thought it would kind of help me make me feel safe in, in school. 

00:35:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:35:00
CAMMIE But, um, you know this, I didn't, you know, I just didn't, I didn't know. Um, I didn't know that would, um, could happen really. I just, I'm sorry, I just, I don't know what to, I don't, I, there's nothing to say. 

00:35:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Don't apologize and take your time. 

00:35:25
CAMMIE I just can't really, you know, like study now. 

00:35:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:35:35
CAMMIE I don't, I don't want to go out. Um, I don't want to see him, you know. 

00:35:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:35:40
CAMMIE I don't want to see his stupid friends. I don't want to see, or go to this stupid parties, those stupid people. I don't wanna, like, be here, you know, like at school anymore. This is, like, this is stupid. Like it's all really stupid. They tell you that, you know, you can go and, and do whatever you want to do and, and I just didn't think this would happen to me. 

00:36:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm. It's not your fault. It's, it sounds like it was something horrible that happened and I just want... 

00:36:25
CAMMIE (crosstalk) I shouldn't have been there. Of course it was my fault. 

00:36:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL It's not your fault. 

00:36:25
CAMMIE I shouldn't have been there. I shouldn't have let him talk to me like that. I shouldn't haven't even been at that party. I, I was supposed that have a study group that night. I shouldn't have even been there, and I shouldn't have worn this stupid dress. There was the stupidest dress that my roommate told me that I had to wear 'cuz she thought it, it was like red. I'm so stupid. 

00:36:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL No, you're not. He was the one that forced himself on you. 

00:36:55
CAMMIE But I was the one who was, like, there, and I guess, I was, like, drinking. I don't even, I don't even know. I didn't even have that much. I don't even like drinking really. 

00:37:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. It doesn't matter. He was the one that violatedyou. 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL What are you thinking about right now? 

00:37:15
CAMMIE I don't know what to do. 

00:37:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:37:25
CAMMIE I don't what to do. I don't want to study, I don't wanna go outside. I don't wanna, stupid. I don't wanna be here. I don't wanna go to parties. I don't wanna talk to my friends. I can't talk to my family about this. 

00:37:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm hmm. 

00:37:40
CAMMIE I shouldn't even stay in school. There's just no point. 

00:37:50
[sil.] 

00:37:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL It, it sounds like you're really hurting right now. And at the same time, like, I think you're being really brave for coming here and talking about it with me. 

00:38:05
CAMMIE I don't feel brave. 

00:38:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL What do you feel? 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:20
CAMMIE I feel like, like I was, I was just used, you know? Like all he sees is a, all, all anybody sees is a woman, a young woman and it's just, do whatever they want. They don't care. 

00:38:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Hmm. 

00:38:50
[sil.] 

00:38:50
CAMMIE It's like I have no value and, and what's gonna happen to him? Nothing. Nothing is gonna happen to him at all. Nothing. He has just such a good reputation at school. Everyone knows who he is. Nobody would believe me. 

00:39:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm. 

00:39:10
CAMMIE Nothing is gonna happen to him at all. It's the same as it's been for like, centuries. 

00:39:15
CAMMIE They'd think I was lying. Do you believe that? They would think I was lying. 

00:39:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL What happened when you talked to the police? 

00:39:35
CAMMIE I kinda wish there'd been a, a woman policeman. I don't, I don't know, a woman police officer. 

00:39:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
CAMMIE I, I like, I don't know. My, my friend was really great. My, my friend kind of, she didn't like tell them for me. She kind of like stayed with me and, and made, she told them that, um, she was my sister even though she's not, um, so that she could stay with me. 

00:40:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:40:05
CAMMIE And, um, I told the police kind of, you know, who he was and what he did, and they like wrote it all down, um, and asked me a lot of questions and that's when I got so embarrassed because I, they knew I had, I had drank alcohol. But, you know, I, I thought that would take the credit from my story, you know. 

00:40:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:40:35
CAMMIE And I didn't want to tell them that I had drank anything 'cuz then it, again like, it makes it my fault, you know. 

00:40:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm. But it's not your fault. 

00:40:45
CAMMIE I don't know if that's what they thought. But they, they wrote it all down and I don't know. I don't know what's supposed to happen now. I mean I don't anything about his, like, connections or whatever. So I don't know if this means that he can be stopped. It's not like I'm gonna write a letter or to the paper or something. 

00:41:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:41:15
CAMMIE So, I don't know what can they do? What can the police do? 

00:41:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, they hopefully are having an open investigation and questioning people and trying to find out more about what happened that night. 

00:41:30
CAMMIE They're not gonna tell them who I am are they? 

00:41:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um, no, they'll probably just ask a lot of questions, just to, to find out. You concerned about that? Yeah. 

00:41:45
CAMMIE Yeah. 

00:41:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL What worries you about that? 

00:41:50
CAMMIE I don't want him to know that. I don't want any of his stupid friends to know. 

00:42:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:42:00
CAMMIE He probably told all of them already. I don't want, I don't know want people to know about this. 

00:42:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:42:10
CAMMIE I don't, I don't know if he even knows that I went to the police. I don't know maybe I shouldn't have done it. 

00:42:25
[sil.] 

00:42:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL I mean, I think you're just trying to get justice for what happened to you. 

00:42:30
CAMMIE I guess so. I mean it, I guess so. I just I don't, I don't want any anybody to know about this. I don't want anybody to talk to me about it. I don't want my family to find out. I don't my teachers to know. I don't wanna be like considered that girl who was raped, you know. 

00:42:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:43:00
[sil.] 

00:43:00
CAMMIE It's not fair, that's why. 

00:43:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL It's not fair. 

00:43:10
CAMMIE No. 

00:43:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL It wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything. 

00:43:20
[sil.] 

00:43:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL And again I just have to say again that it's, I think you're so brave for coming. Not only here but going to the police. 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:40
CAMMIE I just don't know, I don't know what I'm gonna do next. 

00:43:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Maybe that's something that we can talk about, because it sounds like you're, you're unsure about what you want to do next. We could talk about what would it be like if you went along with the or continue to press charges, and it also sounds like that there's some fear that people are gonna find out, and you're gonna be labeled as something. 

00:44:10
CAMMIE It sounds so terrible. It sounds so tiring. 

00:44:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:44:15
CAMMIE I just want this to go away. I, I want it to go away. I just wanna to disappear. I want him to, I don't want him to be at school. 

00:44:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:44:25
CAMMIE And I want this to just go away. I don't want anybody to know about it 'cuz then it won't go away. 

00:44:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:44:40
CAMMIE I just, I wish, I wish I knew how to just make this feeling, I, I feel like I can feel it still on me. 

00:44:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:44:50
CAMMIE It's like, I'm just like, it's like I'm dirty, you know. I don't want other people to think I'm dirty. 

00:45:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:45:00
CAMMIE It's like it's on, it's like, it's disgusting. You know, he's disgusting. 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL It really is unfair and I can just feel how much pain you're going through. And I think that again you coming here and talking about it not only was it brave but it also can be something that can be helpful. You know, bottling things up, you know, maybe that's where it makes it hard for you to concentrate and, uh, you know, difficult for you to, to get out of bed 'cuz you're holding so much and you're not really talking about it or expressing it. 

00:45:55
CAMMIE What do I do? Should I like leave school? 

00:46:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL I don't think we need to make any decisions. 

00:46:00
CAMMIE I mean, maybe I should. Maybe I should just leave and maybe I should just, you know, take some time away. I don't have to tell my parents. I could just, you know, get a job somewhere, somewhere else for a little while, and just, like, not have to go, just not have to go back here. 

00:46:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm hmm. 

00:46:20
CAMMIE Just take some time away, be like, you know, not around all of this. Maybe that, maybe that's what I need to do. I just need to go. I should just leave. It sounds like a good idea. 

00:46:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL So that's one option. Are there are other options? 

00:46:35
CAMMIE No. I mean, I couldn't stay here. Not with all this mess and everything. I mean, I should, I could. I can't keep this from my family. I can't go back to, I can't go back home. I mean, maybe I could move in with like, I have an aunt that lives in another town. I could move in with her. 

00:47:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:47:05
CAMMIE I don't really want to. So yeah. I guess I could take time off of school. I'd have to like, ask for a leave of absence. I'd have to find a job, new friends. 

00:47:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, like I said I, I don't know if need to make any major decisions right now but I know that this can be a place hopefully, that is, uh, a safe place where you can kind of talk about what your options are, and, you know, try to figure out what would be the best thing for you to do. 

00:47:50
CAMMIE What do you think I should do? 

00:47:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL You know, I can't tell you what to do, I can help you, uh, decide on your on what to do. I mean I could, we could talk about the different options. I mean you could leave and, um, not deal with it. You could continue with the investigation. I mean it's really your decision. 

00:48:15
CAMMIE So you don't think I should, I should leave. 

00:48:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um, well, I just want to, you to do what's best for you. 

00:48:30
CAMMIE I don't know. I don't know what I should do. 

00:48:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, again it's up to you to decide what to do, but at the same time, I also know that if you got justice and, and he was convicted of this awful thing that he did for you, that that might be one way of at least starting to get some peace from this. 

00:48:55
CAMMIE Do you think he could get convicted? 

00:49:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. But the only way that that could happen is if you continue to be strong and continue with the case. 

00:49:10
CAMMIE I don't know how I would, like, talk about this to any, to, to those cops again. 

00:49:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:49:20
CAMMIE Those guys, I don't... 

00:49:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL You can request a female police officer. 

00:49:25
CAMMIE I felt like they thought that I was just this dirty girl, you know, who like goes to parties, and then drinks, and then messes with these, you know, like sports players or whatever. 

00:49:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:49:45
CAMMIE They're just gonna judge me you know. 

00:49:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:49:50
CAMMIE And I can't, I can't, I can't take more of that. 

00:49:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:49:55
CAMMIE It's hard enough already at school, you know, being a woman of color at school like, just trying to get my degree so I can just like, have a job finally. 

00:50:10
DR, KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:50:10
CAMMIE Save some money. And all these student loans, like, I can't, I can't afford to be turned into this like, you know ,leech or something just trying to bring this guy down or something like that. 

00:50:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:50:25
CAMMIE I don't want them to look at me like that. 

00:50:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. I mean, it's so unfair because this one event you didn't need changes your life. You really had a lot of stuff going on for you. 

00:50:45
[sil.] 

00:50:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Again coming here shows that you have a voice. You wanna do what's best for you. 

00:50:55
CAMMIE I guess I do. I wanna fucking, I wanna kick him. 

00:51:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:51:00
CAMMIE I wanna punch him in the face I could tell you that. I learned that in my class. 

00:51:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:51:10
CAMMIE I can't. 

00:51:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, Cammie, we're almost out of time today, um, and I just wanted to check in with you. Uh, what was this is like talking with me? 

00:51:25
CAMMIE It feels weird to talk about it. 

00:51:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:51:35
CAMMIE It feels weird but, um, I, I like that it makes it a little more real to talk about it because, I mean, the last couple of days I've kind of, well I've, I've pretended, I've, the last couple of days I kind of have just trying to do everything I can to not think about it at all. 

00:52:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:52:05
CAMMIE I've been, um, you know, I go to the gym anyway, I've been going to the gym, um, a lot, um. 

00:52:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:52:10
CAMMIE I, um, I went to the movies, um, like, four, three times, four times. Um, I've just been, I've just been doing a lot of things that I don't always do, um, that, so, I don't want be out during the day too much, like I said. I don't want to run into him but, um, I've just been trying to do a lot to, uh, like I've been trying to do my homework. I've just been trying to stay really busy, and I guess being here and talking about it reminded me, you know. 

00:52:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:52:45
CAMMIE It happened, and, um, I mean I, I guess it's, I don't know if I'm gonna, if I want to talk about it a lot. 

00:53:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm. Well tell, tell you what. Let's, um, let's make a deal that I'll be here for you whenever you want to talk about it. I think it would be great if we could meet on a regular basis. Um, we could talk about what you decide, whether it is to continue with, uh, the charges. Um, we could, I could help you along the way in terms of, you know, being there for you when you go back to the police, um, help you in understanding like, you know, what, what you would want, like for example, uh, having a female police officer, um, be a part of, uh, the investigation. So figuring out what you want, what's best for you and, and once a week we come in here and we could talk about, you know, whatever it is that you decide, um, and, and hopefully, um, this could be a, again a safe space for you to just kind of explore all these things. 

00:54:00
CAMMIE Are you gonna tell anybody about it? 

00:54:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Everything you say here is completely confidential Um, doesn't leave the room. Um, the only reason I would ever break confidentiality is if I thought you were to hurt yourself or others and I don't think that's the case here. Um, but everything you say is, is safe, um, with me. And I hope that I'm conveying to you that I am not judging you. I don't think it was your fault at all. You really are just the victim here. You did nothing wrong. 

00:54:35
CAMMIE Okay. 

00:54:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL So, why don't we end here. Um, I'm gonna give you my card so you can call me. Um, maybe we could set up at least once a week but maybe if you want we could do twice a week, at least at the, initially, um, and again you don't have to decide anything big right now but, I'll be here whenever you decide what you wanna do to do. Thanks again. 

00:55:05
CAMMIE (crosstalk)All right. All right, thank you.

In this session, Dr. Nadal used humanistic approaches in working with his client, Kammie. Because victims often blame may have a difficult time discussing their traumatic experiences, it is important to remain patient and allow them to share at the pace that is comfortable for them. Because victims often blame themselves, it is also important to remind victims that they are not at fault and to directly dispel any false cognition they may have... 

00:55:15
...Notice how Dr. Nadal is able to remain empathetic with Kammie, while also cognizant of the legal issues at hand. Forensic mental health counselors who work with victims must always be aware of the legal issues their clients may face. While they don't provide any legal advice, they can provide a safe space for clients to discuss their feelings and help their clients in making optimal decisions for themselves.
