TAVISTOCK PUBLICATIONS in association with University of Manchester Department of Psychiatry HANDLING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS Peter Maguire 

00:00:00
PETER MAGUIRE  Patients who realize they have cancer have to cope with the possibility that the cancer could recur and cause their death. They also have to contend with treatments which may have very unpleasant side effects, like vomiting. Or have treatments which involve the loss of a crucial body part or function. Not surprisingly then, a substantial proportion of cancer patients may develop quite serious psychological problems like depression, anxiety, and sexual difficulties. Unfortunately, few of the patients who are affected in this way are likely to disclose this to the doctors and nurses involved in their care. Nor do many doctors and nurses usually assess how these patients are adapting psychologically. Consequently, many of these problems go unrecognized and untreated. Now we found that doctors and nurses are reluctant to probe in this way for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that they're frightened that if they do probe, they'll be asked difficult questions. For example, have I got cancer? They're unsure how best to deal with this kind of question. And they're afraid that if they do try and answer it, they'll cause more harm than good. If they join your staff, they're also worried that they may get into trouble with their consultant or award system. So we've made a videotape to show you a way in which it is possible to both help the patient by answering their question with a way which also avoid the doctor or nurse getting into difficulty. So, what I want to show you is how I try to advise one of our specialist nurses who came to ask me for help with this particular problem. Now, as you watch the tape, from time to time, there'll be a caption entitled 'discussion point.' This is to give you the chance to think about what you've just seen, or discuss it. Let's begin on the morning when the nurse came to see me to ask my advice about how to handle difficult questions. 

00:02:25
PETER MAGUIRE  Well, Susi, what can I do for you? 

00:02:30
SUSI WILKINSON Well, yesterday I went to see a patient at home who was due to come in to hospital for a colostomy for cancer of the rectum. 

00:02:35
PETER MAGUIRE Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
SUSI WILKINSON Now, when I went to see her, I knew that she had not been told exactly what was wrong with her. But when she asked me what was wrong with her, I just didn't know what to say. I fought her off completely. I told her to ask the surgeon when she next saw him. And I could tell from her face that she felt totally let down. How should I have handled the situation like that? 

00:02:55
PETER MAGUIRE  Well, I think the first thing to realize is that many doctors and nurses are unsure how best to handle such awkward questions. And they do tend then to fob the patient off. Now, if I'm going to help you, I'm going to need to see exactly how you handle such questions in practice. 

00:03:10
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. How will you do that? 

00:03:15
PETER MAGUIRE Well, I need to train someone to simulate a patient like the lady you've just talked about. 

00:03:20
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
PETER MAGUIRE Then I'll ask you to talk to her in our television studio... 

00:03:20
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
PETER MAGUIRE ...and we'll record your interview on television. 

00:03:25
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
PETER MAGUIRE Ah, then replay your interview with you... 

00:03:30
SUSI WILKINSON Okay. 

00:03:30
PETER MAGUIRE ...okay? We'll watch it. And I'll discuss it at various points to indicate ways in which it is possible to handle such awkward questions. 

00:03:35
SUSI WILKINSON All right, let's try that. 

00:03:35
PETER MAGUIRE  Good. 

00:03:40
SUSI WILKINSON Well, here I go. I'm feeling very nervous. I'm sure I'm going to make a complete mess of this. 

00:03:45
PETER MAGUIRE Well, I can understand you feeling very apprehensive. But let me explain exactly what I'd like you to do. 

00:03:50
Mrs. Whittington, age 40: 

00:03:50
PETER MAGUIRE Mrs. Whittington is a 40-year-old woman. She was seen 10 days ago by Mr. Howard because she has had rectal bleeding and constipation. He did a Sigmoidoscopy... 

00:04:00
Sigmoidoscopy - rectal cancer. 

00:04:00
PETER MAGUIRE ... and discovered that she had a small cancer of her rectum so he biopsied it. 

00:04:05
Biopsy confirmed this. 

00:04:05
PETER MAGUIRE  This confirmed his diagnosis and so he saw her a few days later to explain what he had found. 

00:04:15
SUSI WILKINSON How much did he tell her? 

00:04:15
PETER MAGUIRE  Well, she was very flustered when he saw her at the clinic so he thought it best not to tell her directly that she had cancer. Instead, he gave her the following explanation. 

00:04:25
"The biopsy showed that your rectum is badly inflamed." 

00:04:25
DR. HOWARD The biopsy we took had shown your rectum is badly inflamed. It could turn nasty and become malignant. So we should remove it completely to prevent this happening. This means that you will be unable to empty your bowels normally. We'll have to bring a loop of bowel on to your tummy. Your motions will then empty through an opening into a bag. I'll ask my nurse to come and see you to explain it all. 

00:04:55
PETER MAGUIRE But then afterward she had any questions but she was so flustered, she just couldn't collect her thoughts and consequently she didn't ask him anything. You're now the nurse, you'd have to go around and see her at home(ph)... 

00:05:05
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
PETER MAGUIRE ...to see if she wants any more information prior to being admitted for surgery. 

00:05:10
SUSI WILKINSON How long do I have? 

00:05:10
PETER MAGUIRE Well, up to half an hour if you need it. But you may well not need as much time as that. Okay? 

00:05:15
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
PETER MAGUIRE Now, I'm going to be sitting in there with you to see how it goes. And I may, of course, ask you to stop from time to time just to comment on how it's going which will advise you on what you should do next. Okay? Now, Mrs. Whittington knows what's going to happen. And she's quite happy about what we've proposed and about helping with this interview. Okay? 

00:05:35
SUSI WILKINSON All right, I'll have a go. 

00:05:35
PETER MAGUIRE  Fine. Shall we go in? 

00:05:40
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:05:40
PETER MAGUIRE  This is Mrs. Whittington. 

00:05:45
SUSI WILKINSON Hello Mrs. Whittington. 

00:05:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Hello. 

00:05:45
SUSI WILKINSON  I'm Susi Wilkinson; the station(ph) nurse working for Mr. Howard. Did he tell you that I'd be coming to see you? 

00:05:55
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes, yes he did. 

00:05:55
SUSI WILKINSON Well, what I'd like you to do is make certain that you have all the information you need before you go in to hospital for your operation. Will that be all right? 

00:06:05
MRS. WHITTINGTON Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
SUSI WILKINSON We have about a half an hour together and it would help me if I could take some notes since I'd like to try and keep in touch with you after the operation. 

00:06:10
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Hmm. Yes. 

00:06:15
SUSI WILKINSON All right? 

00:06:15
MRS. WHITTINGTON Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
PETER MAGUIRE That was a good start Susi. How did you feel Mrs. Whittington? 

00:06:20
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, I'm very relieved to see the nurse. Uhm, when I was at the clinic, I was very very agitated and worried and I really didn't ask the sort of questions as, uhm, I wanted to... 

00:06:30
PETER MAGUIRE Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
MRS. WHITTINGTON ...or reflection and I have been very upset about this since. 

00:06:30
PETER MAGUIRE Uh hmm. What about you Susi, how did you feel? 

00:06:35
SUSI WILKINSON I think it's going all right so far. 

00:06:35
PETER MAGUIRE Well, it is indeed. What I'm pleased about is that you remembered to introduce yourself and explain exactly what you wanted to do and how you plan to proceed. And I'm pretty sure Mrs. Whittington is clear about the purpose of your visit. So let's carry on now and see how it goes. 

00:06:50
SUSI WILKINSON  Mrs. Whittington, can you tell me what Mr. Howard said when he saw you last week? 

00:07:00
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes. Well, he told me I have some kind of inflammation in my rectum that needed to be taken away or else it might go a bit funny or something. But I didn't really understand what he was talking about. But I don't think I can face that operation at all. 

00:07:15
SUSI WILKINSON Well the problem is this; when Mr. Howard saw you in the hospital, he asked you to come in to hospital for the operation because for your own good. 

00:07:20
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes. But I don't understand what this all due to. 

00:07:25
SUSI WILKINSON Well, Mr. Howard is obviously very concerned about you and that's why he wants you in for the operation. 

00:07:30
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes, but I don't understand what's happening to me. 

00:07:30
SUSI WILKINSON You are obviously getting very anxious about this, perhaps 'coz you're not feeling well. 

00:07:35
MRS. WHITTINGTON No, no, it's not that at all! I just don't understand what it was going on at all. 

00:07:40
SUSI WILKINSON You seem to be very upset, shall I ask a social worker to come and see you? (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Oh, I don't want a social worker. A social worker would only talk, that wouldn't do any good at all. 

00:07:45
PETER MAGUIRE  Well, let's stop it there. 

00:07:50
SUSI WILKINSON Yes, I think I've got myself into a rather a muddle, haven't I? 

00:07:50
PETER MAGUIRE  Yeah, but I think you'll find that when we go through it in detail, otherwise we can help you try and tackle the situation more effectively. Okay? So let's replay it and see just how it went. All right? 

00:08:05
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. Right. 

00:08:05
SUSI WILKINSON  Mrs. Whittington, what did Mr. Howard say when you saw him last week? 

00:08:15
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, he told me I have some kind of in, inflammation in my rectum that needed to be taken away or else it might go a bit funny or something. But I didn't really understand what he was talking about. But I don't think I can face that operation at all. 

00:08:30
SUSI WILKINSON Well the problem is this, when Mr. Howard saw you in the hospital, he asked you to come into hospital for the operation because for your own good. 

00:08:35
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Yes. But I don't understand what this is all due to. 

00:08:40
SUSI WILKINSON Well, Mr. Howard is obviously very concerned about you and that's why he wants you in for the operation. 

00:08:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes, but I don't understand what's happening to me. 

00:08:45
SUSI WILKINSON You are obviously getting very anxious about this, perhaps 'coz you're not feeling well. 

00:08:50
MRS. WHITTINGTON No, no, it's not that at all! I just don't understand what it was going on at all. 

00:08:55
SUSI WILKINSON You seem to be very upset, shall I ask the social worker to come and see you? (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
MRS. WHITTINGTON Oh, I don't want a so. 

00:09:00
PETER MAGUIRE  Well, did you notice that at the beginning, you began, 'coz I think a lot of doctors and nurses went by asking what she have been told at the clinic. 

00:09:10
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:09:10
PETER MAGUIRE Now, like all other patients, she hadn't really come away for the clinic with a clear grasp so that didn't really help you because what you then face whether she still had some awkward questions to ask. (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:09:20
PETER MAGUIRE And really, what I noticed is that you really are trying to avoid asking her, answering her questions directly. 

00:09:30
SUSI WILKINSON Yes, I did, I avoided the question. And all I did was just back up the surgeon. 

00:09:35
PETER MAGUIRE Yeah. Now, the other thing that seems(ph) to me was the way she made it pretty clear there was something about the operation, you know, she couldn't face and you didn't seem to want to go into that either. 

00:09:45
SUSI WILKINSON No, I didn't. I really got myself into rather a jam, haven't I? 

00:09:50
PETER MAGUIRE Yeah, but, and I'm sure we can still help you with treating the situation. 

00:09:50
SUSI WILKINSON But how can I? Because I've already said that I've felt she was anxious. (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
PETER MAGUIRE Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
SUSI WILKINSON  And passed the buck(ph) to the social worker. 

00:10:00
PETER MAGUIRE Well, there are still ways we can sort that out and we, we'll go into that in some detail but before we do, I just like to pause and, and just ask you to consider why and as like yourself, is obviously concerned about your patients... (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
SUSI WILKINSON Hmm. 

00:10:10
PETER MAGUIRE ... should have used such avoidance tactics. 

00:10:15
Discussion point 

00:10:15
SUSI WILKINSON  Well, I didn't want to be the one to tell her that she had cancer. It could upset her and also it could get me into trouble with the surgeons. 

00:10:25
PETER MAGUIRE  Yes, those kinds or worries I think are shared by a lot of doctors and nurses in this situation 

00:10:30
SUSI WILKINSON  Hmm. 

00:10:35
PETER MAGUIRE Okay, but I'm being seem to find out just how Mrs. Whittington is feeling about it. 

00:10:35
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:10:35
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes well, I am feeling extremely frustrated. 

00:10:40
PETER MAGUIRE Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
MRS. WHITTINGTON Because she's not answering any of my questions. 

00:10:40
PETER MAGUIRE No, she isn't. And she's explained some of the reasons for that and obviously what we've got to do is to help Susi find some way of dealing with your questions... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
MRS. WHITTINGTON Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
PETER MAGUIRE ...in a way that helps you but doesn't get her into trouble. 

00:10:50
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Yes. 

00:10:55
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:10:55
PETER MAGUIRE Okay. 

00:10:55
SUSI WILKINSON Yes, that'll be very helpful. 

00:10:55
PETER MAGUIRE So, what you and I need to do now is to pause... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
PETER MAGUIRE ...on that side and discuss in detail... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
PETER MAGUIRE ...how you might handle these questions. And then you'd come back and try it out, and we'll see how it goes. 

00:11:05
SUSI WILKINSON Fine. 

00:11:05
PETER MAGUIRE Okay? 

00:11:05
MRS. WHITTINGTON All right. 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:10
PETER MAGUIRE  Well, let's assume that you've completed the introduction, okay? 

00:11:20
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:11:20
PETER MAGUIRE And let's just discuss how you're going to manage the point when she asked you is it cancer, okay? 

00:11:25
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:11:25
PETER MAGUIRE Now, the first thing to do is to reflect her question back. 

00:11:30
SUSI WILKINSON How do I do that? 

00:11:30
PETER MAGUIRE well, you should say something like, I'd be happy to answer your question but first it would help me if I understood why you're worried it might be cancer. Okay? 

00:11:40
SUSI WILKINSON Fine. 

00:11:40
PETER MAGUIRE Now, that'll lead her to tell you what her own current understanding of the situation is, okay? 

00:11:45
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:11:45
PETER MAGUIRE And it will be come clear with the way she answers that whether she really is aware that she's got cancer... (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
PETER MAGUIRE ...or whether she prefers to deny the possibility. Okay? 

00:11:55
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
PETER MAGUIRE Now, if her replies will be which she's realistically aware it is cancer... (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
SUSI WILKINSON  Uh hmm. 

00:12:00
PETER MAGUIRE ...and then answer as if... (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:12:00
PETER MAGUIRE ...that she has it. I don't think you have any option but to confirm that her understanding is right. Okay? 

00:12:05
SUSI WILKINSON I can confirm that? 

00:12:05
PETER MAGUIRE Well, I think you can't do because otherwise you're lying. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
PETER MAGUIRE And yet her understanding is correct. 

00:12:10
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:12:10
PETER MAGUIRE And there's no way she's having a good relationship with you once she found out the truth. (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
PETER MAGUIRE There's now way she could have any trust in you, is there? 

00:12:15
SUSI WILKINSON  No. 

00:12:20
PETER MAGUIRE On the other hand, if her replies indicate that she's not aware she's got cancer then, I mean, she's really told you the answers you want since she's not ready to get into a dialogue about having cancer, yet. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
SUSI WILKINSON Uh, (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
PETER MAGUIRE Okay? 

00:12:30
SUSI WILKINSON ...Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
PETER MAGUIRE Although the option may arise in the future. 

00:12:30
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm, all right. 

00:12:30
PETER MAGUIRE  Okay? 

00:12:35
SUSI WILKINSON I'll have a go. 

00:12:35
PETER MAGUIRE So let's see how it goes. 

00:12:35
SUSI WILKINSON Fine. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:40
SUSI WILKINSON  Well, Mrs. Whittington, can I begin by asking you, what you understand about what is going to happen to you when you go into for, to hospital for your operation? 

00:12:55
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, as far I know, I've got this inflammation in my rectum and I've got to have it taken out. But what I don't understand is why have I got to have such a very serious operation, if it's only inflammation? 

00:13:10
SUSI WILKINSON Well, I'd be happy to answer your question but it would help me to begin with if you could tell me exactly what you've been thinking about it. 

00:13:15
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Yes, well, I have this friend down the road who had exactly the same symptoms that I've got. She'd been passing blood and she'd been losing a lot of weight. And they took her into hospital and they told her just what they've told me that she had this inflammation that would be better if it was cut out. And, uhm, she ended up by having a colostomy which is what I'm going to have. (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
MRS. WHITTINGTON Now, when she came out of hospital, she seemed fine and they told her that she was all clear. But with a few, within a few months of coming out of hospital, she died of cancer. And I'm absolutely terrified that the same thing's happening to me. 

00:13:55
SUSI WILKINSON You say that you're terrified about this. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:14:00
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, I just can't help thinking that if it was only inflammation, ah, I don't know I, it, it must be more serious than just inflammation and I'm sure it must be cancer and that accounts for why I have been losing so much weight. 

00:14:15
SUSI WILKINSON Well, I can understand you feel terrified that you might have cancer particularly as you've been losing weight. Is there any other reason why you suspect it could be cancer? 

00:14:25
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, as I said before, it's mainly this friend down the road really, you know. And, ah, I'm just beginning to feel so terribly, terribly tired and drained now and it's just not like me at all and I used to have this feeling that it is cancer, can you tell me is it cancer? 

00:14:45
SUSI WILKINSON Well, I'm afraid, yes, it is. That's why they want to remove it completely. 

00:14:50
MRS. WHITTINGTON Oh, dear. I knew it was. I knew I wasn't being stupid to think that it was much more serious than just inflammation. Is there anything they can do about it? 

00:15:00
SUSI WILKINSON Well, that's the good news. It looks as if we've caught your cancer at a very early stage. Mr. Howard is confident that he's going to be able to remove it completely then you'll be disease free. Obviously, we won't know for certain 'til after the operation. And the problem for you now is the uncertainty of it all, isn't it? 

00:15:20
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Yes, it is. I'm going to be worrying myself silly about what they're going to find in the operation. But you do think that they might be able to control it, do you? 

00:15:30
SUSI WILKINSON We hope so, yes. 

00:15:35
PETER MAGUIRE Can we stop it there please? I'm very pleased you began by reflecting her question back. That allowed you to clarify just what her own understanding was. It was then particularly important that you were prepared to confirm that her understanding was right. That she did have cancer. To lie in that situation would've been no help to her at all. But of course, having confirmed her understanding, you are inevitably faced with the prospect that she might become upset. But you notice in doing it this way you have avoided this very difficult trap of being the one who decides to tell or not tell. Now it's also important you prepared then to grasp just how she was feeling and clarify how she'd reacted to the fact you've confirmed that her fears were right. I was also pleased that you then balanced the bad news with the good that something could be done about it. And although she was obviously not happy that her fears were being confirmed, at least she's begin, beginning to get a sense that something can be done about it. Now, what I want you to do is to proceed by asking her if she has any more questions. 

00:16:40
SUSI WILKINSON  Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me? 

00:16:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, yes, there are, really, can you tell me something about this loop of bowel thing? Uhm, I don't know whether I can face that operation. 

00:16:50
SUSI WILKINSON  Why? 

00:16:55
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, I just think that it's going to look awful and then it might smell a lot. 

00:16:55
SUSI WILKINSON Oh no, that shouldn't happen. We have very good appliances these days. There shouldn't be any problems at all. Let me show you a diagram perhaps, that'll help. 

00:17:05
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, I'm still a bit unhappy about it. 

00:17:05
PETER MAGUIRE Can we stop it there? And let's discuss how you've just handled the questions about whether the stoma would look awful and whether it would smell. 

00:17:15
Discussion point 

00:17:15
PETER MAGUIRE  So, let's watch that bit again. 

00:17:25
SUSI WILKINSON  Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me? 

00:17:30
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, yes, there are, really, can you tell me something about this loop of bowel thing? Uhm, I don't know whether I can face that operation. 

00:17:35
SUSI WILKINSON Why? 

00:17:35
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Well, I just think that it's going to look awful and then it might smell a lot. 

00:17:40
SUSI WILKINSON Oh no, that shouldn't happen. We have very good appliances these days. There shouldn't be any problems at all. Let me show you a diagram perhaps, that'll help. 

00:17:50
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, I'm still a bit unhappy about it. 

00:17:50
PETER MAGUIRE  So you're still feeling unhappy about it? 

00:17:55
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, yes, I'm afraid I am. Uhm, I'm just not convinced at all by... (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
PETER MAGUIRE Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
MRS. WHITTINGTON ...what she's telling me, ah, I think that it is going to smell and that it is going to look awful. 

00:18:05
PETER MAGUIRE Why are you so worried about it? 

00:18:05
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, this friend of mine, uhm, she never got used to her colostomy right even to the end that it was upsetting her. She was so sure that it was smelling and everything that she was really frightened of going out. 

00:18:15
PETER MAGUIRE That must be an awful thought. 

00:18:15
SUSI WILKINSON  How should I handle that situation? 

00:18:20
PETER MAGUIRE Well, the first thing to realize is, is you should try to avoid giving her false reassurance. (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:25
PETER MAGUIRE Okay. That is telling her that everything will be all right when in fact there could be complications. For example, it is quite likely that despite all your advice, she could have difficulty accepting the stoma. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
PETER MAGUIRE It's also possible despite the improvement of in appliances these days that the bag could leak and smell. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
PETER MAGUIRE And so her fears would be justified. 

00:18:45
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:18:45
PETER MAGUIRE And if problems like that did develop, she's not going to think too much of your advice and the danger is even more that she might not turn to you for help... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
PETER MAGUIRE ... when these problems develop. 

00:18:55
SUSI WILKINSON Yes. 

00:18:55
PETER MAGUIRE Now, the other point I'd like to make is that your reassurance was somewhat premature. 

00:19:00
SUSI WILKINSON Why was it? 

00:19:00
PETER MAGUIRE Well, I'm sure if you think about it, if you'd known that her fears were justified because of her experience of her friend, (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
PETER MAGUIRE ... who had a bad time with her colostomy then I don't think you would've tried to minimize her fears, would you? 

00:19:10
SUSI WILKINSON No. No. 

00:19:15
PETER MAGUIRE Okay. So as we try it again, try and avoid those two pitfalls. 

00:19:20
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
PETER MAGUIRE And begin by trying to clarify why she's so concerned that the stoma looked awful and why it should smell, okay? 

00:19:25
SUSI WILKINSON Okay. 

00:19:25
PETER MAGUIRE And once you've done that, you should be in a position to say to her quite honestly that even if those problems do arise and they could... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
PETER MAGUIRE  you should be in a position to help her. 

00:19:35
SUSI WILKINSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
PETER MAGUIRE Okay. 

00:19:35
SUSI WILKINSON Hmm. 

00:19:35
PETER MAGUIRE So let's try it that way and see how it goes. 

00:19:35
SUSI WILKINSON  Uh hmm. Fine. 

00:19:40
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, won't it look terrible and won't it smell a lot? 

00:19:40
SUSI WILKINSON  Why do you ask that? 

00:19:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, my friend never got used to her colostomy. She said it looked absolutely dreadful and she was so frightened that it was smelling a lot that she was terrified of going out in case people realized that she'd had a colostomy. 

00:19:55
SUSI WILKINSON Yes, there could be problems but one of my jobs is to ensure that we prevent these problems if possible. (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
MRS. WHITTINGTON Hmm. 

00:20:00
SUSI WILKINSON I can do this in two ways, firstly, by making certain that you have the right bag for you and also by teaching you how to manage your colostomy. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
MRS. WHITTINGTON Hmm. 

00:20:10
SUSI WILKINSON If we still have found any problems, I hope that you'll contact me as soon as you can and then together, we should be able to try and find a solution, we usually can. Is that all right? 

00:20:20
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes. Yes. 

00:20:20
SUSI WILKINSON Would you like to see a diagram? 

00:20:20
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Yes, I would like to very much. 

00:20:25
SUSI WILKINSON And then I can see afterwards if you're still worried. 

00:20:25
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Yes, I think that would be a great help. 

00:20:30
SUSI WILKINSON Well, this is what we call a colostomy. And the surgeon has to take a loop of your bowel up to the front of your tummy... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
SUSI WILKINSON ...so that it opens out onto your abdomen instead of through the back passage. 

00:20:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
SUSI WILKINSON  This of course means that a normal matter that would be emptied through your bowel will now empty onto your tummy. 

00:20:55
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes. 

00:20:55
SUSI WILKINSON Now one of my jobs is to ensure that you have a bag to receive this matter. And if I can make sure that you have the right bag, there should be little chance of any leakage or smell. And if there is any problem, I think we should be able to get around it. 

00:21:10
MRS. WHITTINGTON Hmm. 

00:21:10
SUSI WILKINSON You still look rather worried. 

00:21:10
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Well, (sighs) yes, is this cancer really, is it always fatal? 

00:21:20
SUSI WILKINSON No, by no means, no. And the whole point of doing the operation is of course to remove the cancer. And it looks from your point of view, as if we've caught the cancer at in such fairly early stage and I think we can be relatively confident about the outcome. 

00:21:35
MRS. WHITTINGTON Yes. (sighs) But supposing it's a lot bigger than they thought or, or perhaps it's spread or something? 

00:21:40
SUSI WILKINSON  Well, we should still be able to control it. 

00:21:45
MRS. WHITTINGTON Do you think you can, how am I going to know that? Well, you know. 

00:21:50
SUSI WILKINSON Well, of course the problem with any kind of cancer is the uncertainty of the outcome. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Hmm. 

00:21:55
SUSI WILKINSON But the best evidence that you will have is to how you feeling yourself. And of course, I shall be continuing to come and see you and I will see how you are. (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
MRS. WHITTINGTON Hmm. Hmm. 

00:22:00
SUSI WILKINSON  And also I will be able to give you any advice or information that you may require. 

00:22:05
MRS. WHITTINGTON  Well, I'm ah, I'm very, very grateful that you came actually. You know, I can't say I'm happy about what you had to tell me but I'm, I'm very, very glad to think that there is somebody who I can talk to if I do have any problem. 

00:22:20
SUSI WILKINSON  Well, we've talked about one or two of the difficulties. Now, if there are any other difficulties that arise, I will be only too willing to try and help you over these problems. 

00:22:35
MRS. WHITTINGTON Well, thank you very, very much indeed. 

00:22:35
SUSI WILKINSON All right. 

00:22:35
PETER MAGUIRE  Well, I hope you found that interesting and helpful. Let's recap some of the main points we've made. When you're first asked a difficult question, 

00:22:50
Reflect the question back 

00:22:50
PETER MAGUIRE - begin by reflecting it back. For example, by saying, "What is it that makes you think you've got cancer?" You should then be in a position by listening to what the patient tells you to know whether they want you to confirm that their understanding is correct or wants some other response from you. 

00:23:05
If the patient seeks confirmation, give it 

00:23:05
PETER MAGUIRE If they do want you to confirm that their understanding is correct, you should do so. But you should be alert to any signs that they've become upset- 

00:23:15
Clarify the reasons for any upset 

00:23:15
PETER MAGUIRE -and you should clarify the reasons for these. You should then be in a position to- 

00:23:20
Maintain hope 

00:23:20
PETER MAGUIRE - give them some hope by saying something like, "Well, even if it is cancer, I'm sure that it can be eradicated or controlled. 

00:23:30
Tailor what you say to what the patient wants to know 

00:23:30
PETER MAGUIRE So it's a matter really of tailoring what you say to what it is they want to know. There'll be some instances where it's clear from the patient's response that they prefer not to know usually because they're coping by the use of denial. 

00:23:45
Don't challenge denial 

00:23:45
PETER MAGUIRE And it's important that you don't challenge this denial but accept that's the way the patient is managing. Now it's very important that when you face difficult questions- 

00:23:55
Don't avoid questions Don't lie 

00:23:55
PETER MAGUIRE - you don't avoid them or lie because there's now good evidence this makes it much more difficult for patients to cope in the longer term. Finally, I want you to remember that you should try to- 

00:24:10
Avoid premature reassurance 

00:24:10
PETER MAGUIRE - avoid saying anything in a way of reassurance until you've established what it is that the patient's upset about and why. 

00:24:15
Avoid false assurance 

00:24:15
PETER MAGUIRE And do be careful to avoid, in your eagerness to be helpful, saying things that are falsely optimistic. Now, I don't expect you necessarily to agree with all the points we've made. But what I do hope is that our tape will encourage you to try these things out for yourself.
