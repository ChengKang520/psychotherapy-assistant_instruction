JAY HALEY (1923-2007) was known as one of the founders of the field of family therapy, strategic therapy, and brief therapy. His early work was in collaboration with some of the foremost thinkers of our time such as, Gregory Belson and Milton H. Erickson, MD. He was a professor at Stanford University, Howard University, the University of Maryland, and at the California School of Professional Psychology. He published more than 20 boos and over a hundred papers. 

00:00:00
The Case that Made the Shift from an Individual to a Couple Problem 

00:00:00
1990's 

00:00:00
Jay Haley 

00:00:00
JAY HALEY I had a case of a young woman who educated me, a lot there she came to me with a shaking right hand, trembling involuntarily, or intermittently and, uh, it was interfering with her work. She couldn't hold a pencil it would drop. She went through some very expensive neurological tests to, uh, find out what was wrong. And they couldn't find anything wrong. So she went to the therapy with a friend of mine for some months and the problem got worse. So I was in advised at the time, uh, we will do some hypnotherapy. So he referred her to me to get her over the symptom while he dealt with the problems, which is the way we thought in those days. Uh, we didn't think that getting people over the symptom was enough. But at any rate, he passed her on to me and I hypnotize her, she's a very good subject. And, uh, I suggested her left hand begin to shake and it began to shake. And as it did, the right hand stopped shaking. It seemed to me, the indicator wasn't a neurological problem, and I was a very inexpensive way to find that out, uh. Which is why I think it's helpful to learn hypnosis for simple things like that, sometimes. But at any rate, I woke her up with her left hand shaking and she said, "Now my left hand is shaking." And I said, "Well isn't that better? You don't hold a pencil in that hand." And she said, "I don't want either hand to shake." So I put her back into trance and said some the right sorts of things about her hands will only shake when necessary or something and then I woke her up and talked with her and I ask her as I look at the symptoms, "What's going to happen if this gets worse?" And, uh, she said, "I'll lose my job." And I said, "What if you do lose your job?" And she said, "Well my husband will have to go to work." And that shifted me from thinking of this as an individual problem to a dyadic problem, which I was trying to do in those days and it's difficult to make that shift sometimes. So it turns out she married her husband when he was in the Navy and he came out and he couldn't make up his mind whether to go to school or go to work. Meanwhile, she was supporting him. So, uh, being interested in the wider social unit, I asked how her parents were dealing with this and she said her parents were opposed to the marriage. And in fact, her mother called her every day and said, "Are you coming home today?" And she would say to her mother, "Mother, I have my own place now, I'm married." And the mother would say, "That won't last." Then the next day mother would call again and say, "Are you coming home today?" So I thought that was relevant to the girl having the shaking hand. But it isn't information that just popped out. I had to search for it. And as I thought about what to do about this, I brought the husband, and I also realized the husband's situation, he was in a place where that, her parents didn't approve of him. And they didn't approve of him not working. But they wouldn't approve if he went to college and the wife had to support him in school. And if he got a job it wouldn't be a job that would be good enough for them because he didn't have the skills. So, he was oscillating, doing nothing, really. And, uh, he couldn't conceive of functioning accepted relation to her parents because they were pulling so far from the situation. But that's an example of disengaging, of the task of disengaging a young couple from in-laws and as you do that, the symptoms go away. Actually, in this case I did some remarkable therapy and she was transformed and her hands stopped shaking, her husband went to work, her parents began to support the marriage. Well, what happened, what I think was perhaps, independent of me. What she did was get pregnant. And as she got pregnant, her husband had to go to work and her parents, who wanted her home, didn't want her back with a baby. So they shifted in the end to support this marriage. And I happily took the credit for the success of the case.

Therapy is Getting Past One Stage of Problems on to the Next Stage 

00:04:55
JAY HALEY But I think it's an example of how people go into a stage and they get past it into the next stage and, uh, this happens often naturally, and sometimes with the help of a therapist, if you're thinking that way.

A Separating Couple 

00:05:10
[music] 

00:05:15
JAY HALEY A straightforward task to a couple, and, uh, it's one I put in that new edition of 'Problem Solving Therapy' because it's a nice interview I found. This is just the end of the interview. It was done by Richard Belson, my supervisor. And it's a couple who've come in after 27 years of marriage, and, uh, the wife is about to leave the husband, he says. And it's really kind of like an American Odyssey, uh, this husband and wife, over the years have had trouble and the husband always had the power. He held the money, particularly, and he would supervise her, as she would say, "He would supervise any cent I spent and say you spent too much for this and too much for that." So they had a boy who was a problem and it when it reached time for the boy to go to college, the, uh, wife said he must go to college. The husband, "I can't afford it." So the wife said, "I'll go to work to put him through college." And this was a difficult boy they struggled with over time. So often the difficult boy helps people out, really. And so, she, she went to work to help him pay the tuition and in the process she had some money of her own. And she got a little more independent. And didn't have to be supervised by the husband about money, so, and he was, the person who has power in the marriage is the one who can leave, who threatens to leave. Fine, if you don't do it, I'll leave. And the other one gives in. And this husband had done this for a long period, so at this point he said, "Well if you don't do it, I'll leave." And she said, "Well maybe that's a pretty good idea." At that point he got upset and they came in to therapy. That's when they came. And they had a lot of therapy previously. Of the kind where they would go to a therapist, the therapist would sympathize with the wife, get angry at the husband and the husband would drop out, because he was a difficult guy. So they came in and, uh, Belson had saw them and brought out all this information. And at the end we like to give a task of some kind so we had to think of one. And, uh, Belson came out and we talked it over. And there were two issues really, one was money and one was sex, that, uh, presumably, he wanted more of and she wanted less although I don't think that was really the case. That was their agreement. And, uh, certainly money was the biggest issue so you want a task around the biggest issue. And in this case it was money. You also want a task, if a couple is thinking of breaking up a 27 year marriage, you shouldn't give a little task, you should give them a big task. Because it's a big event, really. So we looked for something big. And then gives them, there's one reason I'm telling you, he gives it very well he wants them to do this and it's an unusual thing to do. And he sets up a framework that makes it reasonable. I won't stop and go all the way through, but he says things like, uh, that, uh, if you want to get over a problem you have to do something, you know. And, uh, he says things like, you may be familiar with how we work here, is we give people something to do. It seems a minor thing to say, except it means he isn't saying this, the place is saying, the institution is say it. This is how we worked it. I mean there's some stuff like that, I don't want to stop and go, but it's interesting. 

00:08:50
Therapist Richard Belson 

00:08:55
RICHARD BELSON I think that it's always possible that you still may separate and if that should happen, that it's good you separated with a little bit of better feelings so that, what you might do is, that just in case, uh, you should end up, that, uh, nothing can be changed around, and you should each one goes his or her own separate way, you might as well have some pleasant memories rather than some bitter memories of how it ended. So you might want to consider about, maybe, being just a little more pleasant with each other so you don't have to end with terrible bitterness after so many years of, uh, being together. But I'd like to make a, uh, specific suggestion. Uh, again I suppose you've heard that the way we work is, that instead of just talking, we like to make some suggestions for people to follow during the week. You were aware of that? If your going to get any change after all these years, clearly you know, just to say to you, uh, "Why don't you be nice to each other?" That's going to be a fruitless and a thankless kinda undertaking. So I'd like you to, to, make some changes that can make some changes, but that'd be alright. Alright. Now I'd like you both to be a little bit flexible. Would you be willing to be flexible and to show some flexibility and show some open mindedness? Would you? What I'd like you to do is, there has to be something that has to have some, uh, some, something that will, will be of help. Otherwise, for sure, you know, you're going to end up in the same position, not talking to each other and so forth. I would like you to do something that would be absolutely, a, uh, remarkable move towards your wife. And I would like you to do something remarkable, endearing and courageous back towards him. And I would like it that to be in response to what he is going to do for you. And I will tell you, and I'm going to ask you what it is that you would do. But I don't think it should be some small thing. If you are going to go, you might as well go for it. So, I mean, you might as well take all your chips, and at this point in your life, the kids getting older and things falling apart you might as well put your chips and play for the big numbers. Okay? So, what I, what I want you to do is, I would like you, in the next five weeks, and I want you to think about your response, cause I want you to do something extraordinary. So I'd like you, just for the next five weeks, I'm not asking you to do it for six weeks, or for seven weeks, or for eight weeks, only for five weeks. I would like you to take your paycheck and put it in your wife's hands for the next five weeks and she will do with it whatever she pleases. Okay? It will be an extraordinary move on your part. Since your husband has agreed to do that, what would be your extraordinary response to that for the next five weeks, what would you be willing to do yourself? Cause before you respond, you understand that, you would do with it whatever you want, however you want to spend it. You would have the complete responsibility, that's his agreement. 

00:12:00
JAY HALEY I cut out some telephone calls. You know I called, I said I wasn't sure the guy understood and that she understood that she was to have every cent. He wasn't to have a nickel. So he's emphasizing it again. If he had it on his person, we would have him give it to her right in the room. Cause you want it to start in the room, when it's a task that they may go out and decide not to do it and wander off. 

00:12:20
RICHARD BELSON So I'd like your response to be as courageous, as dramatic and as extraordinary as his proposal. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN Wife: The easiest thing for me to do would be to have sex with him. 

00:12:35
RICHARD BELSON How many times a day were you thinking about? 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Once. 

00:12:40
RICHARD BELSON Hm. Well, you could make it extraordinary by making it five times, or twice. 

00:12:50
JAY HALEY But this is an example of giving a straight forward sort of directive in a way with, uh, motivating the person well, describing it well, giving a good reason for doing it, being very specific, going over it to make sure they understand it, having it start immediately so it'll, uh, it'll continue. Which is part of how to demonstrate forward directive so it will come out how we want it. 

00:13:10
Follow-up 

00:13:10
JAY HALEY He saw them once a month for three or four months and they changed and decided to stay together, got along well, and, uh, it was impressive. And that was then the problem, and I think generally, you have to handle it, if people improve very rapidly. Because, uh, there's an imbalance of power is one of the ways to think of it. If people try to do things to get over a problem of some kind and they've done everything they can think of, and they come to you and you suggest something and they're over it in two or three sessions. You're just so powerful, they have to put you down. The only way they can put you down is by relapsing. 

00:14:00
Encourage a Relapse 

00:14:00
JAY HALEY So, what you have to do is prevent that and a lot of the ways it is to encourage a relapse. And say to them, you are changing too rapidly, I think you should move back and have the problem as you had it before. Erickson, being grateful as always, said to the people I'd like you to go back and, uh, have the, uh, same symptoms you had when you first came in. And see if there's anything from that period that you'd like to salvage. Which is a nice way to put it, and most people who give up the symptom have a nostalgia for it. There's something about it, that, uh, as awful as it might be, it also has some aspects of that it's attractive or they wouldn't keep it for one. But anyway, what he did with this family was another technique, which is, uh, is to be puzzled. They came in, said they decided to stay together, they were getting along well. They were holding hands. And he said, uh, "I don't understand this, how could this possibly happen?" And they said, "Well it just happened." And, he makes it puzzling to him it could of happened, therefore he didn't do it, therefore they don't have to relapse in relation to him is the logic to this. And, uh, this couple did very well. 

00:15:25

00:15:25
A Paradox with an Agoraphobic Wife 

00:15:25
JAY HALEY I was dealing with a series of agoraphobic wives, and treating them as a couple problem, which I think is sensible. And I, the, uh, this fireman brought in his wife who hadn't been out of the house for years. She could go out with her mother or with him, but she couldn't go out alone. So he had to take the kids to school and to the doctor and all this sort of thing. And he had enough. He said he wanted her cured so he brought her in. So I suggested that, uh, there was something they could do and that they would think it is silly. And you say that so they don't say it's silly, you know, because you've already said it's silly, yeah. And I said I wanted him, when he went to work the next morning, to tell his wife to stay home. And he knew his wife was going to stay home, she hadn't been out in years. But he should tell her that, and, and she was present when we said this. And he said okay and she said okay. And the next morning he told her to stay home. And it was funny, ha ha, they laughed about it. The next morning he told her to stay home, it wasn't so funny. And the third morning he told her to stay home, she went out of the house to the grocery store for the first time in seven years. And when they came in at the next session, it was a very upset husband saying, if my wife goes out alone, where is she going to go? And what is she going to do? And the wife said, "I've always said if I could leave this house, I'd leave with my suitcase in my hand." So you're right into a break-up of a marriage if you're not careful. You also need to expect trouble, or something unusual when you use paradox, because you get a real reaction in some cases, in most cases.

Being Unfair 

00:17:15
Jay Haley 

00:17:15
Rules of Relationships 

00:17:15
JAY HALEY One of the things that I think I've avoided and shouldn't have, back in the 50's where everything happened, there was this idea at that time, that couples had a theme. They, uh, there were rules they followed and these rules they had to follow. Once they had a rule, they were stuck with it. It would even start in courtship but it could then continue into old age, really, unless a therapist intervened. But, well then, some, some of these rules are not so pleasant. This is one that's a common one, that the, uh, the hu, the wife initiates what happens and the husband responds. So that, uh, he never initiates anything and she never waits for him to respond. She initiates it. And, uh, they, they can't get out of that. Often a woman will court a man and marry him and take all the actions because she initiates whatever happens. Then he, uh, responds to it. But after their marriage, she wants him to initiate something. She doesn't want to just sit around waiting for him to do something with him doing nothing. So she pushes him to initiate it. He gets mad because that's not the contract. He's supposed to respond, he's not supposed to initiate. So then you have a problem. How do you change this? I mean a lot of couples don't, don't mind that. But then you do get couples who don't like it and want to change and then you're into this problem because it's like railroad tracks. Once a couple is on it, they're on it. And you can point it out, you can shift it, you can task. But it's a difficult change. 

00:19:15
Don Jackson, MD Mapping couples 

00:19:15
JAY HALEY I think it's one of the one of the interesting things that Don Jackson wrote. In our recent project, when we were working, we thought we could map out couple's in terms of rules. That we could explain everything they do in terms of rules. And we couldn't get that far. I still haven't got that far. But I can still recognize a rule when I see one now. 

00:19:35
How to be Unfair 

00:19:40
JAY HALEY There's another issue that I just remembered. If you have a woman that initiates and a husband who responds and you would treat them equally. And you side with each, each one. You side with her and you side with him. You're confirming that relationship that she is supposed to initiate and respond. You're confirming that by your participation. And, uh, that's a problem. Because, you don't want to confirm that. But at the same time, you don't want to be unfair and side with one against the other, if you're a traditional marriage therapist. Actually what I, I don't think you can produce a change in marriages without siding with one against the other. Not necessarily inadvertently, but on purpose. Which is what I'll show here. But it's a situation where, uh, you don't want to reinforce the very thing you're trying to change. And you're doing that if you side with each one equally. You're saying the way you behave is correct, the way you behave is correct. And you don't want to do that, I don't think. But let me show you again, this is a young couple, very bright. Who, uh, are professionals, married about seven years. They came on the issue of whether to separate or not. And, uh, they were sitting for one session I believe. And, uh, did a general discussion. And we saw them each alone for a while. Did get that information. And this tape I'm going to show is the second interview. And they're on this tape because, as she says, she initiated what happened between them and he responded. Now he just doesn't do anything, he just responds. And she doesn't want that. 

00:21:35
Second Interview Whether Couple Should Separate 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN You, you should have it very clear in your mind as to whether this is going to get better or worse. Right now, you're locked. You're, you're stuck. I, I think you need to take time. There's no panic about this. It's been going on for a while. Changes you're going through. Changes in your career. Changes in your life. You're going into your 30's pretty soon. I, I must say, what I heard to night, Steven, you are in danger of losing your wife. I think, that what you're doing is absolutely wrong. I think you're making a mess of things, that you're pouting. That you're doing things to turn her off, by not talking to her, by not being aggressive, by not seeking her out, by not, not courting her. 

00:22:15
From "Unbalancing a Couple" (enacted) by jay Haley & M. Richeport-Haley 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN I think you need to go back to your romance. Maybe, maybe she did the courting. I think, now, maybe it's time you start courting her. And, and you're driving her away. Having to work those long hours, not spending time with you, not communicating with you. If I had to make a choice, right now, I would have to say that you're absolutely wrong. It's your fault and, and you've got to do the things if you want this woman as your wife. Because you're putting on the blame on (ph)Maime. You really have to take responsibility for this. And this is a good time of year, because it's Spring and the sap is rising. It's, it's the beginning of new life. New, new beginnings. This is the time for you to really convince yourself, if you really want to win her, you really have to make it very clear in your mind that, that you've done everything you can to win this woman as your wife. It, it's like a second marriage. No fault of yours. I'm going to put the responsibility on you. I know you won't like what I'm saying. It's a hard message I'm leaving you. And I don't see that anything Charlene is doing is contributing to it at all, I just, I think, that it's not the case. 

00:23:25
CHARLENE I must be doing something. 

00:23:30
STEVEN Let's talk about this. I think you're bullshit. 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN You really have to go after her, you have to court her. You really do. 

00:23:40
STEVEN She spends her time telling me that everything I am and everything I do is bad, is evil. 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN So convince her that it's not. You have to convince her by courting her, by going after her, by calling her during the day. 

00:23:50
STEVEN I call her during the day. Eh, I can, can't get through. She never, eh, is available to answer the phone. She's always busy. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN Take time off and meet her for lunch, don't wait, go after her. Don't let her out of your sight. She's a prized possession. If this is the greatest thing in your life, better than margarine, then she's going to melt. She's going to disappear. Now you have to take the offensive, and, and be aggressive. And don't fold under her criticism. She's just giving you a hard time. 

00:24:25
STEVEN Her criticism isn't just, "I don't like it when you do that, and, and I'm going out. I'm leaving." 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Go with her. 

00:24:30
STEVEN I'm not invited. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Well you don't to wait for an invitation. You're the man of the house. 

00:24:35
STEVEN She's never home, she comes home eight-thirty, nine o'clock every night. I'm the first one home every night, what can I do? 

00:24:40
JAY HALEY When one absolves a wife of all blame, she must come forward because she knows that's not true. On the telephone, the supervisor suggests that the therapist ask for specific behavior and not have an abstract discussion. 

00:24:55
STEVEN It's a fairly bull statement after one hour. 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN By tomorrow, what will you do so that Charlene does not slip through your fingers, so that she's not moving away from you? What can you do tomorrow? 

00:25:10
STEVEN Give up everything I believe in. 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN Well you can modify it. 

00:25:10
STEVEN Mm, I won't do that. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN Well that's... 

00:25:15
JAY HALEY In this extreme approach, if the husband criticizes the wife, the therapist must say he doesn't agree with that and that such criticism is being rude to his wife. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN Well that's not the type of person your wife is. I mean, it's almost as if you are being rude to her. I mean, if you were to just ask her the who, what, where, why just to get the facts, your wife would not be offended. 

00:25:35
STEVEN But I do, I know everything about her job, I know the names of the employees, I know what they do. 

00:25:40
JAY HALEY One risk of this extreme approach is that the husband must act or leave the marriage. When the husband gets thoughtful here, he seems to be deciding whether he wants the marriage. The wife becomes nervous, worrying about what he will decide. The therapist goes on pushing. The therapist ignores the resistance of the husband, and proceeds as if there is agreement on the plan. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN You have the task, Steven, of courting Charlene for the next two weeks. I want you to be as imaginative and creative as you possibly can be. Don't wait to be asked. Don't wait for her to make the first move, as she has done here several times tonight. You have to be the initiator for the next two weeks. Then we'll see what happens. What will prevent it from not working, Steven? 

00:26:25
STEVEN That, I won't do that. I won't want to. 

00:26:25
Two Weeks Later 

00:26:25
STEVEN I think I was pretty good at doing the things I was supposed to do. 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Precisely what was it that you did? I know that you are doing some neat things. 

00:26:35
STEVEN Well, I don't think I did anything wild and crazy. Uh, there weren't any horses in the house or circuses, but, um, we went out to lunch once. 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN And you arranged that? 

00:26:45
STEVEN Yeah. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN You didn't wait for Charlene to, to do so? You set it up yourself? 

00:26:50
STEVEN I took her to a restaurant and everything, it was a real very nice restaurant. 

00:26:50
CHARLENE It was very nice. 

00:26:55
STEVEN I sent her flowers after we had a fight on Sunday. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN What kind of flowers? Roses? 

00:27:00
STEVEN Nah, they were Spring flowers. 

00:27:00
CHARLENE They were beautiful. 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN Cut Spring flowers. You, you like cut Spring flowers. 

00:27:05
CHARLENE I do. I like cut Spring flowers. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN He, he has some work to do yet. But he has done some good things. 

00:27:10
CHARLENE He had to have the money. 

00:27:10
The Couple had Tow More Sessions and Decided to Stay Together 

00:27:10
JAY HALEY I didn't go on supervising this, but as I understand it, they only had two or three sessions and then decided to commit to one another. 

00:27:20
They were Past this Stage 

00:27:20
JAY HALEY They were past this stage. Whatever that stage was.

Changing a Couples Rules Using Paradox 

00:27:25
Jay Haley 

00:27:25
OBSERVING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:27:30
JAY HALEY The supervisor thought the couple could think of themselves in a more positive way if their therapist asked the couple to imagine that they had never had a problem with drugs or alcohol. Neither could imagine being cured. 

00:27:40
Ask them what problems they would have if they were normal, not ex-addicts? 

00:27:40
JAY HALEY The context in which the rules of the couple were expressed was a framework of thinking of themselves as defective because they had been addicted.

JAY HALEY They believed they were not normal like other couples. Their in-laws encouraged that view because of their addict history and were not helpful. 

00:28:00
Jay Haley is delivering suggestions to the therapist by computer 

00:28:00
JAY HALEY The woman complained that she was having trouble with their relationship. This is what brought them in. She said he didn't communicate, didn't want sex, and didn't want to show affection and he made her very jealous. The man complained that the woman constantly complained and didn't recognize that he was busy. He was a construction worker and also a musician, so he worked night and day. 

00:28:25
Ask her to complain and him to defend himself 

00:28:25
JAY HALEY To do something about the woman's complaining, a paradox was proposed. It asked them to do what they were already doing. It was evident that the rule followed was that the woman complained about the man and he defended himself. That was a rule embedded in their relationship. 

00:28:45
Ask him to criticize her and ask her not to respond 

00:28:50
JAY HALEY This was direct suggestion to the couple to change their rules. It was not paradoxical. Then they began to argue about issues like normal couples do around the house. He said she would be less overwhelmed if she went back to school or got a job. Both seemed overwhelmed at the idea that they were normal. A paradox was given to this proud couple. 

00:29:15
Say to get a better understanding of your attitudes about sex, it's forbidden to have sex this week. 

00:29:15
JAY HALEY They were avoiding sex, and to help them to get over this problem, they were instructed to avoid sex. What's your plan? 

00:29:25
PLANNING THE SECOND INTERVIEW A WEEK LATER 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Well I was hoping for a little more feedback from the group office sessions that we've had so far. Um, but my plan is to ask them, actually I feel like they're just going to come in and tell me about the sex, whether they did or didn't. Cause I told them not to, to abstain because of the tension and blah, blah, blah. 

00:29:45
JAY HALEY If you wanted to carry that on, you could start by saying, one thing I'd rather not talk about is sex, because that's a person's private life. So let's talk about something else. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN And then what? You think they'll resist that? 

00:29:55
JAY HALEY Then they'll try to talk to you about sex then. But I think it's helpful to have clear goals. One of the clear goals for out there was she complains and he, uh, he objects and then withdraws. 

00:30:10
The goal of therapy is to change a couple's rules. It cannot be done by simple directives. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN Um, I saw that he could function differently when I had told him that I plan I expected him not to do very well at it, he was quit adept at complaining towards her. But that's not the way they normally interact. So I might have a good idea about how (inaudible ) 

00:30:30
JAY HALEY (crosstalk)Since when do you think it's worse off... Let's start with them in some way to find out if this is the last session. 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:30:35
JAY HALEY And one way to do it is the, uh, classical, "What if this was our last session, what would you be worried about?" 

00:30:40
PLANNING THE THIRD INTERVIEW Disengagement 

00:30:40
JAY HALEY And if they get upset, saying, "Well last session?" Then you say, "Well I didn't say it was your last session. I just said what if it was?" But people go right to a problem usually if you do that. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, we saw that happen. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN That's true. 

00:30:55
SAY TO THEM, "YOU WILL HAVE TO CONVINCE ME YOU NEED THERAPY" 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY The therapist was surprised that the couple reported that things were going so well. After the discussion, she suggested they come back in six months, which was agreeable to them. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:15
JAY HALEY We'll talk about it, let, let's finish with this. 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN That was exciting to see how much they were... 

00:31:20
JAY HALEY It was extraordinary, really. 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)I'm amazed. They were, they were really, I mean they did some of their same stuff, but then I mean she backed up and he stepped up and... how did that happen? 

00:31:30
JAY HALEY I think it was... 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)It was so different than, I mean you shoulda seen them before. I don't know, she was crying all the time, and going, uh, I mean it was just completely different. 

00:31:40
JAY HALEY Take each case and say, "What is the outcome?" Have I succeeded with this case or failed with this case? On a scale of zero to ten, are they are zero in improvement or a ten? 

00:31:50
DISCUSSING OUTCOME 

00:31:55
JAY HALEY And it's, it's fair if you brought a case in through the course of the case, to either succeed or fail or halfway fail. But if you see them just once and you don't see them again, it has to be a great interview. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN As well, yeah. 

00:32:05
JAY HALEY But I just thought you might be interested in looking at your own work and seeing how complicated it is to do a simple study of whether somebody got over a problem or didn't get over a problem. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:32:20
JAY HALEY It's up to you. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Aw man. Um, hm, I'm trying to think, they were, having sex again. They were talking positively. She was smiling and not crying. 

00:32:35
JAY HALEY That's a big step. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN I know, she was, they were joking with each other and, I guess I'd give them a, I'd gotta give them like an eight or a nine. 

00:32:40
JAY HALEY Yeah, easy. 

00:32:45
[music] 

00:32:45
Affaris 

00:32:50
JAY HALEY Some people object to seeing members of the couple alone, because they, uh, find out about affairs and so on. And I think it's better to find out about them than to be working in the dark. Because sometimes a spouse will bring in the other spouse and to unload them on the therapist. It isn't that they want to improve the marriage. They want to save this person going out of his or her mind, when they leave them. And if you don't know that and you are busy trying to improve the marriage, it's kind of a waste of time. I think it's helpful too, to realize that affairs stabilize many marriages. That they have positive use. It isn't that these are just awful that something should be done about them, uh. There's tradition of affairs in Europe for example. The husband having a mistress or the wife having a lover. And a lot of couples get along better if there is, if they are involved with somebody else. And I'm not recommending that, I'm saying that, eh, you have to acknowledge this when you are dealing with couples with an affair that maybe it has a positive way of doing it. You know what it, my association is, Richard Stewart, uh, is one of the few people with some systematic ways of working with couples and he has, uh, a thing that we've all done, but he does it regularly. And he calls it a night out. What made me think of it is affairs stabilizing a situation. He showed me a tape once of a man was brought in as a depressed case, or it was a her with a depressed case. And Stewart sees husband and wife together and found out that they were in their 50's and the wife had just taken up with a 25 year old man and the husband was, the husband was getting ready to crack. And that was a problem for them. And the way that Stewart handled this is, he said to the husband, in the presence of the wife, "Is, is the affair what is upsetting him, and depressing you or is it the way your nose is sorta being rubbed in it all the time?" And the husband said, "Yeah, you know, I don't mind, it's kinda brought her back to life, the affair doesn't bother me. But I don't know where she's going when she goes to the grocery store so I'm always preoccupied about where is she going." So the way Stewart did is, he, he arranges a night out, the wife is to have a night out. Say on Wednesday evening, from seven to one in the morning. And that's her time and not to be questioned at all. If she wants two nights, she can have that. But she's not to see the young man any other time except that night out, so there's no question of her slipping away to meet him. And the husband is not to enquire into that. And the husband can have a night out if he wants to. And they stabilized this way. And they agree to that, and they hold to, she scheduled the affair. And it seems to be a relief to both of them. And, uh, it, it's would be a shame to break up a long marriage over something that's probably going to be temporary anyhow. So it's nice to find some way to stabilize it. Well, first of all, I think couples always know when the other is having an affair. It, if it's a weekend fling, then maybe not. But if there's any kind of relationship, then the spouse knows. They don't like to concede it, because then they have to do something. And so they'd rather not do something that might break them up. So I, eh, you do great. I don't mind the therapist having secrets with different family members. And, you know it used to be an idea you should reveal all to everybody, eh, which is a strange idea. But I think he talked to the wife about one of the first things you do is try to get her to recess for three months to give you a chance to see if the marriage will come through. And often they'll do that. Otherwise you handle it, you don't reveal it to the spouse, if you can possibly avoid it, if it looks like it's an ongoing steady situation and you can't resolve the marital problems without bringing it out, then you tell the wife to bring it out and take the consequences I think. There's different ways for different couples. We had one in which the husband had an ongoing affair for a long time and so did the wife. And they came into therapy when the wife's boyfriend died and the whole thing went unstable. So that they were very upset. But I think that's a way of life some people choose. Some people will work with a couple even separated. I prefer to tell them to move back together or to set a date when they are going to move back together. And either move back together or split. So that, uh, you can deal with some of the issues. And, th-there's no, you know it's like working with a family in a hospital. It's not really anything happening, they express their emotions and all, but they go home and they are separate from each other. They don't have any consequences to the session at home. And, uh, if you, with a family in a hospital, if you say this kid's coming out next Tuesday, the family begins to change its ways pretty rapidly. They begin to think seriously, "We're going to have to deal with this problem." And I think couples do that, if they know there's a date their going to have to move back together, they take everything more seriously. I think it's very difficult to bring a couple together when they're living apart, whether you arranged it or not. Because they begin to make other friends, they begin to get into activities without the spouse, uh, they begin to make a life for themselves in a separate place. And then, it's harder and harder to get back together again, I think. Although marriage therapy I think is one of the more interesting personally, I think it touches you personally more than other therapy. You know, basically used to say, uh, the probe you stick into research material when you're dealing with humans, always has another end that sticks into you. And I think that's more with couples, that, uh you get personally involved. That's why a supervisor uh, is, helpful. 

00:39:00
Using Penance as a Strategy in an Affair 

00:39:00
JAY HALEY I'll tell you an interesting one, if you want to appreciate therapist of the world. There's an interest in Porto Rican faith healers. And the one I'm thinking of is one who is in New York, this faith healer. And a man came in with his wife and said, uh, "My wife had an affair. And, uh, I don't want to kill her. Is there something else I can do?" And, uh, the faith healer said, "Let me examine the situation." He saw the wife alone. 

00:39:35
A Ritual as Penance 

00:39:35
JAY HALEY And he came out concluding that it wasn't the wife who had the affair, it was the spirit of his first wife who had the affair. And they had to ex, exorcise that first wife. So they would have peace between them. So he sent them up in, from New York, clear up into New England, to a little town out in the middle of nowhere. They went up there on the bus. And at that little town, they had to walk one mile to a tree, and at that tree they had to go through a ritual that got rid of the spirit. Then they came back, they caught the bus, they, it took them all day for this trek up into New England. But when that was done, it was done. Done, done, finished as a conversation piece, or it it's never referred to again. Uh, it's been taken care of. And that's a penance really, it was for both of them, in the sense it was difficult to get up there and back. 

00:40:40

00:40:40
A Metaphor with a Shy Couple 

00:40:45
JAY HALEY Erickson developed in a variety of ways. Uh, one of the ones that he liked to do that I always like, is he would take a couple that couldn't talk about something like sex, they wanted to do some changing about it, but they couldn't talk about it. 

00:41:00
Metaphor 

00:41:00
JAY HALEY So he would say to them, that he wanted them to talk about other things. And he wanted to talk to them about having dinner together. And how very important it is that a couple enjoy dinner together. The wife should enjoy the dinner. The husband should enjoy the dinner. And he asked them how they have dinner. Did they have it, did they have it by candle light, or do they do it just anywhere in the house? And, uh, then he says do you like appetizers to start the juices flowing or do you like to dive right into the meat and potatoes? And he does the thing on dinner that parallels sex and argues that if they become aware of it at all you should drop it or change, because they're, this is to work outside their awareness. Which is where part of the ethical issue comes from. And you should also do one more thing that many of people don't know and that is that you need to take a position yourself. You need to say it's important that you enjoy dinner together. Uh, everybody, every couple should enjoy dinner together. That is, you don't just comment, you take a position and say what ought to be done. At any rate, if you do that correctly, the couple will come in and have made some changes in their sexual relations and will think they originated that. They think they initiated it and you think you initiated it. But who knows who initiated it? But it's an interesting way of working that you should take some practice with it.

00:42:40
A Case of Dissociative Identity Disorder* Treated as a Couple Case 

00:42:40
*Formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder 

00:42:40
Historical Note: Up until the 1990's only 200 cases of multiple personality had been reported. By 1990 thousands of cases had been reported. Especially in cases of abuse, when there was no apparent cause for a problem, it was found that therapists could implant false memories in their clients through suggestion. This became known as the false memory controversy. 

00:43:00
JAY HALEY This is a therapist named (ph)Claridy, he's a very competent guy who works three or four hours from where we are and he brought this family up with some consultation. Cause he was friendly with her. And, uh, she's a woman who disappears. She has lapses of memory, which is the diagnosis of multiple personality. And, uh, what she'll do is call him from another town on a Saturday and say I don't know how I got here and where am I. And he has say look at the street signs and figure it out. It's a, uh, it's an interesting malady and it forces you to dis-, once you can get confident and thinking of symptoms as a two or three person phenomena, when something like this comes along. And it's hard to think of this as a soc-, as having a social function, or of having two or three people involved. She is, uh, she's been hospitalized two or three times and diagnosed, I believe, schizophrenic. Technically multiple personalities are diagnosed as schizophrenic and hospitalized several times before somebody assumes they are multiple personality and treats them differently. There's two schools that are pretty clearly differentiated. One is that this is psychopathology. And, uh, that it's a dissociative process, that it's a product of abuse in childhood and that the way they solved it was just dissociating and becoming something, somebody else. There's another school that argues that there's only, usually only two or three personalities and that it's not psychopathology at all. That it's an occurrence in which there are several personalities in one body. And that's Milton Erikson's argument. He treated it like these were real personalities, not a psychopathological state. And he had a lot of influence on me in terms of how to treat them, whatever you think. That you, from an Erickson view, you get the personalities to collaborate, just like you can get family members to collaborate with each other. You don't try to destroy one, or eliminate one, or extinguish it, or exorcise it. You get them to, uh, you get in communication with them in order to get with them. Can I see a show of hands, how many of you have worked with a multiple personality? Oh boy, a quit a few then you're familiar with it. It's an interesting problem that raises, eh, theoretical questions all over the place. In this case, it's a special problem because this woman, well a teenager wants to give up that little girl, baby and this woman is going to be asked by the court if she'd like to adopt it. And the therapist responsibility, question is should this woman, with her malady, take care of this little girl. And, uh, it's a difficult question because the court doesn't even know this, that she's a multiple personality and the therapist has the problem of whether to reveal this or not because of the confidentiality issue. But if he doesn't and she harms that baby then he's in real trouble. But if does then he's in real trouble with her and it's a valuable baby to her. So it's an interesting, difficult problem with practical consequences. The, uh, let me show you a little more of... 

00:46:45
ANNA Some of the others, you know, probably are feeling the anger. But I'm beginning to, enough communication from everybody to realize and put it into words and say something about it. 

00:46:55
Therapist Randolph Fiery 

00:46:55
RANDOLPH FIERY Okay Anna, and I think that is great and I think that is a lot of progress and change. And, what I'm saying is, it's not just an issue of, uh, that process taking place, but it's an issue of, uh, the, uh, destructive ones having to agree to get out of the way to make a contract. 

00:47:20
JAY HALEY See this, what he's now discussing, this woman has some disruptive personalities and has harmed herself physically over them. He's trying to deal with her, not only the issue of adopting the baby, but she's not taking care of the baby. So he's talking about getting the disruptive personalities out of there so that the baby will come to no harm. 

00:47:45
RANDOLPH FIERY They have to agree to bow out. They have to agree to that and you should be a part of that, you should be in position to be involved with that whole process of that happening. By selecting someone and saying that those destructive things won't be tolerated and, and we need... 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Tell the destructive people to go to sleep? 

00:48:25
[sil.] 

00:48:25
RANDOLPH FIERY As long as they agree, they can go to sleep, they can whatever, but as long as they agree to stay out of the way. 

00:48:35
[sil.] 

00:48:35
RANDOLPH FIERY We need an agreement from all, from every one of those destructive people, that they will agree to bow out. These chil... 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN It's unusual. The reason why they were destructive is because they... 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN (crosstalk(inaudible )) 

00:48:58
UNKNOWN Because when no one listens, and you try to tell them, the only thing that happens is, uhm... 

00:49:10
Jay Haley's phone supervision behind the one-way mirror 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Why I have to be disturbed anymore, because now, I'm aware of what goes on, what has happened is what I'm trying to say. And, that was the only way that they could get me to pay attention before. 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:49:35
JAY HALEY What, what they have is a, is a list, he's having them make a list of the destructive personalities and have them sign an agreement to stay out of it. This woman came in over these periods of amnesia she had. That would not only happen moment to moment in the sessions, but for weekends. But we worked with her quite a few hours before we began to think in terms this must have some social function and began to get her husband involved. The, uh, we were getting, we're interested in psychosis. And this, some middle aged women go out of their minds. And usually, the most successful treatment is to get their husbands to not put up with them. That is, to do something about the husbands. Then the woman settles down. In this case, this husband is so extraordinarily tolerant, he's been with this woman seventeen years. And, uh, she'll go away for the weekend and he'll say well she shouldn't do that. But he has no reaction of setting any limits, say I won't put up with this, this has gone too far. He's just a very kindly guy who is used to this and puts up with it forever. But by this time, we began to get him involved in this, involved in her treatment. And began to treat this as, uh, something that would be helped to have the couple problem. But the focus is still around of what to do in relation to the baby. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN You wanted the agreement. I took the last one below, I was married to you. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:51:18
UNKNOWN I have for eight months. 

00:51:20
JAY HALEY What, what she's saying is she has kept all the destructive personalities in line since she's had the baby, really, when she last came out of the hospital. But it does raise an interesting question of what's the problem? What're you trying to resolve? What do a directive about? When you have something as complicated as this. And this therapist is fond of this woman and feels she would really, get extraordinarily upset if she had to give up that child, if that child went to a foster home, which is where it would go. Cause the teenager has essentially abandoned it. But at the same time, if there is a court decision about it, the therapist pretty well has to give the court an advice that this child is at some risk, perhaps. So, uh, and it's a practical problem in this situation that he face, that I faced and he faced, really, even though it is primarily his case. And the court is so happy with the way they've been foster parents of these teenagers, that's why they want her to have the baby. They're very successful with young people, partly because they wanted children themselves and couldn't have any. I think it has to have something that's social in relation to the husband. And what she says is, she has a personality which is wife. And, uh, she does everything wants so naturally he's happy with her. And then she's the mother of the baby, she has that personality and she's a very good mother and to see her with that baby, she is very good with that baby. But, who, who is it that's good with the baby is the question. But is very tolerant, and, uh, I don't know whether if it's because he sleeps with wife but he puts up with a great deal from this woman. Anybody want to vote on, what would you do? Would you tell the court about this diagnosis? She hasn't left the baby alone in that period of time, but she has gone out of time and she hasn't seen her mother in 15 years. Her mother abused her terribly and so did her brother. And we were trying to get her mother in, and, uh, took her attempts to go in that direction as a desire to have her in. I don't know whether it's true of all cases of multiple personality were abused in childhood, but obviously it's the majority of them. 

00:53:45
Despite serious problems a long follow-up showed the family was living together and doing well 

00:53:45
JAY HALEY But then there just seems to be some that have to question it. It sounds to me like many of them were abused by mothers instead of fathers. One of the interesting things, too, is how seriously this is being taken. There was a judge on a criminal case dealing with a multiple personality, and had every personality sworn in so there could be no question about that later, which is a similar process, really.

00:54:15
A Serious Symptom Affects a Couple 

00:54:15
Abridged "The Guaranteed Cure" by Jay Haley and M. Richeport-Haley (enacted) 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN The first thing I wanna do is hear a description, in your own words, of what the problem is. Why you came in. 

00:54:30
KAY I have, um, anorexia, bullima, whatever you wanna call it. I eat, and throw up, eat and throw up. Maybe five times, sometimes 25 times a day. I can't stop. Um, I've been doing it since I was 18 or 19, about 11 years. Um. 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN Is it averaging 25 times a day now? 

00:55:00
KAY No. I'm sorry. Um, no, um. I'd say my minimum is about 4 times. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN So is that the average now? 

00:55:15
KAY No, that's my minimum, I'd say the maximum is three times that. 

00:55:20
JAY HALEY When there is an eating disorder and the client is married, it can be best to bring in the couple. This is not blaming the husband or the marriage, but is making use of the marriage to solve the symptom. The contract with the therapist is with both spouses. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Can you add your description to the problem? 

00:55:40
DON The worst part of it, to me, is the fact that Kay needs to be secretive in order to cover up her tracks. 

00:55:45
JAY HALEY There are therapists who think of symptoms as unimportant and wish to focus on what's behind them. Yet people's lives are built around symptoms. With all the pleasures possible, this couple defines a good day in their life as whether the wife throws up. Focusing on symptoms seems the best approach in therapy and wins the most cooperation from clients. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN This problem has been going on for 11 years. You haven't been married that long you haven't been married that long, you've been married for five years. Perhaps you could, start before the marriage and fill me in briefly. 

00:56:15
KAY Well, I can't give you details because there was nothing, there was no treatment. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN Not at all for the first five years? 

00:56:25
KAY No. 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN Where were you? 

00:56:25
KAY At home. With my family. Well, I live with my grandmother and my parents live next door. Um, I was heavy. I'd been on a diet since I was 12. Um, and I was on this one diet where you get shots and I discovered this really neat trick. That I could eat whatever I wanted and just throw up. So I started getting thinner, and thinner. Um, sometimes I would starve myself. I did that for long periods of time, and then I would eat and just throw up. And so it was continual. 

00:57:05
DON We had been married for about a year and she really went fast as far as weight was concerned. She was at 110. Then she went down to about 95 pounds. I mean, we lived in an apartment, we bought a house. We did all those normal things. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN You didn't know about the vomiting? 

00:57:20
DON No, not at all. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Not in the courtship period? 

00:57:25
DON No. It was well into the marriage. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN How far into the marriage? 

00:57:30
DON That's hard to say, um. I mean, it, it was actually at the hospitalization that I finally knew. I mean, even you said, finally somebody else knows about this. She went down to 70, 75 pounds. That's when I finally knew. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN So 70 pounds is your critical weight, anything below 70 pounds and you have to be hospitalized? 

00:57:50
JAY HALEY Although these questions seem casual, they're bringing out important information. When dealing with anorexics, it's important to have a doctor available and to find out what is the critical weight when there must be hospitalization. The therapist brings up what will be the theme of this therapy. Are the two of them committed to getting over this problem. 

00:58:10
UNKNOWN I want to ask, is, are you truly committed? I want you to think about this for a moment before you answer. Do you really want to get over this problem. 

00:58:25
KAY Some days I do. Yeah. But, somedays, I don't. 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN Well, what I'm asking for is a commitment now. The most recent time that you weighed yourself today, how much did you weigh? 

00:58:40
KAY I weighed myself this morning. I weighed 97 pounds. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN How about you? Are you committed? Do you want to see your wife get over this problem? Are you ready to put in whatever amount of energy, whatever amount of commitment, whatever it takes to have your wife get over this problem, once and for all? 

00:59:00
DON Well I can give you a similar answer, you know. Commit to what it takes. But you know, after a while, it wears down on you. You know, it's harder on Kay than it is on me. Because I, you know, I haven't been assigned any roles. You know, except at, as a reward. 

00:59:15
UNKNOWN So when treatment has been such that she has been good, you've come in... 

00:59:20
DON (crosstalk)I've been allowed to visit. 

00:59:20
JAY HALEY When a therapist focuses upon a symptom, all the details are important. There will be an intervention before, during or after. Here, the therapist asks for the necessary details. 

00:59:35
UNKNOWN What's typical situation like around a meal? I mean, I want, you can pick any, any meal during the day. I want to know details of, what did you think about beforehand, what your plan is, how you go about executing your plan and where do you go when you eat. 

00:59:50
KAY And then someone said, do you want to go to lunch. 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN What did you have for lunch again? 

01:00:00
KAY Well, first I had the cabbage and the coleslaw. 

01:00:00
UNKNOWN Did you eat that before you left? 

01:00:00
KAY Yes, because I was doing well. I was, um, then I went and I had the cheeseburger, bowl of chili, French fries, onion rings, then when it was time to go, I ordered the two cheeseburgers, grilled cheese sandwich. Two French fries. 

01:00:20
UNKNOWN So... 

01:00:20
KAY Then I stopped off at the store and, got the other things and I brought them back to the office and I ate all these things at my desk. And my stomach was out to here. I was like. And then I just went to the restroom and threw up. 

01:00:40
JAY HALEY At this point, the supervisor behind the mirror decided the prognosis was good for this therapy. It had not been decided what the directive or intervention would be. But still, whatever was done would require the woman's full cooperation. The fact that she was will to describe this gross and unfeminine behavior before two men indicates that she wants to get over the problem. Information about the families of the couple is necessary since they might need to be brought in. There is also a search for the function of the symptom in the relationship of the couple, and with their families. In this case, therapist and supervisor were unable to find a satisfactory hypothesis of why the symptomatic behavior was happening and why it was so severe. It's best to have a base line, an estimate of the frequency of the symptom. Ordinarily one would ask the client with the problem to keep track. In this case, it was thought important to involve the husband in the solution of the problem, therefore he should be involved in counting the frequency of the symptom. 

01:01:45
Intervention Session 1 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN What I'm thinking of asking you of doing, for doing for next week, is Don, I'm going to ask you to help me out. I want you to, keep a chart, a list of how many times Kay vomits in a day. 

01:02:10
DON You're assuming she's going to tell me, right? 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN Well, I'm assuming you'll be able to get that information and so you can bring it in here, next Thursday when we meet again. 

01:02:20
KAY So, wait a minute, does that mean, do you think I can get over this? 

01:02:25
UNKNOWN Well, I think it's really important that we keep track, that you keep a daily log of how many incidences occur within a day. 

01:02:35
JAY HALEY The main reason for this ending of the first session is because therapist and supervisor are uncertain whether they can solve this difficult problem, which has failed in other therapy. It was three interviews before a plan was derived which might succeed. 

01:02:50
Session Two 

01:02:50
Intervention Session 2 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN What I want you to do this week, so I want you to spend a little bit of time together, each evening, making up a list of what some of the consequences would be if this problem were solved. Now, this list should be at least ten items. I say ten items as a bare minimum. If you can think 50, don't stop at 15. But I want you to consider some of the consequences that this has solved. Now, this list is important for you and it's important for me as to whether or not I want to solve this problem. Okay? 

01:03:30
KAY K. 

01:03:30
DON Do you still want us to keep track of the episodes? 

01:03:30
UNKNOWN I'll let you decide that, and I'll support your decision. 

01:03:40
[sil.] 

01:03:40
Session Three 

01:03:40
JAY HALEY In this third session, the couple came in with two, single spaced type written pages of consequences of what will happen if they get over the problem. This discussion took the hour. 

01:03:55
KAY Stop being untrustworthy, apprehensive. I wouldn't have to lie. 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN What are some of the implications of that if you didn't have to lie? 

01:04:05
KAY You'd be able to be honest. I mean. 

01:04:10
UNKNOWN What do you think that would be like? If she didn't lie. If she were honest. 

01:04:15
DON Well I could trust her. I mean, and, and there's a whole undercurrent that goes along with that. Surrounding the, you know, food and eating. If I leave the room, I don't trust her. 

01:04:25
JAY HALEY The young woman is constantly preoccupied with her weight and she weighs herself many times a day. To break up this aspect of the symptom, she's asked to stop weighing herself. To keep the husband involved, and keep it a game, he is asked to weigh her and keep the weight from her. 

01:04:45
Intervention Session 3 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN One of the things I'm thinking of having you do this week, Don, is I want you to weigh Kay, on a daily basis. Now you should make a chart, like you did the first week when I asked you to keep track of her vomiting, of what Kay weighs daily. And I want you to not let her know, what it is. What her weight is. And I would ask you to not weigh yourself. 

01:05:10
DON I mean, I would have to get down and cover the numbers. 

01:05:15
UNKNOWN Well, however you want to do it. 

01:05:15
Session Four 

01:05:20
JAY HALEY When the couple came in the next week, she had not weighed herself and he had kept her weight secret. 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN It'll be two weeks before we get together again. 

01:05:25
KAY Right. 

01:05:25
Intervention Session 4 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN Now there's two things I'm going to ask you to do within the next two weeks. The first one is going to seem, pretty minor, pretty insignificant. The second one will, in fact, solve the problem. 

01:05:50
DON Do you feel twinges in your stomach? 

01:05:50
KAY Just like that? 

01:05:50
UNKNOWN Okay, so, the first thing I want to do is talk about the first one. On Saturday, Don, I want you to go on a tour, I want you to go to the Giant, go to Seven-11, go to McDonalds and I want you to buy that same lunch. And I want you to take that home. I want you to go in the kitchen and I want the two of you to discuss one of two options that you may have. The first thing, first option that you can do is that Kay eats everything. And you see to it, Don, eats all of it, down to the last Snicker bar, last Snickers bar, um, the last soda, that everything is consumed. Now, then after that, Kay, you can do whatever you want. I mean you can vomit, do whatever you want to do. Or, two of you can decide to take that food, and just throw it away. 

01:06:55
DON Just throw it in the garbage disposal and shove it down there? 

01:07:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, you can use the garbage disposal. These are the two ways you can throw away the food. One is through Kay, through your body. And the second is through the garbage disposal, through the trash can, through the toilet, however you want to do it. Now, this is in fact, the minor of the two things that I'm going to ask you to do. 

01:07:20
JAY HALEY This directive was paradoxical. The client was being asked to do what she was, uh, there not to do. By having this husband supervise it, there was a chance she would rebel against him and not binge. That is why the therapist asked the husband to insist she finish all the food. The couple returned and reported that she ate all the food in her husband's presence and then threw up. She left two candy bars and he did not insist she eat them. 

01:07:50
UNKNOWN And the second thing I'm going to ask you to do is, in essence, the foundation for solving the problem. Now, in laying this foundation is important to me to know that both of you are committed to do this, to having this problem solved. And what that foundation is, without getting too detailed into what the solution will be, is that Kay, in the next two weeks, you need to be, be, completely, totally, without fail, wholeheartedly honest to Don about how many times you vomit in a day. 

01:08:30
JAY HALEY By this fourth session the therapist and supervisor had a plan. They decided to use the guaranteed cure. In this procedure the therapist tells the couple that he has a cure that's guaranteed, and then he postpones telling them what it is. He puts them off for two weeks to think about it. When they come back to learn what the cure is, he talks about other matters. He ultimately gets to the cure after he's had them committed to it. 

01:09:00
UNKNOWN I don't want either one of you to do this unless you're totally, completely committed to having this problem solved. Because I will guarantee you a solution when you come back in two weeks. But if you aren't ready for a solution, then that's alright. 

01:09:10
JAY HALEY This directive illustrates how live supervision can be important. The therapist says he will guarantee a solution. He needs to say, "If you do what I say, I will guarantee a solution." The supervisor telephoned him to make that correction to avoid any misunderstanding. 

01:09:30
UNKNOWN I will guarantee you a solution if you do what I say and come back in two weeks. Sorta curious as to why you are tearing now. 

01:09:45
KAY I don't know. Huh. 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN So if you do what I say, this will be solved. 

01:09:55
KAY I'll do it. 

01:10:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:10:00
KAY Okay. 

01:10:00
Session Five 

01:10:05
UNKNOWN Eh, on Thursday, when you left here two weeks ago, the count was one, two, up to four on Saturday it went to seven. That highest was at seven. Okay. 

01:10:20
KAY Mmhmm, I went ahead and did that. 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN Okay. And on s, the following Saturday you went back up to four. I guess what I'm kinda taken aback by here is that you had no more than seven when the average before was around eight, up to 25 times. That's why I let you take the graph up to 35 times, so you could have that many. 

01:10:40
KAY Sorry to disappoint you. 

01:10:45
UNKNOWN Now, one of the things I told you guys last time you were here was, if you do what I say, this problem will be solved. 

01:10:50
DON I know, I know. We danced in the parking lot. 

01:10:55
KAY But I'm not, I'm not gonna committed to like, taking off my clothes and running down the street. 

01:11:05
UNKNOWN I can assure you it's not going to violate any moral values you may have. 

01:11:05
JAY HALEY The viewer might not approve the task given to this couple. The point of this film is not to how to do a particular task, but how to motivate people to follow suggestions. This couple would now do almost anything asked of them. 

01:11:20
UNKNOWN What I want the both of you to do, is the next time that you vomit, the both of you are to give me a penny. For me to do with, as I see fit. 

01:11:50
KAY (crosstalk)Okay. 

01:11:50
DON (crosstalk)Okay. 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN Are we agreed upon this? That the next time that you vomit, be it tonight, you can go out to dinner, you can go to McDonalds, the next time you vomit you are both to give me a penny to do with as I see fit? 

01:12:10
KAY Okay. 

01:12:10
UNKNOWN Okay, one penny that you are jointly to give me. 

01:12:15
DON So two pennies? 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN No, one penny the two of you are jointly to give me. That I will. Yeah. That I will do with as I see fit. 

01:12:25
DON (crosstalk)Oh, I thought it was a combination of the... 

01:12:25
UNKNOWN The second time, Kay vomits, the two of you are to give me two pennies. 

01:12:35
DON Okay. 

01:12:35
UNKNOWN Okay. And, again I will use this money as I see fit. Now the third time that you vomit, I want four pennies. And again this is for me to use and I want cash. I'm not interested in checks. I want cash brought here next Thursday at six o'clock. Now, the fourth time that you vomit, you are to give me eight pennies, eight cents. And again, this is money that I'm to do with as I see fit. 

01:13:10
JAY HALEY In which case there was an interesting collaboration between therapist and supervisor. The supervisor had done this directive before using dollars. He was concerned that the young woman might not be able to stop vomiting quickly enough and it would cost a lot of money. The therapist suggested using pennies, since the principle was the same and that was done. 

01:13:35
[sil.] 

01:13:35
Session Six 

01:13:35
KAY Here's one dollar and 28 cents. 

01:13:40
UNKNOWN That's all? 

01:13:45
KAY Well, we didn't realize how quickly it doubled so we went home and wrote it down so we would know and then we figured it out. 

01:13:55
UNKNOWN Okay. Now did you... 

01:13:55
JAY HALEY As few as 11 vomits would cost them over 1000 dollars, and then two thousand and four thousand and so on. If she continued to vomit, the couple would be bankrupt from doing what they agreed. One should keep in mind that the agreement was that the therapist could do with the money what he saw fit. If necessary he could give it back. Fortunately that issue did not arise. 

01:14:20
Session Eight 

01:14:20
JAY HALEY The couple went over the list of consequences that would occur if she gave up the problem. 

01:14:25
UNKNOWN Says Don would be more proud of Kay. 

01:14:30
KAY Aren't you? 

01:14:30
DON I actually am. 

01:14:30
UNKNOWN Has that occurred? 

01:14:35
DON Oh yeah, it's occurred already. 

01:14:35
UNKNOWN Cause you were beaming last week. 

01:14:40
DON I, uh, hmm, she's been to dinner on a business trip, she got promoted. Well, unless I've been misled, I think we're 100 percent. 

01:14:55
JAY HALEY The therapist saw this couple once a month for six months to be sure the improvement continued. Then the therapy ended with an emotional farewell. Six months later there was a follow-up and there had been positive results. The wife had stopped vomiting and was more self-confident. The husband was more sure of himself and more substantial. The therapist had learned a new technique in therapy.
