Daily Evocation of Spiritual Meditative Self-therapy Enhances Positive Affect for the Incarcerated By. Dr. Jeffrey Po 

00:00:20
NARRATOR What I'm going to talk to you today is about, um, using meditation or the system of meditation, uh, in prisons. First, I deal a lot, uh, with prison, prisoners. I've been in prison work for the last six or seven years. And, uh, of course initially when I started doing prison work, I was drawn into a prison called Salaran-Ken (ph) in Singapore. And they were all the drug addicts. Uh, you know, it's tough dealing with drug addicts because they're drug addicts, and I'm not a drug addict. And I remember in my first, um, session with my first client, uh, I met him. It was just a bare room, two chairs, uh, a table and, uh, so, he came in. I said I'm Jeffrey, ah, it's a Malay guy. You're the new counselor. I said yes, I'm the counselor. Ah, he's talking in Malay, so I could understand, okay, and he spoke in Malay and he said oh, you're the sixth counselor. I said oh my god, he's got five others before him, and he's been, that means he's been in and our six times, and those five have not been successful. So, you understand, then, you know. And, uh, there are how should I start, then. And, uh, how do I, you know, establish rapport with him, you know, as counselor you need to establish rapport, trust and all this sort of thing, and I said okay, the best thing is that, I talked to myself, that you'll talk things in general. And of course the, being a drug addict and being cooped up in the prison for, I think, the last few years, in and out, and we started talking about, and I learned in addition, I learned (?? ) right. And, Batam it was sort of the sex paradise for Singaporeans, a weekend, they run off to Batam to have fun and karaoke and come back to Singapore. And admittedly, I think, we struck that rapport there. So, it was fun, it was nice. Now, it went on and, uh, subsequently I got more experienced in handling them, but the first time when I had, you know, experience handling a group. These are also drug addicts, there were 14 of them, the majority were the Malays, yeah. It's, you know, I Singapore, if you'll meet a Malay prisoner, the chances are that he is in for drug addiction. If you meet a Chinese prisoner, the chances are that he's in for theft, fraud, uh, illegal money lending, financial swindle, all the financial part. If you see an Indian man in it, the chances are that he's in for drunkenness, wife bashing, fighting, so these are the rough profile of three groups. And I was with 14 of them, majority Malays, and then the Indians and the Chinese, and we're supposed to start the sort of session about family bonding and all that, because they've got these programs in prison, and, uh, I tried. That was my first time, it was about five years ago where I tried a little bit of meditation with them. Now, the funny thing in Singapore is that the authorities do not allow us to work on meditation with a group, with any group. Now, so, I asked, you know, why can't we do meditation with a group, it's good, meditation is group. He says no, meditation means that they're supposed to empty their mind. So, we don't want prisoners to empty their mind because if they empty their mind, they're going to think of, then they'll try to think of how to escape. So, no meditation. Fine, okay. And I told myself my god, it takes people half an hour to get from the outside of the main road to get into the and walk past the prison compound, going through about six or seven, you know, gates and all that. When this opens, that closes, when that closes and this opens and all that. And there is so much security, how, no, 30 foot fence, electrified. How are they going to plan to escape? Okay, then, I said forget meditation, and, uh, I used the word relaxation. That's okay, you can get them to relax, but no meditation. Okay, okay, fine. That is our prisoner, authorities. But anyway, today I'm going to focus on my own experience of what I've done because I've read in many places that, uh, meditation do help those incarcerated and so forth. But the thing that I've asked myself is that how do they practice, then, because do they practice daily or once a week, or when? Because I see them once a week and what happens in between then? Alright, so I was curious and I said okay, I'm going to set about finding out whether, if they're asked to do daily, whether or not it benefits them. But of course, I did not report this to the authorities because if I reported this to the authorities, first of all, they will ask me for a plan, uh, you know, all sort of thing, then they will say okay, ownership of whatever your result belongs to the prison authorities, and I'm not be able to bring anything to you, and it's a big mess and a big hoo-ha, and I've got to talk to the ministry of law and home affairs and so forth. So, I said best not to let them know, then. So, these are illegal, uh, results that I can, I will present it here, but not in Singapore. And these are my personal findings. Huh? 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:07:03
NARRATOR No, he can't, I can. Unless, unless you go back for it and you report to them. Alright. Uh, now, but I have a number of difficulties there, and as we go through the slides I will show you what, uh, are the difficulties. Uh, but that's just to summarize. One of the difficulties is language, uh, because, uh, many of the, the, those incarcerated there are either Mandarin or dialect speaking, and they like to speak in dialects, especially the Hakka, Hokkien dialects. That's one. And, uh, very questionable, this was done in a group setting, and I've got those who dropped out from primary level, right through university level. So, there is a wide range of, you know, of education level. In fact, I've got one of, one or two lawyers or so who was there in prison, and one or two, uh, MBAs, you know. These are been fraud, or they tried to forge signatures and so forth. So, there are this profile, the profile, which is, uh, I couldn't get, couldn't and, uh, the other difficulty is that you do not get the same crowd every time. Because sometimes you start with 14, 15, 16, and in each session you see that five have been taken away to do some work, and another three taken away for some other program, computer literacy program and so forth. Uh, but the net result is that I do find some sort of a trend and they're quite happy with, with what has been done. I noticed that in, uh, in prison, when a person first come to prison, there's a lot of anxiety, right? I mean, I don't, have any of you been to prison? No, I mean not as a counselor, as a prisoner. As a prisoner? As a counselor? Okay. Okay, as a visitor. I'm talking as a prisoner, going in handcuff and all that, alright. So, the first thing after getting your handcuff off, they shave your head, shave your head then you remove all your clothing, then you put on the prison clothing which is shorts and a T-shirt. Then you go through the trauma of having your fingerprints and photographs taken all over again, and you go through the process. And, uh, what goes on inside his head. Who will I sleep with? Obviously they can't, they don't give him one cell per prisoner, it's going to be too expensive for society to support, one guy in one cell. So, usually the cell has about five people, or those about to be discharged, about 20 people. Those about to be released. Now, so, if I'm a prisoner there, who will I be sharing my, my cell with, number one, number two, what sort of people is inside? Are they drug addicts, swindlers, charged with manslaughter, or what? Now, so, I happened to be dealing with those with not so, um, the crime is not so so serious as murder cases and so forth. It's just about the secondary one, the manslaughter case, the drug addicts, the molestation case or whatever. So, it's a bit mild, so okay. Now, so, here's that level of anxiety when he goes in. Finally, when he's going to the cell, the door shuts, no. Has he been look here, hi, my name is Jeffery and I'm a new prisoner that's in here, I'm going to share a room with you for the next three years. No. He probably doesn't know what to do, and the others will be sizing him up, you know. They start to think. Somewhere or another the ice will break, they'll ask him, the first question is really why are you here, or why, what's your charge? But this is Hokkien is a very rough language, and it's you come for what, you know. Okay. Now, In the previous one, in the Salaran-ken that I dealt with, it's worse because they, these drug addicts are also gangsters, and gangsters got their different group areas. So, when you come in and I see you, the first thing I ask you, which member are you in. Are you a gang member? So if we find out that we are rivals, you have to pray that we don't share the same cell. Now, so, when they come in there is this very highly stressed anxiety level. Of course, some would get over after one or two months, some will take longer. Some will probably, you know, two, three years. And some of them go, we call them the tycho, the tycho is the big brother who is outside, he is a gangster somewhere. He doesn't worry because when he goes in, he might meet his own gang members there. So, he's okay then, he's got his protection, yeah. All right. So, for the last, um, five years, uh, five years I was given groups to counsel, and this is, uh, this bend towards what is known as religious counseling, and being a Buddhist, then, I was asked to do Buddhist structure courses, because in prison there's no Buddhist structure courses, there's just going in. So, I'm the first one to organize a Buddhist structure course for these inmates, and I get classes and that class runs for 16 weeks. So, I thought oh well, 16 weeks is not bad I can do my experimentation there, and that's how I will start. Individual counseling is difficult, and with Mandarins it's difficult and Indians more difficult, because, uh, when you try to ask them to meditate, you know, what meditation itself is, is, uh, you know, taboo and and it is not welcomed there. So, I've done with this, uh, various groups of these, uh, Buddhist, so-called Buddhists. They claim to be Buddhists, but I think more of them claim to be Buddhists so that they can get out from the cell to come to class, which is air conditioned and with at least three hours out of the cell. Um, and, uh, I'll show you the results of what happened, okay? 

00:14:30

00:14:30
Personal observations - 1 

00:14:35
NARRATOR Alright. So, these are personal observations, my personal observations, nothing to do with the Singapore prison authorities, nothing to do with the Singapore government. So, um, so it is experience I committed over four years which I have accumulated, and I have only documented the last groups, then. Because before that, I, you know, I did not document anything, because I came to prison and out of prison, they check everything, pocket, my, you know. I don't have hair, so they couldn't check hidden in the hair there, um, but they are very thorough. So, whatever, whatever information that I have, I have to bring it in in my head and bring out in my head. So, unless they ask me, you know, you know the story of, um, these, uh, the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu? You know the book of teachings, how is it, in the book, isn't it the Tao teachings? The story was that he was about to leave China, and that time, one of the rules in China was that you cannot bring anything out from China, so whatever um, you have, your possession, you have to leave in China, then you can get out of China. So, this guy, Lao Tzu, went to the border and there was the border guard there, and the border says look, you can, uh, leave anything, whatever you've got you've got to leave behind. He says I've got nothing, except what's in my head. So, the guard says okay, then leave your head behind. Alright. He says I can't leave my head behind, then how do I go? Go without your head, then. Then he asked the border guard, can you suggest something. Then, finally the border guard says why don't you empty your head. Okay, fine, empty the head, take out his brain and empty the head. But that's not possible either. Then, he sat down, then he wrote the book the Tao teaching, and then he went to the guard and says I've emptied my head and it's here now. Oh fine, we keep this and you can go now. Alright. So, that was a story. I think there's several versions of it. This was one version that I heard, the origin of the book, the philosophical book. Alright. Um, and the profile of those incarcerated that I, in this group, are the substance abuse, CBT, credit card fraud and manslaughter. And manslaughter is interesting because, um, those few who have been charged with manslaughter, they're not the young, but old folks. Now, what happened, I asked them what happened. I went to karaoke, I got drunk, somebody looked at my girl, I got angry, I take a bottle and bashed it on his head. Alright. So, the poor guy died. So, under influence of liquor is manslaughter, it's not actual murder. So, they're in, this is 50, 60 years old, you know. 

00:17:40
Personal Observations - 2 

00:17:45
NARRATOR Okay. Uh, age median is early 30s to 50s, they are all Chinese there. Sex, males, primary education to degree education and medium instruction of English. The problem is that because there's a couple of words, um, in Tao that's been used that has got no translation to the dialect, the Hokkien dialect, so it's a bit difficult. Now, the class size is 25, and duration is 16 weeks, two hours per session. 

00:18:10
Personal Observations - 3 

00:18:15
NARRATOR Now, so two hours per session, I can't be asking them to relax for two hours, they would probably murder me there, they would probably create a riot. Because these people, you know, the prisoners are very, are every aged people, and you say the wrong thing and they just flare up then. The only thing that's restraining them is that, um, I'm given an alarm, you know what is the alarm, in case of emergency, I'm supposed to take out from my pocket and pull the pin out and it goes wan wan wan, and all the police will come and whatever, okay. Um, but I was thinking that by the time I put my hand inside the pocket and try to get it out from my pocket, I'll probably get a blow on my face first. Uh, but, uh, you've never heard of a sound before, it's a very shrill sound, it's quite frightening also. Because there was one occasion accidentally that a pin dropped inside my pocket, then it went wan wan wan, and the prisoners went into panic state, I went into panic state also wondering what was happening. And it's your pocket, the police came, they say what happened? I said my pocket. They said what happened, I said the pin came out. Oh, the pin came out. Then they gave me a new one, it was okay. But it created a sort of panic, lights were on, and you know, whatever cell doors automatically shuts, it goes clang, clang, you can hear the sort of thing. Okay. And, uh, gangsters and hooligans not included because none are hardened. So, I don't deal with hardened criminals or gangsters in these, uh, sessions. 

00:20:05
Personal Observations - 4 

00:20:05
NARRATOR Now, most came from dysfunctional families, uh, but many of them have got family support because, I think, um, maybe the wife wanted to know when he gonna come home and start working again to earn some income to the family. And, uh, all of them are the first timers. So, um, not too bad as first time. Because, I focus on the first timer because first timers are people who are quite anxious about the situation. So, what I wanted to do is that with meditation, or relaxation therapy, how will this help them to reduce their state of anxiety. Because if they're anxious and they have this high level of anxiety, they become very edgy. And some of them have even got angry with the warden, the officers there, and that's no good. You see, because these people are very sensitive to, to sounds. They are, they are audio people. And sometimes, you know, prison wardens, they're not, the words that come out from their mouth are not always pleasant, alright. You know, prisoners, the warden, the different people walking around, you, sit, or you, and some of them don't like it. And, uh, like what you know, we should have said. Normally they would react before they think a little bit. And there are instances where sometimes the warden says you, come here, and they'll reply what you? They are in prison. So, by replying what you, I mean it's offended the warden. If the warden's okay, fine, but if the warden's not okay, if he has got up on the wrong side of the bed, then this guy's in trouble then. Because, uh, there's supposed to be some sort of discipline and respect in the prison. Uh, now, so for this, um, structure, it is good that I've been doing, I have had six intakes in all, yeah. And each intake is for 16 weeks, that means about four months. So, in one year I've got two intakes with two months rest in between. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:35
Personal Observations - 5 

00:22:35
NARRATOR Uh, so, the mental and emotional state of those incarcerated when entering prison is that they're anxious, they're depressed, they're confused, and they have difficulties adjusting to prison schedules and programs. Now, one of the schedules is your dietary, your food and the timing of the food. Imagine having breakfast at five o'clock in the morning and lunch at about 10 o'clock in the morning, and dinner five o'clock in the evening, and thereafter there's no meals, no more meals. They've got to readjust. One time of meal, no choice, it's just one bowl, no more, no less and usually just, uh, a sausage an egg or a vegetable. So, if you're a big chicken rice fan, there's no chicken rice. You've had a great, what they call Indian food of roti whatever it is, there's none there. So, it's very sparse, and they sleep on the floor with just a one inch mattress with as very light blanket and no pillow. Okay. So, life can be quite hard. But by the same token, I mean, they're in prison and it's supposed to rehabilitate them, but it doesn't work that way. I think the prison authorities are acknowledging that it doesn't work. 

00:24:10
Personal Observations - 6 

00:24:10
NARRATOR Alright, uh, so, the engagement of meditative techniques to elicit the relaxation response and for the inmates to find meaning while in prison started with last two intakes. So, it was the last two intakes that I started documenting and started to observe, uh, what is happening. Before that, the previous four intakes was just doing what I was supposed to do there. Then, you know, I said, you know, I'll get it, document it, and get that, some statistics so at least I know whether it is successful or not. To ask the questions. Now, the other thing is that, uh, about meaning while in prison. 

00:24:55
[sil.] 

00:24:55
NARRATOR I found that in prison counseling, when you're, for instance in the one to one face to face counseling with the prisoners, um, don't try to ask too much about meaning of life. They don't think so much about meaning of life. They just there and they want to do things the way they want to do, and they do it. Okay. And if they feel like went outside, if they feel that they want to do it for drugs, they do it for drugs. If they feel that they want to go somewhere, they go somewhere. They don't think very much further than what they're doing. Now, so, when you ask them, um, I used to ask them, I said what do you think that has led you here. They're, what were your parents like. It's all, they're sort of show signs of, you know, apathy. Now so, when you try to welcome them in your, it's supposed to be a rehabilitating process. Counseling is part of the process, asking them do you think that life is this, they don't think of that level. It is a sort of present, they just behave on impulse and that sort of thing. So, but then I was thinking that maybe when they're in a relaxed state in a group setting, we can probably bring this topic up. And then the quiet moments in the cell they can sit down and maybe get some thinking to their own meaning of the events of their own life, what have led them to, to be incarcerated and the future, what's gonna happen. They just can't be drifting along from day to day, even when out of prison, yeah? Now, we also know that many of them, when then get out of prison, uh, their first issue is that they can't find a job. And this has been an issue between the private sector and the governmental sector. The government has always been passive, giving the message that the private sector has got to be socially proactive and engage them and employ them because, you know, they have to live. They have done their part and they have been incarcerated, okay, employ them. No. They've done this all to the private sector. So, we asked the government why don't you employ them, we cannot. I mean, how can we employ a prisoner doing police work? How can we engage, no, those incarcerated doing this job, that job, you know. The government section will not take those who have been incarcerated, because when you apply for a government job, there are two questions, have you been in prison before, you say yes, you know, you're gone. If you've been charged with something, or have you been in a mental institution. I don't know whether it's in Australia same thing or not, but it is in Singapore. So, they have difficulties in finding job, and usually the jobs are quite low pay also. Uh, many of them, many go out if they are still married, they find that the spouse has been run off with another man, and the house has been sold, and they've got no house. Uh, some of them go back to dysfunctional families again, insulting, quarreling and all that. And invariably you find that after around two months, they will purposely commit a crime and get back to prison again. This is sort of a safe place for them. They know the procedures, they know they're going to eat, they know what time to sleep, they know what time to get up, they know what time to bathe and brush the teeth and all that. But after some time, they get into the habit of wanting to come back to prison, and that is why in Singapore, uh, you've got the two fastest growing institution. That is the prison institution and the mental institution. Okay. We are adding more and more buildings to a hospital. It is very sad, but it is happening. So, uh, we are taking, making a lot of effort to try to rehabilitate them by giving them lots of program, uh, and unfortunately the uptake is, is small. Now, for instance, about two weeks ago, now, I have my other business, and I was looking for a fork lift driver, you know fork lift driver. So, uh, there was one guy who was in a halfway house. Halfway house means he's about to be released, but he's supposed to get a job, otherwise he goes back to prison to serve the remaining part of his sentence. So, they found for me, a guy who has got a fork lift drivers license, then I employed him. Good pay, but after three days, oh, he did not turn up to work. Then, uh, when I call up the home and says what happened to this guy, they say oh, this guy is sick. He was not sick, he was complaining that, uh, the lunch time was not enough, the tea break time was not enough, uh, people are talking behind his back, after three days. But nobody knew he was from the halfway house. They thought he was just, but then, you know, he felt guilty or something. Uh, then he says, um, no, I can't wear boots. Work men have to put on the work safety boots, no, because I've got the pain in my heel, I cannot put on boots. Three days. So, I've got no choice but to send him back. Now, so, when I asked him the question, I says are you sure you want to go back, he says yes. I said do you know what is going to happen to you when you go back? He says yes. I say fine, go back. But I think he forgot, because they would have told him that if he comes back, they would look upon that project as a failure and they will send him back to prison. That means he was given a chance to go to the halfway house to rehabilitate himself, but he did not take the chance, the opportunity. Now, he didn't think that far. He was thinking only of the immediate normal day, I want to go back, that's fine. I don't want to work. So, uh, yeah. You get, there's a lot of people with such mentalities that you're working with when you're doing this prison work, yeah. It is vastly different when I do work with the elderly. Now, with the elderly, 90 percent of the time, you're dealing with elderly, with elderly, 90 percent of the time, when you ask them how are you, the first reply, I want to die. So, you are suicidal assessment, but it is difficult, because this is the style of the manner of the speech that is here, I want to die. At first well, no, do you worry, yes, anxiety. So, all the negative things. But actually, when you come to them, yes they're tired, they're very very tired, they're mentally exhausted, physically exhausted. 85 years old, waiting for government, uh, payouts and living in a one room flat all by themselves. The define death as a good option. So, as a counselor, you are right there suicidal tendency. I don't know. But unfortunately, about two months ago one of them jumped down, he couldn't take it anymore. Okay, back to this. 

00:33:05
Limitations of presentation - 1 

00:33:10
NARRATOR Now, okay. Some of the limitations that I have, I've already explained to you that I'm not able to have any statistics, so whatever statistics in the head, and uh, very fortunately, the prison authorities don't ask me to leave my head behind. No, so, statistical numbers obtained verbally and/or by show of hands. I can't distribute any forms, I can't bring in any piece of paper and so forth. So, through the process I ask put up a hand how many of you benefit, how many don't benefit and that sort of thing. And, uh, I'm not able to record findings in writing so. I didn't want to. So, this, uh, presentation is therefore a private sharing with you all. So, please don't email the Singapore government. 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:33:55
Core beliefs of the programme 

00:34:00
NARRATOR Uh, so, the core beliefs of the program, actually the program is that the prison authorities believe that some sort of English medium presentation to English speaking audience would be beneficial. Now, they found that in this, in the prison, uh, what to call it, the community, there are many Chinese, there are English speaking. Okay. And, uh, there are not, um, Mandarin orientated, but they are more English orientated. But in the past, uh, there is no sort of, uh, English, um, speaking counselor that was in there, and, uh, there's no structure for them about rehabilitation through the English speaking medium. It was all Mandarin. Even in Buddhist counseling it was more Mandarin counseling rather than English speaking counseling. Now, I think there is a difference here, to tell you there are some differences between the Mandarin speaking counseling and the English speaking counseling. The Chinese speaking counselors or the Mandarin speaking counselors, they tend to focus on what is known as Mahayana Buddhism. That is the later development of Buddhism that happens about three, four, 500 years after the death of the Buddha. It was a development that, uh, from India where Buddhism migrated to China and to, to Japan and Korea and so forth. So, they tend to focus on that aspect because they're trained. The English speaking, um, Buddhist counselor tend to focus more towards the early part of the Buddhist teaching. That is the southern style, and there can be some, you know, differences in opinion within the two traditions. Now, but the prison authorities felt that we need English speaking also. So, I was picked to design the course and I was asked to do these things. Now, the incarcerated are privileged to receive religious/spiritual instructions if they requested for. Okay, this is one thing where I think in every country there is such a thing where if a prisoner says I want religious instruction, I want to be religious trained, the prison authorities will have to accommodate him. Uh, so, this offered them hope for recovery, offered them, offered incarcerated to live life on life's terms, okay, and not on their own terms. These people are all, they're very ego-centered and self-centered, these prisoners usually. They think of themselves and they don't think of even the family and the children and so forth. So, it is this program, uh, with its core beliefs, that's why the program was started. 

00:36:50
Alternative techniques in Psychotherapy and Counselling? 

00:36:50
NARRATOR Now, today's psychologists are increasing integrating complimentary and alternative medicine techniques into their work with clients. So, I think they found what happens one to one counseling that could work, one to one counseling sometimes don't work, because when you get the staff, prisoners, it's difficult to work with them. And then, uh, the prison authorities have got sort of, uh, a rule that you're supposed to see a client for seven sessions is all. And whether he's okay or not okay, you're supposed to close the session and move on to a new client. Alright. And, uh, we found, I found with drug addicts seven sessions is not enough. We've got to talk and talk and talk with them. And, uh, because sometimes they are, they are not focused. You, when you try to probe into the past, they will not reveal, or they bluff. We know them, just they don't want to say anything and you've got to ask again and again, and finally you say that ah, but you know, two sessions ago you said that. Ah, it was just a joke, you know, they tell you. Nothing serious. And it, you've got to start all over again. 

00:38:20
Mindfulness Meditation 

00:38:25
NARRATOR So, again, uh, mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness training boosts test scores and showed significant improvements. So, in other words, this technique of, this, uh, system of using mindfulness meditation, um, has worked and, uh, I was thinking whether or not it can work with these people or not. But of course, in a religious, under the religious setting, I say under Buddhist religious setting, mindfulness meditation is not the only style of meditation. There is also, uh, the positive part, there is also the transformative part. There are so many other things that are involved. And, uh, try to meditate itself is not sufficient. You've got to try to change the whole psyche of the, the person. Meditation just means sitting down and focusing on certain thing and be mindful of certain thing, that is all. But then I was thinking that if I could just achieve that part. I mean, not so bad because after all there's only 14 sessions and, you know, if you can get them to think about the behavioral consequences, or what happens if they behave a certain way, I mean, I think that's all that I can do. 

00:39:45

Research questions - 1 

00:39:50
NARRATOR So, uh, I started off by asking them about seven questions. And them just by show of hands I will ask them. Have you been taught meditation before? Do you practice daily? Do you feel anxious in your present environment? Do you feel depressed in your present environment? Do you wish to learn meditation? Do you think meditation can help you reduce your anxiety, depressed and stressful state? Can you commit two sessions of meditation practice each of 15 minutes duration morning and night? All right. And, uh, just simple questions and just a show of hands, I asked them something. 

00:40:30
Research Questions - 2 

00:40:30
NARRATOR Now, for intake number five, uh, these are the answers that I got. The question one about learning meditation, seven said they've learned and 14 said they've never learned meditation. So, it's surprising that they've gone for Buddhist counseling and they, at least they were not informed about things like meditation. Uh, out of the seven who meditate, six of them do it daily, there is 15, the others don't. Now, do you feel anxious or no, 21 said yes. Even after a few months there, they still feel that anxiety level. They're not comfortable with prison life. Depressed, about 20 of them said they're depressed, although I couldn't do the depression test and I could not find out the level of depression. But they say they're depressed. And maybe sometimes they're moody or something of a melancholy or whatever it is, but they feel a sense of lost, yeah. And, uh, learning meditation, 21 of them said they all want to learn. Um, whether or not meditation can be helpful to them, they said yes, it can be helpful, and 21 are prepared to commit. Alright. Going to such practices, um, twice a day, each session 15 minutes in their cell. Now, later on I found out something that many of them don't do this two times per day. You know the reason? They may be the only one doing the meditation, closing the eyes, and the other four are will be disturbing this guy. You know, so they get disturbed and the other four will be talking loudly and trying to distract him. So, this poor guy although he wants to do it, but he's not in a position to do it. Now, for, we just did number five. 

00:42:35
Research questions - 3 

00:42:35
NARRATOR For number six, have you done meditation before again, seven says yes and 13 said no. Meditate daily, four says yes, 16 don't, they don't. Now, this group is a bit better about anxious, are you anxious, five said yes 15 said no, they're not anxious. So, I don't know why. Are they depressed, none of them are depressed. 20 said they're okay, they're not depressed at all. So, maybe this lot, this intake, this lot, which is, uh, was six months from that intake, maybe this lot of people, their profile is different. So, they don't feel anxious. Maybe they've been in several times. Okay. Now, but 20 of them would like to learn meditation, and 16 felt that it is useful, and 13 of them said they're prepared to commit. 

00:43:35
Methodology - 1 

00:43:35
NARRATOR Alright. So, um, what do I do with them? Now so, each time when they come, I do a sort of warming up with them, and in the warming up, uh, we do some chanting, we do how are you, what have you eaten and that sort of thing. All right, then they'll describe to me what has happened. So, it's just a warm up. 45 minutes of psycho-spiritual education. It can be Buddhism, it can be something on ethics or life itself, coaching, mentoring and whatever. Uh, it does not need to be strictly Buddhist, um, doctrines or Buddhist texts and so-forth. I'm at liberty to do anything. And, uh, 45 minutes of mental relaxation, then the other 15 minutes is the grounding where I bring them back to where they are. Otherwise, they're going to fall asleep. So, that will occupy, probably, the two hours. And occasionally I'll show a video somewhere about some topics, for interesting topics for them to view. 

00:44:45
Warming up exercises 

00:44:45
NARRATOR Uh so, in the warming up exercises they get some news about the outside world, the and sometimes they try to trick me in a sense that, uh, the newspaper that they get, a lot of places have been edited and blanked off, over here, there, and they'll ask me, do you know what happened to this thing, and I don't know it has been blacked off, and I will tell them what happened. They'll say oh, now we know, you know. So, they want some news. So, they are quite anxious for news, and the news that they get is not the best, quite recent. They get just about a days old paper or two days old paper. They don't have access to TV, they don't watch the news. Uh, we do some joking here and there, and uh, some general conversation to just to ease them with this group. Um, I say sometimes the group is intact sometimes there's 14 of them. Sometimes there's eight and I have to ask where is the others, and they'll say oh, this guy has transferred to here, that guy has gone to do something else, that guy has gone to do the laundry and so forth. 

00:45:55
Psycho-spiritual education - 1 

00:45:55
NARRATOR Now so under psycho-spiritual education, we do Buddhist topics about science, the human body, developmental growth, emotion, behavior, personality, end of life, after life issues, I would discuss with them and ask them questions. And surprisingly not many of them know, they just take life for granted that I'm here, my mother brought me here and my mother is responsible. And I got to, I ask the same question I ask everyone there, that what do you think, is it, do you choose your parents or do your parents choose you? Which came first, the chicken or the egg? You know, I mean, they can't answer. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? He is chicken, that is all. Anybody wants to attempt which came first, the chicken or the egg? Okay, who says the egg? Egg, egg, egg, no, you don't know. Okay, she doesn't think. Okay, who says it's the chicken that came first? One, two, no, the chicken or the egg, which came first? No idea? Buddhism says the egg came first before the chicken, because every egg is different genetically, alright? So, is chicken that hatched into a chicken, it is different from the other chicken. By the same token, you choose your parents or do your parents choose you? No, it's my father and mother that one night they had a good time and nine months later I came and they never asked my permission, and I am here, and sitting in prison is all their fault. They all say that, blame the government, they blame their parents, they blame their wife, they blame everybody, but they don't blame themselves. Okay, then they ask me what's the answer, who chooses who then? You're all adults, I'll give you the answer, and this is one technique where I used to do with adolescents. Um, I said yes, it's true, your father and your mother had a good time one night, your father may be drunk or what, or your mother may be under drugs, but it doesn't matter, they had a good time one night. And then you know what, after your father discharge, there are millions of these crawling little crawling up the Fallopian tube. And I say look here, you are the hero that meets the egg first. You are the one that said I want to go, the gung ho guy, go on. And you are the one that met the egg. If you're the second guy and he were to hit the egg first, I wouldn't be talking to you. You wouldn't be here at all. Is that correct? Yeah. You wouldn't be here. I mean, I don't know where, but you might be in Mars or the Moon or somewhere else, but I wouldn't be talking to you, and you can see that I'm not in prison, I'm not here anymore. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:49:15
NARRATOR We're heroes that swim and swim and swim faster and faster boom, okay. Then out you are, you're there and here, and that's that. If, you know, just before the other guy gets in, then I wouldn't be talking to Richard here. Isn't it? So why are you blaming everybody else except yourself? You choose to be here. Then, that will carry on about respect for mothers, about what the Buddha said about mothers that, you know, how your mother has suffered nine months with you inside. Yeah. And so on, then. Then they start to think a little bit, alright. And this is the scientific part. Then, when I show them and say, um, the videos of, um, this conception of the birth, I show them a video of death, then their eyes will open up and say this is never up to them about dying. Some of the gangsters, they don't care, life, what is life, die die. I say fine, die die, it's okay, you don't cause any problem. But the problem is you don't die, then there's a lot of problems. If I say you're paralyzed or you got one hand chopped off and all that, then you know, big problems. People need to look after you, okay. Now, social issues, things like ethics, law, society, stigmatization, community and so forth. Now, stigmatization, famous question, when I'm applying for a job, do I tell my boss that I was in prison or do I just keep quiet? I said that depends, yeah? I mean, if you're going to get employed as a security guard and you've been in prison for robbery, then I think it better not to tell your boss, because I don't think he's going to employ you. But, we do get people who have been, uh, in jail for, for theft and for robbery and for, you know, house breaking and all that, applying for jobs to be security guard in the housing estate, in the condominium, and when they get rejected, he finds the member of parliament, bangs the table and says look here, I've served my term, I've served my time, I'm a Singapore citizen, I've voted for you, now you get me a job. So, member of parliament don't know what to do. Now so, that becomes a tricky question, yeah. Should you or should you not tell your prospective employer, and sometimes I tell them it depends on where you're working. If it's a small company, maybe you should contact your boss. If it's a large company, you may have to tell, and if it's a large organization like Singapore Airlines and all that, I think you have to tell, it's up to them. They may give you some job that is not related to your crime and all that. I mean, of course, Singapore Airlines is not going to employ somebody for their accounts department if you have been sent to jail for criminal breach of fraud or forgery or bank documents and all that. Now, in the personal development character building, team work, cooperative alliances and so forth. But this part is, um, again, a bit tricky. I don't do so much about team work and all that because you know, I don't think it works there. There was some occasions when I asked, you know, to organize things like you know, about friendship and bonding and team work, and uh, you know, there was one exercise where I was asked to do, you've got all these prisoners and we pair them off two of you, two of you, and prisoners male prisoners, uh, Malay, Chinese or whatever it is. So, just pair them off, give them a piece of newspaper, put the newspaper on the floor, okay, both of you got to step onto the newspaper, fine, they step. Then, after that, you get them to fold it in half, get them to step, and get them to put it into quarters, you get them to step. And time a will come when the newspaper is so small that they've got to step on each others toes. I mean, one's got to step on the foot of the other person and they've got to hug each other, and you know, it's not easy to get Chinese, Malay to hug an Indian or an Indian, no. So, I'm in the lesson, supposed to be. I'm in cooperative alliances, friendship, yeah. Yeah, they all laughed, all had fun, friends and all that, but after that no. When you did the break off, you get the sense that it's not gonna work. It's just for fun that they're doing it, but as far as the present, okay, one job done. They've gone through this. When they get out, they're not going to do such a thing. 

00:54:35
Psycho-spiritual education - 2 

00:54:35
NARRATOR Alright. So, sometimes I got to explain to them things like fatalism, predestination versus predetermination. I've got to tell them your life is not fatally stated, your life is not, uh, predestined, although it is predetermined. And we are being predetermined by our genes and our environment, okay. Then I have to explain to them a little bit. So, this is the education part we go through. And then sometimes after the education part I'll get them to think about during the time when they're relaxed or, I use that as an object of the meditation. Because we just cannot close our eyes, be peaceful and radiate love and kindness to everybody when they hit everybody. Okay. The acceptance of living and dying, and these are usually being appreciated by the older people. If death, doesn't occur to them. They've been living such a wanton life that, you know, death is just a process. I say fine, you know, many of them will tell me why worry when I die, close my eyes. I say fine, when you die you close your eyes, but your brain is still functioning. Is it? I say yeah. Your brain is the last to die, isn't it? The last organ to die. The other organs shut off first, and trying to preserve the brain and all the blood will go up to the brain to try to preserve the brain and it's the last to die. How long, how long? I say well, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, depending on the structure. You mean I'm dead but I'm still thinking? I say yeah, you're dead but you're still thinking. How can I be thinking if I'm dead? I say why don't you talk to your brain and ask him the same question?No, then you get them thinking a little bit. But this body of mine is, you know, is something that is precious, but when they are gangsters, they don't think the body, they think of doing heroic things, they think of no, fighting and killing or whatever it is that all romantic stories about China, about the the Kung-fu fighters and all that. No. Okay. Moment to moment enrichment, that is far reaching in the sense that during the relaxation process, I get into a body scan. So, then now when they begin to know yes, no, I've got a toe, I'm aware of my toe and my toe is part of me. Alright. Yeah, my hair is part of me, alright. We go through that process, then they begin to be aware. Now, hopefully, once they're aware of the body, the self, hopefully they will appreciate their body, and hopefully they will appreciate this, you know, thing that these two hands and one head and two eyes and when they get out, you know, they can at least be a little bit more thinking and say I have this body, my mother has that body, my wife has the body, and these we can jolt them to some sense of, um, you know, respect for other people. Okay. Now so, uh, the process is to try to get them to identify, identify their whole self to a new identity, the process of meditative transformation. So, hopefully I was thinking that within the 16 weeks, I could at least transform them a little bit, um, emotionally, mentally, and I think really important, spiritually. Uh, because all those people they lack the spirituality, and I think spirituality is a very important component of our daily living, of our life. 

00:58:40
Psycho-spiritual education - 3 

00:58:40
NARRATOR Now, so at the same time, I will try to integrate traditional spiritual beliefs to various aspects modem sciences so not to bore them, because if I keep talking about Buddhism and Buddhism and Buddhism, there's, they ask me to shut up, yeah. Because, um, you know, we can't, such an interesting subject, to them. And, uh, and the thing the good thing is that sometimes they will ask me a comparison between the, what is Buddhism and what is Islam and what is Hinduism and all that. Now, Islam I don't know so much, okay, but eternity, okay, I was brought up, I had my formal education in a Roman Catholic school, so I did my Bible studies, I passed my Bible exams and whatever. So, I'm quite okay. Hinduism is quite near Buddhism, so it's okay, I could talk about it, but Islam not so much. And lucky thing, the group there, there's no Muslim at all. I realized I would have to be very very careful of what you say because they are very sensitive to words, and you say the wrong thing, they'll cry jihad. 

00:59:55
Meditation - 1 

00:59:55
NARRATOR Now, so, in the meditation part, we have, I have the affirmation about the topic, then eliciting the body direction response and the body scan and mindfulness and observation on the topic. So, this is a process I do through, with them. I may skip a little bit, but basically, in that order. Um, affirmation, I think affirmation is very powerful, uh, you know, sentence where you affirm to yourself that you want to do a certain thing. So, I will ask them probably what is that affirmation that you want. I want to be good, I want to change, many of them say I want to change. So, okay, we start off by repeating okay, I want to change. I will change, I am changing, I changed. Okay. I want a better life, I am having a better life, I have a better life. Better life is just me. Okay. We go through that, okay. So, every week they will affirm that the same thing again and again so as it gets embedded into the subconscious. But of course, some come with a sense that I want to make money at the casino, okay, so hold on, no. What's wrong, making money in casino is legal making money in a casino. What's wrong with that? You make money in the casino, I'm wealthy through the casino, I'm right through casino. I say hang on, this is... 

01:01:40
Meditation - 2 

01:01:45
NARRATOR Then after that, we choose a topic, usually in meditation, we need to have an object of meditation, and I usually, uh, in traditional Buddhist practice, we use the breath, but in my workshop tomorrow, I will give you more than that. There are actually 14 objects on meditation that was taught by the Buddha himself. So, breathing is convenient because breathing is portable, breath is portable. Uh, there's no training, you, I need not teach you how to breath, because you breath. It's free of charge, and it can be done anywhere. Alright. But, if you want to meditate using a, dead corpse, then you've got to find a dead body somewhere to put there in front of you to meditate. And it's not easy to get, find a dead corpse in Brisbane. I can do it in Singapore. I mean, I can go to the Singapore general hospital and say look here, I need to meditate, can I have that corpse. I can do that. So, uh, but tomorrow I might show you the corpse where, um, the useful meditation in Sri Lanka with a real dead body where they slice open and you meditate on the lungs, the spleen, the intestine and that sort of thing. You can see blood all over, and it's gruesome, but it reminds one that our body is perishable. Uh, eliciting the response that is important. I think, you know, in our body, our central nervous system, we've got two other system, that is the autonomous nervous system and your, your motor nervous system, your sensory and your motor nervous system. Now, and both system try to reach the state of equilibrium so that we are we can behave and we can function normally. Alright. Now, what happens sometimes if we're in a state of anxiety and stress and all that, our, the sympathetic nervous system becomes more active, okay, and then we secrete things like adrenaline, you know, the body rush where we're going to the fight or flight sort of, you know, state. Okay. But at the same time, our nervous system is trying to balance this out by secreting dopamine and endorphins, trying to cool us down. Okay. Uh, now, people like Herbert Spencer and Andrew Weir have found that relaxation response is actually the opposite of the fight or flight response, uh, so when this is being elicited, the relaxation response, what they found is that, after the studies in I think Harvard or Yale, that things like our body temperature begins to drop, our heart rate begins to drop, our body, metabolic rate drops also, pressure drops also. So, it is a therapeutic sort of, uh, result when we do this relaxation response technique, yeah. And it's not a hard thing to do, just part of meditation where lots of, uh, psychiatrists and psychologists, before they start the treatment, try to get the client or the patient to relax, and uh, they go through this process also. Uh, then I will do the body scan from the toes to the hands to the hair and whatever organs you have, and then to be mindful of certain thing. So, this is the process that is being done every week. When it comes to choosing a topic, I mentioned just now in Buddhist meditation methodology, there are 40 meditative topics that can be chosen, and usually we use the in and out breath which is known as the anapanasatti, okay. Now, anapanasatti means satti is a Pali word for discourse, and anapana means in out breathing. So, it is taken from the Buddhist context it is the discourse, the Buddha's discourse on in out breathing. And, uh, okay. That is the discourse. So, usually Buddhists tend to focus on that. 

01:06:20
Meditation - 3 

01:06:20
NARRATOR Now, focusing on the whole body and relating to the body subtle energies is kayapunasana. Kaya means body, anupasana means mindfulness on the body. Focusing on body feeling sensation and so forth is vedanupasana. Vedanu means feelings, but not emotions, and, uh, this mindfulness on feelings. Focusing on thought is citanupasana and focusing on the meaning of life and life process is dhammanupasana. So you see, the process of, of meditation itself is, um, is quite a deep process. It goes through by seven stages. First, you get them to focus on the body. Then, you get them to focus, to be mindful of the feelings, then you get them to be mindful of, uh, the thought process, the thinking process, their inner thought, the internal verbalization. And then you will get them to focus on life, life's meaning, life events and so forth. So, there's this very stages it goes through. And it's quite a lengthy process. 

01:07:30
Meditation - 4 

01:07:30
NARRATOR Now, so that methodology is taken from this course called a Satipathana sutta. It is the discourse on the foundation of mindfulness. I have in my notes all sort of there, so if you want you can, you know, just Google into this this course and find out more about them. Now, the primary technique in meditative practice is focusing, concentrating, noting, being mindful and creativity. That is the enlightenment, yeah. Uh, I have no time to discuss with you about the meaning of enlightenment as against the meaning of, uh, the highest bliss the nirvana. Tomorrow I will discuss, because many people confuse these two concepts. Uh, the second technique is that of reflecting, the cultivation of wisdom. 

01:08:25
Meditation - 5 

01:08:25
NARRATOR Because, uh, Buddhism meditation techniques, they are quite structures, so we know what we're doing and then, uh, again in, uh, Buddhist meditation techniques, there are many pitfalls and there are many dangers which are not usually being told to you all. But again, tomorrow I will discuss that with, in this, in the workshop that I'm doing tomorrow. Alright, uh, and if one is not careful, one could get into depression, into a neurotic state or psychotic state, or so. Because you know, um, it is good to know that one day you are going to die, accept that, right? But we know that at an intellectual level, but during meditation, you are supposed to enter an experiential level, that means you're supposed to experience death, you're supposed to create a situation of dying, and once, if the person could get into that experiential state, it can become quite frightening. Then you begin to ask the meaning of your own life, you ask the meaning of your relationship with your spouse, with your children, with your dad, your cat, your whatever it is. It can, so not many people are prepared to go to that level. Uh, it is secular in approach, uh, okay. 

01:09:55
Meditation - 6 

01:09:55
NARRATOR Now, the focus meditative method in this program is called samatha tranquility meditation, and there's another called vipassana, So actually, Buddhist meditation is only two types, samatha and vipassana. That is all. But today, there's so many things and you know, is being marketed and redressed and whatever, that people begin to distract. So, uh, again, tomorrow I'm trying to get back to track and look upon meditation as sort of a spiritual path rather than a therapy or a secular path. 

01:10:25
Meditation - 7 

01:10:30
NARRATOR So, uh, vipassana is a bit more serious. It, uh, involves very large topics about life itself, about meaning and about self, about your permanence, and this is the book that is being referred to, the Visuddhi Magga, the Path of Purification by Buddhagosha, a fifth century monk, he wrote this book. It's about 1000 pages, so it details all the processes of meditative techniques. Uh, on this vipasana meditation. But again, if you Google or go to Yahoo, and you click vipasana, you'll find thousands of vipasana centers all over the world trying to teach vipasana meditation. But they're not the traditional Buddhist way. 

01:11:20
Grounding - 1 

01:11:25
NARRATOR Okay. And, uh, grounding is to get them back to the, the present moment, either rubbing their palms, forearms and face. They do some stretching and some bending exercises. Because, uh, sitting down is not so bad, but if you are sitting on the floor, uh, usually I will go through with you all after that to stand and do some exercises to, to get your back bone, you know, stretched. 

01:11:55
Summarising and discussion 

01:11:55
NARRATOR Then we, after we share experience, and some say they will share their experience and you know, I was very relaxed and thought of my mother, I thought of my father, and then some become very reflective. Some of them say I fell asleep and whatever. 

01:12:10
Discussions - Some pitfalls and dangers 

01:12:10
NARRATOR So, some of the pitfalls and dangers are that sometimes when we talk to them, I talk to them, they say they get back aches, stiff necks, visions and sounds. Visions of color lights and sounds is possible, uh, in Buddhism we call it mimitas. So, uh, you're expected to see lights and colors and vision, but you will have to explain it to what that means than. Uh, you're not getting, uh, you're not a schizo, although if, if, uh, some people report that I see lights and colors and sounds and all that, they'll probably bring you to the mental hospital and refer you to a schizo. But in the Buddhist context it's not. I mean, it's part of the process of meditation, so don't be frightened. So, sometimes you get evocation of past memories, emotional, experiencing emotional upheavals, fear, indecisiveness and disenchantment. And this is the danger, disenchantment as to life itself. Alright. You know, some of them ask me, they say look here, if you say everything is impermanent, so why worry, then? When I get out, I rob a bank and I come in again, that's all. You see the negative part of it in their thinking, but we'll do some recorrection. 

01:13:30
Difficulties encountered by inmates 

01:13:35
NARRATOR Now uh, difficulties encountered by inmates is that sharing cells with those not sympathetic to what they're doing. I told you sometimes they make noise and talk loudly and so forth. You've got noise, disturbances created by cell mates, not conducive cell temperature, and you know cells are not air conditioned or they've got no temperature control. If it's hot, it's hot, if it's cold, it's very cold. And, uh, you know that is because it's all bricks. Uh, not sufficiently disciplined, many of them are lazy also. Doubts on the efficacies of meditation and they want immediate benefits. It's tough, even in counseling, I think you know, isn't it? Many of your clients, I've got clients coming in can you finish in one session or not? Deep marital issues, husband and wife are about to divorce, they expect to be cured in one session. I say look here, you've been living with this problem for the last 20 years, now you want me to cure you in one session? You'll be lucky if I can do it in 30 years. They're oh, then they (inaudible ). 

01:14:40
[sil.] 

01:14:40
Cultivations of the Preliminaries - 1 

01:14:40
NARRATOR So, the inmates advised of the importance of cultivation and radiation of preliminaries to oneself and to others. And I will tell them, I'll go through with them things like forgiveness, love, intention and compassion. I put forgiveness first because there is something in Buddhism which is not in Buddhism itself, but I put it in. Buddhism, um, asks us to practice the radiation of love and kindness, radiate love to everybody, radiate love to all humans, sentient beings, from the cockroaches to the lizards to the everybody. Okay, fine. But how can one radiate love when one hasn't learned how to forgive yet? So, I think forgiveness is more, is more important. Once you forgive, that love will automatically regenerate internally. So, here for the prisoners, I think forgiveness is important because they blame everybody. They blame the police for arresting them, they blame their friends for bringing them to a drug party, they blame, you know. So, and the thing is that I've, I will teach them how to forgive themselves also. I think you've been fine, don't live that mistake. All right, forgive yourself. 

01:15:55
Findings of intake 5 

01:16:00
NARRATOR Now, uh, intake number five, [the course ended at December 2012. 01:16:10]So, these are the results, it's all inside there. I've got only five minutes left, the results are there. 

01:16:15
Finding of intake 6 

01:16:15
NARRATOR Finding of intake number six, the results are there. 50 percent mentioned visual mimitas. These are sounds and all that, which is interesting.

01:16:30
Verbal reporting by intake 6 

01:16:30
NARRATOR Uh, intake number six, one inmate reported he was aware that a few others who were not present did meditate because a couple of people were absent. Two inmates were of the opinion that they felt those not present had benefited from meditating regularly. So, they are positive results, but the results aren't, it's not collective but more individualized.

Unofficial comments by prison authorities

NARRATOR Uh, now, the unofficial comments by the prison authorities is that the fact that the program had run for six intakes, meaning about two, four, six, about three years, means it's quite successful. And, uh, they will arrange for a similar program which now I'm having the seventh intake now. Uh, they say that inmates are better behaved. They're not rude anymore, they've become a little bit more disciplined and they think a little bit more. Inmates showed behavioral changes as the course progresses. So these are, you know when I meet the officers there and ask how is this guy, he's much better now. How's that guy? His temper has gone down. Okay, um, thank you and that's all

NARRATOR Uh, relax, sit down and place your feet firmly on the ground, and your two hands on your lap, okay, facing downward and close your eyes. Relax, breathe in and breathe out. Take a deep breath in, into the belly and not into the chest, and as you exhale, you can exhale through the mouth in a form of a sigh. And as you exhale, relax your shoulders, your abdominal muscles, behind the ears, your neck, behind the neck. Breathe in and breathe out. Breathe in and breathe out. Feel relaxed. Feel as though you are butter melting into the chair. You're very soft, you're very calm, you're very serene. Be comfortable. Breathe in and breathe out. Now, place your focus on to your left foot. Focus onto your big toe, second toe, third, fourth and your little toe. You might feel some tingling sensation, these are your muscles relaxing. Go to the sole of your feet, your heels, up your left leg to the shins, the knees, your thigh, and your left hips. Then move your focus to your abdomen. Feel the rise and fall of your abdomen, breathe in and breathe out. Breathe in and breathe out. Now, move to your right leg. Again, place your attention onto your big toe, your second, third, fourth and your little toe. Again, you may feel the sensation some tingling, or feel the sensation of your toes against your shoes, the leather of your shoe. Move to your ankle, your shins, your calf. Move further up to your knees, your thighs your right hip bones and once again feel the rise and fall of your abdomen. Breathe in and breathe out. Breathe in and breathe out. Move to your left hand, focus on your thumb and your second finger, third finger, fourth finger and your little finger. Once again, you might feel the thumb tingling on the tips of your finger, some sensation. Focus on your palm, behind the palm, your wrist, forearm, elbow, bicep, left shoulder, and move down your left chest and once again focus on the rise and fall of your abdomen. Breathe in and breathe out. Breathe in and breathe out. Move to your right hand. Again, focus on your thumb, your second finger, the third finger, fourth finger, and little finger. Your palm, behind the palm, your wrist, forearms, elbow, bicep, shoulder. Move down the right shoulder and again down to your abdominal region. Feel the rise and fall of your abdomen once again. Breathe in and breathe out. We are relaxed.

NARRATOR Now, move to the top of your head. Feel your hair, the roots of your hair, go down into the scalp, go down into your brain. The brain which is behind your two eyeballs. Feel the sensation of your brain, the center part of your brain. Move to your forehead, relax your forehead. Relax your eyebrow. Focus onto your eyes, your eyeballs, behind the eyeball, your retina. Feel your nose, behind the bridge of your nose, feel your nose, then once again, feel your breath your in and out breath. Focus your breath and your breathing. If it is long breath, then say to yourself long breath. If it is short breath, then say to yourself short breath. If it is heavy breath, then say to yourself heavy breath. If it is light breath, say to yourself light breath. If it fast, then say it to yourself fast breath. If it is slow, then say it to yourself slow breath. Notice your breathing and notice the air that pulls through your nostril. You can feel that as your air, as you breathe in, it will be cooler than the air that you exhale. Just notice. Just notice. Now move to your cheeks, relax your cheeks, your lips, your chin, down the throat, your chest. And once again, be conscious of the rise and fall of your abdomen. Move to the back of your head. And relax your neck, behind the neck, behind your two ears, your shoulders, your left shoulder and your right shoulder, down the spinal chord, down to your stomach, your liver, your kidneys, down to the down to the tail bone, and once again focus on the rise and fall of your abdomen. Breathe in and breathe out. Breathe in and breathe out. You're totally relaxed, you're totally at ease with yourself. All the tensions and all the anxieties are no longer with you. You are you, and there is no one else but you. Breathe in, breathe out. Appreciate yourself and love yourself, because you are you. Breathe in and breathe out. Your whole body is now vibrating in unison, your whole body, your whole body, your vibration, your energy is now one with the cosmic energy and the cosmic vibration. You are a part of the cosmic vibrations, you are part of the whole being of existence, so be at ease with yourself, relax, be tranquil and be calm, and join the forces of the universe, breathe in and breathe out. Be silent, be quiet, feel the sensation of the whole body, the whole body, the whole body.
