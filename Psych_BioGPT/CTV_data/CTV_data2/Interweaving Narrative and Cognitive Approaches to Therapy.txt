gathering for developing 

00:00:05
constructive narratives. 

00:00:05
RICHARD COOK So I'm hoping that during this next hour-and-a-half we can do some things, where you can work in threes and talk a little bit about some of the -- some of the work that you do and hopefully make some connections with -- with this topic. 

00:00:25
Background 

00:00:25
BTI in Tauranga, 

00:00:25
New Zealand 

00:00:25
CBT + narrative = confusion 

00:00:25
RICHARD COOK So if I can just introduce myself to you a little. Um, I'm from New Zealand, whether you can tell it when I say fish -- if I say fish 'n' chips, you'll definitely know where I come from. Although I have lived -- I did live in Australia for three years in my younger life. So I consider my second home. Um, I grew up in Hawke's Bay, which is a beautiful sunny spot and -- 

00:01:00
 (inaudible ) 

00:01:02
RICHARD COOK Yes, good wine, fruit. We seemed those contentious apples over to you that, now that Australian growers didn't want to have coming -- coming in from Hawke's Bay. And I've lived, as I said, in Australia and in Auckland and Rotorua, and so on. For the last 15 years, I've lived in Tauranga, which is just down the sweep of the coast from Auckland and the North Island. So a similar climate to -- um, to Melbourne, although we don't get the heat in the summer, but more temperate. And I've been there for 15 years working in the Counselor education program. So when I went to Bethlehem Tertiary Institute, which is the name of the Tertiary College where I work, they were just providing teacher education and my task was to start a counseling program. So we first franchised one from another provider and co-taught it and then I wrote the degree and diploma back, which we started in 2000 for the first year. And been going, in a sense, so having come from a life of moving around every couple of years, I've been in one place for 15, which, you know, stands everyone I know, who's used to twinking out my name and putting a new name and find over anywhere here. What it has given me the ability to do though is to -- is to develop something over a long period, you know, it's really satisfying to -- to -- to develop something and see it grow and change and then work with a team to evolve it and bring each person's gifts and -- and personalities and preferences to that and -- and produce something, it's a very creative, generative kind of process I found. But what I'd like to do in this workshop is share first of all some of the -- some of the headaches about one aspect of that, um, good natured though those headaches have been for us in the team. We -- we've joked with each other about the difficulties of teaching different modalities in a first degree and diploma, we don't teach two in the diploma, just one in the diploma, two in the degree. Um, so we have now a Bachelor of Counseling that's -- takes students, we teach about distance learning, as well as an on-site cohort. So we have students all over New Zealand, every nook and cranny and valley and snow-covered hill. We laughingly said, when we sit at up as a flexi program, we'll probably end out with students from Kaitaia to Gore. Well, Kaitaia is sort of, you know, the closest point to you guys and Gore is -- I don't know why anyone want to live there, it's you know kind of gray and white and cold and bleak. But we had students literally from Kaitaia to Gore, so we kind of right now. So we've -- we've -- we've had students from all over New Zealand and a few from Australia as well, who come over for our intenses.(ph) The um, -- so this workshop really is to talk about this --kind of this bit of a headache that we've had and where we've got to with it and then to interact with you a little bit, um, and I thought what we do is work in threes and talk about a piece of work with somebody and kind of try and grapple with these ideas and how would they relate to, um, a piece of work that you might be doing. So we'll get to that, but I'll just kind of work my way through these ideas and a bit of the story, tell you a bit of the story that's gone on along the way. So the two main aims really of this workshop, firstly, to survey this constructive narrative perspective on CBT, um, and that's kind of the results. That's -- I've almost -- almost told you the last chapter of the story before I've told you the first, but that -- kind of that's where we're hitting. So hopefully, you'll have a bit of a -- um, a grasp of that by the time we get to the end of this workshop. And to experience the use of particularly hinge questions and data gathering for developing constructive narratives. And again, hopefully, that we'll make -- but more things by the end of this workshop. Um, as we go along, if you find the temperature as I did even coming from New Zealand was slightly chilly this morning. Um, just go and see the guy at back and have it adjusted it because it's nothing worse then either being too warm that you're drifting off to sleep or feel like you've actually been transported to New Zealand without your consent. 

00:06:30
The impact of moving from learning 

00:06:30
CBT to learning Narrative 

00:06:30
...I tend to see CBT as a formula-based therapy e.g. 

00:06:30
ABC. Conversely I would refer to Narrative as an art. 

00:06:30
In the classroom I have put CBT consciously 

00:06:30
aside...however, in the counseling room when I have 

00:06:30
got stuck I am very tempted to revert to CBT. 

00:06:30
...I struggled with CBT: it didn't fit for me... 

00:06:30
...I feel more confident but now I'm wanting to shed 

00:06:30
CBT so I can become more proficient in Narrative. 

00:06:30
RICHARD COOK So this -- this is our little institute. We are -- we have about 500 students, half of them would be distance learners around the country and the other half on-site cohorts that spread across primary, early childhood and secondary teacher education, counselor education and next year, we've just got approval, my project for the year has been to write the social work degree. And we've just got approval just this last week, so it's going to, fhew, -- that's a new venture for us, which we're very excited about. So that's -- that was dangling, it wasn't me, but someone dangling out of the helicopter obviously, otherwise it'll be a very tall tree over hanging out properly. But let's see our little place and it's in Tauranga, as I said. Some people say Taulonga, but correctly pronounced in Maori as Toeronga, like Toeronga, like a toe and then move on that. 

00:07:40
The problem of integrating 

00:07:40
cognitive & narrative approaches 

00:07:40
View of 

00:07:40
Counselling 

00:07:40
View of People, 

00:07:40
Problems & Progress 

00:07:40
Worldview 

00:07:40
RICHARD COOK And I'd like to talk now about this CBT and narrative confusion or headache that presented itself to us. So what happened was, when we franchise the first diploma from another institute, it had within it a large proportion of CBT teaching, which I had done some training in, but not a lot and I -- I had done my master's in narrative therapy, master's in counseling at Waikato University. So I was, you know, gung ho, passionate about narrative ideas and practices. So as the -- as we took on this diploma, we kind of -- we only taught it for three years in the end, but we managed to get some approval to -- to bring in narrative as well and -- but the steering grip for this -- a lot who worked with me were dead keen that we kept CBT and -- and I could see reasons for that, still in New Zealand a very -- you know, it's a kind of a therapy of choice. A lot of people speak very highly of it and want -- want people who are trained in CBT. So we keep it through the end, that was kind of -- they were just uneasy bid fellows really, we recruited the second team member and he and I wrote the degree that we then got approved and he come from quite a strong CBT background. So, of course, he wanted that to stay in the degree and I really wanted, you know, to see the narrative perspective in the degree and we didn't want to -- well, we couldn't get approval just to teach one approach anyway. And we didn't want to teach a plethora because in the first qualification, we felt and the consultation suggests that people needed an idea of how to work coherently and something that would guide a consistent sort of approached practice. Um, so we ended up saying, okay, we'll -- we'll give a survey of models and then we'll do CBT. We'll do (inaudible ) or core skills a new one and on that foundation we'll build cognitive behavioral expressions in year two and then narrative in year three. And as we -- as we grew and more students and more staff came and we used to have these kind of, you know, poke in the ribs jokes with each other about. Ah, well, it just gives you a -- you're so cognitive and all, you just stole into stories and this kind bent too we go backwards and forwards and it was all good natured. But what started to emerge was for -- our students was some kind of brain shift thing that happened when they moved from year two to year three. And one of them described it as being that they would hook on the CBT trailer in year two. They'd get into year three and start learning about narrative, had no way of stacking it in the same trailer. So they would unhook that trailer, drive up and then hook on the CBT -- the narrative trailer and then drive off and do their practice. How are we going like? What are we doing? You know, this is a whole year of learning and experience and putting things into practice that they just unhooking, leaving it on the side of the road, hook in on this other one and it just didn't seem -- it just didn't seem very good educationally and didn't seem good use of their time and money really. So we started, we did a bit of research on this and we got a group of the year threes who were willing to be participants and one of us sat out and didn't teach that course and we ran surveys and focus groups during the -- at the end of the year based on their experience. And interestingly, they see these kind of things. It is the impact of moving from CBT in year two to learning narrative, they'd see -- these are quotes. I tend to see CBT as a formula-based therapy AG, ABC or ABCDE. And conversely, I would refer to narrative as an art. Well, as Richard would say this from this morning's workshop that's very interesting. Um, you know, in what way is the CBT not an art. In what ways is listening as C. S. Lewis said um, you know, listening is an art, not a science. You know, in what ways the CBT not, but this was the kind of -- this was the impression of it. And obviously, in the classroom, I've put CBT consciously aside, however, in the counseling room when I have got stuck, I'm very tempted to revert to CBT. So there's this strong kind of dichotomy was there between these two approaches and not surprising in some ways. More than one, because these kind of words, I'm -- I struggled with CBT, it didn't fit for me. And what we -- what we found anecdotally was that students who like structure, like -- like clear delineated process, they liked CBT. They tend to be happier using CBT because they could boil it down to, you know, the process steps that you could follow through and even though we didn't teach it particularly, clinically, it was still -- they -- they still would prefer that, whereas those who are more -- they used to say I was very wooly and fluffy and blah-di-blah. The people who like story or -- went so much in structure, they liked the kind of exploratory nature narrative. But this kind of seemed to create a language of dichotomy even as the students talked about it. So they would kind of talk and position themselves in one or other of these camps. And so it's kind of accentuated this -- the difference. So another piece of feedback, well, as I feel more confident, but now I'm wanting to shed CBT. So I can become more professioned to narrative. What we've noticed in the final assessments is that -- that students who were -- who liked to integrate, who liked to put things together, they had actually gone a long way towards finding the -- for example, they could do a CBT exploration with a client, but they could then look for exceptions. So they could borrow the unique outcome or sparkling moment idea from narrative therapy and they could weave it in, look for exceptions and then see what was happening in the exceptions. They were integrating to some degree, but by and large it wasn't a headwind. And so we had this ongoing kind of sense of that we went really serving them as well as we could. In the mid-90s, it was the wearisome attempts people like Ramzi and Russ and Gonzalez and so on, Goncalves and others kind of came up with these ideas about how to integrate the emerging kind of narrative psychology, constructivist ideas with CBT. 

00:15:40
The centrepiece - a post-rationalist 

00:15:40
constructivist view of people, 

00:15:40
problems & progress 

00:15:40
Bruner: narrative & paradigmatic construction 

00:15:40
Narratives = linked events across time that form into 

00:15:40
a meaning-filled plot or storyline 

00:15:40
Paradigmatic = propositions or beliefs about self, 

00:15:40
identity and the world are concluded 

00:15:40
RICHARD COOK But as Bob Neimeyer pointed out in '93, you can't just say, I'm going to take a bit from here and a bit from there and call it a therapeutic approach, because they are sitting on such different philosophical bases. And he really put the challenge out there in the literature. And so we -- we've always been guided by this little model that Crabb developed that any view of counseling, any counseling process, Gestalt or Rogerian or CBT, that view of counselings, perhaps it always fits on a view of people, problems and progress. So CBT has a clear view of people as kind of coming to beliefs or conclusions, inferences that problems develop when those are self-defeating, toxic some would say or unhelpful and the progress is achieved by modifying those or reconstructing those beliefs. I mean that's a CBT view of people, problems and progress. Narrative therapy rests on a different view of people, problems and progress. It sees people as within a social context and that the social environment is, that problem is within the discourse or within the -- the language and meaning, systems within or language and meaning flow within the social environment that somebody lives within. And therefore, it kind of gets absorbed or -- did you ever have that ad here? In fact, I think it might have been an Australian ad about the -- for fluoride toothpaste and the woman with kids and she dips the chalk and then kind of, it does get in. Did you hear that? 

00:17:55
 Yes. 

00:17:55
RICHARD COOK I thought it sounded like an Australian accent. Well, that's a bit like the idea of narrative that -- that -- that these meanings and these things that are in the social environment get in and become -- become incorporated so that we become uses of the discourse, that the meanings of social stories if you like. So problems arise when problematic and -- problematic, messages and meanings and stories within society get absorbed and taken on and taken in to the personal in relationships that, that personalism. And progress then is about finding preferred stories, preferred identity, meanings and places to stand. But Crabb went further and said that any view of people, problems and progress rests on a world view or view of the world. And of course, CBT originally was built on a pretty modernist view of the world. Fairly, you know, scientific and it's kind of structuralist view, rationalist view of the world and how people tick and how knowledges formed and kind of the truths about the world. Whereas narrative therapy is built, you know, very clearly on a post-modernist, post-structuralist, almost -- almost anti-positivist kind of base. So in other words, it's kind of looked sideways at -- at the kind of the normative or norm -- the way that psychology and science says this is normal and we can know things. And so nature therapy, view of people, problems and progress is based on a incredibly different pedestal to traditional CBT. And that's what Neimeyer I think was -- well -- well, I'm pretty sure that's what he was meaning when he said he can't just say, well, I really like these narrative ideas. I'm going to pick them up off that -- that little tower over there and I'm going to put them over here and put them alongside my CBT bits, so I'm going to mix and match the bits that I like, but it actually isn't that what most of us do. Multi-model, I was going to say, multi-model. What you said? 

00:20:30
 Multi-model. 

00:20:30
RICHARD COOK Multi-model. 

00:20:30
 Multi-model. 

00:20:30
RICHARD COOK  Yeah, that too. Multi-mingle. And I read a study last year that said something, I think, it was of the order of 75 to 80, somewhere in the percentage of practitioners interviewed three years or more after graduation had what would be described as an integrative -- integrated or integrative approach to practice that they mean mix that. No, I don't think so. I think most of us actually, we've been out here for a while working, don't we? We -- we -- we go to a seminar, we go to a workshop, we learn something and we -- we find a way or we see where it makes connections and we bring it in. And I think that's what -- you know, I think that study was probably represented colleagues of mine. That would be true. What I think Neimeyer was saying is it when you go to teach something new to somebody, it's much more difficult to do it if you're picking a piece from here, a piece from there and trying to put it together. If you haven't built a clear view of people and a clear world view to sit it on that the -- the beginning practitioner can't have the confidence of what they're standing on, a bit like people in cross-stitch, this last year have not been able to have confidence on the land they're standing on because it keeps literally moving. And I think that's what he's saying that when you present a new -- when people are learning it for the first time and they need a clear, coherent, philosophical base from which to practice. Hence the kind of hit that we had. 

00:22:30

00:22:40
Bruner: "cultural products" 

00:22:40
The building blocks of narratives: "We gain 

00:22:40
the self-told narratives that make and 

00:22:40
remake ourselves from the culture in 

00:22:40
which we live. We are virtually, from the 

00:22:40
start, expressions of the culture that 

00:22:40
nurtures us," (Bruner, 2004b, p.13) 

00:22:40
Harré: the "public mind" 

00:22:40
RICHARD COOK So we've been doing some kind of thinking and lot of rating and it seems that -- in fact, in the literature since the early '90s and as constructivism -- in other words this idea that as -- as human beings, social beings, we construct a sense of self in relationship with the social environment within which we live. Has -- has really taken off, hasn't it? I mean, it's taken off across so many fields of knowledge as far as I can tell. And an example that I use of this with our students is, I don't know how sturdy this is, but the question I would say is what you would you call this? 

00:23:40
 Table. 

00:23:40
RICHARD COOK  Well, what is this? 

00:23:45
 Table. 

00:23:45
RICHARD COOK Any other ideas? 

00:23:50
 Sofas. 

00:23:50
RICHARD COOK Sofas? 

00:23:50
 Desk. 

00:23:50
RICHARD COOK  Pardon. 

00:23:55
 Desk. 

00:23:55
RICHARD COOK Desk. 

00:23:55
 Wooden bench. 

00:23:55
RICHARD COOK Bench. These are all English words. Are there any other language words out there? 

00:24:05
 Energy? 

00:24:05
RICHARD COOK Energy. Okay. Any other languages? 

00:24:10
[non-English narration] 

00:24:10
RICHARD COOK Thank you. 

00:24:10
[non-English narration] 

00:24:15
RICHARD COOK Thank you. Any others? 

00:24:20
[non-English narration] 

00:24:20
RICHARD COOK Okay. So there's a few. So for start, we don't have just -- even just one word, even in one language for this. Whatever this is. We have a whole range of words within one language and across a group of 40 odd people, we have a multitude of words from around the world, for what this is. So that's just the -- that's just the signifier or the label for this, before we even get to what this means or what this is or -- and one things I learned very early when I went to BTI is and I used to teach by sitting like this. It's only on this room you would find this a fin surf. Who would find this is a fin surf within your culture or whether just from what you've known, not many. 

00:25:20
 Yeah, I would. 

00:25:25
RICHARD COOK You would? 

00:25:25
 Disrespectful, disbelief. 

00:25:25
RICHARD COOK Disrespectful? 

00:25:25
 Yeah. 

00:25:25
RICHARD COOK To... 

00:25:30
 Sit there in that manner and respect people. 

00:25:30
RICHARD COOK Okay. So it's like -- like a -- it's disrespectful for the speaker to do that. 

00:25:35
 Yes. 

00:25:35
RICHARD COOK Okay. Like too relaxed or too -- not respecting you enough. 

00:25:40
 (inaudible ) our view in addressing us. 

00:25:45
RICHARD COOK Okay. 

00:25:45
 So to -- on pull I have to do these. 

00:25:50
RICHARD COOK Okay. 

00:25:50
 I don't really want to be here. 

00:25:50
RICHARD COOK So I kind of get to -- almost instead of a -- I don't really want to be here, sort of chilling out, I'm not kind of treating this -- this occasion with respect. Okay, and any other ideas about? Yeah. 

00:26:05
 It's disrespectful to the leads and practices with industry not continuing to -- you don't make some parts and food. Similarly, in multi-culture. 

00:26:15
RICHARD COOK I don't make some body parts and food. Similarly, in multi-culture. Yes, yes indeed. I mean I've grown up in New Zealand, but I didn't actually know that and I was 35 when I went to BTI. So I (inaudible ), I was sort of thinking I was just being relaxed and relational. And Marty, lovely gracious woman came up to me afterwards and she said, I know you're new here. But we don't sit on tables. And I went (inaudible ). That's interesting. What -- can you tell me, but why is that? She said, well, because it's tapu and noa. Tapu is something that's sacred or something that you would keep force, you know, it's -- it's -- it's a way of separating that which -- from that which is noa or common. And when surfaces that we eat on are common, they're shared by all the different people. And so you don't mix tapu and noa, you don't mix that, which is you need to keep separate, like bottoms from that which is shared for food. All right, I got it and I exit for this -- using this example. I've never sat on a table from that date, but it was a vivid memory. So what is this? So suddenly we have not just a range of labels, but we have constructed a whole range of words and meanings and usages and prohibitions, things that go to give and things that don't go to give, like there's whole raft of meanings, I don't be around -- around this. And for example, if you go into someone's office, uh, oh, and they're sitting like this. If you went into a counselor’s office, why don't we sit across like this? What is it about tables or desks? 

00:28:35
 Barriers put the relations right. 

00:28:35
RICHARD COOK Barriers speaks of. 

00:28:40
 Doctor. 

00:28:40
RICHARD COOK Doctor, power, authority, knowledge, differences, differential, that's constructivism. What we've just been doing is constructivism. We are -- we're d-constructing the power and the nature of the relationships that are constituted by the meanings in circulation and that's just around tables. Oh, what is it this is the tabular and all the other ways that we would describe this. I mean it really is interesting. I mean I think it's fascinating the way that meanings are constructed and passed on. But if we think about someone like Bruner. Jerome Bruner, the -- the extent and significance of his work on narrative and paradigmatic kind of memory in making sense of the world of construction. We -- we -- when we go on to this, we feel, yes, this could be the centerpiece for understand -- for bringing these two kind of ideas much -- these two ways of practicing much or is it a give up. So this idea that -- that narratives link events across time into a plot or a story, narratives -- what we do, we make sense of our experience by stories, by linking them. And this idea of -- seem to us to be a combination of the narrative focus on how the social world, the constructions and the social world influence individual meaning making, as well as the fact that there is some individual meaning making going on. There's some individual concluding or belief making. We're not just passively absorbing, but there is a -- there's a process. So it kind of gave us some -- some ideas. And this idea of Bruner's at this paradigmatic, there is propositions or beliefs about self, about identity kind of the stuff and the world, gender, relationships, these -- these individual stories are linked together into a para -- paradigmatic sense or knowledge of the world. Since I prepared this on PowerPoint, I have another one that is based on some work and a presentation that Joe Friedman did. Someone's got 19 new messages available too by the looks. I know who that is, but. So I -- I thought Joe's presentation was quite useful. So I've kind of adapted it to this -- to this -- to this workshop. If we think of each of these dots on here as a memory, an event, that our brain has somehow stored, however, that isn't, I'm more confused about that after this morning. Or not -- I'm actually not confused, I'm more fascinated by what all that's about. But let's just -- suffice it to say, obviously, we have these memories, these events that are stored. And so one event by itself, I mean my little fellow, my youngest. When he was only that, I don't know this high, so what would that be, three, four, I was cooking some tea and I remember he was behind me and I -- and I heard him, he was trying to do something and he yelled out, oh, I'm useless. I was just shocked because that is not something he would have heard from us because we were -- one of the things we tried to be very careful about, at least the words we use, probably the intimation and there was a noise, can't grow him with that. But those were not words he would have heard anyway. Now that's one event, he was doing something. That wasn't isolated, probably not, not given the fact that he went to a school and schooling is, you know, full of, you know, trying to achieve things and be evaluated and so on. And I know he struggled there. So he had one activating event if you like to use the CBT team and he remembered it. But I'm pretty sure that would be others and there are still others. And in Bruner's terms, this is narrative -- this is the narrative he would have had. Some of these memories and maybe that were conscious, explosive as Richard called it this morning or implosive. They may have been -- may have receded in terms of being consciously remembered. But he had some kind of -- this line is to represent that -- that there was some kind of belief formed or inference taken about himself. In CBT terms, we would call that a belief. But in constructivist terms, we would might say that -- that living in a world that values achievement and gives messages of ticks and crosses according to how well you do things. It's quite likely that this -- that these events in which he didn't -- wasn't able to do even what he wanted to be able to do, little line what teachers or others, an authority wanted him to do would reproduce the storyline of -- of something around not being good enough, not -- not achieving, not being useful -- as useful as possible. So it does get in, you know, and he had measured himself. We live in a measurement culture. I mean sitting in New Zealand, the whole educational process is obsessed with measurement at the moment. And breaking things down into tiny -- the tiniest things to be able to measure and report on and -- you know, it's -- so in channelizing a storyline based on these kind of significant events or even little events, so hence a storyline or in Bruner's terms, the paradigmatic belief or conclusion. And so here it seemed to -- to us that there was a coming together of these ideas that there is both the influence of the social world on the construction of identity, as well as the cognitive signs where we know that there is -- or at lease we theorize that there is this -- this forming of beliefs and schemism cost us of beliefs about self or the world and so on based on their experience, but our experience is social. And so it seemed like these constructivist thinkers -- and I'll show in a minute an example of when -- who -- who's taken these ideas. So hence these kind of self-defeating or problematic storylines, problematic beliefs, all it does go on and on and on. And my son despite lots of work with him and lots of encouragement and attempt to change that story, he still at 20 struggles with that storyline. He's found -- he's is a Navy chef now and he's pretty good, but he doesn't feel very good. He still feels like, but there is a bit of another story and -- and that's -- that's interesting. And Michael Wyatt was talked to when he was alive about how we live on multistoried life, I still love that, a multistoried life. When I first heard it, I thought I thought of Hong Kong and, you know, the tower and mega-millions of people living in this multistoried life, multistoried -- they live a multistoried life. But I think he meant something different. But this idea that we have multiple stories going on in our life from our learning and so on. And this -- this kind of constructivist view of cognitive therapy that has emerged in the lecture chair and I'll say a bit more about that in a minute. And Meichenbaum -- Donald Meichenbaum who's credited by Corey and Corey is the guy who bought the B into CBT. I don't think he was the only one, but Corey -- and Corey certainly created him with it, he bought the behavioral pattern to CBT. He's gone on in the '90s -- 1990s in the last 20 years, all out really in looking at a constructive narrative perspective on CBT and he's one of the people who brought these constructivist ideas in a long sight and the kind of belief forming ideas of CBT. So this -- this kind of picks up the idea that there are other stories, there are other events like this little could be missed. As narrative practitioners we talk about, you know, these are events that don't get storied because they're exceptional, they kind of sit outside of this dominant storyline. They are events that kind of don't mean anything to us, because they -- they don't fit somehow. For example, my son mostly because he was dragged along to tap dancing, you know, by the scruff of his neck for sort of 12 years or something and was taught by a dragon woman, who used to whack the kids and shout at them until I took her aside and said something to her once. But he was -- he was incredibly good at it. And he had medals and trophies, but it was just like -- it's just dancing and mum makes me do it. It wasn't a storyline. It wasn't an identity story that he had of any consequence. But -- and this is the kind of where can this constructive narrative is looking for these expectations, looking for these moments of difference, D for difference. And that if we take what is not being noticed and what's not being storied and start asking questions. And I've noticed in this last year as he sort of had enough of lift up. And he's starting to think what he does he want to do with his life now. And -- and I've been asking him questions about this. What -- why -- why did he get out his tap shoes and take them to the Navy when he was going to get ridiculed for that. And why did he get someone to type them doing something in the galley and put it on YouTube, why? They didn't sound kind of consistent with this chuhhh thing that he had about. And so -- and, you know, I don't -- don't think it's just my questions. But he's kind of putting this to be like he's joining the dots and he's now started looking at this -- what's this Australian one, Tap? 

00:42:35
 Tap Dogs. 

00:42:35
RICHARD COOK Tap Dogs, is it? And he's looking at -- he's starting to look online and look at places that he might be able to do that. And this is an example of forming, taking these moments of difference, these moments where, eh, they might not be disputing the old belief yet, but there's a little bit of data there that could be used to develop what Meichenbaum calls a constructive narrative with some new E for effects following. And -- and of course, this is an alternative narrative, isn't it? It's a different storyline made up of potentially different beliefs, different conclusions about self and they could be chased backwards in time to moments in his early tap dancing life, for example. And when he felt really good about achieving a medal or something, it could be also projected forwards into what could this mean for his future and what would this say about him, I mean what does this mean about himself and particularly how would this speak to this old idea of being useless. How would it speak back to that? How would he like to edit that storyline about himself? Now, of course, as a father, I'm probably not going to get to ask a lot of these questions, because I'm not going to put their hat on. Although I have to tell you a funny story while we are passing. My daughter, when she was in her late teens, uh, and she was making some decision rather and -- and I -- which I really did, but I got on my high. I started saying, look, sweetheart, you know, blah, blah, blah, so saying some things to her and she put up her hand and said, dad, don't counsel me. And I thought this is a very interesting idea about what counseling is. So I was actually quite pleased because then she realized, the only other things that I did, well, I normally just asked a question and drew out and -- she didn't even realize it was counseling. I thought yeah, yes, that's good. So -- hence she's decided to be a dancer and not a -- um, not a counselor. So these ideas of Meichenbaum, we'll go back to that one. 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:30
RICHARD COOK Oh, I didn't show you this one. Bruner, when he was talking about these -- these building blocks of narrative, he called them cultural products. He said, "We gain the self-told narratives that make and remake ourselves from the culture in which we live. We are virtually, from the start, expressions of the culture that nurtures us." It's quite an nice quote isn't it, right? I thought that was quite potent, really. So -- 

00:46:05
Guidano 

00:46:05
Disturbing events remain disturbing, 

00:46:05
Guidano argued, until they are integrated 

00:46:05
into this story of self and life. 

00:46:05
RICHARD COOK  We'll just flick through. So narratives, as we've being saying, these organized knowledge about and transactions with the social world and this kind of view, Guidano's idea, the disturbing events remain disturbing until they're integrated into this story of self and life. Um, we won't do that one. So what is post-rationalism and here are some examples of what they were -- what -- what we were reading that they were doing was that they were weaving to give out the exploration of -- of these narrative plots. These -- these lines of -- of -- kind of storylines and they were weaving them into a cognitively-based therapeutic model. And so people like Sharon Berlin and certainly Donald Meichenbaum and some of these others are writing from a constructivist or post-rationalist, in other words, Meichenbaum says I'm not a rationalist. And so he's still in the CBT school, but he's saying I actually see the -- much more of a constructivist way of seeing how people form the cognitive pathways within the social world. And that seemed to us an exciting centerpiece or middle tier in the cake, if you like. And for us we -- we -- we have a faith perspective. So this fits very well for us, this idea of not becoming conformed to the pattern of the world as -- as in this Paul's letter to the Romans we had talked about be conformed to the pattern or the -- squeezed into the shape of this world, but being transformed by the renewing of your mind. 

00:48:15
Congruence with faith- 

00:48:15
perspective 

00:48:15
Conguent with a key verse in Paul's call 

00:48:15
to the Roman Christians: 

00:48:15
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but 

00:48:15
be transformed by the renewing of your mind. 

00:48:15
Then you will be able to test and approve what 

00:48:15
God's will is - his good pleasing and perfect will. 

00:48:15
(Romans 12:2) 

00:48:15
RICHARD COOK So we kind of see this as a really supportive or a -- a verse from Christian ideas that kind of supports this notion that we are -- we are conformed in our social world and that there is the possibility of transformation of these kind of stories that we've carried around. 

00:48:45
A worldview base to underpin 

00:48:45
this post-rationalist 

00:48:45
perspective 

00:48:45
... I propose a form of critical realism. This is a 

00:48:45
way of describing the process of "knowing" 

00:48:45
that acknowledges the reality of the thing 

00:48:45
known as something other than the knower 

00:48:45
(hence "realism"), while fully acknowledging 

00:48:45
that the only access we have to this reality lies 

00:48:45
along the spiralling path of appropriate 

00:48:45
dialogue or conversation between the 

00:48:45
knower and the thing know (hence 

00:48:45
"critical"). (Wright, 1992 p. 35) 

00:48:45
RICHARD COOK But what's the world view that this sits on? And we think it sits really nicely on a critical realist. A critical realist view says there is something here and just like I tried to before, just get too close to it at some speed and you'll discover it is there. But what we call it and what we do with it, that's the critical, that's the piece of critical thinking, that's different from culture to culture, person to person and sometimes from context to context. The realism that is, it's there. You know, it's not if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear, did it make a noise. It's not that kind of philosophy. It's like saying realistically things exist. But we don't know what they are until we negotiate and name them and share the meanings and agree on the meanings and all of that. So that's a critical realist worldview base, a least to -- to, uh, some ideas about knowledge. And Tom Wright, that's a quote from Tom Wright. So we got the bottom tier of the cake. We got the middle tier, the view of people, problems and progress. This constructivist cognitive view and then a way of working. 

00:50:35
The top tier - a view of 

00:50:35
counselling: Post-rationalist 

00:50:35
constructivist CBT 

00:50:35
Meichenbaum: Constructivist Narrative 

00:50:35
Perspective (CNP) 

00:50:35
RICHARD COOK And Meichenbaum called it a constructive -- this -- or he called it constructive narrative perspective. Ah, I've talked to him by e-mail about this -- about this presentation and he -- he very much is a constructivist, but it is -- it's also constructive in that it's a kind of an ongoing process. He -- he's happy with that idea. 

00:51:05
Phase: Engagement 

00:51:05
a. Establish a strong collaborative 

00:51:05
relationship 

00:51:05
b. Negotiate a clear focus 

00:51:05
c. Make the process visible 

00:51:05
d. Explore the relevant dimensions of a 

00:51:05
person's life 

00:51:05
RICHARD COOK The first phase that we teach now, how do we teach this? Well, we teach it in three phases. Engagement, that is the lifeblood -- the lifeblood, isn't it, of art is, um, presenters this morning have been reinforcing, this is -- this is what it all grows out of the -- this relationship. We find that students that we need to negotiate a very clear focus and goal. We need to get them negotiating and contracting for the work. Many, many students very reluctant to do this and -- and so their work tends to be, you know, ambiguous because they're not really sure what the focus is, so that's -- we've made that very clear and making the process visible, especially to the client or the counselor, but also to the client. And then assessment or exploration of relevant dimensions. 

00:52:15
Phase 2: Exploring the 

00:52:15
Problem story 

00:52:15
a. Pay close attention to the Consequence, 

00:52:15
the effects of the "same old problem story" 

00:52:15
(the "C") 

00:52:15
b. Enquire about examples of concrete Activating 

00:52:15
Events (the "A") 

00:52:15
c. Discern together the Beliefs & stories (the "B") 

00:52:15
d. Ask the "hinge" questions: 

00:52:15
Hinge 1; "What is the impact...what is the toll...what is 

00:52:15
the price that you and others have paid?" 

00:52:15
Hinge 2; "How have you survived in spite of the 

00:52:15
strength of this problem?" 

00:52:15
RICHARD COOK Exploring the problem story. I've bought in the term the problem story here. That's my narrative background. But in other words, the problem -- exploring the problem. We call this Phase 2 with our students paying close attention to the consequential effects, narrative takes about effects, CBT, REBT, talk about C, the consequences, same thing. Or else Angus and Greenberg, the EFT therapist talk about the same old problem story, quite like that. Same old, same old. Do you have that saying of a -- certainly in Australia, maybe other parts of the world. And in inquiring about specific concrete examples of activating events, dots, events, dots, now points -- events that the person can remember. And what were the consequences? What were the feelings? What were the behaviors? What we know and as a result of those activating or sometimes good adverse effects -- events and then joining the dots. Okay. So what's the underlying kind of story or belief the paradigmatic shift that the person has or conclusion that the person has carried around? Well, my son, he joined these dots of this -- in this world that he lived in and he carried around this idea of uselessness. So discerning that, now that's not new, that's old for the fairly standard CBT stuff. What Meichenbaum introduces is the idea of, hey, we call them hinge questions. He didn’t, but he quite -- he likes this idea of going on hinge, like hinges on a gate. And this can hinge from one story into another, from a problem story into a different story, these hinge questions. And my hedge is that -- that you and I in a free brainstorm this, we would come up with a whole bunch of hinge questions, where we move between the problem and alternative moments. There could be questions that take us into strength or resiliences or into exceptions or into different thought lines that maybe dispute the -- but they -- they somehow act as hinges between, you know, like drafting. We draft a lot of sheep in New Zealand. We got more of them than a lot of us. So we have to draft them, you know. And the hinge -- draft it shifts between one and the other. So one of the hinge questions that -- that we've been -- that -- that Meichenbaum uses is this question, what is the impact? What is the toll? What is the price that you and others have paid for this belief? It's a little bit like if you're familiar with narrative, it's a little bit like asking the just -- just defying the evaluation question that Michael White used to use in his Maps of Narrative Practice. It's a little bit like saying why is this, why don't you like this belief? Why don't you like this behavior? Why don't -- what is it that you don't like about this? What is it that others? It's a bit like that because it's the something absent but implicit in there. And that therefore, to hinge questions. It's a hinge into a different storyline, what is the impact of this belief? What is the toll? And I think it's (inaudible ) work they talk about, they say we had enough here. You know, is -- is the toll of this enough for you to want something different, to want change? Is there price, so this is -- what does this cost you? And do you want to keep on going paying this price? So it's a hinge question, at least that's what we call it. And another one and these are just true, but my hunch is that that there's a whole lot more of these sort of hinge questions and that -- that there could be a lot of value in identifying more of these hinge questions actually. For the second one, this is similar to one of Meichenbaum's have you -- how have you survived in spite of the strength for this problem? How have you survived in spite of the strength of how powerful this problem has been or this belief has been in your life? How have you managed to let -- how's my son actually managed to keep going and become quite good as a chef and make able rank and like how has he managed to do that? What -- what -- what is this about him that he's been able to do that? Does he have that's a hinge question, takes you away from if you like a sheep running down the -- the -- the same old, same old problem story, I'm useless, I'm useless, I'm useless, I'm useless. And this hinge question just opens the -- opens the possibility of going down a different -- a different kind of line of thought. So Meichenbaum has this idea of -- of the in spite of story, the in spite of story. 

00:58:10
Phase 3: Developing the 

00:58:10
"In Spite Of" Story 

00:58:10
a. Gather Data 

00:58:10
moments of Difference 

00:58:10
cognitive steps that Dispute a train of thought 

00:58:10
small acts of resistance to the problem pattern 

00:58:10
strengths displayed in particular situations or roles 

00:58:10
evidence from experience that Disputes the Beliefs 

00:58:10
b. Use Data to unfreeze self-defeating beliefs/stories 

00:58:10
c. Develop the constructive life narrative 

00:58:10
RICHARD COOK So Phase 3 is developing the "in spite of" story and we are now working with our students to -- to recognize the how this storyline is being shaped and so on, and then to -- to ask those hinge questions and then to start gathering moments of difference. That's like the little purple circle on that other PowerPoint I had just, here's a moment of difference. And it's only one maybe, but then tell us about another one, different moments of difference and joining up those dots to invite a new conclusion or a new belief. A new train of thought, a new story, an "in spite of" story. So D for -- D for dispute, well, maybe we're all probably familiar with that from CBT and sort of REBT histories, but D for data, D for difference, D for months of difference in developing this "in spite of" story. I would add from -- from a narrative perspective, what small acts of resistance do people have to these problematic dynamics and beliefs and storylines and social messages that impinge on the light. What are the small protest signs that they might hold up? And sometimes with clients, I'll get the making a protest sign. We make a little banner to give it and they take it home, put a stick on it and put it on their wall as a protest banner to old story, the old problem, so that they keep on protesting it and standing up for something different, get a little bit of agency going, bit of activism. So, you know, I think -- think that's useful of this -- of this phase as well. What strengths are being displayed in particular situations, so this brings in some of the strengths-based work or at least a strengths stance, appreciate stance. And evidence from -- other evidence from the experience. Join up some more dots to get this dispute going. And being the Meichenbaum's terms to use this data to unfreeze and to restory these self-defeating beliefs. And he uses -- he talks about restorying. So here he has attributed his -- you know, one of the leading names and the development of CBT internationally. And he has adopted these constructivist ideas, which have for us solved something of our headache. But just to bring this session to a close and thank you for coming. And hope these ideas might be of some use to you as they have been to us. So thank you very much.
