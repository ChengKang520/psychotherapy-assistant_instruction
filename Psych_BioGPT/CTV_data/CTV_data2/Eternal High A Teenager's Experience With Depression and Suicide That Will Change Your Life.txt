00:04:30
BLAKE MACKIE I'm waiting for days to do this. I'm nervous but at the same time sad. 

00:04:40
[sil.] 

00:04:45
BLAKE MACKIE That’s all I’ve been able to think about. I just had to find the right time. 

00:04:55
[sil.] 

00:05:15
BLAKE MACKIE I know particularly well but this stuff can do a delight in how to ruin the best of people. I don't care though. Now I'm out of the world. I don't hear my family. I'm happy to a degree. [00:05:30I just feel like those are the sort of emptiness that I've never been able to fill. All this I don't really need to strugel if I keep living or not. I'm not saying I want to die but I don’t think I necessarily go out and say good bye either. I'm a free mental person, but what pesos me off and I can't see a point of data in life. Sure I feel pain and it hurt. But there isn't a whole lot pleasure to counter that. Yes, there are times when I took this is the greatest that has, it just doesn't latched, no long enough anyways. Everything usually just seems to obliged, so colorless. 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:20
BLAKE MACKIE I've done drugs before, they don't use my pain because they don't have much, I mean that's my problem. I don't need anymore drama in my life that makes things more interesting. At times I feel like naturally such a downer, when you look it from the big perspective, just so points in that as you put in god, I think there I some life after death. To my view I'm not so sure about. So what do I have, what do I have to look forward to? Did I really need to get up to that? It's funny how interesting it is thought, things about life. I guess that does get me excited on how people like and interesting. I mean, what's your little mind so I'm thinking about the point that stuck in you life and really mattered nine years, we really do look at things differently. but I don’t that will fade. You will again go back to every day life and thinking. I'm realizing never really talked about things that Stephen not surely and though depressed, but then again we ran without knowing it. And maybe I just like thinking it out. Think about why I'm sitting here on my bed with nothing to do. Well I'll go watch TV and play basket ball, call my friend, I see no point and for that I had these white pills. These little things in life called drugs that provided temporary pleasure, pleasure that will come and go and so it comes. 

00:07:55
[sil.] 

00:12:00
BLAKE MACKIE My body doesn't feel so warm anymore. As a matter of fact I feel very cold and nearly. Maybe I took many piles. Maybe I'll just lay here. Is it sad I've never felt so content in my floor with saliva dripping from my pare lips. Is in a shame I wish I never came down. An Eternal High, an Eternal Greatness. Do I mind if I live or not. Is there a motivation? Nothing really stands out. I think I'll just lay here.

Written and Directed by Bryce Mackie Eternal High On March 30, 2006 Bryce spoke to his high school to tell his personal story. 

00:13:25
BLAKE MACKIE Hi guys and it will be just a couple of minutes to go and I'm here to talk to you about something no one really likes to talk about. Of course the… it's an uncomfortable subject. It's something that people are usually shamed of if they have… have a problem with depression the usually don't want to tell about it and they might have towing myself a bit. Three kids have killed themselves in the past year or two Lakeview. Couple of months ago a kid killed himself Lakeview. And 50% of suicides are because are because of depression. And suicide… depression is the number one leading cause of suicide. And I think that says something and it's funny because that's kind of starting and that shouldn't really be starting because everyone should no about that. And everybody… everybody being hearing, there's been talks you know when you're younger about you know set sad in Math and Sports and things like that. But never thinking about depression in usual life and this is the first time that I know that anyone spoken about depression. First time you'll probably hear about depression. You never, you know just a panther who says if you depressed go hear or talk to this person. I still start to kind of say like; you know no one really wants to talk to their council usually. I mean not so many people, hope that you know no one really wants to go to anybody to talk about how mad they feel and some of you kids will be able to relate to this, so many kids who may have no idea what I’m talking about because depression is something, it is an illness, it's not something that which happens. Its like, "Oh my god, I'm… I'm really depressed because you know I… I haven't been able to get good grade and I'm not…" No that's… that's not same thing, depression is an illness. It is an illness which you would know out there. They think it's just something that happens to them, when they're just sad or hurt…. But ways you can tell you impressed, is if you just, if you constantly pressed for your sad life and happy or if you catchy. If life doesn't seem to have a point, if suicide comes in your mind right away, if you thought about myself and can though of planning yourself or… or doing anything like that, well if you have a big problem and I didn't think, I did and I made this movie not knowing anything about depression. I knew my dad had it before, that’s about all I know about depression, I finished the movie about eight months ago and I finished it not only as depressed, not knowing that I was you know on the verge of doing something horrible. It all started in last September when I realized I was severely pressed out this crime for no reason sometimes. And I would just be in horrible mood. I think myself, I thinking nothing myself about the nastier points of life. And death seemed like a better option. I wait over the morning and be disappointed that I woke up because it's another day and that just sucks. And you haven't gone through depression you have you know idea about what it is. If you have no clue, think about the worst time you had and think about that every single day, that's what depression is. It's downward spiral and getting help with some upward spiral. Not only did I have depression, but I had anxiety. If you don't know what that it is, think about when you get nervous, at time I got a million. I got so bad that even after two months or something my girls in this foremen. I couldn't, it was the worst because I couldn't even talk to her. I mean, I'll be at the dinner and I will be shaking and I've been sweating and I couldn't you know I mean imagine the first you love more than anything like, you can't even talk to them, you can't even speak to them. It spread to my friends, it spread to my teachers, it spread to very body in my family and I just, I didn't want - if… if you can't talk to anybody then you know there is point to lie and no one inform me about this, no one told me what was wrong, so what was I suppose to think you know the… the thing that came to my mind was to kill on myself and I never… I never attempted suicide, but I thought about death a lot and I thought about how point this life was and I also was very bad after I got help because why hadn't anyone informed about this. You know I know about safe sex, I know about all these thing but no one told me you know what kids are suppose to do when they want to kill themselves. I mean kids are died and no one is telling anybody about it. Everyone keeping it you know so restricted, oh, lets not talk about that is, that's not right, that has to be with that. I don't not real comfortable about that, well in a second come to it because kids are so dying. You know the suicide really is not going down right now. Kids would some time and… and I would get happy to… to move along even more or being in my car alone because I had such a bad anxiety that I never want to be around anyone. When I get home, I just be so relieved that I close the door I mean alone in my room. And that's… that's ridicules that is ridicules. So whatever I'm going to go with this, well if I didn't have good parents and I didn't have a supportive family probably I would have killed my self, I don't but I would have, but I might have been one of the kids that you read on the paper, while you've seen like you have a kid well it wasn't. And when you are depressed you are able to cover up very, very well. I never been in class with Eric Kochanowski(ph) in English forum and joking around and kind laughing and making them to love and then right after that slightly I had a turn this side so she couldn’t see me and starting to cry. And that just tells you that you cannot tell from the outside that someone is happy or not. No matter how many times I tell that you're happy, they could be the most, think the most happy person in your life and they could be the most… most suicidal person you could ever imagine you normally no. So what I did was, I talked to my parents and said well you're father is going to this that actually run the family and we need to get home, so I went to a concern and I didn't want to go to a concern, I though that was stupid and I don't want to talk to anybody who thinks they going to talking markes them stupid. And I'm sure lot of you guys feel like that's just down, why should I talk to some old guy about my problems you know. I might as well just you know smok some marowana or something. So what I did was, I went to the concern sat down with a cross eyed lady that just ticked me off and she came and looked me in both eyes. So great one and half or I was barred time with her and she's like why you don't want to talk about your problem, either think happy thoughts, happy thoughts. And I was like screw you kind a thinking, and then after about couple of weeks just her confident talking to me and graining what to think in my mind did hope to agree in this crossed eye old lady the things she used to stop actually helped me you know to pray. But I still wasn't to be enough better, I still in a core of anxiety and to break up with my girl friend and to tell her couldn't be here any more you know obviously she was confused and she cried a lot (inaudible ) we broke up and you know those thing not doing anything better, but it made me feel about because I had to be around here and I don't want to be around anyone. I broke with my girlfriend for about two weeks and then said, well, you know screw it all what I feel about with you who will ever argue, so we started dating in. But anyway, so on the concern she said, oh, you know not a lot that's working right now so you don't you get any medication. So they put me in this drug, so called miracle drug but I'm saying a pill make you feel ever better but its made me feel a hell of a lot better it's called so celexa, I'm not trying to advertise you know drugs or anything but it has saved my life and it has made me feel better on myself, it made me to think better and I didn't want to take medication either you know that's for… that's for kids who are week right, medication. It's medication to people who can't handle life themselves, so they - it took a pill of better, well if we… if we have a little pill in the morning makes me feel better. And if a little pill makes it so I don't like sue(ph) myself, well then I'm going to collateral manure on pill because this is stupid, just take… just take the pill and it gets too bad, you had a big deal, it's okay, it's so great, it's okay to cry. You know every things out to be tough guys, I… I don't cry, I'll never be cry, oh yeah right, probably, liar. So yeah, (inaudible ) the pressure went on for six months and from September to January I just… I wanted to die everyday and very day was horrible and no one new about and hasn't told them. And it does one family and I got help and after I made the movie and… and now my life is… is upside down, it is like changed and I don't feel like all I should do is just tell you guys about it because you probably don't do anything about it you know most even adults don't know anything about. Well I've heard depression, but you know I heard it's bad but I don't really on it and what I'm talking about, well okay well something is going to come with me. So lets see… yeah, so… so I just changed my life and I and it sucks because, even my friends around that had really, really impressed some of them, I'm not saying all, I mean, this is group of depressed kids that I just, oh, there is a depression. It's… it's sucks because parents are like well they are destroying to their teenage years and depression that can started, that you know I know a kid who tired to kill himself in fourth grade, it doesn't started if 13, when you are 13 years you can hear off from depression now, it can start as early in elementary school and it can starts in third grade you know whatever. And he goes all the way our to die, you can… you can get depressed anytime in your life even if doesn't around the own family certain things will trigger and its all right to feel bad, it's all right to be week, it is okay to be a week, stop trying to be superman okay. So parents especially don't listen to their kids or they embrace that their kids are depressed, he'll never seen embraced, but oh no, Johnny has gone depressed, Johnny as just gone to… he is you know he just… he just going through teen years. Oh, that's stupid no Johnny seems like reserve type, I mean. Do you want to drink buddy? No, no, no you have nothing to think about that. And you do need to listen to the kids and you know your parents are listen to you because I have friends whose parents don't want to do anything about. He and his friends just didn't listen to him, I have a lot of friends doing that. Then the kids are going to drugs, you know I woudl go into drugs you the same drugs are drugs in escape and drugs to make you more depressed, I'm not saying any one you know when should drink anything but, when ever you drink or your drugs are trying to escape something, and whether that would escape your real life to feel better or escape your bad life feel better. If I were I (inaudible ) drugs and… and drinking actually makes me more depressed and I know that sounds crazy, well in long run it really does. Every time you do with the next day, you are a little more impressiveyou cant let go. So that never helps things but your in drugs, now you can still smoke out of way that drink a lot and they're trying to escape reality. But they don't want to tell anybody about it, they don't we tell him haven't got it because your embarrassed. So if you talk to your parents and they don't listen to you and when you talk to your friends they all listen to you, when you talk to your teachers they don't listen to you, keep taking to someone and you can home. It's not that hard to start counseling or… or take a pill because it will change your life in a few minutes. And thinking about suicide, and think about killing yourself or thinking about slip your risk which I have a comment for any one's like to take a blade and to cut it in your skin if you are better knife with you, I know it's like to punch yourself in the head over and over to feel better, you know it is like to be so depressed in the morning that the only thought that makes you feel better is putting your shock into your head and blowing your self away over and over, it bring smile on face. And I never use to know what that meant, you would kids got the wrist, that stupid, these kids are stupid right, well if you did so down and you feel so depressed, the only thing that can feel better is if you inflict a pain and I never use to understand that until that morning I went and cut my rists and it felt so good to see blood, it felt so good to… to see pain because it took away from the other brain and I just that that's real and knows very healthy, you know I nearly pounds lets tell me out, no one wants to talk to me about it because everyone is afraid to talk about the problems I was felt with nothing. And if there wasn't for my parents that helped me, I don't know I might have been one those kids who worry about the paper. So If I would have great parents, I probably considered. I had all these great things I find great, I had tells this to my girl friend and then you guys are everything, and everything was wrong and it goes to production. So please don't feel afraid to talk some of that to get help. There is nothing wrong in getting help. There is nothing wrong in talking to it. If I can talk to an old class I meanly, you can talk to me when I was fine. So yeah that's my story. Other there is obviously you kind of give some questions, is there anyone hopefully guessed to ask me a question? Is anybody having a questions about why you felt that or what depression is or what anxiety is or… 

00:28:20
I have a question? 

00:28:20
BLAKE MACKIE Ok. You Pass that up. 

00:28:30
(inaudible ) 

00:28:31
BLAKE MACKIE Okay, the question was how long it will take I mean to get mean to over my depression. It took me probably about two to three months ones I started my vacation and then I felt extremely better and everything was good and I don't want to kill myself anymore. Okay, have you heard that, get… get the message? 

00:28:55
Yeah. 

00:28:55
