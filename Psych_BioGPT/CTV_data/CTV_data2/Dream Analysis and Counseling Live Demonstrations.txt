Microtraining Associates, Inc. Presents Dream Analysis and Counseling: Live Demonstrations by John F. Marszalek III, Ph.D. Produced by John F. Marszalek III and Michael S. Franklin 

00:00:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  A client, Gary, walks in to your office and says he had a dream that he can't stop thinking about. 

00:01:10
GARY  I'm sitting with my family outside of our farmhouse. And I see train tracks leading from the backyard and out to the woods behind the house. In the woods, I noticed that the train tracks cross the bridge. Somehow I know that if I take a train over the bridge, I would be heading to New York City and away from my family. 

00:01:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  As the Counselor, what do you do? Do you say that dreams are nothing more than an unorganized, meaningless jumble of thoughts, and that he shouldn't worry about it? Or do you believe in that dreams represent feelings and thoughts from our unconscious minds, help the client explore the meaning of the dream? If you're like me, you help the client figure out what the dream means. You help him analyze the dream. 

00:02:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Hello, I'm John Marszalek. As a Counselor and a Counselor Educator, I believe that dream analysis can be a powerful tool, in helping clients develop deeper insight into themselves and deeper insight into their worlds. My views aren't unique. Dream analysis has fascinated people since ancient times, from the Babylonians and Egyptians, to early psychologists, such as, Freud, Jung and Adler,- 

00:02:25
THE DREAM GAME 

00:02:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  dreams have been viewed as a source of personal knowledge, guidance and insight. In this video, you will view one approach to dream analysis. As you watch the video, remember that there is no perfect approach. Depending on the personalities, of the counselors and clients, what works for some may not work for others. The approach discussed here is an integrative approach that draws from a variety of theories, but especially from object relations, union, person-centered and Gestalt theories. The dream analysis techniques from these theories are integrated into Ivey's Developmental Counseling Therapy or DCT Model. 

00:03:15
Developmental Counseling Therapy (DCT) Model A Cognitive-Behavioral Approach 

00:03:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III The DCT model is an integrative, cognitive-behavioral model that outlines a developmental counseling approach, enabling counselors to evaluate the cognitive level of clients and systematically select appropriate counseling interventions, to facilitate client development. 

00:03:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Dream analysis can easily turn into an intellectual exercise but never go beyond that. It is easy to be caught up in the intrigue of solving a mystery, but never helping clients get in touch with their emotions and behaviors. 

00:03:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  DCT helps clients develop insight into their cognitions, emotions, and behaviors. There are three main parts to this video: Part one provides a brief discussion on Ivey's Developmental Counseling Therapy Model. If you already have a good understanding of the DCT model, this section will be a review for you. Part two presents how DCT can be applied to dream analysis, describes the steps for using DCT to analyze dreams and includes clips from real dream analysis demonstrations. Part three includes a full, uninterrupted dream analysis demonstration. 

00:04:35
PART ONE DCT MODEL 

00:04:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Allen Ivey outlined his DCT Model, and described how counselors can evaluate the cognitive level of clients, and systematically select developmentally appropriate counseling interventions, with the goal of facilitating client development. Ivey drew from both Piaget and Plato in describing adult cognitive development. 

00:05:20
Piaget's Child Development Model 

00:05:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Piaget's Child Development Stage model included the Sensorimotor, Pre-operational, Concrete Operational and Formal Operational stages. According to Piaget, children move through these stages until they are between 11 and 15 years of age, when they possibly reach the Formal Operation stage. Ivey advanced Piaget's model by theorizing that development is an on going process that is both circular and spherical. Consequently, individuals continue to develop cognitively after their childhood, as they confront various issues in their lives, and assimilate, and accommodate information from their environments. 

00:06:05
FOUR COGNITIVE STYLES 

00:06:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Ivey's model includes four cognitive levels or styles with early and late development evident in each of these styles, as I'll describe to you. 

00:06:15
PIAGETIAN CONCEPTS Sensorimotor Concrete operational Formal operational 

00:06:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III The first three styles are based on a metaphorical interpretation of Piaget's Cognitive stages. And the fourth style is based on a metaphorical- (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
PLATONIC CONCEPTS Knowledge & Intelligence 

00:06:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - interpretation of Plato's concepts of knowledge and intelligence. Unlike Piaget's conceptualization of childhood development, in Ivey's model for adults, one style is not superior to another. Rather, each style is an important alternative perspective, that is, as valuable as all others. Like Piaget, Ivey believed that not all people- 

00:06:50
IVEY'S DCT MODEL * One style is not superior to another * Each style is valuable * Not everyone functions in all styles 

00:06:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - are capable of functioning at all the cognitive styles especially the Formal and Post-formal stages. 

00:06:55
ACTIVITY 

00:06:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  To help you better understand the DCT styles as I described them to you, I'm going to lead you through a short exercise that Allen Ivey uses in his workshops on DCT. I'm going to put an image on this screen. Focus on the image for a moment, and after about a minute, I'm going to ask you a question related to the image. 

00:07:25
[sil.] 

00:07:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  What occurs for you, when you focus on this image? 

00:07:45
[sil.] 

00:07:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  As I described each of the DCT styles to you, I'm going to apply them to what you may have experienced as you focused on the image. 

00:08:25
[sil.] 

00:08:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  If you focused on your senses as you took in the image, you are operating from a Sensorimotor style. You may have actually felt the warmth of the sun, smell the air as the sun went down, or you may have experienced a feeling, such as, peacefulness but did not actually define it. The Sensorimotor style refers to the experience, awareness and meaning of felt body experiences or emotions. When a client is totally focused on their emotions, and cannot do anything but emote, they're processing from a Sensorimotor style. For example, a client with depression who states, "I just feel so much pain. I really hurt." 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Maybe as you looked at the image, it appeared blurry to you and you thought that maybe you needed new glasses. You then thought that you really should have had your eyes checked earlier, and you probably ruined your eyes, and they'll never be good again. In fact, you probably never see right again. In this example, you will be operating from a Late Sensorimotor level, what- 

00:09:45
Piaget's Preoperational Thinking 

00:09:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - Piaget called, Pre-operational Thinking. A Late Sensorimotor style is characterized by irrational or magical thoughts such as should or ought. Ivey stated that most individuals enter counseling with problems they are viewing from a Pre-operational perspective. An initial capacity for Concrete Thinking does not occur until the end of this stage as individuals begin to make the transition to Concrete-motor Thinking. An example of the client is the client with depression I mentioned above who says, "I know I'll never feel better again." 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  If you focused on the details of the image, and maybe said to yourself, I see mountains, I see a sun, I see trees, then you are operating from a Concrete Operational style. An early Concrete Operational style is characterized by concrete detailed language. As when clients describe the details of their days to you, or answer your questions in short, single word responses. When someone is operating from this style, they're not thinking abstractly. 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Individuals at the Late Concrete Operational style use causal-if-then thinking. You may have thought to yourself, that when I focused on this sunset, I feel peaceful. In this case, you might be feeling the peacefulness at a Sensorimotor level, and then making the connecting that you feel that feeling when you look at the sunset. An example of a client operating from this style would be a client who states, "If I exercise, then I feel less depressed." 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Maybe when you focused on the image, you were reminded of a time when you watched the sunset and begin thinking about that experience. You realized that when you've watched the sunset before, or viewed other beauties of nature, you felt peaceful, both in your previous experience and as you focused on the image today. In this case, you were focusing from an early formal operational style, where you reflect on your concrete descriptions of events and recognize patterns. The Formal Operational style involves analyzing and thinking abstractly. For example, a client realizes that she became depressed recently when she felt the loss of control in her work environment due to a controlling supervisor. She remembers the time when she got depressed at school when she had a strict controlling teacher. She sees a pattern of depression and loss of control. Or in a more positive vein, she may see a pattern of feeling less depressed when she has more control, such as when she exercises or meditate. 

00:13:10
[sil.] 

00:13:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  When people are operating from a Late Formal Operational style, they recognize what Ivey called, Patterns of patterns. They understand how patterns of thoughts, behaviors and emotions can be connected. Maybe when you focused on the image of the sunset, you thought about how you felt peaceful when you watched sunsets, and other times when you appreciated nature. Maybe you also thought about your pattern of feeling peaceful when you work in your city garden, or cared for your indoor plants. You realized your pattern of feeling peaceful, when you work with your plants, is connected to the peacefulness you experience when you appreciate nature. An example with the client I mentioned above would be when she realizes that her pattern of feeling depressed or not having control, is related to a pattern of behaving in a way that leads to a loss of control, such as when she is unassertive. 

00:14:15
EARLY DIALECTIC 

00:14:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Ivey theorized that adults are capable of abstract thinking beyond the Formal Operation stage. To describe this type of abstract thinking, he referred to Plato's concepts of Knowledge and Intelligence. Adults in the Dialectic stage reach new levels of comprehension by understanding that their view of the world is influenced by their dialectic with the environment. In other words, they understand that they do not live in a vacuum, and that they cannot avoid being influenced by the environment in which they exist. The Dialectic also refers to rules, often unconscious, by which we make choices in life. These rules typically developed in a family environment when we were children and are not functional for healthy adult relationships. People's ability to step back from themselves and see alternative perspectives and patterns is Dialectical Thinking. Maybe as you focused on the image, you thought about how you feel peaceful when you watch sunsets, and also thought about times when you felt peaceful, when you appreciated nature. Maybe you also thought about your pattern of feeling peaceful working in your city garden or caring for your indoor plants. You realized that the pattern of feeling more peaceful, when you're in nature, is related to a pattern of behavior in which you care for nature. You further realized that you grew up in a family that valued the environment and nature. You realized how your family's values influenced you, and you recall times when your family went camping or hiking, and you felt a sense of connection with them. An example with the client that I mentioned above would be, when she realizes that her pattern of feeling depressed, were not having control, is related to a pattern of behaving in a way that leads to loss of control, such as being unassertive. She further realizes that she grew up in an environment in which she felt little control, because she never knew how her alcoholic father would be from day to day. She dealt with the situation by being passive and not rocking the boat. 

00:16:35
LATE DIALECTIC 

00:16:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Adults functioning in the Dialectic level understand that the knowledge they acquire is constantly changing. In a process that Ivey called, Dialectical Deconstruction- 

00:16:55
DIALECTIC DECONSTRUCTION 

00:16:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - previously held knowledge or beliefs are deconstructed, leading to new points of view. Fresh knowledge and view points often lead to the beginning of another cycle through development, because this new knowledge is initially processed at less complex cognitive levels. Consequently, higher levels of thinking can lead to new insight. This new insight is frequently reprocessed at Pre-operational and Concrete Thinking levels- 

00:17:25
Concrete Operational 

00:17:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - before individuals process it at a more abstract level. For example, your realization that you felt connected to your family even when you're not with them, gives you new feelings that you haven't felt before. And you begin processing them at a Sensorimotor and later a Concrete Operational level. The client who realizes how her early family environment affected her depression and her ability to cope with her depression might feel anger or hope. She may need time to feel and process these feelings at a Sensorimotor and a Concrete level. 

00:18:00
ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION 

00:18:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  You can assess these four styles by using a structured clinical interview, or by being aware of the style for which your client presents his or her presenting issue. Clients usually have a preferred style, but may not function in that style depending on the issue. Clients may present with developmental blocks in this style when they face a particular issue, when they're not able to process their issue in the manner represented by that style. Once you've made an assessment of the client's primary cognitive style relative to a particular issue, and of any existing developmental blocks, you can develop an appropriate treatment plan. 

00:18:50
CLIENT = Concrete Operational COUNSELOR = Concrete Operational 

00:18:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You can choose to match your preference for a particular cognitive style both to facilitate the Counselor and Client relationship and to expand horizontal development- 

00:19:00
CLIENT = Concrete Operational COUNSELOR = Sensorimotor or Formal Operational 

00:19:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - in Ivey's Model. Or, you can choose to mismatch the preferred style to promote vertical development. For example, clients who prefer to function in a Sensorimotor style or who have blocks in that level, may benefit from any approach that involves the senses, such as, Relaxation, Bio-feedback or Gestalt Techniques. Clients who prefer or are blocked in the Concrete level, may benefit from Problem Solving, Reality Therapy or Rationale-Emotive Behavior Therapy approaches. 

00:19:30
Client Centered, Psychoanalytic 

00:19:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Formal Operational clients respond well to client-centered methods and Psychoanalytic approaches. 

00:19:40
Multicultural, Psychoanalytic, Systemic 

00:19:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Dialectic clients are best matched with Systemic, Multicultural approaches and techniques, and Psychoanalytic approaches that focus on the transferential relationship. 

00:19:50
PART TWO DREAM INTERPRETATION 

00:19:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Before you use DCT to help clients interpret their dreams, there are several important points to consider. First, the predominant DCT styles of clients determine the extent that they will be motivated to engage in dream work. For example, some clients operate predominantly from a concrete operational style. They are less likely to view dream work as meaningful and important as compared to clients who operate predominantly from a Formal Operational level. It is important for counselors not to push clients- 

00:20:40
Do not push clients into dream work. 

00:20:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - into dream work if they are not motivated to do so. Second, DCT can be used to help clients engage in dream work in one or multiple DCT styles. 

00:20:50
Help client experience dreams from multiple styles 

00:20:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Researchers with DCT have found that clients, who operate from multiple levels in making meaning of their environments, have fewer physiological and psychological symptoms. Helping clients experience dreams from multiple DCT levels gives them a richer experience of the dream. Third, DCT can be used to determine the styles from which clients experience dreams. For example, sometimes clients state they had a dream but remember no details about it. They only recall vague feelings or bodily sensations. It may seem that without a detailed description of what happened in the dream, the dream is worthless. However, understanding the clients have held on to the Sensorimotor aspects of the dream, can enable the counselor to help the client explore the Sensorimotor fragments thus, beginning the DCT process of moving from Sensorimotor to Concrete and eventually to more abstract understandings of the dream. 

00:21:50
Sensorimotor Concrete operational Formal operational Dialectic Dream Interpretation and DCT styles SENSORIMOTOR 

00:21:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  In the Sensorimotor style, clients will identify vague feelings or sensations in their body during the dream or when they first awake. 

00:22:15
Vague feelings or sensations in body 

00:22:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III They may have difficulty remembering the concrete details of the dream or labeling the feelings from the dream. 

00:22:20
Difficulty remembering concrete details 

00:22:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III They may recall an image or various images from the dream. 

00:22:25
Not able to tell the story. 

00:22:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III However, they cannot describe how the images connected to encompass the dream, for instance, as one would tell a story. 

00:22:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  You said when you woke up, you were feeling afraid. 

00:22:40
 Uh hmm. I was feeling afraid and it was kinda like a warm sensation right here- (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

00:22:45
 - and my heart was like pounding, pounding and I was trying to like remember it and the more I thought about it, the more my heart was pounding and the more I was gonna,- (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  So you got to feel that- (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - even when you woke up- (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
 Yes, I did. 

00:22:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - you feel that, that fear- (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
 Yes. 

00:22:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - right there in your chest. 

00:22:55
  Uh hmm. You know, I'm just very hot more it's, it's like there are moments like a burning or something. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III A burning. 

00:23:05
CONCRETE OPERATIONAL 

00:23:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Clients can describe the details of the dream and relate them as if telling a story. 

00:23:15
Can tell the story 

00:23:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III They can describe how certain details of the dream made them feel, for example, their sensations or emotions. Clients do not have an understanding - 

00:23:25
Do not connect dream to waking world 

00:23:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - of the deeper meaning of the dream nor do they understand how aspects of the dream may be connected to their waking world. 

00:23:30
  I remember myself riding in my car, in my truck, and it was a rainy, like a rainy night. And I pulled up to my garage and the door was already open, the garage door. (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Garage door is open. (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
 Uh hmm. And I got inside the garage, but I didn't have my car anymore. It was just me, kinda like, running in and I hurried up and pressed the button for the, the door to go down because I don't, you know, I don't want anyone to come, to come in behind me. So, ah, but I couldn't get the button. I tried to press it but I couldn't, uh, get my fingers on it because I have some kinda gloves in my hand and they were plastic. 

00:24:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
 And I also have some kinda rubber over my eyes. 

00:24:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
  So, I really couldn't see that well but I finally got the button pressed and the door was going down. And as the door was going down, I pulled the rubber, got it off from my eyes. 

00:24:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Formal Operational clients can recall something from their waking world that is similar to a part of the dream. 

00:24:35
Connect waking world and dream 

00:24:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  They see a pattern in between an occurrence in their waking world and something that happened in the dream, something they felt in the dream or something they thought in the dream. 

00:24:45
Can be from present or past 

00:24:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  The occurrence in the waking world can be from the present or the past. Clients who have moved to a more abstract stage of the Formal Operational level, may also be able to identify more than one similarity between aspects of the dream and the waking world. For example, clients may identify an occurrence from the present and an occurrence from the past that is related to one aspect of the dream. They may be able to understand how the occurrences are not only related to an aspect of the dream but how the occurrences are related to each other to form a pattern, in essence what Ivey called, "patterns of patterns." 

00:25:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  I wonder if you can think of a time when you felt that before. Have you, if you ever felt that same feeling there, that fear and that feeling in your chest? 

00:25:40
 Hmm, I mean, the only other time that I can think of is when I have nightmare or when I've been very afraid. 

00:25:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III When you've been very afraid. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  When, when is the time in your life that you've been very afraid? 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:25:55
  I don't know. The only time that I can think of is when, well, if I'm, when I was younger, if I was alone in the house and actually, this is weird, but when I was younger, I used to think like, I used to, I used to have it on Sunday nights, I used to have that sensation and when it was time for me to go to bed, when my mom will say, "Okay it's time for you to go to bed," and I'd get that feeling and then I'd think, "Okay, this is the night that I'm gonna die,"- (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
 - which is weird. I was like nine- (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You're nine. 

00:26:30
 - when I was thinking that thing. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And you have that same feeling inside. (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
 Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:26:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Huh. Looking back, looking back now, do you, do you know what was going on that may have made you feel that way or what was happening inside you? 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:50
  Hmm, no I can't really, I can't really think of anything. I just know that, like, when I used to watch TV and things like that, how to internalize everything. Like one other time when I was nine, there was this thing going on called the Atlanta Child Murders and I just knew that- (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:27:15
 - tonight, it's gonna come and murder me and, you know, take me away and then, and when I think about stuff like that, I'm actually the victim and I think like, what is going on like the moment. 

00:27:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Clients operating from a Dialectic level are able to put all the pieces of the dream together. 

00:27:30
Can put all of the pieces together 

00:27:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  For example, clients understand how parts of themselves are represented by various figures in the dream. They develop an interpretation of the dream, understanding what the dream means for them and how the dream has led to deeper insight into themselves. 

00:27:50
Develop an interpretation of the dream 

00:27:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Developing an interpretation of the dream means the clients can see the overall pattern of the many connections they have discovered between aspects of the dream and their waking worlds. Dialectical deconstruction occurs when they begin to process their insight at a Sensorimotor or concrete level. 

00:28:10
Dialectical deconstruction How do you feel? What did you learn? 

00:28:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III For example, when the counselor asks, "How did you feel when you discovered the meaning of the dream?" Or, "What did you learn about what we discussed today?" 

00:28:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Well, I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about, the uhm, I'm not sure if there's a connection here, but this, what in my mind was, you talking about the serial killer, and talking about how you want, you wanna know what his profile is, what kind of person he is going after, you wanna make sure that you don't do something wrong, put yourself in the, in the wrong place, so that obviously, you know, something doesn't' happen to you. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And it sounds very similar to what you're talking about your life right now. That, uhm, you wanna make sure you do everything right or something bad could happen. In this case disappointing people. 

00:28:55
 Uh hmm, yeah. You know, that stuff not just for myself. 

00:29:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. How do you feel right now as you're talking about this? 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:15
  I guess kinda sad, because it's like the cat's out of the bag now; because nobody knew that but me. 

00:29:35
STEPS TO DREAM INTERPRETATION 

00:29:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  When a client presents a dream, you can help the client explore the dream by integrating - 

00:29:45
See the resource list at the end of this video for information on the Standard Cognitive Developmental Interview (SCDI). 

00:29:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - Ivey's standard Cognitive Developmental Interview into the flow of the session. 

00:29:50
Match or mismatch 

00:29:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Or, you can use a more unstructured approach by matching or mismatching your intervention based on the client's cognitive style. And you'll see when you view the dream analysis demonstrations, I tend to use a more unstructured approach and base my interventions on the client's style. My goal is to help the client process a dream from as many styles as possible. 

00:30:15
Begin in an unstructured manner. 

00:30:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  It's important to begin a discussion of the dream in an unstructured manner, asking the client to discuss the residue from a dream. This approach will result in the client providing their initial construction of the meaning of the dream and it's important for later deconstruction. 

00:30:30
Residue can be images, feelings, or thoughts 

00:30:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Usually, the residue consists of dream images. However, sometimes, the most powerful residue is a combination of images, feelings and thoughts. I'm going to discuss the steps that I have found helpful on processing dreams of clients. 

00:30:45
It is most important to follow the natural flow of the session. 

00:30:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  However, adhering to the steps is less important than following the natural flow of the session. If you notice a change in effect or know from past experience that a client tends to struggle with being defended, it is important to encourage the client to talk about their feelings regarding the discussion of the dream, but not to force them to process painful material until they choose to do so. 

00:31:10
STEP ONE 

00:31:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  First, begin with the client generated dream fragment and use active - 

00:31:25
Begin with a client generated dream fragment. Use active listening to help client talk about the dream. 

00:31:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - listening techniques to help the client talk about the dream. 

00:31:25
Begin with a dream fragment 

00:31:25
  Uhm, it really didn't have a beginning and, and an ending. Uhm, I remember myself riding in my car, in my truck, and it was a rainy, like a rainy night. And I pulled up to my garage and the door was already open, the garage door. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Garage door is open. 

00:31:50
 Uh hmm. And I got inside the garage but I didn't have my car anymore. It was just me, kinda like running in, and I hurried up and pressed the button for the, the door to go down because I don't, you know, I don't want anyone to come, to come in behind me. So, uh, but I couldn't get the button. I tried to press it but I couldn't, uh, get my fingers on it because I have some kinda gloves in my hand and they were plastic. 

00:32:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
 And I also have some kind of rubber over my eyes. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

00:32:20
 So, I really couldn't see that well. But, I finally got the button pressed and the door was going down. And as the door was going down, I pulled the rubber, got it off from eyes and I saw my husband walking up and like a bunch of guys with him. And he was dressed down like, just a shorts and a shirt, kinda like he's out and washed the car. 

00:32:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. 

00:32:40
 And it was nighttime and I looked out and my car, well I couldn't see my husband's face, but I knew it was him because of his body, because the door was going down. 

00:32:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right, you can see the bottom of his body,- (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
 Right. 

00:32:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

00:32:50
 So I looked out. Suddenly, the garage door went back up and I looked out and I saw my car sitting in the middle of the carport like he was gonna wash it and the water was running and everything, but the lights were on, for some reason, in my car. 

00:33:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Lights were on- (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
 Yes. 

00:33:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - in your car? 

00:33:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

00:33:05
  And so, I just said hi to him and, and then he walked to the side of the house like where the hose is- (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. 

00:33:15
 - to get everything going, and I looked on the carport and there was a chair on the carport and there was a girl sitting in the chair, and she was one of my friends from high school. And I said, "What are you doing sitting out here? It's dangerous, you know, you need to come inside." And she said, "No, I'm fine, I'm fine." So I said, "Okay." And so, I went into this house and it was you know, it's a large house, uhm, it wasn't my house but it was in my, you know, it wasn't my real house. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It's not your real house today,- (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
 Right. 

00:33:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - but you knew in the dream it was your house,- (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
 Right. 

00:33:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - okay. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
 So, I went inside and right inside in the garage is the kitchen. So I took the garage door and there's a door that leads to the kitchen. 

00:33:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Okay. 

00:33:50
 And, ah, my mother and my sister were in the kitchen and they were just talking on, we're talking about, but my sister and I kinda got into a disagreement or argument and my sister ran out of the kitchen and my mother was behind her. 

00:34:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

00:34:00
  And so, I went out after them. But as I was going out, I heard like a noise, uhm, it was kinda like there's a trash bag in the trash can and, like when you walk past it, you rub up against it, you get that noise. (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. 

00:34:20
 And the pantry door closed, so I looked around the house and I didn't see anything. I just did a quick look because I was, I was afraid,- (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. 

00:34:25
 - I didn't want to stay in, I just looked around and I didn't see anything so- (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

00:34:30
 - I just left out and then I closed the door because I said, "It's probably the serial killer and he's probably in there." So I'm gonna lock him, you know, in the house. So, uhm, I never really did talk to my sister about what was wrong, but when I went outside, I called my mom and my sister, and I said, "Someone's, in you know, someone's there in the house," and the door started to open slowly from the kitchen to the garage- (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
 - and in the crack of the door, I saw a man's hand with the gun, holding a gun. (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
  And, uhm, so then I called my husband. Well, my husband and his friend came from, like, from the other side of the house. And my husband was on the phone, and as soon as I saw the gun, I said, "Shoot him." But I don't say it out loud just felt, you know, said it in my inside. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III But it didn't come out of you or anything. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
 No, I didn't say it. I, I just thought shoot him, shoot him and I looked at my husband and then he started, his on the phone but he started reaching behind him like he had a gun tucked in at the back of his pants. And then, he pulled out the gun and he held it to the man's head. And then, I said, "shoot him" but I said it low because I don't wanna say it high 'coz I don't want him to look over and say, "Oh, shoot at him, he will shoot me- (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
 - you know, he will shoot me." So, I kinda whisper "shoot him" but he wouldn't shoot him because he was just holding a gun to his head. And then this other guy, one of his friends, that was sort of came up and held the gun to the front of his head, and I said, "shoot him, shoot him." Low, but you know, they can still hear me. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Can hear you. 

00:35:50
  And then he looked over at me, the guy with the gun that came out of the house, he looked over at me and then he pointed the gun- (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
 - at my sister and shot her and she just screamed. It, it kinda, it didn't really sound like a gunshot. It kinda sounded like a firecracker. And she went, "Aww, aww" and she fell. And then, he shot her again and she said, "Awww," and then she was just down, but it wasn't like she was dead or anything. 

00:36:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Like she'd been hurt. 

00:36:15
 Right, like she didn't hurt. (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

00:36:15
 And then, my mom run up to his face and saying, "Leave us alone. Get out of here." And I can see that the man's face, you know, who, the serial killer, I thought I couldn't see his face 'coz I was so afraid. (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. You were afraid. 

00:36:30
STEP TWO 

00:36:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Second, focus on the most powerful images, feelings or sensations of the client. 

00:36:40
Focus on an image, feeling, or sensation of the client 

00:36:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Try to help the client identify aspects of the dream on which you focus by being aware of counter-transferential feelings that are picked up from the client, changes in client affect that occur during specific parts of the telling of the dream,- (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
Counselor feelings? Changes in client affect Relationship to past counseling sessions? 

00:36:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - and sections of the dream that relate to issues, words, feelings, objects, stories or anything else that has occurred in the past counseling sessions. 

00:37:00
If possible, focus on one specific image to provide a starting place for exploration. 

00:37:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Following Ivey's recommendations, asking for a focus on one specific image will provide a powerful entry to interpreting the meaning of the dream. 

00:37:10
Focus on the image, feeling, or sensation of the client 

00:37:10
 And he had a fatigues, and he was just smiling, you know, he just looked right at me and he was smiling. But it wasn't that nice, you know, good smile. It was like a, you know, scary smile. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III A scary smile like in, like in movies. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
  Yeah. 

00:37:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III A scary smile. 

00:37:30
 Yeah, it was scary smile. So, and then I woke up, 'coz you know, I was afraid. 

00:37:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You're afraid he's gonna hurt you and,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
 Yeah. 

00:37:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - and (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
 And, and, and, when I close the door and locked him in the house, you know, when I said I don't want him to get out of the house- (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Good. 

00:37:45
 - I said, "Great, and I caught the serial killer and I don't have to worry anymore,"- (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:37:45
 - because, I mean, that's the reason I've, I've run outside to the truck to get the garage door and I told the girl to come inside because it was dangerous because of the serial killer. 

00:37:55
STEP THREE Help the client process the dream component in as many DCT styles as possible. 

00:37:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Integrate the SCDI into the flow of the session to help the client process the dream component through as many DCT styles as possible, especially leading to an understanding of the meaning of the dream component for the client. You can use a variety of techniques appropriate for each DCT level. For example, to facilitate Sensorimotor exploration - 

00:38:25
Sensorimotor Style Gestalt techniques 

00:38:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - counselors can use the Gestalt techniques of asking a client to repeat their last statement several times, asking the client to dramatize various images in the dream, having the client imagine the discussion between images in the dream, and helping the client focus on changes in body language. 

00:38:40
Concrete Style 

00:38:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Asking for a linear description of what happened in the dream can promote Concrete Processing. 

00:38:50
Formal Style Object Relations and Jungian free association 

00:38:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Object relations questioning and interpretation techniques and Jungian free association can be used to help the client identify patterns between dream components and the client's way he can experience it. 

00:39:00
Help the client process the dream segment. 

00:39:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And, and you said when you woke up, you were feeling afraid? 

00:39:05
 Uh hmm. I was feeling afraid, and it was kinda like a warm sensation right here. 

00:39:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

00:39:10
 And my heart was like pounding, pounding, and I was trying to like remember it and the more I thought about it, the more my heart was pounding, and the more I'm gonna- (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, you got to feel that- (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - even when you woke up. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You can feel that, that fear- (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
 Yes. 

00:39:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - right there in your chest? 

00:39:25
 Uh hmm. And, you know, I'm just very hot more, it's like, every moment's like a burning or something. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III A burning. 

00:39:30
STEP FOUR Ask questions at the concrete or formal levels to promote linkages between dream and waking situations 

00:39:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Questions can be asked at either the Concrete or Formal levels to promote linkages between dreams and waking situations. 

00:39:45
When have you felt this way before? 

00:39:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Immediately after you do the Sensorimotor or Concrete Processing, the counselor may ask if there was a time in the client's life when he or she felt the same way? This will bring the projection, in other words, the dream, into conscious awareness and discussion. 

00:40:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III I wonder if you can think of a time when you felt that before? Have you, if you ever felt that same feeling there and fear and that feeling in your chest? 

00:40:10
  Hmm. I mean, the only other time that I can think of is when I have a nightmare or would have been very afraid. 

00:40:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III When you've been very afraid. 

00:40:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III When, when is the time in your life that you've been very afraid? 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:30
  I don't know. The only time that I can think of is when, well, if I'm, when I was younger, if I was alone in the house. And actually, this is where, but when I was a younger, I used to think like, I used to, I used to happen on Sunday nights, I used to, I used to have that sensation and, and when it's, it's time for me to go to bed, my mom said, "Okay. It's time for you to go to bed." And I'd get that feeling. And then, I think, "Okay. This is the night that I'm gonna die,"- (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
 - which is like, when I was nine- (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You're nine. 

00:41:00
 - that I was thinking that. 

00:41:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And you have that same feeling inside? (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
 Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:41:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Huh. Looking back, looking back now, do you, do you know what was going on that may have made you feel that way, or what was happening inside you? 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:25
 No, I can't really, I can't really think of anything. I just know that, like, when I used to watch TV and things like that, I will internalize everything, like one other time when I was nine, there was this thing going on called the Atlanta Child Murders and I just knew that- (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Ah okay. 

00:41:45
 - tonight, it's gonna come and murder me and, you know, take me away and then, and when I think about stuff like that, I'm actually the victim and I think like, what is going on like the moment- (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
 - before this person killed him. What would've they done? Were they begging? Most people, I mean, I don't know what most people do but I think most people just think about, "Oh, okay, and when the child murder or so was kidnapped and killed". But I think about, I mean, I think the whole process of getting kidnapped, on my mind, getting kidnapped, getting taken to somewhere and just kill him. I wonder how they would kill him or things like that. 

00:42:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, most people don't think about it happening to them. They don't make it real for themselves. 

00:42:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And for you, it feels real. You can imagine it happening. 

00:42:30
 Yeah. 

00:42:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. So when you we're not (inaudible ), you remember being afraid to go to bed, that was the story that was in the news- (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:42:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - and that really affected you. What, what would that, what do you remember happening when you are going to your bedroom and getting to bed? 

00:42:45
 Uhm, my heart would beat fast and, you know, it was warm and I'll just be afraid and, uhm, it was dark in the room. And I will always put my cover over my head because I thought, I don't know, they won't see me and they can't get me if my head is covered, you know. And I mean, I don't know and, and I'll get headaches. (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You were only afraid to be alone in that room. 

00:43:10
 Yes. 

00:43:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Was that because- (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - what you saw in the news and you're not sure,- (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
 Yeah, and my sister and I shared a room because, you know, two different beds but we still share a room. And that was, you know, the strange part. 

00:43:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
 But, it was just so dark and I remember being so dark I didn't want to go upstairs to go to bed. I just hated it. I used to beg to stay awake. 

00:43:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Hmm. Did you, did you ever tell anybody back then what was, you know, what was going on, why you were so afraid? (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III That wasn't something you ever (inaudible [00:43:43.491]). 

00:43:40
 Yeah, I didn't tell anyone. 

00:43:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Can you think of another time that you, another time in your life that you felt that fear have begun? (coughs) 

00:43:50
  Not that fear, no. 

00:43:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Sometimes it can be, sometimes it can be a fear that's not as strong as that but it's similar? 

00:44:05
[sil.] 

00:44:05
  Before I was nine? 

00:44:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Could be, excuse me, it could be anytime. It could be, uhm, before you're nine, it can be recently, it could be any time of your life. (coughs) Excuse me. 

00:44:20
 Well, whenever something bad happened like in a war or things like that.- (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
 I get that feeling 'coz I feel like I can't do anything about it. But, and then if I heard something on the news, that's why I don't watch the news, what if I've just happen to catch it, you know. 

00:44:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
  I mean, I don't watch it at all so I'll never know what's going on. But, if it like interrupts a television show that I'm watching, I can't help but watch it. But, uhm, when I hear something bad, I just get really afraid. 

00:44:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III I wonder if, I wonder if you heard anything, if you remember hearing out anything on TV around the time that you have this dream. 

00:44:55
 Ah, the dream, the nightmare? (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah I, I think that you have this nightmare. 

00:45:00
 Yeah, I did. Actually, uhm, it was a, it was a report of a girl that was missing. I had a nightmare last night so- (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

00:45:10
 - it was a report of a girl that was missing. And she was in Baton Rouge and I said, oh no, you know, it's the serial killer again. 

00:45:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Oh, okay. 

00:45:15
 And she actually, they said that she called her boyfriend Monday and she had gone to a Dixie and that she was on her way home and went in her house and just found the bags. You know, they went into her house on Wednesday and she still have the bags but she was missing. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
 So, I mean, that's- (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Like in the past, it really affected you and you, you started thinking about what if that it was you? 

00:45:35
 Yeah. And, I mean, recently like even when I'm at the house, look at the window, I don't like to have the windows open because I, I read his profile and uhm, there on the Baton Rouge web page- (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
 - and they have the uhm, the serial killer's profile. So, I read it and it's like, he watches people and things like that. That's why I've never find(ph) him stroll(ph) because he knows there's scandal, so I was just like really, uhm, I guess kinda seen enough what, well, when I was walking from an elevator(ph), when I leave and when I get in my truck to leave, I get in the truck and I lock the door and then I'll open the garage and I back up. 

00:46:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:46:15
 And when I come home, I, I get all the way in and I close the garage before I get out of the car. 

00:46:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, it's actually in a dream when you're wanting to get inside. That's pretty normal for you- (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:46:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - wanting to make sure you get inside. 

00:46:25
 Yes. 

00:46:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  And, I know that in the news, there have been, there has been all this talk in the serial killer in Baton Rouge. 

00:46:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:46:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, this is something that's really been affecting you. 

00:46:35
 Yes. This is the second nightmare, okay, about the serial killer. 

00:46:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. So, you, it's something you think about? 

00:46:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You find yourself thinking about it when you're going around the community or when you're coming back home? 

00:46:45
 Uhm, only when I'm coming back home, you know, at night, uhm, and you know, not really when I'm, if I'm watched in the store. 

00:46:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. 

00:46:50
 I don't think about it. And, you know, I've, I'm just like, I guess happy if he'll look on and went to the store but when I come home, ah, I'll just make sure everything's secure before I even get out. 

00:47:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. Let's, let's go, let's go back. It seems that we make a connection, you know, between, like you said, seeing scary things, frightening things on the news, and connecting them, imagining what it would be like if it happened to you. Let's go back to the dream and see what other, you know, connections would you think. 

00:47:25
 Okay. 

00:47:25
STEP FIVE 

00:47:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  If the client chooses to continue to discuss the dream, identify and focus on other segments of the dream by repeating steps one through four. Try to keep the focus on one set of images and feelings at a time in order to illuminate clear patterns associated with each feeling. 

00:47:50
Identify and focus on other segments of the dream ....repeating the previous steps 

00:47:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And I guess I, I guess I wonder if, uhm, there was the sense that you couldn't, you couldn't or somebody else around you couldn't protect you from that hurt. 

00:48:05
 Yeah. Yeah, because like in the dream, I was saying, "Shoot him, shoot him," but they wouldn't shoot him. But they were just holding the gun up to his head and I, I, wanted them to shoot (inaudible ). 

00:48:22
STEP FIVE cycling back to step three 

00:48:22
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  What have you felt, when did you had that, well, let me ask you this first, what does that feel like? What does it feel like to be sitting there in a situation like that, which is frightening and, and having people who, you're, you're saying, "Do something. Do something." And, and you're sitting there and you must, uhm, you know, you don't have, you don't have the, the power, I guess and you can't(ph) do anything? 

00:48:50
 Exactly, I felt powerless and helpless and just like, well, somebody just do something but they wouldn't. 

00:49:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah, and it's, in it's ah, I can see in your face, so, that's something that feels really strong for you inside. 

00:49:10
 Yeah. 

00:49:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. What were you feeling at that moment as you, as you were saying that? 

00:49:10
 What? In that dream? 

00:49:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III I mean, you're talking about that, that- (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
 Or just (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:49:17
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You know, (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:49:18
 I don't know, it's, it's kinda sad and kinda frustrating because I've(ph) been, I mean, like I'd already know why all of this been, I've thought about this so I'm thinking that since I know about it, okay, let's move on from here(ph),- (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III If (inaudible ) 

00:49:35
 - it still shouldn't like... (crosstalk) 

00:49:37
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III But still, I guess it's still there. 

00:49:37
 Yeah. 

00:49:37
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III 'Coz it, 'coz it still comes up. 

00:49:40
STEP FIVE cycling back to step four 

00:49:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  I wonder when you felt this, I wonder when you felt powerless and out, and out, out of control lately? 

00:49:55
 Lately? 

00:49:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. Uh hmm(ph). 

00:50:00
[sil.] 

00:50:00
  Lately, it's been around(ph) like a time thing like uhm, have a lot of things going on right now,- (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
 - so, I feel like, I just need more hours in a day and I f, sometimes I feel like I can't do anything about anything because this is the way it has to be like. I have to do school, I have to do work, I have to do internship, I have to, I have to! 

00:50:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You have to? 

00:50:25
 Yeah. 

00:50:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, who's holding, who's holding the gun so to speak? 

00:50:25
 Well, I guess I am. I guess I'm holding the gun. But I have to, I mean, if I want a degree, I have to do my internship, I have to go to class, I have to work 'coz I have bills. 

00:50:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
 I has to do everything that I'm doing. 

00:50:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And that feels our control. 

00:50:45
 It feels our control and recently I have had like really bad headaches. 

00:50:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

00:50:50
 And I went to the doctor and she said that I have too much, too many things going on. It seems... (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Too much stress. 

00:50:55
 Yeah. 

00:50:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  So, is there ever, is there ever the sense that, uhm, probably the thought that you do, you wanna say to the people around you do something? 

00:51:10
[sil.] 

00:51:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Or, is it more of something that you're saying to yourself? 

00:51:20
 Nah, I think I'm saying it to myself. You know, I think I'm saying like I'm tired,- (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You're tired? 

00:51:25
 - you know, I just, nobody else can really do this except me. 

00:51:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Except for you. What is, what is, what is your thought about ah, about this, that in the dream; You, you were the one, you really the one sitting there without a gun, you were the one sitting there without power. 

00:51:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Like you, like you'd explain, like you've felt when you were a kid. 

00:51:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  How does it, on one end you're saying that, uhm, you feel powerless and it feels out of control because you have all these things to do. On the other hand, you're doing it. 

00:52:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, where is, where is the, you know, where is that, uhm, where is the, how is the powerless, this feeling come in there? Tie into that? 

00:52:15
 Uhm. 

00:52:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Does that make sense what I'm asking you? 

00:52:15
  Yes. 

00:52:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

00:52:20
  Ah, I feel powerless to change what I have to do, right now? I mean, I, I can do it, it takes uhm, almost all of my time, I have really no time really for just myself or just to relax. But I feel powerless to change that situation, that's what I feel powerless about, I mean, I know I can do it, it stresses me out but I can do it, but I feel powerless to change that. So, that's when powerlessness come to me. 

00:52:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. I wonder if there's also an anger there? You see, I, I wonder if, I wonder if in the dream you also had an angry or if it was more uhm, it was more the fear than powerlessness? 

00:53:00
 Uhm, it was more fear and powerlessness. 

00:53:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:53:05
 Uhm. 

00:53:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. So, when you see, you're saying, okay. 

00:53:05
 I mean, I was a little, and, and, you know, it was really like, I don't- (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

00:53:10
 - angry a little bit, that I have to do all of this. I mean, I don't have to do all of this if I want,- (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Well, if... (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
 - the things that I want. 

00:53:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You know, I wasn't trying to put words in your mouth. The reason I thought of anger is because you know, shooting, you're saying, you know, "Shoot them, shoot them," that, that sounds like an angry act but it's also protecting- (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - if you're afraid. 

00:53:30
 I was afraid. 

00:53:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You're afraid, too. Plus, you put a lot of pressure on yourself to, uhm, be perfect,- (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:53:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - to, to please, not only to please your father, but to, to, to reach all these goals that you'd set for yourself. 

00:53:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And I wonder if that feeling, if that feeling of having to be perfect can, can sometimes feel out of control? 

00:53:50
  It, it feels out of control because you know, like sometimes I make mistakes, I'm not perfect. 

00:53:55
 No. 

00:53:55
 But, it's not really a perfection that I'm trying to reach, it's a right way and a wrong way, and I have to do it the right way, you know, I have to do it right, I have to, I can't do it wrong. 

00:54:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III What if you do? What if you don't do it the right way? 

00:54:15
 I don't feel good. 

00:54:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III What do you do with that? What goes through your mind? What do you imagine would happened? 

00:54:25
 People will be disappointed in me and that, I don't know. 

00:54:30
STEP SIX Develop hypotheses on an overall interpretation. Watch for cognitive shifts. 

00:54:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Develop hypotheses concerning the overall interpretation of the dream by connecting the previously explored dream components' meanings. Watch for a cognitive shift experience for the client when a hypothesis feels meaningful to the client. 

00:54:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Well, I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about the, uhm, I'm not sure there's a connection here but this, what, what in my mind was, you talking about the serial killer- (crosstalk) 

00:55:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:55:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - and talking about how you want, you wanna know what his profile is, what kind of person his go after. You wanna make sure that you don't do something wrong, put yourself in a, in a, in the wrong place so that obviously you know, something doesn't happen to you- (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - and it sounds very similar to what you're talking about in your life right now that, uhm, you wanna make sure you do everything right or something bad could happen. In this case, disappointing people. 

00:55:35
 Uh hmm. Yeah. And that stuff, you know, just by myself. 

00:55:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
 I mean, even like before I graduated from college, the night before, I was, I didn't go to sleep, I didn't sleep at all because I was so nervous that I have my cap and gown and when I would walk up there and they wouldn't call my name. And I just, you know, be standing there. 

00:56:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

00:56:00
 I didn't know that I was gonna graduate until they called my name. 

00:56:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III There's a little bit of self-doubt. 

00:56:05
 Yes, they gave me the card with my name on it. They said, is this correct? Is this how you spell your name? And I still didn't know, I said well(ph), they just gave me this but it doesn't mean that I'm not gonna graduate and I said my dad, you know, came all the way here from Alabama and my other family came and I might, you know, they might not call my name. 

00:56:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It, It's, it's like, it's like there's a part of you that says "you're not gonna do it." 

00:56:35
 Yeah. 

00:56:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You're not gonna make it. And, and, and that part of you continues to create self-doubt in yourself until you actually see in a dream that, that something's happened. 

00:56:45
 Uh hmm. Yeah. It's, it's even like, I don't wanna get my Ph.D. but I say, you know, like how am I gonna tired of school and I, I wanna know about feels like your(ph) doing that for another two years but really what if I don't get in, you know, like, so, I have to (inaudible ) because if I do it, I don't get in and people will know that I wasn't good enough to get in. But if I say I don't feel like it, then it would be like my choice to not go. 

00:57:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III What would people say if, if people knew that you didn't get in, what would they say? What would they think about you? 

00:57:30
 Well, I think that they'll say, "Oh it's okay, you know, it's really hard to get into a doctorate program" but I think they would think that I wasn't good enough. 

00:57:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. So that, that's what you feel inside yourself that I'm not good enough and then you imagine that projection that other people are gonna think that about you. 

00:57:45
 I guess. 

00:57:50
STEP SEVEN Help the client process feelings and sensations. 

00:57:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Seventh, help the client process the feelings and sensations experienced as a result of the cognitive shift. 

00:58:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III How do you feel right now that you're talking about this? 

00:58:15
[sil.] 

00:58:15
  I guess kinda of sad because it's like the cat's out of the bag now because nobody knew that but me. 

00:58:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It doesn't feel like that, that's, it doesn't feel like that that conflict you're describing is something that's pretty, that it happens to in a lot of people. It doesn't seem like that, that's, that's very normal, whatever normal means? 

00:58:45
  Uhm, I mean, well I think about it I guess, but I really don't think about other people now or worry about myself. I don't think about, I know other people probably feel this way. You know, I think it's just all me, that's what I think. 

00:59:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It's almost like they know the cat's, now the cats out of the bag, people will see that you're not perfect. There's something, there's something going on inside. 

00:59:10
 Yeah. 

00:59:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And that in itself is another way that, that you might feel like you're a disappointment. 

00:59:20
 Uh hmm. Yeah. I just don't wanna let people down I guess 'coz it feels expectations doesn't mean sometimes I have (inaudible ). 

00:59:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It sounds like that your expectations of yourself are higher than those of people around you. 

00:59:40
 I'm just trying to, I guess, I tell myself I have to do this because this is what I have to do. Like I'm trying to meet a, meet everyone else's expectations but I guess they're high enough to check in or I don't know. 

00:59:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Oh, 'coz I thought that you uhm, you know about the expectation, when I see your work in the department, I think you have, you have seen. That I think you've seen the fact that these expectations that you always, you always do very well but it doesn't feel like that way to you inside, it doesn't feel that you're doing good enough. 

01:00:15
  No, it doesn't. I, I don't feel right now (inaudible ) I don't feel that I'm right for what I did, so it's my best that I could do to get, you know. At the time, okay, okay, uhm, yeah, I know I got this one wrong I'll do better next time but now at least we have As 'coz I was given As, you know like... 

01:00:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III What do I have to do? 

01:00:35
 Yeah, like gosh, passing? Yeah, you have to get a hundred. 

01:00:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So there is anger in there? 

01:00:45
 Yeah. There is anger I guess. Yeah, there's anger. Uhm, it sounds like I'm angry with myself because forget them, you know, it's like A. 

01:01:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III An A is pretty damn good. 

01:01:00
  Yeah. I've got an A+. 

01:01:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III A+, yeah. Then that's A+ (inaudible ) 

01:01:10
 I felt it's like I did what I have to do. That's what I felt. 

01:01:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, that feeling of fear seems like that they're almost different levels. On one level, a realistic level, there's a lot of fear about serial killers out there, I mean, because it's something that's in the news. And at another level, it seems the time is feeling about being in control, the feeling that you needed to do more to protect yourself uhm, and that feeling of fear right there seems to trigger all that stuff in you. 

01:01:45
  Uh hmm. 

01:01:55
[sil.] 

01:01:55
  Well, everything has to be a certain way this is how I think, for things to go, like how they are suppose to go- (crosstalk) 

01:02:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:02:05
 - you know, the time that's how they're supposed to go, I don't know but and I feel like that way and I can control things that I know if I do everything right things will be in control and then nothing will happen that I can't deal with 'coz I control things. 

01:02:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Which comes back around by the serial killer if I can control everything I'll protect myself, but if I don't control everything, I might, I might get hurt. 

01:02:30
  Uh hmm. 

01:02:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Or if not gonna hurt or killing you. 

01:02:35
 Yeah. 

01:02:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  What can you, we could, we just, we just brushed over a couple of the images from your dream but you could, if we had more time we could continue to go over the other images and you can do that on your own. You could journal about it. You probably, every figure in that dream you could look at and every image and take it like we're doing it. But I wonder based on what we've talked about so far, what can you do with that? 

01:03:05
  I can realize that people aren't perfect. I don't know. 

01:03:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III I wonder if you can say, I wonder if it's possible for you to say, "I can realize that Angela is (inaudible ) perfect. 

01:03:25
[sil.] 

01:03:25
  So what is that? That is so. (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It's hard to say that, huh? 

01:03:35
 Yeah. I don't, I don't try to be perfect. I just try to do everything how they are supposed to be done. 

01:03:45
[sil.] 

01:03:45
  And I have to do things how are they suppose to be done? So, I can't say, I have to do things hard, they are supposed to be done. But I have to, I mean. 

01:03:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Well, the dreams seem, the dream, the dream seems to be showing you how you're showing yourself in your dream that, uhm, that you've put a lot of pressure in yourself and there is a lot of anger inside about that. And there's also a lot of fear and I wonder if, if being aware of that can, can begin a process of trying to figure out what's, what's good enough, not perfect. Like an A is good enough or B+ is good enough, you don't have to be an A+. 

01:04:35
  I'm okay with A. 

01:04:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay, so an A is, but it don't have to be an A+. 

01:04:40
 All right. An A is fine. 

01:04:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III An A is fine. 

01:04:45
 I don't really want a B. But if I do get a B, I definitely have to have an A to balance it up. Definitely don't want a C. A is important to me 'coz it means that's a sign you're good. 

01:04:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Uh hmm. 

01:05:00
 I don't really want to make Cs or Ds. That's just me. I think that if getting A means is really what you're talking about, I don't know. When people say, you know, grades are not important (inaudible ) but you'll fail if you get a C, so grades are important. 

01:05:22
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You don't have to try (inaudible ) this is not really a (inaudible ) or not. 

01:05:27
 Yeah. You won't get into the Ph.D. program if, you know, I don't sound great in there. 

01:05:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III On the other hand, what I'm hearing from you is that if it's very either-or, either you're good enough or you're not. There's no place in the middle. 

01:05:45
 Yeah. 

01:05:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  And, maybe, maybe a place to focus on, maybe a place to keep thinking, a place to keep thinking about the focus on is where is the middle ground for you. 

01:06:00
STEPS REVIEWED STEP ONE Begin with a client generated dream fragment and use active listening techniques to help the client talk about the dream. STEP TWO Focus on the most powerful images, feelings, or sensations of the client. STEP THREE Help the client process the dream component through as many DCT styles as possible. STEP FOUR Ask questions either the concrete or formal levels to promote linkages between dreams and waking situations. STEP FIVE Repeat steps one through four. Keep the focus on one set of images and feelings at a time. STEP SIX Develop hypotheses concerning the overall interpretation of the dream by connecting the previously explored dream components meanings. STEP SEVEN Help the client process the feelings and sensations experienced as a result of the cognitive shift. PART THREE DREAM SESSION 

01:06:00
  So, uhm, I had a dream last night, uhm, actually it's the second time I had the dream and basically, I wake up in my room, I get ready and get dressed, took a shower, get into my car, and drop a little about an hour away from work. So I drive to my job, I park in the parking lot and I walk in and do all the work I needed to do. I put in my full eight to nine hours but I stay over to get some overtime because I stay, because there's always patients coming in and there's always transition. From there, my work is done, I get back in the car then drive and drive and be in (inaudible ) all the way. There's trees all over the place, you know, I'm driving down a single lane, I see trees everywhere. Uhm, just when I was about to get home, when I make a turn and I believe I got back to the parking lot at work. So I get to work, I'm always leaving work so I get all confused. 

01:08:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. 

01:08:35
 So I park in the parking lot again and I get to work. Go to work, put enough four hours with the work. (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Four hours worth of work. 

01:08:45
 Yes. And I would work again. The day's over, get back into the car, and drive and drive and pass the trees, pass on my way home, and make a turn just about to get home, I pull to the parking lot once again. 

01:08:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It's like a loop. 

01:08:55
 It's like a big loop. Now, I had this dream twice now. 

01:09:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:09:00
 And it's very stressful because I work 18 hours a day a lot of the time. I work for 12 or 18 hours, and then I work on weekends as well. 

01:09:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III What is your position there? 

01:09:10
 I'm Admissions Coordinator of the National Hospital. 

01:09:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:09:10
 And I, my job is to process insurance papers and, and private (inaudible ), the paper work and decide whether or not they're eligible to stay in the hospital or we transfer them to somewhere else. (inaudible ) charge of money and (inaudible ). So anyways, so I'm there all the time and then when I'm not there, I'm dreaming that I am. 

01:09:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, you can't stop thinking about it. 

01:09:35
 I can't stop thinking about it. 

01:09:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Now, if you put yourself in the dream and you imagine yourself driving in your car like what you're doing during that dream, is it possible for you to imagine yourself seeing your car just like in your dream? 

01:09:50
 Yes. 

01:09:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Can you tell me what you're feeling? 

01:09:55
 I'm feeling tired. I'm feeling, thank God, it is over and I'm going home. Uhm, I can't wait to go to bed. 

01:10:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Do you feel that in your body, too? 

01:10:05
 Yes. 

01:10:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Where are you feeling it in your body? 

01:10:05
 My back, my shoulders, my neck. 

01:10:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Do you feel like tense? Or do you. (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
 Yes, they feel tense. They feel tense about like in my mind I'm anticipating that I go home. When I go home, change into something more comfortable, shorts and t-shirt, and just go to bed. 

01:10:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Do you feel this tension from this intense pace and you're ready to get home and- (crosstalk) 

01:10:30
 Right. 

01:10:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - just let it go and just relax. 

01:10:30
 You bet. 

01:10:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III But, when you're in the car driving, you feel that tension. 

01:10:35
 Right. 

01:10:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:10:35
 As well as, I'm feeling tension, but I'm also happy as I'm getting closer to home and releasing the tension that I'm feeling comfortable about it. I feel like I am getting there but then I make a turn right before I turn to my street, it becomes the street the last time I go to work, and tension is back and this is getting there, when I'm like so much better only to be tensed again, and confused. 

01:11:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. Just before you said that you kinda let it kind about you (inaudible ) is a, uhm, thank God I don't have to. 

01:11:10
 Right. 

01:11:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III But then you make a turn, and you'd get back again. 

01:11:15
 Right. 

01:11:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, you said you're feeling confused. 

01:11:15
 Right. 

01:11:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uhm, what is going on in your mind? 

01:11:20
 I don't like I'm back. I don't want to be there anymore. But I'm not sure as to how to go about looking for another job 'coz I'm never, I don't have a time off to look for another job, I'm always working. So I can't necessarily, I can't afford to miss a day because I only have Mondays for sick days and holidays and thinking about the future, so I'm really limited in terms of doing something else. And I don't even know what this I'm looking for. 

01:11:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, confusion carries over to not only why you get back to work but in terms of where do I go from here? 

01:12:05
 Yeah, yeah, I do. Because I sort of fell into that job, well a working job, (inaudible ). Uhm, but it wasn't anything that I sought to get, it was when I graduated from college that this is the job for me. It was a job that I could get a hundred grand and so I'm confused as to where I wanna go from here. 

01:12:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So when you got the job but it wasn't the kind of job that you were really excited about, that would really grab on to something that you would (inaudible ). 

01:12:47
 Right. 

01:12:47
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III And, and I wonder if you feel, 'coz I kind of, uhm, take this up when you dream, I wonder if it's something that you could, I wonder if you feel that that you're in a loop yourself, that's its almost like you're doing this like a robot without even thinking, you're just going to work over and over again. 

01:13:05
 Yeah' that's what the past year and a half have been like, just doing that, and I mean, don't think about anything else, it's just like a robot. 

01:13:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Like a robot. 

01:13:15
 I just get up, go to work, go home, get up, go to work, go home, that is me. 

01:13:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III What does it feel like to be a robot? 

01:13:25
 Empty. Uhm, I've lost contact with my social network. I don't hang out with anybody or do anything. All I do is work. The highlight of my day is going to lunch with my co-workers. 

01:13:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Hmm. 

01:13:45
 And I don't like half of them 'coz (inaudible ). 

01:13:52
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III That is pretty funny. 

01:13:52
 (Laughs) Yes, and that's the highlight of my day, and that's the social event, that, that 45 minutes. So, they don't give you a whole hour for lunch. You have 45 minutes. 

01:14:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. So, you don't even have time to get your (inaudible ) breath again. 

01:14:09
 Yeah, yeah. 

01:14:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III What's going on? 

01:14:15
 So, I'm just tired. I'm so tired. I don't want to do it anymore. 

01:14:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You just want to let it go, just like that (inaudible ). 

01:14:27
 Yeah, yeah, I just want to click(ph) the dot. 

01:14:27
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III But it feels like when, as you start to get home, uhm, you know from work, just as you thought you were getting past it, you turn back and go back to work. 

01:14:40
 Yeah. Wow, yeah, you. 

01:14:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Any thoughts on that? 

01:14:45
 I think it's interesting that whereas I wanted to quit the job, but I can't. And I guess just as in my mind, I came to a decision, this is what I'll do to quit and look for something else. 

01:15:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:15:00
 And getting towards that thing that I, I turn around and I can't do that. I'm not, going to stay with this job. It's secure. It's what I know. 

01:15:05
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Okay. You're comfortable. 

01:15:10
 Its there. (crosstalk) 

01:15:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You're comfortable. 

01:15:10
 Well at least, comfortable in a sense that there's a steady paycheck coming in. 

01:15:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:15:15
 Not in any other sense but if I were to quit, I don't have enough saved up to hold me up until I get another job. 

01:15:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:15:20
 And so I feel trapped. But I think its interesting, uh, the whole loop thing because this is like I want to go look for another job. I turn around, I talk myself out of it and then I tell myself, I can't do this because I need this steady check to come in. 

01:15:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So when you snap you're fingers, you know, when you snap your fingers, a few minutes ago, uhm, a few seconds ago, how does that make you change? What you were thinking before you snapped your fingers that you don't want to do this anymore. 

01:15:55
 Right. I don't know before right now I'm thinking about the snapping, I feel I'm like you know, I'm like suddenly I was aware of, in my dream, about how to turn around the whole loop thing, uhm, I don't know, for me right now just seems like a symbolic, uhm, manifestation of my wanting to do something that then just going back and in, the same route going back to the same job versus going to something else. 

01:16:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay, now, I'm wondering when you said that, can you think of a time recently where you've been sitting there thinking about the job, thinking about wanting to leave it, and you, uhm, in your mind, you turned around like that, you talked yourself out of it, you know, thinking about that. 

01:16:45
  Yeah, uhm, my sister recently told me about a job opportunity to teach at a local high school. Teaching was really something I was interested in. 

01:17:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:17:00
 Uhm, but I think it's coming up next week, as a matter of fact. And she said that, "No, just take the day off." And I can't take the day off. She showed me the time that it's available. Uhm, there's different schedule going on all day. Uhm, you know I, uhm, it's in a university, as a matter of fact. 

01:17:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:17:20
  And then there'd be principals from all over the area looking for teachers. Then she says, "Why don't you just go during lunch hour." She says, "I'll do this, I'll pick you up from work so I'll, you don't even have to waste time going to the parking lot. Coz it, coz that, that's to show us where the parking lot is. 

01:17:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Ah, yes. 

01:17:40
 There was time issues. "I'll park in front of the building. You just jump in the car. I'll drive you there. Turn in the application, your resume, jump back in the car and I'll take you." We got there 45 minutes from Auschmer(ph) to Zaegger(ph), it's not that far. And I, okay so, something that, I mean, considered doing 'coz I've got kids coming up next week. 

01:18:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:18:00
 But my concern is, what if I don't make it back on time. Then I'll get, uhm, I don't know, there's consequences to being late. 

01:18:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III It's very strict there. 

01:18:10
 It's very strict. The environment there is just so rigid. And it's strict more because of the patient care that's needed. 

01:18:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:18:20
 I mean, there's so many patients coming through. If anyone's not gonna be back on their shift on time, they're short-staffed. And those that are there are overwhelmed and overworked. And there's patients waiting to be admitted, and you really can't hold that up because, you know, the emergency situation. 

01:18:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Constantly you walk into that environment with the tension everywhere, you know, you can't help it, feeling yourself without it. 

01:18:40
 Exactly, exactly. So, so the concern is not necessarily because of some strict manager supervisor, they are strict, but with reason; the reason is because of quality care that we want to provide patients. And because of the seriousness of the environment, and all that is just too stressful. 

01:19:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III There's always a loop there that too what you're saying. On, on one hand you're saying that, uhm, how strict it is and how uncomfortable it is to you but then you kinda come around and (inaudible ). 

01:19:12
 (Laughs) Yeah. Yeah. You're right. 

01:19:12
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III I don't care. That was an easy angle. 

01:19:15
 Yeah, I think, and I think that's one of the reasons why I'm hesitant to leave because well, I'm not bestfriends with people there. I wouldn't want to see them in any more difficult situation that they're already in. 

01:19:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:19:30
 And by having one person leaving, uhm, it becomes that much more difficult. 

01:19:40
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III To the rest of the staff. 

01:19:40
 To the rest of the staff. We've got, we've got several, and there's a high turn over rate there as well. And there's people that, right now, we are understaffed as, as it is. 

01:19:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:19:45
  And, you know with one more person gone, makes it that much more difficult. And that's why I work long hours and knew that because there aren't enough people to go around. 

01:20:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III So, is there a, is there a conflict between caring for yourself and, and caring for other people there? 

01:20:10
 That seems to be because while I'm, I certainly care for other people, I'm not happy. 

01:20:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right, right. Can you think of a time in your life when, when you have, uhm, felt similar to the way you are feeling right now. The way you felt to or about something? Where in one hand, you wanted to stop or throw away, but on the other hand, kept running something and saying to yourself going back. 

01:20:45
  I haven't noted to my, deciding between wanting to do something that my friend, as now has something to do with my friend, I prefer to do that, versus a family obligation. 

01:21:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:21:00
 I feel like I had to do this. But what I really wanted to do is, talking about a football game with friends, but, I kinda, (inaudible ) parents and (inaudible ) instead. 

01:21:12
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Right. 

01:21:12
 Stuff like that, I guess. What I wanna do with the right thing in order to, like grandparents, their anniversary dinner in a restaurant, or whatever versus going to going out with my friends. 

01:21:20
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III When you're a kid, what's it like to come to something- (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:21:30
 I mean, yeah. 

01:21:30
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III - like that? 

01:21:30
 First, you had no choice, you just had to do it because you're a kid and you don't want people telling you what to do. 

01:21:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III You feel trapped. You feel trapped. 

01:21:35
 Yeah. 

01:21:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. So, I'm wondering if you, you've also described, why I used the word trapped this time, but you used the word earlier. I wonder if it feels similar now, in the sense that it's almost like feeling like a kid getting in trouble. If, if you can. 

01:21:50
 Yeah. It does, it does feel like a kid out of control, uh, 'coz that's the way. I don't have control. I feel like the situation is keeping me trapped. Not necessarily people themselves, the situation, and I think what scares me the most is, let's say, you quit and you don't have another job right now. If you go a month or two without a steady income coming in, I mean, you know, you don't get paid, you don't have rent, I'm evicted, so you have to go find another place to live, maybe with a family member or a friend, or something, I'm just, I don't know. 

01:22:35
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III But it doesn't, uhm, you usually don't have the time to look for other jobs. 

01:22:40
  Well, yeah, my sister gave me. 

01:22:45
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:22:45
 I'm looking forward to that. 

01:22:50
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:22:50
 I think, I think, absolutely, the time that I think the time you're working again try to do that next week, okay, next week. 

01:22:55
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  How do you feel about that? 

01:23:00
 Hopeful. 

01:23:00
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:23:00
 A little better, I guess. But at the same time anxious that I have 45 minutes in which to get over with it. 

01:23:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III (Laughs) 

01:23:10
 (Laughs). To get it done. 

01:23:10
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III (inaudible ) 

01:23:12
 Yeah. I'm sorry. So, yes. 

01:23:15
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Is there anything else in the dream that really stood, that really stands out for you? 

01:23:25
 I don't know, for any reason, the trees stand out. 

01:23:25
JOHN F. MARSZALEK III  Oh. 

01:23:30
DR. ROY SALGADO - is very vivid because the community is from the nurture, approximately the, the, two stems into the (inaudible ) area. 

01:23:42
JOHN MARSZALEK III Approximately the virgin(ph)- (crosstalk) 

01:23:42
DR. ROY SALGADO Approximately the virgin(ph)- (crosstalk) 

01:23:42
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Okay. 

01:23:45
DR. ROY SALGADO And so, the tress just stand out as I'm driving and feeling comfortable as I'm crossing the lane and getting rid-- go to my home and everything, and the closer I get, I felt comfortable and thus, the (inaudible ) was better. But then when I made that last turn, to go to my home, I realized I maybe return onto the parking lot, at the hospital. 

01:24:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III So, the last turn is supposed to be the last turn at the back door of your house. 

01:24:15
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. 

01:24:15
JOHN MARSZALEK III But when-- all of a sudden you make a turn, you're going back to the parking lot? 

01:24:15
DR. ROY SALGADO  Right. 

01:24:20
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:24:20
DR. ROY SALGADO It doesn't even make sense in the dream, because you're probably visiting work out- (crosstalk) 

01:24:20
JOHN MARSZALEK III Right, right. 

01:24:20
DR. ROY SALGADO - you got into the more (inaudible ) way but you might dream somehow it does. 

01:24:27
JOHN MARSZALEK III And how about-- yeah. 

01:24:27
DR. ROY SALGADO  And it's frustrating. But the trees aren't-- and the trees are taller than they are in real life. 

01:24:30
JOHN MARSZALEK III So the trees are, the trees are-- before you make the turn, before you make a turn that takes you back to the parking lot. 

01:24:40
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah. Yeah. 

01:24:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III What's, uhm,-- when you think about those trees, what comes to mind? 

01:24:50
DR. ROY SALGADO Well, they don't belong there. They don't belong there inside the parking lot, uhm, it wasn't-- I'm not sure (inaudible ). There are buildings around and there are paved streets and commercial- (crosstalk) 

01:25:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III Right. 

01:25:10
DR. ROY SALGADO - businesses. So, it doesn't make sense to me. I'm confused because I go from, like a wierd area into (inaudible ) area. 

01:25:18
JOHN MARSZALEK III Now, would it make, would it make sense if we wouldn't make the turn to go back to your house? Would the trees be there? 

01:25:20
DR. ROY SALGADO Yes, yes, coz I'm a little bit (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:25:26
JOHN MARSZALEK III Hey, you live in Bellwoods and the trees that you got there when you get back to your house. What would those trees may be? 

01:25:30
DR. ROY SALGADO Peace. 

01:25:30
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Peace. 

01:25:35
DR. ROY SALGADO That's right. No stress. 

01:25:35
JOHN MARSZALEK  And as you drive, the tress in the (inaudible )-- are you feeling that? 

01:25:45
DR. ROY SALGADO Ah, yeah. 

01:25:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III If, if you're gonna make a turn, before you make your turn. (crosstalk) 

01:25:45
DR. ROY SALGADO  Before I make a turn, yes, I can feel that. 

01:25:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:25:50
DR. ROY SALGADO Just before the turn, I can feel that. And as soon as I come across that turn, and I start-- I can see the last streets turn to my driveway, it goes away. 

01:26:00
JOHN MARSZALEK III So it feels like every time you go in a path towards what woudl bring peace and serenity, maybe you're off. 

01:26:10
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah. So, I guess like friends, we, for example, uhm, I would go to to this teacher (inaudible ) who drives to it and I feel happy with the idea of something new, but again, stressed out this within a 45-minute time frame. That alone, I'm anticipating major anxiety that I'm not getting back on time. 

01:26:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:26:35
DR. ROY SALGADO And then I haven't eaten lunch and then, it's how you put in, 12 to 18 hours of no meal (inaudible ). 

01:26:44
JOHN MARSZALEK III  So, you're gonna -- you're required to work full in 18 hours. 

01:26:45
DR. ROY SALGADO I'm required work eight to nine. My, my schedule is from 8:00 to 5:00 or 6:00 PM. 

01:26:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:26:50
DR. ROY SALGADO However, there's always someone that calls is sick during the evening shift or doesn't want to show up on time. So, they tend to ask the single people to stay. 

01:27:05
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh. 

01:27:05
DR. ROY SALGADO And so there's some that's kind of feel that they do their-- if you're single, they ask you to stay, "Oh you got no family go to, ah,-- you, you might stay in, ah, that full hours when this person comes in," or, the whole shift if, you know, they call and sick. And I, along with two other people get stuck all the time. And we're the, the newest or the youngest that we are, you know, we're, we're (inaudible ) putting a lot of hours versus somebody who's, you know, in their 50s, with families, they couldn't require that at them. (inaudible ) you are hungry. I mean, the fact that. (crosstalk) 

01:27:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III We know that hungry. What, what would happen if you, you said I'm sorry, I have plans tonight? 

01:27:45
DR. ROY SALGADO  Uhm, nothing because I am a good employee that you were echoed above and beyond the call of duty. So I wouldn't sanction in that sort of play. I would feel guilty about what was left behind in terms of, you know, are they were works, are they Asians waiting in the waiting area to even it's the hospital. And, ah, somebody in a situation which you're potentially dangerous. 

01:28:20
JOHN MARSZALEK III So, you're putting pressure on the-- you're putting on yourself. Yeah, I did take care of everything. Take care of everyone there. 

01:28:25
DR. ROY SALGADO That's until (inaudible ). 

01:28:29
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Uh hmm. It's something that has made you, that you-- I mean, something that you thought of before (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:28:34
DR. ROY SALGADO  Yeah. 

01:28:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III If someone's coming up and his job (inaudible ). 

01:28:38
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. 

01:28:38
JOHN MARSZALEK III  And so that, that's what, that's what, that's what can keep you from your peace and serenity? 

01:28:45
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah. 

01:28:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III The feeling of being, uhm, in touch with yourself? 

01:28:50
DR. ROY SALGADO  Yeah, I'd pretty much, uhm, because I think that's what stresses me out with not being the same with people. Always wondering of peace. 

01:29:00
JOHN MARSZALEK III  With a family. 

01:29:05
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah, with my family. It's always an issue. It's my (inaudible[01:29;13]). 

01:29:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III So the feelings that you have, the guilt feelings that you have, but not even work, are similar to the feeling as an adolescent when you go from habit or you got something or meet other people. 

01:29:20
DR. ROY SALGADO  Exactly. And I still have those feelings now, you know, when with others. I felt I'm looking other people now in a sense that, uhm, I would spend time with them or-- well, uhm, we get on work and- (crosstalk) 

01:29:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:29:35
DR. ROY SALGADO - and trying again, you know? 

01:29:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III It's interesting that (inaudible ). 

01:29:44
DR. ROY SALGADO  Yeah. 

01:29:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III It almost-- it reminded me about, uhm, you know, in a balance, the way it's trying to find, trying to find balance. 

01:29:50
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah. And it's hard to do. 

01:29:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Was there, there any time in your life that you ain't able to find work out? 

01:30:00
DR. ROY SALGADO  Never, really, has been in, in high school and college. I was always involved, some-- because I'd always had a job. I've always involved in (inaudible ). I've always tried to excel my score, uhm, trying and attending (inaudible ), tried to (inaudible ) with my family. So, I've always been busy. With something or another. So I've never been able to find the balance and relax. I'm always juggling five or six different balls at the same time. 

01:30:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III  So it's got into a point today where you got so much- (crosstalk) 

01:30:40
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. 

01:30:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III - that it's on, like you said, it's creeping in your dreams now. 

01:30:45
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah. And that's one of the reasons why I decided to come in counseling because of this stress and the disagreement (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:30:56
JOHN MARSZALEK III (inaudible ). 

01:30:57
DR. ROY SALGADO Exactly, exactly. 

01:30:57
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Well, what are some things you can do right now to try to, uhm, to take care of yourself? 

01:31:05
DR. ROY SALGADO I guess first of all, just, you will say now I've put down in my hours of work, to stay, you know (inaudible ). I'm going home, versus every single night saying, "Okay. Sure. No problem." Can you kiss the butt -- my brother says when I talk to them. My family couldn't (inaudible ). 

01:31:27
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh, yeah. 

01:31:27
DR. ROY SALGADO You'd probably like him. What it means to no problem. So, so, so they mock me and call me - (crosstalk)(inaudible ). Ah, sure no problem. It's like (inaudible ). 

01:31:34
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh, so I see this, too. 

01:31:34
DR. ROY SALGADO Oh, everyone sees it. 

01:31:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III Ah, okay. 

01:31:35
DR. ROY SALGADO And it's very obvious to every one so then, uhm, and everyone has suggested that I come here because for that reason, I can't say no. So, I beast start off by saying (inaudible ) every once in a while. 

01:31:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III So does, when you said work, they are the one intended to be- (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
DR. ROY SALGADO Yes. 

01:31:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III They're wanting to help you find something else. 

01:31:50
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah, yeah, yeah. My, my mom, my brother, my sister, every one, I mean, knows it would (inaudible ). 

01:31:59
JOHN MARSZALEK III  So, that's, that's something that you can, uhm, you can call that mom, to, to support of your family. 

01:32:05
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah. 

01:32:05
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. And, uhm, is-- would it be possible to take some time off work and, and new job search? 

01:32:15
DR. ROY SALGADO Unless I could, uhm, I could look into it. I mean, it's not impossible coz like I said, uhm, I know that worker, so they would, there would be consequences per se, for taking a day-off. 

01:32:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Uh hmm. Is there-- well, let's spend more time talking about what, what are some things you can do to take care of yourself and relax and, and, uhm, what do you want to talk about if a career option. Uhm, what I want you to do-- is there anything else in your dream that you wanted to focus on before we finish? Any other, any other, any other images or feelings or (inaudible ) that you wonder about? 

01:33:10
DR. ROY SALGADO  I guess just the presence of, uhm, the hospital itself. I mean, it just might showing up over and over and over again. Just that-- just the image of it and then how I felt when I came across the building- (crosstalk) 

01:33:30
JOHN MARSZALEK III (inaudible [01:33:32.]). 

01:33:30
DR. ROY SALGADO Here we go again. That, you know, wasn't in your path. Each trying on a new cycle. 

01:33:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III What did that feel up when you're pulling out of the hospital and, and- (crosstalk) 

01:33:40
DR. ROY SALGADO  An exhaustion. 

01:33:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III (inaudible ). 

01:33:48
DR. ROY SALGADO  Like here, I guess I've gotta be over it. And I remember that when my (inaudible ) feels that's in front me when I was driving and like, what is this, the dream versus reality? 

01:33:56
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh, gosh. 

01:33:56
DR. ROY SALGADO But, anyway, because I wasn't sure, I'd put it in the folders to work coz I wasn't sure whether it was real, you know, I hate to not put it in the folders where they were and have the reality. In my dream, you know, I can so take that risk. You got so confused in that, it got very blurred. 

01:34:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III  In the dream, does it? 

01:34:15
DR. ROY SALGADO In the dream. 

01:34:15
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:34:15
DR. ROY SALGADO And in reality, too. I mean, just, it just seems to roll onto the other. 

01:34:20
JOHN MARSZALEK III Ah, how did you feel that reality? 

01:34:25
DR. ROY SALGADO Well, the only difference about dreams and reality would be because of geographically, everything was exact and precise and that was that you go in and things in the way they are. But if I'm tired because I woke up having felt like I've just gotten out from work in my dream, so I put it in a full day's worth of work in my dream and even details like, you know, walking pages to the room and filing and entering it into computer and making phone calls and talking to that person. All that, and that's specific in my dream, to have to do over again. For real, it's very tired visiting 7 o'clock in the morning and here I am. I've worked the whole time I was asleep. 

01:35:00
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Yeah. You really, you really are letting go of work and all the tension when you get home and if you're holding onto it. I guess, uh, I'm finding a way to (inaudible ) would mean to let go over that from you. 

01:35:16
DR. ROY SALGADO Sure. You mean, peace? No stress. 

01:35:20
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Forget there's something else there because it's something that doesn't felt okay to do. 

01:35:25
DR. ROY SALGADO  Yeah, I know. Uhm, I guess I would also like -- I feel like letting people down. 

01:35:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III  And you came in that conclusion. Yeah. It's something that would be interesting to look out would be, uhm, you know, future talks with me, how, how, uhm, different ways to just have manifested in your life the, uhm, the theme of not letting people down. You know, how far it was bad and how, uhm, how affection other (inaudible ). 

01:36:05
DR. ROY SALGADO Uh hmm. 

01:36:05
JOHN MARSZALEK III You mean, myself? Something, something I'd be willing to look into. 

01:36:10
DISCUSSION 

01:36:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Looking, looking back at the time we had talked about your dream, uhm, I'm gonna (inaudible ) for you. 

01:36:28
DR. ROY SALGADO Oh, the dream cycle. One of the things that I think was very interesting was how the different elements of the dream- (crosstalk) 

01:36:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. 

01:36:35
DR. ROY SALGADO - really do represent some of my emotions and cognitions- (crosstalk) 

01:36:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:36:40
DR. ROY SALGADO - in, in life, uhm, just double-- the, the turning around, that, to me, was pivotal because something I was never really aware of. 

01:36:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III How it ties in all your physically turning around and how it tied in to turning around your mind? 

01:36:55
DR. ROY SALGADO Correct. 

01:36:55
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:36:55
DR. ROY SALGADO Correct. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this, and do this. Ah, no, I'm not gonna do it. And it's so, that's interesting to me. 

01:37:05
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. That's when you snap your fingers, do you? 

01:37:05
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. 

01:37:05
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:37:05
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. So, that was very insightful. 

01:37:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:37:10
DR. ROY SALGADO Uhm, I think one, one of your goal in this was just, the idea of what the trees represent to me, doing that in the session, or those trees represent to you? And to me, they represent peace and tranquility and calm. It's like being-- you live in the middle of the woods. And it's just the idea that that's gone, you know? I'm living there, it's gone because of the job that I have. So, that was interesting. 

01:37:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. and enjoy it because you haven't stay outdoor all the time. 

01:37:40
DR. ROY SALGADO It's the idea that in my dream, the trees are-- were actually tall significantly much taller than they are in actuality. These are pine trees, which are tall, again, and they are almost twice as tall, in my dreams. 

01:37:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh, that's right. That's something that you'd be able to get to. That's interesting. 

01:37:55
DR. ROY SALGADO So, to me, that was interesting, the, the height of the trees, is significant in that, you know, the trees are alive, represent peace and tranquility, where in my dreams are supposed to. But no matter how tall they are, they really is, is not there. 

01:38:05
JOHN MARSZALEK III Hmm. 

01:38:05
DR. ROY SALGADO So, that was interesting for me. 

01:38:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III That would be, uhm, that would be, that would be interesting to explore, too. What, what the tallness does. (crosstalk) 

01:38:15
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. 

01:38:15
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. Something else there, but you really when you thought of trees, you talk about-- and you can have some feel, that feeling. (crosstalk) 

01:38:20
DR. ROY SALGADO I could. I could. 

01:38:20
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Yeah. What, uhm, what are the things close (inaudible ) out for you? 

01:38:30
DR. ROY SALGADO One session, talking about the dream and talking about the emotions, I really felt the tension in my back, in my shoulders, in my neck. 

01:38:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh you showed it to me- (crosstalk) 

01:38:40
DR. ROY SALGADO (inaudible ) I felt it, which, uhm, was very interesting, how the body could remember things based on just images that you have in your head. 

01:38:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III Uh hmm. And it, it really does and it's a great way to, uhm, knock down to myself and forcing with other people that it really, it really does help whatever the feelings like, you've been driving the car and knows your way. 

01:39:00
DR. ROY SALGADO  Yes. 

01:39:05
JOHN MARSZALEK III And your body, and that remind yourself. Let me-- and let me-- my body, that's why I tensed, in my mind. Uhm, you really, you really, see that you were able to put yourself into the dream. When I asked, when I asked you if you can imagine yourself being there, you really were able to put yourself in there. 

01:39:20
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah, because it really-- it was a dream that, that plagued me for a while. 

01:39:25
JOHN MARSZALEK III You had it twice, you said. 

01:39:25
DR. ROY SALGADO  I had it twice, had it twice. And in actuality, uhm, I'm having more than twice. 

01:39:30
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Uh hmm. 

01:39:35
DR. ROY SALGADO And so, I think I agree with it for a good straight week. 

01:39:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh, really? 

01:39:35
DR. ROY SALGADO Yeah, for a good straight week, uhm, when the dream was happening. 

01:39:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III What do you have in this (inaudible ). 

01:39:44
DR. ROY SALGADO  Yeah,- (crosstalk). 

01:39:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III - gets it around and round. 

01:39:45
DR. ROY SALGADO Excatly. 

01:39:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III Do you really drunk drive every night for a week? 

01:39:50
DR. ROY SALGADO Yes. Yes, that was very stressful. 

01:39:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III Must have been stressful. Because you live and to realize you were dreaming, like you said, before you're tensed to your dream. 

01:39:55
DR. ROY SALGADO  Right. 

01:40:00
JOHN MARSZALEK III  Any, uhm, any questions about what I was doing and what, what I was asking questions, I was asking, are there, are there anything (inaudible )? 

01:40:15
DR. ROY SALGADO That's a silly question but, but the idea of you're asking questions as to what the different objects in the dream represented? That was interesting because-- and very effective because it makes, of course, me to think. 

01:40:25
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:40:25
DR. ROY SALGADO Things that necessarily put them (inaudible ) being to? 

01:40:32
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh, I see. 

01:40:32
DR. ROY SALGADO If I-- you're, you're questioning- (crosstalk) 

01:40:32
JOHN MARSZALEK III Right. 

01:40:32
DR. ROY SALGADO - I was forced to assign (inaudible ) to. 

01:40:37
JOHN MARSZALEK III Okay. 

01:40:37
DR. ROY SALGADO And, uhm, it was interesting. 

01:40:40
JOHN MARSZALEK III You know, at the time it seemed the time together. 

01:40:40
DR. ROY SALGADO  It did, it did. 

01:40:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III And that's what you can do on your own. We can-- you can do that. (inaudible ) try to (inaudible ) together. How did you feel during, uhm, during the (inaudible ) itself? 

01:41:00
DR. ROY SALGADO I felt like the truck was helping me realize that my thoughts were irrational. And just talking about out loud, uhm, made me realize that, well, I do have choices and I can say they were or make decisions about how I want my life to go and I'm not tied into any one thing. So, I started to realize at some point that well, yeah, well, I feel this way and I think this way. It really doesn't make sense. It's not very rational. There's no real basis for my thinking this way. 

01:41:35
JOHN MARSZALEK III It's like, it's like, uhm, when you tied the feelings that you have in the dream, did you also a time when you're adolescent, you'd like those feelings seem to trigger this feeling and not being in control of- (crosstalk) 

01:41:45
DR. ROY SALGADO That's right. 

01:41:45
JOHN MARSZALEK III - (inaudible ) and you didn't have choices that you have when you're an adult. 

01:41:50
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. 

01:41:50
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. 

01:41:50
DR. ROY SALGADO And even as the kids, you know, as I was getting back as to the scenario, uhm, I had a choice then, too, to really say- (crosstalk) 

01:42:00
JOHN MARSZALEK III Oh, you did a choice. Okay. 

01:42:00
DR. ROY SALGADO That wasn't-- I mean, you go to (inaudible ) and define my family's wishes or combine. I don't want to comply but the choice was there. 

01:42:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III Uhm, I don't want to comply, that sounds, you know? 

01:42:10
DR. ROY SALGADO Right. 

01:42:10
JOHN MARSZALEK III Yeah. That's fine. 

01:42:15
CONCLUSION 

01:42:15
JOHN MARSZALEK III  In this video, you've learned about the DCT model and learned how to apply to dream analysis. You've learned about the four main levels of the DCT model applied to dreams, the general steps for dream analysis, and you have viewed segments of a dream analysis demonstration. Whatever approach works best for you and your clients, it is important to remember that it is the client's dream. What works with one client may not work for another. You might find that you prefer to integrate different combinations of theories using DCT. Whatever approach works best for you and your clients, it is important to remember that it is the client's dream, and that one symbol in a dream may mean one thing to one client and something else to another. I hope that you have found this video to be worthwhile and informative to your work with clients. If you are interested in studying dream analysis and DCT further, a list of resources is provided at the end of this video.
