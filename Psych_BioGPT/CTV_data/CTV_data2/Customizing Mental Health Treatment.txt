RICH SIMON So, welcome, everyone, my name's Rich Simon. I'm editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and welcome to this Networker Webcast. So in this series, what we're trying to do is to identify some of the primary factors that get in the way of effective psychotherapy, and until recently, we have a extensive scientific literature about psychotherapy and empirically supported treatments. Many practitioners have not found that altogether useful. These general truths often don't translate into the specifics of being, seeing a particular client. Our guest today is someone who's both a clinician and someone who's a researcher, and particularly someone who has managed to organize research and translate research in a way that can be useful to practitioners. So, join me in welcoming our guest today, John Norcross. John, welcome. 

00:01:15
JOHN NORCROSS Thank you, Rich, good to be here. 

00:01:15
RICH SIMON So, I, on the one hand, we're all familiar with empirically supported treatments. This idea that when there's a certain treatment approach that goes with certain disorders, DSM4 disorders, and that we're trying to match these treatments to these disorders, and then you like to quote someone whose work I was not familiar with, Sir William Osler, the father of modern medicine, I was just struck by your quote, so let me read this quote, and then you'll explain to us why this is relevant to psychotherapy. Sir William wrote sometime ago, he said, 'It is sometimes much more important to know what sort of a patient has a disease than what sort of disease a patient has.' Why is that, and how is that relevant to psychotherapy? 

00:02:10
JOHN NORCROSS Well, back in the day, and still according to the antiquated medical model, treatment should be customized to a patient's disorder, and as you just mentioned, DSM diagnoses have ruled the roost, but as every clinician knows, and certainly everyone who's gone under personal therapy him or herself knows in his bones, it is the presence and caring of the other that makes the difference. So I don't wish to pit treatment method versus the therapeutic relationship, but what I've been struck at is that most of the research is simply focused on matching treatment method x to disorder y, and as good Sir William said, that's an incomplete, clinically and scientifically, incomplete way of responding to our individual clients and their singular situations. So we're not throwing out the baby with the bathwater, we're saying there's more than treatment methods. 

00:03:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:03:15
JOHN NORCROSS To compliment empirically based treatments, we have empirically based relationships, and that's what's I've been spending my time on. 

00:03:25
RICH SIMON Okay, so what you've been able to do, and as I come up to speed on the research and the way you're applying it, and trying to offer the research, to translate the research in a way that's very, is user friendly for clinicians and helpful to them, so you have identified six characteristics, client characteristics that are particularly important for a therapist to match in an individualizing treatment. Have I gotten that right, and if so, tell us how you came up with these six characteristics, and then we'll go, we'll talk a little bit about what those characteristics are. 

00:04:10
JOHN NORCROSS Well, as every clinician knows, we're trying to match individualize or tailor psychotherapy to this individual patient. In the five decades of psychotherapy research, over 200 client variables have been investigated for our ability to match or tailor therapy to them. Over the decades, however, it's been clear that our attempts to tailor to some of them work, and others don't work. So starting about 12 years ago, colleagues and I have been conducting original meta analyses to discern which of these client transdiagnostic characteristics really make a difference. So, we've tried to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, and we're now talking about hundreds of meta analyses, I'm sorry, hundreds of studies, and we've been conducting meta analyses first, the first edition of Psychotherapy Relationships That Work about 12 years ago, and then just a few months ago, we released the second edition, and so from these 200 potential variables or client markers, there's six that exercise huge differences, and the way we've determined that is by looking at the studies, so let's take client preferences. Say for long term therapy versus long term therapy, individual format versus family work, psychodynamic, solution focus, humanistic, CDT. The typical study, the matching study, or in our research jargon, aptitude by treatment interaction, would ask patients what they prefer, half the patients would receive the treatment they prefer, and the other half of patients would receive the treatment they didn't prefer, or just what treatment is usual, and then we look at the end of psychotherapy to see how patients have progressed, so called outcome, be that defined by symptom reduction, goal attainment, life satisfaction growth. We looked at all those studies, and then we say, 'What happened to the people who received their client preferences?' And I'll just refer to my notes, because I don't have quite all this memorized yet, though it's getting there. Across 35 such studies, clients matched to their preferred treatment or role, were one third less likely to drop out of treatment prematurely, and the typical difference between those getting the preferences and not are quite robust, far higher, for example, than the typical difference between the treatment method. So if you want to talk about what should we be matching on, these are the six that the best research says, 'Pay attention, in particular, to these.' 

00:07:20
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's do this. There's alot of, this is alot of really interesting material, so let's first let's go through the six, and our emphasis here, for those of you who are, may be getting a little bit of that clinicians' allergic reaction, this is going to be alot of research talk. John is very much the clinician and very much in touch with the day to day experience of being a clinician and what's helpful to the clinician, so this is going to be a very practical discussion. So let's start, and we'll just briefly, you'll describe these six, and also we'll have John's paper that he co wrote with Bruce Wampold, in which he summarizes this, and that will be available to you on your, you'll be able to print out that paper, and there'll be a link right below the screen here if you want to consult that, but in any case, let's quickly go through each of these, John, and give people kind of the clinical picture of what you're talking about, and then we'll go back and then in a very practical, hand on way, we'll talk about how you help therapists to use this information in their treatment planning, how do you asses the characteristics, and then once you've assessed the characteristics, what you do. So let's, why don't you just take us through the six, let's start off with reactance level, which was striking to me, is that the, that has the highest loading of all these characteristics in terms of its relationship to outcome? 

00:08:55
JOHN NORCROSS That's right, it has the highest effect size, as we would say. 

00:08:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:08:55
JOHN NORCROSS And I promise not to traumatize anyone with research methodology, that's why we have papers and articles. So, reactance. Not quite resistance, because resistance is an interpersonal phenomenon between people. Reactance is rather a personality characteristic, cutting across relationships, and like all good human behavior, imagine it on that normal gaussian curve. So, on one end of the continuum you have the quite defiant, highly oppositional people, arr, yes, the pirates. Don't tell me what to do, shrink. 

00:09:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:09:35
JOHN NORCROSS Then most people are in the middle, you know, get along go along, and then on the other side, not to get too pathological, you have the compliant, who in a pathological extreme you may want to even call it dependant. And on the other side, of course, we have all kinds of axes to diagnoses for the defiant, antisocial, borderline acting out. Well, why does that matter? Because as soon as you realize you have a patient on either extreme, very different treatment methods work for those people. Now, every seasoned therapist listening to us, Rich, can already identify this, because early in their training, they found someone who was quite reactant, very oppositional to external advice, and they kept trying to pump away, so you have a bit of battle of the wills or a pissing contest, if you will, and then they said, 'You know, that didn't go too well. No that didn't go well.' On the other hand, if I had a quite dependent patient, seeking direction and advice, and I tried to wait them out, we'd have a very long therapy with little movement, so the match here is pretty easy. For the people in the one third who are high reactant, defiant, F you-types, if you will, then we know three things work far better. They are minimal therapist directedness, to emphasize that client's self-control, and if once ethically and practically comfortable paradoxical interventions, and as you know, that's the kind of people that the early paradoxical therapists worked with. Sal Minuchin, Jay Haley Erickson, these were not patients who were compliant and easily taken. On the other end, with the low reactants or more dependent patient, no one would be surprised to hear that therapy goes swimmingly when you, at least temporarily, you provide a little more direction, support, and advice. Now, I can hear virtually every therapist out there saying, 'Wait a minute, John, wait a minute. Don't I, therefore, just create more codependance by taking the high power route and being more directive?' Well, that's true, but the paradox disappears when you make the distinction between long term and short term. Patients demonstratively do much better when they're compliant, perhaps dependent by getting direct advice. After they secure some modecum of relief from their symptoms and feel better about themselves, then a secondary goal can be to transfer that responsibility and locust for therapy from less me as a therapist, more you as a patient. If you do this, therapy goes much better, drop out is reduced, and this is eminently teachable and learnable, at least in my workshops in about 40 or 50 minutes, it goes pretty quick. 

00:12:50
RICH SIMON Wow, okay. Okay, so let's, we'll come back, and we can talk more in detail about these various, these various characteristics and styles of dealing with them, but let's keep going, so the second category we're talking about is stages of change. So take us through this concept, and this is Prochaska's very well known work, is your primary reference for this? 

00:13:25
JOHN NORCROSS Yes, in fact, he was my graduate school mentor. Jim Prochaska, Carlo di Clementi and I have been working on this now 30 years. While they primarily work in the addictions, my primary interest is how this adapts to psychotherapy. So, in fact, this meta analysis was done by Jim, myself, and one of my students. So, just to review, briefly, right? We've got precontemplation, you know it as denial, the rest of the world, but that's a fairly offensive terms, and probably best not to begin therapy by insulting patients. Then we have contemplation, thinking about the problem, owning it, but not yet ready to go. Bridging contemplation and roaring into action is the preparation or baby step stage, and then from preparation into action, but we know it's just not action, but then maintaining, which then leads us to maintenance. So, the terms are nice, but different people require different things according to the stages of change. What someone needs who's saying, 'I don't have a problem.' is obviously different from someone in action saying, 'Help me change my behavior.' So that's stages of change, and that makes a huge difference. 

00:14:50
RICH SIMON So just briefly, just sketch out some of the, as you did when we were talking a moment ago about reactance level. Sort of on the spectrum, sort of general idea of how different, how you might adapt different approaches depending on someone's place on the stages of change scale. 

00:15:10
JOHN NORCROSS Sure. Well, with a precontemplater, more supportive, expressive, or motivational interviewing treatment methods tend to work much better. That's an obvious match, and relationship wise, we call that more of a nurturing parent role. Joining with the defensive patient, but also being at the cutting edge of their experience, because they're obviously quite frightened. Once into contemplation, where the person acknowledges the problem, but fearful or perhaps not knowledgeable about moving forward, suddenly we become more of a Socratic teacher. There's lots of exploratory, preparation, planning work. Once into action, the roar of all this, then you can imagine the treatment methods are far more active directive. Be that cognitive, behavioral, some Gestalt work, solution focused, and the therapist goes more along sort of an experienced coach. I have some skills to teach you, I've been through this way before, let me be your guide. Then once into the maintenance stage, we're doing some relapse prevention and consolidation, there the therapist role either in therapy or for at least one presenting problem in that therapy is like a consultant. Coming in, troubleshooting, seeing what's going on, and there, alot of the relapse prevention work has just been magnificent, so the stages are just a perfect encapsulation of this different strokes for different folks. 

00:16:55
RICH SIMON Yup, yup. Okay, so a moment ago you had taken us through this idea of preferences, and people coming in and having articulated a preference for treatment. Often, as we know, clients don't come in like that, but it occurs to me this is a really interesting one, because we're moving into a culture in which people are much more consumer oriented than being a patient oriented, so I think more and more folks are coming in for psychotherapy, they've done their research on the web, and this whole notion of preference then becomes a more crucial variable I think in beginning the therapy relationship. Do you see it that way, what's your experience in regards to this shift and this characteristic of preferences and patients stating a preference for a particular treatment. 

00:17:50
JOHN NORCROSS I certainly do see that, and there's some good research from SAMPSA and other national organizations that suggests just that. When I began seeing patients some 30 years ago, now. I don't like to think that far back. 

00:18:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:18:05
JOHN NORCROSS Hardly any patients would come in and tell me the type of therapy, the length of therapy, or my role that they would prefer. We are, indeed, in a consumer driven environment, and government likes to see that, as a matter of fact. President Obama's health care initiatives, and even President Bush's new commission on mental health call this an outcome driven, consumer oriented approach, so people will come in, and they have done their homework, and that may, for me, represent one of the largest sea changes I've experienced in psychotherapy. Back in the day, people used to ask during a hiring interview or for interns or for employment, 'How directive of a therapist are you?' And then we used to tell them how we personally are. Today, the answer, probably the best answer, certainly the most evidence based response is how directive I am depends upon the client. That's a huge difference in perspective. 

00:19:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. And your whole concept of the evidence based relationship is really bringing a science to bear on the understanding that in a more systemic understanding of how therapy actually works. So, alright, we'll come back to each of these and give people more examples, but let's stay with getting with the characteristics. So this fourth characteristic is called culture, say a little bit about what you mean by culture, and how does that figure in psychotherapy? 

00:19:50
JOHN NORCROSS Sure, well, of course, we've all been striving to become more culturally competent the last several decades. Here we mean culture in a broader way, just not referring to race and ethnicity, but also potentially sexual orientation, disability status, and so forth. You know, for the last couple decades we've largely heard that cultural sensitivity is an ethical imperative, and a human drive. 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON That's right, yeah. 

00:20:20
JOHN NORCROSS In addition to those, we now know it's an evidence based practice to culturally accommodate therapy works. It's not simply a political slogan, but when patients come in there's all kinds of ways to culturally adapt. Again, promising no research, recitation here. There are now 65 studies that have evaluated the impact of culturally adaptive treatments to traditional secular non-adaptive treatments, and again, that effect size of .46, certainly favors receiving client, receiving these culturally adaptive treatments, so culture works. How might treatment be adapted? Well, there's probably 10 or 12 different ways. Certainly language for people who are non-native English speaking, at least for me, metaphors, concepts, the methods, the content, the goals, the context of therapy. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So save a little- 

00:21:30
JOHN NORCROSS (crosstalk)All of this. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON We'll get to more of that in a moment, but just give us an example when you said metaphor or context or what would be an example of adapting a metaphor to a client's cultural background? 

00:21:40
JOHN NORCROSS Let's say someone comes out of the African American or black culture. What are they likely to immediately identify with? Now, we don't want to make the overmistake of assuming that we would know everyone would, because there's socioeconomic status, identity and so forth, but they're not likely to me immediately the metaphors you and I relate to. So, whether that's music, sports, family, talking about aunts, church, being brought up in a multireligious environment, I realize at times that my metaphors are just simply inapplicable. People, clients are very polite so that they rarely say, 'I don't know what you're talking about,' but we have those little awkward moments where they're going hmm, and then we realize they had no idea what the hell I'm talking about. 

00:22:40
RICH SIMON Okay. Alright, so we'll get back to these, so let's move through these last two, and then we'll circle back, and we'll give people perhaps a bit more hands on account of each of them. So the next one is coping style. 

00:23:00
JOHN NORCROSS Sure, and everyone knows what coping style is. These habitual, enduring patterns of responding to new or problematic situations. Again, to simply lots of research, let's take the externalizing versus the internalizing. As soon as I say that, particularly child and family clinicians will immediately say, 'Oh, we got that.' So right, for externalizing kids, like those with ADHD, acting out problems, we want more of a skill based therapy, whereas the internalizing, say a young adolescent girl with depressed, presenting with depression, we want more of an insight oriented, expressive therapy. And that's exactly what the child literature suggests, but that's also now true for adults, as well. For the internalizers, we want more of a skill based therapy, whereas for the internalizer, the introverts and so forth, we want more of an interpersonal and insight oriented treatment. All effective therapies work to, all effective therapies we want to apply, to paraphrase Freud, but we want to use it at the right time for the right person. 

00:24:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:24:20
JOHN NORCROSS More skills based CDT for the externalizing, more interpersonal, expressive, insight for the internalizing. Large differences in success there, Rich. 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON Okay, so the last one, this last category came as a bit of a surprise to me, and may undoubtedly says a little bit more about me than my understanding of the broad population, but that religion and spirituality, here's our secular pursuit of psychotherapy, where we're very sensitive in bringing in spirituality, certainly any religious dogma or assumptions about religion into the therapy room, but you're finding that religion and spirituality is a key characteristic of client characteristic in terms of this phenomenon of matching the treatment to the client for effective outcome, so talk to us about that, if you would. 

00:25:20
JOHN NORCROSS Sure, well, it's continuing in this tradition of being responsive to where the patient is and what the patient brings into the hour. As we know, many clients will embrace a strong religious or spiritual viewpoint. The research is pretty consistent. They, our clients are far more religious on the whole than most psychotherapists, so most of us don't have that appreciation. Lots- 

00:25:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)There are types from our religion. We don't, that side. 

00:25:55
JOHN NORCROSS (crosstalk)That's right. We already have our soul therapy that we're conduction. So it turns out in this line of research that religious accommodative therapies have been compared to secular therapies, and sure enough, they work equally well, so whether it's a Christian accommodative, Jewish accommodative, Muslim accommodative, they work equally well in terms of the treatment success as the secular or non-accommodative therapies. 

00:26:30
RICH SIMON As long as it matches. 

00:26:30
JOHN NORCROSS Right, but now here's the fascinating thing, if you have a client who prefers the religious accommodative, then that works so much better, and moreover, if one looks at spiritual outcomes, feeling comfortable with a higher power, feeling more in tune with God, the religious accommodative therapies outperform the secular therapies while not sacrificing any of the symptom relief or other treatment gains, so you get not only the usual benefits of psychotherapy, you also get some religious benefits as well. A true soul therapy. 

00:27:20
RICH SIMON Okay. So now these are, and there are two, we might as well just briefly mention, there are two other clusters here that do not have this empirical support that these six have. These aren't just things that came out of (inaudible ) came out of your head, but there's data, and this is in this, the order that you've given to them, that's the effects size of each of these different kinds of characteristics, the relative effect size, and then there are two more that don't quite, as of yet, come up to the level of these six, and expectations and attachment styles, so can you say a bit about what those refer to, and then we'll move on to sort of more nuts and bolts account of what you've just described for us. 

00:28:10
JOHN NORCROSS Certainly, well, we all know that attachment is all the rage, and last year, your Networker did a fabulous issue devoted to exactly this topic. And the reason we categorize these is promising, but not yet demonstratively effective is there's just simply not enough research on them. In terms of how a therapist would intentionally match or tailor therapy on the basis of attachment style or expectations. We know both of these relate quite robustly and predict well, treatment success, for example, clients who come in with a secure attachment style do much better in therapy on average than those who have an insecure or detached or quite anxious way of responding. So that's evidence based, but we don't quite know what we would do differently, besides knowing that therapy would probably be a little more difficult, turbulent, and lengthy. Same thing with expectations. As everyone can immediately guess, clients positive expectations at the beginning of therapy correlate quite nicely with how psychotherapy proceeds, but we don't know what clients' expectations at the beginning of therapy would lead us as therapists to do. So they're very promising. I imagine when we look at this sizable body of literature in another ten years, they'll probably be with the other six that are indeed evidence based. 

00:29:50
RICH SIMON So you started off here, and you're saying somebody who has a foot firmly planted in both sort of research and practice that much of what you've systematized here, and you've given us some empirical support for is intuitively known to most therapists, we hope. So what is it, so people who are listening to this, and they're hearing us describe these different categories and characteristics, and they can kind of nod saying, 'Yeah, I kind of do that already.' What is it that the framework, when you teach this, when you give workshops or when you're working with your students, what is it, beyond a validation of the way lots of therapists already think, have you developed in terms of, or perhaps more systematically taking this way of thinking and then trying to use it to make sure you do better at psychotherapy? 

00:30:45
JOHN NORCROSS Well, there's lots of pathways to promote this effectiveness. The first one is to assess many of these at intake. So not to proceed through two or three or four sessions, and then to realize maybe this doesn't match so well. So we've done lots of consulting work with large HMOs on the West coast in which people are matched, say, to client preferences and culture from their very first session, and indeed, that increases client satisfaction, the length of therapy, and the gains they make, so we can do it right at the beginning, even before they see a clinician. For the experienced clinician, we suggest, we build in these quick assessments for these six transdiagnostic client features in the first or second sessions. So, when I do workshops, and as we'll practice in a moment, all these are eminently teachable, learnable, quite quickly asking a series of focused questions to get to the core of these, because not all clients, as you've pointed out, will have preferences, or their culture will not be that important to them, or they'll be in the middle of reactance, in which case these decision guidelines don't make a difference. I also emphasize, just make a plea here, to any trainees listening to us today, to not go OCD on us. They hear any one of these six materially improve treatments and success and also reduce dropouts, so on Monday morning, they're there with their checklist and my articles, and they're staring at them and trying to assess them all, and paradoxically they are hurting the very therapeutic relationship that they are trying to cultivate, so we suggest people take one or two of these, gradually incorporate it into their intake assessment, their first few session, and then guide therapy far more effectively. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:33:00
JOHN NORCROSS The biggest sea change here, as we mentioned earlier is not what is my approach, but what approach works best for the patient, now we've said that for years, that's our ethical mandate, but we had largely discussed that in terms of client disorders, DSM diagnoses, or the populations we work with. You know, I don't work with the young, or I don't do neuropsych assessment. I do couples but not individual work. We now should be saying, how can we individualize psychotherapy in terms of both the treatment methods and the therapy relationships that we advance? How can we adapt, individualize therapy to be as Sir William would say matching to both the disease and the person? 

00:34:00
RICH SIMON And of course, okay, so how does this work, then, if somebody really embraces the framework that you're talking about and tries to systematically apply that their practice, what begins to change differently? So some of it is in a more explicit way looking at these dimensions early on in the process, but we have our training, we have our repertoire, we have our preferred methods, our particular way that we like to do things, so what have you, what is it, what changes about the way that people who really take these results seriously and this framework seriously about the way that they approach the task of psychotherapy? 

00:34:50
JOHN NORCROSS Rich, we see all of what we've been discussing is building on the treasured competencies of therapists, not replacing them, but let's pick one, let's pick preferences, for the moment. 

00:35:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:35:05
JOHN NORCROSS In comes a patient, and at the end of the first or second session you might say, 'Well, between this meeting and our next, will you think about what you want from therapy, not only in terms of treatment goals,' most patients have already prepared a little talk for us along those lines, 'But in terms of how I can be most useful to you.' That may be the type of therapy, if they've been in therapy before, 'what's been most helpful or lease helpful in previous treatment episodes? Short term versus long term. Therapy versus medication, give it some thought.' And I usually give it a very brief psychoeducational, if it were, I've been trained to think of psychotherapy as an experience, not much as an explanation, so if I ever go more than about 30 seconds, believe it or not, I ask my trainees to throw me an apple, because I should be chewing on it. People won't believe that after I've been talking like this, but it's the way it works. So, I would then ask them all those questions, and if it seems clinically and ethically indicated, then I will try to proceed that way. So, if someone says, 'You know, in the past,' and they're so individual, they're going to give us so many different responses, in fact when I first started doing this about 10 or 15 years ago, every new patient, I just kept a little legal pad and wrote down what they preferred, and it was amazing the diversity. 'I want someone who listens and doesn't interrupt.' The very next new patient comes in and says, 'I don't want a parrot, I want you in there telling me what to do.' Every client who comes in and says, 'I'd like to be seen with my spouse or partner,' another comes in and says, 'I don't want that person in here.' For every one who says, 'I would like to be working with medication in addition to treatment,' I have another person who says, 'Let's please not run to medication until we give psychotherapy a chance. So it privileges the clients' experience. Now, that's not to say we just say, 'Well, whatever they indicate is a preference we automatically do.' We still have an ethical responsibility, we still have clinical judgement involved here, but if we were a little more respectful about how they know how therapies work best for them, we'd probably be alot more successful. 

00:37:55
RICH SIMON So what you're saying it, because I'm hearing it and I'm more the preconsumer era of psychotherapy is when I was trained, so the assumption in the old days, and if you saw the early family therapist, for example, they knew best, and so the clients ideas about what was supposed to happen in the therapy room seemed, for the most part, that was part of the problem, that they didn't really know, if they knew what was good for them, they wouldn't wind up in our offices, or that way of thinking certainly wasn't an uncommon way of thinking. So what you're saying is there's a certain amount of data that we should take those preferences, they're not so casual, they're not just free associations, to really take them seriously, they can be, if not followed to religiously and slavishly and ignoring other factors, they can be very predictive of what's going to work with that particular client. 

00:38:55
JOHN NORCROSS They're quite predictive, and now we have dozens upon dozens of good controlled studies that show just that. Now, I want to emphasize again, we don't advocate our responsibility, this is a cocreated relationship, that's what a relationship entails, so certainly people have asked for things that I'm uncomfortable with, and I don't think it in their best interest, but then I guess I've compared it in the past that when, during early training, many of us were encouraged not to inquire too explicitly or directly about suicidal ideation, this old fashioned idea that we may be giving the client the idea or promoting it. We now look back and say, 'Well, we think that's probably close to malpractice, these days.' So it's a bit like that for client preferences, and we are accommodating largely strong preferences, Rich, just not small whims, so when I ask people to practice it, I say, 'Do you have any strong preferences?' They are incredibly predictive, they enhance the alliance, they're heady, and it also helps people understand how psychotherapy is really quite different than most medical treatment, which you know has a paternalistic, take it or leave it, my way or the highway. 

00:40:25
RICH SIMON Uh huh, okay. So is there a kind of a more formal structure? You certainly have given us a model, a way of thinking about what we do, in terms of when you do your trainings, in terms of a more systematic way of preassessment for example. Are there materials, or more guidelines, ways of thinking about how to best match a certain kind of intervention with one of these client characteristics? 

00:41:00
JOHN NORCROSS Well, there's dozens of ways, and they're all detailed in the respective chapters in that second edition of Psychotherapy Relationships that Work, and I should mention, I've given accorded far too much credit for this. People need to know there's 20 new meta analyses in there, I only conducted two of those. Yeah, it's true I read the other 18 four or five times, but these are really some of the best people. 

00:41:30
RICH SIMON Okay, okay. 

00:41:30
JOHN NORCROSS So in fact, many of the people in this series on effective psychotherapy are primary contributors to that work. Such as Bruce Wampold, Mike Lambert, Jeremy Saffron, Miller, and so forth. 

00:41:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. Okay. 

00:41:45
JOHN NORCROSS And so a few, let's stick with for the moment how we might assess these quite rapidly. 

00:41:55
RICH SIMON Yes, okay. 

00:41:55
JOHN NORCROSS They can be in your client life history questionnaire, in fact one of my early mentors, Arnold Lazarus, asked several questions in the multimodal life history inventory describing what's the best thing therapists can do, what's the worst things they can do. Even something as modest as homework, I realized there's two types of people in the world, those who enjoy the term homework and those who deplore the term homework. 

00:42:30
RICH SIMON Right, right. Turns them to stone. 

00:42:35
JOHN NORCROSS Yes, so while we know when cocreated with clients, homework predicts how well people do, sometimes just avoiding the term homework makes all the difference in terms of sealing the deal. 

00:42:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:42:55
JOHN NORCROSS You can ask in the first couple sessions, as we discussed, and then per the work of Scott Miller and Barry Duncan, we ask about these over time. So a recent case, a patient comes in and says, “I'd like to be seen occasionally with my adult daughter.' I said, 'Well, I'm quite comfortable with that, we'll have to talk about some boundaries and confidentially, but if she's willing and the two of you understand how that works, certainly that could be part of it.' She immediately said, 'Am I so relieved.' There was a visible relief in her saying, 'My last therapist four or five years ago just said I don't do that kind of work, and I think it'd muddy the waters.' Now I certainly understand that therapeutic perspective. And since my original training was in psychodynamic work, I understand those extra complications, but they were the most moving, significant sessions, all because she knew what would help her. So let's not get naive and assume they always know what's best, but when you ask sensitively, respectfully about client preferences, they make a huge difference. 

00:44:10
RICH SIMON Okay. Now what does this have to do with, one of the things that we've talked about in a number of the webcasts we've done over the last year or so is the idea of getting away from the idea that every therapist has to work with every kind of client and every kind of problem. So as you, it would seem to me, one of the implications of what you're talking about here is that perhaps that the therapist would do alot more of referring out and alot more of deciding at a relatively early state, before things get bogged down, maybe this person would be best seen by somebody else, before there's a sourness in the therapy relationship, or there's some experience of failure that that client has experienced in working with you. So talk a little bit about that and the, and how this, the connection between this framework you're presenting and this idea of thinking, having a more expanded view of your role, as maybe what you do find, you're a matchmaker in a kind of therapeutic matchmaker yourself in your practice. 

00:45:20
JOHN NORCROSS When, that's a great point, and I tried to end virtually every workshop on exactly this point. You know, one of my pet peeves about most workshops is they never present the limitations, the caveats, the cautions, because of course, they've never had a bad outcome. So I put up a slide and say, 'Let's talk about the downside.' One downside is that we can't accommodate all patients, just by virtue of who we are, our human limitations. As I mentioned, Arnie Lazarus, an early mentor, had this wonderful metaphor of a therapist as an authentic chameleon. We can change and blend colors to fit most circumstances and color ranges, but even chameleons don't do plaid. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON Okay, within limits, yes. Okay. 

00:46:20
JOHN NORCROSS Right, so at some point, one will have to make a differential referral, but here it's not simply saying I don't work with children, I don't work with that disorder. Here, after a session, one makes a differential referral saying, 'Given your goal, your preferences, your stage of change, your reactance, and sadly your insurance coverage, here's someone, a couple names that I think you would work with wonderfully.' Honestly, Rich, I don't see that as any higher prevalence than doing other forms of therapy, because the next point, and literally the next powerpoint slide in my workshops says you can do more shades as a chameleon than you probably give yourself credit for. And in fact, there's an intriguing line of research in the psychotherapy literature that hardly anybody looks at, and that is what distinguishes the more seasoned, experienced therapists from the neophytes, from the beginning trainees, and you know, as we age, we get a little more relative, we're able to look beyond our simple preferences into what the client's preferences are, and how therapy may be relative to their stage of change, their reactance, their culture, and we become more comfortable accommodating them. So, yes, it is true, you are going to ethically, clinically refer some patients who you don't feel comfortable working with, because they're not within your range of competence. At the same time, and in no way contradictory, I'm encouraging therapists to think that they can be more differentiated craftsmen. Instead of treating everything like it's a nail because they only have a hammer, they can be distinguishing, differentiating craftspersons who have an expanded toolbox, so to speak. We do this all the time in our roles, and in fact, I like to just point to someone in the audience taking a workshop and say, 'So this afternoon and this evening after the workshop, what are you up to?' and sure enough, they'll say, 'Well, I'm parenting, I'm giving a talk myself, I'm going back to the office to see some evening patients.' So I say literally within five hours, you have all this specialized, differentiated roles, does that feel inauthentic or beyond your competence? And they say, 'Of course not.' And I say, 'Exactly the point. You are able to shift roles, you are able to adapt sensitively, you are, as Lazarus might put it, able to be an authentic chameleon.' 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON And so, and also, implicit in this is the idea of a course of development for most of us as therapists of being able to be more, rather than I do behavior therapy, you come to me. That's my speciality, like a medical specialist who does X-rays all day, that you're really presenting a kind of role model of a therapist and there's a certain challenge to it, but very rewarding about the way in which you can grow into a more effective practitioner by embracing the framework you're describing and saying, 'What can I do to expand my repertoire so when this client isn't, wants to buy what I have to sell, can I give them something more relevant, can I offer them something more relevant to where they are?' 

00:50:15
JOHN NORCROSS Exactly so, and that's benefiting both patients and practitioners. It benefits our clients, of course, by giving them services, and that adheres to the research that shows this increases the chances of successful psychotherapy, decreases dropout, and it benefits practitioners by saying well, you know, I just don't do individual and group therapy, I also do some systems work, and I just don't do, as you said, behavior therapy, I can also do some cognitive or narrative work. So, it does benefit everyone, but it also calls into question this need for more integrative therapy. Rather than be narrowly, rigidly trained in a single therapeutic tradition, we all now know we need more integrative therapies, whether you define that by the therapy format, treatment method, or the age. Now that should not get so outlandish that we succomb to narcissism and believe we are the therapist of choice for absolutely every patient, but we will find a balance, and by adapting to more patients, it helps them, it helps us as practitioners. 

00:51:40
RICH SIMON So, now, how does this fit, and let's shift a little bit here and talk a little bit about the science here of psychotherapy, so in our last issue of the Networker, for example, we were, we really took on this question of how can therapy get, is psychotherapy getting better, how can psychotherapy get better? And I think your work offers one pathway here. Given what we've been talking about, what is the contribution, what's the, of the empirically supported therapies, we have a vast investment, from government supported funding, and universities in this whole tradition of empirically supported psychotherapy, speaking just for myself, seems like that hasn't had an impact on the nonacademic, the vast numbers of therapists who don't work in an academic setting. So what is the, this framework you're presenting, how do you think about the particular, both the contribution and the limitation of empirically supported psychotherapy in this stage in development of the field. 

00:52:55
JOHN NORCROSS Well, if I may, Rich, let's take half a step back and start with a slightly different question. What leads to successful psychotherapy? Well, if we look at that question and parcel out the literally thousands of studies and the hundreds of meta analyses, the results are pretty similar, and they show that the lion's share of outcome variance, why people fail or don't, is the patient. After that, it's the therapy relationship, the particular treatment method, and there's a huge debate on this, everyone agrees the particular treatment method is from small to modest when there's bona fide comparisons, and then there's the individual therapist as a person. Okay? So thinking of this, as you notice, I like to call myself a scientist, practitioner, educator, that's a super hybrid characterization. I would say let's approach this by what we know works, and how we can improve the therapeutic enterprise. If we were to follow that research, what would we do? We would spend most of our time and money in psychotherapy focusing on how we can bolster the client's resilience, self help, and agency. So we would spend far more time doing that, but of course, as psychotherapists, we become therapist centric, and we focus on what we control. Fair enough. After that, we would say well what's the best way of aligning the therapy relationship, and that's, of course, the first half of our recent book. We would also say, what's the best way of cultivating and strengthening the person of the therapist, and we would also ask about particular treatment methods, but sadly 80%, we estimate, of federal research funds go for treatment method X compared to disorder Y. That's bad science, that's bad practice to do that alone. As I mentioned earlier, I don't want people taking sides here, and yet my research is always drawn into these debates. It's the debate are you on the therapy relations side or are you on the treatment methods side? I'm on the sides of everything that works, and obviously they both work, but I find it indefensible to spend 80% of psychotherapy training time and federal research grants looking at treatment methods, comparing them one to another, that exercise only a small difference in one particular method. Now again, let's not go extreme. We know treatment methods do make a difference, I'm talking here the particular treatment methods. All these fights, whether this is better than that. I would start in very different ways, and to truly be evidence based says one follows the signs, so that science should lead us to prioritize evidence based patients, evidence based relationships, evidence based therapists, and yes, part of that is evidence based treatment methods, we should be looking at all of those contributors and their optimal combinations, that's good science, and every practitioner knows that's good therapy. 

00:56:40
RICH SIMON So this framework, so in this larger picture of our profession and funding for therapy outcome research, what's ahead here, what are the trends, what's going on? Is there, this framework that you're presenting and the idea of evidence based relationship other than your enormous enthusiasm and your skillful explanation of your own work, do you have a sense that's having an impact, is any of these funding patterns changing? What can we look forward to moving forward, or increasingly in the future of people who are interested in a more integrative framework that these evidence supported psychotherapy is going increasingly determine reimbursement patterns both at the insurance company level and at government funding level. What do you see ahead? 

00:57:35
JOHN NORCROSS I see both occurring, Rich, just as you've explicated. The evidence based therapy relationships and these evidence based responsiveness are matching are catching fire. Here's an example. The federal government through SAMPA, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration runs a fine website on evidence based practices called NREP, the National Register of Evidence Based Practices and Programs, and historically that's all been treatment methods, this treatment method works for this particular disorder. Just last year, they said the research on therapy relationship and this matching or responsiveness had matured to the point that they have, for the first time, put this on their website. The sales of the book, the number of invitations to speak, the number of people using our book for training purposes recognize that there's a deep resonance in the training and practice communities, that you are evidence based when you're doing these things, when you're cultivating a relationship, when you're monitoring how care is going, when you're systematically matching to the individuality of the patient and the singularity of the situations, these are evidence based, so they are catching fire. For the second half of the both, they're catching fire within largely the tradition of evidence based practice, which came from medicine. Evidence based practice started in the United Kingdom. It started in medicine, it then went over to Canada, and it's gradually making its way to the United States in all fields. In fact, psychotherapy and psychology are rather late entries into this. They still define most evidence based as a treatment method for a particular disorder, and that's how largely the new healthcare's looking at it, and as everyone listening to us knows, that's how insurance companies have defined it. What we're trying to do is expand or enlarge this notion of evidence based that psychotherapy is different, it's a relational pursuit. It is at once, both a treatment method and a healing relationship. So please, when we talk about evidence based practices, let's look at both, a healing relationship and a treatment method, and not settle for just the old medical model that simply looks at people as defined by disorders. So notice, it's not either or, I don't want to get into the culture war. It's good evidence would look at all of this, but make no mistake, evidence based practice is a juggernaut. We just hope to be part of that juggernaut and to redefine evidence based in psychotherapy in more caring, human terms. That's our hope. 

01:00:50
RICH SIMON Okay. Sounds like a great place to end our conversation for this afternoon. Before we sign off, people who are interested in finding out more about your book and more about training opportunities, can you tell them where they might go, we, as part of the series, people, your website is on our fulfillment page, so people can reach you through that, but why don't you describe what kind of resources, both free and other kinds of training resources that they can find their way to? 

01:01:25
JOHN NORCROSS I'd be happy to. Free publicity is always appreciated by my publishers. 

01:01:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:01:30
JOHN NORCROSS Psychotherapy Relationships That Work is published by Oxford University Press, as we've mentioned, it's in the second edition, but Oxford has been just fabulous in saying we realized dissemination is what this is all about, so they've given us permission to publish the meta analyses and the chapters in concise form in two special issues, so it gets, the word gets out, as it were. So people can also look in the Journal of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy for this. As I mentioned earlier, some of this work is also nicely summarized in the National Register of Evidence Based Practices and Programs, if you can't find any of that, by all means, just google me, and as you mentioned, my webpage. I do give lots of workshops, I try not to list them, because then people are bugging me to try and sign up for them, but I'm around. I routinely am at American Psychological, sometimes American Counseling Association. I'll be at Jeff Zyg's brief, The Next Evolution of Psychotherapy conference presenting. I'm on the road, so if they can't find me, they can just drop me a quick email. 

01:02:50
RICH SIMON Alright, that's great, so for the, again let me refer people to the comment board, that all of them should be able to access on this page. Take a moment, crystallize your thoughts. What did you learn, what new ideas did you have? Importantly, what questions got raised for you, what connections did you make on the basis of listening to John present his work and his overview of psychotherapy and what works about it? This is a way we can, us individually, to put things into language, going to help us individually learn, and also start this group conversation. John has graciously agreed that he will look at the comment board, and if so moved, and were so moved, may well respond if there's a question or any questions that are relevant to the entire group. John, sir, thank you so much. This is, you're doing extremely interesting work, and as, clearly we need more scientist practitioners like yourself, teachers who are putting together these different domains of knowledge, and that's really, that's where the future of the profession is, that's really crucial to the profession. So my hat is off to you for the work you're doing, and thank you for spending the time with us this afternoon. 

01:04:05
JOHN NORCROSS Well, thank you for inviting me, and thanks for those kind words, Rich. I look forward to the comments and future contacts. 

01:04:15
RICH SIMON Great, well, that's it from the Networker webcast for this afternoon, see you next time. For now, bye bye.
