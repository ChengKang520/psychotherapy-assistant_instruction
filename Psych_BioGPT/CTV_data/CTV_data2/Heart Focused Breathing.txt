DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in the post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is Heart-focused breathing. I am a big fan of HeartMaths breathing training systems. Heartmath has developed a devise that helps with breath training, utilizing a biofeedback system that gives you feedback about whether your breath is optimal and restorative. But for simplicity sake, we'll just follow the steps below, knowing that with the right focus we can pay attention either using a devise or not. Let's practice together. One, notice any early warning signs of stress or strain in your body and acknowledge the feeling. Appreciate the sensation whether it's frustration, impatience, fear, confusion, intolerance, anger without any judgment. Just bear(ph) a witness. Now, focus on the centre of your heart and slow down inhalation and exhalation.

Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
