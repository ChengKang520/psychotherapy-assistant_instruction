Functional Pediatric Pain Sarah Hanley, PhD 

00:00:05
THOM PANCELLA Hello, welcome to MIMHTraining.com presentation on Functional Pediatric Pain. I'm Thom Pancella with the Missouri Institute of Mental Health, thank you for joining us. With me is Dr. Sarah Hanley. Dr. Hanley got her first PhD in molecular biology from Rockefeller University in New York and then in post-doctoral fellowship work at Duke University's medical school in North Caroline. She then got her second PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Missouri St. Louis. And has done an internship here with us at the Missouri Institute of Mental Health where she has helped create a program dealing with functional pediatric pain which she will demonstrate as part of today's program. Dr. Hanley, thanks for joining us today. 

00:00:45
DR. SARAH HANLEY Thank you. 

00:00:45
THOM PANCELLA So let's start with a little bit of background first in-- why don't you tell us what functional pediatric pain is? 

00:00:50
DR. SARAH HANLEY Okay. Well, this is chronic, ah, and or episodic recording pain in children and it's, uhm, one of the characteristic of it is that there are-- is not due to any type of medical condition. So typically, children will present to their pediatrician who will rule out that there's any kind of, ah, inflammation, infection, a biochemical problems, structural ah-- anomaly or disease process occurring but nevertheless, these kids are experiencing pain which interferes with their daily activities. 

00:01:20
THOM PANCELLA What are some of the types of pain that are common here? 

00:01:25
DR. SARAH HANLEY The most typical pain that children experience is recurrent stomachaches, headaches and also sometimes a skeletal muscular pain. 

00:01:35
THOM PANCELLA So, and a lot of children with stomachaches but, ah, what, what are we talking about here that distinguishes that from regular stomachaches. 

00:01:40
DR. SARAH HANLEY You're absolutely right. Lots of kids do have stomachaches but these are the distinguished by the severity, the duration and the chronicity of them. So these children are experiencing stomachaches repeatedly. And, uhm, the other thing that is interesting is that they'll have this severe stomachaches and they will be intersperse though ty-- intersperse typically though with periods when they are fine. And in 1999, and then again in 2006, a group of pediatric, gastroenterologist got together to try to create some symptom based diagnostic criteria for pediatric abdominal pain. And what they did was they did was they group together a bunch of different disorders, ah, including functional dyspepsia which is pediatric, ah, is functional pain in the upper abdomen, ah, functional abdominal pain which typically is in the, ah, area of the, uhm, umbilicus. And, ah, also functional ab-- uhm, functional abdominal pain syndrome which is similar but also occurs with other pains like a headache for example. And, uhm, irritable bowel syndrome which many people are familiar to-- is common in adults that, that occurs with changes in bowel movements and stool. Ah, and then-- an in order to be diagnosed with this functional abdominal pain then, one of these types of pain would have to occur weekly over a two-month period. In addition, there's another type of pain called an abdominal migraine which is a really intense pain lasting for more than an hour that typically is accompanied by, ah, loss of appetite, vomiting, ah, pallor, avoidance of sound or, or difficulty with, ah, light. And children who experience that would have to have that occurring twice a year in order to be diagnosed with, uhm, abdominal migraine. So these are the types of syndromes that occur and again, typically there are episodes of pain followed by periods of good health. 

00:03:40
THOM PANCELLA Let's talk about headaches too then it did-- trying to keep these distinctions going between the common headache and the, the-- what's you're calling the functional pediatric functional headaches. 

00:03:50
DR. SARAH HANLEY Right, and one of the complexities with, with headache is that most of us do experience headaches from time to time and so there is a tendency to minimize the seriousness of these chronic headaches. And, uhm, in 1988, ah, ah, the International Headache Society got together and try to kind of figure out what types of-- what are the categories of headaches and they came up with a system of categorizing headaches into tension headaches and migraine headaches. And the tension headaches were then subdivided into chronic tension headaches or, ah, episodic headaches. And the migraine headaches were regarded as being either with and or, or without and that would be, ah, sort of a changed in perception, uhm, in anticipation or before prodomally(ph) before the headache occurs. Ah, unfortunately, there's really been less emphasis and less information on how head-- what headaches are like in children. So whether or not the, the criteria that were developed for adults are applicable to children. And indeed, there are also people who say that this type of cate-- categorization is not, uhm, as meaningful as some others and some have suggested that we would better to think about headaches so occurring on spectrum. And at one end of the spectrum you would have headaches that have primarily, ah, autonomi-- autonomic nervous system involvements or symptoms like photophobia, ah, and, uhm, nausea and at the other end of the spectrum you'd have more, ah, muscular involvement and what we would typically think of is the tension headache where you might have pulsating pain or band-like pain. But to think of the-- of headaches as falling in a spectrum with those being the two endpoints, others have said that there should really be an emphasis on looking at chronic daily headache as a separate type of entity. And then evaluating headaches based on the symptoms, the duration, and the intensity of the headache. 

00:05:50
THOM PANCELLA Well, you mentioned a little bit ago that, that there's kind of a lack of data, ah, you got data-- go-- good data in adults and less data in kids and I think that, ah, that, that crosses here too. How common of a problem is this with children and adolescents? 

00:06:00
DR. SARAH HANLEY Well, the estimates of the occurrence of both, uhm, functional abdominal pain and chronic headaches is variable. And part of that is because it depends in a sample of children you're looking at. It depends on what criteria you're looking at, you know, what are you calling a severe headache. Uhm, in addition, there are, uhm, problems about whether you're looking at parent reports or child reports of headache or you're asking children to keep a diary of, of, of their pain or think back o-- over the last two weeks or the last six months, how much pain have you experienced? But there is some data and estimates sort of fall in the range of, uhm, 10 to 25% of children experiencing functional abdominal pain and between 5 and 15% of kids experiencing, ah, severe recurrent headaches. Now, there been s-- there's been some data out of Canada looking longitudinally and what that data showed is that 12 and 13-year-olds about 26% of them were reporting, uhm, weekly headache. And, uhm, when they look age-- again two years later, they had 31% of those kids reporting, ah, weekly headache. Ah, finished study looked at, ah, headache occurrence sort of 20 years ago and then again and found that there seem to be a really dramatic increase in the number of children who were reporting headaches. In addition, there's been a study looking at inner city African-American children of lower socio-economic status. And those children about 40% of them were reporting daily, uhm, headaches and stomachaches. So this is a really significant problem for children. 

00:07:45
THOM PANCELLA Ah, there's been an effort to measure cost again, this is something you see a lot with the adult population when you see-- you report, ah, a syndrome of some kind, you say, well, it cost society ex-- x-amount of dollars or their associated cost with this. 

00:08:00
DR. SARAH HANLEY Absolutely. And of course there are medical cost these children are high utilizers of healthcare. Uhm, they-- their parents tend to take them to the pediatrician more often and it's thought that about two to 4% of pediatrician visits are due to recurrent, ah, functional abdominal pain. And in addition, a lot of these kids were get referred to, uhm, specialist and it-- about 25% of referrals to, ah, gastroenterologist are thought to be due to kids with functional pain. And similarly, children with headaches often go to see the neurologist. There are also maybe subject to sort of invasive procedures that can be expensive and needless-- and evasive. Uhm, so there are lots of cost associated with medical cost, direct medical cost associated with functional pain. 

00:08:50
THOM PANCELLA Are there other cost? 

00:08:50
DR. SARAH HANLEY Absolutely. These children, uhm, have many days of absence from school. It's thought that every month there are a hundreds of thousands of days of lost school just due to headaches. Uhm, they also tend to participate less in extracurricular activities and this can impact their social lives too. Uhm, the parents also have, have cost. They have days of work that they miss attending to their children, staying home with them when they're not feeling well. 

00:09:20
THOM PANCELLA So if the pain doesn't have a medical basis, if it doesn't have an organic basis, do we call this a real pain? 

00:09:30
DR. SARAH HANLEY Absolutely. These children are experiencing pain but this can be one of the really confusing things about functional pain because often when families present to their pediatrician there's the typical treatment might be just simply to reassure them that there's no medical problem. And that can lead parents to believe that their kids maybe are not experiencing pain or just kind of faking it. But functional pain is real and it's not well understood. So it's thought though that these children may have a lower pain threshold and then perhaps link, uhm, sensations of pain with states of stress or tension. But definitely they're experiencing pain. Uhm, in the study of Canadian children they found three broad categories of factors that seem to be related to experiencing recurrent headaches. And they fell into to, ah, school related, lifestyle related and mental health related. And things that seem to predispose children towards headaches were, uhm, feeling that their parents had very high expectations of them at school or feeling that they were not achieving. And protective factor seem to be, uhm, enjoying school and, ah, feeling that they were, uhm, being treated fairly by their teachers. In terms of lifestyle factors, uhm, a protective factor turned out to be eating breakfast and the risk factor was, ah, trying to lose weight and having ever had a drink of alcohol or smoking cigarettes. Ah, in terms of mental health, feeling of-- protective factors are feeling positive about yourself, feeling generally happy and feeling, uhm, positive about your future whereas, risk factors included feeling sad or depressed, uhm, worried or anxious and feeling that, ah, that you had a high level of parental rejection. 

00:11:30
THOM PANCELLA You talk about peer pressure or any of that as well? 

00:11:35
DR. SARAH HANLEY Ah, absolutely, there are lot of, ah, you know, major stressors appear to be related to functional pain but in addition to that what is really come up in the literature is that minor stressor seem to, uhm, influence children's pain. So they will sort of the daily hassles, arguments with, with their family members, difficulties at school, uhm, and, ah, with teachers and peers. So those things will all influence kid's tendency to experience this, this type of pain. 

00:12:05
THOM PANCELLA So if the, the pediatrician's current approach is aren't necessarily working to-- towards treatment, what kinds of treatment choices are out there? 

00:12:10
DR. SARAH HANLEY Well, it turns out there are some really excellent treatments that not only are effective but al-- have a long-term, uhm, good prognosis. And, ah, individual element have been found to be effective and also combinations but this include, ah, cognitive behavioral approaches and psychoeducation, hypnosis and relaxation techniques. 

00:12:35
THOM PANCELLA Well, tell me about the hypnosis, how that is gonna help? 

00:12:35
DR. SARAH HANLEY Okay, uhm, well, hypnosis can occur-- can be with, ah, a, ah, trained therapist. Also what has been found to be effective is self-hypnosis so children will, will work with the therapist for a while and develop a hypnosis script and then they can work on their own listening to that and, uhm, and that's been found to be effective. In addition, uhm, guided imageries related to hypnosis but this is where instead of, ah, having a, a script or, ah, ah-- that is geared to a specific individual, it's a more general script that will, will, uhm, provide imagery around, ah, feeling-- conquering your pain and, and becoming relaxed. So, uhm, typically, in a hypnosis there's an, an early induction phase, a general relaxation is induced and then there will be suggestions for either, ah, healthy functioning, ah, ego strengthening and, uhm, pain reduction. And it's found that children are actually because they have such active imaginations, they're excellent candidates for he-- for things in the hypnosis field, ah, and they respond very well to this. 

00:13:50
THOM PANCELLA You also talk about relaxation techniques, I'm interested in hearing how you get kids to relax. 

00:13:55
DR. SARAH HANLEY Yeah, well, you can use, ah, again using metaphors often very helpful but you can do sort of general whole body relaxation, getting them to tighten muscles and relax them, also progressive muscle relaxation is effective with children. So helping them to really recognize that their muscles have tense states and relax states and this can help them then when they're experiencing pain to really mindfully relax their bodies. In addition, breathing is important and their relaxation breathing techniques that children can learn that help them to enter a more relax state and manage their pain. 

00:14:35
THOM PANCELLA And then I think you also talked about, ah, education for families. So what do the parents-- what do the families members need to know? 

00:14:40
DR. SARAH HANLEY Right, psychoeducation is important and cognitive behavioral techniques are effective. And these, uhm, psychoeducation is again a little bit la-- a long line of what I was referring to before. Parents need to know that their children are genuinely experiencing pain. But unlike the kind of pain that they might have when they have the flu where resting in bed can be helpful and help them to get better quickly, parents need to develop positive ways of helping their children to main their daily activities. So working on, helping them to develop distracting techniques or, uhm, uhm, activities that they enjoy doing. And also helping to model for them, uhm, positive self-statements and recognition that they don't have to think catastrophic thoughts that their pain is gonna on forever. 

00:15:30
THOM PANCELLA So what are the-- what is the long-term prognosis if these techniques are applied? 

00:15:35
DR. SARAH HANLEY Well, where they've been studied, they've been very good. Part of the problem is creating effective partnerships between psychology and medicine. So, ah, physicians need to become more aware that these techniques are available and effective and psychologist need to partner with medical doctors so that they can work with, ah, children to help them get better when they experience this type of pain. But it has been found that children, uhm, not only are they able to implement these techniques but they, ah, continue to get better overtime. One thing that will be really helpful is wa-- when finding is that a lot of these children have, uhm, other, ah, diagnosis so they might have comorbid, anxiety disorders or depression. And so ultimately, it'll be really important to sort of get a more detailed understanding of these kids and more, ah, targeted interventions. So those that me-- might benefit from some family therapy would get that. Those with an anxiety disorder would also get treatment for that similarly for depression. There's also a group of children who will simply grow out of their problem and get better regardless of whether or not they get treatment. 

00:16:45
THOM PANCELLA Well, you built a tool. You help build a tool here while you're at-- into Missouri Institute of Mental Health and, ah, I think it's gonna be a good opportunity to demonstrate how you've incorporated all of what you just been talking about into that. So tell us how to find them. 

00:17:00
DR. SARAH HANLEY Sure. 

00:17:00
THOM PANCELLA Tell us what it is. 

00:17:00
www.painretreat.net 

00:17:00
DR. SARAH HANLEY Well, I developed this website called Camp Pain Retreat and the address is www.painretreat.net. And what I did was incorporate all of these active components, these components that have been found active in helping children to overcome functional pain. So at each area in this website that is animated, there are something for, uhm, parents or children to help them cope with functional pain. So you can click on in animation. So for example if we go here to the headquarters, we find information for parents, this helps them to learn about mind-body connection, uhm, how to help their children cope, ah, things that, ah, activities they can en-- ah, encourage their children to engage in when they're feeling, ah, pain or, uhm, developing positive coping statements. In addition, there's some forms here so parents can contact me directly and, ah, have a email correspondents. They can share things that have work for them with other parents who are experiencing the same kinds of issues. Ah, if we go back and click here on the fireplace and we go to, ah, the area that has guided imagery. So here there's this se-- section here with the information about guided imagery. And then each of the, ah, bedrolls here has a different guided imagery script. And if you click on it there is a audio that comes up. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Think about a favorite place you like to go. You might also think of a place that you've imagined going to and would like to visit. It maybe easier to imagine if you close your eyes. 

00:18:45
DR. SARAH HANLEY So each of these audios you can listen to online but also children can download them to any kind of portable listening the-- device they have to they can use them whenever it's convenient for them, if they like to listen before bedtime or when they're out. Uhm, I tried to make this as accessible as possible for kids. And then the waterfall area has the progressive muscle relaxation and different, uhm, relaxation techniques. And again, you can click on anyone of the rocks by the waterfall and (inaudible ) becomes, ah, an audio that can be downloaded. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Try to tighten up all the muscles in your body at once. Ready. Take a deep breath. Scrunch up your face, squeeze your eyes close, wrinkle your nose and press your lips together. Crunch your jaw... 

00:19:35
DR. SARAH HANLEY So each one of those provides children with the opportunity to learn how to control their muscles and the difference between a tense muscles and a relax state. And then finally at the, uhm, whispering pines are some more, ah, downloadable podcast and each, each one of these pines has a different breathing technique which helps children to learn how to breath with their, uhm, lower abdomen which really will help to induce a state of relaxation. 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN First, let's get the hand of using our belly to breath. Pretend there's a balloon dangling in front of your face. You wanna see what's behind that. Blow out heart to blow that balloon away. 

00:20:25
DR. SARAH HANLEY And one thing I did was I included in each area three different exercises so that children can try them all, maybe find something that works best for them but there's lots of variation and different things that they can do. And then at the easel are downloadable, uhm, things that they can print out and use. There's a diary that with it that they can use to monitor their progress so they can see how they're doing at the beginning of their, uhm, when they first come to the, the website and then after practicing find out whether or not their pain has increased. And this can also help them to realize if there are any kind of triggers that are helping to-- that are setting off pain episodes for them. 

00:21:15
THOM PANCELLA Now, you had mentioned, I see in here a lot of stuff for the kids and a lot of stuff for families. You'd mentioned trying to link psychology with pediatrics, with pediatric medicine, how do you hope to do that? 

00:21:25
DR. SARAH HANLEY Well, one thing I've done is I've, uhm, contacted different, uhm, websites that have information about pediatric pain either headaches or, uhm, abdominal pain and have encouraged to provide links to my website. And, uhm, I'm also contacting different, ah, bloggers to let them know about the website. Just getting the word out. In addition, focusing on major researchers who work at, ah, major children's hospitals to let them know about this resource for families. 

00:22:00
THOM PANCELLA And then what about with schools? I have, ah, contacted, uhm, the School Nurses, ah, Association to, to let them know about this. And also some school districts in the St. Louis area.
