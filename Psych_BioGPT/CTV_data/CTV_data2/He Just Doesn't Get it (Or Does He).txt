Microtraining Associates Presents He Just Doesn’t Get It (or Does He?): Internalized Other Interviewing with Men in Heterosexual Relationships with Lyra Barrera Psy.D. and Robert Santos MFT The following is an exploration of Karl Tomms’ Internalized Other Interviewing. While this is an intervention that is used in many clinical situations, here we will focus on its use with men in heterosexual couples. The Internalized Other Interview will be presented by Dr. Lyra Barrera and Rob Santos in three parts: I. An introduction to theory II. A step-by-step demonstration of core elements with a heterosexual couple III. A full demonstration with an individual 

00:00:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA I’m Dr. Lyra Barrera, I’m a licensed clinical psychologist and marriage and family therapist, working in Los Angles in private practice primarily. I also do some teaching and supervising as well. Umm… I work primarily using postmodern ideas including narrative therapies, solution focus therapy, collaborative language systems therapies. Umm… And I primarily see adults, couples and individuals. 

00:01:20
ROB SANTOS My name is Rob Santos and I am a therapist and private practice in Los Angeles as well. I had a large amount of sessions with Lyra and I also work using postmodern and narrative ideas. I just mostly work with adult men and couples. 

00:01:40
I. An Introduction to Theory 

00:01:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA So, we’re gonna talk about some of the work we’ve been doing. 

00:01:45
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:01:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA That’s been informed in part by Karl Tomms' Internalized Other Interviewing. It’s something that we’ve come to realize is really helpful particularly with straight men and heterosexual couples. They way we’ve been using internalized other interviewing (inaudible ) and lots of different contacts with couples and individuals with straight and gay and lesbian couples it also great effect. Today, we’re going to be talking specially about interviewing men in heterosexual couples, because that’s actually a focus of what we’ve been up to and an area of interest for us. That’s… That’s really sort of developed really nicely. 

00:02:30
Competing Cultural Guidelines for Men in Romantic Relationships 

00:02:35
ROB SANTOS A lot of men who are attempting to be in romantic relationships and sustain relationships with women, I’m speaking primarily heterosexual men uh… are in this cultural bind, right that in this moment in history men are subject to a couple of different sets of instructions and uh… value systems related to how to be a man in relationship, right? Uh… you know, since the feminist movement and the decades thereafter men have, ah… many men have taken up ideals around having more egalitarian relationships, more coequal relationships, many men actually have robust interests in partners who are peers and co-deciders and for co-pilots in relationship. But men, today are still heavily influenced by you know, residuals are wrong words or continuing structures of patriarchal ways of thinking about relationship that uh… create a tremendous conflict of loss of (inaudible ). 

00:03:51
DR. LYRA BARRERA And one of the things that’s happened feels like after the feminist movement there were all of these sort of road maps for women in terms of you can have a family, you can be in a workplace, that all of these things were available and umm… and there hasn’t been a corollary for men, in terms of what kinds of changes then come relationally after the feminist movement. What does that mean by practically speaking, what does that mean about what now is available to men, if they can sort of not just show-up in the workplace and have that be an identifier, but also show up in relationship? They’re just aren't examples. So, like Rob was saying, they're faced with these two sort of binaries of egalitarian principles of relationship and patriarchal principles of relationship. And with… this is the men that we talk to are in a real rustle about that. They are really well intentioned; they really want to participate in their relationships, but they're total out of loss for what to do. 

00:04:45
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:04:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA And so some of what we’re doing fells like attempts to… to that. 

00:04:50
ROB SANTOS Right, the… the… the way these struggles can show up ah… are… are many. But you… you find guys having, coming into the experience of, she’s really unhappy and I don’t know what to about it, she is hard to satisfy, she wants me to talk about my feelings, but I don’t know how to do that, I'm just real… I just bad at it emotionally and just you know she is… you know sort of essential as gender, accounts come in like she is… women are better talking about their feelings and men aren’t. Umm… And so there is a sense of ah… being unskilled at relational interaction, relational practice that is really a problem for guys and hard for them to even know what else to do. And the… the… the argument that filters through to guys, the premise that they hear just on the culture and the assumption that they bring to therapy lot of times is I have to get better at talking about my feelings, I have to have more self-awareness, I need to know my feelings better, I need to know my own experience better, right? And the problem with that, it’s very understandable, but the problem with it is, it sim… it doesn’t do much to improve relational skills and relational ways of being in the… in relationship. Umm… So there is this… this message that guys have gotten from the culture that what they gotto do is get better at knowing their feelings and better expressing their feelings and it’s a… it sort of doubly-pressing for guys, because they're… they're having the sense of like, that’s what I'm bad at, I'm just not good at that and… and certainly there is no models for… for doing that and you know the… there is plenty of therapies that help guys do that you know look within and know your feelings and say what you feel better and honestly, the complaint that I hear from guys a lot is that it just feels like a grind, it feels like I'm way just way behind the game, like I’m… like I’m in you know in kindergarten and the whole things get away from me. And so, what we find so valuable about the intervention when I talk to you is that it actually switches the emphasis from becoming more self-aware to becoming more other way. 

00:07:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA And… And the reason that sort of folds in with postmodern theory is so beautifully we think is because you know one of the fundamental ideas in postmodern thinking is that people already have skills and knowledge and resources, they just have been sidelined, they've been marginalized by dominant discourse, they haven’t been brought forward ah… in any collaborative way, in any meaningful way so those things have just sort of in relegated to the shadows a little bit. And so, we… we’ve really found over and over and over again that men have so much knowledge about their partner that their partner had no idea the guy knew anything about it. 

00:08:00
ROB SANTOS And that the man himself didn’t really know he had. 

00:08:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA That too. So part of what's sort of really beautiful about what this Internalized Other Interviewing does is that it brings forward those skills and knowledges, and the bringing it forward it has an effect on the relationship, it has an effect on each of the people in the relationship and there is this chance for intimacy and being known and being connected that lines up with for guys who want an egalitarian relationship where we’re in this together, it… it has that effect. We found in our work that it has that effect rather than being informed by patriarchal ideas of a guy knowing himself and just saying what he needs and what he wants and a woman following along with that or a woman anticipating a guy’s needs. This… This way of taking, this way of being in a relationship sort of makes all of these egalitarian ideas possible. 

00:09:00
II. A step-by-Step Demonstration of Core Elements with a Heterosexual Couple 

00:09:05
ROB SANTOS The… The Internalized Other Interview practices is basically what it sounds like, you interview a person and a couple and you ask them to be the other person, right? So, if you’re interviewing Jack, the husband you’re taking to him as if he were Jill and you’re asking Jill questions through Jack. 

00:09:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA And… And part of the thinking behind it is that each of us carries with us experiences… experiences are the knowledges of the other, right? Those are sort of that we're saying in the beginning, men actually have knowledges and real connected knowing is about what’s important to their partner, about what they care about, about the history of why things matter to the person that they are with, umm… their preferences and their hopes and dreams, and those things just don’t get airtimes. So, for interviewing, let’s say Jack as Jill we get to hear all about those things from Jack about Jill. 

00:10:05
ROB SANTOS And the purposes for the participants are they become pretty clear. You know Jack immediately starts to have a sense that his wife, who he’d you tell you if you ask them directly like Jack what do you know about what she cares about something? I don’t know! As he ah… inhabits her experience, he realizes he has access to all kinds of information about her history, why she cares about things and how she makes sense of the world. So, the immediate benefit for Jack is that he has ah… a really rich newfound sense of empathy and connection to his wife’s experience. For Jill, it’s ah… it… it’s generally a very moving experience of feeling visible, seeing her can be very surprising to see that he has this awareness of her experience it’s… it’s surprising for them both. So, it… it… it’s value to couples work and… and sense of connection in their relationship is very suited. 

00:11:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA And… And you know one of the things I know that we see with couples a lot is couples come in and they’re having this really contentious period of time. 

00:11:20
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA That part of what happens is people get more and more escalated the more isolated they feel, a sort of we’re experience has been. So the more isolated you feel, the more misunderstood you feel the… the less you feel like anyone is in this with you, the more escalated you’re gonna get and part of what happens with this is a kind of pretty quick de-escalation and what women report when we interview men is certainly not feeling alone anymore. Right that the… the fight doesn’t have to keep happening because; oh, he gets it, oh he understands it. Now, they might fight about you know this so long how come you’ve been doing it anyway or something like that, but that’s understandable, but primarily there really is this sense of relief and calm that we’ve noticed happens after doing it. 

00:12:05
ROB SANTOS Yeah, for… for both people. 

00:12:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yes, for both people. 

00:12:10
ROB SANTOS You know guys having the sense of; oh that’s easy right? 

00:12:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:12:15
ROB SANTOS This… This feels really nicely into ah… a discourse that exists for guys of I'm action oriented, I’m problem solving oriented. This is actually a practice that couples can take home and that he can do that has this immediate effect of helping her feel more her and understood and it leaves him feeling like; oh, I actually know what to do now, right? It’s… it… it can be very, very you know, we… we think about taking it home and simply excited about it. 

00:12:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:12:55
The Interview Rob and Lyra will describe the components of the Internalized Other Interview. Each of the components will be demonstrated with live work throughout this segment. 

00:13:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA So, how do we do it? The first part is sort of setting it up with the couple. Ah… Here are the things that we want to make sure to hit in the setting it up. We want to do just brief instructions and a statement of purpose. We want obviously to get consent from both of them, we… we don’t wanna barrow(ph) into something without having it be okay with either of them. Ah… In addition to that we want to look after safety so give them each an opportunity to opt out at anytime. We wanna set up the witnessing role for her, if he's the one being interviewed. Umm… we wanna sort of create space for him to struggle and explore and speculate. 

00:13:50
Introducing the Intervention of the Couple: Demonstration 

00:13:55
ROB SANTOS So, what I like us to do now actually is take a little while to uh… have a… a kind of particular piece of conversation where mostly Alfred you and I will… will be talking. And uh… it… it’s… it's a little uncommon because I’m actually gonna ask you to speak as if you were Lucy, okay? You’re just basically gonna take her persona on for a while and I'm gonna ask you questions as Lucy, right? So, I just gonna say, Lucy what time did you wake up this morning or something? And you’re just gonna tell me to the best of your knowledge from inside her point of view. Does that make sense? 

00:14:40
ALFRED Yeah, sort of like pretending to be Lucy. I'm gonna pretend be her. 

00:14:40
ROB SANTOS Pretty much, yeah. 

00:14:45
ALFRED Okay. 

00:14:45
ROB SANTOS Absolutely. 

00:14:45
ALFRED Alright. 

00:14:45
ROB SANTOS Umm… Now, before we do that, ah… do you feel okay doing that? I get permission to go ahead with that? 

00:14:55
ALFRED Umm… Yeah, sort of funny, but we'll try it out. 

00:14:55
ROB SANTOS Yeah! You give it a shot? 

00:14:55
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:15:00
ROB SANTOS And Lucy do you have any concerns about that or… or does it feel okay to move forward? 

00:15:05
LUCY Yeah, that’s fine. 

00:15:05
ROB SANTOS Umm… You know you guys are in some conflict about this issue and uh… we don’t want this to turn into a conversation that starts feeling like scary or unsafe or he saying stuff about you that feels bad and you're just sitting there… 

00:15:20
LUCY Hmm… 

00:15:20
ROB SANTOS …right? Or if feels uncomfortable but you’re… you’re not feeling good about being in you know either case you both have the right to stop it at any time sort of raise the hands and say this just feels weird, okay? 

00:15:35
LUCY Okay. 

00:15:35
ROB SANTOS Um… But as, you know, if that doesn't happen we’re able to proceed you and I are gonna be talking and you’re gonna be just sitting and what I’d call a witnessing position, sort of like the witness. 

00:15:50
LUCY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:50
ROB SANTOS Just listen to what he has said, he has to say. Umm… you know there may be a temptation to say that’s not true or he has got it all wrong or to get preoccupied with; God he’s just, you know doesn’t get it! Try your best to just listen to what he has to say and accept that, that's… that's his understanding of you at the moment. Okay? 

00:16:10
LUCY Okay. 

00:16:15
ROB SANTOS And Alfred for you, please just know that you don’t have to get this right, right? This is not about being accurate or having perfect knowledge or having a very much knowledge, right? I’m just going to be asking you to speak from her point of view and do your best, if you really get stuck, you know, guess. You know just sort of see what… see what you would guess about her, what she would say, okay? 

00:16:40
ALFRED Alright. 

00:16:45
ROB SANTOS Does it make sense? And so, having set it up in that way we then move on to do that interview and the… and the key components of… of doing that or, at first in most cases, asking some kind of superficial questions to help him ease and to an understanding of her experience. So, like Jill where did you grow up? Umm… you know address… addressing him by her name obviously umm… establishing context for the… the problem so you interview her about her understanding of the problem and the background and the history to it. 

00:17:30
Easing In and Establishing the Context of the Problem: Demonstration 

00:17:35
ROB SANTOS So Lucy, where were you born? 

00:17:40
ALFRED I was born in San Diego in ah… I was born in Rady’s Hospital. 

00:17:50
ROB SANTOS Rady’s Hospital? I got you. 

00:17:50
ALFRED I think so, yeah. 

00:17:50
ROB SANTOS And did you grow up in San Diego? Were you raised down there? 

00:17:55
ALFRED Umm… Yeah. I was raised in San Diego, but I did a lot of traveling to Mexico especially during the summers. 

00:18:05
ROB SANTOS So, how long have you guys been married? 

00:18:10
ALFRED We’ve been married for a year now. 

00:18:10
ROB SANTOS Okay. Congratulations. 

00:18:15
ALFRED Thanks. It’s not going so well right now, but umm… but that’s why we’re here. We’re… We're gonna work on that. 

00:18:20
ROB SANTOS Sure. Lucy? 

00:18:20
ALFRED Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:25
ROB SANTOS Umm… Tell me just the… a… tell me one more time about this problem that you've identified between you and Alfred regarding holidays and birthdays and stuff? What… What’s the problem in, what bothers you about him? 

00:18:40
ALFRED Well, I think Alfred has been a really jerk lately. He has been just being I guess forgetful about special days and I come from a family that’s very affectionate and my brother always remembers to give me phone calls and to make sure that I… and I feel special in… in all of that, in all of my family you know always makes me feel special so I guess I… I need that from… from Alfred. 

00:19:20
ROB SANTOS This is… this a… And what is that… that… What are some of the practices that were done in your family that you are not feeling like you need from Alfred? What… what do they do to… Tell me a story, it’s a good example of those things that they used to do that feels like what you want from Alfred? 

00:19:35
ALFRED Um… For example, I remember that on special occasions like say my birthday, you know my mom would wake up, she would sing happy birthday to me while I’m still in bed, and she would massage me and she would, if it was a Saturday she’d take me out that day and we’d just celebrate the entire day, it wouldn’t be like just a few hours of celebration or a… or a card and here you go I was… it was just made really… really special. 

00:20:15
ROB SANTOS And then you proceed with an interview that ah… in our case you know this is… this is an narrative therapy intervention the most narrative solution focused postmodern and so we proceed with an interview of Jill ah… that's characterized by one of narrative ways of questioning, you know interestingly helps him, but implicit ah… looking after ah… except looking for exceptions, thickening, counter stories, pulling in lost histories of… of values, hopes and preferences, you know it's… it’s a… it’s a you know a… a rich possibility oriented conservation about… about the life that's dreamed of and we're trying to bring forward, experiences have been marginalized or hopes that have been marginalized. 

00:21:10
Bringing Forth a Life that’s Dreamed of – Eliciting Hopes, Preferences, and Exceptions: Abbreviated Demonstration 

00:21:20
ALFRED And… 

00:21:20
ROB SANTOS So that's a… that's an example of how you came to get used to birthdays and special days and special occasions like that in your family? And… And how do you… How do you feel like… How do you feel that just benefited you as a person? 

00:21:40
ALFRED Well, it’s ah… it's made me sort of come to expect that from everyone. 

00:21:45
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:45
ALFRED So now, umm… So now I… now that I’m in a marriage umm… I you know I've been accustomed to that. 

00:21:55
ROB SANTOS Yeah. 

00:21:55
ALFRED So I expect that from now, from people and… 

00:22:00
ROB SANTOS And… and how… How does it improve your life when… when that’s, that's how the people around you experience holidays or relate to holidays? How… How does that… How does that improve the quality of the life that you have? What does that do for you? 

00:22:15
ALFRED Well, it just makes me feel special, ah… like I’m important umm… like I'm being thought about and… 

00:22:25
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… Got you. So it helps you feel important and special and… and like you’re being thought about. Got you! So, Lucy, you know given what you've been telling me about how important birthdays are to you and how they’re ah… you know that you just have a long history of them being part of how you sort of feel important and… and ah… you know loved or looked after by the people in you life. It’s starting to make sense to me like how it might be a problem for you when you're married with Alfred and you doesn’t have those practices right now. Was there a time in your relationship with Alfred where uh… he… he acted that way, he sort of took up those ways of acting or… or maybe even had a better understanding was what was important to you? 

00:23:20
ALFRED Um… Yeah, definitely! Umm… When we first stated dating umm… he showed his nice affection, his love by giving me things pretty regularly. He… When I went to Mexico for six months early in our dating relationship, he was writing to me. I think almost daily and he was writing you know pretty lot of energy or enthusiasm into his letters being… being romantic and… and so, so I thought that was gonna continue and I thought that… that was his just natural way of being. 

00:24:10
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm…Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:15
ALFRED So… 

00:24:15
ROB SANTOS Got you, I got you. So… So there were times earlier in your relationship and times when he really picked upon the ideas that like say birthdays were important to you, you know can you tell me a story of a time when he… he was really in… in a… in touch with you know this way of doing birthdays that you prefer or what did he do and what are those… 

00:24:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA So then, once the interview was finished we do a debrief, and we do a debrief with each of them. The reason for doing it is to be able to really solidify and underscore and bring into focus the things that have come out of what's just happened. So, we’ll check in with her and ask questions like I was had to hear and anything in there surprise you and like what differences it make having heard it now and what difference might it make in your relationship, now that you know that he has this knowing of you? And so umm… so there's that piece and then checking it with him ah… and similar questions, anything in there surprise you, were you aware that you knew all that? Is this a surprise to you that you knew all that? And similar questions again about what difference might it make. So the reason we are doing this debrief again is to… to carry forward what came forward out of our room into their relationship, so that those things don’t missed, so it isn’t just ah… we had this lovely experience, but it actually gives them something to take out. 

00:26:00
Debriefing and Carrying Forward: Demonstration 

00:26:00
ROB SANTOS Alfred thank you for… for ah… taking the, committing the energy to really put yourself in… in Lucy's shoes, so… umm… I'd like to take a second now to ask you both a couple of questions about how that went and how that was? Umm… Lucy you've been ah… in this listening position watching Alfred speak from what his… his best effort to speak from… from your point of view. How was that? How was… How close did you find he was to your experience of this stuff? 

00:26:45
LUCY Yeah, I was surprised that he knew where I'm coming from. 

00:26:55
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… You’re surprised to see that? 

00:26:55
LUCY Yeah! That he could speak for me. 

00:27:00
ROB SANTOS Yeah, yeah! Sort of a… a… a little surprised or big surprise? 

00:27:05
LUCY A big surprise. 

00:27:05
ROB SANTOS A big surprise? 

00:27:05
LUCY Yeah. 

00:27:10
ROB SANTOS You know having this understanding of his ability at least in this instance to do that, where are you coming, what… what… what did you use to… what… what did you use to assume about his ability to do something like this? 

00:27:20
LUCY Well, he's very quiet, so when I tell him. Well, I guess maybe he has been in this thing and I think he's not when I'm nagging I’d hope. 

00:27:30
ROB SANTOS Hmm… Got you! So… So you’ve had an experience of him of he's not listening, he's not listening. 

00:27:35
LUCY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:40
ROB SANTOS And… And that whole relationship what we call nagging, right? 

00:27:45
LUCY Right. 

00:27:45
ROB SANTOS Or you know could… could (inaudible ). 

00:27:47
LUCY Yeah. 

00:27:47
ROB SANTOS And you know get your point across when you don’t feel like somebody is listening to you. So that’s, that’s where you might have had a sense that, I don't think he's listening. 

00:27:55
LUCY Right. 

00:27:55
ROB SANTOS Now, you get some surprise that… 

00:27:55
LUCY Right, right, yeah. 

00:28:00
ROB SANTOS So, what… what difference does that make to you ah… knowing now that he has this rich, he has this understanding of your experience of this issue? 

00:28:15
LUCY Well, I think we can move forward, I mean I guess umm… it helps to know that and now he knows where I'm coming from, so maybe we can find something that’ll help him and… and just validate me just really, it’s not really about spending money if that's what he thinks… 

00:28:40
ROB SANTOS Got you. 

00:28:40
LUCY …its more just about validating that I'm in his life. 

00:28:45
ROB SANTOS Okay. Got you! So what in particular did you hear him describe from your experience that felt like you really got it? What specific, which… which one or two specific things that you really ah… pursuing you know? 

00:29:00
LUCY Well, he said a lot umm… 

00:29:00
ROB SANTOS Yeah, yeah. 

00:29:05
LUCY I would say, I guess, he understood where I was coming from and that's you know where I grew up, how I grew up, knowing it may be your questions might have helped him with that. And he understood that I… I was starting to feel scared that he wasn’t interested anymore. 

00:29:30
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… And that, that felt like a… a specific… 

00:29:35
LUCY Right. 

00:29:35
ROB SANTOS …ah… piece of your experience that… that you got? 

00:29:35
LUCY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:40
ROB SANTOS And… And what… what does it mean to you or what effect does that have for you to… to know that he’s aware of that… that he… he sees that that’s your worry? 

00:29:50
LUCY Well, then I guess he would know how to act upon that, now he’s not oblivious to know that his actions are telling me, if he really wants to be, because I’m investing this time and effort in him. So now, he knows that. 

00:30:05
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:05
LUCY It’s… It’s you know though there is an end there, if… if he continued and I would have believed that he even loved me and… 

00:30:10
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… Hmm… Sure. Okay. We’d see that he gets that and that might actually effect how he moves forward… 

00:30:20
LUCY Right. 

00:30:20
ROB SANTOS …from here. Got you, okay, okay. And so, Alfred uh… any surprises in going through that exercise? 

00:30:35
ALFRED Hmm… Yeah, some of the questions that you asked that hadn’t we thought about, hadn’t reflected on some of the things. 

00:30:45
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:50
ALFRED And then just being pretending to be in her position. 

00:30:50
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:55
ALFRED Sort of forced me to look at things in a different way umm… as I was describing them to you. 

00:31:00
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:00
ALFRED It was difficult, it’s hard sometimes to sort of organize what I was gonna say, but. 

00:31:05
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:10
ALFRED But ah… But I was surprised that I thought about some things that I hadn’t really… 

00:31:15
ROB SANTOS Yeah. 

00:31:15
ALFRED …thought about before. 

00:31:15
ROB SANTOS Okay. And what… what in particular was this thing about? 

00:31:20
ALFRED Umm… I guess particularly the way she feels when I uh… when I don’t put energy into remembering special occasions. 

00:31:35
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:35
ALFRED Uh… I then realized that she might feel maybe rejected or… or that I don’t have… or that I don’t have any interest in her anymore. I mean it's definitely not what’s happening that’s on the case. 

00:31:50
ROB SANTOS Sure, sure, sure! But you’re surprised as you sort of sat in her position to… to discover that, I mean that, that might be what that feels like for her. 

00:32:00
ALFRED Yeah, yeah. 

00:32:05
ROB SANTOS And… And with that… that sense that you had, now what difference do you think that might make to you going forward and how you? 

00:32:15
ALFRED Umm… Well, now that I have a pretty good idea of how she’s feeling, how she’s interpreting my actions. 

00:32:30
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:30
ALFRED I assume that I probably think twice… 

00:32:30
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:35
ALFRED …about umm… putting off plans to do something special, you know hopefully umm… that will help tomorrow we would need to… to realize that I’ve to set something up, something special I got… I got to pull the energy, creativity into it or… 

00:32:50
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:50
ALFRED …she might feel that you know neglected or like she’s not important, so… 

00:32:55
ROB SANTOS Now she uh… she shared that it was kind of surprising in a positive way to know that you had this understanding of her. How was that for you to hear her appreciation of you in that way? 

00:33:10
ALFRED It felt good umm… I guess we’ve been doing a little bit of arguing… arguing recently so there haven’t been too many appreciations going… 

00:33:25
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:25
ALFRED …around so I felt refreshing and nice to hear something positive from her umm… and the compliment. 

00:33:35
ROB SANTOS Well, okay. Uh… That was uh… uh… very engaging and I feel privileged to speak to you about this kind of personal problem in your lives and to be part of this conversation where you had a… an opportunity to put yourself in… in her experience and… and for you to be able to… to hear that and… and I’ll be interested to see where that takes you over the next period of weeks and uh… uh… what difference that might, will make to you and how you approach this issue. So, thanks for your… for your (inaudible ). 

00:34:18
ALFRED Thank you. Thanks for you help. 

00:34:20
LUCY Thank you, Thank you. 

00:34:25
Potential Pitfalls, Caveats, and Considerations 

00:34:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Umm… So like with anything, like with any intervention or any sort of ideas there are things you need to look out for. Umm… And so here are some things that are really important to hold in mind and… and really uh… not lose track of. The first thing is, as the therapist we’re not on a fact-finding mission. So we’re… we’re not actually interviewing him to get the real story or to nail something down, that’s not this is for. What this is for is to help bring forward her hopes and dreams and concerns and intentions in as richer way as possible, that’s what we’re… that’s what we’re looking for. So, what can get you into trouble are sort of her thinking; Oh, wait that’s not the truth, but we’ve already should have attended to that as the best of our ability. Umm… What can also get you into trouble is getting caught up in ah… in the problem. So, if… if I as a therapist get pulled into going so Jill, again I’m talking to Jack uh… what seems to be the problem and how did it get so bad and what… what’s the worst part about it and we don’t wanna ask questions like that because then we’re just thickening the problem story and it's not actually serving our purposes. So watch out for problems actually at we’re interviewing. The third thing to watch out for our… our questions that are too complex so uh… Jill when the two of you were on that party that time, what did it seem like Jack was thinking about you that he hadn’t been thing about before? Keep it as simple as possible, as clear as possible umm… you can get to sort of second and third order questions later down the road. Umm… And then this one actually is… is super important and pretty clear ah… you’ll… you’ll see it come in and it's pretty clear what to do in the face of it. So, if you start talking to Jack and he’s Jill and you say; So Jill say a little about what sort of your concern has been umm… or how is that it's come to be this way? Uh… And then he says to you; Well I’m just controlling, I’m controlling and I don’t like anything Jack does and I think he’s awful and I have father issues. And so that… that, right embedded blame in his response, we just wanna lookout for. And so, what we’d wanna do is as a therapist in that situation is just jump in and, hold on a second, you know what, you got to ask that question so well, I guess what I mean is so Jill what would you like to see happen? So, if you can’t get… if you can’t have a conversation about an articulation of a concern that… that stays sort of supportive, you just pop that into… what would you like to see happen? 

00:37:10
ROB SANTOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:37:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA How would you like that to go? What are you dreams of for this situation? So you just pop right out of that and into something else. And if you can’t do it, you’re… you’re going to ease out of that whole conversation pretty quickly, right? 

00:37:20
ROB SANTOS You know and there are… and there are variations and by gender frankly in… a… a… a with therapist in how to intervene in that too, because that’s, that’s a territory where I as a man have more credit under patriarchy to sort of be a little bit more challenging and say; Is that… Is that how Jill would describe her experience or you know to… to help him sort of… 

00:37:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA So you’d… So you’d pop out of the interview for a second to say that and then go back in. 

00:37:55
ROB SANTOS Exactly, exactly. 

00:37:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA I see, I got you. And, and… 

00:37:55
ROB SANTOS But just… and just in that moment. 

00:37:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA You bring out… You bring up a great point that I think is worth mentioning. The things that, because our work is so influenced by ideas of sort of gender specifications and what works for man and what doesn’t work for man and in our experience, it is different, if you are a female therapist or a male therapist. The ways in which you sort of approach this are gonna be different. You know while I talk about the fact that he can push on guys in a way that I can’t, because it gets right up differently because it gets experience differently and pushing on guys is probably too stronger way of talking about it, but being a little more challenging, being a little more really you know sort of ah… things pushing on. So that’s just will be mindful. 

00:38:35
ROB SANTOS I can be experienced just standing on the side of ideas around accountability more easily. 

00:38:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:38:40
ROB SANTOS And with less reactivity. 

00:38:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yes, and I get read up as I have an agenda… 

00:38:45
ROB SANTOS Yeah. 

00:38:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA …and I’m trying to sort of convince him to do something or something like that. 

00:38:45
ROB SANTOS Yeah, yeah. 

00:38:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Which is fine, it just means we have, we use different skills. 

00:38:50
ROB SANTOS Yeah and we both have the experience of doing this… this intervention really successfully and with really similar results and so you know your mileage may vary but you know your… your… it will be incumbent(ph) upon you as a therapist to that new answer… 

00:39:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:39:10
ROB SANTOS uh… with attention to your own specific… specific situation. 

00:39:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA So the only final thing I want to say is that this entire intervention is Internalized Other Interviewing can’t be used with people who are experiencing any kind of dissociation or psychosis or delusion. It’s… It’s just entirely too disruptive and is… is absolutely contraindicated. So it’s off the table for those situations. 

00:39:35
ROB SANTOS So there are… are of course some situations where uh… this interviewing process can be a little bit difficult for guys maybe without experiences that it’s not, we’re always surprised by how readily guys, even guys are showing up things; I don’t know what her problem is, right? How readily they enter into uh… an understanding of what it is she cares about. But sometimes it’s a real, it can be a struggle. And first ah… we look to make an easier entry for him into her experience by asking more concrete questions, like Jill what kind of car do you drive? Jill how did you get here today? Umm… And to… And to just open the seal a little bit on imagining her experience. Ah… There are rare occasions where uh… he for many reasons can just draw blank, can really struggle uh… to an extent where to continue would be… would be unfair to him. Umm… And those are usually cases where we move instead towards what we call noticing and remembering project. We would… We would find a… try and find a way to invite a guy into a noticing and remembering project. And what that means basically is you know we… we take the opportunity to have a guy say whether or not it’s okay for him. You know is it… is it the ideal relationship stake for him that he struggles so much to… to know and identify much about his partner’s experience? In every case, we find guys of good faith who want relationships weren’t… weren’t highly committed to only patriarchal value. We find guys, they know actually want I don’t feel good about being so disconnected from just the details of her experience. And most guys in situations like that will willingly volunteer for a noticing and remembering project and basically that means what can you do this week to keep an eye peeled for any situation where you might notice that she’s having an experience, she is having the feeling or she’s thinking something, right? Because the same guys have lots of experience of moments during the week when she’s mad at me, right? How is that you come to notice that? What is that you see, right? And what sense do you make of it? Like what do you think she’s thinking at the moment? So coming back the next week, we work on that noticing practice and that turns into developing a bit of library of understanding of what she cares about, what’s important to her. And then what… what does it look like to move forward during the week in a way that’s committed to remembering those values of hers, right. This practice alone tends to help a guy move fairly quickly to a position where he understands actually… actually get what it is she is unhappy about. 

00:42:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA So here is what we have found sort of outcomes when we do this intervention are… are really moving and really something that we’ve come to care about deeply because it just may seem to make a difference. What we notice as women feel less alone, there’s less agitation and escalation that happens between the couple. Men become really connected to feelings of competence, capability and usefulness in relationship that by doing this all of those things become really available to guys. And that the relationships themselves are experienced and described as feeling like being a team that by and large, I… I just have never had an experience of doing this and not have those (inaudible ) outcomes, Karl Tomm is a genius and it really is this really transformative thing that we’ve found with the straight couples. 

00:43:45
ROB SANTOS Yeah, yeah, yeah! We’re… We’re just to… to finish by mentioning Karl Tomm exceptionally grateful to the thinking and work that he put in to this practice. It’s… We feel like it’s incredibly powerful, incredibly respectful umm… and just raises all kinds of wonderful possibilities from moving forward for the kind of relationships that people are trying to have today. 

00:44:15
Next Dr. Barrera meets with Alfred alone. Here she demonstrates the useof the internalized Other Intervention in an individual session. 

00:44:20
ALFRED Yeah on Thursday my wife, my wife and I went to our son's IEP meeting and, and the school wants to cut off all his services so… 

00:44:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Oh wow! 

00:44:30
ALFRED So it’s been really stressful for us. 

00:44:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm…Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:35
ALFRED Yeah we feel, we feel very impacted by that. We were, we were impacted by that yeah. 

00:44:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Oh I think! 

00:44:45
ALFRED Yeah you know to our son, you know he is really care about himself. 

00:44:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:44:50
ALFRED We want to make sure his, make sure his development because he has a, a mild autism. 

00:44:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:55
ALFRED So we want to make sure that his involvement comes along and we have hopes that he’ll you know he’ll graduate from high school and go to university and, and so, so it’s quite(ph) lot of stress to us right now. 

00:45:05
DR. LYRA BARRERA I would imagine yeah and particularly hearing that there may be cutting off your services. 

00:45:10
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:45:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA How that you’ve been talking about it like after the, after the IEP would like, how did that go? 

00:45:20
ALFRED It was, it was quite a shock, so I think we are in a process of, of sort of taking in what had happened, taking in the information and processing the information. And then now we’ve sort of move in, moved into a stage where we’re, we’re sort of now proactive. So now we are looking to meet with, with advocates and legal representatives. And, and I’ve been doing the research so I’ve been staying up quite a bit now at night. And so that’s made me a little bit on edge during the day because… 

00:46:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Because you’re tired… 

00:46:00
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:46:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:46:05
ALFRED Little bit tired. 

00:46:05
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:05
ALFRED Yeah so… 

00:46:05
DR. LYRA BARRERA And then when the two of you start talking about it, you and Lucy, how’s that been going? Is it been going okay or has it been stressful between you or does it feel like you’ve found a good way of talking about it or how’s that going? 

00:46:20
ALFRED Well, we really see each other as, as teammates in this you know. So it’s nice to have her support. 

00:46:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:46:25
ALFRED But like I said I just had a lower threshold for… 

00:46:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:46:30
ALFRED …for frustration. 

00:46:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:46:30
ALFRED So little things can get, can get sort of overblown sometimes. 

00:46:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Umm… 

00:46:40
ALFRED And, and it’s a specific… Well, sometimes I tend to, to, to approach situations in my own mind and sort of just try to figure things out. 

00:46:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA Umm… 

00:46:55
ALFRED And Lucy will, will sort of try to, try to draw me out a little bit and find out what’s going on. 

00:47:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:00
ALFRED And I know she’s been getting a little bit frustrated about the fact that I’ve, that I use humor sometimes to, to sort of um… not, to sort of not share exactly what’s going on. 

00:47:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah… 

00:47:15
ALFRED Sort of that, I don't know if it’s sort of distraction or something like that. 

00:47:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:20
ALFRED And she responded out I make I’ve been making on the jokes. 

00:47:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:25
ALFRED And so she’s getting a little bit upset about it. 

00:47:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Is it about the jokes? 

00:47:30
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:47:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:30
ALFRED About the jokes, you know. 

00:47:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA So, from more you’re setting it feels like you got all of the stress. You’re really tired. You’ve been doing all this research and trying to figure stuff out on your own. And that despite your best efforts it feels like then Lucy is trying to have a conversation about it. And she’s feeling like, I’m trying to argue out, I'm trying to figure out what’s going on. 

00:47:45
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:47:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA And then for some reason it feels like for you humor comes up which then has this effect that it doesn’t feel great to her or something like that is that, is that how’s it’s going? 

00:47:55
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:47:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA Kind of like that? 

00:47:55
ALFRED Yeah, yeah. 

00:48:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA And how is that for you? Do you wish like she would just sort of like you be, do you feel like, like she knows how you are? I mean how, how is it for you that she keeps trying draw you out and stuff like that? 

00:48:15
ALFRED Um… I mean I, I know it really different. She is really the type of person that will, that will usually always share what she’s thinking about. And then we’ll try to get input from everyone and, and that’s just the way she is. And, and I’m little bit different in a way that sometimes I use to think about my, you know a situation of my own and try to make my own solutions and things like that. 

00:48:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:35
ALFRED So it does, it does feel a bit stressful sometimes when she, when she, she I guess she tries sort of to figure out what’s going on in my mind. 

00:48:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:50
ALFRED And then… 

00:48:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:50
ALFRED And then I guess her complaint is that, I’m making jokes to sort of you know not share you know what I’m really thinking about. 

00:49:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah! Uh…Huh… 

00:49:00
ALFRED Or what’s really going on. And sometimes I don’t really realize that I’m doing it. I think it’s something that I’ve probably done maybe all my life. 

00:49:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:49:10
ALFRED So it’s like a habit or I just sort of… 

00:49:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:49:15
ALFRED …react that way. 

00:49:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… And that what’s ends up happening it sounds like it’s in her frustration for everybody like there is frustration that she is trying to have a conversation and you sort of this habit of humors coming up and for you, you are trying to figure stuff out. But she is trying to draw you out. So there is like a little bit of a, and like you’re saying you’re different about that stuff. Like you have a different way of doing things right. 

00:49:35
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:49:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA So, given that like you know, you guys are under a lot of stress and a lot of pressure and you’re trying to figure this thing out in terms of the IEP and what to do next. And I guess part of what I’m wondering is if you be willing to just for a minute sort of talk to me as her for a second so I could sort of get her view on this humor thing and, on sort of trying to draw you out and all that, would that be okay if I interviewed you as her for a second? 

00:50:00
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:50:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah, so do you know what I mean? (Inaudible ) call you Lucy and I’m gonna ask you sort of how things are going, but do it, so that you would answer me as her for just about this thing. Will that be okay? 

00:50:10
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:50:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Okay if you feel wired and doesn’t work just tall time out and we'll do sometimes but let we test(ph) and see. 

00:50:15
ALFRED Sure. 

00:50:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Okay, okay, okay. So I’ll just sort of ease into it so that it's easy to sort of be her for a second. So uh… So Lucy what are you wearing today? 

00:50:30
ALFRED I’m wearing a shirt and pants… 

00:50:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Uh…Huh… 

00:50:35
ALFRED …and shoes. 

00:50:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA A shirt, pants and shoes. 

00:50:35
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:50:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Alright, and it’s a timeout for a second just to say if you don’t know the answer or anything to say, but don’t just say I don’t in past but sort of just trying to fill in, she is not here. She can’t hear. She is not going to yell up you anything. Right so maybe just what guess what might say. So you if you get sort of stuck about like I gonna to ask you have a breakfast, but then I thought maybe but no I don't know she had breakfast. 

00:51:00
ALFRED Uh…Huh… Okay. 

00:51:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA …but you sort of fill it in with your best imagination. Or it's part of what we are trying to do it is fill out a little bit what it might be like for her. So it seems okay? 

00:51:05
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:51:05
DR. LYRA BARRERA Okay so we’ll go back into that thing now. It's okay. 

00:51:10
ALFRED Alright. 

00:51:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Okay so Lucy we are wearing these pants and the shirt and shoes and we’re talking right. 

00:51:15
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:51:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA What do have breakfast this morning? 

00:51:20
ALFRED I had pancakes with bacon and eggs. 

00:51:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:51:25
ALFRED A glass of milk and glass of orange juice and cereal. 

00:51:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Delicious. 

00:51:30
ALFRED In the breakfast barn. 

00:51:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Okay awesome, fantastic. 

00:51:35
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:51:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Ah… So Lucy I’m sort of wondering I want to ask you just a little bit about you know I know there has been a lot going on with the IEP and you and Alfred are to trying to sort figure out what did you next and Lucy, can you just tell me for a second, can… can you walk me through like… like after you guys left the IEP, can you just sort of tell me what happened after that Lucy from your perspective? 

00:52:00
ALFRED Yeah. Umm… We went in may be like around 2:30, got out probably like around 5:00. 

00:52:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Well. 

00:52:15
ALFRED So it was a little bit darker, then it seemed like the… like the weather was so reflecting our mood, it was now a little bit darker, cloudier… I was… I was… It was… It was a big surprise, their proposition, what they proposed for my son, so I was pretty shocked. Umm… 

00:52:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA What did you say to Alfred about it? 

00:52:40
ALFRED To Alfred I said that I don’t agree with what they proposed and I said that, and I told them that the analysis and all their assessment were… were not our son. 

00:52:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA Umm…Umm… 

00:52:55
ALFRED You know I told them that we needed to do something that we’re gonna have to… that we’re gonna have to reject their IEP and… and sort of argue or try to get them to… to include us in his… in the decision about his… about his… his program. 

00:53:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… And so, as you were talking to Alfred about this as you were saying, you know I don’t agree with their proposition and we really have to figure this out, how were you feeling? Did you know how you were feeling at the time? 

00:53:30
ALFRED I was feeling angry. I was feeling upset. And I was also feeling betrayed, because I trusted that the school had our interests… 

00:53:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:53:45
ALFRED …you know in mind. 

00:53:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:53:50
ALFRED And also some of things that were done were… were also misleading, like his teacher uh… bumped our, his triennial IEP, bumped it forward claiming that it would be better for us, because if he had it next year soon it would… if it… she didn’t bump it… it would end up being very soon next year. 

00:54:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:54:20
ALFRED And that teachers wouldn’t really know him, wouldn’t know how to set… wouldn’t really have a picture of who he is and wouldn’t be able to really make an appropriate decision about his education. So that was pretty manipulative, that way she bumped up forward… 

00:54:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:54:35
ALFRED …to tell us that he didn’t… he wasn’t going to having more services. 

00:54:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… So that left you in the feeling of betrayal about the whole system and feeling like they had your best interest in mind but then, initially and then feeling like where… what… how do you… it doesn’t feel like ever best interested mind. 

00:54:50
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:54:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA And… And as you were talking to Alfred about it did it, did it feel like he was sort of with you on that? Did it feel like as you were trying to talk about it, was he… you know was he doing that thing that he does sometimes where he sort of uses humor like to you know put up a wall or something like or how… how did… how did that part go? 

00:55:10
ALFRED He was with… He was with me at that moment. 

00:55:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA He was? 

00:55:15
ALFRED Yeah, yeah! I think he felt probably the same way I did. 

00:55:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:55:20
ALFRED Yeah, we were both pretty much in agreement. 

00:55:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA You are about, about the assessment and what to do next and stuff like that? 

00:55:25
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:55:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

00:55:30
ALFRED Yeah, the stuff with the humor and his jokes… 

00:55:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:55:30
ALFRED …that started happening a little bit, a few days after or the next day… 

00:55:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Oh it did? 

00:55:35
ALFRED …as we were sort of getting our situation to gather and you know starting to encounter a little bit more stress and… 

00:55:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:55:45
ALFRED …and just more things to do. 

00:55:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA So can you tell me… Can you just Lucy tell me a story about when… when that happened just break it down for me it will, like old play by play like when he… from your perspective sort of when that happened? 

00:55:55
ALFRED Yeah! Umm… Yesterday we were driving in the car and… and we were just having a conversation. I think we were talking about the fact that we needed to… to get him assessed by a different group of individuals, different speech psychologists or speech pathologists to get a different, you know a different uh… version of… of, of what Lewis, you know his capabilities. 

00:56:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:56:25
ALFRED And umm… 

00:56:30
[sil.] 

00:56:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA So… So you, Lucy were in the car with Alfred… 

00:56:35
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:56:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA …and… and his sense of humor to whose humors when it came up at some point? 

00:56:40
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:56:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Do you remember what… what was… what you were doing when that happened? What were you… that you are talking about needing to get some new person to do another assessment? 

00:56:50
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:56:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA Right? 

00:56:50
ALFRED Yeah, right. 

00:56:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA And do you remember what like when did you got hit with the humor? 

00:56:55
ALFRED What really happ… Yeah. What it was like umm… was that we were talking about that and we’ve been talking about that a lot recently. 

00:57:05
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:05
ALFRED And then I feel like we haven’t been… we haven’t been paying any attention to each other. 

00:57:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Oh! Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:10
ALFRED That… That I try to make you know hold his hand or that I’ll try to say something sweet to him and he’ll respond with you know with a joke… 

00:57:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA Oh, I see! 

00:57:20
ALFRED …like you know it make some sort of a funny voice to talk about the son or something else and other topic. 

00:57:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Uh… So you’re trying to make these efforts to connect to him during this really stressful time. And when you go to reach Alfred’s hand or to do something like that he sort of makes a joke about something else in a funny voice or something like that? 

00:57:40
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:57:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Uh…Huh… 

00:57:40
ALFRED Yeah, yeah. 

00:57:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA What does that you feel like in the moment, Lucy? 

00:57:50
ALFRED So, I feel… I feel disconnected you know. 

00:57:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA You’re disconnected? 

00:57:55
ALFRED Disconnected with him. 

00:57:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA Uh…Huh… 

00:57:55
ALFRED You know because… 

00:58:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:58:00
ALFRED …it’s important for… for us to stay connected emotionally and to you know because we’re… we’re both facing this you know this challenge. 

00:58:05
DR. LYRA BARRERA Uh…Huh… 

00:58:10
ALFRED And we have to work together. 

00:58:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA So you really have the sense that particularly during this time connection is really important. And so you’re sort of making efforts toward that, toward staying connected, toward not being disconnected, and in moments like that when you read out to him and he responds with humor, it feels like disconnection because you’re thinking, especially now we have to be feeling close. 

00:58:30
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:58:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Is that right? 

00:58:35
ALFRED Right. 

00:58:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Uh…Huh… 

00:58:35
ALFRED Yeah. 

00:58:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Okay, yeah. So what is it that start to get you thinking about like; oh my god I’m reaching out to him and he’s responding in this disconnected way? Like what is that… where does that start to take you? 

00:58:50
ALFRED Umm… It starts to make me feel, I guess a little bit neglected the situation, it’s a big situation in our lives and it’s taking up a lot of our thoughts and time. But for me it’s important to stay connected. 

00:59:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA It’s important. 

00:59:10
ALFRED Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah because what happens when the two of you connected from your point of view like what difference does it make for you Lucy when you’re connected to Alfred? 

00:59:25
ALFRED Umm… When we’re connected, I feel safe. 

00:59:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Really? 

00:59:30
ALFRED Yeah! I feel like I have a high support and that we can get through any challenges. 

00:59:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Wow! So safe in his support and you can get through any challenge. Big deal, small deal? It seems like a big deal? 

00:59:45
ALFRED Yeah it’s probably a big deal. 

00:59:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… So this connection was really important to you for those… for those reasons for feelings of safety and support and like we’re looking ahead of these challenges and we can do it together. And it’s I mean I’m sort of hearing I think that in those tiny moments when you’re reaching out to try and have this connection that’s what you’re trying to stay connected to you, that’s an action toward that and that when he sort of responds with humor for whatever reason we can find out that later that it, it interrupts that that’s what it disrupts that. 

01:00:20
ALFRED Hmm…Hmm… 

01:00:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA …disconnection. 

01:00:20
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:00:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Okay, okay, makes sense. So can we get out of rule as Lucy for a second and check in with you Alfred? 

01:00:30
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:00:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA About what that was like? 

01:00:35
ALFRED It was really interesting. 

01:00:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Really? 

01:00:35
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:00:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Well, what part? 

01:00:40
ALFRED I mean that I guess the whole situation itself I don’t usually get into my wife’s perspective for you know more than a second maybe one second or something. 

01:00:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

01:00:50
ALFRED So I sort of was forced to look at you know situations from a different perspective and something I wouldn’t normally do. 

01:01:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Sure. 

01:01:00
ALFRED So, it’s insightful. 

01:01:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… And, and being inside her experience about this in particular, what is there something that sort of surprised you in there? 

01:01:10
ALFRED Yeah! I was surprised to get to the bottom of, of her feeling of, of safety. 

01:01:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA Of safety? 

01:01:15
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:01:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… But you are sort of surprised to find out that there was sort of the big deal in there. 

01:01:25
ALFRED Yeah, yeah because we’ve talked about the fact that you know our relationship, our family is sort of the most important thing and then from there we can you know deal with everything else if that’s doing, if that’s doing good. 

01:01:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

01:01:40
ALFRED If that’s you know. 

01:01:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

01:01:45
ALFRED Good. But I guess I hadn’t really thought about what it is that makes that family unit. 

01:01:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA I got you! And so being in her experience and going; Oh my god where is that going? She is having these experiences where she reaches out to me in an attempt to be connected and she is having this humor wall or whatever hit her, wait, that’s, that’s actually compromising this thing that we’ve actually said is really important to our family. Like we’ve said as a family we can do anything as long as we stay connected and we’re together in it. And so by doing this just now you’re sort of going; Alright, those are those moments, those are the things that make up the thing that we say is important. Is that sort of what you’re getting a little bit. 

01:02:25
ALFRED Yeah! Hmm…Hmm… 

01:02:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

01:02:25
ALFRED I guess you could say it’s like the fuel for like a car or something. 

01:02:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA Ah… The fuel! 

01:02:30
ALFRED It’s that important to have fueling your car if you want to… 

01:02:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA Sure. 

01:02:35
ALFRED …go anywhere. 

01:02:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA So as we’ve talked, as we were talking about it now what else do you think goes into the fuel? Like so some other (inaudible ) some of it, like what else is in there in terms of what makes that happen and go? 

01:02:50
ALFRED Um… Probably sharing how you feel about her, like you know like, like may be to sharing that you know she looks pretty or she is special. 

01:03:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

01:03:00
ALFRED Just letting her know how I feel. I mean I tend to think that, I tend to think that if I’ve told her once that she, she knows and she remembers… 

01:03:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA That’s it, take it off the bottom, it’s done, that’s all, just do it once, that’s it, she knows forever. 

01:03:15
ALFRED Yeah! Right, right. 

01:03:20
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah it’s a, it’s a really good point. I think people do it all the time, right? They go, I told her once she is going to remember that she knows that. 

01:03:25
ALFRED Right. 

01:03:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA But as you’re talking now what are you starting to think about that idea? 

01:03:30
ALFRED You know really I’m starting to think that you, you don’t just put fuel in your car once or you don’t just make, you know give, (inaudible ) oil change and then, and then expect it to run. 

01:03:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

01:03:40
ALFRED You know, for the rest of its life perfectly. So it’s sort of like discontinuous maintenance that you have. 

01:03:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA Got you! And so what does the humor do? What’s the relationship between the fuel and the humor do you think? 

01:03:55
ALFRED I think that the relationship is that, that the fuel I’m putting into the car is either not the right kind of fuel or, or not, it’s not going to make the car run you know it’s not the right thing to put into the relationship. 

01:04:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Well, so, I might just want ask more questions about that right, because it sounds like and this could be whole other conversation for another session right but that, that there is something that’s got you thinking, I got to take care of this. I’m going to figure out it out myself once I get to bottom of this problem then right you are sort of going, you usually think about things on your own, right? 

01:04:30
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:04:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA And we are sort of starting to question, wait a minute, if that feels like what you are supposed to do and then she comes and try and elicit stuff from you and you put up a humor wall that you right now was starting to go; Wait a minute, does that actually serve this idea of the fuel of the car? Does this actually serve what we’re saying is important to our family? I mean is that sort of, kind of you thinking like I don’t know this sort of deflecting and putting up a wall might not be doing the thing I was… 

01:04:55
ALFRED Right. 

01:04:55
DR. LYRA BARRERA …I overall really care about? 

01:05:00
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:05:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Is that kind of it? 

01:05:00
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:05:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA Well… 

01:05:00
ALFRED I think yeah, I think you described the right. I’m not doing you know what’s appropriate for that, for the relationship. 

01:05:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Alright! (Inaudible ) appropriate right we can go just to a way as you sat to be her for a second, you started… you got much closer to the, to the, the practices in your relationship that make the car of your relationship go, right? 

01:05:25
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:05:25
DR. LYRA BARRERA And you’re going; Oh, that’s what she was trying to do. We were driving together, she reached over, I cracked a joke, I don’t think of it. But if I reflect on her for more than just a second it’s right there. You just knew right there you were like; Oh I know what it is for her, it’s safety, it’s feeling supportive like it was right there, right? 

01:05:45
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:05:45
DR. LYRA BARRERA And so now I used to go; Oh, may be I’ll let this go by in the same way or I don’t know I don’t know if it takes you there. 

01:05:50
ALFRED Yeah I think you’re right. I think, yeah, I think that I’ll, you know I’ve a different perspective on you know what those little things that are happening throughout the day those that show her some affection or those intents to receive affection or to connect. 

01:06:05
DR. LYRA BARRERA Hmm…Hmm… 

01:06:10
ALFRED And I realize that they’re probably important to make that overall relationship you know. 

01:06:10
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah. 

01:06:15
ALFRED To stay in good health. 

01:06:15
DR. LYRA BARRERA And, and it something that’s important to you I mean you’re a guy who had just said, we made a commitment as a family to know that we have each others backs, right? Like you didn’t say it that way, but that if we sort of stick together we can do whatever needs to get done. We can rise to any challenge, right? 

01:06:30
ALFRED Yeah, yeah. 

01:06:30
DR. LYRA BARRERA But that’s something that’s important to you… 

01:06:35
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:06:35
DR. LYRA BARRERA …not just to her. 

01:06:35
ALFRED Yeah I agree it is important to both of us, very important. 

01:06:40
DR. LYRA BARRERA Yeah, yeah! I will be excited to hear the next time we talk how sort of noticing those moments and noticing the moments when she is reaching out to you. I’ll be interested to hear how you respond differently. 

01:06:50
ALFRED Yeah. 

01:06:50
DR. LYRA BARRERA I’ll be you know. 

01:06:50
ALFRED Yeah I’ll definitely keep that in mind you know definitely look for those moments and, and remember all these conversations. 

01:07:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA And just see what happens. 

01:07:00
ALFRED Okay. 

01:07:00
DR. LYRA BARRERA And then let me know. 

01:07:00
ALFRED Alright. 

01:07:05
