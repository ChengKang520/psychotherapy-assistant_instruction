Jon 

00:00:20
JON I mean, I… I use the term social phobia, it’s a nice tag. I mean, it’s just a… just what is like to be me is… is that here I am, you know, I’m on planet Earth, I look around, I see other human beings and they are doing things that I want to do. Umm… You know, they’re having relationships, they are happy, they’re in families and… and I am trapped here in this body and I can’t be do any of those things. Umm… I mean, now that I am further on in recovery, I am doing some of those things, but for… for 30-40 years in my life, I felt that a cruel joke had been played on me and… and that I was trapped in this body which looks perfectly fine to everybody, but a natural fact that I was extremely disabled. 

00:01:10

Eric 

00:01:15
ERIC If you can imagine being in a constant state of fear, a constant state of panic with rapid breathing, incredible muscle tension, feelings of disassociation which means to me a feeling of umm… not really being connected or in touch with uh… your true feelings, the whole thing is just difficult to explain, but it’s very demanding in terms of umm… energy. 

00:01:50
Lisa 

00:01:50
LISA It’s very, very hard for people to understand what you’re going through until they’re actually in your situation because it’s really terrifying. You go shopping and you… just shopping is so simple to people who don’t have social phobia. But actually somebody that does, it’s a biggest, biggest task. (inaudible) and I used to go and do it and come home and I’d be exhausted. A headache and cigarette after cigarette, cups of coffee and just horrible. 

00:02:20
Dr Lisa Lampe 

00:02:20
Consultant Psychiatrist 

00:02:20
DR. LISA LAMPE Well, social phobia is an anxiety of social interaction, a fear of social interaction which can be a fear that you are going to do or say something embarrassing, a fear that you are going to look anxious, but the underlying fear is really that somebody is going to think something bad of you, all right? Or what we call it the fear of negative evaluation that people are going to think that you’re not happy to scratch, that you’re a bit strange that, maybe they don’t like you, that somehow uh… people are going to disapprove of you or not like you. 

00:02:55
ERIC You’re really thinking about bringing the center of attention, but not in a positive way. You feel that you’re a center of attention umm… because of some slight or inadequance… inadequacy or incompetence and that’s what makes being a center of attention umm… painful. 

00:03:15
LISA So it was the sweaty palms that… the hot… The hot flashes, I think the ones that worried me the most because people would actually say that I was really freaking at all time. 

00:03:25
DR. LISA LAMPE Well, I think a useful way to think about social anxiety is to view it is being on a spectrum. And at one in the spectrum is normal social anxiety, the desire that we all have to be liked and respected, and approved of by people, then we have shyness which is perhaps a degree out from that where people are socially more anxious in more situations, reticent in novel social situations in particular, they look bit hesitant to take the initiative in social situations, that’s probably shyness. Then if we increase the level of social anxiety, we get to social phobia. So social phobia is where the anxiety has become so severe that it actually causes discomfort or causes the person to avoid certain social situations and it’s phobic, it’s out of proportion to what most people would experience in similar situations. 

00:04:20
LISA It is very scary because it’s not actually like, "Oh, there is a spider. Oh, my God, I’m scared of it." It’s just something in your mind that’s telling you, this is scaring you and the more you let it overwhelm you the more scared you get. 

00:04:35
JON So by the time umm… I was say, 12 or 13, I was actually very, very phobic and umm… I had a great inability to functioning the world at all. And umm… my first experience of actually having the panic attack was when I… I went to a… I think it was Saturday evening, I went to a church social umm… to try and get in and just walked up to the door and then turned and ran for it and umm… I’m not so sure that I tried too many other things after that. 

00:05:10
Dr Ron Rapee 

00:05:10
Associate Professor of Psychology Macquarie University 

00:05:10
DR. RON RAPEE In social situations people with social phobia, the main behavior is avoidance. So most commonly that a study can go into social situations umm… because they’ll try at all cost to get out of this. 

00:05:20
JON It’s the most terror you can have in your body umm… it’s… it’s… it’s… it’s… it’s like a nightmare, you can’t wake up from it. It’s just a totally unexplainable terror and much more terrifying than real terror of sustaining on a cliff edge or walking out in the street nearly being run over. It’s just a… It’s just really, really strange overpowering terror and… and you just run, you have to run from it, you know, and though you have to stop it and the way you stop it is to run away from the situation. 

00:05:50
DR. LISA LAMPE If people do managed to go uh… to the social situation to… to get involved in it, then they may use what we call subtle avoidance, so they may hide in a corner or they may be careful about who exactly they talked to or what exactly they say. Sometimes rehearsing ahead of times the things that they can say, which actually can be a useful technique when you’re learning to overcome your problems and when you’re in the middle of a graded exposure program that maybe one very appropriate step, but it can also be a form of avoidance. 

00:06:25
LISA I mean, I used to have my little boy shopping with me, so he could help me unload the grocery shoppings ’cause he’d be center of attention and everybody that was standing behind me say, wouldn’t be watching me and then I’d say (inaudible), give the lady the money ‘cause I couldn’t like eye contact with her and so then everybody thought, "Oh, isn’t that cute little boy giving the lady money?" Then I wouldn’t have worry about it. I could just stand there and get out of there and I used to walk out there with him, horrific headaches. 

00:06:50
[music] 

00:06:55
JON The problem was in form, my teens, my 20s, my 30s and my early 40s, I… I mean, I didn’t have what I may… I didn’t have the skills umm… so it was in a way futile that I was going to do for my level of social phobia. I mean, I was just continuingly banging my head against to (inaudible) and trying to just recover by going out and doing things. Umm… I mean, I made no progress at all. 

00:07:20
DR. LISA LAMPE Treatment can be very successful, there’s both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and I think what is important always to consider is the individual. So we can give rights from research trials to say, yes, well, cognitive behavior therapy can give this degree of outcome and medication can give this degree of outcome. Umm… But it’s a bit hard to predict who is going to respond to what, but certainly effective treatments are available. 

00:07:55
DR. RON RAPEE Probably the most popular treatments would be… what we broadly call cognitive behavioral treatments. These are treatments which uh… really the best way to think of them is very practical or common sense treatments. They focus on helping people to think more realistically in situations, they focus on helping people to concentrate better on what they’re doing rather on negative sorts of things and the most important component is… is that cognitive behavioral treatments focus on getting people to… to face the situations they fear to get back into the situations they’re concerned about. And by doing that to teach them that people are probably not evaluating me negatively, people probably don’t think I’m stupid or crazy or whatever and even if they do, so what? 

00:08:35
LISA I was happy because I knew I had something. I was happy that I had social phobia and that they could identify and I knew that they could might be better, but not they could might be better that I could my… myself better through them telling me what to do. I mean, I was glad. I kind of go, I am thinking, "Yes, I’ve got something, I’m not going insane." 

00:09:00
RONALD M. RAPEE For… For people with social phobia to get help theoretically and technically if… if you wanna talk that way, they can help themselves and umm… the book that that we’ve just recently put out umm… does provide a very detailed step-by-step program for people with social phobia to go through by themselves if they want. We would though always recommend that if possible that people try and see a therapist. It’s very hard to treat yourself. It’s often a very difficult to have a complete understanding of your own problem. It’s very difficult to have the motivation that you might need to… to go through a very difficult program. And it’s always good to have someone there to sort of help, guide you with the fine details and to help umm… indicate how best to apply the… the technique… techniques in the program to your own situation. 

00:09:45
Self Monitoring 

00:09:50
RONALD M. RAPEE The first step into any treatment program really would be to learn to get a better idea of your own anxiety, to get some more insight is possibly better way of… of putting it. So you can understand or see better, umm… way you get anxious, what sort of situations you get anxious in, how anxious you get, what sorts of factors might change that umm… higher or lower. So getting this sort of better understanding can usually come through keeping records and… and monitoring your anxiety for a period of time, a week, two weeks something like that. 

00:10:25
JON Monitoring your process by writing is excellent. And I have done… I… I did it mainly by journaling that was my way of doing it and I… I probably didn’t naturally use any form. So what I did was journal and in that journal, I did processes of writing my conversations down. And I think at first a long while ago, no, but I would probably at times have run through some of those conversations with my therapist. So, you know, any… any self-monitoring process (inaudible) down is helps you with this (inaudible), so you can show them to other people which is very helpful. 

00:11:00
RONALD M. RAPEE You don’t, yes, you don’t need to necessarily use very formalized forms umm… in the book, we… we include some set forms is because it’s often easier for people umm… to… to have set columns and things like that where they can do their recording. But if people find it difficult to that and if they’re prefer to umm… use an open-ended sort of diary format or… or even just of sort of try to keep uh… mental track of the way their behaving situations that’s probably okay, but it probably would be better to try to at least look out for certain types of things. And that’s why the forms are useful because they do point out the sorts of things you should be looking for. With the Social Situations Records, umm… the… the main idea is to umm… start to get a better feeling for the way you typically react in situations. Uh… You might, for example, be going shopping at your local supermarket. So in the first column where you write down the situation or the event, that’s exactly what you write down. You… You simply indicate shopping at local supermarket, for example. In the next column then you would indicate what you’re thinking while you’re doing that. What was it you worried about? So for example, you might have a thought like, I look really weird. In the next column, you indicate your level of anxiety or shyness or nervousness, and you can use the scale that that we put there from 0, not at all anxious, up to 8 being absolutely terrified. Let’s say for example, in this case, your shyness or your anxiety was 5. So it’s just a bit above moderate. In the next column, you… you write down or you indicate how you physically felt in that situation. So for example, you might’ve felt tense or you might’ve been shaking while you’re doing the shopping. In the final column, you write down the types of things that you actually did, the types of behaviors that you’re engaged in, in that situation. So for example, while you’re shopping you may have tried to hurry and you may not have looked at anyone. 

00:12:55
ERIC I supposed to a certain extent (inaudible) as separate from those feelings and take your step back and umm… take a look of what’s happening and how you’re feeling and realize that that anxiety or feeling umm… you can’t actually separate yourself from it and umm… attempt to control it umm… using umm… your thinking and challenging thoughts and… and using those processes. 

00:13:35
Cognitive Behaviour Therapy 

00:13:35
Realistic Thinking 

00:13:40
[music] 

00:13:45
JON Well, in a… in a situation, this… this is umm… sort of causing me panic. I mean… I mean a room with people. I mean, having a big reaction to it and I guess of having a feeling that… umm… that umm… someone was going to embarrass me, you know, and… and draw attention to me and may be, you know, well, look at Jon there, he can’t do this or he can’t, he doesn’t know that and that’s like, you know, that’s… that’s my experience of my schooling. So what I’m doing is I guess I’m… I’m… I’m thinking thoughts which probably, well, they’re just not appropriate for the situation I am in. 

00:14:30
DR. LISA LAMPE So much of our thinking is, in fact, automatic, habitual, and rather inflexible. Many of us have made our decisions about ourselves and the world way back and never really questioned it. 

00:14:45
JON A lot of times, it’s… it’s almost my parents speaking who were frightened of the world and had no trust of anybody and it’s their attitude that flow through my head all the time. 

00:14:55
ERIC I mean, obviously this time has been (inaudible) extreme anxiety and know situations of when you’re in an extremely dangerous situation, but there are also times where umm… the level of anxiety you experience is inappropriate for the situation and so as particular occasions that umm… cognitive behavioral therapy is useful. 

00:15:20
RONALD M. RAPEE And you repeat the whole process. 

00:15:25
DR. LISA LAMPE Now the whole rational behind cognitive behavior therapy is contained in a few principles. One of these principles is that it’s not really what happens to us that determines how we feel, but it’s what we think about what happens to us, or what we think about what is actually going on, what we think about ourselves, what we believe about how we interact with other people that is going to determine how we feel. 

00:15:55
RONALD M. RAPEE So if someone uh… nearby me starts to laugh I might think that person is laughing at me and I think I’m an idiot, then I might feel really embarrassed. I feel really embarrassed because of that thought that they… that they’re laughing at me, not because the person actually did the laughing. If that person was laughing and I thought that person is laughing at a funny joke they just heard, then I wouldn’t feel embarrassed. So it’s entirely my thoughts that determined how I feel, not what that person is actually doing. 

00:16:25
ERIC The thoughts just keep going umm… all on their own along their own track and CBT is just… just a way of umm… restructuring some of those thoughts umm… to enable you to umm… get a grip on anxiety and to also umm… provide a degree of umm… comfort. 

00:16:55
RONALD M. RAPEE If your feelings are very extreme, if you’re feeling very, umm… very nervous, particularly anxious or shy or terrified in situation, then you feel that your thoughts probably are unrealistic in that situation. 

00:17:10
ERIC But, you know, I suppose the major thrust of that is being able to challenge the way you think about various issues and to sort of tie that thinking up with evidence so that umm… you’re able to get a grip on your face and on your emotions umm… through your… your thinking process and, you know, I found the best way to do that is to umm… initially stop with the shade, such as, this one. 

00:17:50
RONALD M. RAPEE The form that uh… that we have in my book umm… goes through several columns. In the first column, uh… it asks about the event. So in that column, what you simply write down is the situation or the event that first triggered off or started off your anxiety. 

00:18:05
ERIC So the event for me, it is asking my particular manager a question. 

00:18:15
RONALD M. RAPEE In the second column, you need to write down your expectation or your prediction that is the thoughts or the beliefs that were in your head that caused you, directly caused you to feel anxious. And it’s very important there to write down all the possible thoughts that might go through your head. 

00:18:30
ERIC So I have quite a… quite a lot of umm… negative expectations in relation to this particular event and I write some of them down. One is humiliation for asking a stupid… stupid question. 

00:18:50
RONALD M. RAPEE In the third column, you then write down all of the evidence that is how do you know whether those thoughts are true or not true, realistic or unrealistic. 

00:19:00
ERIC So to challenge that umm… I look at previous experience and that is that most of my questions are well-thought out and have been well-received. Some additional events is the fact that I’ve done all the homework, I’ve worked through the problem and I’ve spoken to other people about it. And uh… the next point of course, the manager. A third challenge is just a fact that it’s reasonable to ask questions in any work environment umm… people ask any number of questions. So I… I would write down here. It’s realistic umm… the people who ask questions and it’s also realistic for questions to umm… to occasionally be silly or umm… obvious. 

00:19:50
[music] 

00:19:55
ERIC And the other evidence is umm… I know myself that I wouldn’t be right someone for asking me, I questioned him relation to work even if I did think it was slightly stupid and umm… this particular manager doesn’t have a history of umm… (inaudible) people or umm… addressing them down, umm… previous to this occasion so umm… that’s some more evidence I’ll write down. 

00:20:25
RONALD M. RAPEE You then workout some sort of probability for those thoughts is that very realistic based on that evidence is that… is that belief very likely to happen or not very likely to happen. 

00:20:35
ERIC Okay, looking at all the evidence I have in this third column, the initial expectation of umm… being humiliated for asking a stupid question umm… probably isn’t very probable. There is no a lot of evidence based on the past and what I know about this particular person umm… that he is gonna behave in the way that I fear. So I’ll put it down as 10%. I’ll write down here in the expectation column, umm… I may be perceived to be an incompetent by others. No need to do without a particular fear. And when I look at the evidence for umm… I come to realize that umm… if the manager did rant and rave and scream and dress me down after I had asked a perfectly reasonable question, well, then others would probably umm… view the manager in a negative light rather than myself because I know within my own self that the question was reasonable and I could also go and speak to individual members and explain the situation. 

00:22:00
RONALD M. RAPEE And finally, that should give you the (inaudible) degree of emotion, which hopefully if you’d looked at all of the evidence and if you’ve managed to make your thoughts more realistic that emotion should be lower than what it was at the beginning. 

00:22:15
ERIC And looking at that evidence, my degree of emotion is… has been reduced. At… at the beginning, I was feeling quite anxious, probably between a 7 and an 8, and now umm… I think my emotion would be at about a 5. It’s sort of like going back to kindergarten, you know, you feel all these emotion and anxiety and yet, the answer is meant to be in sitting down and filling… filling out what appears to be a silly sheet. Umm… I suppose the only thing that umm… you know, enables… enables me to keep doing it umm… and I have to do it as much anymore ‘cause lot of it is internalized, but the fact that it works. 

00:23:10
RONALD M. RAPEE Lots of forms will do much the same sort of thing and there’s no right or wrong form. The important thing is that people can at least learn to identify the situations and the unrealistic thoughts and that in some way they can learn to come up with more realistic types of thoughts. And as long as they’re doing those things, it doesn’t particularly matter which form they use. 

00:23:30
LISA These are the forms that we had to do at umm… the Anxiety Management Center (inaudible) on the course. It was actual irrational thoughts and the rational thoughts of how we had to set out in that way. I think being down on paper, it makes you realize that it’s working. The situation was these people come in to video me. So I’ll put down, being videoed. You’re nervous, but you think, also think to yourself what if I make an idiot of myself. So you put, what if I make an idiot of myself ’cause I always think about that. Idiot of myself. Then another one is what if I go red? So it’s one of my main things is, what is if I go red? What if I go red? And another one was, what if I can’t explain myself correctly? (inaudible) explain. Now rational coping thoughts if, so what if I make an idiot of myself ‘cause I can edit it. So I put that down, they can edit it, edit it. And what if I go red? So what if I go red ‘cause there’s some video on social phobia, so it doesn’t make any difference ‘cause everybody else probably do the same things I do. So I just put social phobia video, phobia video, and trying to explain myself, the people that have social phobia will understand what I’m trying to put across because they’re all suffering the same as me. So they will be able to understand me, hopefully. So I’ll just put down, people couldn’t understand me. Just got to put down the logical way of thinking to your unlogical way of thinking, that’s the way I look at it. 

00:25:25
RONALD M. RAPEE I think for the realistic thinking part of things it’s really important to use a form at least for a short while, for people who really don’t like using forms, I think this is one area where they really should try to get into the discipline of using a form even if it’s just for a couple of weeks. 

00:25:40
ERIC Many of the things that you do or you have to think about like CBT or restructuring your thinking or challenging thoughts become automatic the more you use them and as well as becoming automatic, the response time is reduced so that umm… you find yourself uh… very quickly challenging thoughts that you’ve umm… always regarded as umm… being absolute or concurrent. 

00:26:25
Graded Exposure 

00:26:30
[music] 

00:26:35
ERIC It’s very hard to get anywhere with it, without challenging yourself and without putting yourself directly in these situations that you hide umm… because there’s no opportunity to put into practice the various techniques you’ve learned or to umm… use those tools unless you’re in the situation. It’s only when you’re in the situation that you can experience it all and adapt things to work for yourself. 

00:27:10
DR. LISA LAMPE Well, the behavioral elements of cognitive behavior therapy involve going out and… and testing out your realistic thinking in real life situations, but it’s easiest if you do that in an organized and structured fashion that also allows you to progress at your own tolerance. So to progress at a right that you can tolerate in terms of how much anxiety you choose to confront. And psychologists call this technique Graded Exposure. So the exposure part means that you’re actually exposing yourself to the things that you fear and the graded part means that you do it in a step-by-step fashion. And what we get people to do is we actually get them to stop by tackling the least anxiety provoking situations and as their confidence grows they work their way up to being able to tackle the more anxiety provoking situations. 

00:28:10
JON What I do to prepare… prepare to do something, well, I mean, it’s actually the first… the first stage very much nowadays is to, is actually picking a task, that’s… that’s of major, major part of the process for me. Umm… It’s because I have in the past tackled things too difficult, so now it’s picking a task. 

00:28:30
RONALD M. RAPEE The first step is to try to work out and what the situations are that you’re going to try and expose yourself to. To do that very simply, all you need to do is sit down brainstorm. You can do it by yourself or you can get a friend or family member involved and try to think about all the different possible situations that you might be afraid of. You then need to try and put those into some sort of order what we might call a stepladder or a hierarchy that is to start out with the ones that are easiest that don’t make it too diff… too anxious and then to put those up step-by-step all the way up to the ones, for the one that’s the very hardest of all. 

00:29:05
JON Umm… The first time I go there just… just go, make an enquiry and come home and umm… and so I build… build up to what I’m doing in… in gradual steps. So if it… If it means going into a dance, a bush dance like tonight or other forms of… of dancing, I’ll… I will probably go the first. I will destroy there the first time, go in the door, make an enquiry and then… and then I know the lay of the land and… and a sort of establish what’s going on there and then the next time I… I’ll, you know, maybe going and try enjoying the dance, but give myself permission not to stay long and then try to sit, so the process to go out is very much about planning and so that I won’t set myself any task that’s gonna scare the hell out of me and umm… and make me unsuccessful in achieving my goal. 

00:30:10
DR. LISA LAMPE Now there is a few important rules about Graded Exposure that you need to follow if you really want to get most out the effort that you’re putting in and confronting these anxiety provoking situations. So firstly, whatever you do you have to do it frequently. If you just do something this month and then you wait a month and you do it again then your anxiety level will probably be just as high about it. So you really have to do it frequently uh… and repeatedly and at close intervals until you master the anxiety that’s associated with it. 

00:30:40
JON My goal tonight is to get in the door, join the dance and stay for about half an hour, approximately. I don’t actually wear the watch. Umm… And that’s what it’s about. And then, you know, I… I feel reasonably confident at this point in time that I can do that. Umm… And then I just have to keep on doing that. It’s not a case of doing it once or twice or three times. It’s a case of just continuously doing it for however long it takes for me to feel safe in that sort of environment and then maybe after three months or a year or five years, I don’t know how long, I’ll start to enjoy it. 

00:31:20
DR. LISA LAMPE The other important thing is that you must stay in the situation until you feel your anxiety level start to diminish. If you escape a situation as your anxiety is rising then it actually tends to reinforce your anxiety about that situation and next time you’ll be just as anxious if not more so. 

00:31:40
JON Even If I do have the panic attack umm… at any stage umm… my training recovery says I must stay there. Uh… You know like, if I don’t, if I allow myself to run while I’m having a panic attack that we will set my recovery back. I haven’t done that for a while or so, if I have a panic attack, I just have to take myself off and sit there till the panic attack goes and then, and it’s okay to leave, so… 

00:32:05
DR. LISA LAMPE The other thing is that you can’t bailout and avoid it deciding that you’re really too anxious about it after all. Umm… You’ve got to try and set your task levels to be at a level that you could cope with even on a bad day and then even if you’re feeling anxious, you do it anyway. So you do it in spite of feeling anxious. 

00:32:25
JON I’ve… I’ve done things like, umm… you know, deliberately get lost when I get… I am going somewhere and I don’t… don’t know where to find it while I feel like damn sure, I don’t find it and just drive around, lost in the suburbs where I quite capable of pulling a street directory, I have to find where I am. But I just, you know, it’s like, it was in the past find any excuse not to… not to do things and umm… 

00:32:55
DR. LISA LAMPE The other important rules are not to take substances that will artificially diminish your anxiety about a task and that includes tranquillizer medications, alcohol, and the other substance a lot of people take is Inderal, which is a beta blocker, Propranolol is its real name, that sometimes prescribed by doctors to help people manage their anxiety. So you shouldn’t take any of those medications. You should take your… If you’re on anti-depressant, take it as usual every day, but don’t take anything to get you through a particular situation. You need to actually confront the anxiety then it causes and master it. 

00:33:35
JON Well, I’m… I’m gonna walk up the street and probably… probably, I think I’ll walk around the block. I think I’ll just say, well, I’m gonna walk around the block. I’m just gonna walk past to sort of look at the venue, see what it just, see working and where the entrance is, what’s going on there and then, you know, just probably may be not even around the block. The wall passed just sort of get myself together, my act together and me just calming down and, and go in and, umm… and do a couple of dances might be hopefully, so couple of dances in half an hour or so and there, and then, and then come out and flutter and umm… see what happens. I mean, I don’t know, I don’t know what will happen. So let’s do it then we’ll see. 

00:34:25

JON Wow, it was harder than I expected. I… I walked around the front of the building and it’s… it’s about to be demolished and… and the main entrance is all blocked off with… with fences it’s here. And then I walked, you know, and I… I had irrational thoughts, I thought, "Oh, God, they’ll all see me walking around the outside and I could hear the music." Anyway, I came back, I found the entrance and umm… calmed myself down, went it and, I never thought my worst, my worst fears, you know, as I walked in the door and that is it was a, it was a very big hall and there’s hardly anyone there at all. There was only about 12 people there and umm… but anyway, no, well, and then uh… My… I actually knew the person leading the… I don’t know if he knew me. Umm… But I knew the person leading it and I had met him before and umm… they do this, but it’s a small group like that you can’t just slide in anonymously and hide in the corner and, of course, immediately as I’m finished paying the money (inaudible) say, "Okay, three new people here come and join the circle." And I go, "Well, I wish what I’m here for." So, you know, and got label, name labels and what’s your name and, you know, which is all sort of, you know. I did it fine in anyway. So, you know, I joined the circle and learned the dance and did the one dance and I… And I… And I gave myself permission not to do the steps properly and I did one dance and then at that point I were having a break umm… anyway. So I went and sat down for a few minutes and I thought, well, (inaudible) it might be better to stay and do another dance. But it’s… it’s like pretty dry then I thought, you know, I’m coming out now so… It’s… It leaves me sort of umm… 50% celebrating ‘cause it’s enough. It’s just like another step forward, but then another half of me says, you know, like it’s got ridiculous. It seems ridiculous the drive of, you know, an air across town, pay $10, going to bush dance, being there for four minutes and then come out again. But, you know, I mean, umm… so I think in the last six months that I’ve even been able to get in the door, so it’s another… It’s just another step forward. It’s, you know, it’s about recovering from social phobia and I just leave me feeling totally drained and… and not really feeling any great, anything really. It’s just, I think Christ, that’s hover or something (inaudible), you know, and just, you know, let’s go home. 

00:37:05
DR. LISA LAMPE Now the other really important thing is to acknowledge when you’ve achieved what you set out to achieve. Don’t change the goal post after… after the task. Don’t come home and say, "Yeah, well, I did that, but I really should be able to do so much more." It’s not helpful. Focus on the step that you’ve taken, not where you think you should be. So get rid of shorts and allow yourself to take some pride in achievements because that will help to motivate you to take those other steps. 

00:37:35
JON But anyway, I did it and I joined it and did one dance, you know, so that’s furious better than sitting at times for 10 years, you know, am not doing anything… Yeah. 

00:37:45
Groups 

00:37:55
JON We all are extraordinary umm… but social phobia took that away from me for so many years and anxiety disorder, where I had no sense of the sort of wonder of being a human being, and… and… and… and… and… just anything is possible and if you’re motivated to do something, you can… you know, it’s… it’s not easy, but you can… you can do things and become things, you know, if you… if you have a vision to… to get somewhere, it is possible to do it and… and… and… everyone has this courage inside them and umm… one of the places to sort of get in touch with all of that is in… is in groups. 

00:38:35
DR. LISA LAMPE In any disorder, obviously, it can be really helpful to be able to have the chance to make some other people who know much more closely what you’ve been through then you’ve probably been able to explain to anyone before that there are some particular reasons why group treatment and social phobia can be so valuable. And one of those reasons is that if you go into a group with other people then right away you’re doing some exposure treatment because there you are having to sit umm… and perhaps, interact with at least a few other people. 

00:39:05
JON You know, ‘cause you’re just working so hard and you know how to do it. You know… you know, after that sort of become from. 

00:39:10
DR. LISA LAMPE Yeah, it’s almost like a training, you know. You have to… 

00:39:10
JON Well, I wouldn’t have recovered without… without support groups. I mean, that they were the place that I… I overcame my fear of being in a room without the people and talking. 

00:39:20
LISA It’s very hard to explain to somebody that hasn’t had it before. So people that have got it, you can… When I went to the group therapy it was just really, really good because you sit and you think I’m not the only one that’s weird. Everybody else has got it, too. It’s really good. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN Is that when we get all the symptoms… 

00:39:35
DR. LISA LAMPE So to come along and see other normal people is often a great relief because many people have labeled themselves as weird, strange, to have this problem to start with. I mean, that’s a lot of… where a lot of the depression comes from, in fact. And people with social phobia tend to be terribly self-critical. 

00:39:55
LISA When I went to the group I was very nervous and kind of when people walk in and like… they’re like… you’re all kind of very iffy ‘cause you… And then you sit down and you think, and you look at them, you know, when people at you, you think you’ve got the same problems, you’ve got social phobia, this is great because just talking amongst the group you realize everybody suffers, I mean, some of them are worse than me. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN Now that’s good. Yes. 

00:40:15
LISA Everybody suffers the same things as you do. It’s a really good feeling. It sounds really silly things to say, but it’s a really good feeling to know, you’re not the only one with social phobia. 

00:40:25
JON The courage of people, the courage of people who’ve never been into a room with people, who do it for the first time and people come to groups who’ve never been to groups before and sometimes people will come to groups where their spouse has an anxiety disorder and there, you know, and then… and then people are doing it and you see people recover and it just takes enormous courage. 

00:40:50
Managing General Anxiety 

00:40:50
Meditation 

00:41:00
JON The reason that I’m able to totally detach from myself and so there might be a witness is meditation, and not as much actually doing meditation as learning what meditation is and meditation is shutting your thoughts down. So there is place in you where you’re just observing your mind and it’s totally silent and peaceful and empty and a thought comes up and what you try and learn through meditation is you just say watch the thought and let the paper airplane, it might say, "Hey, you’ve forgotten umm… to put eggs on the shopping list." And you go, "Oh, yes." An irrelevant thought and you just let it fly past and you learn a technique of… of… of you’re not, you’re not your thoughts. Umm… You’re sort of, you’re, you’ve got like a spiritual essence umm… above that and it’s just like tapes running through a umm… a tape recorder and they’re going all the time and it’s… it’s probably though that learning that meditation technique. I have to say I’m not very good at doing it, but I do understand it, and then the understanding, I do tend to, I just remind myself that umm… I’m… I’m essentially not what I’m thinking. 

00:42:15
Medication 

00:42:20
DR. LISA LAMPE Now medication has also been shown to be effective in research trials where it’s been compared against the placebo and the medications that have been studied include tranquillizer medications and anti-depressant medications. However, because of the problems that are associated with tranquillizer medications like the benzodiazepines, I’m talking about principally umm… that would not be anybody’s suggested first line of treatment now because they have the problems with dependence. Umm… They often cause drowsiness and impaired reaction times that interact with alcohol and they don’t really give a sense of mastery over the problems. So we wouldn’t be suggesting those as first line treatments. Umm… Antidepressants have been shown to be quite effective. Uh… They’ve been shown to help people to feel uh… much more in control of their anxiety and to be able to go out and do the things that they had previously been avoiding. A drawback with the medication is that studies so far seem to suggest that it only works as long as you take it. And I think that’s a real problem because it doesn’t appear that you could say take it for a year and then you’d be over it. Umm… Unfortunately, there is a very high relapse rate when the medication is discontinued. But certainly, we have to consider particularly in a country like Australia where lots of people, for example, in rural areas don’t have access to cognitive behavior therapy that medication is worth considering. And I also add that very, very many people with social phobia become significantly depressed and in that case, there is a much stronger case for using an anti-depressant medication. 

00:44:15
Setbacks 

00:44:20
ERIC Yeah, there always be times we sort of bite off more than you chew umm… or the circumstances push a little bit further than you want to go and it’s easy to have a relapse during those times when you just want to avoid everything and everyone. 

00:44:45
JON Yes. I have setbacks umm… Oh, I thought life is a setback really. I mean… Umm… Entirely, relatively recently that I’ve had a period where I’ve… where I’ve gotten maybe 8 or 10 weeks without having some sort of a setback. 

00:45:05
ERIC There is nothing wrong with taking a step back and moving forward enough to challenge yourself, enough to feel the discomfort, to feel umm… moderate to high anxiety and once… once your (inaudible) feeling is, then you can use the tools to help control it. 

00:45:35
LISA It… It makes you feel a little bit down ‘cause you think, oh, my God, I’m gonna go back to the same old social phobic person, but you don’t. There’s always ups and downs and getting better. So that was my downer which is having the hot flash and feeling anxious, but, you know, I have to deal with it. Oh, no, I can’t look at myself in the mirror and said, "Well, you’re going right(ph), so what? That’s it." Now I did my breathing again and I’ll go back to normal. I finished off getting my hair done. 

00:45:55
RONALD M. RAPEE The main thing is simply to remind yourself, I’ve overcome this before, I now had to do it, I’ve got the techniques and skills to overcome it and simply go back to starting again at the beginning and work your way through the… the… the techniques that have worked in the past. 

00:46:10
JON When I’m having a bad time I go, well, I haven’t lost all the gains that might so far umm… and that’s… that’s… that’s my experience that umm… that you always you keep the gains you’ve made. 

00:46:25
and so… 

00:46:30
DR. LISA LAMPE You can’t just read a book and you can’t just be told by somebody, you have to learn it for yourself by getting out there and having a go at things that you’ve been avoiding in conjunction with training yourself to think realistically about that situation. 

00:46:45
JON If you progressively exposed yourself to situations, you may well get out into the world, but natural fact, you’re doing it umm… with all these terror uh… leading up to it and… my belief is the terror would stay and you… you sort of… sort of have, sort of a recovery, but by working on your thinking umm… then that sort of uh… sort of quiet and stay on the unhealthy part of your mind and then the combination of the two works really well. 

00:47:20
DR. LISA LAMPE So you… you joined the thinking and the doing to get out there and, and work to uh… overcome your anxiety, well to master it really, so that you can do what you want to do uh… in spite of your anxiety. 

00:47:35
JON Graduated exposure, finding other people who have the same problem, going to support groups, getting professional help. It’s… It’s… You know, it’s not one of them that fixes you, it’s all of those things, you know, and… and for different people there will be different things. 

00:47:50
DR. LISA LAMPE If there is one message about the treatment of social phobia it’s that no matter how long you’ve had it and no matter how bad it seems to you to be something can be done about it. 

00:48:00
LISA Don’t think you’re going insane ‘cause you’re not. There’s a lot of people out there with social phobia and you can’t get better, but you will get better because I ditched and everybody else in my group did, too. So there’s always light at the end of tunnel. Social phobia is not a deadly disease so you can’t get better from it. 

00:48:20
ERIC It’s important to try and do things that umm… you still enjoy, not to spend too much time focusing how much you can’t do and try to spend enough time doing what you can do and following up on those things so that to provide, respite, and a break and also provide a… a feeling of well-being. 

00:48:50
JON Four months ago I went to a support group and I actually shared that I thought although I would improve my life a little I would never recover and I believed for 50 years almost that I would never recover. And in the last four months, I now believe I will recover and function and certainly do everything in the world that that I’ve ever wanted to do because I see… I see a world out there which… which is unavailable to me, which is umm… you know, friends, relationships, social life and I’ve got a sufficient taste of it now to know that is possible and… and whatever happens, whatever negative things happen, whatever setbacks I have, you know, my spirit to get out there and get into it is much stronger, you know, and uh… And I will recover. I’m determined to recover.
