JOHN GOTTMAN And that's why it's very important to really think that there are eight different emotional command systems and they are all important. The other thing abortion focus therapy says quite often is that when people are angry the commander-in-chief, then in fact underneath that is really the sentry it's really about fear. Anger is about fear underneath it quite a lot of the time. And I claim anger is very often about anger, anger is very often about unfairness, injustice in the relationship. If my wife is mad at me because she is doing all the house work and all the child care. She is angry for good reason. As fairness is very important in relationships and I need to really be able to embrace her anger, process that negative effect for attunement. Okay, so I mentioned this because I think that's very important. Also I think really in everyday interaction, empathic residence is a very rare thing. And let me try to prove that to you. And what I'm going to try to prove to you is that the basis of all relationships is fucking up. That rather than thinking that in a good relationship communication is par for the course and if it's not a good relationship then we have a lot of miscommunications. On the contrary, the Sena Quina relationships is screwing up and repairing it. So, let me try to prove that to you mathematically. If you estimate the percent of time that you with your partner that you are ready to listen with an open heart non-defensively, empathetically, lovingly, in a very Christ like way, would you agree the 50% of the time is a generous estimate. Okay. So that's like the probability of flipping a coin and getting a head, right. Now ask what's the probability that both people would be emotionally available, ready to listen with an open heart at the same time. Assuming independence, the probability is 25%. It's like getting two heads, flipping two coins and getting two heads, 0.5 time 0.5 25%. So even with this generous estimate of emotional availability, 75% is right ground for regrettable incidents, where you miscommunicate. And if you take a more reasonable estimate like 30% emotional availability, then 91% is right ground for miscommunication. So my conclusion is regrettable incidents are inevitable in all relationships. It's my job to be the major person in my wife's live that hurts her feelings. That's what she gets for being in a relationship. She is the major person to hurt my feelings and I'm the major person who hurts her feelings. But negative effect just happens. So George Carlin talked about this, the late comedian who said shit happens, we can never see that bumper stick around the Rolls-Royce. That was George Carlin's point. Well, I think it actually happens to Rolls-Royces too. And really being there in the phase of negative effect, my apotheosis is that bonding is created, a tumor is created by turning toward negative effect and fully processing conflict and failures to connect, failures like bids that fail, much more than positive effect systems like orgasm has. And I might be wrong about this, but there are a lot of examples that are bond. Yeah orgasms do create oxytocin and trust and bonding. But exploring in the face of fear, climbing mountains, space exploration. Turning toward a neighbor in the phase of natural disasters like the Joplin, Missouri tornado when I thought it was so amazing that people's houses were leveled by this big tornado that was mile wide and leveled people's whole houses, they lost everything and their neighbors came out. And the first thing the neighbors did, almost every neighbor was to say can I help you, can I be there for you, can I comfort you, it was amazing. And that creates a new town that has a renewed bonding battle buddies in war, which is why the reason coming home from war after deployment is so difficult is that life and families feels totally bland compared to the tremendous bonding that takes place between battle buddies. Nobody goes into war alone, and people going to war and are brave in war to really support their battle buddies, that's enormous. So that when they fight a battle and leaving the socks on the floor when he comes home, thoughts of suicide a bound because it seemed so unimportant. Surviving adversaries like great loss, illness, and hospices for example, orgasm really payout in comparison to this kind of bonding. So the major research finding, another way of saying it is that a tumid is primarily built by processing everyday share. Share is inevitable in all relationships and when reporters ask me what it is that couples mostly argue about. Is it sex, is it money, is it in-laws, my answer is the major thing that couples argue about is absolutely nothing, nothing. They're watching TV and he's got the remote. And he says, let me see what else is on; she says leave it on that channel; he says, well let me see what else is on; she says no leave it and he says fine; and she says what the way you said fine now, that really hurt my feelings. And he says well I said fine because you're going to have it your way, let me watch whatever is on, I want to see James Bond, I don't really watch television with you and he leaves. And what are they arguing about, nothing. But of course there is something there, right. There is some negative effect that happens and it needs to be processed and talked about. What were you feeling, so how do you do that, how do you process? And the answer is that you use the aftermath of a fight. And I will talk about that in a moment. So you really should be asking at this point, what's your evidence. Can you use this processing of negative effect to really change distrust into trust. You are saying that trust is built by really attuning in the small moments of negativity. And the answer is yes, we can, imperially in a randomized clinical trial and with a 100 couples our Art and Science of Love Workshop significantly increases trust compared to a control group. So we get significant increases in our trust metric. We don't know how long these will last though. Okay, but how do we do in the therapy, how do we create a tumid? Trust, remember it's about turning toward our partner, when our partner feels negative effect. And it can't be about, negative effect about us that our partner is feeling or something else. So, okay, that's how we said that, okay. So, what we use to create trust is a blueprint that comes from modification of Anatol Rapoport's work on international conflict and what Rapoport suggested was that the way to deal with conflict constructively was to postpone persuasion until each person can state their partner's position to their partner's satisfaction. So this is like the active listening method, the meringue method; expect it's different in that we give responsibility to the speaker as well as the listener. So if you start harshly, if you point your finger at your partner, and you tell your partner, what's wrong with your partner constructively, you're going to get the Four Horsemen. So in order to have an effective conflict blueprint, you cannot just put all the responsibility on the listener. You need to have the following tasks and this is in your handout you postpone persuasion, the speaker, you do not blame, you use I statements, rather than you statements and you express the positive need which is really what you need, not what you don't need. And the idea is within every negative effect there is a longing, and in that longing there is a wish, there is a hope and therefore a recipe for your partner being successful with you. And what we do is give people clipboards and pens to take notes. And the listener takes notes, summarizes the partner's entire position, not the last sentence the partner said, but the entire position and validates it by completing a sentence like it makes sense to me that you have these feeling indeed because and if the listener, the speaker needs to feel understood, which you say speaker, listener, then we probe them self, okay, and that's on your handout as well. Now when the conflict, however is about these perpetual gridlock problems, we have to use the dreams within conflict intervention. And the dreams within conflict intervention is really not trying to resolve conflict, it's trying to move them from gridlock to dialogue. And they just asked these six questions. The listener has these six questions. What believes and values are in this issue for you? Explain why this is so important to you? Is there a story behind this for you? Is this relate to your history? What do you wish for, what is your dream? Is there a disaster scenario in not having this dream? Okay, those are really hit. Those are the six questions in the dreams within conflict intervention. So far we have talked about, the Gottman Rapoport blueprint which is for current conflicts, the dreams within conflict intervention which is another of attuning when there is gridlock conflict, when it's conflict about an existential issue. For example not just about balancing the budget and about money, but what does money mean. And then the third part of attunement is to be able to process a regrettable incident. And the tool here is this aftermath kit. And let me show you what that is. So this is what we do, this is little booklet that we have and you can order it on our website, gottman.com. It's very expensive though, of course $1.90. That's basically what it cost us to print it. So this has five steps. And it's kind of hard to read this, but I'll read it you and you can see what it's about. Basically, the idea in processing the regrettable incident is that both people need to believe that there are two points of view that both are right, two different perspectives that have validity. And the idea is that you can't process a regrettable incident when you are flooded. You need to have some emotional distance from it. And it's kind of like the metaphor of you being in the balcony of a theatre at intermission, and you're talking about act one expect that you were the actors on the stage, the two of you. And the first thing we talk about is what did you feel in this regrettable incident? So step one is feelings. Step two is what are your realities, how did you – what did you perceive happened in that regrettable incident? And the third step is what are your triggers, what escalated you? So this is Harville Hendrix talks about child advance. And William Faulkner in Requiem for a Nun said the past is never dead, in fact it's not even past. Great line because the trigger is that really saying what escalated you in this regrettable incident. What made you go bananas and why is that a trigger for you? That's the third step. Why is that a trigger for you? What is the story of that? How do you – if you rewind the videotape of memory and stop at a place where you had these feelings in your past, what comes up for you? And what's the story of that? And the fourth step is taking responsibility. Acknowledging your own role and apologizing for what you did to create a miscommunication in the regrettable incident. And this is Dan Wiles at meeting mode and then five constructive plans, how do you make this better next time. And what's different about this little booklet is only that we jumpstart the process, so instead of asking, people will talk about how they felt, we ask them to read the feelings they had. Actually our latest draft, this one has 45 feelings. How did you feel? Defensive, not listen to, feelings got hurt, totally flooded, angry, sad, on love, misunderstood, worried, afraid and so on had no influence. These – so rather than saying what did you feel, we have the booklet and they can actually read, and I think we are up to 56 feelings now. So it makes a little bit easier, just jumpstarts it. And then what are your realities? So you take turns talking about, how do you perceive this, but really not pointing your finger at your partner, saying what you perceived, what you heard, what you remembered, your partner takes notes and validates. And you talk about what you might have needed in that regrettable incident. And the third step is the triggers and wire those triggers; fourth step is taking responsibility and talking about how you specifically contributed to the miscommunication and the regrettable incident and what do you want to apologize for and then constructive plans for dealing with the regrettable incident. This aftermath kit is very powerful, is very emotional and it's the basis for – one of the basis for dealing with the aftermath of an affair. And I will talk about that in the workshop tomorrow, gottman.com. And I give it out to couples, so that they have it and they can use it every time they have a regrettable incident which they will have. So and I tell him the goal of Couples Therapy is not to avoid regrettable incidents and not to eliminate regrettable incidents, they are going to have one. The goal is for them to be able to repair. By the end of therapy, they should be repairing their own regrettable incidents without me, they should be using the Gottman Rapoport blueprint to deal with current conflict, the aftermath is for past conflict. And if they have gridlock conflict, they should be using the dreams within conflict and they should be doing all this without me, but writing me a check. And at a certain point they are going to say, we don't really need him, and we don't need to writer him a check anymore, we can get rid of him. And then we moved to just sort of having checkups every couple of months. Now to building the other part of building trust, is building intimate trust. And for building intimate trust, we really need to help people have intimate conversations that aren't about conflict, they are about understanding each other better and listening to one another. They are about helping each other cope with stress and we learned that from Jacobson's research following up couples that if people – excuse me, if people have the stress reducing conversation, they are much less likely to relapse after therapy. So we teach the stress reducing conversation and extend that ability to listen to all intimate conversations. But as I mentioned, the therapist needs to really be able to build all eight emotional command systems. So building personal sex is a part of this. Viktor Frankl defined pornography as impersonal sex, I think he was right. In pornography you can plug anyone in, any prostitute will do. Although I think it's very interesting, there was a recent study done, I read about it in the New York Times. The sociologist interviewed high price call girls to find out what was the most common thing that their customers wanted from them sexually. And I think about a thousand call girls were interviewed. And the major thing that male customers wanted from high price female call girls was for them to pretend that they were their girlfriend who love them. I think it's one of the saddest things I have heard. So really these guys were hiring women to listen to them and find them interesting to care about and communicate caring and affection and love. So we've created this website called gottsex, g-o-t-t-sex and the gottsex website really talks about creating really love making, it's the art and science of making love. It's about passion, romance and great sex. And these seven skills are part of it. And redefining what sex is skills of intermit conversation building sex love maps by asking questions about your partner's eroticism, your partner's sexual fantasies, building a ritual for initiating and refusing sex, a blueprint for talking about sex, to talking during sex and the solitaire card decks, which have either one, two or three peppers, depending on how hot you want, the sexy things to be. Okay, so that's about trust, but what about betrayal. Okay, so I got a lot of time, so I can tell you about all these research. Betrayal occurs in any interaction that becomes a power struggle. And my definition of the betrayal metric is a zero sum gain. When my gain is my wife's loss, when her gain is my loss, that's the betrayal metric. And the way to measure it is to really look at the rating dials overtime. And as we see here, the blue is a wife's rating dial over their 15 minute conflict discussion and husband's is the red one, totally negatively related, zero sum gain. But if you add them up, it will be a straight line, just a straight line. So, those kinds of conversations I define as being betrayal conversations, even if betrayal hasn't happened yet. Even if there has been the sexual betrayal, having a betrayal metric, -- excuse me, predicts early husband death in our 20 year longitudinal study. The couples who had a betrayal metric 58% of the husbands died in this 20 year period compared to 22% for the couples who had a cooperative metric. And that was true even controlling husbands, age and health, very powerful effect, having a betrayal metric kills men. Now why does it kill men and doesn't kill women. And the answer is that men do not get very much blood pressure protective effect from oxytocin because we secrete vasopressin as well. And vasopressin in rats increases after they have an orgasm, because they don't go to sleep. They are trying to ward off rivals, vasopressin increases aggression. So we're ready to ward off rivals after we have an orgasm. Although many of us find it's possible to not worry about that, so we can immediately go to sleep. So our second study actually found that with a betrayal metric, people's blood is flowing faster. Thank you. Thanks very much. So that actually the mechanism for the early death of husbands may be that there is chronic higher myocardial contractility, other words when you are in a relationship that is not a trusting – is a betrayal relationship, while betrayal is positive that everybody's blood is flowing faster all the time chronically that may be what the mechanism is, which they suggest. So let me skip the slide, I don't like the slide right now. Okay so let's just look at the ball phase part of this slide. So the trust metric was my partner behaves to maximize my payoffs, okay. And mutual trust is we both do that. We both act to maximize one another's payoffs. And betrayal is a zero sum gain. His gain is my loss, my gain is her loss. So now what's related to this betrayal metric, what was related to the trust metric was attunement processing negative effective. So that's how you create trust, but how do create loyalty instead of betrayal. And it turns out, this is the final surprising finding in this research. Is that the germ of this trust is not the same as the germ of betrayal. So in all the literature about trust and betrayal, low trust is almost the same as betrayal. If you don't trust somebody, then it's the same as they might betray you. If you trust them they won't betray you. The surprising finding here is that trust and betrayal are different, different psychological processes and the cascades are betrayal begins with what are called negative CLalt. Okay, now what is that? What a CLalt, what is it, what is a CLalt. Well, the answer is CLalt is something that Thibaut and Kelley suggested in 1959. And it means that I compare what I'm receiving from my wife to alternatives. So let's say I smile at my wife, and she smiles back. Now I might call, well, I love this woman, look at that smile, I mean, I'm one lucky as it will be to have this -- be marry to Julie. I might recall, I could have done better, I saw such a good smile, I smile with a full heart, loving smile, look what I get back is crooked kind of funny smile. And I noticed she is not really that glad to see me at the end of the day. I come in and she hasn't really even pause and she not that happy to see me. So you judge every behavior by comparing it with real or imagined alternatives. So the germ of betrayal, I suggest is when you turned away from a partner's need or their negative effect, with the thought I can do better. That's a very simple idea and it was first suggested by Thibaut and Kelley. So Julie and I the case we worked on, when we were doing the assessment, standard Gottman Assessment, we esteem about what the presenting problem was. This husband and wife just had a baby recently, the baby was about six months old. They guy travelled a lot, he worked in Seattle, but he also travelled to Vancouver, he was in Vancouver half the time, and Seattle half the time and he said I have a mistress in Vancouver. And we are asking about what are your goals to the therapy, why did you come to therapy, what's the story that brings to therapy. And she said, I'm really unhappy in my marriage and my husband has been very cold to me since the baby was born. I really want to work in improving communication and he said I don't really know if I want to stay with my wife because my mistress is much more, much less negative than my wife. And when I see my mistress in Vancouver, she is cheerful. Guy, she has a child, but she doesn't require anything of me. She takes care of her child and she is always ready to have sex with me or make me a great meal or rub my back and be nice. But when I come to see Adeline, I come home from work, my wife says, she is tired, she wants me to take care of the baby and work with the baby, she wants to rest and she doesn't want have to sex, and she says, well I love much Lobito since I had the baby and he said, yeah, well the mistress, she got lots of Lobito. And of course we said well, we don't think this therapy as a chance of being successful. All right, all right, but here is another example of a couple, this is less extreme example of CLO. So I was the sex therapist this couple had. Of course, I thought I was going to be successful where the other weren't successful, right. And then fifth session, the husband came in and said, this is our last session, we're done. So I said, well, I have a 24 hour cancellation policy, you've already paid for the session, you have baby sitters. So would you please stand help me understand why my therapies fail with you. And they said, okay, they would, so we started talking about their weak and we processed an argument they had, so they had a regrettable incident during the week. They went to a party and he met a woman at the party, and he had this great conversation with her. He's really enjoying it and his wife capped him on the shoulder and said, I'm tired, I want to go. On the way home, he said, I was really enjoying that conversation with that woman, she kind of turned me on and I think she was a lot sexier than you are. So they had an argument. And as they were arguing she thought he is so selfish and she said, I would be a lot happier with a more matured man, because every time they argued, he was always trying to get the best he could in this relationship. So both in this regrettable incident, both had turned away from their partners need with a negative opt, okay. She, when he said he was attracted to this woman, she did not say, okay, well let's talk about our sex life because we haven't talked in a long time and you know when I do get the feeling that not you are attracted to me and I'm upset about it. And when he argued, their argument, she was thinking, I don't want to deal with your negative effect, they both turned away, I can do better. So I said to them, they could go now, I was done, I now want to sit with the Y therapy did not work for them and they could go. So thank you very much for being here, you can go now. And they said, they wanted to know why I knew, so I said, did you ever read the book Alice in Wonderland and said, yeah, they have read, I said, the thing about Alice is that when the white rabbit goes down the hall, Alice does not peer over the hole and say maybe I could do better than this white rabbit. Tomorrow there might be a really more interesting white rabbit. And this hole looks kind of dirty, I could get my dress dirty, she just jumps down the hole and that's her journey, she is in wonderland and it’s, that's her journey. And some of it some of wonderland is awful, the red queen is there, she cuts of people’s heads, and some of its fabulous, she leaks the cat, and the caterpillar and the mushroom, that's her journey. But you guys you guys never really married each other, you guys, are always thinking that something better can come along. And you are always really negotiating conflict to get the best yield you can get regardless of the effect on your partner, that's what characterize your conflict. And you're always thinking you can do better. So you never, you have two children and a house marriage and you never really had any commitment to one another. And two months later I called him up and I said, I was wondering if you guys are still together and they said they were kind of stunned by my last session and they now had another therapist and they are working on this idea of commitment. Okay. So negative, so the hypothesis here turns out to be supported by the data is that negative CLL ALT, negative comparisons, unfavorable comparisons begin a cascade to betrayal. And even though T. Bore and Kelly suggested this concept in 1959 in applying games theory to social relationships, Kaarel Raspel is the first person who measured it and Kaarel Raspel died about three years ago of breast cancer at age of 51. But she did 30 years of research on this concept of CLL ALT. And it’s interesting to me that lot of therapists had never heard of her she is a very shy person I gather, I never met her. But she has done the only research that I was able to predict sexual infidelity. All the other research on sexual infidelity starts with the affair and yes people to retrospectively recreate what happen. We know that people's retrospective accounts are highly flood, they would present themselves, all right. So but Kaarel Raspel really was able to predict that and because of her research I was able to use her measures of CLL ALT in my own research looking at the kind of observational work and physiological data and the rating dialed it, Bob Levenson and I developed to try to relate the betrayal metric to this cascade. And so it turns out that there really are orderly, deterministic cascades toward betrayal or loyalty that are really glacial in a relationship and I have laid this out as 24 steps. So now, so why 24 steps, well, the more specific you can get about the cascade toward betrayal in a relationship the more you can understand it and do something about it. Okay. So here is what happens and I don't know if it’s hard to read that, but the first step is really turning away from your partners negative emotion, turning away, just missing it and not a tuning. And the second step is really not being there for your partner that becomes a common event of not a tuning, sorry. Okay, that's followed by physiological arousal, okay, remember the simulator. So that goes along with it, there is an empirical finding. So when people turn away from you, you actually have increased physiological arousal and flooding. Then conflicts starts becoming an absorbing state, the probability of entering negative effect is greater than the probability of exit or repair doesn't work. So the couples starts avoiding conflict because conflict sucks when it’s an absorbing stay, they suppress emotion, they may have big lobs, but they really start avoiding conflict because it’s so unpleasant. Conflict avoidance is a very big part of every affair. Not only is conflict avoidance is a big part of every affair, self-disclosure avoidance is a big part of every affair. So when you don't talk about what you are upset about, when you don't bring your shear to your partner another way of saying that your negative effect. Then you have a secret you are keeping thing secret from your partner and the tragedy there is that your partner doesn't get a chance to turn toward you, even if your partner hasn't toward you a lot, your partner gets no chance if you keeps your need secret. And then step seven as trust is eroding, negative CLL ALTs start to accompanying, your keeping those secrets and turning away from your partners needs as well. The eighth step is that you start not making as many bids for connection. And you start investing less in a relationship. And you decrease the amount of dependency you have on the relationship forgetting these met. So every single I guarantee you that every single couple you will see where there has been an affair, they are substituting what's not there in another relationship, they are thinking these thing I can't get in this relationship, so I'm not going to ask for them. I'm going to try to find them in other relationships, somebody interested in me somebody wants to play ball with me, somebody wants to sail with me, somebody wants to get kayak with me, somebody wants to laugh with me, go to movies with me, and there is this theory now I can't get this in this relationship. So the partner doesn't get a chance to sign for you if you're looking for that elsewhere. And there is less sacrificing for the relationship, that's the eleventh step. Now not sacrificing is much for the relationship, less sacrificing for the relationship. So sacrificing for the relationship is the opposite of betrayal because it’s really putting your partners need ahead of your needs, all right. And in a trusting relationship people not only are looking out for their partners need, but sometimes they're actually putting their own need second. Okay. Twelfth step is starting to maximize the partner's negative traits and minimizing the partners positive traits. That is the opposite of cherishing, so love and cherishing is a process of maximizing your partners positive qualities and minimizing your partners negative qualities. You're really saying I love this person for these things and they are wonderful and I'm so lucky to have those things, when you cherish your partner. But when you're cherishing your partner you're doing the opposite, sorry. So this is trashing versus cherishing and cherishing is something that can be ritualized in a relationship, Jews have a way of ritualizing cherishing. So every Friday night in our house, there is a ritual and part of the ritual for welcoming the Sabbath is the husband needs to sing a song to his wife called the woman of valor and its comes from Proverbs 30 and the woman of valor and its very moving and sometimes it’s hard to get through it without getting choked out and it’s really singing what you cherish about your wife, there is no such ritual for the wife doing it to the husband, but I think you man are little more vulnerable to this negative CLL ALT thing. The fifteenth step is trashing your partner to others not just in your own mind, but now complaining to others and surely Glass wrote about this in her classic book which was her magnum opus of her life, she also died very young of breast cancer, Shirley Glass is the, was the mother of Ira Glass from this American life on NPR, if you like that show, surely the Glass family is pretty amazing. Philip Glass was an uncle, the composer. So Shirley Glass wrote a book called not just friends, which is a brilliant book about affairs and infidelity. And this idea of trashing the partner to others is a very big source of regrettable incidence when trying to help the couple heal from affairs. And basically what gets nurtured here is resentment versus gratitude. So the people are really nourishing their resentment towards what's not there versus their gratitude for what is there. And people get lonely in the relationship, they are not really trying to get their needs met, they wind up having low Lobito, having less sex, having less fun play, romance they are not quoting their partner anymore, there is not very much adventure, they don't know much about their partners dreams or what their partner sexual needs are, fantasies are. They're really beginning to live parallel lives and they are fewer pro relationship cognizant, few thought, fewer thoughts that this relationship is great and they stop integrating alternative relationships. So rather than creating a wide friend fence between themselves and others, they are now thinking well, other relationships might be better. And they start really removing this fence between self and others. Shirley Glass talks about this as reversing walls and windows so what she meant by that was most couples when they have a trusting relationship where there is no betrayal is sort of stands shoulder to shoulder looking out the window from their house right. So there really they have a window into each other and to each other’s personality, in to each other’s internal world and there is a fence between, there is a wall between them and the rest of the world, but when there is, when this began to get reverse, then there is secrets from the partner and once you start confining and others, then they have a window into your relationship and your partner does not have window into that fighting. So they keep more and more secrets from their partner, they start actively turning toward others and finally they allow themselves, give themselves permission to cross boundaries and real betrayal than on faults, okay. So we can now use this knowledge of these cascade betrayal to prevent betrayal and create loyalty because loyalty is the opposite right, loyalty is the positive CLL ALT the cherishing, magnifying your partners positive qualities, minimizing your partners negative qualities, trying to get your needs met in the relationship would be called effective dependency right, all relationships involve dependency. There is only effective or ineffective dependency. So we know how to do that now and we know to create trust and we have a theory for how to create loyalty and reverse the processes of betrayal, but we know the least about healing from betrayal. There are only two studies that have ever been done, one by Andy Christiansen and one by Don Balcom, no control group, no randomized clinical trial has ever been done. So we need to blend research with practice based evidence, blended, those two sources of wisdom. So here is our best guess about how to do this and with betrayal when we go back to the sound relationship house, we know that really all levels of the sound relationship house have been shattered, constructive conflict management, I don't understand you at all. There is conflict all the time, we know that the betrayed person really has a post-traumatic stress disorder. The shared meaning system has been shattered, what do you value, what about our history, what's right has been the inception, who are you, the friendship system is relevant, all the specific processes, all seven processes of the sound relationship house are shattered. So the therapy that we've created that Julie and I've created, we call a tone, a tune and attach, so it’s a three stage therapy. And the first stage, the preliminaries to the first stage is our standard assessment with our questionnaire package, a conjoint interview and oral history interview, looking at how they deal with conflict, individual interviews. But we have to really make sure the affair is over, really over. If it’s not over, couples therapy is contraindicated. And then we have to set up transparency and verification methods if the affair is over. I don't know how many of you've been lie to that the affair is over, I have several times working with couples to try to help them heal from an affair, but it’s a lie. And Don Balcom even refers to the idea that the couple creates a fund for a private investigator. Now here is an interesting thing, lot of people find they are really repulsive, they create a fun for private investigator. If the affair is over, my experience says, if you suggest a fun for a private investigator and the affair is over the person who has had the affair will say, I think its waste of money, hurts my feelings that you don't trust me, but I can understand why you don't, I had an affair, if it makes you feel better and it’s going to make you trust me more, hire a private investigator. When the affair is not over, the response is invariably, I'm mortally offended that you would think that I would lie to you and betray you. So this is really a kind of cool test to suggest the mutual fund for a private investigator. And my wife hates that idea, she thinks it’s disgusting. I think its kind of cool. So I mean we don't actually agree a lot of the time about how to do things, but Don Balcom suggested this and I found that when you actually suggest this is an idea and you can even say, this is kind of weird, but I've had a number of cases where people said the affair is over and it’s not and I think you really want to create trust and create verification and transparency, just like when two countries are trying to negotiate about the disarmament they want to make sure that they are both disarming and what I'm not going to get nuclear strike, so they have to have verification and it’s going to build trust, let's what do you think about hiring a private investigator. And it seems to be a very good test that if the affair is over, person says, waste of money, but go ahead and do it. If it’s not over person says, that really hurts me. I don't want to be a part of this therapy if there is going to be a private investigator fund, okay. So anyway that's the only way to know. And you mainly also individual sessions with the betrayer, part of what's happening for somebody who gives up an affair is there is a lot of grief about giving it up, there is loss. And you need to really build an alliance with that person as well as the other person, the hurt partner. So you outline the therapy, the atonement face of therapy is really important and the atonement dialogue has been described by Peggy Warn's research, I was able to help her design a questionnaire for that study, but she really looked at anonymous responses to this questionnaire about people who had dealt with an affair, who had an affair and some of them had rescued the relationship somehow, most not with therapy and she tried to find out what the characteristics were. And her report is available for free on a website called askpeggy.com, askpeggy.com, you want to read it, and its very good, but it really basically says you've got have to this initial phase where you help, you explore the hurt partners post traumatic stress disorder, explain it to the betrayer and allow the hurt partner to ask questions and help the betrayer to be non-defensive and empathetic as a listener in expressing his or her deep remorse. And you do not examine why the affair happen in this phase, it risks blaming the victim. And the expressions are pain or okay, but not the four horsemen you make sure that the person who is hurt really talks about their feelings and their needs, but not using contempt and defensiveness in criticism. They are really asking what is true, what can I trust, the hurt partner is asking that and again trust is built by a atonement, so they bring their negative effect to the betrayer and they are asking questions, they are trying to find out, they need to talk about it. But the therapist also needs to make sure that the questions are monitored, so it doesn't, they don't get asked at home, they get asked in session and they are not about the details of the sex because if they are about the details of the sex, it feeds into the ruminations of the post-traumatic stress disorder. So you have to really monitor this and it takes, it’s really an art, but that's the first stage, the atonement dialogue. The second stage is a tumor, so remember the conflict of avoidance and self-disclosure avoidance are setting conditions for affairs to happen, right. So we need to end conflict avoidance, we need to set up the rapport blue print for constructive conflict and create a personalized story of why the affair happened and take a look at the cascade toward betrayal, the negative CLL ALT, the investing less in the relationship, the decreased dependency, the destructive conflict discussions and turning away from bids, a couple of then in the citumen(ph) phase really learns how to turn toward negative affect and turn toward bids for connection. And part of what we do is, we set up a weekly one hour sacred meeting called the state of the union meeting, where they talk about what's going right in the relationship, give each other appreciation and then talk about a regrettable incident that may have happened or a conflict discussion using one of those three blueprints either the aftermath of a regrettable incident or the rap report blueprint or the dreams within conflict. And we ritualize cherishing and gratitude during this phase. And the other part that comes out of game theory is to establish norms and meta norms that support the relationship, that means they need to move away from the people who support the affair and who kept the affair secret and start telling people close to them that they are rebuilding their relationship and they need to surround themselves with people who support the relationship and get rid of people in their lives who really have supported the affair, okay. And the third step, the third phase is attachment, so atonement, a tenement and attachment and here we start really looking at the dreams within conflict for perpetual conflicts, they start learning the skills of conversation.

Peter Pearson Ph.D. 

00:53:45
PETER PEARSON Okay. Thank you very much. Hey, it is my pleasure and we have to get going for this great panel today on affairs, the crisis for the couple and challenges for the therapist on my immediate right, Helen Fischer. On my next to Helen is Ellyn Bader, Esther Perel and John Gottman and Boyd, we have lot to cover this morning. My biggest fear of a panel discussion is when one person on a panel says, x and everybody else on the panel says, I agree, so do I, that's nice. I don't think we're going to have that problem today, I really look forward to this discussion and I have a few questions that I would like to ask, but to start with the topic of the panel first of all, which is infidelity creates such a crisis. I'm wondering if all of you the four view see the crisis the same way or is the crisis, do you see the crisis as being from your perspective different, differently. How do you see the, now, here is the other thing all of you could take a whole hour on any of these questions, so guess what I'm going to suggest. Thank you. Go ahead. What is the crisis that you see, when a couple comes infidelity is a problem? 

00:55:15
[sil.] 

00:55:25
Ellyn Bader Ph.D. 

00:55:25
ELLYN BADER I'll start on one aspect of the crisis and first say that I don't like our typical crisis victim perpetuator model, so I'm just say, put that out. But also I think that one of the essence is of the crisis in this culture at this time in history is that, women have fought hard for quality, women were no longer in arranged marriages, were no longer bard, we no longer have dowries, and we fought to get into egalitarian marriages and when somebody, when there is infidelity, when there is lies, betrayal, deception and particularly when there is an affair, someone partner has made a unilateral decision to break an equilateral commitment. And so I see that one of the essence and that we often end up with our clients some other time talking about the wrong things. Because how you repair in a way that builds the stability, if that's what the couple is looking forward to believe that they can have a relationship that in fact not only is repaired but is better that what it was before. It takes a lot of work around realigning that power dynamic. 

00:56:50
 Okay. Anyone else, and just, you guys can pass it back and they can ask questions. 

00:56:55
John Gottman, Ph. D. 

00:56:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, I would say everything is broken, when there is been an affair and it's primarily the deception that creates it, but also the fact that it was, as you say really a betrayal of the contract and I mean it's funny to see, because when you're thinking of how to repair a relationship, you realize that you have to be crazy having a fear, is it so hard to repair it. It just seems like wow, if everybody knew what you had to go through to create a new relationship that you're talking about, because that's what you really do and carefully as you create a new relationship. 

00:57:50
 Yeah, and that's why so many people after an affair has been revealed, go let's get over this fast. Can we get through this quickly, which it doesn't happened quickly. 

00:57:55
Helen Fisher, Ph.D. 

00:57:55
HELEN FISHER Well, I'd like to add just a Darwinian evolutionary perspective. And I'll start off with a short story about Bluebirds. I mean, he was a Bluebird couple and the anthropologist wanted to see what would happen and the male went off to get some grubs or something and the female was sitting at the nest that they were building together and he put a male stuffed feck Bluebird right next to the female, while the male was away and the partnered male came back to the nest and saw this other male next to the female attacked the domain until it was all feathers and just flapped off the bridge. And then he attacked the female and pulled out most of her tail feather, so she would have hard time flying. She fled and was never seen again and two days later he moved a new female in. So this is adultery is not just for the human animal, you take a look throughout nature and this is no joke. And the reason it is no joke is because you are tampering not only with the trust and other psychological cortical issues of the human animal, but you are also tampering with either reproductive capacity. You know, the man stands to be cockled in, the female stands to lose support system and indeed from the Darwinian perspective, I mean, what Darwin said was if you have four children and I have no children you live and then I die out. So the game of love marriage and the game of forming a pair bond and trusting each other matters, it matters for the future of your DNA and we don't take it lightly, no species does. 

00:59:40
JOHN GOTTMAN I think the national enquiry get hold of their Bluebird story and it would spread like wild fire. Esther? 

00:59:45
Esther Perel, MA, LMFT 

00:59:45
ESTHER PEREL Well, I think that it was from you Helen that there is not a single society where adultery does not exist. 

00:59:55
HELEN FISHER Right. I've looked in 42 of them, in every single one of them even where you can have your head chopped off for it, it exists, everywhere in the world. 

01:00:05
ESTHER PEREL So there are eight countries still where women can be stoned or burned her life for being adulteress, it has been historically practiced and university condemned. And so then the question that you're asking about why would somebody want to do that, if the consequences are so dire, may lead us to then really ask it must be that sometimes people long and you're in for something that is so then powerful that they're willing to risk losing everything for it. 

01:00:30
HELEN FISHER And I would, are you through? 

01:00:35
ESTHER PEREL It's the other way around sometimes as well. So that betrayal is always a part of an infidelity, but it is not often the motive, maybe the motive isn't more often more on the side of longing and yearning and often what was described tear about the kind of disconnection that takes place in this gradual infiltration of the parallel life and gradual kind of disinvestment of that person is that very many times we go somewhere else not so much because we want to leave the person that we are with, but we want to leave who we have become. And it's no so much another person that we're looking for, but another self. 

01:01:15
HELEN FISHER And I would like to add that's a various psychological perspective and totally good and I think that psychological and the anthropological work together. But I'd like to add the Darwinian and it comes from something that John, you said during your speech is that glass, surely glass was their first thing. 

01:01:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:01:30
HELEN FISHER She said and it's a very important little, I just did in a matter of analysis of adultery and it's on my website, so it's of all, but anyway they -- one of the thing she pointed out was that when asked why you're adulteress 64%, 54% of men and 56% of men and 34% of women said they were in a happy marriage or a very happy marriage. So why is this? I mean, really why is this. So from a Darwinian and there is genetics to adultery, we can go into that at different time, but bottom line is this got to have been some time in our evolutionary pass that there were some reproductive payoffs to this sort of thing or we wouldn't have a worldwide issue with it. And so you know one of theories that I've offered and others have offered too dialing back to the grasslands of Africa, 2 million years ago, male and a female form a pair bond raise their babies have two children together, but occasionally the male goes over the hell and copulates with somebody else and perhaps by chance two extra children. And the female while he's away, she goes and have some sex with somebody else and gets some extra resources for the children that she already has. And through millions of years of the literally genetic payoffs of adultery, we've evolved in the human animal what I call a dual reproductive strategy, a tremendous drive to pair up and rewrite children as a team and also a predisposition to be adulteress on the side. Now I'm not saying that predispositions are necessarily going to drive you to adultery, I mean, some people have predisposed to alcohol assignments and they give up drinking. But the bottom line is when you see something that is so prevalent around the world, when you see some of the genetics of that prevalence. You have to come up with some evolutionary speculative answers and that's the going one. 

01:03:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Before I met my wife, I work with my parents in Israel and met a whole branch of my mother's family that I never met before they're about 20 people that I met. And they were really every single one of them -- was it jerk? And they're really, I really disliked all of them and they were really nasty people and I was saying and I hadn't had a trail that, I was thinking the world does not need my gene pull, I mean, it's not going to make overall better. So I have a lot of trouble relating to this idea that, we have this tremendous thrive to reproducing and survive have our gene survive. I mean, it's been absolutely wonderful to be a father and have a daughter, who is really great person, really nice person, I've love being a father, I can see the motivation for wanting to be a dad, wanting to be a mom, but I won't understand this wanting to have your gene pull survive, I just, I don't feeling experience with that. 

01:04:45
HELEN FISHER It is too anthropologist sort of divided into proximate mechanisms and ultimate mechanisms. Proximate mechanisms are what you think you want, what you say you want, what you've really want as you've have all said, you know you want excitement or something new et cetera. Ultimate explanations are actually what happens and bottom line is every person in this room is the result of people who had children. And through millions of years, those they did not have children died out and those they did have children live on. So it's not as much what you're thinking about, whether you want them or not, but the bottom line is that drive to have them evolve because those that didn't have that drive died out. 

01:05:35
 So I actually have an extension question on this, which is our profession is going more and more toward research from different fields anthropology et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But my question is this, when the given therapist is working with a given couple in their room in a given painful interaction, what are your limitations of research. If you bring it right down to one couple with one therapist and this couple was having intense paying. What are either limitation to research to help that couple at that time in that situation? 

01:06:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, absolutely, I mean, I think research is a very, very slow process of plagiarizing information from people who know what they're doing. But it's slow and it accumulates very slowly and for to be reliable and useful it takes a long time and we need the intervention of clinicians. We need practice based evidence because we're dealing with very tough problems, I mean, all of the research on couple's therapy the average madarosis faction of the clients is within half of standard deviation away from the mean, but I see couples who are six and seven standard deviations who are the main. So that literature is not very useful, research is not very useful. 

01:07:10
 I really appreciate that comment from you John a lot. 

01:07:10
JOHN GOTTMAN It's very limited. It's very slow. So we need both. We need to know what clinicians know and we need research as well to make sure that we're not assuming that we're right all the time. And so we can be proved around as well. 

01:07:30
 Good. 

01:07:30
HELEN FISHER You know, I think that, I love the question, actually it invites a lot of thinking, right. You are in the room and here's my first doubt when you were talking about this. When you listen to a piece of bark or motor’s. One of the beautiful things is to listen to it interpreted by a number of different musicians. Nobody has ever wanted to say that there is one right way to play motor’s. I think the beauty of therapy is to actually see a number of different musicians, artists, IE-therapists. Work with the same couple and be there and create a different interpretation of life. Bring to people who are in suffering to a different of place of beauty to a different meaning of existence. And research, which likes to become scientific and has kind of become very popular, at this moment and we like the concept of evidence based, but so much of what happens between two people that is important is what is not visible. And how do we research that? So we do, we do the research too, but when I sit in the room, I am really not thinking about research at all. I am thinking about two individuals let's talk about the crisis you asked before. You know the crisis of an affair is not a static thing, it is not the same on the night after, as it is on the site of the -- there is multiple crisis. The crisis of the person who is wondering, how they're going to end the affair or the crisis of the person who realize through the affair that they actually really want to stay in their primary relationship. Or the crisis of a person, who realizes that's this is, this revelation that has just happened, what's probably one of the most important things that happen in the relationship. Betrayal is not only a dirty word, it sometimes is the most powerful thing to shape up a rotten political system. And but you don't know that in the moment, in the moment when you are in the day, so the crisis three months later, that crisis a year later, the opportunities that maybe come from that and even five years later people may still say it was our worst crisis, but what came out of it was invaluable. The word crisis is a flexible term not some static thing that is just fallen on us and that is not so much to be seen in research. 

01:10:15
 I'd like to define some research. 

01:10:25
HELEN FISHER I am more bearing, when I don't see you. 

01:10:30
ELLYN BADER I'm sort of indirectly getting it talk about your question, because I think one of the reasons we have like lots of people who show up for a panel on infidelity and why we are like to talk about it is because it's Darwin Messi and there are no easy answers and in our practices you can have procedures for a lot of things, you do, I mean you can have a 24 hour cancellation policy and you can have, you can have, whether you see people separately or you don't or whatever it is. But when you see an infidelity case you never know what is going to come out to you and you never know from week to week what's going to be the new thing that somebody discovered or the new lives or I mean, and you're always challenged by couples like that to figure out where you stand and it's -- in those moments when I make those decisions, I'm not thinking about research, I'm like the drawing on every bit of clinical experience I have and every bit of knowledge I have about the two people in front of me and doing what I just hope is the best thing at the moment. 

01:11:35
ESTHER PEREL Well, I'd like to define research. 

01:11:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Oh, yes. Go ahead. 

01:11:40
ESTHER PEREL Probably, lot of people know that I and my colleagues put people who are madly love into brain scanner. And the most important thing, I think that we've done, as we put 15 people into the brain scanner, who just been rejected in love. And my hypothesis was, and I generally don't have hypothesis done, I'm just glad that you've said that was that love, romantic love was an addiction, particularly a wonderful addiction when it was going well and probably a horrible addiction when it's going prudently. And indeed we did find activity in three brain regions linked with profound addiction and I would hope that some therapists would take that research another research into mind when they're dealing with a couple and expand their understanding of this further than just your childhood, which is very important and the politics of the relationship, but into the world of addiction, chemical addiction. So I do think that research can expand the clinicians understanding the situation. 

01:12:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, I want to say something about history. There is a great book written by Marilyn Yalom called A History Of The Wife and I think everybody should read it, it was a couple of therapists. And Marilyn Yalom is Irvin Yalom's wife and really terrific is Orion. And if you look at the history of marriage, committed relationships, it's undergone really profound changes in the last 600 years. So in the middle ages, a guy married when he was around 30, and he married a woman who is around 14 and he live to be about 41 or 2. So the marriage lasted 10 to 12 years and then she was windowed and believe of girls admitted widows into the guilt, so that really eventually Europe was being run entirely by widows, they were the innkeepers, the blacksmiths, the millers and so on. And the same thing was true for nobles where the husbands were nights they went on crusades, the women run everything. And so compared marriages that lasted 12 years, so today where marriages come last 60 years and the challenges that you have when the marriage leased out long in our middle ages, people made fun of husbands who were in love with their wives. Luxurious husband was a source of markery in punching judicials, they didn't link love and marriage. Marriage was about stability and property, love was quarterly it was fleeting and now since 1,700, we have the concept of the companion of marriage that last decades and decades and decades, right. Is this a whole new invention and this fidelity and serving all these roles as lover, friend, father, mother and on and on all these different roles over the long life course that's a whole new thing and it's kind of hard to go back to biology and think about what's right, what was right. All of this is changing, historically, sociologically and it's now wonder relationships were falling apart. Does they supposed to do so much for so long. 

01:15:35
ELLYN BADER Well, and now we have in our primary relationship the interdependency in all these areas that you're talking about and none of us ever grow up learning how to be in an interdependent relationship, I mean, all our relationships are higher article and then all of a sudden herein a marriage and you're supposed to automatically know how to be successfully interdependent with somebody. 

01:16:00
ESTHER PEREL I would even add that, I mean, I think it’s' been sorting around at a lot of conversations, but from millions of years, we lived in these hunting and gathering societies. And your partner was one of many people that you've got nurturing from and education from and love from and attention from et cetera, et cetera. And to I mean, this loss of local community and the focus on just the partner being everything as you say everything the most mysterious and also the most stable part of your life is something that human brains not built for. 

01:16:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Right. 

01:16:30
ELLYN BADER One, can I just add one other. Last summer, when we were in Africa, we spend some time with a mass side warrior and he had 42 brothers and sisters and I said, when multiple there were multiple wives and I said to him what was it like each time when your wife came into the family and he's that what do you mean, what was it like and I -- 

01:16:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Well they're asking about jealousy. 

01:16:55
ELLYN BADER Yeah, I asked exactly, I asked him about the jealousy factor and he said there was no jealousy because every time when your wife came into this system, we had more resources and so we were happy that our community had more resources. 

01:17:10
JOHN GOTTMAN That's one hell of a referring. 

01:17:15
ESTHER PEREL On the other hand husbands really are abashed and polite in the societies to pay equal attention to each. So I happen to be doing some international radio on the BBC with a guy from Kenya and he had three wives. So I said to him, I said well how many wife would you like to have. And I was thinking, is he going to say 10, is he going to say 25 and he leaned into his microphone and he said none. 

01:17:40
JOHN GOTTMAN All right. 

01:17:40
ESTHER PEREL So, there is some pressure is there that this guy didn't tell you about. 

01:17:45
 He was the one with the fully with other wives. 

01:17:45
 So, I have a question when we talk about how messi it is in the office there is one more variable, which is most therapists, you know we have some general idea about kind of transference going on in a case of a situation and we try to minimize the effect of negative counter transference. But my question is this. Do you think a therapist should aspire to be value neutral, when they work with a case of infidelity. Should they hang up their judgments, put those judgments in the waiting room, although it's literally impossible to do that. Do you think they should aspire to be value neutral when working with infidelity. 

01:18:35
JOHN GOTTMAN I like that question. 

01:18:40
HELEN FISHER Okay. I will start. No, because I think that you know each of us could probably in having the space of each other and we'll say some of that too, but each of us is trying to add something to the conversation. I think that every therapist is value laden. We come as systems of meanings to therapy. We have an idea, I think one of the dangerous, if I may say of the couple's therapy is that we seem to have become the priests of what is healthy and good, we've taken over the morality that the church has left behind sometimes. And in that sense, it is really -- I would like to be careful do not think that I know what is good of a relationship, what is healthy, who should be staying together and who should not in a good humility will serve me well. Then I sit in front of the infidelity and my first question is to try to understand what does this mean for them. I work across cultures and not in every culture is it the same trauma. Not because the hurt is different, but because the meaning associated to the hurt is different, in the same way that for this man your question about jealousy isn't part of his register. And so I try to see is what do these people experience this event, this crisis in their life to be and it's not one business already at least two people in front of me. Now, depending on the story, I maybe disgusted, jealous, envious, worried about my own marriage, clear about the tediousness of relationships, worried about my age, identifying with the person who had the affair, identifying other times with the person, because I think you know I see this man recently and he treats his wife really awful, awful for so many years, she finally meets somebody who is actually treating her with respect. She may actually must have the strength to leave this man and he is cursing her out in the office and I'm thinking to myself you know I at least them not a slut and I haven't and I'm thinking, but I said maybe you didn't because nobody wants to be with you. You know, you're not such a nice person and I'm thinking betrayal comes in many forms you know who has the superiority of evil here or who has the superiority of victim hood. That other times I'm in church with the person who is betrayed because I'm thinking for God's sake at other times, I'm thinking you know the story of this couple doesn't start with the affair. Now you're crying, but I don't know who you were five years before. So it's layer upon layer and all I try to do is staying touch and checking myself at every time and talking with a lot of other colleagues when it gets complicated it's not often to be done just alone.

01:21:45
 Anybody else on aspiring to be value neutral? Anyone else want to add what you think about that is being-- 

01:21:55
JOHN GOTTMAN One of the things that, that I keep thinking about is research on social epidemiology or which is about 45 years old. Really discovered the amazing health benefits and longevity benefits are well-being benefits, many health is was physical health benefits of a relationship not only marriages but friendships as well where there is commitment, where there is love, where there is understanding, where there is caring and loyalty. I mean, there is an absolute, there's an absolute in terms of what children need from a family and what makes children thrive and there is an absolute about when you get from relationships and appears to be really true across the entire planet. Its cross culturally true, that in cultures where there is community. 

01:23:00
 Well, little let me jump in -- you're talking about whether or not that therapy should be value neutral or --? 

01:23:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, I'm saying is that there is a value -- there are values that are absolute? That it's not relative and in the family where there is no jealousy and the new wife is viewed as a resource. They're able to do something that is pretty amazing. They're really able to create community and support one another and we know that people who are alone and lonely die early everywhere in the planet and that love, the ability to really have love to love not only receive love, but to love and sustain loyalty and commitment is health giving and longevity producing, quite amazing it's you live in average of 10 to 15 years longer. If you're in a loving relationship that's stable. Quite a remarkable fact, not a small fact and the effects on the immune systems have been traced very well, we know what the mechanisms are. So they're really, things aren't relative. Now somebody who can't do that somebody who can't make a relationship work where there is concealment and the absence of loyalty, the absence of commitment and love. That's a sad thing. It really you know is pretty universally said. And I think, Esther is right that are no good guys or bad guys in this thing. There aren't horns and tails on people. But it's always sad when a relationship can't make that happen. 

01:24:45
 Helen, do you have any comments on value-neutral as a therapist? 

01:24:50
ELLYN BADER No, I'd like to get on to some of the nitty-gritty of what goes on in the therapy process. 

01:24:55
HELEN FISHER I would like to just say one small thing on the value thing. I think that one of the -- there are a few key values that we are questioning always when we do couple of step, but they are particularly stronger when you work with infidelity. And they have to do with your believes and your values as it pertains monogamy and the mandate or the absoluteness of the moral categorical of monogamy is one of them. The second one is your belief in the right of the individual happiness at the expense of others to degree to which you think that when you place the individual at the center, you have a different response to what they have done and the consequences that it places to another and versus the degree to which you think the person should sacrifice their individual happiness because of the consequences it has on others. And those values really come to the forefront in full blown light when you work with infidelity more than others. 

01:25:50
JOHN GOTTMAN But when you work with gay couples, you have to realize that medicines classic study found that there was no gay male relationship that had lasted longer than 35 years, that was monogamous. They were all non-monogamous. And they've been able to manage it without deception without cruelty. So it all depends on what you're working with, what kind of relationship you're working with. 

01:26:20
HELEN FISHER Somebody yesterday asked for us to actually be more inclusive on the gay and lesbian situation. I think that this is really one area where straight couples have everything to learn from gay couples. 

01:26:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, correct. Sex is an another area. 

01:26:40
HELEN FISHER I'll talk a length on that one. But it is. 

01:26:40
 Alright. So here is a question which is often when therapist go to conferences, they learn about infidelity we had speakers say, you know here is the theory, here is what we think is behind it, here is some possible ways to look at it, here is some possible intervention and it's thought almost as though therapist are interchangeable parts, you know that they can apply whatever they have is being thought. We're relatively skillfully, relatively easily. My question is this, do you think there is such a thing as traits or the therapist that make them especially better in working with infidelity? 

01:27:20
ELLYN BADER Yeah, the ability to manage a lot of complexity. And I mean, what I'm about to say is not a slur on beginning therapist, but when I'm supervising cases and I saw many times with the newer or younger beginning therapist, what I find is they collude with the person who wants to get over the infidelity quickly or not talk about it this much in the office, because as soon as you get into it, it's complex. And it's messy and you know all the things I was saying before. It's not easy when you have to deal with I mean a recent situation with a couple where the affair is over in one sense but it's not over in his mind, it's not over in his body, it's not over in what he longs for in his memory, what he longs for to be sharing with the women which was actually a professional collaboration and in order to finish processing this, I mean this is a couple who needed to be able to talk about the fact that it wasn't over for him in those ways and there were some ways he was going to have to finish it that were going to be uncomfortable for her and helping them stay in that dynamic tension till they could figure out what was going to work for the two of them is not, and sometimes I can sit there in my stomach or be tied or I'll be going, Oh shit! What am I going to do next? I don't know. 

01:28:45
HELEN FISHER And I think this is super important then I would add to that the word patience. This is not a seven step thing; this is not a ten session thing. This is sometimes one or two years, of a person gradually figuring it out, working it out, maybe ending it without ever revealing it and letting the secret turn into a memory and reconnecting with their partner. But it really is not wanting to rush it for somebody to make a decision so that it can be neat and we need to modulate our impatience at those moments and some nice people come back week after week to repeat the same, you know with this person I feel like that and with this person I feel like that and then you take the triangle and you turn it into these are parts of you and then you take the triangle and you go back to the past and then you tell, men you have done every geometry of this triangle possible and then you know, one day life does something sometimes. It isn't even just a person finally came to life kick something, something of health or child and job and employment, politics, economy. Whatever. 

01:29:55
ELLYN BADER Or both women say you're out of here. 

01:29:55
HELEN FISHER That's right. And then the movement comes in. So patience and complexity is I think. 

01:30:05
JOHN GOTTMAN I think one thing is important to realize is actually the prognosis is very positive. So in Andrew Christian's research and at his work the curve is steeper but they actually couples who have affairs wind up in the same place at the end of their therapy, the same thing was true for Don Balcom's research. So now that those studies have been done, we know it's really hopeful, you really can rebuild the relationship and there is a lot of attachment that is invisible and when people come back, I read somewhere there are only a 11% of affairs actually become relationships, I don't remember where I read this, but trying to remember it, but a very few affairs that actually progressed toward relationships. So there is invisibility of attachment that I think creates a very optimistic prognosis, it's the people who's doing the work on it. Yes, it's complex. 

01:31:05
 That could actually be a very reassuring, that could actually be a very reassuring statistics. You just tell them there is 90% chance this affair is not going to end up in a relationship. God! those are amazing. 

01:31:20
ELLYN BADER But I think one thing that I see goes along with what John is saying is that when an affair is revealed in a couple, the motivation, at least often becomes very high to do the therapy work, whereas in some other couples, you’ve got to work to create the motivation. 

01:31:45
 That's a good point. This is the last question for the pal then, people can ask questions here. Other than what you've already expressed, are there any other personal or professional challenges that particularly bedevil you in working with infidelity situations? 

01:32:05
HELEN FISHER You asked the most challenging, right? No, these are great questions, these are great questions go Helen. 

01:32:20
ELLYN BADER No, I was, well, I'll tell you where my mind went, it went to couple of different places, but one of them was the issue of managing secrets, and you know, I was originally -- and also the issue managing secrets and I was originally trained to never hold a secret. Then I learned, open secrets policy and then I tried using the open secrets policy and then I found my own policy which I liked better than, either of those, but it's not always a good one. So what I do a lot of the time, but I think this is where a good diagnosis comes to play, what I do a lot of the time is, I ask the couple to decide. So I put it out very clearly to them, what do you want a confidentiality policy for the three of us to be? So when I'm with you individually, I would prefer to know, I would prefer that what either one of you told me it could be confidential, but I want you two to decide and so sometimes I bring lot of stuff out pretty quickly when one person is saying, you know, I want it confidential and the other one says I don't want to see her if it's confidential. So that's my policy a lot of the time, but at other times, I know I'm dealing with somebody who's really slippery and I want to be able to see them and confront them, and work with them and then I go back to the open. So I mean it's an issue that I've not a 100% result. 

01:34:00
JOHN GOTTMAN I think being light to is the most upsetting part of this where you do therapy and then you get anemia when one of the people says, I was seeing the other person or I actually met somebody else and started, but we're in therapy so I was managing all these relationships. And then that's depressing that's why I think the private investigator is, it's kind of a nice idea. Private investigator front. 

01:34:30
ELLYN BADER I've got to tell you one other one. I actually, I love this. But this is related to the private investigator. This was a women and a couple who I thought to be one of the brilliant things I've ever seen a women in this situation do because her husband was begging her to be in therapy with him an affair had been revealed and he was saying, please, please, please don't divorce me, I want to be in therapy and she couldn't decide, because she didn't really trust him. So she came back into this next session and she said, I have a solution. I will be in therapy with you for the next year or however long it takes, but if I find out that you're lying to me and we sign a contract, I get 70% of your asset and you get 30. 

01:35:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, that's actually a very common part of game theory is to have a very high cost for subsequent betrayals. And a contract like that works very well. 

01:35:35
HELEN FISHER So I think that definitely, you know, I work the whole time and I didn't know what was what. That's a big one. I definitely, which is why I also have an open secret policy. The question about when the complexities of managing this. But then I thought, very quickly, can if you pass throughout the roll of the x-ray in front of you, what are some of things that are really grappling? Some, and I thought of a situation where a women was in a complete free flow decent and all I could think every week is when is her partner finally going to find out, because nothing will stop her, until he knows. And the terror will kick in, and then she'll get jolted back to reality and I just couldn't do anything. So that's an example. When you just see self-destruction in front of you and you know you pretty much know that only the discovery on the part of the partner will do something. There is another one that is very difficult for me sometimes is when I tried to stop somebody from going into the complete wanting to know all the details and just wanting to flood themselves with complete traumatizing material, and I'm not able to really tell them and slow them down and soothe them and reassure them that this is not the way that they will find any safety stability or trust back. That's another one and then an another one is when people decide that because you have cheated on me, I'm now entitled to know everything about you and I'm now deciding that intimacy is a surveillance system and I find that any totalitarian regime repugnant and so to within an intimate couple. That's the value system as you may have heard. So those are like three where the real challenges of the if you owe me everything, you have no right to any personal boundaries anymore because at this point you belong to me and I have a right, and all of this concept of human rights suddenly entering there with a kind of remorse superiority. I have a hard time sometimes also the last when that came up is when a person won't forgive, even though they really want to forgive, because if they were to forgive, it would be a kind of absolution that whatever you did wasn't that bad. So they will stick it to them self so the rest of their life, just so that the other one will not have a decent night, that kind of what did you call it? The zero sum game of betrayal, that notion, I'll starve myself but you won't be able to eat in peace, as if I'm getting to you kind of thing. And some couples will stay together afterwards, but it's an absolute jail everything you do I remind you, you know you have used up your quota for the rest of your life, talk about contempt, that is so they're together I don't know if that's a successful therapy but, they are together, but man, the contempt and I've got you now like that those ones really I have to do a lot of breathing. 

01:38:50
ELLYN BADER They hurt your stomach. 

01:38:50
ESTHER PEREL Well, one of the problems of course is the with the memory system, I mean, you know there is a lot of estrogen receptors in the hippocampus with memory linked with memory and women do remember, they remember for fifty years, they remember much more than men do. Probably for good evolutionary reasons because they've had life's hardest job of any animal on the planet which is raising tiny helpless babies for many, many years. And so they remember and of course as we talk with each other we count what he did and what he didn't do, creating the memory trail that goes on and on, it is a bit of a gender difference. And it's adaptive sometime to forget. 

01:39:40
 Do you have any questions, are there any questions from out here? Two or three people can raise your hand and ask a question and we can see, maybe we can see the questions are grouped in a short period of time. 

01:39:55
 Yes, can you speak about cybersex and pornography on the internet? Can you speak about cybersex, Internet pornography, fears online? 

01:40:15
HELEN FISHER I think it depends. Get a few more. So let's remember them. 

01:40:30
 I don't have a question on cybersex, I have a question for Helen Fisher. 

01:40:35
 Okay, Hi, Dr. Fisher. I practice evolutionary psychology psychotherapy, couples therapy. So that's basically all I do. So everything you talked about that's what from that model that I practice. I sleep with Donald Symons books under my pillow. Now having said that do you think that it is a value to talk about dis-regulation in the dopamine when people are having affairs, do you think it's important like the valium research from Sweden where you see that there are some men who have a tweak in the allele of manufacturing vasopressin that these men are going to be predisposed having marital discord and possible affairs. I discussed this with my couples. 

01:41:20
HELEN FISHER The question? 

01:41:25
 Is it valuable? 

01:41:25
ESTHER PEREL Just to back up to explain what she's talking about, it's a wonderful, it's a fascinating study in 2008 by the first author as Valium and they had 552 men in Sweden and they looked at a gene in the Vasopressin system and men who had two copies of that gene were far more likely to have a very unstable marriage, if you'd had one copy of the gene you had a more stable marriage, if you had no copies of the gene you had the most stable marriage. And it's the beginning of the understanding of some of the biology that goes under these predispositions for adultery or making solid pair bonds. But to answer your question, I'm not the right person. I'm so fascinated with the fact about that everybody has talked about talking about the effect as opposed to the content and I found with various couple that come to meet, they were actually interested in that kind of data. They actually avoided the research, but I can't say, because I'm not a therapist whether that's terribly effective for most couples. 

01:42:30
HELEN FISHER We're going to right them down and collect a few. 

01:42:35
 Yes, you had touched on the issue of the polyamory when you talked about gay men and the Kenyan men. And I wondered if you think that polyamory is a cultural construct or a cognitive construct that maybe people can shift into and I wondered if in your practices you'd ever seen people explore that after the revelation of an affair. 

01:43:05
ESTHER PEREL About polyamory, the polyamory community apparently likes me, and they like me because we evolve three distinctly different brain systems for mating and reproduction of sex drive, feelings of romantic love, and feelings of attachment. And they feel that they want to sustain their deep attachment for their long term partner and also kind of the intense romance for somebody else. And they have an honest agreement with each other, they make a list of what you can and can't do and they, now my response to that is first of all they put under the cover the fact this is enormous amount of jealousy. The human animal is a jealous animal. Now they seem to be able to either over ride that, but they spend an enormous amount time of time, after the weekend talking about their bad feelings. So it's not as successful as they say it is. And maybe for some people this can work, but the vast majority of human beings is not going to work because we got a huge brain system for jealousy also. 

01:44:20
ELLYN BADER Well, for me the polyamory couples that I've seen who make it were actually the ones with the highest levels of differentiation, because they do have to process so much and they do repair, but they do develop real clarity, so I think for a lot's of people of one work and those who works very well for. 

01:44:40
 Happiest couple, -- can I ask my question? 

01:44:50
 Cybersex. 

01:44:50
HELEN FISHER Okay, I'll say one sentence on the polyamory. Your question specifically is are we willing to take on the possibility of a polyamory's relationship as part of resolution of a working through of a couple that comes in originally around infidelity. That's what I understood your question yes, or no? Whatever. So, but we need to link it to the infidelity thing. I think that probably the most succinct we have seen it is this. There isn't one model for it's all. For anyone who says the polyamory's couple doesn't work, the 50% divorce are mostly not polyamory's and they don't seem to work that well either. I think the piling up of expectations that John talked about is far more, is no different in a way in a polyamory's relationship then it can be in a monogamous relationship. It's still is an it's a different set of expectations but the piling up is taking place anyway. What I would say is that as we are going to evolve, my sense is that monogamy is the next frontier. It will no longer just be able to be assumed, it will become part of negotiation. The same way that we couldn't conceive of premarital sex and it is never given. And we couldn’t conceive of homosexuality out of the DSM and with family and children and martial alike monogamy will be the next discussion for modern love because we just live too long and we want it with one, but we also want all the individualist stuff that our western society has put on us and there are many mono's left. Cybersex. There's a wonderful book, it's Aaron Ben-Ze'ev who's a philosopher of emotions who wrote the book called Love Online. I highly recommend it, because it is a different prospective than what we tend to always talk about, for example he has one of the most interesting description of intimacy online and why it often is actually is more intimate. But he looks at it by talking about how on the one hand it's more intimate and less stable. It is more intimate because you reveal a lot more things much sooner outside of a context. It is much less stable because it could also disappear at the same time. And in the book he gives it to you in a real kind of dialectic way what you have and what you don't have co-existing at the same time. And what he's looking at specifically are affairs online, not sex online, love online. And I think, it's an important thing to separate. Sex online is one kind of experience, love online is a whole other kind of experience. You know, this is an imaginary fictitious story between two fictitious people who experience a real emotion. It's the kiss that was never given, but everything inside of you is as if it took place. That virtual cyber space is a whole new reality we haven't really begin to get a grasp on. 

01:48:05
ELLYN BADER And I think it's really part of what the marriage officer call in the marriage revolution and in fact they've even said that it's going to have a more powerful effect on the future than the industrial revolution, because what we're really doing is shedding 10,000 years of the agrarian tradition and all of the belief systems that go along with it in fact I would even say we're moving forward to the kinds of relationships that we may have had a million years ago in which there is more autonomy between this sexes and all kinds of new things, because it's a wonderful time to be a part of this motion forward, I mean it's a dramatic change in human affairs. 

01:48:45
 Thank you Helen for wrapping it up on such a great note and thank you all for a great fast hour of discussion. Thank you all. Yes, you guys rock.
