DAN AMEN Thank you so much. I'm grateful to the Erickson Foundation and grateful to Jeff and Kaylee and all the people who've put this on. This is actually a more emotional talk for me than I wanted to be. I always say I know more about ADD than I want to know. uh… I've been married twice and both of the women I've been married to grew up in a really chaotic ADD families and they ended up with a touch of it. And so when I was a psychiatric resident, I studied it and lived it. So I know more about this than I want to, but I want to start with my first couples, the first couple that I scanned. So let, let me talk to you a little bit about Bob and Betsy, they'll set the tone for ADD and intimacy. Umm… They first brought me since 1991 that's the year I started our brain imaging work. I'd been a psychiatrist for nearly a decade, but I never looked at anybody's brain. And as soon as I started looking at them, I went the whole paradigm I've been taught was wrong, and it was really irritating because, you know, at this point I'm a double board certified psychiatrist, and I spent a lot of time training. And I'm also child psychiatrist and they brought their two children to me, one was five, a little girl that was having trouble in school and one was seven, a little boy that was oppositional, argumentative, hyperactive, impulsive, and it was really clear to me if you would diagnose him from the DSM that he had ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder, and the little girl had inattentive ADD, and on a little bit of medicine she did great but he didn't. And as I got to know him, I'm like, I'm missing something, what am I missing. And as I saw him in therapy, I realize, I came to realize quickly his parents hated each other. There was a lot of drama at home. There were doors being slammed, there were threats of divorce. There was screaming in the home and he was completely anxious and freaked out about what was going on, but he was also conflict driven. He was stern stuff up, he was excellent at getting his mom to scream at him. So he knew how to push buttons. Now, I had already been in psychiatrist for almost a decade, so I began to recognize ADD patterns in families and I met with the parents. After I saw him about five times, and I said, part of his problem is the family, it's your conflict. And I was young and much more naive than I am now, and I'm like, I want to see you guys and help you with your relationship because how you're acting with each other is bad for the babies. And her comment to me was Dr. Amen, we really like you. We've seen for other marital therapists. They always make it worse. And I told you, I was young and more naive and I'm like, in my head I'm thinking, well, maybe you just haven't seen anybody really good. Anytime you get that idea, you should shock yourself, right, take a knife, put it in the electrical outlet and get rid of that thought because that thought won't help you. And so they agreed to come and see me and at the time in my office I had two blue leather couches, and they sat on the opposite end of each couch. It's a bad sign in marital therapy. And the wife has a PhD in grudge holding. Oh, my God, on and on, over and over about the same thing his mother did 12 years ago that she couldn't let go of. And in my mind, I'm thinking, you're not just going to beat things to death. You will beat them into the afterlife. And she's married to a guy I ultimately called the sniper. Because he's always late to the session, he's always in a hurry, they always drive separately, and whenever she settles down, he says something so evil, so awful just to get her going again. And after about three months of seeing these people, I lose hope, I'm going to help them. That's a bad thing for a therapist. And after about six months, but I'm persistent, you know, it's a good trade and a bad trade at the same time, right, if you're too persistent you become a stalker. Right, so persistence is not necessarily a good thing. And after about six months, I start having physical stress symptoms when they're, I know they're on my schedule, but I'm fighting for these children, right? I mean, I'm just irritated with the couple, but I'm fighting for these children. And after nine months, I'm in the shower getting ready to go to work and I realize there on my schedule and my stomach starts to hurt, which is where I feel stress, and unlike, today, you're going to tell them to get divorced because it's not good for children to be raised in a family with chronic conflict and they're failing, their fifth marital therapist. How many of you grew up Catholic? Wow. Okay, I grew up Catholic. And so only the Catholics are going to understand what happened next. So I get this thought, today, I'm going to tell them to get divorced, and then I got, get a visit from the Catholic voice. What? Because you are not a good enough therapist. You're gonna tell them to get divorced and damn their eternal souls to hell. See I grew up in the 50's where this was like, divorce was like a very bad thing, and I just after the voice yelling at me, I stared at the water faucet for like five minutes wondering how much therapy does this take for me to get over. 

00:08:10
[sil.] 

00:08:15
DAN AMEN Like my mother was not kidding Catholic. I was an altar boy. I actually thought about being a priest until I realized with my last name father Amen, I'm like, no one is going to believe that. 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:40
DAN AMEN And so I got out of the shower, dried off and went over to the phone and I called my friend Jack Pauli, and Jack own the imaging center. So we had started imaging about six months earlier and I completely became in love, I fell in love with the brain, and looking at the brain of myself, my wife, my children, my friends who needed scans. And I was becoming a better doctor because I was looking at people's brains. And so I go over to the phone and I say, hey, Jack. Will give me two scans for the price of one, and he's like why? I said, "Jack, I have this couple and I don't know what to do with them, and I'm failing and I hate that." And he said, "You want to scan a couple." He said, "You know, I've been married twice and I can't figure it out." He said, "Maybe we could do a side business and call it BrainMatch.com." 

00:09:50
[sil.] 

00:09:55
DAN AMEN And when I saw them that afternoon, and I told them I wanted them to get scan because I knew we were not making progress and I was getting frustrated, I wasn't helping them more. They were like all in, like they didn't care what it costs because they knew they were headed for divorce, and their divorce would not have been a good divorce. They would've been getting divorced for decades because she has a PhD in grudge holding, and he is the sniper who's always stern stuff up. And so they got scanned, I went over to the imaging center and he had a floridly ADD brain, and I'm so irritated with myself because I should have picked that up. Always late, conflict seeking, two ADD children and just by random chance, if you believe in random chance, the night before I read an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry on spec, if their cingulate gyrus is overactive, hers was. That's what gave her the PhD in grudge holding. When your cingulate works too hard, that's that racing stripe going down the middle of her brain. You're worried, you can't shift, you get stuck on things, you get the same thought in your head over and over again, you hold grudges, you are argumentative and oppositional. It's not good. You explode when things don't go your way. And just by random chance, I read an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry that said Prozac calms down the cingulate gyrus. And so when I met with them and explain their scans to them, I put her on Prozac, I put him on Ritalin. You could just see the stress go out of their faces as they began to have a completely different understanding of what was going on between them. And so I put them on the medicine and then I said, "Look, I don't want to see you for a month, I need time to heal." 

00:12:20
[sil.] 

00:12:30
DAN AMEN And when they came back, they sat on the same couch. First time she had her hand on his leg, that's a good sign in marital therapy. And we had like 10 more sessions and that was it. The little boy got better, the little girl stayed well, and they're still married today. I did Couples Conference in San Francisco last year, they came 24 years later. If you don't look at people's brains, how do you know. It is so easy to call someone bad. It is so easy to call them a personality disorder which I think is shaming and demeaning. I'm not a fan, but if you don't look, you don't know. We have to stop lying about that. No questions because I've got a lot of slides. I am going to show you some of my journal. So I keep a journal for what patients tell me uh… after treatment this is another patient, my husband said, he doesn't have the knottiness stomach anymore. We're closer than we've ever been. I'm able to handle situations where I used to be hysterical. I used to think I was stupid. It seemed everyone else could do more than me. I'm starting to believe that there may be intelligent life in my body. When you have ADD, there are so many emotional issues that go along with it. But let's start with a little bit of the biology in hundreds of published studies, ADD is shown to be decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex basal ganglia and cerebellum. Uh… Primarily the prefrontal cortex, so you should know just a little bit about it and I'm sort of irritated. For most therapists they don't get any information on neuroscience and that, I mean ultimately the brain is your organ, that's what you're dealing with, you should know a lot about it. Umm… We actually run a training course or brain health coaching course because therapists need to know about this. So first thing, prefrontal cortex, why should you care? It's the front third of your brain and it is Jiminy Cricket in the movie Pinocchio. So do you remember the movie Pinocchio. What was Jiminy Cricket? Pinocchio's conscience. It was the little voice in Pinocchio's head that helped him decide between right and wrong, and it helped Pinocchio reach his goal. So what was Pinocchio's goal? To be a real boy and in order to be a real boy, I had to be a good boy. And when Jiminy Cricket got pushed aside, Pinocchio almost lost his life, that is your prefrontal cortex, don't damage it. Dudley Moore once said "The best car safety device is a rearview mirror with a cop in it." Your prefrontal cortex is the cop in your hat. So it's called the executive part of the brain, like the boss at work it's involved in things like focus, forethought, impulse, control, organization, planning, empathy, insight and learning from the mistakes you make. When you have trouble in this part of the brain and people have ADD, often have trouble with it their whole lives, it's harder for them to be successful. It doesn't mean they can't be. Many of them were wildly successful. Time Magazine said, "Bill Clinton was only a pill away from greatness," and they meant Ritalin. So you can be wildly successful but the cost to your health, to your family, to your success is often enormous. So let, let us get on the same page as far as do you have ADD, the first symptom is short attention span, but not for everything, it's short attention span for regular routine, everyday things, distractibility, disorganization, poor follow through and impulse control issues. If you have three or more and they interfere with your life, you get the diagnosis of ADD. So let me just expand on this a little bit, so it's short attention span but not for everything, it's short attention span for regular routine every day things, homework, paperwork, chores, housework. For things that are new, novel, highly stimulating, interesting or frightening. People with ADD can pay attention just fine and because like the second George Bush. He said, "Why I didn't do well in school was, he said, well, I could pay attention if I'm interested." It's the classic response from many ADD people, and in my head I went, not two ADD presidents in a row. So they also find themselves excitement seeking, drama driven who is running with the bulls. This is not the sign of good frontal lobe function. This is a sign of bad frontal lobe function. There is a lack of forethought, judgment, impulse control, who goes to scary movies. Why? And it's just not saw one, it saw one, two, three, four, five, six in 3D. I'm friends with Harvey Weinstein and when he produced Piranha 3D. I just saw the trailer for it and I just send them an e-mail all capitals, WHY? And he writes back because it sells. Because there's a lot of ADD people in our society. They engage in high-risk activities and they are so much more focused when they are pissed off. They almost need to be mad in order to concentrate, and they're easily distracted. They see too much, they feel too much, they hear too much. If their clothes are not perfect, it bothers them and as little kids actually, their parents worry they're going to be strippers because they just take off their clothes because the seams bother them so much and because of the distractibility, there is a lot of sexual problems in ADD relationships. I love this picture. 

00:19:45

00:19:50
DAN AMEN What does an orgasm require? Focused. You have to pay attention to the feeling, long enough to make it happen. And if you can focus and you're distracted by this noise that smell whatever, it's very hard to have an orgasm. Umm… Organization especially for time and space. People with ADD are often late. They often actually don't get ready to go until they are late. If you have an anxious spouse, it just makes them crazy. It's… there are a lot of fights over time and space, so here's an emergency room doctor in Washington. Umm… his wife had read my book Healing ADD and said, "I made an appointment for you at Amen clinics," and he's like, "I'm not going to see a psychiatrist, there's nothing the matter with me." And she said, "I knew you would say that, so I've already seen an attorney. So you have a choice, you go get this thing assessed or I'm divorcing you, I'm not kidding." So she was actually really good with boundaries and then in my office he's like, "I got through medical school, how could I have ADD." I said, "You know, my five best friends got through medical school, they have ADD too." I said, "How's your office?" He says, "Perfectly organized." She smacks him, she goes, "Why are you lying to him?" And later in my email, I got this picture, this is his definition of an organized office. My wife Tanna who I adore has ADD, I've known it forever, and she never made a cabinet door she actually wanted to close, and it was just like so irritating and… 

00:22:05
[sil.] 

00:22:20
DAN AMEN So people with ADD are often really smart. So she actually taught our dog Asler to close them. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
DAN AMEN Isn't he beautiful? I love him. For people who have the over focused type of ADD, they have islands of organization. So if you go in their living room, for example, it's perfect. So if my first wife had the over-focused ADB. The cat even then go into the living room because he would have to get the roller out and roll up the hair, but if you went into a closet like stuff would just fall on you, right, so part portions organized portion completely disorganized, and people with ADD their follow-through is awful, because they'll do something as long as it has intense interest, and as soon as they lose interest, they'll stop. So a lot of things end up to be 60%, 80%, and then, and then they just stop. I ask one of my patients, he is here with his… was here with his wife. I said, "How many projects did you start last year?" He said, "About 300." I said, "How did, how many did you finished?" And then she interrupts, she said, "Three and none of them were for me." I mean, so you could see that there were issues and then there are impulse control issues, right, I mean your frontal lobes, that's the break in your brain, it stops you from saying things or doing things. Jerry Seinfeld once said, "The brain is a sneaky organ. We all get weird, crazy, sexual, stupid, violent thoughts that no one should ever hear, but they get out and they hurt people's feelings, and it causes a lot of pain in these families. So when I think of impulsiveness, they're often brutally honest. How do I look in the skirt? Like the back of a school bus. Not helpful, not awful confident at all. They have affairs. I had one ADD guy, had been married 11 times because he couldn't stay faithful. But, you know, I mean as mental health professionals we were taught how to reframe things. And I'm like, damn, you're really good at getting women. Steve's actually a friend of mine and we were having lunch. Steve is married with two teenage children and he's like, "I met this really pretty woman at a conference, and we're on the same flight coming home. And she's been by my office to visit. And internally, I'm horrified because I know his wife, I know his family situation." And I'm like, "Steve, are you paying attention to what you're saying?" He's like, "What?" I said, "If you're not careful, you're going to be losing half of your net worth and visiting your children on the weekends, and he had completely not put that together that his behavior was taking him to an affair and given his ADD, he is not going to be good at covering it up because of his lack of follow-through. And it just wasn't registering. They get into trouble by spending money. People have ADD file for bankruptcy way more than other people. Quitting jobs, I would show it if we had time, but the opening scene from Mrs. Doubtfire is the classic adult ADD opening where he just… You know, he's hired, he has a job, doesn't want to do what the director says and quits, and then led to the movie which is really about ADD and adults in a lot of pain. Umm… other relationship issues, people have ADD are conflict seeking. They actually play this game. I write about in Healing ADD called Let's Have a Problem. If things are going nicely, if they're on vacation and there's actually no reason to have a problem, they will start poking and finding problems as a way to stir stuff up. When you have low frontal lobe function, you don't like how you feel. Now you don't know this, it's not conscious. And those of you who have ADD and you're listening to me and you're going, no, I don't do that. I had at least ask your partner. Do I do that? And if you trust them, maybe they will tell you the truth. What is the medicine we use to treat ADHD? Stimulants. Why? Because they stimulate low activity in the prefrontal cortex, and without that stimulation, they stimulate themselves and often it's with conflict, it's with fighting, it's with turmoil. And the problem is, and I was chief of domestic violence at Fort Irwin, the last military place I was stationed. And what I often found, the guy had a head injury and the wife had ADD. So he had no ability to control his impulses and she was pushing all the wrong buttons and getting well was not just demonizing him, but was understanding the whole system and get everybody's brains better. So I know it's not a popular thought that sometimes abuse, it happens because of the person being abused. My experience, you have an ADD child, they're conflict driven, they're much more likely to be abused because they play the game, let's have a problem. I bet I can get you to yell at me, and I've witnessed it for decades. A fun, fun story, Allen and Rachel came to see me, she's 5'2" he was 6'8", I thought that was funny. And as they sat down on my blue leather couch, she said Dr. Amen, you have to help us. He's going to kill me. And now all of a sudden, you know, I'm not smiling anymore and I'm like, "What do you mean?" He likes to scare me. What do you mean? He'll hide around a corner, and as I walked down the hallway at home, he'll jump in front of me just to scare me, and he's smiling. she said, "Dr. Amen, I have a heart arrhythmia now. He needs to stop this." And he's smiling and when we scanned him, he had terrible frontal lobes. He was using it as his form of stimulation. And so I'm feeling good about myself, I'm going to save this woman's life. Put him on medicine, follow-up appointment, the other things we do, and then it's lunchtime, and I'm done, finished my chart, I go out to my car, he's out there, and he has a pickup truck, and in the back of the pickup truck is a golden retriever. And he is teasing the dog. And I'm like, "Allen, why are you teaching the dog?" He's like, "I'm not teasing the dog, the dog loves this." Well, I had a golden retriever at the time, the retriever did not like the behavior. So in the parking lot I raised his medicine. I'm gonna save this woman's life and this dog sanity. 

00:30:45

00:30:50
DAN AMEN They're excitement seeking. So I think one of my friends from Men's Health is here. I was a columnist for Men's Health for three years and for a column called Head Check, which was really fun for me, but I wrote some features for them as well, and one of them is called unforgettable where six women wrote about the best sex of their lives, and I got to do the psychoanalysis for it, so I mean, for me it was just like heaven. But I wouldn't have dated any of those women because they had low frontal lobes. And one of the quotes from the article is he wasn't my husband, that was the point. They need the drama, the excitement. That's why they race cars and jump out of perfectly good airplanes that could land, I just never got that part. And then, the other thing I learned and I learned this from Betty. So Betty was one of my first private practice patients who I just, I dearly loved her, I loved her family, but every session she would start with the most awful way she was going to kill herself, and I mean she just described it with such vivid horror. And, of course, if you care about your patient, much easier if you don't care. If you care, you're completely freaked out by this behavior, never knowing went to hospital or went to not, always contracting with her. And then one day I figured it out, and I looked at her and I said, "You need to stop that." She goes, "What do you mean?" I said, "You are no more going to kill yourself than I am." I said, "You have five children." And I'd already told her this, and I recommend you tell this to all your suicidal patients. You kill yourself, you've just given your child a 500% increase risk for killing themselves. I told you, I grew up Catholic, I'm good with guilt. You know it wasn't all bad and… But when people get depressed, they often, they lose their empathy for other people. And I said, "You're no more going to kill yourself than I am" because you love your children and you're not going to give them that risk. You use the negative thoughts as a way to stimulate yourself, and it was at that moment I had put together all the other pieces of her ADD life, and initially I saw her because I started seeing her kids for ADD. So positive thinking, there's no dopamine behind it. Some endorphins maybe, a little serotonin, there's no charge, and they're looking for the charge. And so, if I can figure out all the ways, I hate you or I've been hurt, or I've been a belittled. There's juice there. So you see these people at work, they're always focused on what's wrong rather than what's awesome and amazing, and also why they go to scary movies. Umm… Also from my journal, I used to be the kind of person who would walk in downtown Detroit at two in the morning. Now I would never do something so stupid. Before I just wouldn't think about conversations. Judgment improves when you treat it. When you treat their frontal lobes, focus, forethought, judgment, impulse, control, organization, planning, empathy, learning from the mistakes you make. It's like treatment is so important for these families. You miss it in a couple, you won't get them well. In fact, you may make them worse because what I've seen is they go and they try and it doesn't work, and then they go to somebody else and they try and it doesn't work, if we think of Bob and Betsy. Four times, no wonder they were demoralized. When they first said, "We like you but it doesn't help us." If I had to miss that, what would have happened to those babies, right? It's something you should scream every couple for because it's rampant in our society, it affects at least 30% of the couples you see. It will affect at least one member and 30% of the couples you see. So what are some of my rules for ADD and intimacy? Well, number one, you need to start meditating, and you need to do a specific one, I called loving, kindness, meditation. You're going to need a lot of forgiveness. And so you might as well start with a scientifically valid meditation that has been shown to decrease posttraumatic stress symptoms. Those of you that have lived in an ADD home, you have PTSD. Because of all the chaos and drama and it lives, it comes to live in your neurons. And so, I love this meditation, it's my favorite one and basically it's really simple. Come up with your own mantra. Mine is, you know, may you be happy, healthy and at peace and you start with yourself, may I be happy, healthy and at peace and do that for a few minutes, may I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be at peace because if you don't like yourself, you're not gonna like anybody else. And then you do it to someone you're thankful for, may tend to be happy, healthy and that piece. And then someone neutral, and then someone you're just angry with, and it's so powerful. That forgiveness is really powerful and you need to practice it if you're in the ADD family. The second one is get assessed and treated. Untreated ADD can ruin relationships and your health. And this is one of the few times in life I think it's perfectly fine for partners to organize the treatment. Now, you know, going lore in psychology or mental health treatment is you're not responsible for other people. Now, but you're responsible for yourself, and if he or she gets treated, your life will be so much better. So given that, you know, they'll come once and then they'll get distracted, and they'll go, the place doesn't care about me. Now, do it in a rational way, it's okay to help them with appointments. In fact, I want the families in my office, I don't want to just see the child or the adult with ADD. ADD is a family disorder, it affects everybody in the family, and I want to get to know them and I want them to get to know me as a resource for them. So obviously it starts with clinical histories and questionnaires. We develop questionnaires to help people know what type of ADD you have which you can talk to the folks at our booth about. And if treatment isn't working, you should get them scanned because how do you know unless you look. You know, as soon as I looked at Bob and Betsy scan, boom, I knew the path that we needed to go on, and it doesn't in any way diminish the need for psychotherapy, but wouldn't you rather do psychotherapy with a brain that works and can remember something and is not spinning out on the same thing that happened 12 years ago. Wouldn't you rather do that than do it with a brain that can't pay attention, that can't remember and so on. So, and you find out all sorts of things when we do imaging. You know, I'm a psychiatrist, why do I have to know about Lyme disease because it's a major cause of depression, it's a major cause of mental health issues. Why do I need to know about mold exposure because it's a major cause of ADD. It's a major cause of anxiety disorders, brain-fag, dementia. Why do I need to know about traumatic brain injury? You know, they didn't teach me anything about it in my residency because it's a major cause of homelessness, depression, suicide, addictions. And if you never look, you never know. And in the workshop today I went over those seven different types, I won't do that here, but if you want to learn more about it, my book Healing ADD has all of them. And then we target medicine or supplements to the type. One size doesn't fit everything. Stimulants can be a miracle or they can be a nightmare. You have to target the treatment individual brains, not just them. And then treating family dynamics really important from my journal. I'm not as intimidated by others like I used to be. So getting ADD treated disrupts the family dynamics. So I remember, I treated this very well-known author who… Umm… Before she had her awakening or epiphany, she was a nerd, she was an alcoholic, she was a rager, she had eating disorder, and one day she woke up on the floor of a halfway house, and realized that when she believed what was going on in her head, she suffered and when she didn't, she didn't suffer anymore. And I got introduced to her and her work which is really helpful to me personally, and then I started like, it always happens to me when I get to know people. I start scanning everybody in their family because it just applies to virtually everybody and, and then when I scanned her, she literally had the brain of a murderer, but her spiritual awakening got that under control. And when I treated her for the ADD she had, all of a sudden she starts fighting with her husband because she wanted to know, what are we doing with the finances, what are we doing with this decision, and I remember the husband in my office, he was not happy with me at all. And it took a while, right, for her to be better and for her to be okay with being better and they had to sort of redo their relationship because she wanted to be more involved. So it's tricky, you know, there are some tricky couples issues, it's not all balloons. my husband may not be as happy as before I was on medication. Now I can think and he doesn't win all of the arguments. I'm going to have to retrain him to not always expect to get his way. And I have to tell you one of the things I've told couples and my patients for decades now, is you train other people how to treat you. So if he's not being nice to you somehow along the way you made that okay and that's going to be a process, it's a training process to help him. Now, maybe he's got a head injury so I should see him and we could fix his head injury so he doesn't act like a jerk. Umm… This is really important, I don't want to fight when the medicine or the supplements have worn off. So you have to be aware of the timing of when the medicine or the supplements work. So for example, first thing in the morning, if there's a really important issue and they just took their medicine and it's not going to work for about half an hour. Please don't bring up your disappointment from the night before because all you're gonna do is you're going to trigger a fight. So you want to be thoughtful when is the best time to bring this up. Umm… And at night is the worse, and if because you can focus, you now have an orgasm and you tend to have sex at nine then medicine's worn off is carve out time during the day so that it can just be much more fun for you if it is helpful for you in that way. And I have to tell you, I get seriously irritated about the guys who, they are so excited about their ADD's diagnosis and the medicine really helps them and they take it for work and they don't take it on the weekends. And it's like, oh, great, you're gonna give your best attention to your job, and not your wife and your children. Is that smart? It's not smart. And people go, "But I worry about the long-term side effects of medicine." Okay, we have to talk about that issue because we don't know of any bad long-term side effects about medications that have been on the market since 1954, but whenever you ask about the side effects of medications, you always should ask the other question, which are, what are the side effects of not being on medication. What are the side effects of untreated ADD. Thirty three percent never finish high school. So I know a lot of you because you know as therapists, we tend to be deeply caring, often spiritual, and we want to do things naturally. And so often what I see therapists, their child's completely ADD and they don't want to put them on medicine because they have the controversy in society about medicine, and, but they never ask that the other side of the question which is, well, if I don't treat his or her ADD, what are the side effects of that, so their drug abuse. Fifty two percent according to one study from Harvard have problems with drug and alcohol abuse. It's a radically high incidence of smoking. There's a much higher incidence of teenage pregnancy, driving accidents, divorce, incarceration, bankruptcy, obesity, depression, head trauma, and now we even know dementia. So it just puts a different light on what are the side effects of the medication, and I'm always for, can we do the natural thing first, you know, omega-3 fatty acids especially EPA tend to be very helpful. Depending on your type, we have protocols for each supplement. But, but let's not dismiss the idea of full treatment because this is a disorder that can truly ruin someone's life. Okay. So you can tell I really like this picture. If my wife is here, she's like, oh, you really like that picture. To avoid boredom in the bedroom, novelty can be good. Otherwise they may pick a fight to get you stirred up. The problem is when you have someone like Betsy. So Betsy, when your cingulate gyrus works really hard, and in my workshop we'll talk more about this. When your cingulate gyrus works hard, you like things the same way, you get comfort. If we're going to have sex, it's going to be Tuesday and Saturday at about 8 o'clock and it's going to last for about a half an hour. And if you're married to someone who has ADD that just makes them crazy. Now, if you're married to somebody like you, Tuesday and Saturday at 8 o'clock. That's awesome. It's always, you know, I'm always talking to my patients, it's about fit. You know, do you fit with the person you're with, you know, if you both have a high libido, that's awesome. If you both have a low libido, that's awesome. If one is high and one is low, that's trouble, right? So it's about finding the best fit and it's okay to put novelty in your relationship if your partner needs that, so you may need to take a little extra serotonin to make that okay for you, but love is really not about just getting what you need, it's about getting what you need and finding out what your partner needs to as long as it's within your Catholic moral code.

DAN AMEN okay. Umm… I said this point, I make appointments, go to appointments, give feedback to the therapists and pharmacologists from the journal that amazes me the little yellow pill can take me from wanting to jump off a bridge to loving my husband and I joined my children. You saved my life, that was fun. My thoughts are calmer, quieter, easier to live with. I can't stand useless confrontation. When I used to thrive on it, classic, effectively treated ADD statement. It's like being given insight. So in my last few minutes, I'll tell you a very personal story. So when I met Tanna… Being married the first time was really hard, it was just really hard, and I'm persistent which is not necessarily a good thing as married for 20 years, and, and even with treatment and learning about adult, children of alcoholics and it just was never fun. And so when I got divorced, I mean, obviously the first thing I'm thinking about is if I ever get married again, I'm scanning her quickly. I mean, the rule in my house was if you dated one of my children and I thought you might stick around, I invited you to the clinic. My son-in-law actually wrote about it, and he wrote the teenage version of my book, Change Your Brain, Change Your Life. He wrote the book for teens and he opens it with the story of sitting in my office and he's 6'4" and I'm 5'6 and he goes, even though I'm nearly a foot taller than him I felt very small, and I'm sitting there with his scan and he's describing he has a heart cingulate, and I'm like, "You can be difficult, can't you?" No. 

00:50:45

00:50:50
DAN AMEN And that was just the rule in my family, and some of you will think that's awful. The New York Times Magazine did a story on me and they talked about that, and I got hate mail from people saying, I discriminated against people with mental illness. And I'm like, "No my son-in-law's mother has paranoid schizophrenia and his father killed himself, I wanted to know." And I love him, you know, like he's my own child, but I want to know and if it's not as good as it could be, I want you to be responsible enough to take care of it. And my first date with Tanna, I don't know about halfway through, she goes, "You think I have ADD, don't you?" Because in my book The Brain and love, Chapter 6, I wrote on how do you do with neuroscience interview on your first date? And I've actually planned it. 

00:51:45

00:51:50
DAN AMEN And she said, "Oh, I don't, I don't even believe in ADD." I think it's an excuse for bad behavior. 

00:51:55
[sil.] 

00:52:00
DAN AMEN But then she said, as, as I heard you talk, I realized my mother had it and my uncle had it, and I have to be eating something or I can't concentrate, and if I don't work out like crazy, I'm completely unhappy. And so two and half weeks later, when I decided I really liked her, I said, "You haven't seen the clinic yet." 

00:52:35
[sil.] 

00:52:40
DAN AMEN I scanned her and she had a gorgeous brain, little bit of ADD but the big deal was her mom. So her mom never finished high school, had run away from home. Had eight brain injuries and had been married five times with a lot of drama, a lot of chaos and Tanna's first memory was when Tanna is four years old and she remembers her mother falling to the floor screaming when she found out her brother had been murdered, and this kind of chaos followed Mary and Tanna and her brother was working with her, they were fighting non-stop, and, you know, whenever I fall in love with someone, I, you know, become everybody's doctor, I don't know why that is, but, so I scanned her and she has terrible ADD, and done a scan on her uncle, terrible ADD, and when I treat them both, they stop fighting with each other, it's unbelievable. And separately, they come to me, oh, you can't believe how much better Mary is. Oh, you can't believe how much better Robert is. And, so I've loved Mary for 12 years. When I first met her, the relationships were nothing but chaos. And now, her relationships are steady, they are consistent, they are loving. And is she different? See, people go, I'm not going to take medicine because I don't want to be somebody different. See, and I would argue you want to be who you really are when your brain works right, right, I mean, you never make that argument about glasses, you know, well, I don't wanna wear glasses because I want to be who I really am when I can't see. I'm like that's just the dumbest thing. 

00:54:40
[sil.] 

00:54:45
DAN AMEN ADD is real. It's not a fad. When it's left untreated, it devastates people's lives. But it doesn't have to, it's so much fun because since Tanna went, okay, I have ADD, and for me I know it, so I actually don't care if she shuts the doors, you know, the cabinet doors or she leaves wrappers out. I mean, I get it, and that's not why I married her to pick stuff up, right? So you want to know, if you love your ADD partner, what's okay, what's not okay. And since we've been married, she's finished eight books because she can focus, that's what I want for you. Thank you so much.
