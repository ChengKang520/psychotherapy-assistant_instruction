DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Hello! I'm Dr. Jennifer Baggerly. Before this annual hurricane season, I get lots of practice providing disaster mental health for children. I also provided intervention for children in Sri Lanka after the tsunami in 2005 and in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. Today, I'll share with you many evidence and formed interventions that you can use with children who experienced disasters and crisis, such as school shootings, death of a family member or any unusual event that overwhelms their ability to cope. Children are one of the most vulnerable populations during a disaster or other crisis. Simply, their neurophysiological cognitive abilities and coping strategies are not developed enough to handle an overwhelming, life threatening event. Too few mental health and medical professionals are trained to respond specifically to children after a disaster or crisis. Yet you will be much better prepared to mitigate the devastating impact of disaster on children after viewing this program. You will learn the "big 5" impact of disaster in crisis on children, guiding principles for responding to children, basic grounding and containment skills, initial individual interventions, and group interventions. Impact of disaster and crises on children. Understanding the impact of disaster and crises on children is important for three reasons: First, it will provide purposeful direction so your interventions will not be haphazard; second, you will need to explain the impact of disaster on children to parents and teachers so they'll have developmentally appropriate expectations; finally, you will need to explain the impact of a disaster to children so they won't be confused and worried about their symptoms. One way to conceptualize information about the impact of disaster on children is to organize responses or symptoms into the "Big 5." In adult language, the five categories for symptoms are physiological, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and spiritual. Physiological: Here's a simple explanation of the neurophysiological impact of a disaster on a child. Usually, ordinary memories are stored in the left side of our brain. During a traumatic event, the brain turns on the fight or flight response. Hormones become higher to keep us alert to fight or flight or freeze. The parts of the brain that are responsible for speech and comprehension, Broca's and Wernicke's Area, shut down. Vivid images or pictures and feelings of the traumatic event get stuck on the right side of the brain. They keep coming up intruding, trying to go to the left side of the brain where they are usually stored. However, the images are so scary that the person tries to get rid of them by being overly active, such as being hyper-vigilant or aggressive or by avoiding them such as seen in substance abuse or disassociation. It's important to learn new ways to decrease anxiety and process these memories by talking or playing them out so they can be stored in the left side of the brain. Then the child will have more energy to think clearly, feel better and get along with others. A more detailed explanation is given in the handout. Let's stop and practice in explaining this physiological response to an adult. I'll demonstrate how to explain this to a child now. 

00:04:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, let, I'm gonna tell you what happens to your brain during something scary like a hurricane or a tornado or something like that. So I'm gonna tell you what happens to your brain. So let's pretend this is your brain. Now, usually, when something happy happens like, uhm, you have a happy memory or something, your, the memory of what happens goes up to the top of your brain and gets put there, right there, nice and neat on the left side of your brain, right up there, nice and neat. So you can, kind of, see a picture of it. So, something happy like your last birthday party. So let's pretend this is a picture of your last birthday party. Tell me what happened at your last birthday party. So what happened at your last birthday party, Rabiah? 

00:05:00
RABIAH Well, my last birthday party, I had a Barbie cake- (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Wow. 

00:05:10
RABIAH - and everybody got ice cream in school. (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  So you had a Barbie cake and everybody got ice cream. So that's a nice happy memory. It goes up here at the top of your brain like that. But sometimes, when something scary happens, like a hurricane or a tornado, the memory goes down to the bottom of your brain like this because it doesn't have time to go up to the ah, top part of your brain 'coz you're trying to keep yourself safe. So the memories go down here, and then they start rattling around like that. And these memories of the, in the, kinda of the pictures that you see of the hurricane or the tornado, they're down here rattling around and it makes it hard for you to read at school or maybe uhm, you get distracted or maybe you're trying to play with your friends but you keep hearing that so you're getting fights. So it goes down to the bottom part of your brain. But, you know what we can do to make the memories go from the bottom part? What? 

00:06:10
RABIAH We can try to think about other stuff that makes you happy. 

00:06:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Bright. You think about other stuff that makes you happy and you can talk and play about what happens so that these thoughts go right up here at the top and they're not rattling around anymore. So you can play about what happened or talk about what happened with somebody that cares about you, and they can help you so that it doesn't bother you anymore. 

00:06:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Cognitive. From what we learned about neurophysiology, we can see that disasters and crises impact children in the cognitive area. Children who experience traumatic events may have difficulty concentrating or making decisions. They may have memory problems, intrusive thoughts and images, difficulty establishing safety and trust, and skewed perceptions of morality. Emotional. The impact of disasters on children's emotions may include moodiness and inability to manage feelings, ongoing sadness or depression, intense anger, self-blame and guilt, embarrassment of not having basic needs met, inability to maintain intimacy and connections with others, and lower self-esteem. Behavioral. Behavioral changes, as a result of a disaster or crisis, may include loss of interest in school and play, social withdrawal, hyper-vigilance, hyperactivity, aggressiveness in fighting, regressive behaviors, such as, bed-wetting and thumb sucking, alcohol and drug abuse, poor hygiene, and sexual acting out. Spiritual. Spirituality is often overlooked but can be impacted by disasters. Doubts about God or religious beliefs occur, loss of spiritual identity, apathy in religious practices or rituals, shattered world views, such as seeing everyone and everything is bad. Stop and identify one response in each of the "Big 5" categories that you observed in yourself or a child during a recent crisis. How can we explain the "Big 5" impact of disaster to children? We need to use words, actions and songs that children already know. In children's language, the "Big 5" will be simplified to: one, brain; two, body; three, heart; four, hands; and five, knees. Brain will represent the neurophysiological and cognitive; body represents the physical; heart represents the emotional; hands represent the behavioral; and knees represent the spiritual. I chose these words to explain the "Big 5" to children so we can put it to a familiar children song of "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes." We'll just use the same tune but change the words and actions as follows: 

00:09:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Now, we're going to learn five changes that sometimes happen in kids when something scary happens. And the five changes happen in your brain with the way you think; in your body with the way your stomach feels or your head feels; with your heart, sometimes kids gets ah, worried or sad; with your hands, the things that you do; and then with your knees, spiritual things like praying or singing. And so, our song goes like this: "Brain, body, heart, hands and knees, hands and knees. Brain, body heart, hands and knees, hands and knees. I can calm down. This is key. Brain, body, heart, hands and knees, hands and knees." You got it. 

00:10:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY We can give a simple explanation using the handout available with this DVD. The most important part in explaining the "Big 5" is to emphasize that these responses are normal. In other words, they happen a lot to a lot of people and they're usually temporary and only last a short time. I'll demonstrate this with a child. 

00:10:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY So, now, let me show you, uhm, I'll show you and your mom a paper right here so your mom can help you know some of the changes that happen to many kids after something scary. In your brain, sometimes kids can't think and they kinda get confused. In your body, sometimes kids have headaches or stomach aches. In your heart, sometimes kids feel sad or mad. And the things that you do, sometimes kids fight or they just play by themselves. And in your knees, ah, this has to do with spiritual things like sometimes people think that, uhm, God is mad at them. But on this part of the paper, your mom can help you see that there are lots of things we can do to calm ourselves down. In our brain, what we can do is we can think about happy thoughts and ask questions if we're confused. In our body, we can run and jump and, ah, sometimes relax our body by breathing deep? In our heart, the way that you feel, you can know that it's okay to cry if you need to or you can laugh if you want to. In the things that you do, you can ask for help or you can, uhm, go outside and play and you can sing. And in the, with your knees, with the spiritual things, you can pray or sing, what, whatever your family usually does. So this is, these are things that can help you calm down and your mom will help you remember some of those things. Okay. 

00:12:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY There are several guiding principles for responding to children. The first principle in disaster response is to submit to the Incident Command Structure. This is a paramilitary structure that brings order to chaos by identifying team leaders who follow pre-determined procedures. You must check in with the incident commander or designee on scene before providing the interventions. Do not go to an incident unless you're deployed by an identified person in identified organization to a specific place at a specific time. The second principle is to follow the Six C's of disaster mental health as identified by the World Health Organization. These six C's are calmness, common sense, compassion, collaboration, communication, and control of yourself. They're described in your handout. Third, we need to maintain hardiness and flexibility. You will need to be physically and emotionally hardy, healthy and strong to endure long hours in uncomfortable settings. Flexibility is essential to working in a constantly changing situation with diverse people. The fourth principle is having an expectation that children and their families will have a normal recovery. Rather than seeing all symptoms as pathological, hold the view that most child, children are simply having normal responses to an abnormal experience. Fifth, a safe place is essential in order for stabilization and trauma recovery to occur. You may need to help create a safe space for children by moving chairs to be a boundary for a children's area or informing the incident commander of unsafe people in the area. The sixth principle is to utilize developmentally appropriate approaches with children. Children are not miniature adults. We need to engage children with their natural language of play by using toys, puppets, art materials, and storybooks. The last principle is that crisis situations require more directive approaches so children have a sense of order and safety. In the early phases of a disaster, the goal is to stabilize. Stabilization requires directives in order to teach children coping skills and to keep them safe. Stop and discuss which guiding principle will be most difficult for you. Develop a plan to improve in this area. Basic grounding and containment skills. Stabilization on children during a disaster or crisis can be accomplished by implementing grounding and containment skills. These basic skills are derived from evident space practice of cognitive behavioral therapy. Teaching children these will help them increase their sense of safety by stabilizing their body, cognitions, behavior, emotions, and social relationships. Controlled breathing to decrease hyper-arousal and avoidance is needed. The purpose of teaching children slow, deep breathing is to lower their heart rate, decrease hyper-arousal and anxiety, and help them feel more relaxed. Teach children to breathe slowly and deeply from their diaphragms rather than from their chest. 

00:15:55
Controlled Breathing Using "Butterfly Breathing" 

00:15:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY I'm gonna teach you something you can do with your body to help your body relax. Some, it's really important to breathe deeply. Breathe in. Breathe out slowly. But I'm gonna show you how you can do this real easy. Put your hands behind your head like this. And breathe. Breathe out slow. And then if you move your arms like this, it's like you're a butterfly. So this is called "Butterfly Breathing." So we breathe in slow, and we blow out slow. So that's "Butterfly Breathing". 

00:16:40
Controlled Breathing By Blowing Soap Bubbles 

00:16:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  We can have bubbles and when you blow these bubbles, you have to breathe real slowly. So, here you go. Try, try blowing a bubble here. You did it. All right. Now, you blow one. All right. You did it. Yeah. You can pop 'em. Here's a, here's another thing we're gonna do. 

00:17:05
 Blow, blow that. 

00:17:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  This is a pinwheel. Hold the pinwheel and blow that. There you go. 

00:17:15
Controlled Breathing Using Cup On Stomach 

00:17:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY So take a deep breath. And fill up your, you belly, your stomach with air. And then when you blow out, there you go. 

00:17:25
 Like this? 

00:17:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. Yeah. Blow and then when you blow out, the cup will go down. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  All right. You're learning to relax. You're learning to breathe deeply and relax. 

00:17:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Body relaxation to decrease hyper-arousal and avoidance. Body relaxation will also help children decrease hyper-arousal and anxiety and increase their sense of self-control. A quick fun way to relax a body is the "Butterfly Hug", developed by Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapist. 

00:18:10
Body Relaxation Using "The Butterfly Hug" 

00:18:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY The "Butterfly Hug". So go like this. 

00:18:15
 Like this? 

00:18:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. Like this, and you're gonna go, one, two, like that. So this is a "Butterfly Hug". And so, what you do is, see, here's your butterfly. Your butterfly's flying and now it crosses your arms like this, lands on your shoulder, and goes pat, pat, pat. 

00:18:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Progressive muscle tension and relaxation is also important for children. Tell them that we're going to learn to tense like a Tinman and relax like a ragdoll. Start from the top of your head and go down to your toes. 

00:18:50
Body Relaxation Using "Tense Like A Tinman Relax Like A Ragdoll" 

00:18:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Well, what we're gonna do is, uhm, we're gonna tense our arms like this. Tense 'em like a Tinman. Now, relax like a ragdoll. Now, now, tense your arms like this again. Tense like a Tinman. Now relax like a ragdoll. 

00:19:15
 Oops. 

00:19:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Now. It's okay. Now, tense your, your rear, here. Tense like a Tinman, all stiff and straight. Now, relax like a ragdoll. 

00:19:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Controlling thoughts to manage intrusive re-experiencing. Teaching children to control their thoughts will help children recover when they have intrusive memories. Remember, the goal during disaster and crisis response is stabilization. If a child goes to counseling at a later date, then the therapist will help a child process memories in a different way. However, for disaster response, our goal is stabilization. 

00:19:55
Controlling Intrusive Thoughts By "Picturing Stop Sign And Saying Stop" 

00:19:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  We're gonna make a stop sign. And sometimes, when you, ah, have thoughts that you don't like, like, sometimes kids will think about or remember something scary, so what you can do is make a stop sign and say, "Stop!" And now, tell me about your scary thought. 

00:20:15
 Well, my scary feeling was about whenever I was walking around a trail and then there was a pond next to me. 

00:20:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
 And it had alligators in it and I accidentally put my foot in there, and then I, I fell inside there. 

00:20:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Oh, so you fell in the pond with the alligators. That's scary. So, when you have that thought, think of this stop sign and say, "stop!" Okay. Say, "stop!" 

00:20:40
  Stop! 

00:20:45
Controlling Intrusive Thoughts by "Changing the tape/CD" 

00:20:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY You know, sometimes when there's a music CD in and you don't like the song, all you have to do is take it out and put in a new CD. And so that sometimes what happens with our thoughts. If you have a thought you don't like, like, maybe you're thinking about the scary alligator, you're gonna take that CD out and put in a new CD. So, we're, we're gonna replace that thought with something that you like. So tell me a happy thought that you have. 

00:21:15
 Well, that I went to my godmother's house and we had a lot of fun because we were playing Xbox. 

00:21:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Being at your godmother's house playing Xbox with your friends. So, when you have that scary thought about the alligator, I want you to take that out and put in the CD, the new thought of being at your godmother's, playing Xbox. Okay? So, go. I'm at my godmother's, playing Xbox. 

00:21:45
  I'm at my godmother's, playing Xbox. 

00:21:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. 

00:21:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Singing positive songs is a fun way to increase positive thoughts. Try changing the words to a familiar children's song. For example, the Association for Play Therapy members working in Sri Lanka made up this song to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." "I am safe and I am strong. Take a breath and sing the song. I'm growing stronger every day. I know that I'll be okay. I'm safe and I am strong. Take a breath and sing along." 

00:22:25
Controlling Intrusive Thoughts by "Singing Positive Songs" 

00:22:25
 "I am safe and I am strong. Take a breath and sing this song. I'm growing stronger every day. I know that I'll be okay. I am safe and I am strong. Take a breath and sing this song." Okay. You did it. 

00:22:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Visualizing a safe happy place is another important step in teaching children to control their thoughts. 

00:22:55
Controlling Intrusive Thoughts by "Visualizing a Safe Happy Place" 

00:22:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Okay. Now, we're going to think about a safe place. So your godmother's home is also a safe place. So, what I want you to do is I want you to think about your godmother's home. Think about your godmother's home and a safe place and you think about your home. And just picture it and think about what are the colors that you see there at your godmother's home, and think about what sounds do you hear there, and just calm your body down and relax while you think about that safe place. 

00:23:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY The 3-2-1 game is another method of bringing children's attention into the here now instead of the fear of the past or the worry of future. 

00:23:45
Controlling Intrusive Thoughts by "The 3-2-1 Game" 

00:23:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And Shep and Sugarloaf like to play a game called, "The 3-2-1 Game." Are you ready to play the 3-2-1 Game? 

00:23:55
 Yes. 

00:23:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Here's a 3-2-1 Game. Tell me three things you can see above your head. 

00:24:00
 Ah. 

00:24:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes? 

00:24:00
 Lights. 

00:24:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Okay. Tell me something else you can see above your head. 

00:24:05
RABIAH The boxes. 

00:24:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY The box. And what else do you see above your head? 

00:24:10
 Oh, maybe, ah, the, the thing that is right there you see those little lines? 

00:24:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. I'll bet. A handlebar. Okay. Now, tell me three things that you can hear. 

00:24:25
 Somebody talking. 

00:24:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Someone talking. And what can you hear? 

00:24:30
 I think that, the light's going uhmm. 

00:24:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. You can hear those lights. Now, tell me three things that you can touch. What else? What can you touch? 

00:24:40
 I can touch the fur on your doll. 

00:24:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. What can you touch? 

00:24:40
RABIAH  Uhm. 

00:24:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Your sk, your skin. 

00:24:45
RABIAH My skin. 

00:24:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And what can you touch? 

00:24:50
 I can touch, uhm, my sandals. 

00:24:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, your sandals. Okay. Now, tell me two things you see above your eyes. Uh-huh. 

00:25:00
 A light and an air conditioner. 

00:25:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Okay. Now, tell me two things you can hear. 

00:25:05
 Ah. 

00:25:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh-huh? 

00:25:05
  I can hear, uhm, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Woof, woof. 

00:25:20
 - a dog. 

00:25:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh hmm. Okay? 

00:25:20
RABIAH I can hear somebody talking and I hear the, that the lights are making it too. 

00:25:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh hmm. The buzz. Now, tell me two things you can touch. Uh-huh? 

00:25:30
 You can touch your hair and your clothes. 

00:25:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay? And what else can you touch? 

00:25:35
 You can touch, uhm, you can touch your feet if, if you're wearing sandals very(ph) close. 

00:25:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. Now, tell me one thing you can see above your eyes. Uh-huh? 

00:25:50
 Numbers. 

00:25:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Numbers. Okay. Tell me one thing else you can hear. woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof. Uh-huh? 

00:26:00
 This dog. 

00:26:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. And one thing you can touch. 

00:26:05
 Uhm, I can touch the wall? 

00:26:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. All right. Good. That was a 3-2-1 Game. 

00:26:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Containment to manage intrusive re-experiencing. Containment skills provide further methods for managing intrusive re-experiencing. Many children will spontaneously draw a scary picture of the event. Help them contain this image by doing the following: 

00:26:30
Containing Intrusive Re-experiencing by "Placing Picture in Envelope" 

00:26:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  When I came, you were drawing a picture of the tornado, and you were drawing a picture. 

00:26:40
 Of tornado. 

00:26:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Okay. Sometimes, when you keep looking at the pictures of the tornado, some kids start to feel a little scared. So what we're gonna do is, ah, fold them up and put them in this envelope. So, I'm gonna give you each an envelope and fold them up, and put them in this envelope and then we're gonna seal the envelope. Where would you like to put your envelope? 

00:27:05
RABIAH Maybe in the corner over there. 

00:27:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. All right. 

00:27:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Making a Play-Doh worry object to keep or take away worries is another fun activity. 

00:27:15
Containing Intrusive Re-experiencing By "making A Play-doh Worry Object" 

00:27:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Okay. Now, we have some Play-Doh and what we're gonna do is make a Play-Doh worry object, a worry object to something that you make that you can put your worries on and take it away, like, sometimes people will make a dolphin and put all their worries on the dolphin and let this dolphin swim away. Or sometimes people will make a ball and then they put their worries on the ball, things are worried about like that the hurricane is gonna come back or that they're, ah, not gonna be able to see their friends soon, and they put their worries on it and then they just send the ball away. Kick the ball away. Or sometimes, people will make an airplane and put the worries on their airplane and then it goes away. So take a few minutes and make something that you can put your worries on. 

00:28:10
 Uhm, I made a kind of like an Easter egg,- 

00:28:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh. 

00:28:15
 - but except, it has nothing on it but it's just blue because this is blue. 

00:28:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. So you made an Easter egg to put your worries on. And you made a? 

00:28:25
RABIAH Chocolate kisses. 

00:28:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You made chocolate kisses to put your worries on. And you made a flower to put your worries on. 

00:28:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Body Burrito is a way to physically contain feelings. It's based on the old practice of swaddling a child. Occupational therapist often use this for sensory integration. 

00:28:45
Containing Intrusive Re-experiencing by "Body Burrito" 

00:28:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Now, we're gonna do a Body Burrito. That's where you get to be a Burrito in this blanket. 

00:28:55
 (Laughing) 

00:28:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY So, why don't you stand up. 

00:29:00
 I got to check I'm Burrito. 

00:29:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And we're gonna put this blanket around you. And then what you can do is you're gonna wrap up in it like this. Now, you're a Burrito. Now, it's kinda get down, back down on the floor and you can sit down and lay down and then see if you can roll in it. Roll over here. 

00:29:15
  (Laughing). I'm Burrito. 

00:29:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY There you are. Okay. Roll that way. Okay. 

00:29:25
 (Laughing). 

00:29:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY There you are. Now, just, just lay there and try and relax. Hah, try and relax in your Body Burrito. 

00:29:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Initial Individual Interventions. The Child C³ARE Model is an initial individual intervention. It has six steps: check, connect, comfort, assess, refer, and educate. 

00:29:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hi. My name is Jennifer. This is my puppet, Sugarloaf and Shep. Is it okay if I visit with you? It's okay with you, Mom? 

00:30:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. This is Sugarloaf. Would you like to pat him? This is Shep. Would you like to pat him here? We're just here helpin' out today in the hurricane shelter. What's your name? 

00:30:15
NOAH Noah. 

00:30:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hi, Noah. And you're here with your mom? Yeah. Do you have, uhm, other family here with you? You do? Okay. Uhm, and does your, does the rest of your family and your friends, do they know where you are? Do you, do you need to let them know where you are? 

00:30:35
 They know where we are. 

00:30:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Good. Good. All right. Well, I'm just checking with folks to see if they're doing okay and see how they're feeling. Uhm, is, does anything hurt on you, Noah? No. You've, okay. Are you feeling okay? Are you, are you thirsty? No? Well, I have some water here for you if you get some, get thirsty. Would you like some water? No. Let's see if your mom might like some water. Would you like some water, Mom? 

00:31:00
 Sure, I'd like some water. Thank you. 

00:31:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Okay, 'coz Noah might get thirsty later. And you know what? We even have some snacks, too. Let's see. Is this a pack of snacks that your mom lets you have sometimes? All right. I'll leave some snacks there for you just in case you need it. And, I know that Sugarloaf, he sometimes gets scared because he's staying here in the shelter. "Yeah. I'm kinda scared because that storm is going on outside." But Shep, he's a wise-old sheepdog, and he says, "Sugarloaf, I know you're scared, but we know some ways to calm down." Do you, would you like to learn some ways to calm down in case you start to feel scared or worried? Okay. " I know, you can put your hands behind your head and take a deep breath." So, how about if you go like this. Practice putting your hands behind your head like that, and you can take a deep breath and it calms you down. Yeah. I hear you're talking deep breath. So it looks like that helps you. And I know another thing, too. Sometimes, kids like blowing bubbles and I have some bubbles right here. Have you ever blown bubbles before? Yeah? Okay. Why don't I get you this and we'll see if, if you would like to, well, try blowing a bubble there. All right. Yeah. That one you blew real fast. And sometimes, it works a little bit better if you blow slow. There, you did it. Look at that. 

00:32:40
NOAH (Laughing) 

00:32:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. So, I'm gonna leave these bubbles with you so you can play with them, and if you start to feel upset, you can blow bubbles and that can help you calm down. And I know another thing that helps kids calm down, too. It's called "tense like a Tinman and relax like a ragdoll." Have you ever heard of that Wizard Of Oz show? No? There's, on the Wizard of Oz, there's this Tinman that's really stiff like this. So stiff up your arms like this, go real, yeah. I see your muscles. Now relax like a rag doll. Yeah, sometimes that helps your muscles relax. And so, that's something your mom can also help you do. And you know, I know that Sugarloaf, sometimes she worries." I'm worried that maybe that storm started because I had a bad dream." "No, Sugarloaf, the storm didn't start because you had a bad dream. It started because," why do you think the storm started? 

00:33:50
[sil.] 

00:33:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, Shep's gonna tell you. It started because as, ah, wind started going over the warm water and the system of wind started the hurricane. So it, it started and the weatherman told us that the hurricane is gonna be passing in about a day. So we know that, almost ah, Sugarloaf, didn't start it or anything. Yeah. I know something else to help kids calm down. It's the 3-2-1 game. Would you like to play the 3-2-1 game? Okay, this is how we'll do it and your mom can help you too. We'll look for three things above our eye levels. So tell me three things you can see above your head? 

00:34:40
NOAH  Uhm. Numbers. 

00:34:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Numbers, yeah. Okay, and mom, what else do you see above your head? 

00:35:00
 I see lights. 

00:35:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, lights, and one other thing, what else do you all see? 

00:35:05
NOAH I see, uhm, walls. 

00:35:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Walls, yes. Okay, so you saw the numbers and the lights and the walls. Now, tell me three things you can hear. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Did you hear that? 

00:35:25
NOAH  The dog. 

00:35:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY The dog. 

00:35:30
 Shep. 

00:35:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Shep. How about, arf, arf, arf, arf. 

00:35:35
NOAH That was Sugarloaf. 

00:35:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY That's Sugarloaf, yeah. 

00:35:40
 (Laughing) 

00:35:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And I bet you heard your mom laughing there too, yeah. Now, tell me three things you can touch. Three things you can touch. 

00:35:50
NOAH My mommy. 

00:35:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Your mommy, and what else? 

00:35:55
NOAH  Here(ph). 

00:36:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Sugarloaf. And how about this. 

00:36:00
NOAH Shep. 

00:36:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  And Shep, yeah. And so, that's how you play the 3-2-1 game then you look for two other things above your head, and two other things that you can hear and two other things that you can touch, and then one other thing above your head, and one other thing that you hear, and then one other thing you can touch. So you and your mom can play that game, two if you would like. And it helps us, calm down and it helps us just think about the safe place that we are in right now. Yeah. And you know, sometimes kids get worried about being here ah, and I was wondering, uhm, how, how you're feeling? Are you worried or not worried. Are you this much worried or this much worried or this much worried? 

00:36:50
NOAH  Hmm. This much worried. 

00:36:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY That much worried? Yeah, lot of kids feel that much worried when they're here. And I'm gonna show you and your mom this paper, and this shows typical things that happen to typical kids. So lots of kids have different changes that they notice in their brain. And they're, like they get confused, and they notice changes in their body, like maybe they feel dizzy or that they have a stomach ache. Sometimes kids notice changes in their feelings, that like they feel worried or the things they do, like they might start fighting or just sitting alone, or even, with spiritual things, uhm, like what they, they think that maybe God is mad at them. So those are five areas that a lot of kids notice changes. And your mom can help you notice on that. And then, but these are five things we can do, like on this you can ask for help or you can ask questions. So, do you have any questions you would like to ask right now? No. Okay, if you think of some questions, you can ask your mom, or, or me or, maybe that police officer over there, too. He can help you. And in your body, you can feel better by drinking water, like the water I gave your mom, or running and jumping and playing. And with your ah, feelings, it's okay to cry if you need to. It's okay to even laugh. And with your hands, that's the things that you do. You can relax like I showed you. And you can uhm, read a book or play with toys, and then with, here with the spiritual things, you can ah, pray or sing. Is that something that your family sometimes does? Yeah. So those are things that, uhm, you and your mom can work on and if you start to notice changes, then you can help remind him about things like that. 

00:38:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And I also have uhm, a handout for parents, and it has some referral information on the back of where to get help from different agencies- (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
 Great. 

00:39:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY - uhm, like some of the ah, organizations, relief organizations and government agencies, as well as, some information on kids. Yeah. 

00:39:15
 Okay. 

00:39:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY So, it looks like you want to get back to your, your coloring there. Now, I see that you drew something here. Tell me about your picture? 

00:39:25
NOAH Hmm, that's the rain, and that's a tree, that's rain, that's thunder and that's thunder. 

00:39:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh yeah. 

00:39:35
NOAH And that's lightning. 

00:39:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, so sometimes that looks like it can kind of be a scary picture, and I know sometimes what can help kids, is if you fold up your picture. Would you like to fold up your picture and put it in a safe place? Okay, so you can fold your picture. Can I fold your picture? Yeah, like that and then you can put it in a safe place. Where's the safe place you can put 'em, like maybe with your mom, or in your pocket or something? 

00:40:05
NOAH I have an easel. 

00:40:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Or you have an easel you could put it in. Okay, yes, so your mom could keep it for you to put it on the easel. And another thing that helps kids, is if they draw a picture of a happy safe place. So if you would like to, you could draw a picture of a happy, safe place, and that way you could remember about those happy safe places, okay. 

00:40:25
 Okay. 

00:40:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right. Well, I'm gonna go visit some other kids, now, but in about an hour, we're gonna have some group games with some other kids, and so, do you think you might like to play some games with some other kids a little later? Yeah, okay, then I'll come back and get you, and then I'll introduce you to some other kids, so we can play some games and play with some toys. Thanks for visiting with me. 

00:40:50
 Thank you. Goodbye. 

00:40:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Bye Noah, bye Noah. 

00:40:50
 Bye. 

00:40:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  See yah. 

00:40:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Group interventions. Forming groups is an efficient way to provide psychoeducation for lots of children who experience disaster or crisis. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network and UCLA researchers have identified the goals for psychoeducation, as follows: Normalize symptoms, manage hyper-arousal, manage intrusive re-experiencing, increase accurate cognitions, increase effective coping, facilitates social support and foster hope. These goals can be accomplished in groups. By many of the ground and in containment activities that I've demonstrated before and by reading story books, such as "A Terrible Thing Happened," "Brave Bart," and "Don't Pop Your Cork On Monday." I'll describe and demonstrate several other group interventions. Puppet shows can be used to address common cognitive distortions held by children after a disaster. For example, after the tsunami, many Sri Lankan children believed that the tsunami happened because God was mad at them. Puppet shows can also inform children about normal symptoms and coping strategies. 

00:42:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, now it's time for the puppet show. 

00:42:15
 Yehey. 

00:42:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY "Hi, my name is Shep and I'm a wise old sheepdog. Hi, my name is Sugarloaf, and I'm kinda scared. I'm just a little puppy. Well, Sugarloaf, what are you kinda of scared about?" Lets ask you guys, what do you think Sugarloaf might be scared of, since he's here at the hurricane shelter? Yes? 

00:42:35
  A hurricane might come? 

00:42:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. "Yeah, I'm kinda of scared that a hurricane might come." Well, Sugarloaf, that is very common for kids to be scared of the hurricane. Sometimes kids will notice different things in their body and their thoughts, and the things that they do, and the things that they feel during a hurricane. Let me ask these kids. Have you guys noticed anything different in your body or the way you feel since being at the hurricane shelter? Yes? 

00:43:10
 That uhm, uhm, like I'm kinda nervous, when I first came, like right out there, you are over there and I was kinda shy because I didn't even know you. 

00:43:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Yeah, because there are a lot of new people here at the hurricane shelter. And so you are kind of nervous, being with a lot of new people. So sometimes kids will feel nervous and sometimes kids might notice that they get a stomach ache, or maybe they get a headache, and some kids run around and some kids get really scared and just sit by themselves. Yes? 

00:43:55
 I had a headache before, three times. 

00:43:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Three times, so you've already had it. "What can we do when we feel like that?" Well, it's very important to relax and calm yourself down. "But, sometimes I'm afraid it might happen again because I think I had a bad thought, and that's what caused the hurricane." "Oh, Sugarloaf, bad thoughts don't cause a hurricane. Hurricanes get caused by the cold air going over the warm water. Let me ask these kids. Kids, do you think Sugarloaf caused a hurricane." No. 

00:44:40
 No. 

00:44:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY No. But you can calm yourself down. Let me ask these kids. Kids, what do you know to help yourself calm down? Yes? 

00:44:50
 Uhm, you just have to breathe in, and then very slowly, breathe out, or if you, if you have cups, you could put them on your belly and then lay on the, on, on your bed. 

00:45:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh-huh. 

00:45:05
 And then you could, like, see if uhm, everything is, everything is fine. 

00:45:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh-huh. So you know how to do deep breathing. Okay, and what else do you know to calm yourself down? 

00:45:20
 You can do like this. And then like this. 

00:45:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, the butterfly breathing. 

00:45:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Yeah, and Sugarloaf, you can also play with your friends, that's really important. And there are other things you can do. Some families will pray or sing, and sometimes kids find it's helpful to write things down, or to draw pictures of safe happy places. "Yeah, I think all that is gonna help me feel better." So kids, do you know it's important to help each other feel better? 

00:45:55
 Yes. 

00:45:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes, it is important to help each other feel better. So now, lets go have some games and help each other feel better. Yey. 

00:46:00
  Yey. 

00:46:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Delightful Detective is a game where children look for evidence that people are safe now and that they'll be okay after the disaster. Children can interview people and collect evidence, or point to evidence. 

00:46:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Lets play Delightful Detective. 

00:46:20
 What's that? 

00:46:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  And with the Delightful Detective, you know what a detective does? 

00:46:25
  Ah. 

00:46:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY What? 

00:46:30
 Figure out crime. 

00:46:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes, that's exactly what we're gonna do. It's, we're gonna figure out clues. So this is what I want you to do. Let's figure out clues that we know that we're safe. So tell me one clue you know that we're safe right now. 

00:46:45
 If a hurricane come. We can come here and if, if it comes here, we can go somewhere else that's safe. 

00:46:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, so how would you know it's a safe place to be? 

00:47:00
 Because, because, this is a hurricane center. 

00:47:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, it's a hurricane center. And see these walls that are nice and strong? And see that ceiling? Those are our clues that it's a safe place, and plus remember the people who run this place are ah, from the Red Cross and there's some police here, and we know that it's gonna be a safe place for us. 

00:47:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Garbage or Treasure. For this game you'll make cards with wasteful and valuable thoughts and actions, as well as, true and untrue reasons that the disaster happens. Have the children sort through them as Garbage or Treasure. 

00:47:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right now, we're gonna play, Garbage or Treasure. And this is where garbages stuff that's not true. Treasures stuff that's true. So I'm gonna read you something and you tell me, is it Garbage or is it Treasure. And here's the first one. The hurricane was my fault. Is that Garbage or Treasure? Yes? 

00:48:05
 Garbage. 

00:48:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, that's Garbage. Now here's another one. The hurricane was caused by cold winds over warm water. Yes? 

00:48:15
  Treasure. 

00:48:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, treasure. Okay. And here's another one. If I just stay all alone and don't play with anybody, I'll feel better. You think that's Garbage or Treasure? Yes? 

00:48:30
  Garbage. 

00:48:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Garbage. Here's another one. I can play with and talk with others to feel better. Yes? 

00:48:40
  Treasure. 

00:48:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Treasure, okay. 

00:48:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Radio Talk Show. Appoint children to be experts on a radio talk show. Pretend to call in with common questions children may have about the disaster, symptoms and coping. And ask the experts, the children, to give answers to these questions. 

00:49:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Now, lets play a Radio Talk Show. This is how it goes. It's that radio talk show is where we have a microphone and we're gonna pretend we're on the radio and people are gonna call up, and they want to talk to experts like you, who have been in a hurricane shelter and know how to calm themselves down. So you get to hold this microphone. Here comes the first call, "Hello, I would like to know what caused the hurricane?" 

00:49:35
 Cold air and warm water. 

00:49:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, now pass that microphone to the next expert. "Hello, uhm, I'm really, really, really, really scared. Do you know anything I can do calm down?" 

00:49:50
 Well, you can put your hands in the back of your head, and breathe in slowly and breathe out slowly. 

00:50:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Now pass it to next expert. "Hello, ah, I'm wondering if I'll ever, ever be able to go back to my house. I just don't know what's gonna happen? What should I do? 

00:50:15
 Well, if, if you just want, uhm, to be safe, because of the, uhm, tornado or hurricane, you could just, uhm, go in your friend's house or maybe in Ohio because, uhm, there's, it has no hurricane there. 

00:50:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. 

00:50:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Shield of Faith or Heart Blanket. Draw a cross or x on a sheet of paper or a white paper plate. Ask children to iden, identify four coping strategies that they can use to feel better. And draw this into each sections. Make two holes at the top and thread a string through it. Put it around the child's neck, so it hangs over the heart. 

00:51:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY We're going to make a Shield of Faith or a Heart Blanket. 

00:51:10
 (Laughing) 

00:51:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY So I gave each of you, one of these and in each of the four areas, I want you to draw one thing you can do to help yourself feel better when you get worried, like this person drew hugging their mom, playing soccer, praying and eating cookies. So draw something in each one, and then we're going to put it over our heads, like this. 

00:51:35
 (Laughing) 

00:51:35
 Here's a dozen(ph) short girl. 

00:51:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Symptom and Coping Charades. Ask children to act out a normal symptom children may have after a disaster. The child who guesses correctly acts out a helpful coping strategy to manage this symptom. 

00:51:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Now, we're gonna play Charades, and this is called, Symptom Charade, where sometimes kids notice changes in their body and, and their way that they feel, and their thoughts after something scary happens. So this is what we do. Charade is where you act out something and other people have to guess what it is. So, I'm gonna act out something. Okay, ready. Guess what it is? Yeah. 

00:52:20
 Sad. 

00:52:20

DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Role-plays. Ask children to role play how to ask for help from parents, other children and trusted adults. 

00:53:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Now, what we're gonna do, is we're going to pur, we're going to learn how to ask for help, okay, 'coz sometimes kids don't know how, how to ask for help. Sometimes this is what kids do. "I can't do it, come help me right now, hmmp." Now do you think people wanna help him after that? What, what do you think? 

00:53:30

00:54:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Paper Dolls Support Chain or Coping Necklace. Create a paper doll support chain in which linked images of dolls were labeled with names of people who can provide support or create a coping necklace in which pieces of paper are labeled with helpful coping strategies. Then place it around the child's neck. Rebuild Your World Sand Tray. If sand is available, place sand in a box or use rocks or wood to create a boundary around sand in the ground. Ask children to find things from nature, such as rocks, sticks, leaves, that they can use to rebuild their world. 

00:54:45
[sil.] 

00:54:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Oh, I see, you built something in the sandbox. Tell me about your sandbox. 

00:55:00

00:55:10
 Uhmm. 

00:55:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, good. 

00:55:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Group games. Sometimes children just need gross motor activity, such as running and jumping. Organize games, like Duck That Goose, relay races, crab soccer, volley beach ball, red light green light, and dancing. 

00:55:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, now we're gonna have relay races. 

00:55:35

00:56:15
  (Laughing) 

00:56:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Group free play. Sometimes children just need to play with toys in any way they choose. Structure the setting with limits on space and the number of children. Provide appropriate toys, like dolls, toy soldiers, animal families, cars, rescue vehicles, medical kits, nerf balls, blocks and paper and crayons. Consult with parents and teachers. Teach parents and guardians to conduct soothing sessions that may include massaging, rocking and singing to their children. Provide written information on normal symptoms children experience after disasters: warning signs, coping strategies, and resources. Consult with teachers about activities they can do in the classroom to help children calm down. And focus on their academic work. Thank you for watching, now you have some knowledge and skills to help children recover after disasters and crisis. Best wishes as you intervene with children.
