LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Good morning everybody. It's so good to be here and have this crowd at8:30 on Sunday morning. So welcome everybody. Are you enjoying the conference? Isn't it a wonderful conference? My husband does an incredible job. I'm really really proud of him. And everybody has been just wonderful, coming to me and saying how grateful they are, the conference has been just so good. So I thank you for everybody coming from other countries and spending those, a few days with us. So really appreciative. Cannot hear me? Now you can? My name is Lilian Borges Zeig. If you're wondering about my accent it's probably either because you don't know me or because you're not from Brazil. So I'm Brazilian. And I used to work in Brazil at the Milton Erickson institute back there. And also I had my own therapy clinic where I trained other professionals. I saw patients in the art of psychotherapy and also brief therapy. When I moved to the U.S. my career changed a little bit. I started traveling a little bit more with my husband, training other people, traveling around the world and also working at the Milton Erickson Foundation. Today, I'm gonna teach you a topic, I'm gonna talk to you about a topic that I usually teach at the intensives that we hold three times a year. And like this conference, people from everywhere come. And it's really fun. But the number of people is smaller. Today we have a wonderful crowd and I foresee that we are going to have a good time here today. And we are going to talk about a topic that yesterday Gilligan gave a great great opening. Steve, in his keynote was just really really good, inspiring, actually, for me. And a very good introduction to what we are going to be doing here today. Which is for me, utilization, we are going to talk about utilization in a trans-induction, specifically. Because once you learn utilization, you can start applying that to your life, you can start applying that with your patients in psychotherapy in different settings. But once they asked Dr. Erickson what he thought in his point of view were the contributions that he had for the field of psychotherapy. And he said, and also hypnosis, he said the confusion technique and utilization technique. So of course in our point of view it's much more than that. But utilization is, if you don't understand utilization you don't understand Ericksonian therapy. And today we are going, not only to talk about utilization, understanding it a little bit better, but we are going to do some activities that we are gonna realize it. And yesterday I was in a panel and the topic was again utilization. And the topic, there was the one person who came to us from the audience and asked, "All those cases that you're telling us are really interesting." And Dr. Erickson was amazing and was with John Friedman and John Bears and they were talking about cases. They're so creative and so wonderful. So one person of the attendants came and said, "Oh that's great, but how can we develop that in our lives? How can we incorporate that? How we mere mortals can do that as Dr. Erickson did?" And so that's what we are going to be doing here today. Right? Because utilization is not something that you can understand as actually Gilligan, Steve said yesterday, is not something that you can understand and do from here. Right? It's just like riding a bicycle. You can only learn by doing. I will change the format a little bit because of the number of people. But we are going to do a lot based on experience today. Okay? So let's start by, with a definition. And that definition is from Jeff Zad, utilization is the readiness of the therapist to respond strategically, I like that word right there, strategically to any and all aspects of the patient or the environment. So it's the readiness, it's that state that you get into and say bring it on, whatever you bring, we are going to play with it. And we are gonna get there. We are gonna get into trance and we are going to get to the goals that you have for the therapy. So let's not get thrown by the resistance of it or whatever or weird stuff or, it's not gonna. But you're just like bring it on. So actually the therapist gets into this state of responding positively to every stimulus, or stimuli that comes to him. And I like the word positively there, because it tells us that we have to change our lenses. We have to change the lenses and instead of seeing things and pathologizing things and giving diagnosis, we have to see that thing in a positive way. We see, we have to see that, what is this person doing, this person is doing his or her best. And trying to look for resources. Trying to look for other identities that aren't just a depressed person in front of you. Looking for other parts of the person. So it's just, we have to change those, are lenses. Also, it is, for me, it's not about therapeutic technique. When we say we get into this state, we are not doing anything. We are being something. Right? So since I'm not doing therapy, I'm being therapy. Right? So that is, have you ever been with a person that just by virtue of being with that person, you feel somehow different? Inspired? Relaxed? Or right? So we want to be in that state and for me that state is present. Being present. So we are going to get a little bit more about that flavor, how we can do that therapeutically. So we can consider utilization as a technique, as people say. As a principle in psychotherapy that you're going to utilize all that you can. It's an attitude. You step in not trying to do anything but you're being into that state that you're going to do the best with the cards that are given to you. It's a way of living. And actually that is Dr. Erickson's way of living. He was the quintessential wounded healer. He was dyslexic, he had polio, he suffered a lot of pain in his life, especially later in his life. He couldn't hear music. He only could hear noises. And all those things actually helped him and he said that polio was a very good teacher because he decided it was going to be a very good teacher. So it is a way of living. It's getting the lemons in life and making them lemonade. It's based on observation, observation, observation, observation. So pretty often he would send his students just to sit down and watch, observe people. And try to understand the meaning in their behavior. Because he would say that our unconscious mind is very subjective and is looking for meaning. What does that have to do with me? And again for you to observe and do that, you have to be present. You have to be in the present moment. So yesterday I was talking about a course that I did on improvisation. Improvisational techniques for theater. And it was with Alan Arkin, an Oscar winner actor. Excellent actor. And he was actually telling us his experiences with meditation and really a very present person. And but improv, you learn all those different exercises. And one of the exercises is everybody is in a circle and we have a ball. And we just throw the ball to the other person. That's the exercise. Right? But in the middle of the exercise, he looked at us and said, "Are you just throwing the ball? Are you waiting there, thinking about what you're going to do when you get the ball?" So in therapy, are you just throwing the ball, or you're thinking what you're going to do when the patient or if the patient says this or that or what technique I should be using. So being in the present moment is just throwing the ball and observing and being present. So you can do, you can use observation in psychotherapy, hypnosis and teaching and in life. Once you learn that. And to start, I would like to do a demonstration. And I would like to have someone here to help me with the demonstration. But this person who comes cannot understand a word of Portuguese. Cannot be Spanish speaking, cannot be Portuguese speaking. No, you understand everything that I say. You're from Brazil my darling. Okay. Who raised their hand first? So you don't understand a word of, thank you. So I think you need to sign this. 

00:13:40

00:13:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Thank you very much. Welcome. What's your name? Stuart. Thank you Stuart. Please sit down. And the reason, I think we need this, maybe not so much but just for the beginning. Does this work? 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN Sure. Can you hear me? Testing. 

00:14:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Testing. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN  Testing testing. 

00:14:25
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Yeah yeah it works. Thank you very much Stuart. So you don't understand a word of Portuguese. 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN  No. 

00:14:35
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Okay. So let's, 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN My son speaks fluent Brazilian Portuguese. But I understand none of it. 

00:14:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Okay. Okay. 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN But my son is 41 years old and he's at home. 

00:14:45
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Okay. Alright. So where are you from? 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN I'm from the Boston area. 

00:14:50
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Oh. I can tell by the accent. Okay. So the reason why I asked you to be here and I asked someone who couldn't speak Portuguese, is that I would like to do an induction with you in Portuguese. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Works for me. 

00:15:05
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  Works for you, yes. Yes. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN That's easy. Not a challenge, believe me. 

00:15:15

00:25:30
UNKNOWN  That woke me up. I didn't wanna wake up. 

00:25:35
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG It was here. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN  So you, I understood not a word. I mean some words were similar in English but very very few. 

00:25:45
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  You're very excited. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN I'm so excited because I didn't understand a word you were saying except some words that were, some words like level or something kinda similar to English. And all of a sudden my arm wanted to go up. And I had no, it's like how this happened because I don't understand what you're saying. So I didn't know whether you wanted my arm to go up, I had no idea. I just, bump, there it goes. My eyes are closed. I can't see any cues you're giving me. And I don't understand the language, but I was, were you trying to have levitation? 

00:26:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Actually no. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG No, not at all. Actually I was actually trying to wake you up. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN You were trying to wake me up? You gotta change your voice at the end. 

00:26:35
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG So at that moment I was inviting you to go up and then your unconscious mind brought something, another something up. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN Of course, yes. 

00:26:45
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  And. So what did I do that helped you to go into trance? 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN The tone, the pacing and the lovely music, the musical quality of your voice. It was just like a lullaby almost. 

00:27:10
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Did you notice at a certain point you started going deeper or that you came out or? 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN No, what I noticed was at, at the time you were trying to bring me out, I went deeper. 

00:27:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  Yeah, you did. You didn't wanna come out. I saw that. You were very comfortable there. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Yes, I'm very comfortable here. And so I didn't know you wanted me to come out. I did not know you wanted me to come out. So I thought, I didn't think, I wasn't really thinking, but what I was experiencing is when you put your hand, you touched me here to push me down, I thought oh. Boom, a deeper trance. I had no idea that you were trying to wake me up. 

00:28:10
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG I saw it, I saw that you didn't, actually I even said that, you didn't wanna come. Yeah. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN But you changed the pacing in your voice right at the end. 

00:28:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  Yeah, yeah. So you saw all the things that I did that helped you. Okay. And there was a point that you were smiling. 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:28:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Not laughing, but there was a point that you were smiling. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Yes yes. 

00:28:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG What were you smiling about? 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Oh I'm smiling because it's so pleasant. And it's like having this experience and it's like oh yes, this is nice. 

00:28:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  Thank you so much Stuart. You were just incredible. Thank you very much. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:00
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG I think it's just so, 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG That's excellent, thank you. So can you all hear me? I just love doing this exercise. Because then you can start seeing that hypnosis is not only the language of hypnosis. There is a lot of other things that are in hypnosis that is, that we are trying to utilize our human capacity to respond, our human capacity to respond. So I asked him why were you smiling in the middle of the induction. And why he was smiling? Do we know why he was smiling? Because there was a certain point, I started smiling and almost laughing. And he just responded. And I asked him, "Why did you do that?" "Oh no, it was so pleasant." We did that unconsciously. If you walk down the street, or you walk on the street in a mall or somewhere, and you walk with this smile on your face, right, people that you don't know will look at you and smile. It's just like an immediate response. And actually I tried that several times to see if when I learn, that is interesting, I'm gonna try that. And actually it works. People do respond unconsciously. At a certain point, I changed the way that I was breathing and breathing with him and talking only when he was breathing, when he was exhaling the air. So that brings a very like, atunement. Right? And, which is different to say just using the words, "I'm here with you." So that's what we're looking for when we are using hypnosis. We are using this common language to all human beings. We are using a language based on this ability that every single human being has to respond. And we are just observing to see how this person is observing, is responding. He responded like, "I'm so pleasant here, I don't wanna go anywhere. Don't tell me to come out. Out of the trance. I am enjoying." But he knew what I was asking from him. He said, "Oh, you wanted me to come, I didn't want to go." But did I tell him, I actually did tell him to come, to look. But I said that with my non-verbal, and he understood with my non-verbal. So we are looking for a language that's aesthetic, artistic. We are not looking for information. Information is good. But information only cannot induce someone to a trance. As Steve said yesterday, if I said, "You can relax right now." "Yeah, I know I can." But if I start smiling, and the person next to you starts smiling with you, that is trance. So we are looking and actually we are looking for this language of the flower blooming. Many many times we say many things in trance and don't let the person experience that. Actually you have to experience that first. We're the ones that put the toe in the swimming pool and say, "Oh, that's delicious. Let's go." And you go first. So hypnotic language is more than language of hypnosis that you saw yesterday with my husband, with Jeff Zeig. So it's important to learn and master the language but sometimes it's important to learn, master the silence. And sometimes using silence to let the person incorporate and respond to the suggestions and the words that you gave. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG So now we are going to bring a little bit more information and this is another quotation, another from O'Hallen who actually is, I think, presenting next door or he will present here later. The therapist or the hypnotist uses the person's visual, mental habits, resistance, symptoms, behaviors, delusions or any aspect of the person's internal or external behavior in service of the treatment or the trance induction. So what the heck is that? So we have three ways to do utilization in a trance induction. One is incorporation. You incorporate different things from the reality situation into the induction. So Dr. Erickson was famous for answering the telephone in the middle of a session or in the middle of induction and he would utilize that to create amnesia. Right? So if you're in the middle of conversation, you pick up the phone and you talk, what happens when you go back to the conversation? You forget, don't you? You create amnesia. So here you just utilize everything in front of you. Right? So you are doing an induction and someone knocks on the door, someone, there is a noise, there is something that happens, you could stop the trance or you could incorporate that. And you could keep going. It's like the dream. Have you ever had a dream that you are, there's a telephone ringing or the doorbell is ringing and then you dream that there's a telephone ringing and then you wake up and there is actually the telephone that is ringing. Actually your unconscious mind is incorporating that. That's the language of the unconscious. So you could actually keep sleeping. But so that is incorporation. 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Another way is the ratification. You probably had learned about the ARE model. And we know that A stands for absorption. R stands for ratification. And E is for elicitation of resources and responses. So R is the ratification and when you ratify, when you say, as I've been talking to you, your breathing rate had changed, you're more relaxed. And you start observing what are the responses that the person, what are the signs that the person is presenting that tells you yes, that tells him or her yes, you are in trance. Yes, you are responding. Yes, you are in a different state. Yes, you are doing well. So ratification is utilization. You just observe what is in front of you, then you just feed that back to the person. Next one is positive attribution. And positive attribution adds actually an additional meaning to any observed behavior, or specific observed behavior to maintain a patient in trance. So, for instance, again, if you're doing a trance or induction, and the person starts crying. You can have, you may have the option to bring the person back. That's perfectly fine and talk about that. But if you know what's going on, it's a patient that you're working with and you know that is in grieving or in depression or whatever. And you don't want to bring the person back but you want just to continue the trance. You may say, you may give a positive attribution and keep going. And you may, might say, and there are different kinds of tears. Tears of happiness. Tears of sadness. Tears that heal and wash away old wounds. So you don't know what those tears are about. But you just give a positive attribution and you just move on. Keep going. So you incorporate that in a positive way. Some patients sometimes come back from a trance and they start saying, "I have a little bit of a headache." And you might say, "Sometimes when we digest things that are a little toxic or something that doesn't make you so well, you might have a headache. Or sometimes you might say, "You know, sometimes just the headache is just something to go away, it needs to be stronger first, like when a light bulb goes away, it shines brighter before it burns." So you see everything as part of the healing process. You are in a healing process. So this is part of the healing process. Whether you call it positive or negative, you are in a path. And this just came to you for a reason and it'll go away. So we are going to have an exercise and to do this exercise, I think I will need, I will demonstrate and then you will do the exercise. So I think I'll need two people to demonstrate this exercise. And those two people actually do need to understand English. One more. So I think that I need you guys to sign. And I need one chair, can anyone help me bring another chair here? I appreciate it, thank you very much. 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Oh, thank you. Thank you John. 

00:41:45
[sil.] 

00:42:05
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Good. Yes please. Hi. How are you doing? 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Hi, I'm Diane. 

00:42:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Diane. Please. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN  Lou. 

00:42:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Hi Lou. How are you doing? 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN Very good. 

00:42:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG So let's sit down and we are going to demonstrate this exercise. Alright? One of you is going to be the client. And one of you is going to be an irritant. You can decide who's going to be the client, who's going to be the irritant. Don't be limited by the chair. But. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN I can be the irritant. 

00:42:45
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Okay. Alright. She will be the irritant. So irritant. Yes. So this is how the exercise goes. So I will do a simple induction. Very simple induction. And you will name an object in the room and you're just gonna say it. Right? And you're gonna give me a few seconds, 20, 40, you know and you'll see that I use that somehow. And then you'll make a noise. No, it can be any noise. You can sneeze. You can, whatever you wanna do. Right? Don't tell me. And the other one is name a sensation or a feeling. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN In about 20 or 40 seconds. 

00:43:45
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Yes. So you wait, you say something. Name an object in the room, for instance a chair. Right? And then you wait a little bit, after 40 seconds or so, you make a noise. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:43:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And then you wait a little bit and then after that you name a sensation or a feeling. And then after that, you do something absurd or idiosyncratic. You like that one. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN I'm looking forward to that. Yes. 

00:44:10
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG So my job is to utilize what you bring. Okay? 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Okay. Yes. And your job is to go into trance. You can do that? Hopefully I will help you with that. I know that you can do that. Hopefully I will be of some help. Okay. So actually you are in an excellent position to go into trance, aren't you Lou? I have a very very good friend. His name is also Lou. So I think when I think about him, and I hear your name, and I think about him, good feelings come to me. You know, maybe you can close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And just leave the weight to the support of the chair. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN  Smoke alarm. 

00:45:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  And you don't need any smoke alarm or anything that comes to your mind. You don't need anything to alert you at this moment. You can just let yourself go into this experience. 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:05
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And you can squeeze sneezes into this experience. Noticing that you can hear a lot of noises around you. And somehow that doesn't matter. Actually you can utilize that to go deeper and deeper into this experience. It is as if you are in a cloud of comfort. 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN  Scared. 

00:46:50
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  It might be different feelings inside of you. Might not be any feeling inside of you. Might be interesting to observe how the comfort may develop as you just let yourself go. 

00:47:25
[sil.] 

00:47:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG It's almost like being in the eye of a hurricane. When things are moving and noises are around you and you're just there. And it's not even funny. It's a place of I don't know, comfortable silence, comfortable silence. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And stillness inside. 

00:48:30
[sil.] 

00:48:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Now Louise, I would invite you to start coming back here. And as I said, that your head just moved up a little bit. And I like what you're doing, which is bringing yourself back, maybe you want to move your hands at your own pace, in your own rhythm. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:49:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Thank you Lou. Thank you Diane. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:25
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Oh, okay, thank you. So that is the exercise. Right? And I would like you to, I would like you to do this exercise with a peer. Right? You will get three people, one is going to be the therapist, another one is going to be the irritant and the other one is going to be the client. And you are going to start doing a very simple induction. And the therapist, actually this is an exercise for the therapist. And the therapist will get into this state of nothing will throw me out of this state that I am. And actually I'm actually curious and looking forward to utilize anything. And so I would invite you to do it and try this exercise and actually enjoy this exercise. And do you have any questions for me regarding the demonstration, regarding the exercise? And if you do, please go to the mike. It's clear, isn't it? He does have. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN My only thought about this is having been here for three days, is that there's enough activity noise in the room, you hardly need a third person to disrupt you. 

00:51:00
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG That is true. That is true. That is true. It's just that having the other person there has this a little bit of dramatic that I like, that makes it into a game, that is more interesting. So just make things more interesting for you guys. And then I will tell you my story, a very interesting story later. But first, I'll give you a few minutes to do the exercise and then we continue. Okay? So how was it? Wasn't it fun? You know that I love watching you guys doing this exercise. I just love it. Because I, you have so much fun doing it. And doing a trance induction should be that much fun. We should incorporate that and be happy and welcoming to everything that the person is bringing to you. And so I saw people jumping and I saw people laughing. I saw people clapping. I saw people, so that should be part of the induction. Strategically. So we are thinking, "Why am I using this when I'm doing the trance?" And regarding this exercise, and regarding the incorporation, you can do that metaphorically or you can do that literally. Meaning if someone knocks on the door, you can say, you can hear the noises and still be in the trance and go, or use the noises to go deeper and deeper. So that is literally utilizing that literally. But sometimes you want to use that metaphorically. And you hear new things knocking at this very moment. New experiences, new thoughts, new insights are just knocking at your door. So you can do both. Right? Not utilizing would be not mentioning it. So if you just try to ignore the noise or whatever that is there, it's when you are not utilizing it. But if you mention it literally, that is actually you utilizing it. So here we are also getting to know a little bit more about our non-verbal behavior and how we can utilize that. How we can utilize our non-verbal behavior to help to go, the person to go into trance. So someone asked me even though the person is not, doesn't have the eyes open, do I have to or should I use my arms and make gestures? Yes. Because that is part of your communication as well. And with him, you saw that when I was smiling, he started smiling as well. He didn't see me. He didn't have his eyes open. But he responded. And what happens when you start smiling? You go into trance happy. It's a happy trance. Right? So I suggest to you to use that. Use the smile. So instead of saying, "Now you can be happy," no you get to be happy first. And you bring that to your face and smile to your face, you bring that to you first. And then the person will respond. And we are going to have another exercise if we have time, so you can train that. And that's actually fabulous. Happy about that. So, hmmm. So I think we are going to do one more exercise. And I'm going to demonstrate this exercise because we have time, before we talk about resistance, because I want to talk resistance last. So I think I will just do a demonstration and this, I'm just talking to you about. I need another person to come here and help me with that. And please.

00:57:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Thank you. And welcome. Hi, what's your name? 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Angie. 

00:57:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Angie. Thank you very much. Angie. Remind me of angels. Thank you. 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN Nervous angels. 

00:57:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Nervous angels. We can be nervous as well. And many other things. Okay. But actually, this is a very simple exercise. Very simple. And so if you want to take a look at the exercise in the back because I'm gonna explain this a little bit. And by now you know what a truism is. Right? And a truism comes from a true, saying things that are true, that we are all here. I'm sitting down. You're just looking at me right now. Those are all true things and they're truisms. Right? And another truism is that you can relax. And so every time that we use the word can and then we say something later, not every time, but we can turn information into a truism. Like you can relax, you can pay attention to my words and you can breathe deeply and go into trance. So they're all truisms. Right? And what I'm gonna do is that, three truisms, one suggestion. And that is the suggestion that I'm gonna make. Which is you can go into trance or you can go deeper and deeper into trance. What I would suggest you wanna do. You wanna make. And then I'm gonna ask her what are you experiencing now. And you just answer me. I'm gonna use that as a truism because she just told me, so that is true. So I'm using that truism. I'm gonna say two more truisms and then I'm gonna make the suggestion again. That you can go into trance or you can go deeper and deeper into trance. And I ask you the question again. What are you experiencing now? So actually I have there two cycles. And we are going to do this for three cycles. Okay? I'm gonna ask you three times, what are you experiencing now. And I'm just gonna say that back to you, say two more truisms and ask you the question, make the suggestion, ask the question again. Good? Now that your unconscious mind understands that, understood that very well. Yeah. It did. I think you don't need the microphone right now. Thank you. And you are sitting here and you're looking and smiling at me. And you just blinked and blinked again. And nod your head. And you can go into trance. What are you experiencing now? 

01:01:10
[sil.] 

01:01:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG You're experiencing calm. You just, your head just fell. Somehow. And that somehow changed the way that you breathe. 

01:01:40
[sil.] 

01:01:45
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And you have your hands on your lap. And you can go deeper and deeper into this state. What are you experiencing now Angie? 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN  Warm. 

01:02:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  You are warm. You can listen to my words. You can let that warmth envelope you. And you can go deeper and deeper into trance. 

01:02:50
[sil.] 

01:03:00
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG What are you experiencing now? 

01:03:05
[sil.] 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN I feel light. 

01:03:20
[sil.] 

01:03:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG You feel light. 

01:03:25
[sil.] 

01:03:35
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And that light is part of your experience. 

01:03:40
[sil.] 

01:03:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And your breathing rhythm had changed. As you are into this experience. 

01:04:15
[sil.] 

01:04:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And your body, your face doesn't move so much. And there is this interesting way that your head just looks down. And you can go deeper and deeper into trance. What are you experiencing now? 

01:05:05
[sil.] 

01:05:10
UNKNOWN My mouth doesn't wanna work. 

01:05:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Your mouth doesn't wanna work? Who doesn't wanna work? 

01:05:20
UNKNOWN My mouth. 

01:05:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And your mouth doesn't wanna work. And I would invite you to maybe taking one or two or three easy breaths Angie. Start taking one or two or three easy breaths, start coming back to here and now. And your mouth and your body might not want to. Yeah. But I would invite you to come back here and now. Maybe you may start moving your hands and your feet and bringing yourself to here and now. And your face. Thank you. Welcome. How was it? 

01:06:15
UNKNOWN It was very. 

01:06:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  It's on. 

01:06:25
UNKNOWN It's interesting. 

01:06:25
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG It was very, can you hear me? They are working on it. But you can tell me, I can tell them. 

01:06:30
UNKNOWN I was still nervous. But the more I concentrated on your voice and you became focused on being inside, it seemed to go away. And like I could feel tremors in my face. Yeah. 

01:06:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG How about now? 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN Now I feel fine. Which is very weird because when I do presentations, I have to fight off an anxiety attack the whole time. So I do feel very comfortable. 

01:07:10
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Yeah. You could memorize this moment. 

01:07:10
UNKNOWN I will. 

01:07:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG No, you won't. Do it right now. Memorize it. 

01:07:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:07:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG And put it somewhere inside of you. A place where you put all other learnings that you had. It's like learning how to ride a bike. It's somewhere there. But just next to it. It's impossible to unlearn how to ride a bike. 

01:07:50
UNKNOWN  That's true. 

01:07:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Right? There you go. Put this next to that learning. 

01:07:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:07:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  Okay? Thank you very much Angie. 

01:08:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:08:05
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  Okay. So that is the exercise. Very simple exercise. Very very simple. If you want to make a question, you have to go to the mike. Thank you very much. 

01:08:25
[sil.] 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN Hi. 

01:08:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Hi. 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN I was just interested to know what does that do for the patient's experience, for the subject's experience to say truisms about what you see? To say things like your breathing has changed, your hands are resting... 

01:08:45
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG You're going to experience right now that. So you're gonna do the exercise and then you're gonna experience that and then you answer your own question. How does that sound? Because it is, how can I, we can ask her. We can ask Angie. But every single person will have a different answer for that. Every single person will have a different answer for that. But with her, and this is a twist that I'm gonna ask you to incorporate. I would like you to say those things and you're gonna speak with the person only when they are exhaling. Ha ha. Right? And you could, something else that you could add, you could talk to the person while you're smiling. Right? But again you have to do that and wait for the person to be able to respond. Right? So don't use too many otherwise the person gets and you get confused. Again it is the presence that you are trying to get. There was a person who wanted to ask something. Where did you go? 

01:10:10
UNKNOWN  I answered my own question. 

01:10:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG You did? Very good. That happens. That's okay. 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN Say that when you're doing the induction, if you were to say something like you have a very kind face or your eyes are very beautiful, is that going too far? With the truisms, I get it. 

01:10:35
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Anything that can bring interjections, I would not say that is a truism. A person might not think that, you know? The truism has to have this yes answer inside. So the person might not be feeling so pretty today. And you say, "You're pretty," and she says, "Oh, but I don't feel so pretty today." 

01:11:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:00
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG So you want to have, I say, "You're looking at me." You say, "Yes, I am." And you're nodding your head. And you say, "Yes, I am." And I'm about to leave, it's just, I'm saying things that you cannot refute, that you cannot refute. 

01:11:20
UNKNOWN A truism there. 

01:11:20
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG They are truisms. You cannot refuse those things. 

01:11:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

01:11:25
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Make sense? 

01:11:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:11:25
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Okay. Does it make sense? Okay. Any other questions? So again, find a partner, do the three cycles and you're gonna see that after three cycles, the person, the mouth doesn't wanna work anymore. So just three cycles, change roles. So how was it? Good? You guys started talking loud and some people couldn't do the exercise. So I thought you were ready to come back. You responded. I just. 

01:12:10
[sil.] 

01:12:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Yeah, I give a little bit less. I'm sorry. But again, I saw, I was walking around, saw people complaining about the noise was too loud, and then just responding to you guys. I heard, it's time to go back. So I usually don't do this exercise or don't do this induction with my patients. But it is an interesting exercise or interesting thing when you lose the rapport with patients. If somehow you lose a rapport, the best way to go back to rapport is just observing. And patient is not there on a wall, is there in front of you, so keep your eye on the patient and behaviors that they are having. And it's interesting that sometimes you go into trance and we either close our eyes or look at the ceiling or somewhere that is not the patient. We should go into a trance, yes. But an externally focused trance. And our focus is the patient. Cause you don't wanna lose the rapport there. You don't wanna get into rapport only with yourself. You want to be in that dance, because you want to be responding to what, and seeing what the person is and how the person is responding to you. How are you gonna see how the person is responding to you if you don't look at the person? Right. So the first is keep your eyes open and look at your patient. And observe observe, observe. Second, I'm sorry, but I don't know if it was my observational skills, I didn't see many people following the breath, at least at the times that I saw. I saw that John Suderland, from Phoenix, where are you John? Raise your hand. You did good. I saw that he was doing that. Yay! And of course I just spent a few seconds with walking around but did you use, did you talk as the person exhaled? Yes you did. Oh great. So how was that? Good? Yes. And some people, some students come to me sometimes and say, "How do we know?" It's just observe. Here. At this point. 

01:14:50
UNKNOWN  My question is, and I couldn't hear when you were demonstrating, 

01:14:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Oh I'm sorry. 

01:15:00
UNKNOWN But, well that's okay. I can buy the DVDs. But, what I didn't hear was when you say, "What are you experiencing now?" Did she answer you out loud? Or you just, 

01:15:15
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG She did. And I didn't bring the microphone because I was just repeating what she said. So I thought that she didn't need to hold the microphone then. 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:15:25
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG But I was, so whatever she told me, I just repeated back. 

01:15:30
UNKNOWN But you expected her to say something to you. 

01:15:35
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Yes. 

01:15:35
UNKNOWN So what if they don't? 

01:15:40
[sil.] 

01:15:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG You know, if they're not saying anything, say, "You're not answering me." That is a truism. 

01:15:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Alright. 

01:15:50
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Or maybe you are answering me in another way. Or maybe, you know. You're not answering me verbally. But you can answer me in other ways. 

01:16:00
UNKNOWN Okay. I appreciate that. Alright. 

01:16:05
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Thank you. And I'm sorry that you couldn't hear. But the reason why I thought it was going to be uncomfortable for her to hold the mike and since I was repeating, I thought that there was no need for the mike. And also, it's a simple exercise. But people can go so deeply into it. Did you answer your question? What's your name? Did you answer your question? 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN I think so. I don't know that I felt it necessarily but I think this adds the ability of the relationship and the therapist, truisms that you cannot refute. 

01:16:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG It adds to the credibility of the therapist and the therapy. So it does. And also adds something else. This person is present with me. This person is here with me. It's following me. You know the experience is just following me, so I feel very welcomed, accepted, and in tune with the patient. So that's that. Any other question or comment regarding this exercise? 

01:17:25
[sil.] 

01:17:25
UNKNOWN My one comment was in terms of the distraction of the other people in the room, everyone was talking about going deeper. So it's amplified. We were working on going deeper and I was hearing deeper, deeper, deeper. 

01:17:50
[sil.] 

01:17:55
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG So you're not the only therapist there. There was plenty. Many of those reinforcing the suggestion. Any other comment or, any other comment or question regarding how to utilize the non-verbal aspects of the communication in a trance? How to utilize that. And again, yes, please go to the mike. And again, I think I didn't mention this. So when we say utilization and actually when we hear, when we see on Helen's quote or definition of utilization, it didn't say that we utilize ourselves. So utilization is not only utilizing things from the exterior or the environment or the patient. It's also utilizing your own abilities and your own self into therapy. 

01:19:00
UNKNOWN I just wondered if you could explain a little bit more about why you suggested to speak only on the exhale of the client during that last exercise. 

01:19:10
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG  Because when you speak when you are, if you notice when you are speaking, what happens when you speak? You exhale when you speak. You'll be matched. Yeah. Could be. So you are more relaxed when you exhale. Yes. But my reasoning is, and it's a very good one, but my reasoning is you are exhaling when you're speaking. So if you're doing that with your patient, you are in perfect resonance with the patient. And sometimes your communication gets a little broken because sometimes the breathing in the middle of a sentence, in the middle of a word. But does it matter? Sometimes it doesn't matter. Sometimes you can again, utilize that. So let's talk a little bit, because we have 15 minutes only, I get too excited. Oops. What have I done? 

01:20:35
[sil.] 

01:20:40
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Oh. 

01:20:45
[sil.] 

01:20:50
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Oh, there we go. So let's talk a little bit about resistance. And usually I do this exercise but I, so I didn't have a way of, or didn't think of entertaining doing this exercise here with this group because usually as people want to be the therapist and the other want to be the client. And then when we found out who was the therapist, we sent all the therapists out of the room and then I tell the patients to be resistant. Now you're gonna choose one resistance. And when your therapist comes in, you don't tell your therapist that you are going to be resistant or the kind of resistance that you are gonna present. But just choose one resistant. And could be that you are tense, that you are not responding to the therapist. It may be that you start laughing or yawning or fidgeting. Or, choose one kind of resistance. Or you start talking as you have your eyes closed. Choose one kind of resistance and just increase that over time. So it is not so noticeable. So it is very entertaining, very funny. Again, I like bringing this idea of don't fight the resistance, just welcome the resistance and just utilize that. That is the door that is open for you. So just don't try to push the doors. This door is just opening for you, so just go ahead and utilize that. So this is actually Dr. Erickson said, if they bring in resistance, be grateful for that resistance. Hit it up in whatever fashion they want you to really pile it up. But never get disgusted with the amount of resistance, whatever the patient presents to you in your office, you really ought to use. Right? So every time that I talk about resistance, I think about this case that I read about Dr. Erickson. And this is the case. So this man comes in and storms into Dr. Erickson's office and he starts pacing and says, "Dr. Erickson, I know that you're not gonna be able to help me. And I know because I've been to so many doctors. And I'm just so anxious that I cannot sit down. And that's why nobody can help me. I cannot even sit down to tell my problems so nobody was able to help me so far. You are my last resort but I don't have much hope. Because I'm just so anxious, I'm just so anxious that I cannot just." And he just kept talking, just pacing from one side to the other. Dr. Erickson said, "Do you mind if I talk to you as you walk?" He said, "No." And what Dr. Erickson did was just making comments about what he was doing. So now you go from this corner of the room to the other one. And now you just turn and you turn and you laugh and then you just look and before you look, you just turn your body. And he started just describing everything that he was doing. Until he noticed that the guy was waiting for his comments to behave. And then he said, "And now you turn towards your right and then you look at those chairs and you might be wondering which one is more comfortable to sit down." I like this. This is utilization right there. This is why we have been doing it. Right? This morning. And this is what you actually are incorporating right now. And so he didn't say, "No, I cannot see you. No you have to sit down." He actually said, "You know I welcome with whoever you are. I welcome." And then eventually he would redirect. He would add small little things that are very easy. It's almost like, "You know, could you do this in small, little steps?" And he said, "Sure." "And how about this other little step over here?" "Yeah, why not?" "And maybe this one will follow." All of a sudden you look back and you had walked a big distance without even noticing. So that's what Dr. Erickson would just observing people and just, it just being in the present moment and then eventually the patient will just give you the answer eventually. But there is another one that I like very much. Because sometimes there is not only resistance, there are symptoms that you don't know how to utilize. So, and now I'm expanding a little bit not only in the realm of the trance induction, but also in the psychotherapy. It's easier to demonstrate, because we don't have time to demonstrate how to utilize the resistance. But we are going to be talking about that right now. So one of the things is you know that Dr. Erickson worked in a psychiatric hospital. And worked with schizophrenic patients. And there was one patient who would just speak the word salad. And there was this patient that he, people that would come into the psychiatric ward of the hospital, he would just jump in front of the person and would just say the word salad and just leave. And it was a chronic patient, it was just there, didn't have any communication or contact with other people. So what Dr. Erickson did, he asked his assistant to come and copy the speech of the guy, so he could learn the pattern of the word salad. And that's what he did. So one day he came in, the guy jumped in front of him and just did the word salad, Dr. Erickson looked at him, did the word salad back to him and said, "Nice meeting you. My name is Milton." Or Dr. Erickson. And he said, "Oh, nice meeting you. My name is such and such. And it's nice to finally meet someone that makes sense in this hospital." 

01:28:25
[sil.] 

01:28:30
LILIAN BORGES ZEIG Again, is utilization the whole therapy? No. It was a way of entering the person's phenomenal(ph) logical world. And then once you have that rapport, once you're in, then you know how to rearrange the furniture. But you need to have a way in the house. So utilization is a way in. Right? So another case is Dr. Erickson with Jesus Christ. There was a guy there that was Jesus Christ. And he came to the guy and said, "Good morning my Lord." And he started talking to him and he said, "I know that you have a lot of experience with carpentry." He said, "Yes, my son." And he said, "We are having a lot of trouble in the carpentry here at the hospital. Could you please please help us?" And he said, "Of course." And then he started working at the carpentry and again it's a way in. How you get in, just utilizing the person's beliefs, the person's words, the person's ability to respond, values. So just observing and instead of saying, "No, you have to change and let me explain about." Instead of trying to explain, just accepting and trying to utilize that somehow. And with resistance, when you are in a trance induction is about the same. I remember doing an induction with a friend when I was in Brazil, learning how to do inductions. And I was doing, we were practicing on each other in a workshop. And I remember that I started doing a trance induction with her, it was a very good friend. She started laughing. I said, "What friend are you? You should help me here." And actually it was a very good experience for me because then I came up with this, I thought about this cartoon, Garfield cartoon. And there's Garfield and that little dog that he, I think it's Ogie. He hated the dog. And then there's Garfield and he's walking and then the next one is him looking at Ogie and then slapping him. And the next one he said, Garfield said, "You are laughing inside." That was his excuse for smacking Ogie. But then all of a sudden that hallucination came to my mind and I started thinking, "Oh it's wonderful to go into trance laughing." Because when you laugh, you laugh inside, your whole body laughs with you. So I wonder how is the laughing sensation in your feet. And in your stomach. In your head. So I started and all of a sudden she didn't need to laugh anymore. I said, "It's wonderful." You can go into trance laughing. You can go into trance being nervous. Right Angie? You can go into trance tense. You can go into trance dancing. There are so many wonderful ways to go into trance. And I welcome that. So actually my friend said it was a wonderful experience because she really started feeling that laughing sensation all over. So that actually was a very good learning experience for me. Again, is accepting whatever, getting to that state of bring it on. And then redirecting. Just adding small little differences that will help the person get out of that state that they are at. Right? So let me tell you this case. Yesterday, that case was in Steve's, Gilligan's PowerPoint. But he ended up not telling you this story. So and actually I, the first time I heard, I heard it from him. But since he didn't say, he didn't tell, I think it's an excellent way of ending our morning. Because I think it's a beautiful story of how utilizing people's, a beautiful story of utilization. So Dr. Erickson was going to Milwaukee. And one of his students came to him and said, "Dr. Erickson, I know that you're going to Milwaukee. My aunt lives there. Please go see her. She is a very rich widow, lonely, depressed woman. And she's living by herself. And the family thinks that she's suicidal. Please go help us. Go see her." And he said yes. So he went there, knocked on the door, and he's a doctor at that time, doctors have a different reputation and than they have nowadays. But he knocked on the door and he came in and he started talking to her. And he saw that she really presented that mask, the depressive mask that people don't respond, just one or two words and not much responsive. And so he asked her to take a look at the house. And he saw that the house was one room, darker than the other. And not much light. And but he saw a place where she had a lot of violets. And at that moment, again, he is looking with utilization glasses, looking what this person is doing good, what is this person, what is the resources. How can I utilize. And he saw life there. So he went downstairs and again, as I said, at that time, doctors gave you prescriptions you would follow. So he said, "Go to the store and buy vases, buy earth, land, soil." Thank you. "And African violets. And ask your assistant," there was a maid that would come and help her every week, "To plant different vases." He knew that she would go to church every day. And that's the only thing that she would, only social thing that she would do. But she would go, go to mass, and com back, would not interact with anyone. So he told her, "Every time that you go to church, if you saw that there is a wedding, baptism, celebration somehow, you go and you give a flower to that family." So what would happen to you if you are having a baptism of your grandchild or of your child? And this old lady comes to you and gives you a flower? You would notice her, right? Not only would you notice, but you would be grateful to her and invite her. So the obituary in the Milwaukee newspaper ten years later said, "The African violet queen of Milwaukee dies." Thousand people cry over her death. So again is how you change your lenses, being present, and utilize what, when you see life, when you see that person's resources and doing good things and how you get that nugget and you must stretch it, you stretch it. You stretch it. I'm happy. I think it's a good sign. I had a lot of fun this morning, talking about a topic that is my passion. And you have been just great. And I wish you a great Sunday and rest of your conference. Thank you.

BILL O'HANLON Okay. welcome here. I start on time. My clock says it's on time and actually a minute or two late. So I had to wait for the microphone. I have my cellphone up here to remind me and to remind you to turn off your cellphone or put it on the stunt mode, or silent mode or whatever you do so it doesn't disturb you or disturb me or disturb the people around you. So I'd appreciate it if you do that. One more bit of logistics. All of us as faculty members were supposed to upload our handouts to the Erickson foundation website. Mine are up there. In addition, I have slides. And I do not send those ahead because I change them all the time. I changed them last night, before I did this. So these are the updated versions and they will be, within the next few days, on my website. That's Bill O'Hanlon dot com. If you go there and you find some, a little thing on the side that says free stuff, click that. And then a bunch of other stuff will show up and slides is one of those. There'll be slides from the other presentations, the presentation I did there here that had slides on depression, dealing with depression. And then slides from other workshops, if you wanna get those. You're welcome to use my handouts. You're welcome to distribute them to other people, give them away. Colleagues, friends that aren't here. Clients, patients, if that's appropriate. You're welcome to use my slides as well for the same purpose. You can give them away, you can share them with other people. I'm out here to change minds and to influence people. I'm always happy for people to share that. If you use them with something commercial, you should contact me directly to get permission. I'll probably give you permission. Alright, with that out of the way, you can just relax and maybe you wanna take notes to listen. But the handouts and the slides will cover the major points. So you're welcome to just sit and absorb this and experience it. Or you're welcome to take notes as well. Alright. So you've been in this, some of you have been in this track the whole time. You've been kinda following along. Some of you are just dropping in for this. And so it's a little challenging for me to figure out what you've heard so far. A few people other than I who had similar kind of ideas coordinated. But I didn't see everybody's ideas. So I'm gonna assume by now you know how to invite a person into trance in a compelling way. Either you've gotten that from this track or you knew that before. And the second question for me when I used to go to hypnotics workshops, they spend a lot of time on how to induce a trance. And then what you do when you get them there, it's like, it's a little vague. Do therapy with them. Or something. So there are two things I think to do and this is one of them. One of the things that I think characterizes hypnosis is the ability to get one's hand on the control nob of automatic experience. Like if I just told you, you're gonna have an operation. What I'd like you to do is bleed a little from the incision, and then stop the bleeding. You would say, "Yeah, good. But I don't know how to do that." And that's precisely what hypnosis is good at, is controlling the things we don't have conscious deliberate control about. And so what we're trying to do with hypnosis, is get some influence on that stuff and determine whether we have that influence and this is the mechanism, the means by which we determine that and by which we evoke it. So hypnotic phenomenon are these weird things that people in the early days of hypnosis; Mesmer and James Brade and Shoc Coejenae(ph) they discovered that people spontaneously did when they went into trance. They had distortions or shifts in memory, in time experience, in sensation, in perception, in bodily experience, muscle movements. And these distortions were in two predictable directions. One is they would have an enhancement, if you had the control nob and you turned it up, like the restat for the lights, if you could turn it up, they would have hand levitation or automatic handwriting, if it was in the muscular realm. They would have revivification of memories, if it was in the memory realm. Or they would turn, be turned down or diminished or eliminated. And that is, you'd have amnesia if it was in the memory realm. Or you would have catalepsy if it was in the muscle realm, the muscle movement realm. Or so early pioneers in what came to be called hypnosis, mesmerism or whatever you wanna call it at first, discovered that people spontaneously did these things. They would come out of trance and thing that it had been five minutes when it was actually two hours or an hour. So there was natural time distortion. And then they decided, okay, once we put a person in trance, we're gonna suggest these changes to convince the person and to convince us that they're in trance. And I would suggest there's another reason for it; so that you can get to that automatic stuff, to change it. Erickson would sometimes put people in trance and just give them a lot of experience, teach them the trance phenomenon, if you will. He would get them to have a lot of experience with it because he never knew which one he wanted to use for treatment and he also wanted to get them to be better trance subjects where they can more readily do this stuff. I think there's usually a particular reason why you want to evoke and use a particular trance phenomenon. We'll talk about that as we go along. Okay? So just to make sure we're clear, because some people may have just dropped in, some people are kinda new, and some people have a background in traditional hypnosis. That is not my approach. I was really warped by Erickson in the direction of a more permissive versus authoritarian approach, where you say you can rather than you will. Where you say you could rather than you are. Instead of saying your eyes are getting heavier and heavier, that's traditional authoritarian, the Ericksonian side of things was much more permissive. You could, your eyes could close. And also permission, they don't have to close. So you give people a lot more degrees of freedom. In the traditional approach, you're supposed to establish your authority as the person who gets people to do things and that's how the hypnosis works; by suggestion, command and authority. That never appealed to me as an approach, partly maybe because I was molested when I was a kid and I don't like people messing with me. You know? And so this approach to hypnosis, where it's more smorgasbord of possibilities and a lot more permissive, appeals to me. Now Erickson was a bit of a combination because he was, he started as an authoritarian hypnotist and then over the years he developed the utilization approach, which we heard from Steve Gilligan last night and permissive suggestions and possibilities. And a few other things; indirect approaches to hypnosis. So here's Zoran to remind us of the traditional approach.

UNKNOWN Hi. I'm Zoran Zoran. The world's fastest hypnotist. 

01:47:05
BILL O'HANLON Wait. 

01:47:05
UNKNOWN That's right. Here to tell you about my new audio tape series. To improve your life through hypnosis called improving your life through hypnosis. That's right. With my tape series, you will receive one tape in the mail. Entitled "Buy more tapes through hypnosis." That's right. I promise you will then feel the need to buy more tapes. Like getting women to like you through hypnosis. Hypnotizing those around you without them knowing. Hypnotizing through the television. That's right. Achieving polygamy through hypnosis. Hey thanks for watching about yourself but suddenly gave to me for no reason through hypnosis. And improving your tennis. That's right. If you order my tapes series you will forget to cancel it. That's right. You will want to cancel it. You'll kick yourself when the tapes come. But you won't cancel my series. That's right. And you will also order my workout tape. Zoran to the oldies. That's right. Here's the number. Dial.

01:48:50
BILL O'HANLON Alright. Zoran. And that's what I'm saying not to do, just to be clear. Okay? The other distinction and I said this the other day when I was doing a demonstration on hypnosis which is sort of what I call my version of Ericksonian hypnosis, I don't think hypnosis has anything to do with suggestion. That's a radical idea, I think. But what I learned from Erickson was as Steve Langton and Carol Langton's book is called, "The Answer Within." You evoke things from people rather than add from the outside. They have the capacities, the potentials, the capabilities to do things. And one of the things that convinces them of this, it's evocative rather than suggestive, one of the things that convinces them of this is trance phenomenon. That's the stuff that people already have an ability to do. Now let me give you an example. I got a new pair of glasses, this pair of glasses. And I used to have, somebody saw me in the other ones today, they're kind of John Lennon, wireless, round rim, round rimless glasses. And I get these glasses and I see the rims. For the first day or two. And then I don't notice them anymore. Now those of you who know hypnosis, know that this is a minor everyday example of negative hallucination. That is, there is something in your sensory field that is potentially there that you don't notice. Like somebody's in trance and somebody claps their hands really hard next to theirs. And they don't flinch. Everybody else in the room flinches cause they can hear it. This person is hypnotically deaf. That's negative hallucination. In everyday life we use these trance phenomena just not in such amplified ways and this is one of the things that hypnosis can do; can give you access to turning up or turning down this ability of negative hallucination, positive hallucination, time distortion, time expansion, time contraction, all these possibilities in the realm of inner experience, sensations, perceptions, memory, physiology, all this kinda stuff. So that's to me what trance phenomenon is. It's evoking people's ability to alter their automatic experience without conscious deliberately control you. That's what it is. That's all we're talking about. And people can do this when they're in trance. If you get then in trance, they can shift the stuff that usually we can't shift. Now these are typically alterations in perception, sensation. You go from a warm to a cool sensation. Painful sensation to a tingling sensation. These are the kinda shifts that are, memory, you can have hyper amnesia where you remember something very vividly, you revivify it. Or you can have amnesia. Where you forget something. You've seen the classic stage of this who say, "I'm gonna have you count from one to ten, you're gonna forget the number four." And the person, when I click my fingers. One two three five six seven eight nine ten. Didn't you forget something? No, I got it. One through ten. I'll do it again. One two three five six seven eight nine ten. They have amnesia for something. That's a trance phenomenon. Time orientation, they can have time stretched out, time condensed as I mentioned. Spacial orientation. I don't know again if you've ever experienced this, some of my clients say, "I knew I was sitting in this chair, but I felt myself to be in some other part of the room." Or again if you wanna talk about natural everyday ones, when people are traumatized. I had a client who was abused and she would go into the picture on the wall and watch herself be abused. That's a spacial disorientation, if you will. She was in a different place experientially to where she knew her body actually was. And that happens in trance, can happen in trance. Or a person's sitting on a chair, you're doing hypnosis, and they're sitting on a chair and they know perfectly well they're sitting straight but when they come out of trance, intellectually they know, when they come out of trance, they'll tell you, "I thought my body was leaned over really weirdly, way far, and I thought I was gonna fall off the chair." And from the outside, they look like they're sitting up straight or maybe they're a little over to the left. So that's a spacial orientation shift. Physiology. Change. Blood chemistry. Brain chemistry. Body processes in some way. Muscles. That kinda stuff. So why use these trances? What are they for? What's the point? First, as I said, to evoke automatic changes, you really want to convince yourself and people, number one, that these are possible. Number two, you wanna start to get them to happen. So you're gonna evoke automatic changes. So they have an experience that convinces them they're in trance and convinces them that things can change that aren't under their conscious control. Alright? To evoke resources and abilities, and we'll get to this in a minute so I'll make this more explicit. And as an analogy for the therapeutic changes you're after. So let me tell you an example. When I was younger I studied with Dr. Erickson. And I had mentioned before I was molested. And partly how I was maneuvered into the molestation was with confusion. So I go to study with Dr. Erickson. It's a little challenging to deal with confusion because he majors in confusion. And that's partly how he does his work. But I got a sense of benevolence from Dr. Erickson. So I wasn't that worried about it. But it was troubling to me that I couldn't understand what the hell he was doing. I had read every paper he'd ever written. I was obsessed. Before I went to study with him. I had studied with Banner and Grinler who said they had him in a nutshell and as Erickson said later what they got was the nutshell. They got, they sort of got a husk of what he did. But he was doing stuff that was way more complex and interesting to me than what they had said. So I'd studied all his stuff before I went to study with Dr. Erickson. So after I went to study with Dr. Erickson, I became compelled to figure out what the heck he was doing and to make it sensible to me and then ultimately to other people. I wrote a book called "Tap Roots," trying to explain it. And he was hard to understand because almost every other theoretical approach to psychotherapy and hypnotherapy has kind of a formula to it. Like you got the Albert Ellis ABC formula. You know? This happens, then this belief and then the consequence and then you dispute it, and then you have a new experience. The ABCDE. Really that's the archetypal thing. And cognitive therapy dispute irrational thought. There are various ways of thinking about it. But they're almost always, Erickson didn't have such a thing. You could study with him and never find the formula. Partly because he did a different thing with everyone who came in. Even if they had the same problem, he would do a new intervention. So it's hard to find the pattern. There is a pattern, though, I want you to know. I assert that there's a pattern. I have written about these patterns, some of them. And other people in this conference will show you or tell you about these patterns. So one of the patterns, I'll just give you some examples. This is an example from the Ernie Rossy book, Erickson book that they jointly put together. And it's called "Hypnotherapy." And this older gentleman shows up in Erickson's office. He's seen Erickson in the past, as a patient. Shows up again and Ernie Ross is there to observe. And he says, "Here's my problem. My wife's been dead for over 20 years. I haven't had any relationships. I'm in my 70s. I just thought this was it for me. I was never gonna have another relationship. And I haven't had a sexual stirring in about 20 years. All of a sudden I'm dating this woman. And she looks like she wants to have sex and I'm just really worried. I haven't had an erection in a long time. I haven't had any sexual feelings in a long time. I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to respond or perform with this woman. And she seems really interested in it. So can you help me?" So Erickson says, "First thing is, did you realize that the receipts from Egyptian tombs has sprouted after 5,000 years?" 

01:58:00

01:58:05
BILL O'HANLON I hope you get the analogy. Here's what's more significant in terms of what we're speaking about today. He invites the guy into trance and then he does what seems like one of those traditional authoritarian hypnosis things. He says, "As you go into trance, you'll find that your body is just frozen to the chair, stuck to the chair. You won't be able to get up." Thank you. Whoever got the pun. A few more people are getting it. That's good. Slow, but it's trickling through the audience. So and he said, "Until I give you the signal." So the guy goes into trance. He goes, "Wow, this is amazing. I can't move my body." And he says, "Yeah, you're stuck to the chair." And he says, "Until I give the signal, as soon as I give the signal, you'll stand straight up, rigidly at attention. You won't be able to get back down until your unconscious is satisfied. That you've learned everything you need to learn to trust your body to respond appropriately in the appropriate situation. And Rossy, who's observing, reports that the guy blushes after a few minutes and sits back down. And then Erickson says, "And now, I wonder if you've noticed that your hand is lifting up. It's lifting up, lifting up, going up. Staying up. More and more. And it's heading towards the hair." And he's getting his hand levitation, trance phenomena. Another trance phenomena. And it won't go back down until it touches the hair. And it'll stay up there just long enough so that you can be confident of the ability of your body to respond in that sexual situation in the future. Stays up there for a little while and then back down to the thighs. Erickson brings him out of trance, sends him on his way. This is a treatment for sexual impotence or sexual lack of confidence. Then if the next guy came in, he would have a totally different treatment. So you think, what the heck is he on about? What is this about? Those are analogies for the kind of changes that he wants to evoke within the person's life. So I told you I was really obsessive. So Erickson dies in 1980. And I'm in practice by now and I start a private practice, which means I have a lot of time on my hands. And for a while, and I think, "Okay, I'm gonna use this time to really get even deeper into Erickson's work." And so I reread everything. Jay Haley's stuff and Ernie Rossy's stuff. And other people who've written about it, Jack Bears is here. And a few other people had written before 1980. This is the early days. And Bayley Ridner's stuff. And I watched the video tapes and I listened to the audio tapes and I just go over them again and again. It's just an obsession with me. And so I'm sitting in my house and I'm reading an interview that Jay Haley and John Weakland did with Dr. Erickson. They used to live in California and they were parts of the Bateson research project. And they got a grant to study communication. And one of the things they used with their grant money is to go and speak to Milton Erickson, because he had this really weird way of communicating that seemed to have an influence on people. So they went back and forth from California to Arizona once a month. They drove there. They brought a hunky old tape recorder, they plug it in, they'd ask Dr. Erickson the questions, he would answer, in his inimitable ways, in trance-like ways. And they would go into trance, listen or have regular conversations with him. And then they would turn off the tape recorder, they'd go back to California and they'd listen to the tape over and over again with their team, including Bateson and other people, and they would analyze what he did and then they would come up with a new set of questions because it was totally confusing when he was doing to them as well, partly because he was somewhat confusing. But partly because they were in that psycho-dynamic analytic frame of mind and Erickson was coming from an entirely different place. And so as Steven Gilligan said last night, they initially decided, he told people what to do and that's how he did it. But, this hypnosis stuff didn't exactly fit with that. They get this case in which Erickson tells them what he did. I'm gonna have to take this off to demonstrate this. But this is, he gets a guy who comes to see him, a new patient, and the patient is an anchorman for a news station in Phoenix. And the problem is he's doing, it's all panic attacks. And just before he goes on the air, he gets a panic attack and he can't go on the air so they have to put the weatherman in as the anchorman or whatever. And he's in danger of losing his job, because he's supposed to be there at the anchor desk every night doing the news. But he's got these panic attacks. So he goes to see Erickson, as psychiatrist, therapist. And Erickson tells him, who knows why he comes up with this idea and we'll talk about that in a little while. But he convinces him the problem is you have too much energy. So here's what you need to do. Right before you go on the air, when you're scheduled on the air, right before you go on the air, I want you to do 50 deep knee bends as quickly as you can to dissipate this energy and then you won't have panic attacks. The guy does it, and indeed he stops having panic attacks at work. He still has them occasionally at home, you know, and pretty soon his legs are tree trunks because he starts doing these, these deep knee bends and he gets a little tired of this. And so he comes back in in a subsequent session, he tells Erickson, still working but he's just in it a little because his legs are so getting so massive and he's getting tired of this. He decided to do something useful at home if he started to have a panic attack, he would go out in the backyard, and he would get a push mower and he would run through the backyard mowing the grass. Which dissipated the energy and therefore he wouldn't have the panic attack. So Haley and Weakland listen to this case example, they go back to California, they listen to it again and they come back and they have a question for Erickson. "Wasn't this guy showing you resistance because he didn't do what you told him to do?" Cause their idea is Erickson directed people what to do. And so if he didn't do what Erickson told him to do, he was resistant. And Erickson's perplexed. He said, "No." Because he doesn't have this idea. He says, "I thought it was wonderful that he adapted this idea to his own, in his own way. That's what I want my patients to do. As long as he did something that was in the class of exercising that was good enough for me." And they go back to puzzle over that another month. But 20 years later when I'm reading this, I have a moment of enlightenment. I just, I got what Erickson was doing. And I got why it was so hard to understand what Erickson was doing because he was working by analogy, I would say. And I got this model that since then which can be applied to trance phenomena, since then has helped me generate a new intervention for every client or patient that comes in with the same problem, I can generate a new intervention. Very easily. And I'm going to talk to you about this model and relate it to trance phenomena. Okay? So here we go. Let me go over this, we'll get back to this in just a minute. I just wanna you show this model because when we come back it'll make sense. So here it is. It's what I call the class of problems and class of solutions. Remember when Erickson said it was okay with me as long as he did something that was in the class of exercise. That's what triggered this. Cause I read, of course, and absorbed a lot of Erickson's cases and the problem was you couldn't find a good pattern because he didn't have one approach to anxiety, one approach to depression one approach to pain. He had multiple approaches and even with those multiple approaches, if a new person came in, he would find a different thing to do with them. So if you were trying to track the pattern from the presenting problem to the intervention, you could not find the pattern. Cause they seemed infinitely variable. But I discovered, if you tracked it at a different level, that is, here's the class of problems. And then here's the class of solutions and that led to the intervention, it made perfect sense. All of this, not all of this is interventions cause nothing, he didn't do everything systematically. But many of his interventions made sense after this. About 50 or 60 percent of his interventions totally fit with this model and then he did other stuff that just threw confusion into the mix. But it also gave me a model to be able to do these kinda generative interventions with trance phenomena, especially. But we'll get into that more specifically in a minute. So the next that happened is because I'd read all these cases about five cases of enuresis or bed wetting came to mind and I ran them through this model and they fit. Because I was always perplexed. Like, five different kids came in with bed wetting to him and he did five different interventions. So let me tell you these examples and find, this is gonna be your mid course exam, find out whether you can identify from these case examples, here's the presenting problem, it's always some variation on enuresis or bed wetting, lack of bladder control and people wet their pants or wet the bed. And it leads to different interventions but we're gonna look for the deeper structure, the similarities and the deeper structure, or the analogous structure. Alright, here's the first one. Some of you know these cases. First one is a 12 year old boy who's been wetting the bed since he got out of diapers basically. His mother's endlessly frustrated with him. She thinks it's sort of willful, he's not trying hard enough. So her response to this is to sort of shame him and blame him. She lectures him. She hangs his wet sheets so the neighbors can see them on the line outside. She gets him to stand up in church and ask for God to help him with this problem. So it's pretty shame based stuff. He's really angry at her because she's done all these shaming things and he's blaming her. And what can he do? He can't help it. And sometimes he thinks he's to blame and sometimes he doesn't. But he's really frustrated with mom. And they're locked in this battle. Dad stays out of it. He wet the bed till he was 17. He thinks it might be genetic but he doesn't wanna get in between these two. Alright. So they finally, out of frustration, cause they've been struggling with this for a while, come to see Erickson for help. And Erickson, here's the whole story, and he asks them, "Are you really really really motivated to get over this?" And they both agree they'll do anything. He says, "Okay. Mother," I'm gonna add one more piece. He finds out the kid is not doing well in school. As you might imagine he's in this emotional turmoil. But there's another issue and that is his handwriting is atrocious. Even in the classes that aren't about handwriting, he gets bad grades cause the teachers can't read what he's written. So Erickson says, "Okay, mother. What time's the family usually get up?" "Seven o'clock in the morning is the typical wake up time." "Alright. I want you to set your alarm for four or five in the morning, mother. And when it rings, I want you to go into your son's room and feel his bed. If the bed is dry, you go back to sleep. If the bed is wet, I want you to wake up your son, march him to the kitchen, get out one of his school textbooks, and have him practice handwriting until the normal wake-up time of the family." They said they were willing to do anything to get over this. Alright? "You can sit there and knit or sew whatever, but you have to supervise him. He makes a mistake, with his handwriting, you lean over and correct him. Get him to do it over again. He has to practice until he gets better at this." Within two weeks he stops wetting the bed. It's been years. Alright. Weird case. Haley called that ordeal therapy and it certainly is an ordeal. But I think there's something else operating here. Next one is Erickson has these friends that are both physicians and they have a four year old who's still wetting the bed. And they said, "We don't wanna put her in therapy but you have this magical way of working with people. Will you come over and just visit us informally and see if you can help her stop wetting the bed?" So he comes over and again you have to know a little about Erickson's history. He had polio when he was 17 and then he had a post-polio syndrome later, they thought it was another strain of polio. But he was partially paralyzed and he had muscle weakness along his right side a lot. And so he goes over to their house and he gazes at this little four year old and he challenges her to play a game of jacks. Most of you, I assume, know what jacks are. They're these little metal star-like things and you bounce a rubber ball and you pick up as many of them as you can on a turn and that's how you get your points. So of course she sees Erickson who's partially paralyzed and his muscles aren't very good and she figures "I can really win this game. That's pretty easy." But Erickson turns out to be very good at jacks. He's really good at it. And she's a little frustrated. Here she is, little kid and she's got a competitive streak. And at first he's just beating her at every game. But she is just determined she's gonna get better at this. And she starts to practice more and more when he's not there. And he comes over every week. Pretty soon she's beating him consistently in jacks. He says, "Okay. You got better at jacks. But you can't beat me on a bike." And she looks at his withered leg and she thinks, "Yeah, I can." So they get out the bikes and it turns again, Erickson has used his disability in a certain way, uses the heaviness of his atrophied leg and he can go like the wind. And she's like, "I can't believe it. This guy's a cripple and he's beating me." So she works and works and works and finally week after week she's beating him in the bike race. And the parents pull Erickson aside and say, "When are you gonna work on the bed wetting?" He says, "Be patient please." So after a couple months, she stops wetting the bed. They thought he was gonna come over and do hypnosis or something. He never did. He just played jacks with her and rode bikes. So that's the second example. Alright. Third example is another 12 year old who's wetting the bed, but this time he refers himself. He asks his parents to get him help. He's tried everything. The doctors tried to help him. Parents have tried to help him and he still wets the bed and he just doesn't wanna do it anymore. So they investigate. They know somebody who knows Erickson. He gets a referral. The parents call, tell him what the situation is, that he wants to come on his own, he's a very independent guy. He's very autonomous and he wants to go and seek treatment himself. So they'll pay for it but he's gonna come on his own. He's gonna ride his bike to the office. That's it. So he shows up at the office and Erickson's already talked to the parents and he's found out there's a rivalry, kind of sibling rivalry between the boy and his brother and maybe the parents are thinking maybe this is why he can't stop wetting the bed cause he's emotionally in turmoil. His brother picks on him a bit and things like that. So maybe that's it. So Erickson talks to him and he says, "I understand that you play baseball and your brother plays football." He says, "Yeah." He says, Erickson says to the boy, he said, "In my opinion, football is a sport for gross, uncoordinated muscles. You don't need much skill to win. All you have to do is be big and crash through the line and that's how you win in football. But baseball, the ball gets hit to you and if you're in the outfield you have to adjust your body underneath where you think the ball's gonna land and that requires a lot of muscle coordination. It's amazing." He said, "Then you open your glove, just at the right time and you clamp down on that ball when you catch it and then you transfer it to the other hand and you throw it and if you throw it and you let go of the ball too early, it doesn't go where you want it to go. If you let go of it too late, it doesn't go where you want it to go. If you let go of it just the right place on the arc, goes where you want it to go and that's successful baseball. That requires a lot of fine muscle control." Kid says, "Yeah. I agree. Baseball, great game. Football, gross uncoordinated muscles." He said, "Have you ever done archery with bow and arrows?" He said, "No, but I want a bow and arrow set for Christmas. I'm gonna ask my parents for that." He said, "Alright. Never know. You might get it. But here's the thing, you notch the arrow into the bow and you pull it back till you feel this tension, and then you have to aim at the target. What you don't know but I'm a doctor, so I know this, there's a little round muscle in your eye that's closing down to help you focus and opening up. It's doing that without you thinking about it. But it helps you focus on the target and the arrow, and your hand and the target, your arrow and your hand. The body's an amazing thing. I bet you don't even know how you digest your food." The kid says, "No, I don't." And he actually gets out one of his anatomy and physiology books and he shows him the intestine and colon. He says, "What happens is, the food comes down here and there's a little muscle that opens up here. And then the food goes in. And then a little muscle that pushes it along. There's a muscle down at the bottom of this long tube that clamps down just so your food stays in long enough for you to get all the vitamins and minerals and nutrition out of it and it moves along with little muscles pushing it along. And then when it gets to the end there's nothing left, you don't need anything more, it just opens up that muscle and gets rid of the stuff you don't want. If you tried to digest your food consciously, it would take you all of Saturday, you wouldn't be able to play or do anything else. Luckily your body does that for you." Kid goes home after Erickson was telling these stories, I'm sure in a trance like way, and he stops wetting the bed. Alright? Next example. Here's another one. 11 year old girl also seeks treatment on her own, asks her parents to find her somebody because she used to not wet the bed and wet her pants, but she's had a series of bladder infections and she's been catheterized with a sydoscoped(ph) so many times, she's lost control of her bladder muscle. So the kids at school find out, if they steal her books and run away from her, she can't run after them cause she leaks a little urine. He sisters know if they get her to giggle a lot, she'll leak a little urine. And they tease her a little and get her to laugh, cause they think it's kinda funny. And she's a little humiliated by this and she still wets the bed like a little baby. She doesn't like this. She goes to see Erickson. Erickson says, "I don't have to teach you anything because you already know how to stop wetting your bed and stop wetting your pants." She says, "No, I don't. That's why I'm here, for your help." And he says, "Yes, you do. You just don't know that you know." She says, "Yeah, you're right. I don't know that I know." So he says, "Okay. What would happen if you were sitting at home on the toilet, you were urinating. And your parents had a visitor, a person you never met, who came in and you'd forgotten to lock the toilet door. And he didn't realize it, and your parents didn't realize it and all of a sudden he poked his head in the toilet and there you were sitting on the toilet urinating." She said, "I'd freeze." He said, "What would you do?" She said, "I'd freeze." He said, "That's right. You'd freeze and you'd stop urinating. And then he would apologize and close the door and then after a little while you'd start urinating again. So what I want you to do is go home, sit on the toilet, start urinating and imagine that strange man popping his head in the toilet." And Erickson being a strange man himself was able to evoke this. And she would freeze right in the office, have an experience of that. And of course what was he getting her to do? What they call now kagel exercises, which is the exercise of that muscle. So all these have exactly the same, I could go on, there's a few more cases. But we just have a limited amount of time. Same presenting problem, which is bed wetting or enuresis. They get very different interventions, don't they? So again, hard to find the pattern here until you think what's the class of problems that these could all fit in and then therefore what's the class of solutions which is the fix for it. The opposite of whatever the class of problems is. What is it? Now, I'm gonna ask you this question and I want you to know I already know an answer, I hate when people do this in workshop. Ask a question, there's a right answer and they know it and you don't. But I want you to get the gears going in the brain a little. So you're gonna make some guesses and even though they may be good guesses, if they're not right I'm gonna tell you they're wrong until we get to the right one. Cause I want you to be thinking about this. Lack of fine muscle control. That's good. You got it on a first try. So I would say it's a little different from lack of fine muscle control, it's lack of automatic fine muscle control. But that's very close. And you're closer than most people get on first try. And that is, how do you, this is a question, how do you sleep through the night and not wet your bed? Those of you who don't wet your bed. I don't wanna make generalizations here. You develop that control. But it has to be automatic cause you're asleep. So there's two ways that people don't pee their bed, typically. One is they get a signal and they wake up and they stumble to the bathroom and go pee. And the other one is they sleep through the night and they develop automatic muscle control, fine muscle control, bladder control. So those of us who don't wet the bed have developed this ability. And maybe because Erickson was a physician or maybe because he made this observation. I don't think it's an accident that most kids stop wetting their bed about the time they learn to write. They learn to control, to be able to play games like jacks. So, what does Erickson do in all these interventions? He evokes or builds an ability to control muscles automatically. So you think about what does handwriting involve? Fine muscle control, and automatic. If you sign your signature, at this point, it's pretty automatic. But you had to practice it a lot to get there, to learn cursive or whatever. And you're playing jacks. What's involved? Fine muscle control. You're riding a bicycle. There's balance, there's getting the bike to go forward, moving your legs in coordination with moving your, there's a lot of muscle control involved in that. When you're playing baseball, when you're doing archery, when that muscle, that little muscle in your eyes, closing down and opening up, that's automatic fine, around muscle control you can get more specific there, which also I understand the bladder is a round muscle. So same class of problems, and what I do when I think in this way, we're gonna apply this to trance phenomenon, is I just think of, "Okay, what's the opposite of that?" Where does a person either have or potentially have automatic muscle control? So now let's apply this to trance phenomenon. If a person came in to see me for bed wetting, enuresis, wetting their pants, what would I do? What does hand levitation have to do with? Automatic muscle control. More specifically, in physiology. It's automatic muscle control. It's in the realm of physiology. Definitely. But it's automatic muscle control. So hand levitation could be an analogous treatment because it's an evocation of an ability. Remember what I said about evocation rather than suggestion rather than from now on you'll enjoy being a non-bed wetter more and more. Or you'll enjoy having dry beds a lot. That's the suggestive approach. The evocative approach is to evoke an ability or a resource that's beyond conscious control, if you're doing it in hypnosis, that's beyond conscious control or outside of conscious control that can solve this problem. So you know some of the Ericksonian stuff is vague, Ernie Rossy specializes in this, your hands won't go together until your unconscious finds the solution to this problem. That's a generic Ericksonian intervention. But Erickson was a lot more specific sometimes. Why was he talking about the hand touching the hair, get up and you won't be able to get back down again until your unconscious is satisfied. These are analogies that evoke experiential resources that evoke experiences, patterns of experience, what I would call the class of solution, from somewhere in their past. So if I were working with a person for pain control, I might talk to them about not noticing their glasses. Get how that might be relevant now? It's a class of solutions for pain control. There are 11 classes of solutions that I've identified for pain control but this is one of the classes of solutions. Somewhere in their experience, they have an experience of tuning things out when they're noxious stimuli. So I used to live in the Midwest and I had a holistic, a dentist there. One day I walked into her office and she said, "Do you smell a dentist's office smell in my office?" And I said, "Oh yeah." She said, "It's driving me crazy. I cannot smell it. And I wanna get rid of it because I don't wanna be like atypical dentist. But my patients can smell it but I can't." Well she's sitting in her office every day with the same smell and what happens is she tunes it out. So we know people have an ability to tune out noxious sensory stimuli. Now if you know that, and you put a person into trance and you are working on pain control, what common everyday experience can you think of that would be in the class of solutions, class of problems, class of solutions, noxious stimuli, and then tuned out noxious stimuli. Can be in any of the sensory realms. Can be in the smell, taste, touch, tactile, kinesthetic sense, visually, auditorally. Can you think of an everyday example that's when people tune things out. Yeah? Dogs barking. They're there all the time. You don't notice it. I for one, I had four kids, I'm flying planes all the time. Somebody next to me goes," Can you believe those kids screaming?" I say, "What?" I had four kids. I learned to turn my ears off. You don't survive as a parent without that. So dogs barking. Kids yelling. If you've never had kids, that drives you wacky some of you. People who live near trains. I have an example of that. Just when I got out of college I had very little money, undergraduate school, and I rented a little shack right next to the railroad tracks. It was cheap. Nobody else wanted to live there. And I was living there. And at first it bother me. The train would come rumbling through, all my dishes would rattle and it would be really loud as it goes by. And I'm living there for a year. And about nine months into the time I live there, I play music. And I was recording a song I'd just written on a little cassette. And I listen to the tape back and there's this train whistle going right through it. I had totally tuned it out. Cause I was so absorbed in the song and I learned to tune it out. So you can learn to tune that out. Hospital smells. Some of you work in a hospital. You don't smell that smell typically if you go there every day and spend a lot of time there. What else? Pet smells. Yeah. Other people walk in your house and it smells like wet dog or something. You don't notice it anymore. Yeah. What else? Losing your car keys at home. That's slightly different. If they're right in front of you and you don't see them, that's a little different. But I'm really talking about noxious stimuli. Something that would bother you but then you tune it out. Yeah? Living in a mill town. The stuff that spews out. Yeah. You don't notice it after a while. You've lived there all your life. You don't notice it. So we know that people have these abilities to tune things out. In trance, what makes the difference here, in trance we're gonna evoke that ability and amplify it. We're gonna put a magnifying glass on it, increase the intensity of it. That's trance phenomenon. And that's trance phenomenon for treatment. Right? We're gonna use it to help people solve their problems. So let's go back another slide. The last slide. Here. Sorry, we're going forward. So here's the question; how do you invite or evoke trance phenomenon? The first thing you do in this approach in the Ericksonian solution oriented approach, is get permission. I'll show you an example just in a minute. But Erickson's working with a woman in the 1950s, demonstrating trance. And they had to have these big hot lights because otherwise it's not gonna show up on the film. So they're in this small room and there's big bright hot lights. And Erickson turns to her, the first thing he says, "Are you forgetting about the lights?" She said, "Oh. Oh no. Should I?" He said, "No, but you can you know." That's permissive suggestion. You can you know. You can tune out anything that's not immediately relevant for you. That's just a generalized permissive suggestion. Your hand could lift up to your face at its own rate and its own pace without you lifting it consciously. That's a generalized permissive suggestion, if you wanna call it that, evocation, I'd prefer. It's just saying this could happen. Not this will happen or you must do this. That's the Zoran approach. That's right. And did you hear also what Erickson said when he said, "Are you forgetting about the lights?" There's an implication, a pre-supposition there. And he'll say, "I wonder which of your hands will lift up first?" Now that has multiple implications because that means both hands are gonna lift up, cause which hand. Sometimes when I sign books for people, and they'll tell me they have an interest in writing a book, I'll say, "I can't wait to read your first book." And they'll go away not thinking anything of that but then a couple of books later they'll come back and say, "I went back and read your inscription on the book that I bought of yours years and years ago and you said can't wait to read your first book. How did you know I was gonna write more than one?" That is an implication there. So Erickson will say, "I wonder which of your hands is gonna lift up first." A pre-supposition that the hand is gonna lift up, but also that both hands are gonna lift up. Right? So that's pre-supposing. Another one is to remind and evoke previous everyday experiences that are minor examples of trance phenomenon. Like the tuning out of the glasses. Okay? And then to use analogies and anecdotes. Did you know they found seeds from Egyptian tombs that sprouted after 5,000 years? That's just an analogy. Anecdotes are more story telling. You've heard about that in some of the presentations and obviously if you're interested in this Erickson stuff you've probably heard more about it outside this presentation. But storytelling became a really important part of my hypnotic and non-hypnotic work after I studied with Dr. Erickson. I didn't tell stories before that as a therapist. Emphasize words and phrases which Erickson called the interspersal technique. Maybe you're not sure that that hand could lift up. Or maybe you're not sure that you could go deeply into trance. So emphasizing certain words non-verbally with visual linkages or auditory linkages are more typical. And that becomes an evocation. I really don't know what you're gonna tune out. But I know that people can tune out parts of their experience. So I'm emphasizing certain phrases; tune out, tune out parts of their experience. Right? So applying that to this, what we're gonna do is think about any of these trance phenomena and what they might be useful for in treatment. But the first thing we're gonna do is learn to evoke them and learn to give people experiences with these things so we get more confident at bringing them forth. Some of you have never gotten a hand levitation. And that would be a challenging thing for you because it seems intimidating to you and you say, "Why bother? It seems like a tricky thing." Yeah, it may seem like a tricky thing to you. But if you've ever experienced a hand levitation, it's pretty powerful stuff. And I find it deepening my trance typically. Also it convinces me I'm in trance. And also, as I said before, it can be an analogy for treatment. It could be a treatment for impotence. And it could be a treatment for enuresis. Right? Yeah? Does the person when they get a hand levitation, does the person in trance feel the hand go up or do they think that it's down? Most of the time in my experience when I ask them, they report that they felt it going up but they didn't make it go up and that was fascinating and occasionally they didn't feel it go up, they're more dissociated than that. And occasionally it's sitting on their thigh and they experience it having gone up so they actually think it's up here but it's actually on their thigh. So it's all variations. So that's the thing. You know it's like when someone says, "What's trance like for me?" What is the definition of trance?" I say, "go into it a few times and you'll know that it's pretty hard to define. The experience of trance is different for different people. There are some commonalities. And it's the same thing. Most people in my experience tell me that they feel it lifting up and also here's what's weird, I don't know if you've ever noticed, those of you who do this, when I do hand levitation, people do this like spock thing with it. Their hand, their little finger goes out. Even when they've never seen anyone go in trance or get a hand levitation, a little finger goes out and also the hand stays very still. And it moves up in this step like fashion. Again, not 100 percent of the time. Just a lot. And I've always wondered why that little finger stays out there like that. I don't know why. Kabinsky reflex or something. I don't know what it is. But there is something weird about it. So there are some commonalities. And then I see people hold out their hands, stay like this when they lift up so they don't have that. But you'll find some commonalities and some variations. Alright? So in order to do this model for using trance phenomena for treatment, you have to find a clear focus or problem. It can't be this generalized depression or anxiety. Instead, think of anxiety, what's the part of anxiety you're gonna treat with hypnosis? Let's say it's the racing heart. That's the part you're gonna target with hypnosis initially. Well so what's the class of problems? Physiology. But a speeded up heart rate. What's the class of solutions? Slow down heart rate, it's the opposite. It's pretty easy once you get the class of problems, the class of solutions sort of jumps out at you, I think. It's just the opposite. But again, it's automatic speeding up of heart rate and automatic slowing down of heart rate. So what we're gonna do is evoke a slower heart rate in trance. Which we can do, it's one of the trance phenomena. And change people's heart rates. Alright? So you gotta find a clear focus of problem and then turn problems into processes. It can't just be depression, anxiety. It has to be how do they do depression or anxiety. Physiologically, neurologically, imaginally, memory wise. It's all those things that I said could change that the trance phenomena if you could get your hand on the control nob of experience. How does or would the person or body or neurology do this problem? If you were Meryl Streep, Robert Deniro in your next movie and you wanted to create a good anxiety attack, how would you do it if you used the method? You'd have racing thoughts, you'd race your heart, you'd make your palms sweaty. You'd really get into it and you could do this. So you wanna think of it in terms of a process and a doing. And what class of problems could it belong to and then what's the opposite class or set of resources or abilities, experiential learning as Erickson sometimes called them. Just patterns of experience that they have somewhere in their life that you could evoke. And then apply it to the problem at hand. Okay? So how do I do it? I tell stories, I guide associations, I remind people of previous experiences, I emphasize those words and phrases, I pre-suppose and create expectations. Let's give an example of this. I'll give you two examples of Erickson doing this many years apart but you'll see the commonalities. First one is that classic artistry of Milton Erickson tape that Herb Bluster got him to do it in a television studio with Mondy. Some of you have seen these, they're called Mondy tapes sometimes. And he's evoking a hand levitation with Mondy. Now listen, this is one of the trance phenomena, listen to how he does it and watch how he does it. Cause this is gonna be what we're gonna have you practice and learn here. Sorry. Here's Mondy. I have to change the volume on this too. So let me get up here before I do it. You know I'm not getting sound out of the computer. Why is that? Just a second. Gotta go back again. I'm just gonna have to hold this up here I guess. Okay. Here we go. This is a Mondy tape. He's gonna invite her to a, oh yeah.

02:41:10
BILL O'HANLON I hear the buzz. 

02:41:15
[sil.] 

02:41:25
BILL O'HANLON That's better. Alright. Let me see if I can get some other noise here. It's just coming out up here, it's not coming out through the line. 

02:41:40
[sil.] 

02:41:45
BILL O'HANLON Let's just look at the connections here. It's always the simplest thing to do. Stereo inputs. Slide. Speaker. 

02:42:00
[sil.] 

02:42:25
BILL O'HANLON You can hear that noise. It's perplexing to me. 

02:42:30
[sil.] 

02:42:40
BILL O'HANLON Now I can't hear it. I can hear it up here but I can't hear it there. So okay, let me see if the best I can do is just hold it above it and we'll see if that works. Alright, here we go. 

02:43:00
[sil.] 

02:43:20
UNKNOWN I wonder if you know which of your hands is gonna lift up to your face. Now you have that doubt. 

02:43:30
[sil.] 

02:43:55
UNKNOWN Now you know. It's pleasing to know. It's something like the feeling of touching your face. That feeling when once before your infancy you discovered your head belonged to you. It's a nice thing to learn. Now touch your face. Your unconscious is showing. A jerky movement. Because your unconscious has allowed your conscious mind to use fluid movement. And your unconscious doesn't listen. It's a reflex like way. And sooner or later I don't know just when, you're wondering about something that you would like to see. I don't know. You can open your eyes to see it. Maybe you'll see it with your eyes closed. It's something you haven't seen for a long time. It pleased you then. Which you've forgotten about. 

02:45:35
[sil.] 

02:45:40
BILL O'HANLON (inaudible ). And she's now, what that good feeling was. She was holding her dog. And that was before she went to school. 

02:46:05
[sil.] 

02:46:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

02:46:15
[sil.] 

02:46:20
UNKNOWN Go on and touch your face. And when it touches your face, you won't be able to keep your right hand in that position. You can't put it down now. Left hand has to touch your face first. 

02:46:40
[sil.] 

02:46:45
UNKNOWN Up it goes. You and I can be all alone here. 

02:46:55
[sil.] 

02:47:10
UNKNOWN ...don't want you to go into a trance just yet. But your unconscious mind is learning a great deal right now. Only you don't know just what it is learning. I'll tell you one of the things you're learning. And that is that your left hand is beginning to lift without your intention. And now your eyelids are showing difficulty in your face, smoothing out. While I've been talking elsewhere, you've been going deeper and deeper sleep. Now let's get that left hand up to your face. So that your right hand go down. Closer and closer. (inaudible ). That's right. Enjoy that. It can come to you as a surprise. Your right hand knows that you (inaudible ) is touched by your left hand. Closer and closer. 

02:48:45
[sil.] 

02:48:50
UNKNOWN And maybe you can do a bit of cheating. And you don't know what I mean. That's right. Everything (inaudible ). You don't know what I mean. But your unconscious does. You can't identify it for real. Now move your head so slight, downward to meet your hand. 

02:49:25
[sil.] 

02:49:30
UNKNOWN I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I wish and you probably will enjoy it more, right and now. How is it going to culminate? Your head is going to move down and touch your hand. Your hand is going to move up and touch your face. And you really don't know but you're gonna find out. 

02:49:55
BILL O'HANLON Okay. So let's let these guys work on this and see if they can sort it out. Let me go out of the program too and just check my sound settings, just to make sure we got it right. Okay. Let's do output. Let's get rid of the spoon thing. Let's get out of here. 

02:50:30
[sil.] 

02:50:40
BILL O'HANLON Sorry. Little technical behind the scenes here. It's not on. Let's turn it on. Maybe that'll help. 

02:50:50
[sil.] 

02:51:00
BILL O'HANLON Okay. Sorry. Let me get rid of this. Programs we can quit without messing me up here. And let's play. Still coming through. Sorry. Let me quit my keynote now. Start that up again too. For some reason... 

02:51:30
[sil.] 

02:51:50
BILL O'HANLON Okay we're gonna reboot the computer and then we'll be able to do it. So let me talk while that's doing that. And then we'll hook it up again. So I don't know how much you can hear that but you get the ideas of he's using permissive suggestion, the hand can lift up to the face. I don't know which hand will lift up first; pre-supposition. Then he starts to see the response and he encourages that response a little like Zoran Zoran. That's right. Hell do a little of that, that's right, that's right. It may do it now. Let's reboot it. So let's just try that out. Let's just try that. Let me plug it in and we'll start it again and see. This'll probably work. Okay. Oh yes. Good job. Thank you gentlemen, appreciate it. Our heroes. Okay. So let us launch this again and we will hear the second one. The second example and you'll hear some similarities in 1950s Erickson, he was a lot more directive. But 1950s Erickson to 1970s Erickson. So here's Erickson in, I'm sorry, the quality of the video is not as great. But you'll see a similar kind of thing. Cause this what I want you to imprint on when you're doing trance phenomena. You're gonna have to evoke them. Invite people to experience these things and you can't be like wimpy with this, you gotta go for it. And so listen to how Erickson goes for it. And what I love about Erickson is he doesn't get it. That's always good for those of us who are students, to see he didn't get it. But he persists until he finds a way to get her to experience this. Alright, so here we go. 

02:54:00
UNKNOWN  Are you forgetting about the light? 

02:54:05
UNKNOWN No, I'm not. 

02:54:05
UNKNOWN  You can forget about it, you know. And I'm going to take a hold of your hand in a moment or so. 

02:54:25
[sil.] 

02:54:30
UNKNOWN Now as you watch your hands, they're resting there. And do you know about the feelings you'll have when you're feeding a baby, you want the baby to open its mouth. And you open yours for the baby. And did you ever put on the brakes when you were in the backseat of the car? 

02:54:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:54:55
UNKNOWN  Well I would like the same kind of an automatic movement. Very very slowly without it being a voluntary movement, my right hand can lift and it can lower and the left hand can lift and lower. Now what I'd like to have you understand is this; that you have a conscious mind. You know that. And I know that. And you have an unconscious mind, or a subconscious mind. And you know what I mean by that, do you now? Now you could lift your right hand or your left hand consciously. But your unconscious mind can lift one or the other of your hands. And I'd like to look at your hands. And I'm going to ask you a question and you do not know the answer to that question consciously and you'll have to wait and see what the answer is. I'm going to ask you which hand is your unconscious mind going to lift up first. The right or the left? And you really don't know. But your unconscious knows. That's right. And it's beginning to lift one of your hands, lifting, lifting, lifting, lifting up. Watch it, that's right. Watch it lifting, lifting, lifting up. Watch it. Soon you'll notice it. And keep watching your hand and watching. And if you wish to close your eyes, and just feel your hand lifting higher and higher. That's right. Lifting still more. That's right. Elbow will start bending and the hand will come up. That's right. Lifting. 

02:57:50
BILL O'HANLON See how directive that is? It's really directive and it's not working. 

02:57:50
UNKNOWN And now close your eyes and just feel it lifting. And it's lifting higher and higher. And I'm going to take hold of this hand. 

02:58:00
BILL O'HANLON He lifts it. 

02:58:00
UNKNOWN  Lifting lifting lifting. That's right. 

02:58:15
[sil.] 

02:58:20
UNKNOWN And the other hand is lifting, lifting up. 

02:58:25
BILL O'HANLON Now she can resist by having one go down and one go up. That was Erickson's skill. Persistence. 

02:58:35
UNKNOWN Now I mentioned it before. The hand could lift and it could go down. But now I wonder if you know which hand is going to go down first. One or the other is going to go down first. Down, down. That's right. That's right. Down down down. 

02:59:00
BILL O'HANLON He's getting that automatic movement. 

02:59:00
UNKNOWN And coming down still more. Still more. 

02:59:05
BILL O'HANLON That's all he's looking for, is automatic movement. Doesn't matter whether it goes up or down. He wants to evoke automatic movement. And as it comes down, I want you to go deeper and deeper into the trance. I'd like to have you enjoy going deeper and deeper. And when your hand reaches your lap, take a deep breath and go even deeper into the trance as you're beginning to learn how. That's right. Coming to rest there. That's right. Now take a deep breath and go way deep to sleep. Now it may seem to you as if many minutes had passed. And I'd like you slowly to arouse, look at me and talk to me. And slowly rouse up now. Slowly rouse up now. Now open your eyes. That's right. And you're beginning to learn to go into a trance. Do you realize? 

03:00:25
UNKNOWN  I think so. 

03:00:30
UNKNOWN You think so? And how does your hand feel? 

03:00:30
UNKNOWN  A little heavy. 

03:00:35
UNKNOWN A little heavy? And can you see your hand? 

03:00:40
BILL O'HANLON  Alright. We can stop after a while. But he's a little more Zoran in that one. But that's right. The hand will lift up. And it's lifting, lifting, lifting. It's not lifting, lifting. So I love to see that. It empowers me because Erickson's so good at what he did generally. But again, he found creative ways to do it. So, what we're gonna do here, because it's so simple to see from the outside, and it's a good one to practice, we're gonna get you to practice going for evoking hand levitation. Now this strikes fear into the hearts of some of you are fine with that, I'm sure. Let me tell you a story. A number of years ago, it was in the 80s sometime when I was first teaching Erickson's approach to hypnosis in a mental health center in West Virginia, a mental health center invited me to come for three days. And they, when I arrived there they told me they'd all pooled their individual training budgets that they'd gotten, they used to have these in the 80s, for those of you who are younger, they used to pay for therapists' training in mental health centers. And so they pooled all their individual moneys to hire me for three days to come out there. This was their training budget for the year. A little pressure, you know. So they really wanted to learn hypnosis. So a couple people had come to a workshop I'd done, and they wanna bring it back to their folks. So they thought it'd be helpful for their folks in the mental health clinics. So I was feeling a little pressure. So I said to him, "Okay, you spent all your money on flying me out here and getting me to be here, and I want you then, on your side, to make a real commitment. You're gonna go for it." You know Dr. Erickson used to say, "If you fall on your face, at least you're heading in the right direction." So what I'd like you to do is during this exercise I would like you to be willing to be awkward, feel foolish, not know what you're doing and fall on your face a great deal. And I don't know another way to learn something new, if this isn't usual for you. And we're gonna make this, I think, kinda a fun exercise. I'm gonna have you go for hand levitation to evoke this experience, and I'll give you some guidelines here. We're gonna do an exercise that's a variation on something that I learned from Steve Gilligan some years ago. It's called mutual trance induction. That is, we're gonna have two of you pair off, if you're willing, and one person's gonna talk and say a few hypnotic things like you can just sit there, breathing, sitting in the chair, being exactly where you are and it's okay to be where you are. And you can begin to go into trance. And then you're gonna pass the baton to the other person and they're gonna hypnotize you. If you were the speaker, you'll now be the listener. You're gonna do a mutual trance induction and one of the things that you're gonna go for, both of you, both parties in this pair, are gonna go for evoking hand levitation. So if you don't get it, you don't get it, it's okay. They'll know you're just practicing. It's not your whole reputation and self esteem isn't on the line. You're just going for it. Like those people in Blueridge mental health center. So that's what I want you to do. And when, you'll know when it's time to pass the baton back and forth, is to say, this is the cue for them to talk after you've talked and say, "And you're amazing." Look them deeply in the eyes and say, "And you're amazing." So even if they don't believe it or they have a negative reaction to it, just say that and that'll be the cue it's time for you to talk. Then they'll talk and when it's time for you to talk again, they'll say to you, "And you're amazing." Alright. That's typical Gilligan to me. So what you're gonna do is use these methods to evoke, and you can look up here at the cheat sheet while you're doing this, if you want. Remind them of every day experiences of automatic hand or muscle or arm movement. Maybe they wanted to raise their hand in class. Or maybe they threw the bowling ball and they really want it to go a different place and they're moving their hand as the bowling ball's going down the thing. Maybe they're doodling while they're talking on the phone or taking notes or whatever it may be. Automatic, non-voluntary, non-conscious, hand and arm muscle movements in everyday life. Where do you find those? Think about that and include some of those. So Erickson said, you remember what he said? Do you know, have you ever been in the backseat of a car and put your foot on the brake? That's that. And do you know the feeling that you're trying to get a baby to open its mouth when you're feeding it and you open your mouth? Those are those common everyday examples. Use analogies, anecdotes and stories. Use general permissive statements. Use pre-supposition, which hand will lift up first, how quickly will it lift up, will you notice whether it's lifting up. Those kinds of pre-suppositional things. You shoulda learned those in some of your other sessions here. And once you see your response amplified and directed and then link it to something more. As that hand lifts up, you can go deeper into trance. You can trust yourself more and more to be able to listen to hand levitation with me. Whatever you wanna link it to. Right? Okay? So that is your task. Do mutual trance induction, I'll give you about 22 minutes for this. And then we'll have a few minutes of discussion before we end. And again, the instruction is go for trance, go for hand levitation, and be like a Buddhist, don't get attached to it if it doesn't happen. And go for it. Okay? You can do that now. Okay. Please put your attention back to the main group. I know some of you are just having some feedback. Just for time purposes, if you put your attention back here, that'd be great. That was one minute. Yeah, that's about 20, 22 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Almost exactly. Yeah. Okay. So let me just take a quick survey to bring us back to the group here. How many people evoked in their partner hand levitation? Okay. How many people got hand levitation evoked? How many people can do psycho-kinesis, raise my hand? I always like to check on a crowd like this. Alright. So a lot of you went for it. A lot of you got it. And I'm sure you learned a little something from that. Now this is only one of the trance phenomena. There are many many trance phenomena. It's distortions in memory, perceptions, sensations, time, muscles, physiology. And your task, and this is what Erickson did, he just played around with these things. People think Erickson was this intuitive genius who just sprung from the head of Zeus. If you read his work, he would practice on thousands of people, evoking these things and finding out. And here's the weird thing, if you know a lot about Erickson's work, I was just teaching in a previous thing about brain plasticity, Erickson knew about neuro-plasticity long before the rest of us knew. He, one of the things I think made Erickson such a hopeful therapist, is he was a pretty optimistic guy and that effected me and a bunch of his students, is that he believed people can change. We've learned mostly as physicians and psychotherapists, to diagnose what's not changing about people typically. And so we're focused on the kind of fixed nature of people. But recent research in neuro-science has shown there's a neuro-plasticity, a brain-plasticity that's involved. I think Erickson thought there was a perceptual plasticity, an emotive plasticity, a cognitive plasticity, a behavioral plasticity, an inter-personal plasticity, and perceptual, sensation plasticity. He just saw plasticity possibilities everywhere. And so he would just enter in where he thought the changes were possible and one of the places is through non-conscious automatic trance-like changes. And these are the trance phenomena. So what I suggest you do, like Erickson, is you devote yourself, when you're doing trance practice or doing trance work with people, in your clinical setting, is really go for these different trance phenomena. Time distortion, physiological changes, warmth where there was coolness, coolness where there was warmth. Tingling where there was pain. Just start to experiment with these things and then there's two kind of things that happen. One is people get the meta-message; change can happen. I was telling this story the other day; this guy comes in to see me and he has peripheral neuropathy, feet that really hurt and they can't figure out the medical reasons and they certainly can't sort it out medically. So he comes to see me. And he tells me this is a problem in a couple ways in that not only is he in pain, this kind of intrusive pain that happens, he said, "It happens every night at nine o'clock and it interferes with my sleep. I try to go to sleep early, like at eight 30 and kinda trick it so that I'd be asleep when it came on. And then at nine o'clock it wakes me up." So we do some hypnotic work. And he comes back a couple weeks later and I say, "So, what's happening?" And he said, "Well nothing's changed." I go, "Okay, so you're still having trouble sleeping because the pain's getting in the way and it comes on at nine o'clock every night." He said, "Oh no no no. I'm sleeping fine. But it happens at nine o'clock every morning." And I was like, I was so excited about that, I thought, "Good." He's had this very persistent pain at nine o'clock every night, it's interfering with his sleep, which certainly interferes with his well-being and functioning. And now he's having it at nine o'clock in the morning. He thinks that's no change cause he still has the pain. Me, I think ah. Neuro-plasticity. Perceptual plasticity. Time plasticity. Scheduling plasticity. I'm just looking for change first. And that's part of what these trance phenomena may be. They may be just kinda loosening the jar of change. The people can tell when they're in trance. Something different is happening from my usual experience, my usual suffering, my usual pain, my usual depression, my usual anxiety. Whatever it is they're coming with, and then you give them an experience, and this is the key thing, an experience of something changing. And then of course you have to direct the change in a way that ultimately we wanna get rid of the neuropathy, the pain part of it. We really wanted to help him diminish and decrease that. But first as long as something's changing automatically, non-consciously, I'm very encouraged by the prospects of hypno-therapy and doing this stuff. And so just practice evoking this with your clients, with your patients. That's gonna be the key to being able to have the confidence then to figure out and select among the potential neurological, perceptual, sensory, memory, physiological, emotive, cognitive changes that could happen when somebody arrives with some fixed problem that's not changing very much. If you can give an experience in one of these trance phenomena, and then ultimately figure out which one might be the best one to treat it, that will be the treatment. Then again, when I said when I first went for hypnosis training, they spent so much time on induction. Induction is an important thing, you better invite a person into one of these altered states but then it's like what the heck do I do when I get there? That's a 64,000 dollar question ultimately. Whether you're a dentist, or a physician, or you're a psychotherapist, you wanna help people change. And you wanna help them change in a certain direction. And so that's what I got excited about, learning the trance phenomena. And it also, years ago, I was on a committee and one of these Erickson conferences to decide whose presentation, which presentation got made. And I think Norm Katz or somebody delivered a little abstract that said, "Living hypnotically." Well it's also changed my everyday life because I realized when things are happening with me, they're not set in stone. I can use these same abilities for neuro-plasticity, perceptual plasticity to change my own experience. And that, again, should make you an optimistic therapist because the way we think about people is a lot in that diagnostic fixed way. And the way Erickson thought about people was a lot in the change plasticity sort of way. So as part of this hypnotic track that some of you have been on for a while and some of you just dropped in on, this is a core piece. You need to learn induction, you need to learn how to evoke and work with trance phenomena, and then to me the last thing, if we're gonna put this in the 30,000 foot birds eye view, you need to learn how to evoke and channel certain trance phenomena or experiential changes to treat the problem. If you can master those three things, that's the hypnotherapy process for me. Now you can do more general things as I said, because that's the nice part about hypnosis, you can just tell people go inside, find the resources you need and make the changes you need. With that vague language, some people will change in the right direction. And some people won't, in my experience. It's not sufficient for some people. So that's why you wanna learn these trance phenomena, learn to evoke them, learn the methods for evoking them, recognizing when they come. Some of them you can only tell when people come out of trance. They'll say, "I saw these waves of green and purple going through me." Or they say, "How long was that in clock time?" And you'll say, "It was 22 minutes." And they say, "Wow. It felt like five or it felt like 50." Or whatever it may be. They'll tell you about the plastic changes that have happened. The nice part about the hand levitation is you can see it while it's happening. Some of the rest of them you can't see. They can only report them to you. So this is a good one to practice with. Because you can tell what you're saying is having an effect or not. Are children what? Are children more easy to get hand levitation or do trance phenomena on? Not particularly. No. I haven't found it to be so. And I don't specialize on working with children but no. I think different people are more easy and some people just get involved a little better. Some people are just virtuoso trance subjects to start with. But here's what I would say; almost everyone I worked with gets better at this stuff. Once they get more of it evoked and once they get more experience. When I first went into trance, I wasn't very good at much of it. And now I've got round heels for trance. I can go into trance in seconds, when it used to take me minutes or longer. And I've got double hand levitation. I get time distortion longer. I get really big changes. But I've had a lot of experience. And again, maybe that's part of that neuro-plasticity. Whatever you do more of, you get more skilled with typically. So practice this with your clients and patients, especially if you have people you don't really quite have the solution yet. Just have them play in trance with their internal experience. It's almost infinitely changeable. It's not infinitely changeable. It's very close, as Steven Gilligan was saying. There's this feel of almost infinite possibilities. And that's what we're playing with with trance phenomena. Okay? So, given that, we have just about five more minutes. Any questions or comments before we end things that I didn't cover or didn't make clear to you, you'd like to ask or say? Yeah, thank you. You're modeling well, going to the mike. 

03:17:15
UNKNOWN The comment I want to make is even though my partner and I did not evoke hand levitation, we had tremendous time distortion. For us, it was five minutes. That's why I asked you if it was 20 minutes. Because it seemed, you said just five minutes left. It was like we'd been at this for two minutes. That kind of experience. 

03:17:35
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. So you're resistant and didn't, okay, I understand. And that's what happens. You invite people into trance and it's not precisely under your control. You can have some influence on it. But it isn't under your control and that's the nice part for me is I just give it up and I say, "I'm going for any automatic change, whatever it is." And I figure you know best what the right change is for you. I don't know best. I'm gonna invite and suggest but it's always with an RSVP. So I appreciate that. Yeah? 

03:18:05
UNKNOWN Question about what you think about something. You probably know Joe Barber. 

03:18:10
BILL O'HANLON I know Joe Barber. 

03:18:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. He says that what he does or at least when I last knew him, was that he would just simply reach over, lift somebody's hand, and then he began the trance work. What do you think of that? 

03:18:25
BILL O'HANLON Erickson did that occasionally. I think these days in America it's so easy to get sued touching people that I would generally avoid it. Like I learned that tapping thing and I just show people, "This is what you do with yourself." I'm not gonna be touching. I'm not touching. The lawyers have really cured me of that. But so that's one thing. And the second thing is I think that's one way to do it. Joe's a little more directive as was Erickson, than I am. I'm a lot less directive. And I just wanna evoke. I don't wanna do. It's the same thing about, you can do things for your patients. You can give them the answer or you can evoke it. And I tend to be more towards the evocation. But as you saw with Erickson, it works. 

03:19:15
UNKNOWN  I guess this comes from my own experiences on being hypnotized is that the permissive part and the sense of security and the sense of ownership for the person going into trance is really the most important thing. And I could so easily identify why it was more difficult for Erickson when he was younger, and he was kinda creepy with this and you will... you know. 

03:19:40
BILL O'HANLON Why shouldn't I tell you what to do? A little more power hungry and directive and needing to prove that he can make them do things. And I think by the time I knew him, he was that benevolent, grandfather who'd already proved his power. And he didn't need to show it anymore because he could just be gentle and evocative. And I have a resistance to that approach, the Zoran Zoran you will, your hand is lifting up more and more, lifting, lifting, lifting. And I'm like or not. So I think you get so many more people in trance with that permissive way. Once they go into trance, though, I think you can be a lot more direct cause you already got that connection and they're willing. They've said, "You can lead me. I give you permission in a certain way." Yeah. 

03:20:25
UNKNOWN Bill, you talked about that class of problems and class of solutions. I think you mentioned you had identified 11 kind of patterns, 

03:20:35
BILL O'HANLON Strategies. 

03:20:35
UNKNOWN Right. Do you have that written down? Did I miss it? 

03:20:35
BILL O'HANLON Yeah it's in solution oriented hypnosis, one of my books. It's I think it's in a guide to trance. But let me see if I can remember it. Dissociation. It's a good one. Time distortion. Where you increase the time where they feel comfortable, decrease the time where they feel discomfort. Connection to a compelling future without pain. I wonder if I see you, when I see you a year from now, tell me how you've lost your pain, you're more comfortable or whatever. Let's see, analgesia, anesthesia. Those are two different things. Anesthesia being the lack of sensation. Analgesia being the lack of pain. So hypnotically induced analgesia, anesthesia. Reinterpretation of the pain. I probably got eight or something. I don't know if I can recall them all. But there's a list in one of my books. And maybe in the handouts, I'm not sure. Maybe in the handouts. What? The name of the book. There's a couple books I've written on trance. One of them is "Solution Oriented Hypnosis." And the other one is called, "A Guide to Trance Land." A little dog on the front, as you may see. And so I think they were in the bookstore but you can get them from Norton publishes both of them and you can get em from Amazon or whatever it may be. I've written three books, I think, on trance. Those two and then tap roots, which is on trance and non-hypnotic stuff of Erickson's work. And uncommon case book which is now an E book and Jeff is gonna reissue it as a printed book too as part of this Erickson collected papers thing. So yeah, but again think of how people usually change their pain. How did anybody ever get over pain non-medically? And think of all those resources that people have within them. Distraction is another one. Displacement of pain. There's two more. I think we're up to ten now. Almost to 11. Displacement of pain. You ever see that, Erickson tell that story and he says to the woman who's in cancer pain and she's dying and he says, "If a hungry tiger walked into your hospital room licking its lips, looking at you, how much pain do you think you'd feel?" She said, "None." And he said, "That's right. You can just keep that hungry tiger with you at all times." And she takes the hungry tiger home with her from the hospital and lives pain free till she dies. It's like that's distraction or reorientation of attention. And I usually do these things with analogies and stories cause that's my preferred method. Along with avocation and trance phenomena. So that's how you do it. Alright. Thank you for being here. It's time for lunch. Thank you. Thank you. That's nice of you.

Betty Alice Erickson, MS, LPC, LMFT 

03:23:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. And what my plan is is my plan is to give you some information about why I personally and you love metaphors and stories and how easy and effective they are, how wonderful they are. And some facts about what I believe, okay, and that brings me to the wonderful suggestion, thank you, if you can't hear me, cause I'm talking normal talk now, and my voice drops when I go into a trance, and if you can't hear me, please bring it to my attention. There's nothing worse than sitting in a program and seeing, and not having a clue. And I don't wanna do that. So excellent and thank you. Okay. So first about stories. Then about what I believe is the most effective way to tell them. Then I have a demonstration. And then we'll have an exercise since this is a workshop. Okay? Okay. So you can't be an Ericksonian, that's all in quotes, if you don't know how to tell stories. Because that's what Dad was absolutely legendary for. And there's whole books written about it. And the reason he told stories so much is because they are so absolutely effective. So I'm gonna give you just a little outline. Stories; they create a naturalistic conversational trance. If I wanna communicate with you, a trance is a way that you're gonna hear me. You will hear so much more in a trance. And in fact, one of the definitions of hypnosis includes it is the highest order of communication, because it is. It has all, a conversational trance has all the phenomena of a formal trance and it's so much easier and so much better for so many reasons. And when you're in a trance, your unconscious hears. It hears. May decide not to do anything, that's perfectly fine. Once you hear, you cannot unhear. You have the knowledge for sooner or later. Stories also normalize. It's really nice to hear somebody with a problem about somebody with a problem similar to yours, who actually might have a solution that you can pick up and use. It teaches indirectly. I don't have to tell you anything. I just tell you a story. Think of Aesop's fables. Think of parables from the Bible. Think of stories. They all teach indirectly. And any time you're indirect, you are avoiding a whole lot of resistance, what is called resistance. Because it's just a story. One of the things that's often overlooked, is it teaches, it gives independence. Because if I just tell you a story, and you draw a wonderful conclusion for it, who did it? You did it. I'm not even the vehicle. You are independent. And a hallmark of Ericksonian psychotherapy is you are autonomous and independent because independence is the primary joy of life. They're also fun. It's nice to tell stories. A lot of stories create laughter. And laughter and curiosity are way up here in the feelings. If you have a feeling that you don't like and you're laughing or curious, that uncomfortable feeling cannot continue to exist, because it's overcome by laughter and curiosity. Which are wonderful happy emotions. Now, when you tell stories, you don't just stand up here and ramble or sit in an office and ramble. You have to have a purpose. Otherwise you're just chit chatting. Once in a while chit chat is great. But most of the time you have to have a purpose. What's your goal? Why are you telling this? In the rare occasions when somebody asks you why are you telling me this, you can say what Daddy once answered, "Cause I think it's a good story." But nobody asks. Particularly if you have a reason. What do you wanna teach? What paradigm shift do you want to occur? What broadening do you want to give your listener? Ericksonian psychotherapists, we don't take away things from you. We expand perspectives. Because when you have an expanded perspective, you are gonna do what's right for you. Sooner or later. Our difficulty is in remembering that it's your time-frame, not my time-frame. And that's the hard part. But to know that we're just expanding, that's relatively easy. People wonder how to make up stories. Well there's two parts to it. One part, which I will be teaching and demonstrating and have an exercise for, is to be in a trance. If I am in a trance and I am focused on you and I am offering and inviting you to join me, it's almost irresistible. And straight from Erickson's lips, there's two necessary things to create a trance; formal or informal. One is that I'm in a trance. And the second one is an air of delighted expectation. Of course you're gonna join me. Why wouldn't you? It's such a neat place to be. Okay? So that's one thing that you have to, and that's practice, a lot of that is practice. Then there's some broad goals. Now you all, everyone in this room, has been alive long enough so you have a huge repository, gigantic resource of stories within you. Cause you've been alive more than six months. When you are in a trance, remember one of the definitions of a trance is you can access unconscious resources and bypass conscious defenses. So when you're in a trance, that applies to you too. You can access all the resources you have which are so many that you can create stories as you're talking to the client. But there's some broad goals. And you need, in my opinion, to have a repertoire of stories for particular goals. Common ordinary goals. Triumph and conquering. If I talked to you about remember when you first learned to ride your bicycle and you had to pedal and steer and balance all at that same time? At one magic moment you did it. And the wind in your face and you could do it. Now that's a story of triumph and those of you who are looking at me and remembered it and felt it, you felt that moment of triumph. People forget to remember to feel good emotions. That one you can take to the bank. If I ask the average client, "Tell me five things about school," chances are every one of them is gonna be, "Well I got good grades," and the rest are, "I didn't get chosen once for the team and I had a mean teacher and spelling was always hard for me and I lost the election for student council in second grade." People don't have practice in remembering wonderful emotions. And that's way to shift a paradigm indirectly inside you is every trance you induce, every story you tell, no matter what the goal of the story is, should also have some of that thrown within. Okay. Fearlessness and courage. Oh my goodness. When you were little, you were so courageous. I bet your mom had to tell you, "Don't you dare run across that street. You wait for Mama to hold your hand. And you better not leave me in the store. You better hold my hand." Flipped. That's really a courageous child. The normal natural state of human beings, again, right from Dad's works, are just like that of a four or five year old child. Happy, enthusiastic, fearless, curious, loving, giving, sharing. All those things that we overcivilize out of children. We have to learn to wait our turn. We have to learn that we can't reach across the table and grab the drumstick from the turkey. We can't do that. We have to say yes and no even when we don't want to. And please and thank you. But if you lose touch of that wonderful, happy, enthusiastic, friendly, cheerful, fearless child inside you, you're gonna lose touch with a big source of happiness for you from you. So part of stories are to help you reconnect. Part of trances are to help you reconnect. Another one is contentment. Remember when you were little and you could sit in front of the TV or the radio and all was well with the world? And there was snow or rain on the roof. But all was well. That's contentment. We forget to remember that. And now, expansion of habits. Seeing other people's problems and solutions. And the solution of your own problems. Okay. Now. In story construction, it's really good to have specific generalities. Specific generalities are the non-important details but very specific. The important details are very general. For example, if I were to tell you that years ago I had this wonderful wonderful dog. And my dog and me and I were good friends. And I liked to lie on the floor and watch television and my dog would lie there with me. And he'd have his nose right here and I could see big brown eyes and see his tail just a-wagging away. And those eyes looking at me with adoration while I watched television. And sometimes I'd have a plate of Oreo cookies on my stomach. And then I would really see adoration. I still miss my friend. Now when I tell this story, what I'm really modeling among other things, is first of all the specific generalities; Oreo cookies. That's very specific. Lie on the floor, the nose here, big brown eyes, that's very general but it's very specific. Most dogs have big brown eyes. And the tail wagging. Didn't say long, didn't say short. A tail wagging. If I, I didn't even say the sex of the dog. I called him my friend. Let alone the species. Now if I had said I had this wonderful Springer Spaniel with long ears and curly hair in his ears and freckles on his little muzzle, then I'm talking about my dog. And you can't fill in the blanks and really remember to remember your dog because I've made it too specific. And in the end of the story, I say, "I still miss my friend." Which is saying indirectly without the words, of course my dog is dead. And once upon a time when he died, I couldn't even talk about him. That's a very well known symbol of grief. When your dog dies, you can't talk about it at first. You go, "My dog died," and everybody says, "I am so sorry." And then you say, "My dog died," and you're able to talk about it. "I really miss him." People say, "I'm so sorry." "Yeah, I really miss him. I expect him to be there." And then after a while, you're able to tell funny stories about him. Chewed up all my shoes. Would pretend he was watching television with me but he's really looking out for the Oreo cookies. And that's how you say without saying, life really does go on. Now, because it really does. You cannot ever predict what somebody is gonna be doing with a story. You tell a story and you may have this goal in mind. And your client can pick it up, turn it around, or not turn it around, and use it for something completely different. And that is a piece of faith that you have to leap over, past and through, because when we tell a story, by golly I want you to get the meaning I have in the story. Now I learned on the deepest level possible you can't predict that and you better just trust. When that, Erickson said, "Trust your unconscious," my perspective is that he was saying and I heard him say, "Trust the unconscious." I have to trust you're gonna take whatever I say and do it. Trust my unconscious, trust your unconscious, trust the universe's. Not just my unconscious. Several years ago I got a phone call. And the man said, "Betty, I'm a psychologist in San Antonio. And I wanna tell you something. And I do not want you to speak." And I said, "Okay." And he said, "I was in a workshop you gave about four years ago. You told a story. I had PTSD. And you told this story and I was back in Vietnam." And I said, "Oh my gosh." And he said, "Be quiet and listen to me. Took all my courage to call you. Now you just listen." I said, "Okay." He said, "When you told this story, I'm back there. I'm hearing bombs. I'm smelling it. And I thought, what can I do? So I stood up, I waved my hand and I asked a question, cause I thought that's gonna ground me. And you called on me, I asked my question, you answered the question, and I sat down and it was worse. So I sat there for a minute and I thought I can't do this. So I went in the restroom, and I went into a stall. And I sat on the toilet and I cried and I cried and I cried and I cried." And I'm wanting so much to say something. And he says, "And you know what?" I said, "What?" He said, "I've never had a flashback since. You cured me." And I said, "Oh my god. What was the story?" And he said, "I don't remember." Great. And he said, "It was something about a pet that died." And I said, "Oh, I know that story. Thank you very much." And he said, "Okay, thank you. Mission completed. Bye." Never heard from him again. Don't need to. The story is this. Now I crafted this story deliberately because I had an engineer and I've heard other people at this workshop say, you know engineers, they're all up here. And he was all up here and he said, "I don't have emotions Betty. I just don't have emotions. So there." And I'm thinking, "Yeah you do." So I thought alright I gotta invent a story that's gonna make him feel. Not feel happy, cause he had a great sense of humor. So I told him a story about once upon a time, which is an induction in itself, once upon a time a long time ago. And you're waiting for a story aren't you? So once upon a time, my son, who was five years old, had this wonderful Guinea pig. And we loved this Guinea pig. Loved him. And when we got him, I like to do this with a big audience, when we got him, we told the children who were six, five and four, we said, "Whatever you do, do not pick up the Guinea pig by his tail. Because if you pick it up by its tail, its eyes fall out of its head and run across the floor." Now the kids are little. So they are looking. Oh my goodness. Okay. Do not under any circumstances, unless you want his eyes just rolling, cause we don't know how to put em back. Okay. Okay. Now if you step out of the box for just a minute, you might go back to some high school biology class or having a Guinea pig of your own, Guineas don't have tails. Some of you knew that. So we gave the Guinea to the kids and we followed him into the bedroom. Kimberly and Michael are standing there, saying, "David, you're the big one. You find its tail." And he's looking at the Guinea pig, "I can't find his tail." Because Guineas have no tail. Now this is the distraction to get my engineer loose so he will hear the rest of my story. And we named the Guinea Weedy because he whistled, he whistled, whistled. And we'd open the refrigerator at night and he'd think, "Oh, they're opening the magic box of strawberries," and he'd whistle whistle, whistle. And we'd feed him some strawberries. And we loved him. And one day, my son, who was only five, put Weedy in the backyard to eat grass because he loved grass. And he forgot him. And Weedy got sunstroke and he died. And Michael brought him in the house and I and David and Kimberly, we sat and we cried and I called my husband up at work. And I said, "You've got to come home." And he came home and we all cried. And we got a piece of red velvet and we wrapped Weedy in the red velvet. We got in the car and my husband drove us two miles away to the railroad tracks. And we got out and he dug a hole and we laid Weedy in his red velvet at the bottom of the hole with a strawberry and a piece of carrot, what he loved, put the dirt on him. My husband looked at the children and he said, "Do you know why we buried him by the railroad tracks?" And we all said, "No." And he said, "Because now Weedy will never be lonesome. He can hear the train when it whistles and he'll never be lonesome." And that made us feel happy. We missed him. But Weedy would never be lonesome. So we went home that night. And we're sitting in the front yard. And Michael comes over with the 15 year old neighbor boy. He's five. The neighbor boy is this tall. And the neighbor said, "Mrs. Eliot, you need to know Michael wanted to go in the backyard, my backyard, and light matches." And I'm looking at Michael standing there and I'm thinking, "Something's wrong here. If he wanted to light matches, he's not gonna ask a 15 year old who's gonna come tattle on him immediately." So I went in the house and I called my father, who was a wise man. And I said, "This is what happened. What do I do?" And Dad said, "You put Michael on your lap and you look at him in the eyes which is the creation of a trance. And you say, "Sometimes the pain of an accident hurts more than any punishment anyone can ever give you." And Daddy said, "Say that over and over and you will know when to stop." So I put him on my lap and I said, "Sometimes the pain of an accident hurts more than any punishment anyone can ever give you." And the fourth time I said it, he looked at me and he said, "I killed my Guinea. I need a spanking." And I just kept saying it. And pretty soon he burst into tears. And then I could comfort him. And that was the story that the man used for a completely different purpose. Because he picked it up and changed it around and sometimes the pain of something just the event is more than any punishment, anyone, including I, can give me time to let go. And he did. I had no idea and since then I have told that story several times. And I just got done telling it in an overseas workshop. And what one of the listeners did was he said, "And now I can forgive my mother." And then he stood straight and tall and he said, "I have waited 41 years for this." Now that's the power of a story. I certainly didn't talk about Vietnam. I certainly didn't talk about the pain of a mother who abandoned you. I didn't talk about anything except what happened. And I left it open. So when you tell a story that has an open ending, it may have an ending, but it's not a boxed in ending and then they got married and everybody lived happily ever after. That's an ending ending. Where it's just left open, it stays alive because my children are completely grown now. We don't talk about Weady except if we hear a train whistle. And then there's silence. There was their whole growing up. We'd be driving, we'd hear a train go across river tracks, the car would fall silent and somebody would say, "Wasn't Weady wonderful?" I moved in a house, I've got railroad tracks maybe 200 yards, 200 meters from my house. And each of my kids came separately, not deliberately, but because of their schedule. Each one of them had to drive across the railroad tracks to get to my new house. I kept my mouth shut. And each one of them at some point in the visit said the equivalent, "Did you buy this house for Weady Mom?" And I didn't, but I thought about him when I bought the house. Now, when you tell a story, you can have all the motives you want. And that's what I'm saying, in order to craft one, you've gotta have a motive. But it doesn't mean that they're going to use it. Because the original purpose of that story was to let this engineer have a faint prickle behind his eyes because it is very touching that we buried him by the railroad tracks so he wouldn't be lonesome. Which is also how grief feels. So he is okay, not us. Okay? Now, there's several others stories that are so useful for people. One that I tell a lot. Cause you get past denial. Cause you know. So I wasn't loved well. So my parents didn't love me. So whatever whatever. Now I don't believe we have to go back and wallow through this. But I believe denial prevents healing. And I'm into healing. The difference between therapy and healing is healing is what you do to you. Therapy is what I do to you. When the doctor puts a cast on your leg, that's therapy. You have to heal. When you come to me for psychotherapy, I need to know interventions and I need to know what I'm doing. But my real job is to give you an arena for you to heal. Okay? And the story I tell, might not ever go further with it than the story, except I also tell all my parents to do this with their kids. Is once I had a wonderful father and an eight year old. And the eight year old had to tell his wonderful father, that's important, a terrible thing about Mom. And he didn't want to. And he's crying and crying and crying. "You tell him Betty, you tell him." "No, I'm not gonna tell him. You know why I'm not gonna tell him? Because he's eight years old and he speaks English just like his father speaks English. So he has to, because he has a good dad. Now if he had a not good dad, I would've taken him off the hook but with a good dad, that's helping him be autonomous and brave and who he really needs to be." So Dad comes in and they sit down. And little boy tells Dad, and Dad doesn't move. And I'm thinking, "Oh Dad. You got to. You gotta move. You gotta do something for him, for you, for me." So I said, "Dad, son is afraid to tell you this for fear it wouldn't please you." Dad didn't even look at me. He looked at son and he said, "Do you know how to please me?" The little boy says, "No." Dad said, "First you breathe in, and then you breathe out and that's all it takes." And that is what everybody deserves. And that's what most, many people don't get. And that's a law of the universe, that children are entitled to that. And if they don't get it, there's a loss. Not only did they not get that unconditional love, cause you know as a grownup you can't get unconditional love, you know that. Cause when I have a spouse telling me, "I love my wife unconditionally," I'm always fascinated. No kidding. So if you came home and she's in the bedroom with your best friend, you'd say, "That's okay honey. I love you unconditionally." And he said, "Well no." Well now there are conditions. Okay? But when you're four, you can't do anything wrong. When you're five, when you're six, so you are entitled to unconditional love. Cause what can you do? Throw a rock? Stamp your foot? Power? You're still a little kid. And if you don't get it, law of the universe, I believe, there's a loss. And partly it's a life factor. Because if I don't love you unconditionally, back in the caveman days, the Saber tooth tiger ate somebody. It wasn't my kids. Cause my kids were around me. And it's so scary to realize that your parents don't, can't, aren't, that you cover it over and cover it over and cover it over and cover it over and pretty soon we're not even talking about that problem, which is too scary. But you can talk about it without talking about it. By that story. Because that story says what you're supposed to have in tune. So it's very directly indirect. And when you teach people directly yet indirectly, there's nothing to argue about, nothing to fight against. Because they've made the final decision. Okay? Alright now. The words you choose are important. Because words have more meaning than just the actual words. So does tone. So does the syntax, the context, because. My son told me once that everybody in the store was talking about, he was working at a fast food place, and he says, "Everybody's talking about school. They're all talking about when they got arrested. And when this and they're on parole." My son is not on parole. And then he says, "We just hired a new girl and she's really pretty." And I thought, "Oh my god." Because he's telling me indirectly this girl is, "David, what was she arrested for?" And he says, "How do you know?" Well, he told me but he didn't realize he told me. He told me in the story of what was going on at work. To be a good storyteller, you have to practice, practice, practice. And you have to have courage to practice. Because you never know the result of a story. You never know if they're gonna hear it, if they're gonna save it, if they're going to say, "Why did you tell me that story for?" You are communicating with them. Metaphors can be just a few words. Warm as toast. Heart of ice. Those are just a few words. They can also be much longer in a crafted story. 

04:03:00

04:03:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I had a mother once who was not gonna let go of her child. And there was this enormous fighting in this family because the kid wanted independence and mom's like, "You are not gonna leave my..." And the kid is like 18, 19. Didn't need mom to hold his hand as he crossed the street. This mom was saying, "I'm his mother. I'm gonna take care of him." Well when you take care of somebody past a certain point, it's your comfort and you're crippling them. And just those words are enough for a lot of mothers, a lot of parents. Because it's your comfort. Of course we wanna keep our kids gathered around our knees and never drive a car, never leave the house, never do anything that, because that's the only way I can protect you. But it doesn't work that way. We gotta let em go. And it's very hard. And so I thought and I told the mother a story about, I saw it on a Walt Disney channel. You know what mother bears do? They have two cubs usually. Maybe one, but usually two. And they keep those cubs for two summers, or this particular variety of bear does. And they teach them how, they get em fat and they teach them how to catch mice and rabbits and eat berries and all the stuff that bears need to do. And they teach them how to be protected, they have a way, because if a male bear comes he'll kill the cubs. So they teach em, run up a tree. And then mom will fight the bear, the bad bear, and when she wins, which hopefully she wins, cause what is that saying, "No fury like a mother bear." So then she makes another chirp and the bears come down. Well the end of the second summer, these bears, they know how to catch their food, they're fat, they're ready for hibernation. They know how to do it. So she looks at em and she makes the danger sound. And they run up the tree. Cause that's what they've been trained to do. And then, I don't know what she thinks, but she looks at em and she turns around and she walks away. And eventually the bears come down because you never see bear skeletons in trees, starved to death bear cubs. So they come down and then live their own lives. And that's just a story I saw on Disney, which made me cry when I saw it. And then we talked about other things. And as we were leaving the room, she looked at me and she said, "Grrr. It's hard to be a bear." Because you don't talk about what you get from this metaphor. You trust they're gonna hear it, change it to what they want it, make it into their stories. And I will have clients come back and tell me, "Oh you told the story about this," and I'm thinking, "Nah, not me. But hey if it works I'll take the credit." Because once you tell it, it belongs to you. Now the most important thing is the trance. So if you want me to demonstrate how effective a metaphor, an anecdote can be with someone, I have to have a demonstration subject. And before anybody volunteers, I don't want a problem that is the day I was born kind of problem. And I'm also not good enough to deal with "I want you to motivate me to go to the gym three times a week and exercise." I'm not good enough to do that. Okay? Maybe somebody is. Not me. So does somebody have a reasonably contained problem that they don't mind coming up on stage with? And I have a demonstration subject. Excellent. Cause the rest of you are sitting here. You? Oh, I'm sorry. You're the volunteer. You got to sign a paper. 

04:08:15
[sil.] 

04:08:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I'm sorry? 

04:08:30
[sil.] 

04:08:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Let's make the announcements now while she is doing this. What are the announcements? 

04:08:40
UNKNOWN  We had questions about certificates, cause four of you have completed all eight sessions of this track, I believe that we have those. And they'll be in the back so just go ahead and ask the volunteers who are in the back and they'll get those for you. Also at the end of this session, we're gonna need everybody to either exit out the back or move over to this side of the room so that way we can open up the walls for the keynote. Thanks. 

04:09:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Well Dana, you not only have a nice name, you're very patient. Okay. So tell me why you volunteered. 

04:09:25
UNKNOWN Because I have a problem that appears to be simple. 

04:09:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You have something that appears to be simple? 

04:09:35
UNKNOWN Yes. I'm stuck in it. 

04:09:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But you're stuck in it? 

04:09:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:09:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Excellent. Not excellent, you're stuck. But yeah. 

04:09:45
UNKNOWN It's excellent that I can get the help. 

04:09:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Excellent that you're willing to come up here and we're gonna do something. Okay. You have to tell me. And don't pay any attention to them. 

04:10:00
UNKNOWN  So tell you what the problem is? 

04:10:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  You have to tell me something. 

04:10:10
UNKNOWN Okay. I feel like I am a mother bird who has two boys, 14 and eight. And they fight. The eight year old is really aggressive and bugs the 14 year old who is really gentle and compassionate. But the compassion that the 14 year old can offer to everyone is not offered to the eight year old. And I feel the pressure of creating harmony and peace between the two. And you know, the harder I try, the more complex their dynamic becomes. 

04:11:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely. 

04:11:00
UNKNOWN What to do? I can't shrink them. I can help everybody else. I can't help my own kids. 

04:11:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  This is a very... 

04:11:15
[sil.] 

04:11:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Now this is just a side issue because this is not, I'm just gonna ask you something. Do you have consequences in place for them? Or do you just talk? 

04:11:40
UNKNOWN  No. I try consequences. I tried to use talk as the initial approach. 

04:11:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You wanna know one of the interesting things that I've discovered about parents? Including me. 

04:12:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:12:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And kids. Do you ever watch the Charlie Brown specials on television? 

04:12:05
UNKNOWN Sometimes. 

04:12:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Do you know, think about watching them. 

04:12:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:12:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  And the children, they all talk amongst each other. Right? Charlie Brown and Lucy. Even Snoopy, I think, talks. What do the grownups sound like? 

04:12:25
UNKNOWN  Gibberish. 

04:12:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah. Wah wah wah. 

04:12:30
UNKNOWN I haven't watched it for a long time. But I'm just guessing that they sound like this broken machines. They go wah wah wah. 

04:12:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Exactly. And every kid learns from the time he's four years old, that when grownups talk, how do... absolutely. Very useful sometimes for them. So do you have consequences? Cause this is a side issue, cause you're, I'm talking about you. 

04:13:10
UNKNOWN Yes. With the eight year old, I take his iPod, iPad, whatever, the gadget he has, the games, I take it away. It's a measured consequence. It's taken away for an hour or two hours. And he throws a big tantrum and he goes and bothers the other one more because he was the cause of it. Then I try to separate them, try to distract them, try to redirect it. Then I say, I go into bribery. I say I have a marble jar. If you don't bother your brother, you get two marbles. But that lasts for like two and a half hours. And they're at it. And my pain is they are okay with everybody else. The 14 year old is the sweetest compassionate mature boy. When it comes to the relationship with the brother, he turns into a two year old. And vice versa. There must be something that I am doing wrong, I have determined, to accept my wrongdoing. But I don't know what it is. 

04:14:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I don't think you have wrongdoing. I think what you're doing isn't working. 

04:14:25
UNKNOWN  The same thing. 

04:14:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh no no no. Very very different. You're not doing anything wrong. If I picked you up and dropped you in China, are you doing wrong cause you don't speak Chinese? 

04:14:45
UNKNOWN No. 

04:14:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Of course not. So it's not wrongdoing. It's that you don't know how to do something different. So it's almost as though you are taking some responsibility that doesn't belong to you. You're not doing wrong. 

04:15:20
[sil.] 

04:15:25
UNKNOWN It is. I feel it's the obligation to, 

04:15:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Obligation. 

04:15:35
UNKNOWN  To help them see, help the 14 year old become aware of the way, the compassion that he is inside him and develop some tolerance towards the eight year old. He's just a menace. And the eight year old to see that people have limits and you can't go bump them and push them and kick them and make fun of them. 

04:16:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Nagida, you're a really nice lady. And we don't have a whole lot of time. So I'm really gonna push you. Is that okay? 

04:16:20
UNKNOWN Yes, go ahead. 

04:16:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. When you say this, and I'd be talking different if we had a long office thing, but not really. You're not doing anything wrong. You don't know how to make other people change. And I don't know how to make other people change. I can't even get you to agree, you're ready? That you're not doing anything wrong. Because if you were dropped in China, are you wrong cause you can't speak Chinese? Of course not. You may have an obligation to learn it. But you're not doing anything wrong if you don't know. Are you? No. That one's hard, isn't it? 

04:17:30
UNKNOWN It is hard. 

04:17:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Now I am in total agreement with you that you want your situation to change. Would you call yourself a really nice soft, a nice mother? 

04:17:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. I mean I'm not a pushover. Yeah. I'm nice because I have balance and I'm loving, affectionate, very giving but also very, 

04:18:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That's a good mother. 

04:18:05
UNKNOWN A disciplinarian also. 

04:18:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That's a good mother. Nice, affectionate, loving. All those good things. Would your kids say you're too nice? 

04:18:15
UNKNOWN  No. They would say, "She is very good." He said it, the 14 year old, he said, "You're very good. Good mom. We have a good mom." 

04:18:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You are. 

04:18:30
UNKNOWN He said it. I don't believe it because I'm stuck. 

04:18:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  You know what, you are a perfect subject because you're making me work. 

04:18:40
UNKNOWN  Thank you. I appreciate the help. 

04:18:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON No no no no. So I'm gonna push you really really hard. Okay? 

04:19:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:19:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. You are a good mother and I'm sure your son says you are a good mother. You know what I hear? Cause I can hear anything I want. 

04:19:10
UNKNOWN  Let me hear. 

04:19:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  I hear that you're really, you love your children very much. You very much want them to do the right thing. And they got your number. 

04:19:30
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

04:19:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  So if they got your number, what is the only thing you have, you can really do? 

04:19:50
UNKNOWN  I got it. I got it. I think I got it. 

04:20:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Tell me. 

04:20:05
UNKNOWN  I have to change my number. 

04:20:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Super. 

04:20:15
[sil.] 

04:20:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Super. Excellent excellent. Cause I believe that you're a good loving mother. But boy do they have your number. Just like somebody's phone, somebody has the number of that phone. Now you wanna raise your number. What do you wanna change your number to be? 

04:20:55
UNKNOWN Chinese. 

04:21:00
[sil.] 

04:21:05
UNKNOWN Everybody speak Chinese. 

04:21:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  That is so perfect. 

04:21:10
UNKNOWN Yes yes. To do something very different that will speak differently to them. 

04:21:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Speak a different language. Not language as in Chinese. Okay. Once upon a time my dad was telling me a story and I was really, it was hard for me to understand what he was saying. And he said, you grew up here in the states? 

04:21:45
UNKNOWN No. 

04:21:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Okay. 

04:21:50
UNKNOWN I've lived here for 28 years. 

04:21:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. This is the only way I know how to tell it, cause I wanna tell this story, is to give you some information. Many many years ago when there was a lot of country roads, and a lot of much less emphasis on automobile safety. And you know teenagers think they're invulnerable. And Daddy asked me, he said, he didn't ask me if I had ever done it. But he said, "You know? Sometimes teenagers get on a country road and they put their left tire on the center line on this small road, not a freeway, just a road. And they drive down the center of that road real fast and laugh when all the other cars get out of their way and honk their horns and shake their fists." Daddy said, "And then comes a great big 18 wheeler. And he doesn't care. And what do the kids do?" 

04:23:15
UNKNOWN  Get out of the way. 

04:23:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Get out of the way. Exactly. So when I say you gotta not care, I think that of course you care and of course the truck driver did not wanna run over four stupid teenagers. But I think you gotta not care when you turn into sort of a drill sergeant number. 

04:24:00
[sil.] 

04:24:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON What does that mean to you? 

04:24:15
[sil.] 

04:24:15
UNKNOWN It doesn't mean I don't care. It means letting go. 

04:24:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It doesn't mean you don't care. 

04:24:30
UNKNOWN It doesn't mean I don't care from my heart or my head. It means that I can get out of the way because there is only the outcome of me being on that road, is only a crash, that would injure everyone. At the very least it will injure the truck driver emotionally. Makes him a murderer and makes me a victim. And all of that. 

04:24:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  And if they don't learn they're gonna continue and then what? The teenagers and the car? If they don't learn, they better not do that. What's gonna happen to them? 

04:25:20
UNKNOWN They will never learn. My number is not ringing there. It's not. It's not ringing for me. They gotta learn it on their own. But I'm knowing it now that I'm working it with you cause I know it in the head but. 

04:25:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Do you know it here? 

04:25:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Somewhere somewhere in my bones I guess. 

04:25:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Not bad. You know it in your heart too? 

04:26:00
UNKNOWN In my heart? 

04:26:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Heart. 

04:26:00
UNKNOWN In my heart. Yes. 

04:26:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Super. 

04:26:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:26:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Super. And you know once I had a student who was in eighth grade, gonna go into high school, couldn't read, at a second grade level. And I said to the father, "Well summer's coming. And this young man needs to read cause if he reads he'll get to be a better reader. And you're gonna need to get books from the library, second grade level and you're gonna need to read em cause he'll lie to you and read the book and then have him read the book and report to you. But you have to read the book too." You follow what I mean? 

04:26:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:26:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And the dad says, "Oh, Betty, it's just so hard to make him read. It's just so hard." And I said, "What? You think it's gonna be easier when he's in high school?" And the dad said, "Well, no. But it's just too hard for me to do." And I said, I still remember how astonished I was. I said, "So you're gonna put your discomfort on the mantel and worship it rather than do the right thing for your son?" And he looked at me and said, "Yeah, I guess I am." Taught me a whole lot. Yeah. That was one of the things it taught me. Wow. 

04:27:55
UNKNOWN I just learned too because something else just came to me. I think, I don't know, maybe I'm crazy but I think in some ways I'm like that father because I am uncomfortable if I let them just be and figure it out on their own. I'm uncomfortable with that. And my comfort is to intervene. 

04:28:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Well you're exactly the opposite from that father. 

04:28:25
UNKNOWN You think? 

04:28:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh I know. Because you're gonna take positive steps that are going to, you're gonna change your number. And that's always hard. 

04:28:40
UNKNOWN How do I do that? 

04:28:45
[sil.] 

04:28:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You think you're too nice? 

04:28:50
[sil.] 

04:28:50
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

04:28:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Take an iPad away for one hour. 

04:29:00
[sil.] 

04:29:05
UNKNOWN Okay two. No a day, the way it's going. 

04:29:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  And even that. One of the things that, excuse me, that I learned when I was growing up, oh this will be good. 

04:29:30
UNKNOWN Yes tell me. 

04:29:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON We used to do, all of us kids did yard work. Okay? And we don't put our tools away. Alright, cause we're kids. And I can remember Daddy coming into the bedroom, two in the morning turning on the lights, sitting on the foot of the bed, and saying, and I'm gonna look just at you, "Betty Alice, you left the rake in the backyard again." And I'm saying, "I'll go get it." "No, no," he'd say. "Let's talk about it because I must be doing something wrong for you to forget this." And I'd say, "Daddy let me go to sleep." "No, we gotta discuss this." Okay? 

04:30:45
UNKNOWN But this is not a true story, this is the great Erickson you're talking about. 

04:30:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Well. 

04:30:55
UNKNOWN Just tell me if it is. 

04:31:00
[sil.] 

04:31:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON There. 

04:31:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

04:31:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  He thought it up but he didn't patent it. 

04:31:15
UNKNOWN  He really did this? 

04:31:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON He did not patent it. Another because the purpose of a punishment or a consequence is first of all inconvenience. If I were to ask you would you rather pay a speeding ticket or would you rather go to the, what we have in Texas is an all day traffic school. 

04:31:50
UNKNOWN Oh, I get the checkbook. 

04:31:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Me too. Because the purpose of punishment is inconvenience. So it's inconvenient for you, but you're the mother. You have a father in the household too? 

04:32:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:32:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And the father. To come in and have a lengthy discussion you don't even have to include either one of them. Cause if one of you is sitting on the bed and the other on the other end of the bed having this discussion, well he has to be either one, be wide awake listening to you two talking as though he's not even there. How much you think he's gonna like that? Do you think he's gonna like it? 

04:32:45
UNKNOWN No. 

04:32:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Of course not. 

04:32:50
UNKNOWN If we did it, he'd want to go to sleep. 

04:32:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Exactly. They all do. Or you could get him up at five 30 cause you're up and you couldn't sleep and you wanted to talk about this. Both of them. Get the eight year old up. "Well I'm making breakfast here, we're just sitting here watching the sun rise. I just was curious what you thought about this." So you have, you don't have to do anything, but you have to be creative. Another consequence that people hate but it's really good we take things away from people. That's good sometimes if it's more than an hour. 

04:33:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:33:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Is to make them do something. Do you have a silverware drawer in your house that's a mess or is the linen closet untidy? 

04:34:00
UNKNOWN  We can find that. 

04:34:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Well, I want you to clean that silverware drawer and make it spotless and while you're doing it, you can be thinking about being nicer to your brother. "I won't do it." Okay. This is what you have to do before you have anything else; television, bedtime, dinner, which happens to be your favorite food, cause nobody starves to death in one night. Anything. But then when he cleans the silverware drawer, everybody gets to admire it. And that's really important. Because then you have changed a bad behavior with a consequence and he can be proud of the consequence. And they're never proud enough of it to do the bad behavior so they get the consequence. That's not gonna happen. You follow what I mean? 

04:35:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:35:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But as long as they gotta be punished, they might as well be happy about it. At the end. Cause you're teaching them a paradoxical message there. It's better to be happy for production than to get your own way cause that's not real happiness. 

04:35:50
[sil.] 

04:35:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So tell me what you're thinking or feeling. 

04:36:00
UNKNOWN Hopeful. The wheels are turning in that how how I will create a different presentation. 

04:36:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON No, a different number. 

04:36:20
UNKNOWN Number. 

04:36:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Presentation's too big. 

04:36:25
UNKNOWN Oh. Make it simple. Without trying too hard. 

04:36:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Without trying to what? 

04:36:30
UNKNOWN Too hard. Without trying too hard, changing the number. Do something different without trying too hard. I think that's what gets me into trouble. 

04:36:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  I think what gets you into trouble and I don't know your house, cause this is a demonstration and we gotta move. I think you're too nice. 

04:36:55
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

04:37:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Cause the purpose of kids is to get their own way. 

04:37:10
[sil.] 

04:37:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And I think, you said I could hit you, not hit you, but you said I could push you. 

04:37:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. You can push me. 

04:37:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I think you like being nice because you're a nice lady. And I don't think you, I think you're very comfortable being nice, which is a wonderful blessing for those around you except when it's not. And I think you're uncomfortable not being what you call nice. You want them to have the adolescence, the youngster-hood that they think they want, or do you care about their future? 

04:38:10
[sil.] 

04:38:10
UNKNOWN I hear you. 

04:38:15
[sil.] 

04:38:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I wanna give you two more things. Okay? I ask my clients a lot you only have one decision to make, for many things. Are you a long term player or a short term player? Do you know what that means? 

04:38:35
UNKNOWN  Yes. Yes. 

04:38:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Only decision we have to make a lot of time, long term, short term. 

04:38:45
UNKNOWN Yes. Long term. Definitely. Definitely. No question about it. 

04:38:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah. If you love em it is. If you love them more than you love, and you fear your discomfort, of course. 

04:39:00
UNKNOWN Yes no question. 

04:39:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Of course. Of course. And the other thing is every time you hear a phone ring, I want you to think about is my number right? 

04:39:25
[sil.] 

04:39:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Now, can we talk about this with the audience? 

04:39:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:39:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And you know the rule I have when I have a demonstration subject? That nothing the audience asks or I say can change anything that is good that happened inside you. Okay? And you know what I did this morning with a really nice subject? I said, "Pinky promise." 

04:40:10
UNKNOWN  I promise. Thank you. 

04:40:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Stay here. Does anyone have any questions about what we did or for her? And, excellent, please use the mike too. 

04:40:35
UNKNOWN  This is a question for the subject, for the volunteer. Do you fell, were you in a trance, do you feel that you entered a trance? 

04:40:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  I felt I couldn't escape it. 

04:40:55
[sil.] 

04:41:00
UNKNOWN It was invisible because I didn't know whether or not this was going to be a sort of hypnotic trance session. I didn't know if this was some sort of an informal induction because I don't do hypnosis in my work. I come in because everything I learn here helps me tremendously. So I was in an unknown land. I was in China. But your gaze, your energy, and intention and connection was inescapable. And that pulled me in. And I think when the first realization came, it was so authentic that I did feel that something moved. And I don't know. The verbiage of it is very simple. But the emotional experience of it was really beyond words, I think. Thank you. 

04:42:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Thank you. Because thank you and thank you for asking that question. This is oh she was in trance, absolutely she was, in my opinion. It was conversational trance. And it was a connection trance and the purpose of a trance is really to connect better, whether it's formal or informal. The purpose of a trance is to communicate better whether it's formal or informal. And on one level, it's not inescapable cause if she'd wanted to leave, you could've. You could've said, "You're crazy Betty." You could've. But what wouldn't have fit. 

04:43:15
UNKNOWN  I wanted to be in it. 

04:43:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I know. 

04:43:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:43:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Because remember when I said the two things necessary for a trance are I'm in a trance, which I was, and I offer it to you with an air of delighted expectation. Of course you're gonna join me. Of course you are. And people do because I sincerely believe people are starving for connections. And the words you chose touched my heart, that it was the intentionality she knew my intentionality was good. And it was authenticity. And that touches my heart. And thank you. Because that is when you offer that, how can they refuse? And that one's true. And this lady? 

04:44:20
UNKNOWN  I just had a, it's not a hypnosis, but Danny Bulue teaches a lot of impact techniques and one of the techniques she would use with children would be like the parakeet. Oh, your brother's saying this or your other brother's saying this. And you're not in between. Anyway, she uses pictures also with kids and it's outside of the exercise but just to respond to... 

04:44:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And this is another way but this is the way I do it with you because one of the things I like is simplicity and when it is just you and me, that's as simple as it can get. Except you are living in China. Okay. Any other comments or questions? I don't really want comments or questions cause this was excellent. She did good. 

04:45:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

04:45:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I wasn't able to tell a crafted story. But I was able to tell two or three snippets of stories. Thank you. 

04:45:45
UNKNOWN Yes. My question is for you Betty. That at a certain point you said you kind of complimented her on, she was being a difficult or complicated patient. And then she laughed, she agreed to it. At that point was that a true statement for you? Which possible ways could you have gone and how did you choose to go where you went? 

04:46:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That is a wonderful question. It really is. Now if you think back to what I said, what I said was truthfully you are a wonderful demonstration subject because you're making me work so hard. And then everybody laughed and you laughed too. And that was absolutely true. She was making me work hard, which is a, that's not what I want, I want it easy as pie. But the best demonstrations are when you know that I'm working hard because she's not making it easy. Cause when they make it easy, you don't learn very much. But when you can see and I don't learn as much. Because when you made me work hard, that's a gift to me too because I'm not, oh here this one. Nothing worth having comes along easy. 

04:47:25
UNKNOWN But I have a question about this. I, my experience was it, I wasn't making it hard or it wasn't my intention. I wanted to invite you in my reality. And in fact I think I didn't say all of it. It wasn't hard enough. 

04:47:50
[sil.] 

04:47:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You were hard enough. Okay? 

04:47:55
UNKNOWN  I am moving to China. 

04:48:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Were you upset or insulted when I said that? 

04:48:05
UNKNOWN No, not at all. I felt that maybe what you were telling me was why are you making your own life so hard? That's what I heard. 

04:48:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON  Okay. See what they do. When you are truly connected, which we were, connected, see what they do. They hear you on multiple levels. And when you're authentically connected, they really really hear you. Now, nothing's gonna change. Right? We got this, we got it. Right? 

04:49:05
UNKNOWN Oh yes. Oh yes. 

04:49:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. That thought did enter my head. That you were making your own life hard. But not in a judgmental way. In a compassionate, loving way. Because when we're connected like this, there's virtually no judgment. Cause I hear you, I feel you, I know you and you me. And I couldn't not tell you the truth. Excellent. Excellent. This lady has one more question. 

04:49:55
UNKNOWN  I wanted to ask the subject, of the snippets of stories, that Alice told you, which impacted you more or did any of them impact you? 

04:50:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Well the short answer is all of them. But the long answer is the image that came to me was when I first came to America 28 years ago my biggest wish was to go to Disneyland. You know? So when I saw that exhibition It's a Small World, and you get into my story, it's interesting, I never tell stories like that. But when I got on that boat, and saw all of these dolls and all of these people and lands and places and songs, it was the most exhilarating experience. And when she was telling me those stories, every one of them was like a delight. It was like oh, oh yeah, another truth, another gift. So that's the long answer. 

04:51:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

04:51:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And that is the connection. And then I wanna have time to do, for vanity reasons I wear a watch that I can't read very well. So that's why I have to... This is the last question. 

04:51:40
UNKNOWN I just wanted to observe and to comment that I really loved the fact or the imagery that you're using of having created trance through the connection and through the intensity and the connectedness of the interaction between the two of you. I've taken hypnosis training in the past and now here again, a lot of emphasis is on the very formal inductions and then you say this and then you do that, and then you speak in this way. When very often in my experience, 35 or 36 years of working with families, a lot of the time you're creating that kind of trance through the connection that you're having with the clients that are with you in the room without doing anything formal. And so I'm just so pleased, it's more of a comment really than a question but I'm really very happy to hear you affirm that that's possible. 

04:52:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yes. But I also wanna say I am a believer in learning techniques first. Because when you know techniques, and you know them well, and you have experience, then you, it's much, you know what you're doing so much more. It's like Salvador Nuchin once said, not once, 3,000 times, he said, "First you learn all the techniques, all of them. And you learn em well. And then you can throw them out the window." Because I sometimes use formal trance too. But my preference is conversational. And you were wonderful. 

04:53:30
UNKNOWN  It was you. 

04:53:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You were. Thank you very much. 

04:53:40
[sil.] 

04:53:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You have to take that off. 

04:53:50
UNKNOWN I have to say che che. Che che. It's thank you in Chinese. 

04:54:00
[sil.] 

04:54:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That was perfect. 

04:54:10
[sil.] 

04:54:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Now this is a large audience. You think you can do a pretty easy exercise? You think you can? You wanna try? Cause it is a big audience. I'm waiting for either nods or terrified. Alright. And since there's so many people, which is really nice, what I want you to do is I'm gonna give you I got it, I'm gonna give you a more or less silent exercise. Okay? I want it in groups of three. Okay. A B C. Okay? A works with B to start with. It sounds more complex than it is. C is the observer. Okay? A looks at B for 40 seconds and I will tell you, I will time you. You look, A looks at B, 40 seconds. And two times, two separate times. The first time A is thinking, "I'm hungry. I wish I'd eaten more. Did I turn the oven off? Can, I need mayonnaise at the grocery store." Is thinking casual, neither good nor bad thoughts. While she's looking at B. Alright? Then she remembers whether, the other time she looks at B, first or second, it doesn't matter. She looks at B and thinks, "Yes. This is us. And we are together. And you're who you are and I'm who I am and we are together in this learning. And I like this." All these positive thoughts. Whatever you wanna make. I'll tell you when the 30 seconds is over. What'd I say? 30? 40. Okay. 40 seconds is over. And then stop. And then observer says, first no you, B, say, "The good one was first. The bad one, not so good one, was second." You confirm or separate, no I thought it was reverse. And then you tell the first one I was making a shopping list. The second one, I was really thinking good thoughts. Okay? You understand? And then B looks at C and A is the observer. Okay? You follow how this works? No words are spoken. None. Except at the end of the 40 second period. Okay? Each person, each person, okay I'm gonna wait till you get your chairs arranged. 

04:58:00
[sil.] 

04:58:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, you're gonna have to, you're gonna have to quiet down. Let me say I need somebody who can whistle loud. Is there someone in this room who can whistle real loudly? Thank you. Okay. Let me repeat. The exercise, the silent exercise. A looks at B two separate times for 40 seconds each. One of the two separate times, A is thinking innocuous thoughts. I didn't finish my book. I'm gonna read it. I need the gas needs filling up. The other 40 second period, he looks at B and thinks, "We're together. We're human. We're wonderful people. And we're both learning together and I respect and admire that you're here doing the best, just like I am and it's really good." End of that exchange. Then I say, "Talk quietly." B says, "First time you were making your shopping list. Second time you were connected. Observer, C, says, "Yeah, I agree." Or, "No, I thought it was the opposite." And then B says, "First time this. Second time that." Okay? It's really simple. But it's impactful. Now. 

05:00:15
[sil.] 

05:00:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah yeah. I'll tell you when to start and who's my whistle person? Who did that good? Excellent. It's a girl. Excellent. Okay. No I love it when a girl is. Okay. Girls rock and girls rule and look at that whistler there. Okay. So get ready. Get set. And go. 

05:01:00
[sil.] 

05:01:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Now onto the other way of thinking. Beginning now. 

05:01:45
[sil.] 

05:02:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And stop. Exchange information quietly. 

05:02:30
[sil.] 

05:03:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, get ready. Next round. Get ready for the next round. And my whistle girl. The whistler. Thank you. Ready for the next, ready for the next round. Okay. Beginning now. 

05:03:35
[sil.] 

05:04:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Switch. And beginning now. 

05:04:25
[sil.] 

05:05:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Exchange information quietly and the whistle lady better pay attention to me. 

05:05:20
[sil.] 

05:06:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Get ready. Get ready to, thank you. Okay? Now round three. Beginning now. 

05:06:30
[sil.] 

05:07:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Switch. 

05:07:15
[sil.] 

05:08:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Exchange information. 

05:08:10
[sil.] 

05:09:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay I know it's gonna be hard to come back. Oh what. This is great. Okay. 

05:09:30
[sil.] 

05:09:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah one more time. Okay. Excellent excellent excellent. Now before we have a question or a comment, cause you gotta be seated. How many people, how many people were right, were right in their guess? Way more than luck of the draw. How many people were surprised at how it felt? Excellent. Again, way more than the luck of the draw. Excellent. Okay, does anybody wanna say anything? Or make a comment? 

05:10:40
UNKNOWN Just a brief comment. I'm a clinical psychologist but I also have a background in massage therapy. And when I was in massage therapy school, we did this exercise where our partner was lying down, prone on the massage table and we would do laying of the hands and one of the times think about what do I have to get done and the other time. And down the line everyone could tell. So it's literally a single blind study. But down the line everyone could tell and I think that's really neat and I think this exercise is really exciting when the person who is doing the staring and the communicating tries to make it difficult to guess. Because then you're at the point where you're feeling, not just seeing. 

05:11:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Right. Right. Excellent. Thank you. 

05:11:30
UNKNOWN All of us got it right with each other and guessing each one. But it was, we all tried very hard so it was actually very subtle, and we all made it at first very subtle but we still called it right. And I don't know, from the feeling of it. 

05:11:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah. Because it is subtle because I was watching the group and you were all looking fixed at the other person intently. And we know more than we think we know. Yes sir? 

05:12:05
UNKNOWN One thing that this whole exercise makes me think about is the fact that in my own clinical practice, there are certainly times when hypnotic experience emerges. But there are other times, and I was thinking of one particular example, where I was trying to engage someone with the eye contact, it was not like a conscious process. But that's what I was doing. And it freaked her, freaked my patient out completely. She had a bad reaction to it. So I just wanna say that.

BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But then you can usually tell if people aren't comfortable and over the years when someone hasn't been comfortable, which has happened occasionally, I ask em. Cause if I don't know, if I don't ask em, I don't know. So I ask em, "Do you want me not to look at you?" And they usually say something like, "Oh I want you to look at me, it just makes me uncomfortable." Well that's okay then. I want you to look at me. It's nice to learn not to be uncomfortable. And where's my wonderful subject? There she is. It's nice to learn not to be. Okay. Alright. Yes sir?

UNKNOWN Just it's brought, a very powerful exercise first of all. And it brought and we were, in my group, able to tell precisely when the different thoughts were occurring. And I can translate this back to my practice because sometimes I'm really calm and centered during sessions. But and this makes me aware that I can work on being that way more of the time because other times I'm thinking, "Oh my god. This other person's been waiting out in the waiting room for ten minutes. Oh my god I forgot to call this other person back." And that it really brings to mind that does effect the quality of my therapy.

BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I think that my wonderful demonstration subject, when she said, "I felt it was the intentionality and the authenticity." And that can't be, I can't be thinking about, "Oh god they're waiting in the waiting room." And actually I don't have a wait in the waiting room. That never bothers me. What does bother me is sometimes this horror that oh my god I double-booked. And then I just tell em, just a second, I have to check my book. And then, because everybody knows we got stuff going on. They do too. So they let me. Then I can come back and be what I wanna be.

UNKNOWN  Thank you.

BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Okay. So we're just about at the end. We're gonna have a wonderful keynote. Beethoven and Erickson and Jeff wasn't at the Maria Bakerson, little discussion about my mother. But it's interesting because Lance, my brother Lance, the second oldest, he said one of his memories was that mom used to let us older kids, this was in Eloise, play records on the Victrola. And he said to this day Beethoven's fifth is my favorite. And I thought I'd forgotten that because I, not only like Beethoven, but Beethoven's fifth is my favorite. And now Jeff who mind read that that was going to occur, titled his keynote, "Erickson and Beethoven." So thank you Jeff. Okay. Thank you. You were a fabulous audience.
