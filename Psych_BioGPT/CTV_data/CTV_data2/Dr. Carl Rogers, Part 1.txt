ROGERS The Center for the Studies of the Person La Jolla, California MOTIVATION, PERCEPTION, LEARNING THE SELF CLIENT-CENTERED THERAPY ENCOUNTER GROUP MOVEMENT Interviewed in La Jolla, California September, 1970 by DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Professor of Psychology University of Houston 

00:00:30
NARRATOR Doctor Carl R. Rogers is noted for his significant contribution to psychological treatment described as non-directive or client-centered psychotherapy. From his keen clinical observations, he developed the baseline for personality research and a theory of personality which focuses on the self and experience. Doctor Rogers classic debates with B. F. Skinner led to a fascinating study in contrast between the experience-oriented view of man which he have held versus the behavior-oriented view of Doctor Skinner. After receiving his PhD in Psychology from Columbia University in 1931, he had held post at the Rochester Guidance Center, Ohio State University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Wisconsin. He is preferably a resident fellow at the Center for Studies of the Person in La Jolla, California. His current interest range from our continuing interest and personality theory in psychotherapy to the encounter group movement and our formal educational system. He is the author of a number of widely discussed books including the now classic Counseling and Psychotherapy and most recently, Freedom to Learn and Carl Rogers on Encounter Groups. Among his many distinctions was his election to the presidency of the American Psychological Association. It was for us a genuine pleasure to complete this one of two field dialogue with Dr. Rogers in a study of his home in La Jolla, California. 

00:02:05
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS So Doctor Rogers to begin our discussion, I like to sort of relate the-- some of your views to three of the rather important, ah, dimension that are almost always start within psychology namely motivation, perception and learning. Beginning first at what's motivation of course, we-- in psychology I kinda do define it that as all conditions which arouse directed the things in your organism and of course most prevalence in that kind of homeostatic model that, ah, we, we take it to Biology that are always try to reduce tension to meet-- maintain a state of equilibrium. 

00:02:40
DR. CARL R. ROGERS I don't agree with that point of view because I think that the-- your organism is definitely not trying to achieve thesis. I think the, ah, even an organism as low as of life forms are always trying to look for more enriching stimuli and more complicated stimuli. So, that, ah, that approach is not very, uhm, convenient with my point of view. 

00:03:00
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS No, but you will accept the homeostatic model? 

00:03:05
DR. CARL R. ROGERS No. 

00:03:05
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS You feel that our men is almost thriving for, ah, attention? 

00:03:10
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Always. I think that there is plenty of evidence to know that too. We call it in men we tend to call it curiosity. In lower animals that's, ah, a tendency to, to seek, ah, more complicated stimuli rather than simple one. 

00:03:25
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS There have been of course an attempt in, in Psychology to begin to look at very specific needs and try to develop, ah, our understanding of how they come about, how they developed them? One current example that, ah, McClelland and Atkinson is they were just illustrate one of these so-called need for achievement. What do you think is values in Psychology to taking specific needs in going back and try to study early patterns to formulate it? 

00:03:50
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Well, I think the best of value to McClelland and, and, uhm, uhm, I think there is truth in, some truth in all of these approaches. I think I'd rather, uhm, rather than try to comment, I know they'd rather say something about my own view of it. 

00:04:05
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Yes. 

00:04:10
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Uhm, since I was showing you this-- these two Britt Begonias that I'm-- that I read. Uhm, now, it reminds us what motivates the two Britt Begonias? Uhm, to grow from a little 2 inch bulb to this, ah, really beautiful plant and flowers. Uhm, well, it seems to me that they could say there must be a need for achievement because some of those blooms in when they're in their frame when they need it to cross. We say that it effects them because the male and female flowers grow on the same flower stock because that's poppycock and I think it's, ah, pretty much poppycock in regards to human beings. Now, there's things, ah, you can, you can describe the behaviors but I think that the, uhm, the much more basic thing is that every organism has a tendency to maintain itself, to enhance itself if possible, ah, eventually to reproduce itself, uhm, and, ah, to me, that basic tendency toward growth, toward maintaining and enhancing the organism is, ah, the central aspect of all motivation. Now, you can, you can say yes and some of that goes into a, ah, ah, seems to be describable as a need for achievement, uhm, some of it certainly is, ah, ah, channeled into a sexual drive and so forth. But, uhm, I had prefer to emphasize what to me is much more basic than any of those single, uhm, concepts. 

00:05:50
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Now, of course, ah, the same homeostatic model we're talking about are seen as related somewhat to Freudian Theory, ah, let's start out first by talking about his a construct of the unconscious. Ah, how do you regard of this, this construct of the unconscious? 

00:06:05
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Well, I think, ah, that I see the same sort of phenomena that, ah, Freud's on for which he developed this, ah, concept of the unconscious. I think that psychologist in general and perhaps psychology students especially tend to make things out of this, ah, ah, concept where really the, the attempt by someone to, ah, understand a-- an observable set of phenomena. Ah, I'd prefer to think of, uhm, a range from a sharp focus in awareness right now, ah, which is the height of consciousness through a, a range of material that could be called into consciousness that's really know and can call in the consciousness but you don't have it, ah, in, in figure it right now really is in ground. Then onto some others that are more and more dimly connected with awareness to material that, ah, is really, uhm, prevented from coming into awareness because if it did come into awareness, it would, ah, damage the person's, ah, concept of himself. 

00:07:25
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS So, ah, in a way then you're agreeing to some, to some extent with Freud's view but you, more or less, ah, are saying that perhaps in a more of a relevant sense. 

00:07:35
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Yes. Ah, it seems that I feels as that, uhm, to say I agree or disagree with Freud's concept of the unconscious is not very helpful, neither statement is very helpful. 

00:07:45
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Yes. 

00:07:45
DR. CARL R. ROGERS So, I'd rather, uhm, uhm, point out to the way I conceptualized the same kind of phenomena is along as this, ah, spectrum, this is continuum from, ah, materials that would be too threatening to even permit into awareness at all to materials it is, ah, right sharply in focus at, at the immediate moment. 

00:08:05
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS You spoke a few moment ago of course, a sexual motivation and of course, we, we know that, ah, Freud emphasized sexual motivation very heavily in his-- particularly his early works. And in particular, in his classic model of psychosexual development has been, ver-- very influential. How do you feel about this notion? 

00:08:30
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Well, I think that, uhm, there is a, ah, gerund of truth in all of that. I think that, uhm, for us, it is very much creature of his time in placing the great stress that he did-- done in the sexual aspect to development. Personally, I would, uhm, uhm, be more concerned with the development of the whole concept of self in the individual as it grows. And that's to be sure has influenced by, ah, ah, attitude and values and so on, ah, and perceptions which he introject from significant figures in his early life and all the way on up. I think that it's uhm, somewhat artificial to divide the, ah, development of a child into hard and fast, ah, stages. But, uhm, uhm, there, there's certainly is, ah, a, uhm, gradual development of the picture that he carries of himself and, uhm, that is a serious-- I mean, more important in just focusing on one aspect of that the, the sexual aspect of it. That's, that's the part of it. 

00:09:40
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS How do you, you feel that these really childhood experiences, ah, a can more or less continued to determine the individual's behavior over and over again. Now, you think that's powerful in their impact? 

00:09:50
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Yes. I think that the, uhm, early experience is, ah, a, a powerful force. Ah, I would say that, uhm, attitude and values that are introjected from the parents do have a continuing influence and that's-- sadly with, ah, repeatedly influenced their behavior. It's, uhm, if you're all along to hear, I'm, I'm objecting-- putting hard and fast state labels. I don't like the pigeonholes that, ah, Freudian Theory has developed into and other theories too. I think, uhm, ah, people handicapped their thinking when they, uhm, ah, think in terms of, of so many labels. I'd rather they observed the phenomena itself. 

00:10:35
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Well moving away from our kind of re-discussion of motivation where another very central area in psychology, as the area of perception. And as you're surely aware in the last several years who have been from other interesting developments in the area of perception we, ah, have moved perhaps from a, from an interest in a more precise studies of perception where we're trying to study sensory processes or relating the person's responses at very specific stimulus to where we're getting, ah, our feeling and interest in the overall responses sort of things that William James called stream of consciousness and the naive, immediate experience of individual as a whole, maybe more interesting to many psychologists today than a very precise reactions to specific stimuli. Ah, how do you regard this by fad? Do you feel that other type of a movement to phenomenology is in line with your own interest? 

00:11:30
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Yes, very definitely! I think that, uhm, to, ah, well, that I, I really am characteristic of trend that you mentioned. I recognized the, the narrow feel of perception as a neurological event as it feel very worthy of study but it's-- is it relatively little, ah, interest to me. I am more interested in the, ah, whole gestalt of what the person perceives in his environment, in himself, and so on. Ah, and, ah, I think that one thing that, ah, seems very true to me is that, uhm, there is no such thing I believed as a perception without a meaning. As is the human organism immediately attaches a meaning to whatever is perceived. I may, out of the corner of my eyes see, ah, a plane in the distance. But then as I turn my head that way, I discovered a little that the plane close by. Now, uhm, in other words, in each case, I attached a meaning to that perception immediately even though it may be an erroneous meaning is in that case. And, uhm, for me, and, uhm, perception is reality as far as the individual is concerned. I don't even know whether there is an objective reality, probably there is but none of us ever really know that. All we know is what we perceives and we try to test that in various ways and if it seems to be perceive in the same way from several different aspects, we regard it as real. Uhm, so that, ah, the world of reality for the individual is we'd all feel that perception was the meaning it is attached to those, ah, our various aspects. And I think that the, uhm, probably any organisms certainly the human organisms, uhm, is always trying to, ah, satisfy its need as they are experienced in the, uhm, total feel that he perceives it in the, in the, in the reality as he perceives it. 

00:13:45
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Well, as you go so far as, ah, agreeing with Immanuel Kant paraphrasing him, ah, very briefly when he said something like this that there is no reality except in terms of the man's perception of it would you live far? 

00:13:55
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Yes, I would. I have tried stealing that sometimes in candid it always lead to sort of fruitless arguments. So, I, uhm, I don't, ah, say so very often but, ah, ah, it really fits into here a moment ago - 

00:14:10
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Yeah. 

00:14:10
DR. CARL R. ROGERS - where none of us know for sure, ah, what constitutes objective reality and that we lived our whole lives in the reality as perceive. 

00:14:20
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS We talked about motivation. We talked a little bit about perception, we try to cover these vast areas in a few minutes. But of course, another very fundamental construct in psychology is that of learning. If I read your work correctly, you would, ah, apparently be moving more in a direction-- be more agreement with the Thomanian view with the emphasis of cognition rather than the, ah, highly behavior centered. In other words, you're more of with-- I have a-- be more than an experience as we've study learning and, ah, not necessarily this thing is focusing on behavior. 

00:14:50
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Yes, that's, ah, I think it would be closer to that, ah, ah, view. Uhm, I'd never been particularly interested in the atomistic theories of learning. I just think for that was primarily involved and to me, learning theory was a very boring subject. Uhm, I think that, ah, the kind of view I have of learning, uhm, is not entirely cognitive, I think it is holistic that the individual, ah, learns that the whole organism which includes ethics as well as, ah, as well as cognition. And, ah, I mentioned earlier this, ah, desire, ah, to enrich the stimuli with (inaudible ) is a very deep desire, ah, out of it goes a whole desire for play. And as I've known, uhm, uhm, permanent standards, I think that they are strongly motivated by that notion of play. They like to play with new ideas, new theories, new possibilities, new hunches. And, uhm, ah, it's like the small child too who, ah, is continuously on the go, on the move to, ah, one reason ways to, ah, hard to manage and get along with, ah, it's because he's continually trying to learn about his environment and all sorts of ways. Some of which, ah, don't quite fit in with adult notion. And I think that the, ah, this, this desire for learning, his desire to, to grasp something that is meaningful to the self, to the person at the moment is, ah, something that needs to be nurtured rather than molded. This is why I, uhm, grow a little fearful of some of the possible results of, ah, use of operant conditioning and so on. I think it's a big contribution, eh, in many ways. It also had its, ah, somewhat, ah, frightening aspects. And I would like to see instead, individuals encouraged to, ah, ah, follow their very deep desire to learn, to enrich, to grow, to create, uhm, that's what I think is the, uhm, most essential part of, of learning. And it is highly spontaneous, uhm, when this person feels that it is related to his own needs and to his own desire to enhance himself. 

00:17:40
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Now, moving away from these, ah, rather fundamental construct that we've been talking about so far, motivation, perception, learning. Ah, I-- looking more specifically at some of the sort of things that seems to be, ah, involved in your own writings and research over the years and you've already mentioned yourself and your answers on each other question. You only used the word self in a certain way, so I used the word ego in a certain way, what is the self as you see it? 

00:18:10
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Ah, I think they might lead up to that by saying, "Why I bec-- became interested in that, ah, particular constructs?" I certainly didn't start psychological work being interested in anything as they just the self. To me, that seems like, ah, old-fashioned introspection as who would be interested in that. I was really forced to examine it because, uhm, I'm, I'm forced to define it for myself because my clients in therapy, uhm, kept using that term in all kinds of significant ways. Ah, let say, uhm, I think I've got a pretty solid self, ah, underneath this kind of, phony exteriors or, uhm, or quite the opposite. I'd be terribly afraid of, of getting to know my real self. Uhm, all kinds of, of ways in which they showed that for them if this were the significant construct and I couldn't help but decide that, uhm, if it's so significant for them, then maybe I should take a uhm, more direct looked at it. And, the kind of definition that I give it, the kind of meaning it has for me is that, uhm, the self-include all of the perceptions the individual has of his organisms of his experience. And the way in which, uhm, those perceptions are related to others in his environment, to objects in his environment, ah, to the whole exterior world. Uhm, so that it is a, it is a, ah, complex pattern of perceptions of the, ah, individual as he perceived himself and in relation to, ah, uhm, in relation to himself and in relation to many, uhm, ah, experiences in realities outside of himself. 

00:20:15
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Now, of course, ah, if we again, looking at your view of the self, ah, and obviously it seems to have connected to it to some notion of growth. I wonder if you might, might have developed as well that, ah, well, what is-- what do we mean by self-actualization? 

00:20:30
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Well, I think that, ah, ah, we put it first inside of, uhm, ah, ideal way, ah, the organism is always endeavoring to actualize itself. And so, I was saying really when I starting by motivation and, uhm, when the self, ah, is in awareness of what is going on the organism then it keeps changing and growing and developing in the same way that the organism does. Now, interestingly enough, ah, in most of us, there are static aspect of the self and that really is what constitutes maladjustment. It's when uhm, I persist and holding a set views with myself, ah, which doesn't correspond as what is actually going on in my organism, uhm, that's maladjusted. Ah, take an extreme example, I think of a boy I knew a long time ago, ah, he's been raised in a very strict home, a very strict religious home and he had no sex feelings, he had no sex desires. Uhm, that was a part of his self pictures, uhm, then, I saw him because he was arrested for lifting the skirt of little girl. Uhm, in other words, his organism was experiencing all kinds of sexual curiosity and desire and so forth but as far as his self picture was concerned that was not a part of it at all. In fact, it was quite typical when he was arrested. He said, "That couldn't have been him, that couldn't have been him. He could not have done that." And in the strictly technical sense, is self-pictures couldn't do it, didn't do it? And that sense he's right. It was his organisms that, ah, was experiencing all these, uhm, drives and acting on them. Now, to change that to a picture of adjustment, you would need to be aware of and accepting of his sexual drives as well as his other, ah, aspects of himself. Then his picture of himself would match what was going on within his organism. And I would say he would much closer than to, to psychological adjustment, ah, so that, uhm, to return to the question of self-actualization of, is as the person is aware, ah, expectantly aware of what is going on with him and, ah, ah, he's consequently changing in practically every moment and moving on in complexity and so on. That's what I regard as, ah, as self-actualization. 

00:23:15
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Now, ah, in the same respect of phrases such as ideal self versus real self are used. Now, ah, how would you relate, ah, these terms to, ah, our discussion? 

00:23:35
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Notice they grew up in their attempt to, uhm, measure these self-perceptions. I may say that, ah, one is not so reluctant to use the concept of itself whether or not if I get into anything that big, ah, we can never measure it. We can never do research. Ah, that's why, uhm, William Stephenson development of the Q-technique came along at just the right moment as far as I was concerned because here was a way of getting, ah, uhm, an objective picture of this highly subjective phenomenon, the self. And, uhm, then we realized that, uhm, a person does not value, ah, every aspect to themselves, ah, and so we did asked the-- our subjects in our research to sort the, the Q cards for a picture of their self they would like to be, ah, which, ah, give the, ah, ah, picture of the ideal self as compared with the self as currently perceived. And that proved to be quite, ah, a valuable way of, ah, bringing objectivity into the study of this, ah, very ephemeral, ah, phenomenon. We get to valued self as against the currently perceived self and can make all kinds of interesting comparisons. 

00:25:05
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Pursuing a little further, ah, this whole question of self, ah, of course there are certain, ah, very important, ah, we might say almost resolutions to the human organisms must, ah, undergo of it. I wonder if you might developed what you really mean by those ideas as congruency versus incongruency. 

00:25:30
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Uhm, I think, uhm, I don't perceive about incongruence that, uhm, when a-- individuals experience he's quite discrepant from the way he has organized himself. Uhm, its common example in one of another different situation I gave before is the person who was convinced that he's intellectually inferior, uhm, and he may actually do very creative and good things that show he has that fine intellect, ah, he can't believe those. So there's a, uhm, discrepancy between the picture he has to himself and what is he actually experiencing. Uhm, and that's what we call incongruence, uhm, what we are working toward in counseling or therapy is toward a greater congruence of self and experience. So that the, uhm, ah, individual is both, ah, able to be aware of what is he experiencing, ah, which is-- means that he's not to defensively organize. He's able to be aware of even, ah, things which might changes concept of himself and can organized those into the stealth of, ah, ah, that he holds and regret to self. Uhm, then we views the term in another way to go over the same meaning but in another respect. Ah, we found that, uhm, congruence in a therapist is very important in a relationship. In other words, that it is very important for the therapist to be himself in that relationship. He too maybe an incongruent person in other ways, but it's, ah, important that in a therapeutic relationship he should, uhm, be what he is experiencing and, uhm, otherwise, he came across to the client as a little bit phony or somewhat of a facade in therapy is not nearly so likely to, ah, to take place. So, uhm, one description as given of, of what it means to be congruent in a given moment is to be aware of what's going on and you're experiencing at that moment. Ah, to be, ah, acceptant toward that experience, to be able to, ah, voice as if it's, if it's appropriate of any way to be able to express it in some, ah, ah, in some behavioral way. 

00:28:10
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Of course, ah, you introduced the notion of therapy in your answer to the last question Dr. Rogers and of course this lead you to one of the most obvious, I guess the areas of discussion. Anyway, whatever we have with Carl Rogers and this has to do of course, your very significant contributions to the area of psychotherapy. If I guess, your 1942 books, ah, sort of begins with set of say through it. But at old-age, you were talking about the non-directive psychotherapy and, ah, as time went by, you began using the term like client-centered psychotherapy. But sort of studying this evolution, ah, how did you kind of arrived at this kind of formulations? 

00:28:50
DR. CARL R. ROGERS I was, uhm, I could have guess you might be raising some question too long like that. Ah, and I was thinking about it, ah, yesterday in terms of the, of the books that I have written. Uhm, ah, it really goes back further than you, than you mention because, uhm, my book of Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child, uhm, which is really written in 1936 and '37. That was published in '39, uhm, shows where I stood at that point. I was working with children then. My whole aim was to, uhm, manipulate these conditions under which a child lived, ah, so as to improve his adjustments, uhm, the-- make a diagnostic to the child's situation. We developed a treatment plan. We brought in all of different agencies to school, in the court and whatever is needed, ah, to make sure that, that plan was carried through. So, that shows my approach to, to at least to child at that time. What is that on the whole a, a planful but basically manipulative approach. Then, uhm, you'll find traces in that book of a beginning notion of something a little more than that. A little bit more, ah, attempt to get in touch with the individuals that you're dealing with. Then, uhm, by 1942 when Counseling and Psychotherapy came out, uhm, quite little to that was still directed negatively. Don't diagnose, don't advice, don't interpret but, uhm, it did have its central theme. A notion that the, ah, potential for better health resided in the, in the client and, ah, it's certainly is quite of technique-oriented book, ah, the counselors' responses where we have a thorough it with, ah, ah, enable the client's potential to, to develop. Then, uhm, Client-centered Therapy which was written when 1949 and '50 and published in '51, uhm, they're that the hypotheses are becoming a little more, ah, sophisticated that the, uhm, counselor's, ah, basic premise was that the individual has, ah, sufficient capacity to deal with the all lowest aspects of his life which should can come into awareness. And so, the, ah, counselor endeavored to create an interpersonal situation in which the materials could come into awareness. Uhm, there was a great deal of stress in both the philosophical and attitudinal characteristics, ah, of the therapist, uhm, and, and the definite move away from techniques. Uhm, and perhaps a little bit of groping toward a closer personal relationship. Even if it was the best time I think I began to formulate the, the three conditions of, of therapy which I'll mention a little more fully in a few moment. Ah, then in 1961, when I published the On Becoming a Person that contain papers in 1953 to 1960, I guess. Uhm, the-- I'd come to recognize quite fully that the therapist must be present as a person in their relationship if, ah, therapy is to take place. It is a much more, uhm, much more an "I-Thou" kind of relationship that develops between, ah, ah, the therapist and the client. 

00:32:40
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Buber of course used these terms "I-Thou" and I notice when you're writing you have, "I'm kinda time using these terms." 

00:32:45
DR. CARL R. ROGERS I think that, uhm, some of Buber's phrases that do the best job that, ah, when there is a real timeless immediacy in the relationship when you're aware of nothing but this other person and he's aware of, of nothing but you. Ah, and there is a, ah, deep sense of communication and unity, ah, between the two of you. That's the thing that I refer to you as in "I-Thou" - 

00:33:15
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Which is in contrasts to what, in other words? 

00:33:20
DR. CARL R. ROGERS - in contrast to then, "I-It" relationship where I'm seeing you as, ah, complex object, uhm, a, ah, machines with function may have the, ah, be in this repair and certain ways it is like the, the whole, ah, ah, or the whole diagnostic look at an individual is in sharp contrast to, ah, an "I-Thou" kind of relationship. 

00:33:45
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Yes. Now, if I can put together what you said then in your earlier work, you were trying to really explore the techniques involve in this relationship and then, you began to move into really exploring the properties of this "I-Thou" relationship as I, ah, understand you correctly. Now, going back for a moment through the techniques as you were emphasizing reflection between client and, ah, counselor. How far can you reflect that without directing is it is such a, ah, disturbing thoughts that's obviously many people are perplexed by it? Have you undergone any changes yourself in how non-directive or client-centered one can really be that is will you say that today you perhaps you're qualified somewhat to this notion of being non-directive? 

00:34:30
DR. CARL R. ROGERS No, I think, I am perhaps in reach to it but not really I am qualified that I still feel that the, ah, person who should guide the client's life is the client. And then my whole philosophy in whole approach is to try to strengthen him in that, ah, uhm, way of being that, ah, he is in charge of his own life and nothing that I say is intended to, ah, ah, take that, ah, capacity, that opportunity away from him. Now, ah, it is change the respect that I would try to be aware of my own feelings too, uhm, and expect those as my feelings but without imposing them on him. Ah, even, even, ah, negative feelings I might, ah, tell a client, "I'm really bored by what you're saying." Uhm, it doesn't guide him, it does provide with some perhaps rather jolting data which he must, ah, handle in somewhere early. But, uhm, ah, I'm not telling him what he should do to avoid boring him, maybe he would just assume bore me, that's up to you. 

00:35:40
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Well, taking this kind of example, I'm sure you're-- they don't mean literally but, ah, back when you are working in your book in 1942, with clients in old-age, ah, would you have done something like this? That are actually been, ah, made this kind of comment to the, ah, the client? 

00:35:55
DR. CARL R. ROGERS No, no, no I wouldn't do that. At that time I was, uhm, quite fascinated by the discovery that people didn't have much more capacity to guide themselves, credits for. And, uhm, I became sort of purest in that, let's not, let's any of me into the situation except just an understanding of, of the client's feelings. And, uhm, and gradually realized over the years that, uhm, that rather purest approach, uhm, teach the client of, of what might be a, ah, a very close interpersonal relationship which is more, more rewarding. I might just say that, uhm, what startled me really in the change from the manipulative to an approach to one which rested its confidence in the clients, where a number of experiences, uhm, that's the most vivid one is one I think is written somewhere to. Uhm, I've been working with a mother and when the other staff members is working with her son. And, uhm, I was getting nowhere with this mother. I felt she was a rejecting mother. She tried to, ah, gently point that out, uhm, and, uhm, really we just made no progress. After a number of interviews, I said to her, "I think we both tried, but, ah, I don't think we're getting anywhere. And I would suggest that we just, ah, call it quit." And, uhm, she agreed that she didn't think we were getting very far either, so she got up, ah, started to leave the room. Then the other side of the door and said, ah, "You ever take adults for counseling here." I said, "Yes" and, ah, she said, "All right." She came back and sat right down again and began to pour out her own problems from her own point of view which is totally different from the nice case history I've gotten. And, ah, began to really work on the things that concerned her which is primarily her marriage not her son at all and, ah, that was the start of a really fruitful therapeutic relationship. And it made me realized that if I wanted to look like a smart psychologist, okay, then go ahead and diagnose, advice, interpret and so on. But if I wanted to be effective in working with people, then I might just as well recognize that they had-- this person has the capacity to deal with his own problem, get a climate where he can do it. So, that-- since that time I would say my whole effort has been focused on the kind of psychological climate that helps the individual to, ah, to resolve his problems, to develop, to grow. 

00:38:40
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS With this respect, you were, ah, going along pretty much with something pretty close to Lewin's notion of Field Theory that the behavior is a function of person interacting with the environment. Ah, were you readily affected by Lewin's work, haven't you, have you-- where were would other than that? 

00:38:55
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Not very sharply aware of it, ah, as I became aware of it, I realized certainly that I was upbraiding from, ah, Field Theory based and not from, ah, genetic, ah, theory. 

00:39:05
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Another, ah, influence that, ah, what seem to at least be there some way was, ah, the work of Otto Rank. Now, Rank of course is studying kind of, ah, time setting. He would say, well, let's, let's finish it up in so many sessions, and, that's a contrast to three to five years of, you know, of long psychoanalysis. Ah, were you influenced by Otto Rank? 

00:39:30
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Yes, I was, uhm, not so much in that aspect. I was sort of studying a time limit, but, ah, ah, with many of these other ideas of the relationship, I'm focusing more on the immediate person and so on. I was influenced primarily indirectly. Ah, some people who had, uhm, ah, work with well, with the Philadelphia school of social work which was quite Rank in its orientation. Ah, it had quite an impact on me, and then, ah, two of which brought, Otto Rank to register for a three-day seminar which was fruitful. Uhm, ah, I had sometimes said, ah, fictitiously that in those three days, I didn't think much of his theory, but I thought his therapy was very good. And, ah, he's-- and there's no doubt that the, ah, my therapy was interested, was influenced by his, ah, thinking. 

00:40:25
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Certainly to this day, I guess in, in training of counselors you would, would, I guess, still go along with his idea of the importance of genuine reflections? 

00:40:30
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Well, uhm, let me talk about the, the conditions that I feel are necessary to therapy. And I think in doing that I'll, I'll answer your, ah, questions. Ah, we've, ah, gradually built a fairly solid theory and backed it up to some I think pretty side effect of research which shows that if these conditions are not the, ah, ultimate or best statement of, ah, ah, what fosters personal growth, at least an approximation to it. And these, uhm, the three conditions that are very important to, ah, have exist in a relationship. Ah, first of all, the therapist's congruence or genuineness is ability to be a real person with the client. That I think, ah, is, ah, the most important of the three conditions. Then perhaps, uhm, second is his ability to accept the client as a separate person, uhm, without, without judging and more evaluating. It's a-- at its best, I think it's really unconditional acceptance and enable to accept you as you are. Ah, and the third, is a real empathic understanding. Now, uhm, that's of course where the term reflection that is used. If it is simply reflection, ah, that's no good, that's, that's the technique. But if it is a desire to understand emphatically, they really, ah, stand in the client's shoes and they see the world from his vantage point. Uhm, and if some of that can be communicated to a client that I do really see how you feel and understand the way you feel, uhm, that can be a most releasing kind of experience to, to find that here is a real person who really accepts and understands, uhm, sensitively and accurately just the way the world seems to me. Ah, that just seems to pull people forward. It really is a fascinating, the effect that you can have. And if it is-- that I think that enables the process of therapy to, ah, to go on. 

00:42:55
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS In your early works, of course were, ah, in a position where you have to contend with a very powerful construct that Freud developed the construct of transference, and, ah, of course, ah, his, his notion that, ah, that therapist as, ah, being perceived by this, ah, patient, ah, in terms of some early relationship with the parent and that empathy positive transference which should be love between the therapist and patient or negative transference that we hate? 

00:43:25
DR. CARL R. ROGERS The, the interesting thing about Freud's formulation is that, ah, as in so many of his formulations, there's no room for any normal feeling reaction between the two, ah, it's either transference or countertransference. But the possibility of the, ah, having a-- Koch's normal feeling of, of liking towards another person, ah, that doesn't fit into this theory. Ah, and I think it's fascinating the way he accepts them in pretty orthodox Freudian's the whole notion of transference and countertransference now has pretty well fitted out the picture. I think that the phenomenon of transference as it existed in psychoanalysis, uhm, was a learned thing, uhm, it was fostered by the reactions of the, of the analyst. 

00:44:15
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Is there a tremendous almost, ah, revolution in our whole conception of psychotherapy and obviously, you worked and exhibited those that as we having quickly move away from individual face to face therapy as you were describing at your early work. And of course, doing your own to began moving in your area group therapy very early and of course group therapy is still growing by leaps and bounds. For example, ah, we're, we're dealing with sensitivity training, the early so called a group dynamic orientation has taken on some kind of new directions and even more the whole personal growth movement, ah, moved into what we today you even call it encounter group. In terms of trying to develop this encounter you've been talking about, it seems that so as were saying, "Yes. Use every technique, tactile word what have here." How do you see yourself in regard to this whole movement? 

00:45:10
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Well, let me focus on the, uhm, encounter group aspect of it because I just, ah, consider them poignant. Uhm, and I feel then very much interested in, very much involved in. I think that, uhm, in many ways it can, ah, not only can but, in some respect has gone deeply wild and I, I, I regret that, uhm, I think that in its more what I regret is as it's more as solid aspect. It's one of the most, uhm, significant social inventions of these, ah, century, uhm, because it is a way of, ah, ah, eliminating alienation and loneliness, and getting people into better communication with one another, of helping them developed, ah, fresh insights into themselves, uhm, helping them get feedback from others, so that they perceive how they are received by others. Uhm, it, it, ah, serve a great many, ah, useful purposes. And in my own work in encounter groups, I have, ah, very much the same, ah, theory and philosophy that I've been, ah, talking about. As a group facilitator, I would try to, ah, hold much the same attitude that I was talking about as being, ah, effective in, in individual psychotherapy. And in encounter group, it helps in that in a relatively short, ah, space of time. 

00:46:45
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS And our last minute are one, what are some of the fears you have about this movement or things go and beyond the bound of the rational, ah, orientation that you've just described, ah, well, what do you, what are you think-- that there's some danger here that these officers were actually set this whole movement back seriously? 

00:47:00
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Yes. I think, ah, it's a definitely. I think that, uhm, I don't really object basically the people trying various approaches than mysticism, ah, even nude groups, if they want to. The social effects that, that will have those things to be, ah, very bad, because I think the general public may get turned off and feel that all groups are bad just as, ah, quite a number of years ago, they got turned off about progressive education, and, and that became a dirty word. And the analogy might be quite close because, uhm, uhm, public make groups, yet I'm sure that the kind of things that a an encounter group experienced does are people, that's going to continue just as progressive education with the-- as the term was no longer use, but the ideas, the sound ideas that progressive education has been upbraiding in that field ever, ever since. 

00:48:00
DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Well, Dr. Rogers, I surely want to thank you very much. Your responses are just smile and thank you. 

00:48:05
DR. CARL R. ROGERS Well, it's been very pleasant. Thank you.
