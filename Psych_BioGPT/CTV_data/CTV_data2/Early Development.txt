The Association for Specialists in Group Work Presents The Group: Early Development Dr. Rex Stockton Indiana University 

00:02:45
DR. REX STOCKTON  Welcome to our video tape series on developmental aspects of group counseling: process, leadership, and supervision. In this series you will watch members of a group go through the various stages of a therapeutic experience. From the beginning stage, or(ph) members search for structure as they break the ice and begin the process of self-disclosure and feedback, through a stormy transition phase until they resolve into a working group, and eventually move to the final stage of termination. We will also examine the growth process of the leaders. We will watch our leaders as they start with uncertainty. Perhaps wondering how the group will ever make it. You will see them intervene well and at other times with no less much ease. Yet, over time you will see them become increasingly confident of their leadership skills and behavior. As you watch, hopefully you will see yourself as a beginning group leader and through combining these learning experience with your own reading and clinical experience, you will be able to move further and with greater confidence along your path of development. In this series, you will also see excerpts from supervision sessions. This process is critical in group leader development. I will share with you some thoughts about group leader supervision later in this tape. This series will illustrate the group counseling leadership and supervision model that I have developed over the years in Indiana University. Here, the group experience last 16 weeks or approximately one semester. In our society, people often do not have the time or a financial resources to participate in long term groups. We've also found that the time limited nature of the group itself can encourage participants to work harder and more quickly on their issues. The group you'll be watching is made up of graduate students from Indiana University's Counseling Program. Their virtuoso personas that are fairly typical for the kinds of clients you are likely to be leading early in your career. While guidelines were given to the group the actual sessions were unscripted. You will see the members working on understanding themselves and their relationship with others. You will not see group members with a great deal of pathology or deep-seated personality disorders. While the group process is also very helpful for a more distressed population, this series illustrates a personal growth group model more typically seen by the beginning group leader. 

00:05:15

00:05:15
DR. REX STOCKTON  Beginning a group is a stressful experience for members therefore, pre-group planning is very important. Spend time thinking and brainstorming with your supervisor and peers about the best way to begin. 

00:05:30
Beginning Stage Leader Tasks 

00:05:30
DR. REX STOCKTON At the first meeting, group members will look to the leaders for orientation. After welcoming the members, leaders need to provide some type of optimal initial structure that will help relieve the normal stress and fear of the first session. As well as encourage disclosure at a greater depths and just cocktail party talk. We know that beginning a group is also stressful for new group leaders. Starting with the pre-planed exercise is therefore helpful to members and leaders as well. Now, let's look at a vignette of a first group session. Our leaders have chosen to begin with a dyad exercise because in the beginning it is much easier and safer to talk to one other person than an entire group. Note that the leaders are not particularly smooth in their beginning, and the group members don't self-disclose to significant depths. Yet, the important goal of breaking the ice and setting the stage for group development is accomplished. 

00:06:20
Beginning Stage: Orientation 

00:06:20
KENT  Uhm, welcome to the group. I'm glad you could all make it tonight. My name is Kent and I'm one of your co-leaders. 

00:06:40
EDDIE And I'm Eddie. I'm your, the co-leader and I'm also glad to see you all able to come in this evening. 

00:06:45
KENT  Uhm, as you know we've talked about this before ah, this is a personal growth group it'll be going on for 16 weeks. We'll be meeting uhm, a, every week for the next 16 weeks. And it's an opportunity for us to work on ah, individual issues that we have in a group context. But before we do that and, and that can be pretty, ah, pretty scary process, but before we do that uhm, we like to get to know a little bit more about each other. 

00:07:15
EDDIE There an easy way we can do that is to pair off in the two's. Ah, what we'll do is introduce your, introduce yourself to the person you're paired off with you and the person will introduce themselves to you and then we'll come back to the group and introduce your partner to the rest of the group. 

00:07:35
KENT Uh hmm. Now, way it's, it's a little less threatening to, to get to know each other in that, in that context. Uhm, in, in kinda just say your name and, and uhm, something about yourself maybe where you work or what you enjoy doing. And then, and then, uhm, maybe a li, something a little more uhm, personal than you might tell somebody, one of your co-workers or ah, an acquaintance. Something that you know, is kind of personal that, that not everybody knows about you as way of, of ah, being able to share uhm, a little more deeply than in a social context. 

00:08:10
EDDIE Any questions about that? Well, we pair off you two over there, you two, you two and you and I will pair off together. (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:08:15
EDDIE So let's meet just briefly, couple minutes of peace perhaps and then come back to the group and introduce your partner to the group. 

00:08:20
  Uh hmm.

00:11:35
EDDIE And this is Jeff. He's uhm, an assistant manager at a body shop here in town. He said he work himself up from the very beginning kinds of jobs in the body shop and he's now assistant manager of, seems to be(ph) pretty happy about that position.

00:11:55
JEFF Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:11:55
EDDIE And as before we go any further as I was sitting here trying to move all other details about Jeff... (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
 Hmm. 

00:12:00
EDDIE ...while, I was listening to everybody else... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
EDDIE ...I'd kinda like to check back around the group and make sure I got everybody's name then I probably not the only one that has a little bit of that concern with Margaret, and of course, I know Kent, Jamie, John, Doug, Katie and Jeff. 

00:12:15
DR. REX STOCKTON  So we've begun. In this vignette, you saw only one of a variety of ways to provide some initial structure so that members can begin to feel comfortable. You remember that the leaders also participated in the group exercise. They acted as a model so that the members could see what was expected. This also has the added benefit of relieving a little of the leader's stress as well. Over all, the important thing is that the leaders provide interventions to assist members as they begin to risk self-disclosing and the giving and receiving of feedback. The formation of positive group norms aids in this process. Norms by the operating procedures, the implicit and explicit assumptions that guide the group members. Leaders play an important role in the formation of group norms. One way to set norms is through group discussion. Imagine yourself with you're first group. What are some things you'd want to discuss with the members? Let's go back to our group and take a look to see how the leaders can positively influence the setting in norms. 

00:13:20
Beginning Stage: Norm Setting 

00:13:20
KENT  Okay. Well, now that we know a little more about each other and uhm, hopefully feel a little more comfortable. Uhm, one of the things we like to do early on is kind of established some rules or ah, uhm, so, some norms that we have in the group, that allow us to proceed in, in the group context when we deal with our issues as they become more and more personal. And I think one of the things that ah, of course, comes to my mind immediately is the idea of confidentiality. It's a real important ah, idea that ah, what we say here in group stays in the group and that we can share our, our innermost thoughts and feelings as, as we are comfortable to do so and, and, and be ah, free from the fear that they're gonna be talk about outside the con, (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:14:20
KENT  conta, fines as a group. 

00:14:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
JAMIE I think I have question. (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:14:25
JAMIE I, I understand the issue of confidentiality but what if you know, for those of us who are married or has significant people on our lives. What if we wanna share with them what's happening with us? (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
KENT Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:14:40
JAMIE I mean, as long as we don't bring anybody else, anybody else's name into, (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
JAMIE  or what's going on in the group. I kinda feel like I have the right to, to let my husband know what, what, what's going on with me. 

00:14:50
KENT Uh hmm. So you like to tell your husband something about what's going on in the group? 

00:14:55
JAMIE Not so much of what's going on in the group... (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
JAMIE ...but just maybe what's going on with me. 

00:15:00
JOHN Well, uhm, it sort of bothers me... (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
JOHN ...ah, that, that other people are even gonna be going, going back in, in sharing things. I, I'm, I'm single and, and, I don't, I'm not gonna take anything back to, to my spouse or anything but I, I would prefer that, that what is said here stays in here. 

00:15:20
 Hmm. 

00:15:20
KENT It sounds like it's kind of a trust issue with you, that you, that you wanna be sure that people are, are, are not gonna involve you in their conversations... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
JOHN Yeah. 

00:15:25
KENT ...and, and ah, that, that you like to let them know that. Ah, Margaret you. (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
EDDIE But you can learn that, (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
KENT Yeah. 

00:15:35
EDDIE yeah. What(ph), what... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
MARGARET Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
EDDIE ...you feel anything about it. 

00:15:35
MARGARET Well, I'm like John. I don't have any significant other in my life right now but I can understand in terms of ah, wanting to share. We're talking about this is a growth group and... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
 Hmm. 

00:15:45
MARGARET ...in order to have better understanding of yourself. I think it's important to be able to share with someone else who's important in your life and who also has an idea, you know what, what's going on with yourself. 

00:15:55
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:15:55
MARGARET I personally feel that as long as you talk about what's happening just with you. I have no problems with that. 

00:16:05
 Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:16:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
KENT So. 

00:16:05
 Hmm. 

00:16:05
EDDIE So, if I understand what we all agreeing upon is the basically what we talked about stays here within the group, but you can take it back to your significant others like, like Margaret what you were saying to other people who are important in your life and be able to share what your experience in a group is about, but also leaving out meanings(ph) and details might identify other group members. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
 Uh-huh. Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
EDDIE Is that sound most safer to you too John? 

00:16:30
JOHN Yeah. I, I think so. (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
 Uh-huh. Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
EDDIE So that we're agreeing upon here? 

00:16:30
 Uh-huh. 

00:16:30
 Hmm. 

00:16:30
JEFF Sounds good. (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
 Hmm. 

00:16:30
  Great. 

00:16:35
 Yeah. 

00:16:35
EDDIE Well, the other issues that come to my mind that, that I think is important to start as, ah, talk about as we start a group is to talk about attendance... (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
KENT (inaudible ). 

00:16:45
EDDIE ...and being here on time. Uhm, the sort of thing. We've already talked about this being a 16-week group. So what the real issue behind us has to do with this uhm, a commitment to being here for you to be able to work on your group, your issues by yourself and, and within the group as well. 

00:17:00
JOHN  Well, uhm, suppose we're late. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
JOHN I mean and we're, we're just running late. We're gonna be 10 or 15 minutes late. 

00:17:10
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
JOHN Should we still come? I mean should I still, if, if I'm gonna be late, should I still show up here? 

00:17:15
EDDIE How would the rest of you feel about that... (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
 Hmm. 

00:17:20
EDDIE ...say John or any, any of the rest of you nee, needing to coming late? Any particular reactions? 

00:17:25
JEFF Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
JOHN Well said(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
KENT Well, Margaret. Ah, excuse me John. Margaret, you were gonna say something. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
MARGARET Oh, I was just going to say that I have no problems with you know, a person being late on occasion but if it seems like it's becoming a habit, then I personally would be a little in to abide... (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
 Uh hmm, yeah. 

00:17:40
MARGARET ...upon making an effort to get here on time and I feel everyone else should. (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
KENT Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So, would, would you be able to like bring that to the group if you feel like somebody is? 

00:17:45
MARGARET Yes. (laughs) 

00:17:45
KENT Uhm, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
KENT  And, and just, just give one comment John before you ah, continue. I just, I think it's important ah, in, in a group context ah, pers, especially personal growth that, that everybody be he, make every effort to be here because a lot of the, uhm, things that we learned about ourselves and, ah, ah, happens because everybody is here week after week and, and we're able to explore issues with other people that you know, we're not, otherwise they able to do uhm, in a social situations so ah. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
EDDIE I think what Kent is talking about is not only a commitment to yourself to be here, to work on your issues... (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:18:25
EDDIE ...each week but a commitment to one another as you share parts about yourself and you hear what other people are talking about in a group. There is some commitment that we're asking for. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
KENT Right. Yeah. 

00:18:35
EDDIE Both ways at this point. 

00:18:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
JOHN So uhm, if I call and if I'm running little late I can, I can still come? (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
KENT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:18:45
JOHN I can still show up here? Okay. That's. (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
KENT That's what I hear the group is saying. 

00:18:50
JOHN Alright. 

00:18:50
KENT Uhm, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
EDDIE Is what, is, is that a group decision(ph)? (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
 In an emergency situation? 

00:18:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
 (inaudible ) concern. (crosstalk) 

00:18:57
 Uh hmm. 

00:18:57
KATIE  Should I tell you now? I might not be able to make one of the sessions at the Christmas break. (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
JEFF Hmm. 

00:19:00
KATIE I might be going home but I'll have more news on that later. 

00:19:05
JEFF Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
EDDIE Yeah, obviously, you remind us ahead of time so, so everybody else would be prepared for that as well. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
 Uh-huh. 

00:19:10
EDDIE It sounds good. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
KATIE Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
KENT Yeah. So. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
EDDIE One of the reasons we talked about these rules on the group is that it also allows you some opportunity to, to know what to expect in group. Once we talk about... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
 Uh-huh. 

00:19:20
EDDIE ...this, you know what to expect from one another, you know what time, it's time to weighing down and that the groups gonna end and so forth. So I think it makes things a little more predictable for you as well too. (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
DR. REX STOCKTON  As you've seen, norms are created early in the group's life. It is important to note that once established they're difficult to change. To help build a culture that will ultimately exert great influence. You saw the group discussed confidentiality, attendance, and promptness. 

00:19:45
Norms -focus on Here & Now -self-disclosure -feedback 

00:19:45
DR. REX STOCKTON In your group, you will also want to discuss additional norms that are relevant to your situation. Just be sure you remember, that your goal is to help create a culture with the members may interact freely and honestly. Now, let's consider goal setting. Helping each member to articulate his or her goal will assist the group in creating an agenda that will more likely lead to therapeutic change for the members. In goal setting, it is not unusual for members to be abstract, tentative or unclear. They may also state goals that are clearly unattainable during the projected life of the group. Leaders can often help members make their own goals more clear, concrete and attainable. Now, let's watch how the leaders handle this task with the group. 

00:20:30
Beginning Stage: Goal Setting 

00:20:30
KENT  I think it'd be nice if we could move on into ah, uhm, goals. Uhm, one of the reasons that you're here ah, the main reason you're here is to, is to kind of work on an issue that, that you have in your lives in a group context and uhm, so we try to kind of identify what that goal is early on in the group so we can all be aware of, of what it is you'd like to do in here and, and as we proceed maybe helped in that process ah, with that goal. 

00:21:15
EDDIE Another way to think of that the goals that you want in group are, are some of the things that you expect to get out of group. How do you expect group to be helpful for you. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:21:25
EDDIE That might be another way for you to be thinking about this. 

00:21:25
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:21:25
 I'm wondering if someone would like to start ah, you know identify a goal that they're interested in having. 

00:21:35
DOUG  Well, I guess one of the things that I see as a problem for myself is uhm, is basically the job I'm in. I mean it's, it's, it's a good job. It's ah, the business is very successful but yet, it's just not, it's just not meeting my needs. Ah, there just too many other things that are unsettling for me... (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
 Uh hmm 

00:22:00
DOUG ...and ah, so I'm just not really sure where I wanna go with rest my life.(crosstalk) 

00:22:05
 Uh hmm 

00:22:05
DOUG And uhm, so I guess that's pretty much here. 

00:22:10
KENT Uh hmm. So you like to explore maybe other options you have in your life, other things you might wanna do or... (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
DOUG Yeah. 

00:22:15
KENT ...what's going on in your life to, to make it more meaningful? 

00:22:20
DOUG Yeah, uhm, yeah. 

00:22:20
KENT Uh hmm. Good. Uh-huh. 

00:22:20
KATIE That kinda rings (inaudible ) mine because mine is trying to figure out what to do with my life. I mean, I need to make career choices now and decide if I'm gonna go on to college or more(ph) to college or get a job so... (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:22:35
KATIE ...my goals I can't figure what I want. 

00:22:40
DOUG Uh-huh. 

00:22:40
EDDIE So, you also wanting to use the group as an opportunity to help sort out and get ideas maybe about what's in the options would be for you. 

00:22:45
KATIE Exactly. 

00:22:45
EDDIE Okay. Other people? 

00:22:50
JOHN  Well, uhm, I, I just, I've got a problem. Uhm, I ah, I'm, I'm, I'm late for work a lot. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
JOHN Uhm, and I'm going ah, when I'm driving to work and it is just going on now for a couple of weeks and it, it's just getting worst. I, I, I'm, I'm late. I'm driving. I start to feel really anxious. Uhm, I get really nervous. Uhm, I, I, I'm just this past, just the, a couple of days ago, uhm, I'm there at the red light. You know on the way to work I'm late. I just was ready, just this, say forget this. I ah, I ah, I just couldn't, couldn't get to work. Uhm, and it's a, it's a problem. It, it just keeps going on and on uhm, in, in my life. It just, it started since I got this job and ah, I'd like to know what, what to do about it. I feel very uncomfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:23:55
JOHN ...ah, going to work. (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
KENT Hmm. 

00:23:55
JOHN I ca, I can't get there on time... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
JOHN ...and it's a problem. 

00:24:00
EDDIE So sounds like one of things you wanting to work on in group will had to do with talking about being late? 

00:24:05
JOHN Yeah, well it's real, it's real uncomfortable and frustrating for me, the whole work thing right now. 

00:24:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
JOHN Uhm, and it's, it's becoming a problem because I'm always a little late and ah, I don't know why. I just, I just can't seem to, to get there and when I'm there, I'm feeling uncomfortable. 

00:24:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
EDDIE So sounds like one of the things you're looking for is uhm, some ways to, to solve the problem of being late and what ever is creating some of the, the frustration, maybe being anxious about it. 

00:24:35
JOHN Yeah, they calm me down before I, I mean, I I'm driving to work and, and I'm, I get really anxious about this and I, I've got to settle down. 

00:24:45
DR. REX STOCKTON Let's stop the action for a moment. Sometimes, during the goal setting process, a member will want the group to begin focusing attention on his or her problem right away. That's John is doing now. Kent will make an intervention which reassures John that his problem is heard and that the group will deal with it at a later time. It also allows the group to return to the goal setting process. Let us take a look. 

00:25:10
KENT I can tell it's a real, a real difficulty for you and I think that we'll be able to work on that a little later when we, when we uhm, uhm, after we get around to everybody's problem. So right now I think we'd like to, maybe get to the other people in the group so we identify those problems ah, at this point. 

00:25:30
JAMIE Ah, I'm, you made me anxious just listening to you John. I mean I just, I mean I just listen to that made me nervous. Uhm, probably ah, I think my goal is just trying to decide when I, I met kind of a crossroads in my life. Uhm, and I think I came to group just to have a place to talk and a place to listen to what other people are doing but I just need a place to, to figure out what I wanna do. And basically it has to do with going back to school, going into law school but I'm afraid of what that's gonna do. It's gonna rock the boat and it's scary so that's why I'm here. 

00:26:10
 Uh-huh. 

00:26:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
JAMIE And I think my goal is just to uhm, make a decision... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
JAMIE ...and then feel some kind of peace about that decision. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
JAMIE So I'm done. 

00:26:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:26:25
MARGARET Well, (clears throat) I feel much better after listening to rest of you because ah, basically I guess that's my problem too in terms of ah, I had a lifestyle or way of doing things that I was very content with in circumstances cause it to be change and ah, so now I'm trying to I guess figure out or I have some idea what I wanna do with the rest of my life. But there are lot of things from the previous style that I'm, that I'm, that I'm content with and would like to hold on to and the conflict for me is trying to balance the two so, I think like you are probably need a sounding words, someone whose gonna look(ph), you know some people who listen to me and probably the balance ideas often. It seems that basically with the issues you are talking about that I'm gonna hear a lot about the conflict that others are having in their lives. 

00:27:15
 Uh hmm, uh-huh. 

00:27:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:27:15
EDDIE Seems like I'm hearing some, some common kinds of themes come out as we... (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
 Uh-huh. 

00:27:20
EDDIE ...talk about your goals and expectation. There's a, uhm, a real thoughtfulness about how you might be able to use the group for some new ideas to help you sort through and makes some new decisions. I'm, I think I've heard everyone says at some level, that you want some kind of resolution to a problem or uhm, a solution to some concern that, (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
EDDIE that's bothering you when you come into group at this point. 

00:27:40
KENT  Yeah, there's, ah, sort of a, a theme of change in, in each one of you. Some kind of change ah, expected change ah, ah, maybe change that, that you'd like to have happen in your life and, and kind of looking for maybe other ways of, of doing things, different things in your life so. 

00:28:00
EDDIE  As you talk about these things of change too, I think I'm hearing some ah, scaredness behind making those, those choices... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
EDDIE ...and decisions and anytime we do make changes I think there is some element of, of fear that gets involve because you don't really know what to expect. That's one reason we try to make the group in safe place for you to be able to talk about some of these concerns and to be able to share with one another the thoughts and feelings that you have. 

00:28:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:28:25
EDDIE So hopeful you'll be able to work on these goals in, in the group here and get some new ideas for yourself and makes some new choices. 

00:28:35
 Uh-huh. 

00:28:35
 Yeah. 

00:28:35
KENT I'm wondering if we have just ah, a little while left here in the group and I'm wondering if we can kind of see where everybody's at as far as how the groups going for them right now. How they're feeling about the group and uhm, anybody care to comment on what other seeing the group or how they feel about the group? 

00:29:00
JAMIE And I'm just tied(ph). I, I've never been a part of a group before and ah, and it's really uncomfortable. It's doesn't have anything to do with you guys. It just, this is really hard to do. 

00:29:10
  Uh-huh 

00:29:15
JAMIE Uhm, I feel like it's gonna be beneficial but its hard for me, (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:29:20
JAMIE it feels really uncomfortable. (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:29:20
JAMIE So that's what I meant with that. 

00:29:20
KENT  Uh-huh. 

00:29:25
EDDIE And thanks for sharing that Jamie 'coz I'm sure that if you feel that uncomfortable wasn't easy to say that either. 

00:29:25
JAMIE  Yeah, I know. (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
 Yeah. 

00:29:30
JAMIE I know it wasn't but. 

00:29:30
KENT Alright, how about somebody else? 

00:29:35
MARGARET Well, (clears throat), it was really uncomfortable with the idea of starting and yet ah, after hearing some of the other concerns and realizing as you said I guess it's common threat. 

00:29:50
 Uh-huh. 

00:29:50
MARGARET I feel a little better, I mean I'm still ah, you know, still got a little butterflies but I feel better... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
 Uh hmm 

00:29:55
MARGARET ...because I recognize that we all do there is, that I'm gonna benefit from this even if I don't resolve whatever issues I'm trying to work on it, (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
 Uh hmm 

00:30:00
MARGARET that there will be some growth. 

00:30:05
 Uh-huh. 

00:30:05
MARGARET So I feel good about that. 

00:30:05
JEFF  Well, like I said, in early, I'm willing to commit myself to this. (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:30:15
JOHN Well I, you know, I'm a little nervous. Uhm, I, I don't know what you, you, each of you thinks of me. You know, I just, I sit here and, and go on about my, my problem that I'm having and I have no idea what ah, (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:30:30
JOHN you know what you think. 

00:30:30
 Uh-huh. 

00:30:30
JOHN  So I, I guess I feel little uhm, I'm nervous about that and apprehensive about... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
 Uh-huh. 

00:30:40
JOHN ...about maybe what, what's going to happen. I don't know. 

00:30:40
 Uh-huh. 

00:30:40
EDDIE  I hope in some future sessions here you'll be able to get that kind of feedback from other group members about what they think and, and for you to be able to, to solicit that from other members. 

00:30:55
 Ah, uh-huh. 

00:30:55
JOHN Yeah. 

00:30:55
KATIE Along with that, I'm little excited to come back again just that I can get the advice or like(ph) even help give advice. 

00:31:00
  Uh-huh. 

00:31:05
KATIE Just hear, you have to say. 

00:31:05
DOUG Well, I'm guess (inaudible ) through might to a sense with apprehension in that too. And ah, I, you know, I hate to keep harping on the same thing... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
 Uh hmm 

00:31:15
DOUG ...but ah, I'm just so unclear as to what's going in here and, and it seems like we've got such a diverse variety of people that I'm not sure huh, (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
 Uh-huh. 

00:31:20
DOUG  what really is gonna happen here, (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:31:25
DOUG Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
KENT I'm wondering how it's going for you tonight? 

00:31:25
DOUG  You know, it's, it's, it's nice to meet everyone and, and have that interaction. I'm not sure. I'm just at a lost as to what we're gonna do here and what we're gonna be able to accomplish... (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
 Uh hmm 

00:31:40
DOUG ...with one another. (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
 Uh hmm 

00:31:40
DOUG Uhm, it's been interesting. 

00:31:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:31:45
DR. REX STOCKTON The leaders have brought the group back into the hearing now to see how the first session has been for members. As often as the case, they are hearing mixed feelings. Let's watch and see how Eddie handles the members' uneasiness. 

00:31:55
MARGARET That's it. 

00:31:55
EDDIE A lot of the fears and apprehension that you're talking about this evening. What this experience has been like for you are very common. 

00:32:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:00
EDDIE  Uhm, it would, it would almost be odd if it wasn't happening ah, for all of you. You are, you are all strangers before you came in here like uhm, Doug said. You least know one anothers' names now. You have some inkling of, some of the concerns that each of you have brought up that ah, you're not alone in this process which you may have some different kind of concern.(crosstalk) 

00:32:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
EDDIE So I think the apprehension are, are very common and seem to be present to some degree in all of us. 

00:32:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:32:25
KENT  Well, with that I think we'll close for tonight and ah, be looking forward to seeing each of you back here next week and we'll continue ah, with ah, talking about our goals and, and expectations for the group and, (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
 Uh-huh. 

00:32:40
KENT  and ah, and start realizing those expectations. 

00:32:45
 Yeah. 

00:32:45
KENT  Okay. 

00:32:50
DOUG See you. 

00:32:50
 Okay. 

00:32:50
Dr. Rex Stockton Indiana University 

00:32:50
DR. REX STOCKTON As you can see, Eddie did a nice job of helping to normalize the member's fears and concerns. Our group is now on its way. In our training program leaders receive feedback on their leadership immediately after the group session in a one-hour supervision period. I believe that it is the goal of the supervision to facilitate the beginning leaders learning a process called perceiving, selecting and risking. First, leaders have to perceive what is occurring in order to learn how to understand what's going on, leaders need a broad range of knowledge about groups. It is important to read deeply into the group counseling literature. Observe groups and participate as members. These encourages the development of a foundation of actual and vicarious experience. Yet, even with these knowledge new leaders still need to make the connection between what they know, what is happening in the group and what they can effectively do about it. Therefore, leaders need to be able to mentally generate and select an appropriate response. Here clinical practice, thoughtful reflection and supervisory feedback are the key. Finally, leaders must gain the confidence needed to risk trying out appropriate group interventions. I found over the years that no matter how bright they are, how much reading they've done or how much individual counseling experience they have, beginning leaders are highly anxious. It is the supervisor's job to help reduce and defuse this anxiety. 

00:34:15
Risking - reduce anxiety - feedback - reflection - continued practice 

00:34:15
DR. REX STOCKTON While at the same time giving the leaders accurate feedback. Giving positive feedback before negative feedback is very effective in helping leaders relax enough to be able to reflect and make sense out of their experience so that they can feel more confident in their next group session. These components of perceiving what's happening, selecting and developing a strategy and having the confidence to risk intervening or of course an inextricably intertwined. In our program we've also found that a co-leadership model is beneficial for leaders in training. Having a supportive partner on the journey is helpful. While one leader can focus upon the current interaction, the other can scan the group and be ready with the an intervention when needed. There are of course potential problems with co-leadership, for the most part this revolve around communication between leaders thus, it is critical for leaders to learn how to communicate effectively with one another as well as with the members. This can often be facilitated in supervision. Now let's take a look at an excerpt from the supervision following the first group session. 

00:35:20
Beginning Stage: Supervision 

00:35:20
DR. REX STOCKTON  Okay that about wraps it up... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
KENT Hmm. 

00:35:35
DR. REX STOCKTON ...we could see you fo, your finishing and we know how that, how that, (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
DR. REX STOCKTON How that completed. So much for the replay. 

00:35:40
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
DR. REX STOCKTON Well, let me look between you guys, I'm ask you which ah, wanna be most start-off and, and sort to comment on what was like for you here in the session. 

00:35:50
KENT Hmm. 

00:35:50
EDDIE Okay. 

00:35:50
KENT Well, (laughs) I start-off since I did it, it at the beginning uhm, somewhat more relax than I did at the beginning of, of the session I'm, I'm still surprise that no matter how many groups you lead ah, with, when you start one it's just always a little apprehensive in, in getting started this a little more difficult than you anticipate. 

00:36:10
DR. REX STOCKTON It is a little tough as I suspect... (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
DR. REX STOCKTON ...it was for you to feel. 

00:36:15
EDDIE Uh hmm, I was feeling really anxious getting started. 

00:36:15
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm, hmm, uhm, 

00:36:15
KENT After, after we got going I think, it's, it was going pretty well on and so I was pleased with way ah, you know dyad exercise went and they were able introduce themselves and you know... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:36:30
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
KENT ...pretty active group. 

00:36:30
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:36:30
DR. REX STOCKTON Seem to me that you ah, both of you came in pretty well balancing your, your role as leaders... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:36:40
DR. REX STOCKTON ...so that the, the members got a sense that there was a shared leadership... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
KENT  Uh-huh. 

00:36:45
DR. REX STOCKTON ...parts for it. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:36:45
EDDIE From them to me. 

00:36:45
DR. REX STOCKTON Yeah. You have a whole set of issues there. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:36:45
DR. REX STOCKTON  Ah, for sure. (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
DR. REX STOCKTON Not everybody's brought in to ah, being commited yet, (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
KENT Right. 

00:36:50
DR. REX STOCKTON  although you spent quite a bit of time of involving people and I thought you did a good job of letting them take part in getting some consensuses as to how the group ought to be. (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:37:00
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:37:00
DR. REX STOCKTON  What about the goals? You have a sense of your group now? 

00:37:05
KENT  Well the, there's a ah, kind of pervasive theme about change and, and the fear of change and, and some are uhm, expecting to change somewhere on the, on the beginning of, of changing their lives or whatever. 

00:37:25
DR. REX STOCKTON Okay. That's surprising. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
EDDIE That, that my sense to that there did seem to be a kind of universal theme among them that, that there seems to be some uhm, there, there's sort of ah, choice points in their life to be making... (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm, (inaudible ) 

00:37:36
EDDIE ...some career changes or other kinds of life changes... (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
EDDIE ...and somehow there all seem to connected in one way or another with people... (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
EDDIE ...I was, that's in some way seems if I make it easier for the group to feel more connected. 

00:37:45
DR. REX STOCKTON Right. 

00:37:45
KENT There's seem to be the idea that ah, that uhm, changes is pretty scary for them. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
KENT And I'm not quite sure exactly how they wanna go back doing that and then, and, and I felt a little uncomfortable with that the kind of well ah, wait and see attitude, (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
KENT ...and sometimes you get a little more after at the end of session your tense to be a little more ah, feeling of uhm, not being so nervous... (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:38:10
KENT  and, and that was not quite evident here. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15

00:38:30
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:38:30
EDDIE ...Doug, that resistance you talked about that it's almost resistance to owning the responsibility... (crosstalk)

00:38:39
KENT Uh hmm. (crosstalk)

00:38:50
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
EDDIE ...but I think Kent and I have balance each other pretty well and uhm, I, you made some really good comments I was, kinda go on blanks sitting here watching this I forgot now what it was ah, at the beginning you made a comment to ah, a group member that I wanna let gee... (crosstalk)

00:39:30
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
KENT ...when I'm little stuck in and so I think the balance really helps in, in doing that allowing... (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
KENT ...each other to support uhm, the other in, in the on going process of the group. 

00:39:45

00:39:50
DR. REX STOCKTON You've gotten started, (crosstalk) 

00:39:50

00:39:55
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:39:55

00:40:00
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
DR. REX STOCKTON ...ah, there's not as much expectation for success as sometimes happens and at the same time however people are articulating their problems pretty well, (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
DR. REX STOCKTON so what are you gonna do next time to move that along. 

00:40:10
DR. REX STOCKTON  In our continuing supervisions session we critic the interventions the leaders made and discuss points in time, where interventions to would have been appropriate but were not made. We also talked about the things they would need to do to facilitate the group as it continuous to the orientation phase. We discussed the need to make reflective process statements that would enable the members to look more deeply into themselves and their issues. Finally, I encourage them to begin risking a little more to take the insights they had during the session and translate them into active interventions. In our next tape, we'll talk more about the need for leader planning as we look at the rockyroad of transition that all groups must travel to reach a working stage. See you then.
