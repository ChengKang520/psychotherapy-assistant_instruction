Clinical Diagnosis and Assessment with Asian Americans: Cultural Validity and Measurement Equivalence Frederick T.L. Leong, Ph.D. Zornitsa Kalibatseva, M.A. Department of Psychology Michigan State University Paper presented at the 2013 MSU Symposium on Multicultural Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan October 25-26, 2013 

00:00:00
Clinical Diagnosis and Assessment • In this two part presentation, we will first discuss clinical diagnosis of Asian Americans from the perspective of threats to cultural validity. • In the second part, we will discuss the challenges of clinical assessment and psychological testing with Asian Americans from the theoretical framework of measurement equivalence. 

00:00:00
Importance of Clinical Diagnosis • Virtually every school of psychotherapy considers diagnosis and assessment an important first step in the therapy process. • Indeed it has been argued that clinical diagnosis is of critical importance since appropriate treatment depends on correct diagnosis. • Yet given the significant number of problems associated with the clinical diagnosis of psychopathology, the value of the diagnostic process in cross-cultural psychotherapy has been quite controversial (e.g., Adebimpe, 204; Eap, Gobin, Ng, & Nagayama Hall, 2010; Malgady, 1996, Westermeyer, 1985). 

00:00:00
Concept of Cultural Validity • Not unlike the concept of population validity (Bracht & Glass, 1968; Breland, 1978; Messick, 1975), it can be argued that cultural validity is an important corollary to psychometric validities (e.g., face, construct, predictive, and concurrent). • The issue of cultural validity is concerned with the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and assessment for culturally-different populations (e.g., cultural, racial or ethnic minorities).

00:00:00
Threats to Cultural Vadlidity • Our current presentation of threats to cultural validity in diagnosis will be published in a chapter in the forthcoming volume by Zane, Bernal, & Leong on Culturally Informed Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology (APA Books) • Borrowing from Campbell and Stanley's (1966) concept of threats to validity, the lack of cultural validity in clinical diagnosis can also be conceptualized in terms of multiple threats to validity. • These threats to cultural validity in diagnosis are due largely to a failure to recognize or a tendency to minimize cultural factors in clinical diagnosis. 

00:00:00
Threats to Cultural Validity • Our review of the literature suggests that there are several factors which may serve as the sources of threats to cultural validity. These factors include: • (a) pathoplasticity of psychological disorders • (b) cultural factors influencing symptom expression • (c) therapist bias in clinical judgement • (d) language capability of the client • (e) inappropriate use of clinical and personality tests

00:00:00
Threat 1: Pathoplasticity of Psychological Disorders • As formulated by Westermeyer (1985), the concept of pathoplasticity of psychological disorders is based on the variability in symptoms, course, outcome, and distribution of mental disorders among cultural groups. He provides several examples of this pathoplasticity. • First, concomitants of schizophrenia vary widely from one culture to another and even among ethnic groups in a single country, with differences mainly involving the content, severity, or relative frequency of such symptoms as withdrawal, volubility, agitation, compliance, and paranoia. 

00:00:00
Pathoplasticity of Psychological Disorders • Second, the pathoplasticity of non-psychotic disorders is illustrated by the relative distribution of depression, conversion reaction, anxiety, somatoform disorder, and obsession-compulsion which differs from one culture to another. • The third example of cross-cultural pathoplasticity is the better outcome of schizophrenia in developing countries than in developed countries.

00:00:00
Pathoplasticity of Psychological Disorders • Fourth, it is possible that certain psychopathological states may be represented by different diagnoses in different cultures. • The threat to cultural validity in diagnosis comes from a failure to recognize the cultural plasticity often associated with various forms of psychopathology. • Different studies have also demonstrated this pathoplasticity of psychiatric disorders among Asian-Americans.

00:00:00
Examples of Pathoplasticity • One example regarding the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia among Chinese comes from Berk and Hirata (1973) historical analysis of hospital records of the Chinese in California from 1855-1955. • They found that there was "an increase in the diagnosis of 'paranoia' where the rate jumped from 3% to 9%. • Upon further analysis, it was noted that this rise was immediately following the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act and outbreaks of violence directed against the Chinese. The rate during the period of exclusion and persecution rose and then gradually diminished to negligible proportions" (p. 164). • Thus, it seems that political experiences of the oppressed cultural minorities may also affect their patterns of psychopathology

00:00:00
Threat 2: Cultural Factors Influencing Symptom Expression • Do cultural factors also influence the diagnosis of Asian-Americans? There are some studies that suggest that this may be the case. • As an example of how ethnic origin may influence symptom expression, Enright and Jaeckle (1963) examined the behavioral patterns of Japanese and Filipino patients with schizophrenia at the Hawaii State Hospital and found that Japanese patients expressed more depression, withdrawal, and disturbance in thinking. • Filipino patients, on the other hand, exhibited more overt disturbance of behavior and had more delusions of persecution. 

00:00:00
Cultural Factors Influencing Symptom Expression • In another study of how culture may influence the manifestation of symptoms among Asian-Americans, Katz, Sanborn and Gudeman (1969) provided an example of inter-group differences. • They studied the descriptions of Japanese and White patients with acute schizophrenia before hospital admission and during their hospital stay. • Before hospitalization, the Japanese were described as more socially obstreperous, nervous, and hyperactive than the Whites. Once in the hospital, the behaviors changed. The Whites were rated as more excited and disturbed than the Japanese. 

00:00:00

Once in the hospital, the behaviors changed. The Whites were rated as more excited and disturbed than the Japanese. 

00:00:00
Cultural Factors Influencing Symptom Expression • Pang's (1990) study on Hwabyung provided an example of the tendency to somatize psychological symptoms among Asian Americans. This is a culture-bound syndrome in which suppressed emotions manifest themselves physically. • Chinese outpatients were found to report more depressive somatic symptoms in spontaneous report and structured interviews, while Euro-Canadian outpatients reported significantly more depressive affective symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, guilt) in all three assessment modalities (Ryder et al., 2008).

00:00:00
Threat 3: Therapist Bias in Clinical Judgement • Therapist bias is the third source of threat to cultural validity in clinical diagnosis. • Racial or ethnic differences may affect therapist clinical judgment and assessment such that a therapist may over-pathologize a culturally different client (Whaley, 1997). • Problems of misdiagnosis due to therapist bias have been observed with African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans (Adebimpe, 1984; Flaskerud & Hu, 1992; Malgady, 1983).

00:00:00
Therapist Bias in Clinical Judgment • An analog study by Li-Repac (1980) provides additional support for Tseng and McDermott's (1981) finding that the degree of familiarity with the patient's cultural background may influence the diagnostic process. • Li-Repac had five White and five Chinese-American therapists rate the same Chinese and White clients on a videotaped interview on several dimensions. 

00:00:00
Therapist Bias in Clinical Judgment • She found that the White therapists were more accurate in predicting self-descriptive responses of White clients than of Chinese clients. • More importantly, she found that the White therapists rated the Chinese clients higher on the "depression/inhibition" dimension and lower on the "social poise/interpersonal capacity" dimension than the Chinese-American therapists. • Moreover, the Chinese-American therapists judged the White clients to be more severely disturbed than did the White therapists. 

00:00:00
Threat 4: Language Capability of the Client • Language capability of the client is another source of threat to cultural validity in clinical diagnosis. • Another language problem in clinical diagnosis is the use of interpreters and its effects on diagnostic evaluations with Asian-Americans (Marcos, 1979) • Yakushko (2010) examined the personal and professional factors related to positive and successful clinical care with limited English proficiency individuals. The results suggested that key characteristics of both therapists and interpreters are being flexible, open to learning, and attentive to nuances. 

00:00:00

The results suggested that key characteristics of both therapists and interpreters are being flexible, open to learning, and attentive to nuances. 

00:00:00
Language Capability of the Client • As pointed out by Leong (1986), there are several ways in which language may serve as a barrier to effective therapeutic communication. • Asian-Americans who speak little or no English may be misunderstood by their therapists (Chein & Yamamoto, 1982; D. Sue, 1981; S. Sue & Morishima, 1982). • Their bilingual background could also result in their being perceived as uncooperative, sullen, and negative (S. Sue & D. Sue, 1972). • As indicated by Shuy (1983), the use of dialects or non-standard English may interfere with the effective exchange of information, or worse, stimulate bias in the therapist performing the evaluation. 

00:00:00
Language Capability of the Client • Language capability is also relevant to diagnosis if the therapist and client do not attach the same meanings and connotations to words used in diagnosing the patient's problems. • Imada (1989) compared the Japanese equivalents of "anxiety" ("Fu-an"), "fear" ("Kyo-fu"), and "depression" ("Yu-utsu") for their connotative meanings. The Japanese experience of "Fu-an" seemed more psychological than physical and overlapped little connotative meaning with "anxiety". Both "anxiety" and "depression" were reported as more physical experiences than "Fu-an" and "Yu-utsu" 

00:00:00
Clinical Assessment and Psychological Testing • Leong & Kalibatseva (in press) identified a fifth source of threat to cultural validity in diagnosis and assessment. • This threat involves the inappropriate use of clinical and personality tests with racial and ethnic minorities. • Whereas the first four threats are more relevant to clinical diagnosis, this fifth threat is specific to the use of clinical tests and assessment tools. 

00:00:00
Inappropriate Use of Clinical and Personality Tests • Although there is a convergence of data from many studies indicating that Asian-Americans have more neurotic and disturbed personality profiles on objective self-report measures, the results of these tests still need to be interpreted with a great deal of caution for several reasons. • First, most of these measures were developed and normed on White samples. They were designed to be predictive for whites and their predictive validity for other ethnic and cultural groups needs to be independently established. 

00:00:00
Inappropriate Use of Clinical and Personality Tests • Second, as pointed out by Sue and Morishima (1982) and Uba (1994), the majority of cross-cultural personality studies have been conducted on college students, mainly from Hawaii, and usually by a handful of the same investigators. • Third, although promising, only a few of the clinical-diagnostic instruments have been translated into Asian languages 

00:00:00
Inappropriate Use of Clinical and Personality Tests • Therefore, in using these personality and diagnostic tests with Asian-Americans, there is a need to recognize that there are important cross-cultural differences in definitions of mental illness and mental health, and that there are indeed "many ways of being human" (Tyler, Sussewell & Williams, 1985). • Clinicians who use the existing diagnostic and personality tests to diagnose Asian-American patients without being aware of these issues and limitations may well be arriving at culturally invalid diagnoses. 

00:00:00
Cross-Cultural Reliability and Validity in Assessment • Reliability and validity are the major criteria for good measurement in Psychology. • In cross-cultural research, there is the added requirement of evaluating the cross-cultural reliability and validity of our measures. • The concept of measurement equivalence has become the primary scheme for evaluating the cross-cultural validity of our measures. • Related to our current discussion, the International Test Commission has published important guidelines for adapting test for use across cultures: http://www.intestcom.org/itc_projects.htm/ Guidelines on Adapting Tests 

00:00:00
Measurement Equivalence • Berry (1969, 1980) has provided a critical review of measurement equivalence issues in cross-cultural research. • Conceptually, he argued that meaningful comparison of two phenomena presupposes the same underlying dimension. • Therefore, comparison requires dimensional identity which in turn needs to be established through demonstration of universality or equivalence. • Measurement Non-Equivalence would serve as a threat to cross-cultural validity.

00:00:00
Types of Measurement Equivalent • Whereas authors such as T.P. Johnson (1998) have identified over 50 types of measurement equivalence, most cross-cultural researchers subscribe to these four major types of measurement equivalence: • Linguistic • Conceptual • Functional • Psychometric (previously called Metric) 

00:00:00
Types of Measurement Equivalence • Linguistic Equivalence (or Translation equivalence) is concerned with whether the words carry the same meaning and is associate with the same referent across cultures (e.g., ishin-denshin). • Functional equivalence may be established by showing that two or more behaviors in different cultures are functionally related to similar problems (e.g., Marriage) • Conceptual equivalence may be established by demonstrating across cultures the equivalence of meaning of a concept or construct representing a set of behaviors (e.g., Psychotherapy or Posse) • Psychometric equivalence may be shown if psychometric properties of two sets of data are the same for different cultural groups (e.g., factorial invariance, scalar equivalence).

00:00:00
Linguistic Equivalence: Back Translation Method • Linguistic equivalence is mainly concerned with translation of psychological measures from one language into another for use in another culture. • Simple translation is not an adequate procedure. • Over the years, the Back Translation Method has become the "standard procedure" and technique of choice in cross-cultural research (Brislin, 1970; 1980). • The method involves 4 steps: (a) Translating an original instrument from Language A into Language B by someone with expertise in both languages, (b) The translated instrument which is now in Language B is then "back" translated into Language A by a separate individual with expertise in both languages. 

00:00:00
Linguistic Equivalence: Back Translation Method • In the third step, (c) The back-translated version in Language A is checked against the original version which is also in Language A for accuracy. • In the final step, (d) Problems of inaccuracy and distorted meaning identified in step 3 is resolved by consultation with the translators on an item-by-item basis until an acceptable level of linguistic equivalence is accomplished in Language B. • Through this back translation method, an acceptable version of the instrument in Language B is then used in the cross-cultural research 

00:00:00
Linguistic Equivalence: Examples • Mimura & Griffiths (2008) validated the Japanese version of the Perceived Stress Scale - Followed the ITC guidelines (van de Vijever & Hambleton, 1996) - Used forward-backward translation procedure - Japanese and British couples were asked to seperately translate the scale into Japanese and discuss conceptual, semantic and content equivalence - Single version based on all translations and back-translate to English - English native speakers compared original to back-translation scale - Changed any detected distortions 

00:00:00
Conceptual Equivalence: • In general, conceptual equivalence is more complex to evaluate and establish than linguistic equivalence. • This may account for the lack of a standard procedure as in the back translation method for linguistic equivalence. • However, it would still be useful in promoting sound cross-cultural research in identifying some best practices in tackling conceptual equivalence. 

00:00:00
Conceptual Equivalence • A crude but common approach to conceptual equivalence has been for researchers to use regression methods to evaluate if regression parameters of the criteria are the same across cultural groups. • Although being economic and simple, the differences in subject variability and measure reliability may lead to fluctuations in parameters that are difficult to disentangle. 

00:00:00
Conceptual Equivalence • To evaluate conceptual equivalence, Jean-Claude Usunier has recommended that we use multiple source and target languages and to allow for de-centering in the translation process (Campbell and Werner, 1970). • Researchers should start from a rather broad conceptual area which is almost etic because it corresponds to common problems in all languages/cultures. • The procedure then consists in asking native speakers of the languages and cultures concerned to elicit key-words related to the broad conceptual area as in cognitive mapping (Eden, 1988). 

00:00:00
Conceptual Equivalence: Examples • Laungani (1996) warned against etic-based measurements of stress and discussed stress in traditional Indian culture from an emic perspective • Stress may be perceived in relation to two indigenous concepts, Klesha - "life's unavoidable and inevitable vicissitudes" (p.31) and Dukha - "the range of sorrowful experiences which individuals go through in the course of their interactions with the world around" (p.31). 

00:00:00
Functional Equivalence • If a construct from one culture serves a different or additional function in another culture, then functional equivalence becomes a problem in cross-cultural studies. • Functional equivalence in cross-cultural studies is also related to Cronbach and Meehl's concept of a normological network of relations supporting construct validity. • A measure is functionally equivalent if both the nature and pattern of relationships between the target measure and various constructs in the normological network is similar across cultures (e.g., nudity is strongly associated with embarrassment in Culture A but not Culture B as an example of the lack of functional equivalence). 

00:00:00
Functional Equivalence • The assessment of functional equivalence of measures can occur in three ways: • (a) in a preventative approach that serves as a pre-requisite for cross-culture comparisons, • (b) cross-cultural criterion-related and concurrent validity studies and meta-analysis of effect sizes of those studies across cultures, and • (c) as a program of research in itself. 

00:00:00
Psychometric Equivalence • Cross-cultural studies should evaluate metric equivalence by comparing means, standard deviations, and internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas) across samples. • Using the measurement model within SEM, such studies should conduct confirmatory factor analysis to determine the factorial invariance of the instrument. • Barbara Byrne has conducted a series of illustrative studies using indices of factorial invariance in various cross-cultural samples. 

00:00:00
Psychometric Equivalence • Good fit items should be viewed as potentially (pending replications) representing "etic loading" in measures where as poor fit items should be used as clues for possible "emic loading" that bears further exploration. • Poor fit items should be identified for further research into possible issues in Conceptual equivalence (e.g., "Sleepy" loads in different factor in Five Factor Model of personality for Japanese). • Similar to meta-analysis which identifies effect sizes across studies, we need to cummulate cross-cultural studies of instruments in order to create a data base of metric equivalence of these instruments (e.g. measurement models within SEM). 

00:00:00
Psychometric Equivalence • According to Hui and Triandis (1985), the Item Response Theory (IRT) method represents a more recent approach to measurement equivalence in cross-cultural research. • Item and scalar equivalence can be assessed by examining item characteristic curves in different cultures. • Two methods may be used: (a) Use bilinguals to respond to both versions of the same scale; and (b) use the same scale on two different populations. • Mallinckrodt and Wang (2004) has recommended a third method, the Dual Language Split Half (DLSH) method where bi-lingual participants complete an instrument consisting of half the items in Language A and half in Language B. 

00:00:00
Psychometric Equivalence: Chinese Version of BDI-II • Using a Rasch model to examine the factorial structure of the BDI-II-C revealed two dimensions (i.e., somatic and cognitive-affective items) in a sample of 2,095 Taiwanese high school students (14- 18 years old; Wu & Chang, 2008) • A recent study of 2,922 Taiwanese adolescents (13- 18.5 years old) found that overall raw scores of the two subscales were not influence by differential item functioning across genders suggesting the use of total raw scores (Wu, 2010). • Anther study found that BDI-II-C items were invariant across Hong Kong and American adolescents (Byrne, Stewart, Kennard, & Lee, 2007). The investigators also found an internal consistency coefficient of .83 in their Hong Kong sample. 

00:00:00
Normative Equivalence • Cross-cultural psychologists such as Berry have tended not to discuss normative equivalence under the measurement equivalence framework. • This is most likely due to the fact that normative equivalence is more closely linked to clinical utility (not a central psychometric issue) and professional practice. • On the other hand, normative equivalence is probably the form of equivalence that will be most familiar and understandable to professional psychologists. 

00:00:00
Research and Practice Implications • The concept of cultural validity and threats to cultural validity in clinical diagnosis and assessment needs to be incorporated into our training programs to counter the client uniformity myths and color-blind assumptions. • Cross-cultural competence in diagnosis with Asian Americans requires clinicians to learn about the culture-specific aspects of Asian Americans' communication styles (e.g., respect for authority and hierarchy, favoring of indirect and non-verbal forms of communication, etc.)

00:00:00
Research and Practice Implications • Clinicians need to become familiar with the challenges associated with measurement equivalence when testing culturally different clients and patients. • When reviewing and interpreting the results of clinical assessments, it would be important to evaluate potential problems associated with the lack of conceptual, functional or linguistic equivalence in our measures and instruments. 

00:00:00
Research and Practice Implications • More psychometric equivalence studies are clearly needed regarding the nature and impact of cultural biases in our cultural tests. • Whereas there have been significant advances in tackling linguistic and psychometric equivalence problems, we need greater attention to how we may address problems created by the lack of conceptual and functional equivalence in clinical diagnosis and assessment. • These different types of measurement equivalence are interconnected. 

00:00:00
Research and Practice Implications • Quite often researchers focus so much on psychometric equivalence without realizing the contributing role of conceptual and functional equivalence to the former. • NIH has funded cultural adaptations studies regarding treatment but not the cultural adaptations of the clinical tools that guide these interventions. 

00:00:00
Research and Practice Implications • Regarding normative equivalence, since the terms of the majority of personality and diagnostic tests were established with predominantly White samples, it would be important to remember that certain clinical elevations or low scores may be associated with cultural differences rather than psychopathology. • Thus, instruments without established measurement equivalence for other cultural groups need to be interpreted with caution. 

00:00:00
Research and Practice Implications • We need to tackle the wide-spread use of culturally inappropriate norms in our field and generate guidelines for handling challenges associated with the lack of normative equivalence. • We need more studies to establish culturally appropriate norms and cut-off scores for clinical instruments and recommendations on how to generate and use local norms.

ZORNITSA KALIBATSEVA, M.A. Um, so I will be presenting today on clinical diagnosis, um, and assessment with Asian Americans, cultural validity and measurement equivalence. So the clinical diagnosis, um, and assessment, um, process that I'll be talking about will be, um, presented in two parts in this presentation. Um, in the first part um, I'll talk about diagnosis from the perspective of threats to cultural's, cultural validity, and in the second part um, I'll discuss the challenges of clinical assessment in psychological testing with Asian Americans from the theoretical framework of measurement equivalence. So virtually every school of psychotherapy considers diagnosis and assessment an important first step in the therapy process, and indeed um, it has been argued that clinical diagnosis is of critical importance, since appropriate treatment depends on how correct our diagnosis is, and yet, given the significant number of problems associated with um, clinical diagnosis of psychopathology um, the value of the diagnostic process um, in cross-cultural psychotherapy has been quite controversial, and um, from the previous two presentations, you also, um, were hearing about quite a few controversies that come up, um, during the diagnostic process with African Americans and Latino clients. So for, for those of who have heard Fred speak, he speaks really fast during presentations, so I'm trying, I'm going to try to speak fast as well to make sure that I can cover all of the science, um, but not unlike the concept of population validity, um, it can be argued that cultural validity is an important corollary to psychometric validities, so we often talk about, um, psychometric validity, um, in terms of phase validity and construct validity and predictive and concurrent validity, and so borrowing from this concept, um, we're extending this to cultural validity, and this issue of cultural validity is concerned with the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and assessment for culturally different populations, so cultural, um, racial and ethnic minorities, in this case. So our current, um, presentation of threats to cultural validity and diagnosis will be published, um, in a, in the forthcoming volume by, um, Nolan Zane, Guillermo Bernal and, um, Fred Leong, and um, the book is titled Culturally Informed Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and it's part of the APA Books series. Borrowing from Campbell and, um, Stanley's concept, um, to threats, to validity, the lack of validity in clinical diagnosis can also be conceptualized, um, in terms of multiple threats to validity, so these threats to cultural validity and diagnosis are, um, largely due to a failure to recognize or a tendency to minimize cultural factors in clinical diagnosis, so as um, Fred often repeats in the cross-cultural psychotherapy class that, um, he's teaching, there's typically two ways in which you can, um, do things (ph)from, with culture: you can either over-empha-, emphasize, um, culture or under-emphasize culture, um, and this is where we would run, um, into, um, threats to the cultural validity in diagnosis, so in our review of the literature, um, there have been several factors that we have identified which may serve as a source to um, as a source, as sources of threats to cultural validity, and these factors include the pathoplasticity of psychological disorders, or how they may, um, present differently, cultural factors influencing, um, symptom expression. Um, so this, an example of this would be what symptoms are emphasized in specific presentations, therapist's bias in clinical judgment, language capability of the client, which can also um, impact the cultural validity and inappropriate use of clinical and personality tests, and I will talk about each of these threats to cultural validity sequentially in more detail, so the first threat to cultural validity, the pathoplasticity of psychological disorders, um, this was formulated by Westermeyer, um, this concept of pathoplasticity of psychological disorders and is based on the variability and symptoms, course, outcome and distribution of mental disorders among cultural groups and Westermeyer provides several examples of this pathoplasticity, so the first example is that concomitants of schizophrenia vary wildly from one culture to another, and even among ethnic groups in a single country with differences mainly involving the content, severity or relevant frequency of such symptoms as withdrawal, volubility, agitation, compliance and paranoia, so um, basically, Westermeyer here was referring to you can see, um, various, um, types of severity, um, in, um, disorders, um, even within, um, one culture or from one culture varying to another and varying among ethnic groups. The second example of pathoplasticity, um, of non-psychotic disorders is illustrated by the relative distribution of depression, conversion reaction, anxiety, somatoform disorder and obsession- compulsion which differs from one culture to another, so here again, we're talking about, um, differences, potentially, in rates of, um, certain disorders across, um, different cultures, um, whether one disorder is diagnosed more so in one culture as opposed to another culture, and then the third example of cross-cultural pathoplasticity is the better outcome of schizophrenia in developing countries than in developed countries, um, so this finding, um, from the international, um, studies that were conducted on schizophrenia shows that people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia in developing countries, um, seemed to have better outcomes than people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia in developed countries, so for example, a person diagnosed with schizophrenia in India would have a much better outcome and, um, course and ability to be integrated within, um, the society, um, and their cultural group as opposed to, let's say, a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia in the US, where there's, um, more difficulty with integrating this person within, um, a more collective, collectivistic setting. Now a fourth example, um, of pathoplasticity is that it is possible that certain psychopathological states may be represented by different diagnosis in different countries or cultures, um, so, um, this would be for example, um, as were talking about(inaudible ) earlier, which may be, for example, often diagnosed maybe as an anxiety disorder, um, in, um, the mainstream, I guess, US culture, um, so there is the risk of, um, then also thinking of culture-bound syndromes, um, as something that may be exotic and very different, but actually, um, has very similar under, underlying processes to some of the um, other diagnoses that we have been studying in the DSM 5, or 4, so the threats to cultural validity and diagnosis comes from a failure to recognize, um, the cultural plasticity often associated with various forms of psychopathology, and now different studies have also demonstrated this um, pathoplasticity of psychiatric disorders among Asian Americans, um, so I, um, I know that there's a lot of information on this slide, but I will, um, try to go over it and, um, make sure that you can, um, hear - if you can't read - what's on the slide, so one example regarding the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia among Chinese comes from Berk and Hirata, um, and there was a historical analysis of hospital records of the, um, Chinese in California from 1855 to 1955, and they found that there was an increase in the diagnosis of paranoia at that time, where the rate jumped from 3%, um, previously to 9% at that time among the Chinese patients, and upon further analysis, it was noted that this rise was immediately following the passage, um, of the Chinese Exclusion Act, um, and outbreaks of violence directed against the Chinese, so the rate during the period of exclusion and persecution arose and then gradually diminished to negligible proportions, um, so this is a really good example how, um, a disorder may be pathoplastic and, in this case, really influenced by what may be going on in the current political or sociopolitical, um, context, um, and this, in this case, it seems like the political experiences of the oppressed cultural minorities may also affect their patterns of psychopathology. Now, do cultural factors also influence the diagnosis of, um, Asian Americans? So moving on to the second threat, cultural factor influencing symptom expression, um, there are some studies to suggest that, um, different cultural factors may influence the diagnosis of Asian Americans. As an example of how ethnic origin may influence symptom expression, um, Enright and Jaeckle examined the behavioral patterns of Japanese and Filipino patients with schizophrenia at the Hawaii state hospital and found that Japanese patients expressed more depression, withdrawal and disturbance in thinking. Now, Filipino patients on the other hand exhibited more overt disturbance of behavior and had more delusions of persecution. In another study of how culture may influence the manifestation of symptoms among Asian Americans, um, (ph)captain (ph)colleagues provided an example of inter-group differences, so they studied, um, the descriptions of Japanese and white patients with acute schizophrenia before hospital admission and during their hospital stay, um, and this is typically not a design that you see in most studies. Um, most of the research is typically conducted when people are already in the hospital or potentially when, after they're discharged, um, so in this study, um, one of the interesting findings, um, was that, before hospitalization, the Japanese were described as more socially, um, obstreperous, nervous and hyperactive than the whites, so they seemed to be described as more rowdy by their families, as more disruptive, but once in the hospital, their behavior actually changed, and the whites, um, were rated as more excited and disturbed, um, than the Japanese at that time, so one of the, um, potential explanations for this finding was that the Japanese patients were just as disturbed as, um, the white patients when they were, um, at home, and they were in a setting where they felt comfortable, um, to express those symptoms, but then, later on when they were hospitalized, um, potentially, um, in a setting where they're, they may risk losing face or, um, there are other people and their behavior is in a very different context at that point, um, they were, um, actually rated, um, as, um, I guess, less disturbed at that point, whereas the whites' behaviors did not change. Now, another, um, example of, of um, cultural factors influencing symptom expression, um, are different, um, culture-bound syndromes, and one example of this is, um, Pang's study of Hwabyung, which provided an example of a tendency to somaticize psychological symptoms, um, among Asian Americans, um, and this is seen across a variety of cultures often and is reported as having more emphasis or putting more emphasis on, um, some somatic symptoms while suppressing emotions, um, and, or (ph)manifasting, manufa-, (ph)festing them physically, and then from the more um, recent literature, um, Chinese outpatients were found to report more depressive somatic symptoms in spontaneous reports and structured interviews, while Euro-Canadian outpatients reported significantly more depressive affective symptoms, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness and guilt in all three assessment modalities, and this, um, is potentially again indicating that when there was this face to, um, face to face and open-ended interview, um, contact, maybe this is when, um, the Chinese patients were not necessarily reporting the somatic symptoms, but more, more willing to report them in the self-report and the, um, in the spontaneous report, or the structured, spontaneous report and, and structured interviews, whereas the um, Euro-Canadian outpatients, for all the of the assessment, um, types, were reporting the (ph)psych affective um, symptoms of depression more often than the Chinese health patients. The third, um, threat to cultural validity, um, that we discuss is therapist bias in clinical judgment and therapist bias, um . . . Often, racial and ethnic differences may affect therapist, um, clinical judgment in assessments such that a therapist may over-pathologize a culturally different client, so when, um, a therapist is potentially not being able to connect with the client or understand within their cultural context, um, what their behaviors are and how they make sense, they may tend, whether it's because of their anxiety that they're not aware of what's going on or how to explain the behavior, they may tend to over-pathologize, um, the client's behavior, and problems of diagnosis due to therapist bias has been observed with African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans, so it's a, um, it's been documented for quite a few decades. An example of this in an analog study by, um, Li-Repac, um, there was a, um, finding that the degree of familiarity with the patient's cultural background may influence the diagnostic process, and so Li-Repac had five white and five Chinese-American therapists, um, and they rated the same Chinese and white clients on a videotaped interview on several different dimensions, and the author found that the white therapists were more accurate in predicting self-descriptive responses of white clients than of Chinese clients, and more importantly, she also found that the white therapists rated the Chinese clients higher on depression and inhibition, um, and lower on social poise and interpersonal capacity, and that was in comparison to the Chinese-American therapists. Moreover, the Chinese-American therapists judged the white therapists to be more severely disturbed, um, than did the white therapists, so you saw that, that cross-cultural (ph)diet assessment, um, in some ways seemed to really differ, um, in comparison to the within, um, same-ethnic group assessment, and I think the, the interesting question is probably here where is, where does the truth lie and, um, whose, I guess, assessment or diagnosis would you consider um, to be more accurate. Now, um, the fourth threat to cultural validity is len-, uh, language capability of the client. Uh, another language um, problem in clinical diagnosis is also the use of interpreters and its effects on diagnostic evaluations with, um, Asian Americans, um, and although this may be an extreme example, um, you can imagine that in, for example, um, in um, diet where there is an interpreter in the room and, um, the psychologist asks the client "How are you doing today?", um, and maybe the client answers, um, "I'm doing okay today because I'm wearing my magical pants," um, and so in this case, if the interpreter decided not to translate that part or um, was not necessarily educated or had a psychology background, he or she may not necessarily convey that and this could be then an important piece of information that would potentially get lost, um, in the diagnosis and assessment process, so Yakushko examined the personal and professional factors related to positive and successful clinical care with limited English proficiency individuals and found that the key characteristics of both therapists and interpreters, um, are being flexible, open to learning, and attentive to nuances, so as, um, pointed out, um, by Fred as well, um, there are several ways in which language may serve as a barrier to effective therapeutic communication, um, in Asian Americans who speak little or no English may be misunderstood by their, um, therapists. Their bilingual background could also result in their being perceived often as uncooperative, solemn, um, and negative or unwilling to share personal information, and then as, um, indicated by Shuy, the use often of dialects or non-standard English may interfere with the effective exchange of information, or worse, stimulate bias in the therapist performing the evaluation. Now, um, a few more examples about language, um, so Imada compared the Japanese equivalents of anxiety, um, fu-an and fear, kyo-fu, and um, depression, yu-utsu, for their, um, connotative meanings, and the Japanese expression of fu-an seemed more psychological than physical, and overlapped little with, in connotative meanings of anxiety, and then both anxiety and depression were reported as more physical experiences than fu-an and yu-utsu, so these findings make, make you wonder whether, when we translate words or think that we have the equivalent words in one language and another, whether we are actually, um, also translating the meaning of, um, those words and whether there's things that are really lost in translation, so in a chapter that Fred and I um, have um, just completed, we identified a fifth source of threats to cultural validity in diagnosis and assessment, and the um, threat involves inappropriate use of clinical and personality tests with racial and ethnic minorities, whereas the first four threats that I just talked about are um, more specific to diagnosis. This fifth threat is specific to assessment, so in general, clinical and personality tests, test results of Asian Americans have tended to show that Asian Americans have more severe symptoms (ph)in profiles than whites, um, and this um, has been um, seen with um, some of um, the MMPI-2 scales, um, and then potentially also reporting more somatic um, symptoms, as well as spikes on um, schizophrenia um, scales and subscales. Now, although there is a convergence of data from many studies indicating that Asian Americans have more neurotic and disturbed personality profiles on objective self-report measures, the results of these tests still need to be interpreted with a great deal of caution for several reasons. First, most of these measures were developed and norm'd with white samples, and this was, um, again, an issue raised with the previous two presentations. Um, they were designed to be predictive for whites, or at least these were the participants in the samples that were used for the validation of the measures, for the most part, um, and their predictive validity for other ethnical and cultural group needs to be independently established. Second, as pointed about Sue and Morishima and um, Uba, the majority of cross-cultural personality studies um, used to be conducted with, and in some cases still are conducted with college students um, and at, um, at least in the last um, two or three decades were conducted mainly in Hawaii and using, and um, it was typically the same people who are conducting these studies, um, and third, although promising, only a few of the clinical-diagnostic instruments have been translated into um, Asian languages, so therefore, in using um, these personality and diagnostic tests with Asian Americans, there is a need to recognize that there are important cross-cultural differences in definitions of mental illness and mental health and that there are indeed many ways of being human, and clinicians who use the extensive diagnostic and personality tests to diagnose Asian American patients without being aware of these issues and limitations may well be arriving at culturally invalid diagnoses. Now, I'm going to um, transition to the second part of the presentation now. So the first one was on threats to cultural validity, and the second one, the second part has to do with measurement equivalence, so reliability and validity um, are the major criteria for good measurement in psychology and in cross-cultural research, there is the added requirement of evaluating the cross-cultural reliability and validity of our measures. The concept of measurement equivalence has become, um, the primary scheme for evaluating the cross-cultural validity of our measures, and related to our current discussion, the International Test Commission, um, that um, has published important guidelines for adapting tests for use across cultures, so you can um, go to this link, um, which has specific guidelines for how to translate and adapt tests, um, to different languages, um, and um, increasingly, um, researchers um, and practitioners who may then um, translate an instrument and want to um, then provide it to others have been using these, so measurement um, equivalence, um, I guess um, Berry has provided a critical review of measurement equivalence issues in cross-cultural research and conceptually he argued that meaningful comparison of two phenomena um, predisposes um, the same underlying dimension, so in order to be able to compare two things, we need to know that we are comparing them across a meaningful um, dimension, so therefore, comparison um, requires dimensional identity, which in turn needs to be established for universality and equivalence, and measurement non-equivalence would serve as a threat to cross-cultural validity, in this case. Now, whereas authors um, such as T.P. Johnson have identified over 50 types of measurement equivalence, most cross-cultural researchers subscribe to just four major types of measurement equivalence, cuz you can imagine that if you have 50, that would be pretty difficult, um, to navigate, so the four types, um, are linguistic, conceptual, functional and psychometric, which used to be called metric. Now, a little bit more about each of these types. Linguistic equivalence or translation equivalence is concerned with whether the words carry the same meaning, um, and is associated with the same referent across groups, um, so with um, within, I guess, Japanese language, with ishin-denshin, talking about mutual understanding without words um - can we really translate this in one word or at least a few a words that would capture that same meaning, linguistically? The second type, functional equivalence, may be established by showing that two or more behaviors in different cultures are functionally related to similar problems, so one example with functional equivalence um, is marriage, which may be functionally very different across different cultures, and in one culture, marriage um, may be very much based on um, physical attraction and romantic ideas about um, the relationship between two people, but in other cultures, um, for example, marriage may be used to strengthen family bonds, to um, potentially spread a faith. With um, Islam, for example, having more than one is perfectly, um, or not, is accepted and, in a lot of ways, um, marriage serves different functions from what we would um, think within a Western society. The third type, conceptual equivalence, may be established by demonstrating across cultures the equivalence of a meaning, of a concept or construct representing a set of behaviors, um, and these two examples um, of psychotherapy in particular um, that Fred and I have talked about, how, often, you may see people in other cultures may not have the same idea of psychotherapy that we may have in a Western um, society and how um . . . For example, he talked about the Chi-, um, some Chinese people not necessarily understanding what psychotherapy is, um, or as a concept, not having that as a concept, and then the last type, psychometric equivalence may be shown if psychometric properties of two sets of data are the same for different cultural groups, um, such as fac-, factorial invariance or scalar invariance, so in a little bit more detail about each of these types of equivalents, linguistic equivalence, um, has been mostly known to be established using the back translation method, um, and um, simple translation is not considered and adequate procedure, um, so over the years, back translation has become the standard procedure and technique of choice in cross-cultural research, and the method involves four steps: translating the original instrument from Language A into Language B by someone with expertise in both languages. Then, the next step is translating the translated instrument, which is now in Language B, is then translated into Language A by a separate individual with expertise in both languages again, and then in the third step, the final back-translated version, which is now, again, in Language A, is checked against the original version, which is also in Language A, for accuracy, and the final step: problems of inaccuracy or distorted meaning identified in step three is resolved um, by consultation with translators or an item-by-item basis until a level of um, agreement in um, linguistic equivalence is accomplished in Language B, so through this back translation method, an acceptable version um, in, um, in Language B can then be used um, in cross-cultural research, and now . . . I'm sorry. I think I might've gone back here. Um, all right, so um, so the, these are the, I guess, the four steps of um, linguistic equivalence, and then to give you an example of what that would look like in a study um, that um, validated the Japanese version of the perceived stress scale, um, there were, I guess, Japanese and British couples that were asked to separately translate the scale in Japanese and discuss the conceptual semantic and content equivalence, then a single version based on all translations um, was used and back-translated into English, um, and then native English speakers compared the original to the back translation scale and changed um, any detected distortions. Now, conceptual equivalence, um, is more complex to evaluate and establish than linguistic equivalence, and this may account for the lack of standard procedure, as in the back translation method for linguistic equivalence. However, it would be um, useful in promoting sound cross-cultural research and identifying some best practices in tackling conceptual equivalence, so a crude but common approach to conceptual equivalence has been for researchers to use regression methods to evaluate if regression parameters of the criteria are the same across cultural groups, and although economic and simple, the differences in subject variability and measure reliability may lead to fluctuations in parameters that are difficult to disentangle. Now, to evaluate conceptual equivalence, um, Jean-Claude Usunier has recommended that we use multiple source in target languages and to allow for a de-centering in the translation process, and researchers should start from a rather broad conceptual idea or area, which is almost um, etic, because it corresponds to common problems in all languages and cultures, um, and then the procedure consists in asking native speakers of the languages and cultures concerned to elicit keywords related to the broad conceptual area as in cognitive mapping, and I know that um, Joseph Trimble is uh, later going to show us kind of a network looking at this idea, um, and so um, one, again, example of this, um, is a study, um, where the author, um, Laungani, warned against measurement of stress and discussed stress in Indian culture from an emic perspective, and stress may be perceived in relation to two indigenous concepts, klesha, which um, was defined as life's unavoidable and inevitable vicissitudes, and dukha, the range of sorrowful experiences which individuals go through in the course of their interactions with the world around them. Now, functional um, equivalence, um, is a construct, again, from one culture serves a different and additional function in another culture, um, as with the example of marriage, um, and functional equivalence um, in cross-cultural studies is also related to Cronbach's and Meehl's concept of a normological network of relations supporting construct validity, so a measure is functionally equivalent if both the nature and pattern of relationships between the target measure um, and various constructs in the normological network is similar across cultures, so nudity is strongly associated with embarrassment in Culture A, but not Culture B, and in an, as an example of the lack of um, functional equivalence. The assessment of functional equivalence of measures can occur in three ways in a preventative approach that serves um, as a prerequisite for cross-cultural comparisons, cross-cultural criterion-related and concurrent validity studies and meta-analysis of effect sizes, and as a res-, as a pro-, as a program of research in itself. So I'm going to um, skip over this example for um, time concerns here, um, and going to then talk a little bit more about psychometric equivalence, um, and then have time to wrap up with some implications for research and um, clinical work, so psychometric equivalence, um, is often um, examined using um, structural equation modeling, um, or conducting confirmatory factor analysis to determine the fat, factorial invariance of the instrument, and Barbara Byrne, um, has conducted a series of illustrative studies using indices of factorial invariance in various cross-cultural samples, so a good fit, um, good fit items should be viewed as potentially um, representing etic loading in measures, so more thinking of universally loading, and those that are poor fit may be thought of potentially as emic loading that need further exploration, so poor fit items should be identified for further research into possible issues and conceptual equivalence. Now, according to um, Hui and Triandis, the Item Response Theory method represents a more recent approach to measurement equivalence in cross-cultural research and item and scholar equivalence can be assessed by examining either ch-, item characteristic curves in different cultures, and so two methods may be used, for example, use bilinguals to respond to both versions, um, of the same scale in different languages, and then use the same scale on two different populations, and then Barbara Byrne has also conducted um, and then Barbara Byrne has also conducted a, a few validations of the BDI with uh, the Chinese version of the, or, the BDI, um, so moving forward to our last type of equivalence that um, we have talked briefly about this with norms and the question that was raised earlier with Nicole's talk, um, was that cross-cultural psychologists such as Berry also have tended not to discuss normative equivalence under the measurement equivalence framework, and this is most likely due to the fact that normative equivalence is more closely linked to clinical utility, um, not as a central psychometric issue and professional practice. On the other hand, normative equivalence is probably the form of equivalence that will be most familiar and understandable to professional psychologists. Now, what are the research and practice implications of all of this? So the concept of cultural validity and threats to cultural validity in clinical diagnosis and assessment needs to be incorporated into our training programs to counter the client uniformity myth and color-blind assumptions, and typically programs would do this in different ways; some would spread material throughout different courses and others would have specific courses, such as multicultural psychology, um, to do um, this, um, and cross-cultural competence um, in diagnosis with Asian Americans requires clinicians to learn about the culture-specific aspects of Asian American communication styles - um, their respect for authority and hierarchy, favoring of indirect and non-verbal communication forms. Clinicians also need to become familiar with the challenges associated with measurement equivalence when testing culturally different clients and patients, and when reviewing and interpreting the results of clinical assessments, it would be important to evaluate potential problems associated with the lack of conceptual, functional and linguistic equivalence in our assessment instruments. We need more psychometric equivalence studies um, to show um, that the instruments that we are using um, are in fact um, psychometrically valid - oops - um, and whereas there has been significant advances in tackling um, linguistic and psychometric equivalence problems, there is also greater need um, to examine more closely conceptual and equivalent, functional equivalence in clinical diagnosis and assessment, and um, as you um, are probably thinking, all of these types of equivalents are interconnected, so quite often, researchers focus so much on psychometric equivalence without realizing the contributing role of conceptual and functional equivalence to the former, and NIH um, has funded cultural adaptation studies regarding treatment but not the cultural adaptations of the clinical tools that guide these interventions, and regarding um, normative equivalence, since the norms of the majority of um, personality and diagnostic tests were established with pre-dominantly white samples, it would be important to remember that certain clinical elevations or low scores may be associated with cultural differences rather than psychopathology. Thus, instruments without established measurement equivalence for other cultural groups need to be interpreted with caution, and lastly, we need to tackle the widespread use of culturally inappropriate norms in our field and generate guidelines for handling challenges associated with the lack of normative equivalence. We need more studies to establish culturally appropriate norms and um, cut-off scores for clinical instruments and recommendations on how to generate and use local norms. So thank you all for your attention, and if you have any questions, let me know.
