EXPERIENCES OF COUNSELLING 

00:00:00
Six clients discuss their counselling relationships 

00:00:00
Part 1: Finding a Counsellor and the first session 

00:00:00
Maureen Moore Counsellor and Psychotherapist 

00:00:20
MAUREEN MOORE Hello, and welcome to this discussion. We are going to be looking at people's experiences of counseling. All the members of the group have experienced counseling at some stage in their lives. Clients, like counselors, are very different, and therefore it is very important for someone looking for a counselor with whom they're going to share intimate secrets to find the right person that will suit them and will meet their expectations. I wonder, Mary, would you just share with us something of the way in which you chose your counselor and what that was like? 

00:01:10
MARY Once I decided to, um, go for counseling, um, a friend of mine advised me to actually, um, interview a series of counselors to actually find the, the one that I felt I could work with, and so, um, she actually told me about one counselor that she had worked with and so I rang her up and made an appointment , and then I found, um, two other counselors, one through a journal and one through another friend, and I made an appointment and I had three separate sessions. Um, there were two women and a man and I was dealing with a bereavement, so I really felt like - they were all lovely people - but I felt like the man was a little bit more challenging for me to actually work with a man, so I actually chose the man, and um, I'm really pleased I did because it, um, was a challenging but really helpful, um, to find the right counselor who was really, really helpful, because I wouldn't have carried on with counseling unless I found somebody that I really felt, intuitively, that I could, um, feel safe to work with and feel that they could really listen to me and help me deal with the issues.and (crosstalk)I was (ph)experimenting . . . 

00:02:35
DANIEL (crosstalk)I di-, I did the same thing with that. I went for a . . . I, I thought a man would be best because I felt like my uh, kind of conflicts were to do with uh, you know, uh, fathers and men and how I relate to other men and if it's a man or a woman it's gonna be a different dynamic, and by working things out with a man you can work out, you know, how you relate to each other and, and uh, what it's like to, to go through that experience with that person and um, I think, I think it was, it was better for me at that point in my life. 

00:03:00
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah, that's very interesting. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN Yes, I um, I interviewed two counselors as well and I, I interviewed a man and a woman and went along for a session each, and uh, but I felt that, at that point in time, I needed to speak to a woman, um, so, but the other chap was really sweet and kind and he didn't mind at all. He was really open about it and didn't mind that I needed to go and, um, have a woman as my counselor, so it was, yeah, he was great. 

00:03:30
MAUREEN MOORE Right. Were there any other issues that came up for people choosing the counselors? 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Yes, I think, for me, um, it would have to be somebody I felt connected to and somebody I felt would understand me, so um, I, I went to somebody who, um, I . . . The first counselor I found I didn't really connect with, um, and I didn't feel that she quite understood me as a person, um, so I looked for another one, and the second one I felt very comfortable with, so that was really, for me, how I, um, chose my counselor. 

00:04:15
WALT I noticed that everybody seems to have chosen a counselor and they had something in their mind. With me, when I came to choose my counselor, I was, I just had problems, and I thought, "Well, I'd like to speak to somebody and I really didn't care who they were", and I spoke to a colleague who happened to be a counselor with the hope that he would get me a counselor to help me out, and uh, he was the one who talked to me and we did click, but I didn't have in mind a particular person. I just wanted someone to listen to what I had to say. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, that was the same as me when I went in to see my first counselor. I also had a completely open mind and went in and spoke and I noticed that she wasn't the right counselor for me cuz there was loads of silent moments, so-to-speak, and, and I just couldn't get my head around these periods of silence, um, and, but I did find another counselor who sort of talked more with me about issues. 

00:05:15
MAUREEN MOORE Wow. So, between you, you have chosen counselors to meet your requirements - issues to do with men, needing, thinking that you would like to, to work with a man, something about connectedness and you being a person . . . For you, it was just someone who met your needs who could respond and help you with your problems, um, and you were aware that you, you wanted a more active, fine kind of interaction. So, having chosen this person, what was the first session like? That can be quite, quite challenging. Walt? 

00:06:00
WALT For me, the session almost started from my speaking to him, because he was saying, "Well, tell me a little bit about what your problem is and I'll think about a counselor for you," and I did begin to talk to him, but I guess about five minutes into it you begin to think to yourself, "Hey, I'm exposing all myself to this individual." Now, this individual didn't know me personally, but we did work in the same organization, so it was the feeling, "Do I keep talking? Do I shut up?" But he did make me feel very comfortable and I did feel that he was genuine and he was listening to me and what I had to say to him mattered, and that's what was important to me at that time. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN I can, I can relate to that. I think I was, um, once I started talking, once I'd made up my mind that I was going to talk, I suddenly then felt, "Hey, can this person really understand what I'm talking about and can they cope with what I have to tell them?", um, but I was made to feel very comfortable and contained, um, and, therefore, I carried on talking about the issues. 

00:07:05
DANIEL I felt like I was on the spot, really, a bit. I didn't really know what to do, and he kind of didn't really provide any guidelines. He just kind of . . . Everything I did was kind of almost analyzed and questioned and was providing new, new material, like, "Why did I choose to sit rather than lie down?" and, and, "If I wasn't saying anything then why was I nervous about that?" or "Should I be nervous?" or . . . If I was asking him and why he, he wasn't saying anything kind of . . . So immediately, this started this whole kind of, uh, relationship of analyzing what it's like for us to be in the room together, I suppose, but it was, it was quite awkward, but then, he said, you know, "Why did you choose to sit down?" and I went, uh, you know, "Maybe I should lie down and embrace this fully rather than being very (ph)British and stand- offish and awkward. Let's get down to business." 

00:07:55
MAUREEN MOORE That's interesting. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, my, my counselor, um, in the first session . . . Um, yeah, it really was like as soon as you kind of went in I didn't know where I was gonna start with, anything that I said . . . So um, but she was very good. She sort of led it, to begin with, so she sort of helped me start talking and um, she would sort of guide me. A bit of challenges here and there about things I said. Some things I didn't even aware of the language that I used would be sort of shown back at me (ph)as (ph)if (ph)to (ph)say and, and, "What, why did you say it like that?" and I'd think, "Oh! Golly!" So, you know, some surprises along the way, but it just helped to get things going, so the second session was a lot easier and, um, went on from there, really. 

00:08:45
MARY I found the first session I just had so much to say I just kind of started, you know, just, "Well, I'll bring you up to date with my story," you know? And, you know, and I was, like, really pro-active and, you know, engaging, you know, to the point where I could just see, you know, the nodding going on and then a few questions, you know, and then I just thought, "Okay, I'm not here to entertain this person," you know? "I'm not here to . . . Um, I'm here to actually, you know, be able to talk through what I have to say, but I want to bring you up to date," you know? And that was the interesting part, is that, um, you know, he, he listened to me, but also, he was more than listening. He was actually, um, watching my body language and, you know, kind of giving some response back that actually kind of made pause and actually reflect, um, how, you know, how we are more than what we said, and uh, how we are, you know, that our whole package is part of how we interface in the world, and that was, you know, in a kind of a subtle way, and one other thing that I really found interesting too was actually when I left the session, um, to the ne-, to the next session, I felt like in my dreams and I was, like, replaying the session for . . . You know, it was like, it was an intense little cameo and I was replaying it and replaying it and I, I just felt like I had probably done more out of the chair than in the chair, so-to-speak, which was kind of weird, for a new experience, you know? But it did, um . . . Yeah. I don't know. 

00:10:40
DANIEL It does take uh, it does take that week for it to kind of settle, cuz (ph)you've kind of shaken everything up and looking at it all and then, and then it kind of cements itself each, each week, and you can start making something out of it. But yeah, (inaudible ) afterwards, I suppose, immediately, you know, a day or two after it's . . . And you start to, you start to feel . . . (inaudible) notice a change. 

00:11:00
MAUREEN MOORE So it's a, a kind of process that, part of which happens during the session, but a large part of it happens in between sessions? 

00:11:10
DANIEL Yeah. It happens even, even when you're not thinking about it. You're still, in the back of your mind, you're working, you're working out what was raised and, and because uh, the things you could lay out in, in a session are things you never usually consider thinking about or talking openly about or literally laying out somebody else. I mean, when you do that, it's, it's quite a, quite like a kind of, uh, . . . It's, it's difficult and it shakes you up. You, you leave feeling a bit like, "Whoa," and then uh, but then over, over the next few days, um, you, you become familiar with those feelings you've ro-, ra-, rose up and you, you kind of, then you're so much more accepting of and you feel much more honest with yourself because you're much more confident to kind of, to go back and carry on. 

00:11:50
MAUREEN MOORE One thing that's interesting that's occurred, cropped up with all that has been said is that, in one way or another, all the different counselors have raised your awareness of yourself, either by reflecting the words, in your case, um, you, you know, you said that you became aware that you wanted to talk about and talk more and you, you said you were, you were conscious of what was happening, and you were even conscious of whether you wanted to lied down or, or sit, you know, (crosstalk)and that's physical awareness. 

00:12:25
DANIEL (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:12:25
MAUREEN MOORE That seemed a very kind of basic place to start. 

00:12:30
DANIEL Yeah. 

00:12:30
MAUREEN MOORE And you talked about self-awareness as well. Did you find that with your first session? 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN Um, well, I was just really nervous because I didn't know how much I wanted to let someone else know about my own life, um, so I think I held back a lot, which is why my first counselor didn't work for me, because she didn't push me to get any information out of me, um, but when I went for my first meeting with my second counselor, um, through her talking more and sort of asking me more questions, I opened up a lot more, um, and forgot most of what she said when I walked out, but over the next couple of days, I started going back to what had been said during our meeting. 

00:13:15
WALT I think I was looking for something different with the first session. I thought to myself, "Well, is this gonna be what they say, a counselor? You know, somebody who comes and spews out a lot of jargon to me and, and tells me what Freud said and what my dreams mean, but it didn't happen like that, and I actually noticed, during that time, that the person was listening to what I had to say, he was agreeing, and he was doing things that I didn't thin a counselor would do, this particular individual would do. He smiled; he, you know, made a joke with something - "Oh, is that really going on for you? Geez, that's not too good is it? We don't want that." - and it, it felt good for me, cuz it, me, you know, met my personality, but he also gave me things to think about, you know? He would say, "But let me, let me get this clear and let me get that clear," and when he clarified things it made me stop and think, "Is that how I'm coming across? Is that what you're seeing? Maybe I need to think about this." So . . . But I think if it had been someone else and not that particular individual, then I don't know, because my ideal would be the stereotype: lay on the sofa and listen to somebody while they took notes and they spouted theorems to you or theories or whatever, but the thing is that it didn't happen like that. He was a human being as far as I was concerned. Therefore, I could relate to him, and that's what, I think, I would've definitely needed. If I didn't have that the first go, I think I would've walked away. 

00:14:50

00:14:50
Part 2: Developing the Counselling Relationship 

00:14:55
MAUREEN MOORE And this leads nicely into the, um, next question or the next thing that I'd like to put to you all again. What was it like, then, talking to a counselor over a period of time? Okay, so you've had your first session, but then, this has got to go on possibly for a few weeks, but uh, (crosstalk)the time varies. 

00:15:15
WALT (crosstalk)Well, for me, I, I think it was, it became, not nerve- wracking; I think challenging would be the word. It became very, very challenging, to the points, on some weeks, I thought to myself, "Can I stand this person showing me more about myself?" But I think it was because my counselor said, "Well, we're gonna discuss what's happening with you, but I'm here to help you move on," and I think if it was that him being there, that gave me the courage, I guess, to actually come back the next session and the sessions after that, but, for me, it was extremely challenging, because I thought myself to be an entirely different type of person, and when you start showing me something else, then that's puts a whole lot of my life - well, it did - into a different perspective, so, yes, it, it was. The more it went on, the more challenging it became, but the more you were beginning to learn, the more you were beginning to see. 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Well, well, my, my counselor, um, sort of told me in the beginning the sort of process that we'd go through, so I was really clear and um, and we even did sort of mind maps and little family maps and, you know, sort of, or my own personal life map of where I thought I was to start with, and, and then um, sort of, by the end of it, we'd do it again to see how everything fitted together by the end and how I felt things had changed, so it really was a nice, um, almo-, not a circle, but it was a nice little rounding off towards the end. 

00:17:00
MAUREEN MOORE So there was a beginning and (crosstalk)an end? 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)It was a process and there was an end, yeah, so I felt like I had gone there, you know, spilled all the beans about everything and, and gone through a process, you know, painful at times, tearful at times, but funny as well, and, um, (ph)think (ph)I (ph)didn't (ph)safe, you know, um, and, you know, she almost seems like a friend, really, by the end of it, because she shared a lot with me, um, and helped me through it, so yes. 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN I think that's why I liked going to see my counselor, because, um, once a week, I could go and sort of let off, sort of, everything that had happened during the week or anything that I wasn't sure about. I could sort of let it go and, and work through it with someone outside of the house, um, which was really good, um, and also, she didn't, she wouldn't give me answers to anything. I'd work them out for myself, which was also really good because it's then not like you're going somewhere to be told, "Do this or do that." You sort of come to whatever you want to do yourself. 

00:18:10
DANIEL Yeah, I'm, I remember that. Um, it was like a kind of - don't know what the word is - but my first, I remember the first time I went there it was raining and it was gray and it was dark and it was winter and I was like, "God, what am I doing walking in here, looking for help?" but uh, I, I mean I, I went for it anyway and um . . . But then, I, maybe six months later, on the last I ever went, it was a bit upsetting, like, cuz you do, you do quite, you develop a relationship with that person and, you know, they don't know each other, but you still . . . They know everything about you and they've genuinely helped you until you feel a connection, but I, I didn't have a problem going but then, but when I went outside and then it was like a completely clear sky and all the clouds were gone. It was like a kind of, like, "God, I feel like I'm in a film," you know? It was absolutely perfect. But that does, does . . . It did feel like that, but um, over the course of the more you go back you start to kind of, I don't know. Towards the end, you kind of . . . I felt like there was . . . Um, you know, there's almost like a limit, and I didn't think I could go as far as I could and I thought almost like I wasn't comfortable going that, that kind of far into, into how I work and my own weaknesses, you know, but then, I think, eventually, you kind of, you kind of want to truly know your own weaknesses cuz it, it . . . Even though it's difficult to break, break, get through that barrier, then, you, you just feel stronger for it. You really do, cuz you're being honest with yourself. 

00:19:30
MAUREEN MOORE You, you, you speak about the, the relationship that developed and the (crosstalk)fact that it was difficult for you to, to end the relationship that you had. 

00:19:40
DANIEL (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN Well . . . Although, at the same time, it's very, it's empowering, isn't it? And . . . 

00:19:40
DANIEL It's (crosstalk)important. 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN . . . (crosstalk)your counselor is there, um, kind of helping you, um, you know, and, and you feel more empowered, so, um, they're not doing everything for you. They're just helping you to do it yourself so then you feel strong enough and more confident and you feel much better to go out in the world and, and continue your life, you know? So . . . 

00:20:00
DANIEL And if you can talk to them about how you feel about, you know, not seeing them again, then you, straight away, it's like if you, you feel (ph)something to talk about cuz that says something about who you are, depending on how, you know, how it affects you to leave that person you're close to, especially if it's a man, for instance, to re-live, say, if you, uh, you, you lost a dad or your parents got split up or something, you, immediately, you're touching on it and they can, they can, you can say that, the last one, and they can go, "Well, look, you should uh, look at it like this," or, "What does that say? What have you . . . How does it feel compared to how would it felt six months ago?" 

00:20:35
MARY I found that leaving was difficult, and I had a long-term counselor who had me over five years, and um, it was uh, a special . . . I mean, it was within the boundary, you know, but that person, I felt like, knew me more than anybody on this whole planet because, you know, it was a relationship that was absolutely dedicated to me, for me and I remember, you know, sometimes . . . You know, you go through different journeys as you do on any relationship. Sometimes you just think you're, you get a little bored and you think, "Oh my god," you know, and it's like, "Is it still working for me? I'm paying for it," and um, but then, you know, you get to the point where you think, "Well, actually, it's time to move on," and that actually takes a lot of courage to be able to do that, you know, and to be able to say, and I know I found it really emotional to actually have to say bye-bye, you know? But I, you know, I, what I really appreciated was that, um, this person actually did said, you know, "The door is ajar and you can come back at any time should you want to, should you need to." It wasn't like this relationship is in, in a (ph)boltalor, is severed now, but actually, this relationship is, is part of, you know, your journey and that it's um, it's valued, and just to really feel that the relationship isn't that you're just on a conveyor belt, going in there, seeing somebody and there's somebody waiting in the queue, you know, and that - you know what I mean? - which is kind of difficult, you know? Uh, but it's that actually, um, you've developed a relationship and actually that's sharing and that the counselor is a human being who is trying to actually listen but actually has feeling as well, and (crosstalk)um . . . 

00:22:25
DANIEL (crosstalk)Who cares about you (crosstalk)as much as you care about them. 

00:22:30
MARY (crosstalk)(crosstalk)And who really cares about you, yeah, and that is like, wow, that's actually something special in the world, and that is a real gift, to actually have that, you know? 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN I guess I'm thinking about my own journey towards the end, and uh, what I really learned from my counselor was that, um, uh, she helped me to become aware that I was really important and I could manage. I did . . . You know, she was there to prop me up, but, at the end, I was strong enough to go on my own journey and I could, I could actually say good-bye, um, with pleasure and pain, um, but that's, you know, that was really empowering for me. 

00:23:15
MAUREEN MOORE It's interesting, the, the, the issue of, or the um, mention of paying someone to listen has uh, come up in, in the group, and um, I've often the thought that there is quite a difference or there could seem to be quite a difference between paying someone to listen and having someone in your own family, perhaps a grandparent or an uncle or aunt or even a parent who listens for free, and the perception that the relationship or the type of care will be different, and the reality is, once you experience counseling, the care and the understanding that you receive from the counselor is, is so intense that the, the, the issue of money and payment doesn't come into it. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Yes. I, I think it, it, it becomes almost as essential as eating or, you know, because that's the nourishment. It's the emotional nourishment that was lacking in my life, and money didn't matter, it didn't count, because that's what I needed to carry on, and find myself. 

00:24:30
DANIEL And it's wo-, worth paying for. It's worth paying for because it's just a different type of listening. I mean, there's listening with uh, when you, when you know somebody already and, you know, you have all this context for them and uh, it's personal and you have your opinions about each other and you have a kind of, kind of, kind of, a kind of very personal relationship compared to somebody who's got professional training and is objective and uh, is thinking about everything you're saying, and, and uh, helping you direct yourself and, and, really, basically completely selfless - they're listening to you - whereas you won't get it anywhere else. So you're paying for that selflessness really, and that super objectivity, which is . . . I mean, I mean, you're gonna have to pay for that, really, aren't you? (inaudible ) unless they agree to do it for free. 

00:25:15
MARY And it's an investment too. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN It is. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:15
MARY It's an investment in your own self and your well-being, and also, you know, like dealing with the issues that you've found, you, you know, there's a reason for going, and you, you go with um, and it's . . . If you can do it - you know, it's not for everybody - but for people I've gone to, it's really an investment and it did empower me to find my voice through a very difficult time. 

00:25:45
DANIEL They do offer free counseling, don't they, in a lot of places, which is why it's such a good thing to take advantage of cuz it's, you know, like free medicine or something. 

00:25:55
WALT I never thought about whether it was, you know, you had to pay. I did think about, you know, going to a friend and speaking to a friend or speaking to a relative, but it, it wasn't the same. I, I think speaking to them, they knew me and maybe I was giving away something that I didn't personally wish to give away within my family, but when you're speaking to a stranger - well, a stranger at the beginning - it was different; they listened, and I didn't, I never had the feeling that they were paying to listen to me, and then as time went on, so many changes occurred within myself that money really didn't matter. It, it definitely never came up, as far as I was concerned. I could see the changes and I could see the benefits, as far as I was concerned, so no, money was not . . . I don't think that uh, a relative would've given me that. I would've always had, in the back of my mind somewhere, "You're listening to me because you have to listen to me," you know? "You're my mom" or "You're my aunt," or whatever, but this man is gonna tell me what I need to know and I need to hear, and he's gonna help me to understand what I need to hear. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN I think . . . Well, my, my counselor was almost like a, um, almost like holding up a mirror for me, so like, so, you know, reflecting back so much and it is. It's, it's, you know, it's your own personal journey and so you, you got to counselor to kind of find out about yourself and um, I couldn't go to my parents to find out about myself because my parents think I'm somebody different to who I am, so, you know . . . 

00:27:35
DANIEL So they become, they become an extension of yourself, really . . . 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:35
MARY (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:27:35
DANIEL (crosstalk)Counselors . . . It's like uh, it's like having a whole other area of your brain, which is completely untouched by, um, I don't know, yourself, really, or, or your own insecurities, and uh, unlike a, like a family member or something who um, I don't know, knows, knows that, you know, knows, knows you in all the, in your, kind of, angles and, and (ph)need (ph)you really, and, you know, they love, and if they love, especially if they love you as well, and it, and that's, and that gets in the way of things, you know, cuz it, they'll be upset for you, or . . . And you can't afford that, you can't afford that, too much of that, really, if you're truly really listening to you cuz it, it becomes biased and stuff and (crosstalk)you start offering the wrong advice and (crosstalk)it's not really about that. 

00:28:15
WALT (crosstalk)Exactly. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)They've got too much invested in (crosstalk)you, haven't they, (crosstalk)because they love you so much. 

00:28:20
WALT (crosstalk)Yes. (crosstalk)Exactly. 

00:28:20
Part 3: A Time and Space Just For Me 

00:28:25
[music] 

00:28:30
MAUREEN MOORE Some really important points have come up about the way in which you might or might not involve families as, as um, the lis-, as your listeners, and I wonder what's the difference between going and talking to a member of your family and um, perhaps talking to a counselor? What's the difference? Why one and not the other? 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN I guess, um, when you're talking to a member of the family, the ba-, you know, how confident, um, the information is going to be kept is very difficult to understand. Um, some, you know, with, with our family, um, we have an understanding that information needs to be shared, regardless of who it belongs to, so um, before you go out the door, it may, you know, the rest of the family would know about it, um, whereas with the, with a counselor, um, I can be really assured that whatever I say will remain in the room and within the walls. 

00:29:40
MAUREEN MOORE All right, so confidentiality within the family is not the sort of confidentiality that you want? It, it sounds strange, (crosstalk)cuz it's confidential within the family, but . . . 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)It's, it's . . . Yeah, it's confidential within the family, but there are somethings which are con-, confidential to the person or the relationship. Uh, often, the issue is about a relationship with someone else, um, or maybe a relationship with my self, so um, it's, maybe, something that I don't want to share with other people in the family. 

00:30:20
MAUREEN MOORE You're nodding? 

00:30:20
WALT Yes, uh, I, I think that struck it for me. There were certain things that I thought my family thought I was a particular type of person, and perhaps I shouldn't have some of the problems that I did have, and, because of that, I, I also thought that if you tell your family everything about you that they could be upset if they couldn't fix it, if they couldn't make it better. Again, with, with my counselor, I didn't have that. I knew that I could speak to them, I could expose my whole life and we could look at it in a reasonable way and there would be somebody there to help me, not give me advice, cuz I think I would go to my family if I wanted advice, cuz they definitely want you to be better or they might not accept who you really are or what you really are, and I know for a fact that if I'd have spoken to one member of my family, they'd have said, "No, you really don't think that way. You need to go away and think about it. You, you're, you're not thinking right," so it, it wouldn't have been even a chance to examine what was in there or anything else. No, I, I didn't have any qualms about speaking to a stranger, (ph)as (ph)you say, but I would've thought quite long and hard, uh, speaking to a relative, and I was very, very close to my family, but uh, I would've thought very long and hard about that. 

00:31:45
DANIEL Because uh, talking to a therapist is not like it's . . . It is about, uh, it's, it's the same as, it's almost like a kind of extension of your own head, really, cuz it's all, you're talking to somebody who's uh, uh . . . I suppose talking to a . . . I'd say talking to a counselor is not like talking to somebody outside of yourself. It's more like just creating more space inside of yourself where you can sort of share their brain space, in a way, to kind of analyze yourself, and so nothing ever really leaves you, whereas, um, as soon as you tell somebody who isn't a counselor who isn't professional who isn't trained to have that objectivity and who isn't a stranger and you're, you're, you're um, you're exposing yourself and you're, uh, you're immediately putting, putting limits on what you can explore and what you can say, because uh, it's, it's, it's in your, it's in the outside world, rather than an internal world which is the world which you and the counselor share and that's what, that's what makes it special because they're not, they're not external like they seem they are. They become this extension of yourself and uh, give you that room to look at it, and you do need . . . It takes two brains to, to fix one, really. That's what I think. Well, not fix, but improve, you know, or (crosstalk)look at and analyze. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:32:55
MAUREEN MOORE Extend. 

00:32:55
DANIEL Yeah. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think it is about exploring you and just having that space to, um, kind of try things out in, in a way, and uh, really explore yourself in a way that, you know, I wouldn't really want to bother or worry a member of my family or, or a best friend, you know, my best friends about having a good laugh with, you know, and things like that, and yeah, hard times as well, but, um, when you're getting to, like, really nitty-gritty things that you want to share with a counselor then it's, yeah, definitely the best place, and you have the confidentiality thing . . . You know, it, it helps you feel safe. I think it helps you feel safer. 

00:33:35
DANIEL And even if they did, even if they were, even if some, uh, if your counselor did happen to go crazy and tell somebody something, you still, you still don't know them; you don't know their family, you don't know their friends, you're not connected to them, so, you know, even, even if it wasn't confidential it would still work because it's un-, it's disconnected from you. There's a huge (ph)kick (ph)and gap there. 

00:33:55
WALT You also see your family all the time, don't you, so you're exposing yourself continuously. Once you make that statement, whatever statement it is, to them, it's there . . . 

00:34:05
DANIEL Yeah. 

00:34:05
WALT . . . so as long as you're there . . . It's not the same as speaking to your counselor, talking it over, listening to what is, is said and him listening to you, going away, and thinking about it in, in your own time. You're not there looking and thinking, "Oh gosh, what have I done now? What have I told them? I should've kept my mouth shut," because they're gonna see you all the time. 

00:34:25
DANIEL Yeah. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN I guess . . . And also, um, not everybody is a good listener and knows how to contain what's being heard. Um, you know, I know with my partner is a, a gr-, uh, a really good fixer at everything else, but talking to him about emotions is . . . Usually, he has a solution and I don't often want a solution. I want to be heard, um, so I can find my own solution, so I think, I think that, often, doesn't work with the family. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think it also helps talking to someone who doesn't know people that you know, um, whereas if you're talking to an aunty or an uncle, they know people you might be talking about. If I've had an argument with someone and wanted to get that off my chest, if I go and talk to a counselor who doesn't know the other person, it sort of makes it easier to talk through things with as well. 

00:35:20
MARY I find that uh, on another side of that, that, actually, um, our relationship with people are like friends or family, and I found the relationship with the counselor really challenging because he couldn't be my friend, um, and, you know, when the time was up, the time was up, out the room kind of thing, so you had to actually within this container and this time frame, which was the professional way to work and, but it was a different type of relationship, and I personally found that an adjustment, but actually it was the safety of having that, and that's how it works, it's actually it is within a container, but there was a part of me that actually got angry with that, that uh, you know, your an-, you know, your answer, you know, you're giving me the space and, you know, um . . . Where is the two-way in the relationship? You know? Because that is our conditioning and that is our expectation in a relationship, so it was learning to be in a, in a different type of relationship, and um, so yeah, I did learn how to do that, but it was, you know, it was quite a challenge to re-align (crosstalk)and to be able to do that. 

00:36:40
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk)So it's, it sounds like (ph)walking . . . Some . . . One of the things that makes the relation different, one of the things, is the sort of boundaries that you have in the counseling relationship . . . 

00:36:55
MARY Yes 

00:36:55
MAUREEN MOORE . . . are very different from the boundaries that you have with a friendship . . . 

00:36:55
MARY Yes. 

00:36:55
MAUREEN MOORE . . . and again, different to the kind of boundaries that, that are within most families, and all of those boundaries are known to you, and certainly in counseling, the boundaries are made clear, as you say, "when the time is up, you're out" . . . 

00:37:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:37:15
MAUREEN MOORE . . . and that is it, so in each area, you have a specific little kind of list of things that you can and can't do and are available to you, so (ph)those (ph)perhaps one of the things that makes the counseling, although it's strict and fairly precise, makes that relationship different. 

00:37:35
MARY Yes, because it's like a different type of laboratory, almost, you know? It's a different setting, it's a different film set, it's got a different set of rules than we have in our family relationships and our friendship relationships, and it's being able to accommodate and learn how to be in that relationship because it's different, and it's dealing with our conditioning, and uh, but we learn, but I learned a lot of valuable stuff about my expectations and my, my way of interfacing in the world by actually going in to the that kind of laboratory . . . 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:10
MARY . . . which is, you know, and it is scientific, how it works. I mean, it works with, uh, you know, the heart relationship as well, but it's, you know . . . And that scientific or that, that way of working actually is, is part of, was one of the valuable things to actually get a result. Otherwise, it's, you know . . . 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN I think I, I found that modeling quite useful, cuz I think having those really set boundaries helped me to become more organized, um, and I was learning cuz my counselor was modeling these behaviors or attitudes. Um, it helped me to focus on my own organization, which, which really helped me to, um, sort myself out. 

00:39:05
MAUREEN MOORE So are you saying that this kind of boundaries and rules that are held within the counseling relationship, somehow influence the way the you manage the boundaries and relationships outside of the counseling relationship? 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Yes, uh, initially, it was with myself, um, and, and, you know, just to give you an example, I would be organized so that I had some idea of what I needed to work with when I went back again, whereas, when I first started counseling, I would just go in and be, "Okay, I'll let the counselor tell me what I need to know," but um, as time went through, I started becoming organized in, "Oh, well, look, perhaps . . ." if something happened, "Oh, I'll type that into my counseling session and see what, where I can take it," so once I applied it to myself then I could apply it to other areas in, in my life too. 

00:40:00
MARY I found it a discipline . . . 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:40:05
MARY . . . as well, um, you know, going and actually setting the time to set aside and you could just go and sit or you could go and bring something or you could pick up a thread from the last session, which you kind of weave in and kind of, kind of look at a little bit closer with another eye because you could kind of cooking it in your mind between sessions, you know, and um, through doing that, it was actually a valuable skill of reflection, and, and also, it's okay to question, it's okay just uh, to be in that space of, of angst or in that space of not knowing. It was okay not to know; it was okay just to be, and that was something very valuable that I learned, you know, just, you know, just to be at the skill that, that, you know, the discipline of going into that place and actually setting yourself aside that time to discover, to actually . . . 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, and I think some, one of the change I found was that I started liking parts of myself that I perhaps didn't quite like or like prior to counseling. 

00:41:30
WALT Yeah, so I think . . . You know, you talked about the relationship and I was thinking about that. Now, I think, it's not like any other relationship I can think of. There is no one - well, not in my family, in any case - that was willing to give me that undivided time and no one who was willing to say, "Hey, what do you think about this, what's going on?" I think if you take that relationship and try and put it any place else except where we put it, in a counseling session, with those boundaries and everything . . . You need those things, and when you have those things, you can expose yourself, you can explore, you can look, and, I think, within that relationship that can be done, but if it isn't within that relationship as a friend - well, I don't know any friend who could give me that sort of time, uh, and listen, uh, and ask me to explore what I've just said or done, but if it's done and it's done well as I've seen it done, then you can't beat it, you can't. 

00:42:35
DANIEL Ideally, you could, you could explore your, your, yourself to that extent on your own, but um, you just get lost and um, you just get lost and you get, um, you start to you get confused and you can't be certain about nothing and you can't make decisions about . . . I mean, cuz it's possible to explore your own, your own mind, but you can't . . . You just . . . Having other, having that space or environment allows you to, to constantly to (inaudible ) like climbing a mountain, I suppose. It allows you to put those safety pins on and then, then move up and put another one in. Otherwise, you just, you just, you don't, you don't, you don't even get anywhere cuz you keep, keep falling out. 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN But, but I think after the, after the counseling sessions that I had, I was also able to sort of continue that awareness that I gained within the counseling sessions, so, I could, you know, I still had that kind of special, sacred me-time space to sort of continue, um, really, on my own, because it gave me so much strength for afterwards. 

00:43:40
Part 4: Reflections on the Counselling Process 

00:43:45
[music] 

00:43:50
MAUREEN MOORE I'm really interested in this idea of, of continuing. Um, you were speaking about continuing, having completed counseling, but I'm thinking also of continuing the session in some way, process the session, and um, and what you have talked about during the session, during the periods between meeting with your counselor. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Well, yeah, I think, inevitably, throughout the week, you do notice situations or things you talked about that, that, you know, may set off triggers, you know, so you, so your, you awareness becomes more heightened in your everyday life, and so, you know, particular relationships, whether it's about partner or, or a member of the family, you know, whatever you've talked about, um, or work, for example. You know, we've all gotta carry on working and the counseling session is almost like pausing your life for a minute to kind of outpour, you know, have an outpouring, trying to sort of go through a few messy bits, and then, you know, go back into real life. You know? Well, you've, you've still got this stuff going on, but you can start applying the things that you're learning about. 

00:45:05
DANIEL And the skills, though, cuz it, you, you develop enough, like, skills and techniques that uh, for, I don't know, and which you can, you can use, you know, about uh, sticking up for yourself and uh, or um, sticking up for other people, or uh, having a, you know, sticking to your, your, what you truly believe and uh, (inaudible ) . . . Every counselor has a different way of, you know, making you, helping you think about these things. You leave, and if you see the situation's coming about - usually, through other people; it's usually other people; it's usually to do with people around you, you know, trying, doing something to you or getting something from you, but uh, if you can see, you start to see it coming cuz you're aware of it because you've been talking about it, so you can identify it quickly and you can, uh, you can act in a way which is mostly to protect you and doing what's best for you, uh, but not in a selfish way, just uh . . . It's about self-respect. I think it is about discovering the nature of self-respect and how to live a life of self-respect, and that includes respect of other people, and that's kind of the, well, the skills I learned mostly about. 

00:46:15
MAUREEN MOORE That's, that's a really, really important point, that, sort of, being able to respect yourself and, and um, having that, that, the opportunity to, to increase that, you know, (crosstalk)in a difficult and challenging times to think to remind yourself, that um . . . 

00:46:30
DANIEL (crosstalk)Yeah. What you (crosstalk)truly are, yeah. 

00:46:35
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) . . . that, that you are valuable. 

00:46:35
DANIEL And when you look at those weaknesses, you do come to respect yourself automatically because you start to see the causes of them and why they, why they keep occurring, and then, once you've made a first step to change it, you suddenly respect yourself even more and you, and you reach a kind of point where you, you won't let the world take advantage of it, or, uh, of you or the world, you know. 

00:47:00
MARY So it's rather empowering when you finding your voice and actually having confidence in your voice is, you know, it's empowering and um, it changes your life, actually. 

00:47:10
DANIEL And you'll take, yeah, you do take more risks, as a result. 

00:47:10
MARY Yeah. 

00:47:15
MAUREEN MOORE It's, it's quite an interesting thing, uh, to, to think about. The, the other person, the person that you're talking to has a coun-, uh, who is a counselor, being someone who is very different to yourself and they might be different to you in all sorts of ways, from the very obvious to the, to the most subtle difference, whether it's, you know, simply a difference in heights, difference in gender, culture, race, belief, you know, you could go on and on and on. Has that impacted on anyone here, uh, the fact that you're working with someone that is just so different from yourself? 

00:47:55
WALT Well, I, I think I learned from, from that difference, and now that you mention it, I think back on it and I think to myself, yes, you were different, you had something that said, one: you can do it; two: it's within you to move on - it's that empowerment that you were talking about - you have that respect, that respect for yourself, so you have a different type of person, a person who actually can say something to you who is genuine, and then you go and you try it out and it works and is successful, and that seems to reinforce a little bit more for your belief, well, not your belief, but the relationship that says, "Hey, you can help me to help myself," so you move forward again. So yes, I think if the person was the same as myself then I wouldn't be sitting before him because we both have the same problems, so you have to be different from them. You have to be open and aware that something else exists. Yes, they have to be knowledgeable and experienced, I go along with that, but I don't want somebody who is the same as me. 

00:49:05
DANIEL In a way, it's better to have someone who's vastly different to you, I think, because uh, cuz uh, they, they can see through, they can see through, um, I mean, certain superficialities. I mean, the guy I saw was, you know, very straight-laced, old guy, you know, who was totally out of touch with uh, (crosstalk)the (ph)belly . . . 

00:49:25
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk)Watch it! Watch it. 

00:49:25
DANIEL He could ba-, he could barely write an e-mail, you know, but he could ju-, I think he could just about write an e-mail, and so explaining certain things to him is baffling, that kind of getting through to him was, was good, and, and he see through the things like what e-mail, and he could see, guess what was in the e-mail, for instance, you know, or why I was sending one in the first place rather than what exactly is . . . Um, or what I listen to or . . . Cuz, cuz . . . And it just, it does . . . I think if they're so much truly different you do kind of cut the, the (ph)kudos or whatever, you know, you cut through the rubbish and get to the . . . And uh, also, it gives more objectivity as well because they see you for, for, um . . . And being sort of indifferent to them, and uh, I can't, it's difficult to explain, but, I think, in the same way, I could probably help him with a few things, cuz, you know, I can, I can, I can see where he's going wrong, and the things he's getting caught up on that uh, I, I don't get caught up on, and that's what makes people different, I suppose, and you can see . . . 

00:50:25
MAUREEN MOORE It has been said that there are always two clients in the room. 

00:50:25
DANIEL Yeah. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:50:30
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk)So uh . . . 

00:50:30
DANIEL (crosstalk)I think that's, for s-, for sure. 

00:50:35
MAUREEN MOORE The counselors are often asked, "What did you learn from your client?" 

00:50:35
MARY Well, it's a relationship, isn't it? And I found that, you know, like you, um, I, I had to speak somebody that I felt could hear me, and therefore I, when I found somebody to be a counselor, I wanted somebody who kind of could understood where I was coming from, so I didn't want somebody that was, like, too different, because, like, you know, it would've been like a different language and that would've been too much hard work, you know? I wanted somebody that could actually share some of the values I share, and um, who could actually be a witness of me, you know, not just directing me, but actually just hearing me . . . 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:20
MARY . . . and watching me, you know, and, you know, respecting my story, because it was, I was going through my story, and um, I felt like I, you know, the gift was that I was heard. So we're all different and that's actually, uh . . . 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN It was, um, again, for me too, I needed someone who was slightly different, so there was some kind of, um, curiosity about them wanting to know what, what I was about, but also, somebody who could understand me. I wanted not too different, um, but someone who didn't make assumptions about me, didn't put me in box and, um, relating and tell me what to do, uh, because they believed I could do it . . . 

00:52:10
MARY Yeah. 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN . . . and somebody who could help me to understand why I felt helpless and how I could gain my strength back or find new strength. 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN And it, it does give you kind of a discipline though, I think, to um, to actually relay your stories to somebody who you haven't met before and who doesn't know any of your history or anything, and uh, and that in itself helps you to start unpicking all the tangles that you've got yourself into. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN And that's kind of what you were saying about finding your voice. I think that was quite powerful for me cuz, um, being part of a large for, family, it's quite easy to get lost in that, especially for someone who's caring for a lot of people, and to be able to give them that whole hour of just talking about myself and, and thinking about myself was just so empowering that, when I came out of the session, I couldn't stop talking about myself, so um, I almost went the other end for awhile, where I didn't want to hear other people's problems or things. I wanted to talk about me. 

00:53:25
MARY And there's finding a balance in that too. I mean, I, I first thought, "Oh gosh, it's quite indulgent," you know, and the, "I'm putting this time aside," but then, of course, there was a reason for it. 

00:53:40
DANIEL It's less indulgent than going to your family, I suppose, cuz they don't (ph)have (crosstalk)to listen to you. At least, at least when you've come out, you've got the skills to listen to them better than, better than they can listen to you. I think (crosstalk)that that's . . . 

00:53:50
MARY (crosstalk)Yeah. So you've got more in your toolbox when you come out of there, huh? 

00:53:55
DANIEL Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'd rather, I'd rather deal with that on my own or with a professional than to pour it on them and expect them to clean it up when I could, really, deal with 'em, my own problems, in order to, in order to help them and talk to them if they're not willing to do the same as me. 

00:54:10
MAUREEN MOORE So, Daniel, you're talking about respecting yourself more . . . 

00:54:15
DANIEL Yeah. 

00:54:15
MAUREEN MOORE . . . and, and, uh, that, that's a, a very um, a very powerful outcome? 

00:54:25
DANIEL Well, living a life of self-respect, really, not necessarily that being, self-respect being a key skill that you learned, but rather, learning a set of skills that allow you to live a life of self-respect and respecting, uh, everyone else, and acquiring it and giving it. 

00:54:40
MAUREEN MOORE All right, and somehow that, that connects with what, um, what you had said earlier on about caring for yourself. You cared for yourself a lot more and, and you also want, you were then also happy to talk more about yourself, whereas, perhaps, you were quite restrained or restricted before, so, uh, I wonder if you could say more about this self-care that . . . 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN I kind of, (crosstalk)um, I think I said I liked myself more, um, but that fits in quite closely with caring for myself, because I think I was so busy caring for everybody else that I was forgotten in that process, and, through counseling, I learned to like myself and care more for myself, um, and, and that kind of empowered me, um, and helped me to see myself as a really important person, in relation to everybody else, me coming first, and then everybody else. 

00:55:45
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) . . . (ph)you (ph)have (ph)facilitated? Some people would call that selfish, and, and they do get quite concerned. People do, in therapy, say, you know, "It makes me feel quite selfish," so how do we differentiate between (crosstalk)caring for yourself and being (crosstalk)selfish? 

00:56:00
DANIEL (crosstalk)There's a big difference. 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)I think, yeah, I think - sorry - I think you have to, um, it's one thing that I learned in counseling, you, you know, I needed to start caring about myself because, um, I needed to change my view of my life as well, and, and that's kind of what counseling helped me to do. It helped me, um, look after myself and care for myself and love myself more, and that had an effect on all the other things that I did and, and the other relationships that I had. 

00:56:30
DANIEL Cuz you can't truly care for anyone else if you don't truly care for yourself, and you could only ever care anyone as much as you, you care for yourself, really care for yourself, and if you think otherwise then you're, I suppose, diluted, really, I think, because uh, um, if you say you love, you love somebody and, um, um, more than yourself then it's, it's, it's not mutual, and uh, there's an imbalance there, and I think if you've tapped in a bit further, you'd probably see that it wasn't true, but I think if you truly could say that you, you had a love for yourself, and that doesn't mean, like, spoiling yourself or indulging yourself, but just valuing who you are and what you had and, who, who you know, have in your life, then you can uh, then you can start to, to love them, because it's . . . You can't know it, until you, you know it for yourself. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN I think counseling for me . . . Um, I learned a lot about myself, um, and things that I thought that I knew about myself weren't necessarily what I was actually like, so talking to a counselor helped me learn things and things . . . I learned things that I didn't like about myself as well as things that I liked about myself, but um, in order to change those things, you have to know what they are first, um, which, and then, helped me like myself better. 

00:57:45
MARY I think counseling helped me to move forward in my life too and to actually tie up, you know, to actually bury my husband. I, I . . . You bury, you bury something, you know, you bury a person, but you don't really, the relationship still goes on, so it was helping to closure. I learned that through actually being able to face it and face the situation and, and actually negotiate my way through, and I couldn't have done it on my own. I couldn't have . . . I don't . . . I can't imagine how I could've done it without . . . And that was actually caring for me, to actually give myself the time, the space, the witness to actually come to terms with very deep feelings that actually were, um, you know, challenging me in my life, and helping me to actually be able to move forward, and, actually, to even empower one, to actually . . . It's not what society says it is, or it has to . . . It's your own relationship with the past and with your future and you have a voice in that and it's okay. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. The talking about a burying or, I guess, in my experience, was about letting go . . . 

00:59:05
MARY Mm, same (crosstalk)thing. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) . . . and meant, or a letting go of people who I now see as hangers-on in my life, but at that point, I thought were really important people who gave me a lot of attention, cuz I was doing a lot for them. It wasn't the other way around. As I grew through counseling, I didn't need those people, and it was, um, quite challenging, cuz it was often said, "I, you're being selfish and you don't have time for us anymore and you don't care." Um . . . 

00:59:40
DANIEL It would've been all right if they had a little bit more time for you, so it was mutual. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, but it wasn't. It was the other way: it was a one-way relationship, so . . . 

00:59:45
DANIEL And it's difficult cuz you, you often like them. (crosstalk)You like to understand and you wanna help them if that's what it takes to be friends with 'em, but then, it's not, it's not fair, and it's not, and you know, you can't truly respect yourself if you're not, if that relationship is not being met and it's not mutual and they're not giving as much back where they can, because it's, it's uh . . . You really start to slip and you're not doing yourself justice at that point, so you do have to actually let go of people you like sometimes. 

01:00:10
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)I did. And that's really hard and challenging, because they've kind of made up, uh, a lot of things around me. There were structures which I had to break in order to move on. 

01:00:20
DANIEL Yeah. 

01:00:25
WALT It's funny, because you're, you're saying that, but I never thought of the word care, care for myself. I thought, "Well, I want to know me a little bit better." I guess it was that I wanted to care for myself deep down inside, or I would've never gone to counseling, and so - well, I've just noticed something just now - so therefore, I, I must have learned to care for myself a little bit more because I know myself more. 

01:00:50
DANIEL Yeah, and you can't really . . . You can start to care when you start to know about you and you start to work it out. 

01:00:55
MAUREEN MOORE Okay, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to stop. Thank you all very much for coming here today and for sharing your experiences of counseling so openly and genuinely with us and with the audience. I have learned a lot, and I hope everybody has, uh, from each other. You've mentioned things that are factors that are very important in the counseling relationship, like listening, honesty, confidentiality, being accepted as a person, being caring and helpful, not telling, not instructing. All of these things contribute to making the relationship what it is. Thank you very much for coming, and uh, it's been a very inspiring and um, inspirational, absolutely inspirational, um, discussion.
