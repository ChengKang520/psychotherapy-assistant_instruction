JOSEPH E. TRIMBLE  In putting together my presentation I, you know, I knew also well I'd be at Columbia so I would, I picked up different themes that had to do with what's presented in the literature that has some sort of connection with Columbia University. Well, as many of you know and now all of you will, this is my mantra, not mantra, this is something that I absolutely emphasize in my teaching and writing and lecturing. To quote that was uhm, actually attributed to William Fielding Ogburn who was a sociologist and anthropologist in the 20s here at Columbia. He was uh, Margaret Mead's mentor as well as Franz Boas and a few other people and Ruth Benedict's mentor. And, here were the 20's, "Never look for a psychological explanation un eff, less every effort to find a cultural one has been exhausted." 

00:01:35
JOSEPH E. TRIMBLE  When you look at the lite, whether it's a Cultural anthropology whether its Transcultural psychiatry, whether its psychology that works with different ethnic groups you'll find invariably that somebody has this theoretical orientation and then they tested out the some exotic strange population somewhere in the Amazon Basin, or in some ghetto somewhere around the world. Without coming to the realization that they're rather presumptuous in assuming that, that particular population doesn't have a way to explain what it was that uh, this person or group of individuals were looking for, so keep this in mind. My theme today is to take a look at the curriculum, to take a look at the instruction that's occurring in fields of psychology, sociology and to an extent anthropology that presents information as though its truth as though its factual. And this is occurring more and more in, in, in our field because we find more and more classes dealing with culture of this and the ethnicity of that and uh, uh, life ways and thought ways of this group of individuals and what we're finding, what I'm finding anyway, there's a lot of it isn't quite true, but it's being presented as that but I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm staying at the Excelsior Hotel oh, you may not know where that is and that's not important but it's right across the street from Museum of Natural History and Margaret Mead had her office in the Museum of Natural History right up in one of the towers and she stayed there for the better part of her career except when she was off (inaudible ). Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. I'm sure you've read or heard, someone say or the phrase say, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committee isn't, citizens can change the world indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." so, beautiful quote, that's attributed to Margaret Mead, she never said it. And when you look at the literature you'll find six different variations of that beautiful quote. Now, those who are (inaudible ) and thoughtful enough to reference that quote have picked sort of places where they think it might have been said or written. And when you note that, what you also note is that there's no page number, now how do I know this? I know this because Margaret Mead's daughter Mary Catherine Bateson was my office mate at Harvard and I had this quote on the wall (laughs) and she comes in one day and we visited a lot and she said uhm, "Joe, that's not what mom said. (laughs) As a matter of fact mom never said it." And then, and so we had a long conversation and so we started doing some research about it. But there's more to this story, in this series of slides, here is another example of what we can call the apocryphal or half truths. On 2001, the fantastic book came out that was scathing, Darkness in El Dorado How Scientist and Journalist Devastated the Amazon. Patrick Tierney spent several years, he is a dilutant amateur anthropologist journalist in the Amazon's looking and working with Yanomani or Yanomano tribe. That particular tribe was made famous by an Anthropologist named Napoleon Chagnon and everyone who seek(ph) in the Cultural Anthropology classes witnessed or watched The Ax Fight uh, that illustrates just how aggressive the Yanomani are and that they are aggressive according to Chagnon because of some social (inaudible ) principle. What tyranny did was find that now only was that classic film, The Ax Fight contrite but so as a lot of the data that Chagnon had put together and then popularized to the extent that it became known as a truth. When that book came out uh, the athro, American Anthropological Association was irate and convened all kinds of symposia to look at the, not only did the ethics of Chagnon's work but, but the impropriety of, of pus, putting forth data that's apocryphal at best. Well, a book has come out that's called Lost Paradises and that sort of says yeah, tyranny is correct and here are a number of scholars who, who uhm, validated that uh, contention uhm, tyranny himself has been taken over the calls, tyranny also talks about that researcher from University of Michigan who is now deceased, he was a biologist and geneticist to introduced the strain of measles called the Eisenhower strain of measles into the Yanomani to see how it would unfold. Didn't know that, did you? That was in the 50's. John Nance wrote a fascinating book called The Gentile Tasaday. A tribe of very primitive people living in the Mindanao region of the Philippines who hadn't changed any of their behaviors for thousands of years, use stone axes, et cetera, et cetera. And according to the anthropologist John Nance, the Gentile Tasaday, never knew war, never knew conflict, in fact in their language there was no word for war. So, hoax, the Philippines government ask these local people to act like they're living in a primitive way so that they could attract tourist to a remote region of the Northern Philippines. Needless to say, when the book came out and it wasn't that long ago it became very popular and the people say, isn't it amazing that a population of people can live in such gentile ways et cetera, et cetera, not true. In other words, they practice being member of this tribe when they would arrive early in the morning and spend the week and another week and say they'll go back to their farms and live with their families. Carlos Castaneda, hit the whole field of spirituality in a way that no one, nothing else had, had, had ever done before by talking about the way of the Shaman and of describing his experiences of working with an alleged Shaman called Don Juan were he, he learned how to enter an access the spirit world. Carlos Castaneda uh, got his Doctorate from, or received his Doctor in Anthropology from the UC, Univ from UCLA uhm, under the tutor, tutelage of Walter Goldschmidt, a prominent Anthropologist. It turns out that this dissertation was contrite, made up, compile from the series of ethnographic field reports from a number of people who had worked with Shaman in Central and South America. He never sided any of them and what Walter Goldschmidt found this out of course after the fact he was devastated that the whole world had been (Sigh) led to believe that this man who refused to seat for an interview by the way, he was no longer with us. I made it all up, if you wanna read about it, it's in the book called Shaman and Neo-Shaman. White lies about the Inuit is an interesting book that just came out that says, you know the story about Eskimos or Inuit people putting their elder on ice floes and sending them loose, uh-uh, never happen. Somehow other, these sorts of tidbits stories get made up and their so, so credible specially those who attached their names so that, that we will latch unto them and believe them. Well, what does this have to do with the introductory psych textbooks? Well, it turns out that a lot of people are latching on to this uh, topics, to this research writings without exploring them in word detail. But there's also another aspect here and that is, is there any resistance to infusing, here's my good friend Dr. Parkset(ph) the curriculum with culture diversity ethnicity and everything else that offends(ph) that. 2004 Uhm, the eth, ethic minority affairs release this book Toward an Inclusive Psychology: Infusing the Introductory Psychology Textbook With Diversity Content. I was one of the editors with Michael Stevenson and Judith Worell and it's the effort of about 20 people who put together this monograph. We thought it would be received with open arms, not quite. Not enough room in the textbooks for culture and ethnicity say some people, perhaps students especially North American students say some critics might lack the uh, constructs to accommodate cross-cultural material. Content can be too politically correct. It's a benign form of ethnocentrism et cetera, et cetera, et cetera as the slides shows you. So well, we may embrace in this audience and at this conference this idea that culture must be infused in the curriculum, there is resistance and it's just not in places like BYU and Oral Roberts University and other conservative institutions, it's other places too and uhm, I don't need to go in there. But, we need to talk about why some of this is, is not being challenge. That is to say, why isn't some of this information that we read here in the classroom and even professor ourselves. Well, I'm gonna lay, I'm gonna point the finger at the teaching of critical thinking skills, now look, critical thinking is an interesting subject and you ask somebody what it is and how you teach it and everyone's going to have an opinion about it. But it means standing from my perspective means standing apart from the world and establishing reasons and causes. This is a necessary aspect to practical reasoning, but is not su, sufficient for responsible judgment. So I'm contesting that education must also give students access to valued practices for encouraging the world more mindfully. Mindfully looking at something and saying, well this is interesting but it doesn't make sense to me and not stopping them. What are this, what is it, what are the skills and ac, uh, an application center associated with uh, with critical thinking? We, you know we're figuring something out or settling on the question, were trying to solve a problem and were doing it from the particular point of view and were looking at data and information and evidence uhm, were looking at concepts and ideas and were making inferences and interpretations and the implications and consequences that's pretty straight forward. We've all had this, this information sort of uhm, present it to us in one form or another. Uhm, not only in our instruction but now on practice. So, with this in mind, and some of the little observations that I have just made, let me launch in to three examples and I, of, I could speak here all weekend talking of problem(ph). And because of my own Amer, in my own American-Indian background I, I, I, I say this with apology I picture things that I'm, I that is to say a (inaudible ) because of the other ones that are most familiar uh, to me and so I say that with a bit of apology. But I'm hoping that you won't stop there that you'll take something in some other area and say, you know people have been saying this for a long time, is it true? So let me check it out, well, how many words do the Eskimos have for snow? Everyone in this room has heard this, everyone in this room has read it, not just in Cultural anthropology but in psychology and in, in linguistics and in socio-linguistics and I bet some of you have actually said this in your classes to students to make a point. It's a hoax. It's not true so let me tell you the story because the story in itself is absolutely fascinating. 1986, Woman Anthropologist at Cleveland State University said, "Eskimos have 500 words for snow." She thought, so she has decided to check this out, where did this come from? Who did the research? Who spent the time with the Eskimo, count the number of different words they, or the Lexicons they had in a (inaudible ) which is the basic dialects. So she (inaudible ) by a research and guess what she found. The counts varied from as few as 3 (laughs) to, to 400 in textbooks, no single figure. Wherever she found that there was no complete inventory, there were lack of accuracies and citation, the example was used to illustrate a variety of theories most notably the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis which essentially says that language shapes our world view, right? So, isn't it clever of the Eskimo who live in the flat thunder(ph) uhm, areas covered with snow 365 days a year that they would have a whole bunch of words for snow. Uhm, so what did she find, alright, and you know, you know, you know the drill, alright, uh Trimble in 1963 said, no that would have been too early uh, in 1975 said, so I go to Trimble in 1975 and I read the article or read whatever it is and then I follow it up, right? We check out the, the history of, of, of the references and then that's exactly what, what Laura Martin did but you know what she found that when she went to one reference this person or people reference somebody else earlier than them and when she went to that reference they reference somebody else earlier than them and so on and so on and so on and so on and so she you know got to 1959 Edward Hall classic book The Silent Language, he said they have a couple of words and he used it three times but didn't really references, (inaudible ) classic books and field by the way. Benjamin Lee Whorf's Science and Linguistics vague usage of the term, that book was published in 1940 he suggested there were five words but not the same set used as, uh, by, by Boas. Now, Franz Boas is certainly by, by every Anthropologist uhm, estimation count the sort of founder of Cultural Anthropology and he did it here at Columbia University and he in 1911 in his one of his book, one of his writings says there were four lexicons in Eskimo for snow. Okay, that's interesting but what some, what's even more interesting, he had never visit or spent any time with any of the Eskimos, (inaudible ) he ever got was (inaudible ) uh, uh, British Columbia, that's it. So what went on, and the story gets whoops, I'm getting ahead of myself(ph). You know its exotic, people are prepared to believe anything if its not familiar to them. So the grand lecture or some degree of possession of unique knowledge. Laura Martin compile her research findings and submit it to the, to the American Anthropologist and in one month receive a rejection. And the rejection letter said, this is not possible. This is such a well-known truth in the field of anthropology that your research must be flout. Undaunted, Martin goes back, rewrites it, does more research pretty much exhaust to literature resubmits it. In a month which is really kind of an unusual turn around time she gets another rejection only this little more tame. So she seek some consultation from a number of colleagues and finally the An, American Anthropologist decided to publish it as a uh, research report. You can read that article in that handout that supposed to be distributed available to the these people. By the way, everything that I'm talking about today is all reference uh, for you to follow up so I stand by. Now, I do a lot of work in the archive(ph), I spend a lot of time with different Eskimo and Inuit, Inuit populations. So many, many years ago, I was up in Ankritch(ph) and uh, a small meeting of Eskimo people and so I went to lunch you know, sitting around in the bunch of women from different villages sitting there so I went up and said, may I join? Oh, come on down, so I sat there and we ate and we visited and we talk story and told jokes and I everything so finally I said, I have a question for you, how many words do you have for snow? (laughs) And they just burst out laughing so this elderly woman said, well, le, let's, let me talk about it so they immediately run into their languages and you know(ph) it such a cacophony of noises, it was really kind of beautiful to hear. They were going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and uh, finally the woman said, well, we have concluded that we have just as many words in our language as, as you do in English for snow, and that was the end of it. (laughs) Don't use the example, its not true. Sort of like saying that those are possibility(ph) in Seattle have 300 words for rain, because of waste(ph), (laughs) and so it goes. Margaret Mead, as you know, uhm, actually Margaret Mead started out wanting to be a psychologist here at Columbia but uh, took a couple of classes in Anthropology and was intrigued by this new merging field of Cultural Anthropology. Margaret Mead's dissertation was conducted in uh, Ta'u which was one of the island groups in Samoa. It was subsequently published in 1928 in uh, revolutionary book that just set the whole field of Psychology, Psychiatry, Anthropology on its tale. Coming of age in Samoa, a psychological study of primitive youth for western civilization. She tested, Franz Boas concept of linguistic determinism and of course uh, not of course but it also challenged some of the emerging uhm, controversies surrounding the field of eugenics. Well, she interviewed 50 females from three villages in Ta'u and she describes them in this controversial book as a very casual, gentle, untroubled, unstressed, regroup center didn't emphasize individual and individualism as (inaudible ), you can read about this and she did uh, strives them(ph) as a large family community to seems to ensure the child against the development crippling attitudes of, that have been labeled with edible complexes. It goes on also to say that sexual experiences were free that boys and girls were free to engaged in sexual behavior exploration uhm, at the religion book(ph) like in '28 in United States, New England that didn't go over really well. But, it became a truth. It became a wonderful example of what life is like in the society that doesn't play stress pressure on adolescence that doesn't emphalize, emphasize individualism and they grow to be mature et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Margaret Mead became a star. In fact, she hired an agent, (laughs) serious uh, the first day Anthropologist to do it, to manage all her, her financial affairs. Well, became part of the uhm, literature and when child development topics came along the lecturer said, and Mead found in her early fieldwork in Samoa that you know, hush goes over the classroom, they engaged in sex without any ambitions, God(ph). Well, along comes an Australian Anthropologist by the name of Derek Freeman. (inaudible ), Australia, publishes a book in 19 uhm, 83 Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmake, Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth. In his book he attempts to disprove Mead rather than explain Samoan culture and calls into question the scientific integrity, he also, and, calls into question uhm, Franz Boas ethical integrity which is still being debated. Freeman argues that a culture cannot purge itself of aggression. So, to substantiate his point he identified Samoan informants, of course, many, many decades later who disagree with Mead's findings and he goes on to say in a re-contentious way that Mead exaggerated the shallowness of the individuation. The book was controversial. Freeman was controversial. In fact, some people branded him as a narcissist and he was you know, Mary Catherine Bateson didn't(ph) exactly like him, (laughs) and so, we had some wonderful conversations about Derek Freeman. Derek Freeman had this data before Margaret Mead died and chose not to release the book until she passed away. Never given her the opportunity to argue with him, so, her students did it for her. Well, that controversy range on. Mead says, "they were the least contentious and most people, pip, most peaceful peoples of the world." Freeman says, "a people amiable in peace but highly prone to outbreaks of violence and given to ferocious butchery in war." Annette Weiner who is one of Margaret Mead's uh, students says, "Freeman's book in its history, in its ethnography, and as a scientific refutation fails, (Sighs) and so, the debate goes on. I'll point out a few more things here. Freeman was bold enough to say that he was adopted into one of the Samoan units and actually appointed as a Honorary Chief. My Samoan colleague say, uh-uh, that doesn't happen. So, here we go, fictitious information being used subs, tabs, substantiate a, a contention of some of the, work that Margaret Mead did at the right page(ph) of 22 uhm, in the early 20's in the remote island of Ta'u in Samoa. Well, what's interesting is at 1958 an Anthropology student by the name of Lowell Holmes actually decided to replicate Margaret Mead's findings. A male of course, therefore, might come up with some different findings since he were to be interviewing women not necessarily but, but one's(ph) needs to bring that into the conversation and he replicated the study but he fail to do it but you know what, he published it in the small little journal article and nothing, nothing was said about it. All the while that this was going on '58, '83 the literature was still siding 1928 findings of Margaret Mead as still they were true. So, a book was written by uhm, Martin Orans, 1983 entitled Not Even Wrong, Margaret Mead, Derek Freeman and the Samoans, interesting book. Page one, I'm so (inaudible ) by saying look, occasionally a message carry by the media finds an audience so eager to receive it that it is willing to spend all critical judgment and adopt the message as its own. So it was with Margaret Mead's celebrated 'Coming of Age in Samoa.' Even when you step back, either its uh, willing to accept it. Orans goes on to say Ma, Mead's failures were partly that of cultural anthropology then and now; she did not make her claims clear enough to be tested and she did not present sufficient or adequate representative data support her generalizations. Has she met these requirements of ordinary scientific practice, whatever her predilections regarding culture and and biology, she could not without falsifying have written the rather misleading account that she did. Yet, it was accepted as truth. Why? Why didn't somebody step back and say, "Wait a minute." Well, Holmes did but he didn't, he was not interested in promoting himself but Freeman did or so he thought he did but was much, much more interested in promoting uh, his agenda. Let me move to one that's gonna knock your socks off. Titled Blackfoot influences on the Psychology of Abraham Maslow. This uh, two gentleman here, this is uh, Ryan Heavy Head, Narcisse Blood dear friends of mine. They are both uhm, members of the uh, Blackfoot Tribe, Blackfoot nation in Cartston(ph) Alberta, Canada. Uh, Narcisse is a very (inaudible ) a younger picture of (inaudible ), by it (laughs) uhm, he's an elder like me and his hair is gray and all of those stuff. Ryan is uh, an Anthropologist, studied at the University of Lethbridge. He's a member of tribe, he's (inaudible ) language that goes to the sun dances (inaudible ). Several years ago, Ryan was reading Abraham Maslow's book that dealt with self-actualization. He was intrigued by it, not being a psychologist the odds of him coming at classes were not, were not good. So as reading this, got to talking with some people, I started reading this fascinating stuff and there were some elders in the room when he was talking about it and they said, "What was that guy's name?" Maslow, Abraham Maslow they all looked at one another and they said, " Wasn't that the man who resi, visited our reserve in the summer of 1938? So, Ryan got curious and as he was reading through this works of self-actualization one of the things that picked his curiosity well, where did this guy, this psychologist from Brooklyn College, Brooklyn not too far away (inaudible ), uh, come up with these ideas? When he had been trained as a Watsonian behaviors up until 1937? And as he was reading through it, he said wait a second(ph), "You know this sounds very familiar to me." And he read the text and people would do this and do this and when he gotten the whole section about self-actualization, this is really strange. A little bit of backdrop(ph). This is Abraham Maslow, really very far in standing(ph) there. Ruth Benedict was here in the Anthro Department in, in the 30's and Ruth would convene prominent Anthropologist who would come through the city, she would have them over her house for dinner and Margaret Mead of course (inaudible ) among others with, wo, would be in attendance and Maslow started to heard about this and, and, and he became acquainted with Ruth Benedict and, and uh, one thing led to another and Ruth said to uh, Maslow, you know, why don't you go spend some time living on uh, Indian reservation to learn about how other cultures live and that might help, you kind of some understanding about some of the things you're thinking about. Wonderful idea, so he gets a grant uh, from the Social Science Reserves Council that sponsors a trip to a reserve somewhere in the United States. Because Margaret Mead uh, was friends with a woman named uhm, Jane Richardson, she's right over here who was a fieldworker who was working on the Blackfoot reserve. She, Benedict suggested that Maslow contact her and make arrangements to spend the summer of 1938 on the reserve. Also, uh, the man named uhm, Lucian Hanks uhm, you will see Jane Hanks because they kind of fell in love while they were on the reserve and that's another story retrieved but I'll leave that (inaudible ) anyway. Uhm, so here is Lucian Hanks and Blackfoot I mean uhm, Maslow goes to Chicago, they get an old beat-up car and they drive West on the old Dustindirk(ph) Roads in the 30's and end up Cartston(ph) which rather a remote area and he spent six weeks there and here is some photos of that two substantiated. Okay? He almost got run off, he was rather insulting, never done fieldwork before but you know, Jane and Lucian would call (inaudible ) come down you know and so forth and so forth. He interviewed people, he attended the sun dance uhm, which was rather unique uhm, and then uhm, some very interesting things happen uhm, he actually conducted an interview with an informant. I have a copy of it. I found it at the Glenbow Archives and Museum in Alberta, in Calvary in fact and it was one of those sort of unique(ph) moments I was told it existed you know how research is, you get going on it, you can't stop and finally you find it, and I'll never forget the moment. So this is the actual transcript of an interview, we had with a man named Tony Crane Bear, it was sort of a general, sort of ethnographic interview but let me read you how Maslow phrased his questions. Listen carefully. You have child? Ever married? Tell me. He do (inaudible ) et cetera. Somebody needed to give him a few lessons about how to conduct an ethnographic interview with native people but that's another story. Well, uhm, Maslow must have been affected by his experiences there because he wrote about many years later and he says in one of his writings and commentaries with respect to self-esteem, it was found that a completely different quality of self-esteem was found in about 80-90% of the Blackfoot tribe, a quality that is found in only about 5-10% of our population, it was an interesting observation. It would seem that every human being and we listen to this and read this carefully, it would seem that every human being comes at birth into society not as a lump of clay to be molded by society, but rather as a structure which society may wrap or warp or suppress or build upon. My fundamental idea supporting this feeling is that my Indians were first human beings and secondly Blackfoot Indians, and also that in their society I found almost the same range of personalities as I find in our society et cetera. You know all the wordings kind of annoy a few of us but uhm, he did, did observe some things. He also said that in one of his writings that their strong characters, self-respecting men. They were tough. If you watched to see how they developed this, I think it was through greater respect for their children. Now, reflecting back on all of this, one of the Blackfoot elders not long ago said, "Now it may, may be that in his writings, later on, he began to think back on things. He was not unobservant. So, where am I taking this and where is Ryan taking this and where is Narcisse taking this? He appropriated their world here and didn't give them credit. They're aren't being polite by using word appropriated, he stole it because what Ryan and his, and his eldered, and the elders that, at the reserved did would take concepts right out of Maslow's books on self-actualization et cetera and line them up with phrases and got ways that li, that, that, that re, reflective of the Blackfoot world view about child rivalry(ph), about relationships among family et cetera, et cetera. And what you find is a match(ph), so, have your(ph) head gets a grant from the Canadian government goes to Brooklyn College? Looks at Maslow's archives and goes to Brandeis were he finished his career and gets into their archives no reference at all. The he tries again a hold of Maslow's private films(ph) and diaries about the 1938 experience in the family and said, no way. Let me go on, take a look at this. Before(ph) I was talking about symbolism. Do you ever think why was this notion of hierarchy needs depicted as a pyramid which is kind of like what teepee looks like. I'll leave you with that. Now, what's what, what's being said here, if you go to uh, the web page of the Red-Pro(ph) Community College uh, in Cartston(ph), Alberta you will read this, by the way their word for themselves is Siksika so, that's what that word means and you can substitute the word Blackfoot for it. "These contributions gathered from Siksika have shaped the disciplines of psychology, education, and management as we know them today. But Maslow's understanding of the concepts and practices he encountered were, were hindered by his unfamiliarity with their world view that's what that means. He could not speak the language, knew next to nothing about the philosophical and spiritual traditions, and neglected entirely to consider the role of 'place' in Blackfoot social development." What he did managed to accumulate in six weeks was sufficient to change his world view and led to a career that led to the development of humanistic psychology. Why didn't somebody say, "Where did Maslow get this stuff from?" How many of you knew that Maslow spent six weeks on the Blackfoot reserve in 1938? Nobody, one, it's an untold story but now you know it and now you know another part of the way you can inbu, talk about self-actualization if indeed you do at all. The infamous, notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment went on for 40 years, 40 years pub, sponsored by the Public Health Service. Principal(ph) investigators were all physicians who graduated from University of Virginia, if you will look into that, you'll find out that the cornerstone or philosophy of the curriculum at Med School of University of Virginia was launched(ph) in eugenics. So, and you do a little background research on principal(ph) investigators who were, put this study forward and had it funded(ph) for 40 years to find out some very interesting details. Now, my question for you is, why did it take somebody, 40 years to blow the whistle? Why didn't somebody come forth and say, "This is horrendous." Now, it wasn't in that literature but it's an example of critical thinking and it took this man, Peter Buxtun, he kept going, going, going and say, you've got to stop to study, it's unethical, it's immoral, it's unjust, wouldn't. So, he quit and he moved to San Francisco and he finally said, "I got to get this off my conscience(ph) the public, the world needs to know about it so he calls up a reporter (inaudible ) Washington Post and says, I've got a story for you, sit down(ph). And the next day, hit the wire services and et cetera, et cetera worldwide. And as some of you know this has led to IRBs, Human Subject Reviews, the establishment of an ethics center within National Institutes of Health in which I am part among, among many, many other things. Why? Surely, some, a lot of people over of the span of a, uh, uh four yea, four decades knew this and didn't say anything.

JOSEPH E. TRIMBLE  You all know Eric, Ericsson right? Of course, Childhood and Society that, that book was based on his ethnographic fieldwork in my home community on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, now I was not there when he was, in fact, I was very little and so I wouldn't been uh, part of the study. But this is what he did, he ask children to tell him and his research associates from Cambridge(ph) what they, what they dreamt about. Oh, well, this(ph) little children will go home and say, mom, dad, grandpa this white-haired man from Back East is asking me to tell him my dreams and you know we can't do that, that we only tell our dreams to special people (inaudible ), the holy man. So, the parents would tell the children, well, you know you have to respect this man so make something up(ph), (laughs) and they all did. Well, he carefully wrote it down, interpreted all this dreams from the(ph) psychoanalytic perspective and wrote it up. So, when you read about the Lakota or Sioux as he calls them and how they view child-bearing and breastfeeding and this and that and everything else, (laughs) you, you don't know that the people were being really polite but they weren't exactly telling him the truth but they couldn't tell him the truth because of uh, respect for cultural circumstances so there's that element that, that has to be acknowledge them, I don't know it's, some people will say to me (inaudible ), you're not ready to know this yet. Of course, when you first hear that from an elder, from uh, uh, a (inaudible ) you kind of a little bit offended. When am I gonna be ready? So when you ask that question you'll know it's the answer you get(ph). So, you know what(ph) that whole experience of getting information it, it, you're not sure if you're really being, being told the truth uhm, we call it an old Indian trick the uhm, the ancestor learned a long time ago not to take things for their face value (inaudible ) for a few, for a few bucks and (inaudible ).

JOSEPH E. TRIMBLE What I challenged you to do is to think about some other things that you teach and maybe have that really looked into, into more detailed to see if what it is you're teaching is in fact true. One of the slides that uh, the first slide where I show those examples I neglected to point out that, what's fascinating, look into textbook covers in culture anthropology and in our field and to picked or intend to show the potential buyer or reader or user that this book is all about culture and look at the stereotypes that editors from publishing houses try to get us to put other book covers. Classic one is to show a lot of faces of different people and that suppose to mean that we're talking about culture of the book. Going back to, to Laura Martin's article on the American psychology she ends with a cautionary tale, she says, the intellectual protection to be found in the careful use of sources, the clear presentation of evidence, and above all, the constant evaluation of our assumptions". That's critical thinking and if we continually engage in that we might, ma, might not be perpetuating to miss the half-truths epocryphal that we find so fascinating in the textbooks and in writing(ph). What Geoffrey Pullum in an interesting book called the Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax and Other Irreverent Essays, a little bit more harsh about this (inaudible ) and I kinda like what he said in 1991, "the tragedy is not that so many people got the facts wildly wrong; it is that in the mentally lazy and anti-intellectual world we live in today, hardly anyone cares enough to think about trying to determine what the facts are." So I leave you uh, with that interesting thought, thank you for attentiveness and your patience. (applause)
