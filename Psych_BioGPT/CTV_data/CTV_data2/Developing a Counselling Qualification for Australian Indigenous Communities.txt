BETTY CONNELLY My name is Betty Connelly, my position at Relationships Australia is Cultural Mentor and Counsellor and my co-worker is Penny Coulter and Penny is our project officer for the Diploma of Counseling & Group Work. First of all, I'd like to say on behalf of Penny and myself, we take this opportunity to acknowledge and pay our respect to the traditional owners of this land, on which we meet today.

BETTY CONNELLY Today's presentation focuses on the project which we call the, Diploma of Counselling & Group Work and what I’d like to do is just highlight key points which we have six. Prior to doing that, I want to say what we have achieved is to bring together traditional cultural practices and modern theory in a unit program designed to open up employment and educational opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The first of the key points is community initiatives, capacity building, validation of existing skills which is a key important thing within a program, the importance of relationships.

00:01:30
BETTY CONNELLY ...and where to next. So what we did within the diploma, we said, we needed to have the seeds planted so we could start growing and we grow together. 

00:01:45
'The Seeds have been planted'... 

00:01:45
FIRST THERE WAS A NEED IDENTIFIED BY 

00:01:45
THE COMMUNITY 

00:01:45
* 2005 :MANNIES GROUP: Elders in the ACT 

00:01:45
came together and identified the need for 'more 

00:01:45
black counsellors and 'Mediators' and 'facilitators'. 

00:01:45
THEN THERE WAS A VISION 

00:01:45
2008: WOMEN SPEAK GATHERING 

00:01:45
* the community raised the idea again that there is a gap 

00:01:45
in accessing qualified counsellors in the community. 

00:01:45
*Betty Connelly approached Relationships Australia. 

00:01:45
'The only way Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander men and women could support other 

00:01:45
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women, was to obtain a qualification.' 

00:01:45
BETTY CONNELLY So first there was a need identified by the community. In 2005, I met with a group of women elders and I said to them, I said, okay, what do you say the issues in our community that have not been addressed. And they pointed out three. They said we don't have any qualified black counsellors, black mediators and black trainers and facilitators. I said, okay then, well, let's take a journey together. So in 2008 I approached Mary Pekin, who was our CEO at Canberra Relationships Australia and I said, look, would you like to come on an adventure with us. It's a unique approach, totally it’s initiative and it's thinking outside the box of how mainstream service providers can provide service to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. So Mary was very keen and everyone else came on board at Relationships Australia. And at a women's group gathering that we had in 2008 in Canberra, it was raised -- the idea was raised again and um, yea, you know, what we were saying, which you could see up there, the only way Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women could support our own community was to obtain a qualification. 

00:03:05
IN THE BEGINNING....... 

00:03:05
* Relationships Australia, led by Betty 

00:03:05
Connelly took the idea to the community 

00:03:05
and received overwhelming support from 

00:03:05
both NGOs and Government departments 

00:03:05
* The diploma was supported by more 

00:03:05
than 20 community partners providing in- 

00:03:05
kind and financial support. 

00:03:05
* MARCH 26 2009: 21 students walked into the 

00:03:05
class room to begin the Diploma, many 

00:03:05
of whom were supported by their employer. 

00:03:05
* The students came together every Monday night. 

00:03:05
and some weekends for 18 months 

00:03:05
"Really happy to walk in the room. All our mob in one room. Every week to walk in after work. 

00:03:05
It felt like home" 

00:03:05
BETTY CONNELLY So we went on this journey, we started it. And we started talking which is really good because I believe that the key fact in anything is communication. So the diploma, we advertized it and 21 students walked into the door of Relationships Australia. Now, I have to admit there was -- never before had this happened. So the staff were a little bit just looking at us walking in and -- no, no, this isn’t going to work, the way students walked in, we said, oh, what we’re going to do, we're going to be doing the right thing, how we’re going to go about doing it. So 21 students walked in, in 2009, the course is 18 months and Penny will explain further on that. But, yes, there was 17 of us that graduated in 2010 -- July 10, 2010 last year. So we came together every Monday night for three hours and that went for 18 months. We also attended six weekend residentials and we had a work placement which equated to be 20 days within that 18 months. A couple of the comments that the students made when we were telling them what we were putting together was, really happy to walk in the room. All our mob in one room. And every week to walk in after work it felt like home, because we had one goal and that was to obtain a qualification, so we could go out and work for that community members and to begin the healing. So I'm going to hand you over to Penny now and Penny can talk to you about what does the diploma look like.

"It's a two way street; we are learning from each other. It is a partnership" 

00:05:10
PENNY COULTER Thanks Betty. Now people ask what the diploma actually does look like and whether it's any different to a mainstream qualification. Essentially, the Diploma in Counselling and Group Work is AVETAB accredited and has three Relationships Australia, New South Wales. So out there we've got the Australian Institute of Relationship Studies. So essentially as you can see up there, there are seven modules. So it goes through basic to more advanced counselling skills. There is also a group leadership training, also the really important stuff for the community which is a self reflection module, so the self as counselor, boundaries, ethics, training and also how you can look after yourself when you go back to the community. As Betty said there's also a 20-day placement which I'll talk a little bit more about later. The only thing really that differentiates the diploma itself from the mainstream qualification is the cultural lens that we use. So every week when the students come together, every module that we would go through would be taken back to the students, and we'd have scribes there and we are madly writing down every comment that came back, because that's the only way that you’re going to make it a culturally relevant course the whole time, keeping the mainstream theory within them. Now, yesterday I was going to(ph) one of the presentations by Clive and one of the questions he asked is whether or not a diploma is enough. And that's a very, very important question in particularly when you’re thinking about the cultural aspects as well, when you think about access and equity and I guess as Betty was saying that's how this diploma came about. Definitely it's a big yes, a diploma is enough, it's a great start. And a little bit later we'll talk about the pathways that we've created into higher education, that's come specifically because the students have undertaken the diploma which has been a really great outcome as well. 

00:07:00
Language and Therapeutic Frameworks 

00:07:00
Redefining and 'Re-languaging' Key Competencies 

00:07:00
*Exchanging Language: A natural exchange of Mainstream versus Community language. 

00:07:00
*Therapeutic frameworks are examined: 

00:07:00
Psychoanalytic Theory 

00:07:00
Attachment Theory 

00:07:00
Client Centered Therapy 

00:07:00
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 

00:07:00
Bowen Family Systems Theory 

00:07:00
Narrative Therapy 

00:07:00
Solution Focused Therapy 

00:07:00
PENNY COULTER Now, probably the most unique outcome as well that's come from this has been the need that was identified to re-language the course. Essentially, as Betty said, it is a mainstream course. So the students would all come together, and when you’re going through the mainstream theory, they would always say to us, this isn't how we work, this is how we would describe that, so within each of the modules and theoretical components. So there was always an opportunity to re-language. And for us, as an organization and as trainers that brings on something very important which Betty will talk about later is cultural competency. So as I said each of the modules were re-languaged every week and it makes us accountable as a mainstream service who is going to be working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities which has been really important. As you can see out there, each of the therapeutic frameworks that we use included good old Freudian psychoanalytic theory right through the Narrative and Solution Focused, which I’ll ask Betty to talk a little bit about later. I guess one of the things as a trainer and as a mainstream worker is to think about the issues that are in the community which obviously, we’ve got listed on your right there, so the alcohol and other drugs, suicide, trauma, particularly family violence and child protection issues. For a mainstream worker, quite often we’re on the outside looking into that stuff, but for our students they're in the community and one of the first things we told that it's 24/7 for them. So they were coming into this course to get some validation for some life experience and many of the workers had been there for 20 to 30 years doing this kind of work. So we were always asking is this working for you always doing an ongoing evaluation and also we need to know how can we make this better and the students have to be a part of that. So probably back to Betty and Betty will talk about why the diploma is important and how it's worked. 

00:09:10
Why is the Diploma important? 

00:09:10
Graduates will: 

00:09:10
* gain a mainstream professional counselling 

00:09:10
qualification. 

00:09:10
* become eligible for accreditation with the 

00:09:10
Australian Counselling Association (ACA). 

00:09:10
* establish new career path and education 

00:09:10
opportunities previously inaccessible. 

00:09:10
* be eligible to enter the SocialWorks degree at 

00:09:10
Australian Catholic University. 

00:09:10
* have their existing skills recognized and 

00:09:10
validated. 

00:09:10
* have the opportunity to take their skills back to 

00:09:10
their communities.

00:09:10
BETTY CONNELLY Okay. Well, for us, we wanted to gain a mainstream qualification and if anything the diploma gave us that opportunity that this was the first step. The other thing was we found that us, as aboriginal people, we would not access any mainstream higher education facility, I mean, like university, like Taif because what we had encountered over a number of years was that racism, and that's not -- I'd rather land with my own mom than learning mainstream. So that was a key factor as well. The students that were in the group, we were all aboriginal, we had one Torres Strait Islander domain and the whole idea with the diploma was, my vision have been, let's make it a portable, a transportable model that can be taken to any community, whether we’re large aboriginal communities. But not only that, this could also be used for any other cultural group within their community. As example, the coal community, up in Canberra, one of our ladies that works in Walda,(ph) she turned around and she said to me, well, I cannot do the course. And I said, well, you’re not aboriginal. I said but, you know, if you felt that there was a strong sense that the coal workers in the community needed to have something similar to what we have, I said well, this is where we need to negotiate, go to East and say, okay, we want to make this diploma specifically for coal workers. And the only thing that is changing, the diploma itself is all mainstream – pardon me, the only thing that we change is the cultural competencies, and to have all aboriginal workers, community members that are learning together, that was a prime factor as well. And the cultural competencies is so, so important. And so when we look at, as I said, to gain a mainstream professional counselling qualification, we became then eligible to apply to a professional body which was the Australian Counseling Association. It also help us to establish new career path and educational opportunities previously that were inaccessible. To be eligible to enter the Social Work Degree at the Australian Catholic University, we negotiated with them, looking at what pathways that we could develop. And once I -- what happened was one of our full-time students, one of our students from last year that graduated with me, she is a young mom, she wanted to do full-time study first time ever and, like 30s, and so she started studying her first year of the Social Work Degree at the Catholic University and she's absolutely loving it. And the pathway there is that you do two years full-time. So next year she'll do her second-year and everything going well, she'll graduate the year afterwards. So that is a really good, that's a good pathway. And we're also working with the University of Canberra with their counselling courses that they have over there. The key thing was to have our existing skills recognized and validated. I’ve been sent as a community councilor for over 30 years in my community and other communities and but I never had the piece of paper. And that was a thing that went around all of us that we didn’t had the white man’s piece of paper. So we felt if we could get these piece of paper, the diploma, this is the start of the journey of healing for not only us as community members, but also what we could put back to our community and also to have the opportunity to take their skills back to their community.

00:13:30
(2010) 

00:13:30
BETTY CONNELLY So when we look at the bridging, two ways of thinking. Craig & Libby Brown, they have their own aboriginal counselling service in New South Wales. I'm quite proud of the fact that Craig is my nephew, he is my older brother’s son, and that had always been his vision. So him and Libby are both going on. I think he is doing -- he is in his last year of psychology and the same with Libby. And then we have Kathryn & David Geldard. They came down and Mary spoke to them about what the diploma was about, just I wouldn't want to -- want to be associated with what the diploma was. And we actually use their book, the basic counseling skills as the mind book that we used. 

00:14:30
WHY HAS THE DIPLOMA WORKED? 

00:14:30
fantastic engagement and retention of the students. We started off with 22 

00:14:30
and 17 graduated in 2010. In 2011 we started with 17 students and 14 

00:14:30
will graduate. 12 students will graduate in Wagga Wagga. 

00:14:30
HOW DID WE SUPPORT IN RETAINING OUR STUDENTS? 

00:14:30
* The idea came from the community and ownership has been and

Sustainability of program beyond 

00:14:30
We have been successful in receiving ongoing financial support from 

00:14:30
Department of Education, Employment & workplace Relations (DEEWR) 

00:14:30
and ICT Government. 

00:14:30
BETTY CONNELLY So when we look at why has the diploma worked, there was a fantastic engagement and retention of the students. We started off with 22, 17 graduated in 2010. In 2011, this year, in Daikin, we started with 17 students and 14 will graduate. And Wagga Wagga is a part of our region, so we have 12 students that will -- that started there and will graduate as well. So when we looked at how did we support in retaining our students, it was because the idea came from the community, that wasn't something that was just forced upon us, the idea raised from the community. So then we ended up taking ownership of it and looking at, we’ve got the main structure here, now we’re just going to add to it and renovate just like a house. You want it, you renovate it and make it to what you want. So that was the success of it. And this, once again, if it's taken to any other community, that’s because the community has taken control of it. And so the ownership is going to be 110% all the time. What we did was, there was two positions that were created and that is my position. So I work five days a week, four days as cultural mentor, one as counsellor. And then we have Krista Darsy(ph) who is a co-worker, she is the student liaison officer within the diploma, it was a provision on one-on-one support by the trainers, counsellors and staff, it was a flexible learning model as well. Students, we all supported each other and we guided the trainers in the areas of the cultural competency. Sustainability of the program beyond the public status, we have been successful in receiving ongoing financial support from the Department of Education, Employment, and Workplace Relations which is called DEEWR and the ICT government. 

00:16:45
WHY HAS THE DIPLOMA WORKED? (con.) 

00:16:45
*Capacity building and collaboration in between community 

00:16:45
partners and Relationships Australia, improving accessibility 

00:16:45
and employment opportunities for graduates. 

00:16:45
*Ongoing Evaluation eg: Goolabri Weekend 

00:16:45
-Evaluating the practical application of theory within a 

00:16:45
naturally relevant framework. 

00:16:45
-Students are encouraged and given the opportunity to 

00:16:45
contribute to ongoing content development. 

00:16:45
-This will mean developing culturally relevant resources, 

00:16:45
reading materials, exercises & activities for future students. 

00:16:45
BETTY CONNELLY The key thing that we wanted to do was to capacity build. And if we could do this, it was going to be a milestone particularly in Canberra, that finally we had Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that had a qualification, even though it's looking at entry level skills in counselling, it's still got to be something. So it was a collaboration as well. We have a really great relationship with Relationships Australia that also lay other services because they come on board as mentors. And so we had about 20 other community partnerships within the diploma. The program itself has always been an ongoing evaluation and at the Goolabri Weekend that we had that prior to graduating in July last year and a lot of things came out of that. That was very positive and we all said we’ve completed halfway of our journey. So students are encouraged and given the opportunity to contribute to the ongoing content development and we still do that today. And so we’re also looking at because when we looked at counselling techniques, so we can sit there and have a look at how do you counsel, we didn't find any within Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander content. So we thought to ourselves when we do have our own place, if they’re good enough, we’d like to turn them into a resource. Add books on that, we’d like to turn that into a resource. One of resource that was done in Wagga, was over the 18 months quite a few learned and we ended up having Iguana and that was fantastic. So Iguana that way, it was a jigsaw puzzle, but it also gave us time, that when we looked at a place, we reflected on what we did, what could be done better. So resources like that, we wanted to really start developing and put it out there because we’re also being asked by our co-workers, particularly at our (inaudible ) services, there is nothing called Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander counselling techniques. So that's what we're looking at doing within our diploma. So do you have a little? 

00:19:15
PENNY COULTER Yeah. 

00:19:15
BETTY CONNELLY Yeah. So I hand you over to Penny and Penny can talk about the partnerships and work placement. 

00:19:20
Partnership: Work Placements 

00:19:20
"As partners in it we also learned, particularly 

00:19:20
enhancing cultural awareness, as we talked with 

00:19:20
course students about different cultural ways of 

00:19:20
caring for people in our communities when they’re 

00:19:20
going through hard times, and the context that shape 

00:19:20
how we do this. We may use different language and 

00:19:20
sometimes different ways yet there's also alot in 

00:19:20
common, and this was enriching for all of us". 

00:19:20

00:19:20
community partner application.

PENNY COULTER Thanks, Betty. Okay, so I suppose one of the questions we get asked is how has this worked on a community level, and like everyone from all the organizations you represent, you would have your community partners. We’ve built base for over ten years, we’re really, really lucky actually that we had a partnership existing with the four main Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander services. The way that came about was denied(ph) again and the skill level, the gap was recognized in the community, so they would come to Relationships Australia, refer clients to us, but also we would do outrage therapeutically run groups, have one-on-one sessions at each of these, orgs. Now one of the things that did come from the partnership which was unique was essentially a swap with staff. So one of the services actually released, two of their workers to come, who have done the course and graduated from the course to come and work as therapist at Relationships Australia in an intern start program. That worked really, really well, we're hoping to continue doing that. We have employed five of our graduates at Relationships Australia at the moment as therapists, which is fantastic. One thing as I said is that, it was taken to the community back in 2005, 2008 so this has been an ongoing process, got 22 community partners we hold community partner meetings to let them know how everything is progressing. I just wanted to read out a quote that you can see that from one of our counsellors who provided clinical supervision. She says, as partners in it we also learned, particularly enhancing cultural awareness, as we talked with co-students about different cultural ways of caring for our people in communities when they’re going through hard times, and the context that shape how we do this. We may use different language and sometimes different ways yet there is also a lot in common and this was enriching for all of us. And I think that's one of the key things that we definitely felt as trainers as well, we – quite often we’re doing this work anyway. So this has just provided forum I guess, for us all to come together and provide that qualification for a lot of the work that was already being done in the community. So I hand back to Betty.

BETTY CONNELLY Thanks, Penny. So the next slide we’ll show and this is outside the hill, and honestly we would and you'll see slide where we actually wore the cap and gowns and for most of us we never did that and that was always a dream for us to do. So over there, yes, wearing our cap and gowns, and over here, and the T-shirts that you see Penny and I wearing, this was designed by the students. And we have our trainers, which you may have seen earlier on, there is about four or five women that was standing, they were our trainers. We had the graduation at old Parliament House and it was a very significant venue. We as a group of students turn around and said with all what we’re going through and what we continue to go through, you need to sit back have a look at we as a community, we know what our problems are, we know what our solutions are and the course needs to be appropriate. So it's got to be workable, it’s got be well informed, it's got to be culturally appropriate, we’ve already done that. And it was signed to the government all your laws and legislations that had been passed, as (inaudible ) generation is a prime example of that, we're coming back as healers within our community. Over 200 people came to witness this occasion from all over Australia. So where we have been and where we are going.

BETTY CONNELLY This is a picture of CEO of Relationships Australia, Mary Pekin. We had our course in Deakin in 2010 and we had 17 graduates. In 2011, we had two courses running, one in Deakin and one in Wagga and, as mentioned before, I think there is 14 in Deakin and 12 in Wagga. In 2012, we -- Mary's intensions is to have another course running in Wagga. So in New South Wales I arrived and jumped on board. I said, okay, we’d like to do something as well. And they had a course running in Bathurst. There has been a lot of expressions of interest for the delivery in Canberra again which we’re thinking about, Wagga we’re thinking that that will definitely go ahead, and then South Coast of New South Wales in 2012. So when we look at our graduates in the community, 12 months on...

00:24:55
"The diploma... having a certificate. Who knows what doors it will open" 

00:24:55
BETTY CONNELLY  So what we wanted to say is the seeds are planted, let's grow together. And this is a photo of us, which we're all quite proud of. And we said, up top, this is a statement that Mary made. In a time where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander counsellors are a precious commodity, it is hoped that this qualification has created further opportunities in both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and in mainstream organizations. The diploma, having a certificate, who knows what doors it will open. So that's our presentation.

00:25:50
BETTY CONNELLY I think we just got a couple of minutes, is there anyone that would -- has a question to ask? 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
 That's the exercise for the it’s on – okay, fantastic. Thank you, so much. Just in and if Alan and Mary and of course do a lot of work in cross-cultural stuff. I have been imbuing myself in a great deal, I know in my own practice I’m working a lot more with Indian culture which is common in my area and I have some -- been attending a lot of conferences in Hong Kong and India and think to try to pickup. And I just want to say the white man’s piece of paper, I get it too, because it actually is a kind of thing, we’ve been doing this for long time but you need that piece of paper and certainly for your own benefit in the community. But also this, I found there was stuff to learn. I’ve been doing it for long time. So I just want to ask the question of you, in all that time of the years of doing things to what degree, and what did you find, that doing that formalized piece, what holes did it fill or what holes didn't it fill, in the sense -- in that sort of making it worth it. 

00:27:10
BETTY CONNELLY  For us if anything it was the ownership, taking the ownership of the diploma we could screw up or we could turn around and make it better. So I believe that once we turn around and we took ownership of what the diploma look like, we never changed any of the structures, we just added to it and we felt quite comfortable that the diploma become a two-way of learning not only for us as students, but for our trainers and for other councilors that we’re working with. So it was the ownership, we took it back to the community and said, okay, this is what the framework is, this is what we need to add. We find that there -- there has been a big increase in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people accessing the service of the counseling and even when they-- we're for outreach. Yeah, well, it’s just, it’s quite a unique program. And what I'm saying is that this model can be a transportable model that could be taken anywhere but also work with different cultural groups. So if you want to have a look the sense of wellness is coming across since we’ve done the diploma because we’ve had, my niece may not want come to me, but we’ve got another councilor that she could turn around and go to, my son and daughter. And it's really difficult there because we -- because it's the structure within our culture but we give that opportunity. And I believe that would be something that could work quite successfully in other community odds I just need to get out there and say, okay, this is what we want and work on that. So for us the journey of healing started and it's just a continual process now and we want everyone to walk beside us, don't walk behind us and don't walk in front of us. You walk beside us and be our friend, okay. Thank you.
