THINKING ALLOWED With Jeffery Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFERY MISHLOVE , PhD. Hello and welcome. Our topic today is the cultivation and application of intuition, and my guest Dr. Helen Palmers, a professor of psychology at John F. Kennedy University and also well-known throughout the United States as an intuitive and psychic. Helen welcome to the program. 

00:00:45
HELEN PALMER Thank you. 

00:00:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It’s a pleasure to have you here. You know you achieved in an… an… an unusual kind of notoriety five years ago when Mother Jones magazine, sought of a… a social reform, left-wing oriented magazine did a cover story about you as a psychic and came up with the conclusion that in spite of their rationalistic bias that you were… you were doing things that they just couldn’t explain. How did that affect your life? 

00:01:15
HELEN PALMER , Ph.D. Center for the Investigation and Training of Intuition. Very little except that it was the most frightening thing I ever did. It didn’t change my life. My work is very much the same as it was then. I do sessions with people where I rely my intuition as a source of information and I teach both academic psychology and intuitive studies. And I don’t see any real war between those two points of view. But the… the article gave me a great deal of personal strength, because I realized it was a risky situation. 

00:01:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Putting yourselves in the hands of the cynical media. 

00:01:55
HELEN PALMER Well, exactly so and yet in… in… in some strange way, my attention came to the fore and it was actually a very exciting experience. I did a accession for one the then editors who was the writer of the article. Who was himself quite a… quite a scenic, I have to say, but I… I saw him as a fair-minded person, that if I gave some adequate demonstration that in fact he would report that accurately. So with that sense of security I went ahead with the article. Although, it could have been very bad for me if it had turned out that I was not able to give some evidence of intuition. 

00:02:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well, I can understand why they decided to do an article about you, at least in the sense of many, many years before that article came out, your repetition is perhaps the Bay area's most accurate and competent intuitive, psychic was… was well known to me and I think it's marvelous that since that time you’ve gone ahead and completed your doctoral degree in psychology. 

00:02:55
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:02:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And you're bridging both worlds in a sense, the rational and… and I suppose one might say the irrational side of. 

00:03:00
HELEN PALMER Well, the non-linear, the irrational, you know, which has the tinge of madness attached to it. And in fact, my own intuition I think was bored or… or I recognized it in looking… through sorting through my own neurosis, my own upsurgings of unconscious material in which there was a great deal of buried and unrecognized intuition. So, I understand when it is seen as an irrational function, but I don’t see it that way once it's become stabilized and you know it just isn’t an… an integrated function that everyone has access to. 

00:03:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You know I attended a brief workshop with you, well over 10 years ago, and you made it seem so simple. You… You handed each person an object sealed in an envelope then you said, "okay, here, describe the history of the object?" With no preparation, no… you just said do it. And there was something about the… the simple confidence that you expressed at that time. I remember I was very accurate. 

00:04:05
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:04:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And you’ve been working along those lines for a… for quite a while, now do you… and you helped to train people. 

00:04:10
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:04:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Is that your basic training approach? 

00:04:15
HELEN PALMER Well, I think we're not a… we're without guidance and teaching in this area. It's not that we're… we're reinventing the wheel. And when I teach I rely a great deal on traditional meditative practices. And I've made a study of those practices, what is similar about the various traditions, how attention is described and organized through different practices of focusing or emptying the mind. And so what I teach really are historical, traditional, focusing mental practices. And by following those, I think very ordinary people like you and I are able to tap into what seemed like at first extraordinary maligns(ph). And you know, in terms of the capacities of the human mind, intuition is not a big deal. It’s not a big deal state of mind, it’s a… it's a very available state of mind. If you have the confidence and the willingness to perform the practices to gain access to it. 

00:05:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Now, the exercise that we did together, classically cold… 

00:05:10
HELEN PALMER This is ten years ago Jeffrey I don’t remember the… 

00:05:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It was psychometric I think is the… 

00:05:10
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:05:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …is the term for it. I held an object in my hand and… and I just began to get mental impressions about the history… 

00:05:20
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:05:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …of that object, who had owned it? What kind of a person they were? Would you call that intuition? Is that what you… 

00:05:25
HELEN PALMER It’s a… a form of intuition. Psychism is the information about the material world… 

00:05:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:05:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …evidential material. It's an aspect of intuition and it's one that people are very interested in, because it gives an evidence and a kind of confidence to go forward into other realms of intuition. But the psychic aspect is a very flashy kind of arena. It's getting a great deal of notoriety now, because business has found a… a great interest in psychic affairs, because there is a great element of risk in business. Business intuition and decision making intuition of all kinds is becoming quite, how do you say, interesting to people. So the psychic world, I think is a very intriguing one, and it's one that I traveled into a lot. I… I like the study of what is possible in that world. But the realm of intuition has many, many aspects to it and the psychic world is may be the most easily available to people as they first begin to shift their attention into other states of consciousness. 

00:06:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Can we… Let's just sort of provide an overview of what some of the other aspects are of normal intuition, the kind of intuition that anybody could do… 

00:06:45
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:06:45
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …not necessarily a famous psychic? 

00:06:50
HELEN PALMER Yeah! Well, it depends on what object you focus your attention on and intuition is about something. You have an intuition about something. It’s not something that is very abstract. It’s usually functional. You have an intuition with respect to music or painting or an invention or a business deal or an intuition in relationship. Very commonly people experience a kind of precognition or a kind of empathy in relationship that they realize did not come from their thinking or the personality part of themselves. And so they become curious as to how to stabilize or get reentrance into that kind of experience. And so, people have a range of, you might say, entering experiences. The most common I think is the exchange of feelings with another person, which is a little different than the close approximation like a therapist who sees close approximation in the client of something that they have gone through in the past. And empathy is… is really the exchange of feelings so that you are as the other is to them self rather than a close match between what the other has described in your own close approximation. So, people, when they’ve entered that… that kind of unity, unifying experience with another person, say a family member, people commonly have an experience of unification with someone who has died, that’s not… not uncommonly reported. Precognitive dreams are really very much more common than I think most people realize. The… The availability being able to enter a dream state voluntarily and be able to… to know ahead of time an event as it will be played out, you know, they… they sound from the conceptual part of the self as very advance stabilities. And when you start training or working with your attention you go inside. They're actually very simple things. They are not so far out or so difficult to achieve. 

00:08:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You know, what you're reminding, what you're saying reminds me of… of an exercise I did, it was so simple and yet… and yet so propound it involved identifying not even with another person but with any object. 

00:09:00
HELEN PALMER Yes! Oh yes! The psychometry exercise. 

00:09:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE A little… A little different. In this… In this case, I like you to comment on it. I was asked to think of a problem I had, a major problem in my life and then to take an object, anything it could be a twig, a paper clip, a tooth pick and identify with that object, and then say what would that object, what would that paper clip or that twig? You have to tell me about my problem? And… And I found, and I was with a group of people that there was wisdom in… in any object you would choose. 

00:09:30
HELEN PALMER That assures in the object. The… What you… What you have is a… I could give a… a parallel example. In so-called primitive societies, which is certainly not very primitive along the lines of intuition, they're superior in that function, but very often there is a sense the rock told me. 

00:09:45
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:09:45
HELEN PALMER Or I gave… I got the message from the clouds in the sky, you know, and… and what it is, it's a specific focusing of internal intelligence, internal attention that focuses on the… on the problem and then the inner stream of reverie, the inner stream of impressions is played out on the object surface with your eyes open. 

00:10:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Very much like a crystal ball perhaps? 

00:10:05
HELEN PALMER Well, yes! There is a moving… the clouds in the sky are an excellent moving surface. The crystal would be a… a nice pointed focusing surface. And they… they lend themselves these external objects as devices you might say to focus the inner… inner mind in… in specific ways. So it's not really the trees or the rock or the clouds in the sky or the paper clip, but it’s the quality of attention that you bring to your problem and you use the external object as a device to focus your attention. 

00:10:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… It's different than identifying say with another human being? 

00:10:35
HELEN PALMER Not exactly! That… Well, different in the sense that the… the mode is different. When you focus on another human, very often the quality of connection is through the feeling state, the sensate state. When you see, when you view internally, even though your eyes may be open and the view is externalized, the… the… the capacity to pay attention is internal. But there are two… two ways that people commonly experience intuition. One is through inner reverie, vision and the other is through sensing. And often those that are inclined to have emphatic experiences, they're sensitive through their feelings and so the attention moves into the feeling state and so closely identifies with the other that there is a transfer of information in that way. My own proclivity is inner vision, so my inner sight is the strongest modality that I have. And so I was attracted to the historical trainings that teach grade aided, methodical steps toward inner… to developing inner visualization. And the task in visual intuition is to be able to immerse your attention completely in the object so that you lose yourself for the time in reverie, in the internal vision associated with the object. And this is how the information comes to you, through the contact of the inner vision. Empathy operates through the contact of inner sensing, but it depends on the capacities of the intuitive to be able to focus attention and that's what's common to all of these… these different kinds of experiences. 

00:12:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE I should imagine one of the… the real tricky things is that to take that intuitive insight, that inner vision and translate it into some form of useful behavior or activity in the world. 

00:12:20
HELEN PALMER Yeah! You know there are two… there are two liabilities in practice, in… in spiritual practice, if you’re applying it to intuition and trying to gather specific information, intuitive information. For some people, it’s hard to enter the state. The… The ego doesn’t want let go. It's… It's hard to get past the thought barrier. It's difficult to… to shift the attention into a nice, clean merge, state of mergence with a person or a situation that you're trying to tune into. And for others, they… they very easily slide into the state. They're… They're not blocked or inhibited in that way. But the recovery of information is the task and it’s a source of… of big problems in the psychic area, sometimes you get people with extremely accurate experience and then they project all over the place when it comes to the interpretation. So in a… in a sense it doesn’t have a… a kind of a touchstone in the real world. I think this is illustrated in the myth of Cassandra, who had great accuracy, but somehow was not believed, you see. And I think the metaphor in that is that the people have very accurate psychic experiences and then when it comes to metaphorically closing the gap between the dream or the empathy, empathic merger and making it useful in the world, having an accurate piece of information, that’s where the liability occurs. And therefore, I think, you know, gifted intuitives would work very well with people who have a particular interest like scientists or inventors, where the scientist or the inventor if they could lend themselves to the metaphoric imagery, the stream of internal clairvoyant imagery or inner empathy, could perform that function of bringing the translation through more accurately. 

00:14:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And with teams of people… 

00:14:10
HELEN PALMER Yeah! 

00:14:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …might work better than individuals, because it’s a lot for a person to have all of these skills in one person. 

00:14:15
HELEN PALMER Yes and a lot… a lot… I feel very, very gifted intuitives are not seen as such, because their… their language base is not very good. They're not able to bring the message through in a coherent framework, a conceptual framework and so it's dismissed, you see, and the person himself dismisses a large source of their own information. So, yes, I think, if the academics could move a little more into the metaphoric language of vision and sense and the intuitives could get a little off their biases of trying to make things evidentially, you know, as often intuitives don't like being pined into evidential material. That I think your concept of teams is very worthwhile one. 

00:15:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You mentioned earlier about the resurgence of interest in… from the business community, and the fact there are uncertainties in business. 

00:15:05
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:15:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And they need to resolve that. Do you think this is healthy for… for people in business to… to wanna move in this area of working with psychics and intuitives? 

00:15:15
HELEN PALMER Well, how do you mean healthy? 

00:15:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Is it… Well, I think a concern has been expressed by some people, you know, that business is essentially based on greed, on selfishness and that the… the psychic powers should be used for more spiritual things. 

00:15:30
HELEN PALMER You know it's a tremendously difficult issue. I wish I had the answer. And I… I recently I was at a conference of practicing intuitives that I felt were very gifted people. The… We met to exchange methodologies and what we really came up with was our concern about the ethics of the field. 

00:15:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:15:50
HELEN PALMER It's a tremendous area. I don't… I can only give you a… you know, a view, because in a way I'm split. I'm kind of on two sides of the fence. In one hand, to empower ordinary people with these abilities is a great desire of mine. Actually, non-intellectuals I think I have an edge in the possibility of accessing intuition. There aren’t so many biases and constraints to entering a non-linear state. So I don’t think, you know, academics and intellectuals really have a edge on this at all and they certainly didn’t invent mysticism. It was a very ordinary proletarian kind of activity.> 

00:16:35
[sil.] 

00:16:40
HELEN PALMER In one hand I want empower people and in an other hand you see the… the practices that are high-powered, actual scared technology methods, which are gradually leaking into the public domain. Over the last ten years we kind of had an influx of really impressive scared technology. 

00:16:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:16:55
HELEN PALMER Completely taken out of context. Completely, now taught and I as I'm where in one side of the fence I'm responsible for this some of these teaching. Being taught out of the context to be ego reduction, that was the part of the original basis of training. So you see these intuitive and psychic openings were seen as side effects of higher spiritual practice… 

00:17:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE That's right! 

00:17:25
HELEN PALMER …which were ego reducing, so if by… 

00:17:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And there were many warnings about don’t get caught up in the psychic level, you… you'll distract yourself from the… you know, the path to enlightenment. 

00:17:35
HELEN PALMER Yes, yeah! And on one side of the fence there are the… the practitioners of the… of scared tradition who are saying, don’t get near the psychic intuitive world and in the other hand, here we are in materialistic America where a major entra… entrance is in the lower case, in this… in the intuitive manifestations minus the upper case, the higher practices. 

00:17:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:17:55
HELEN PALMER So, both I… I have to say, you… you can’t stop the teachings, because we're… we're alerted now to where the… how… how to use the mind, what the functions are. There's no way of stopping the… the flood of teaching. 

00:18:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It seems that the ancients also though, the Shamans and the… and the tantric practitioners use psychic powers… 

00:18:15
HELEN PALMER Oh yes! 

00:18:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …for healing, for finding lost sheeps and dogs and goats. 

00:18:20
HELEN PALMER Yes! Lot… Dead bodies and lost children has never been my specialty I'm afraid, but… But, yes, it's always been used in a way to support ordinary life. But the question is still an open one, you know, who to train, under what conditions? 

00:18:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:18:35
HELEN PALMER And I think we're in a position Jeffery, where all we can do is shape it. I don’t think you can stop it, but you can shape it with a kind of a basis of… of ethical framework and a very interesting set of warnings, which I feel protect in some way the… the teachings from falling into too much disarray. My experience with people who developed a strong intuitive proclivities without some basis of ethicality is that the ego or the personality starts to backfire. And I've seen several outstanding examples of this where the… the personality became so glamorized on the other side of… of the coin the personality became so paranoid as a result of the opening experiences that they cease to exist, the personality just rejected them. That doesn't always happen, but there is that safeguard. The integration is the task I think, to integrate into the personality. 

00:19:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE I like that term integration, because it seems in a way that where at a point in history where the… the prime imperative for us is… is to integrate. We have a world that needs to get together and if we can bring to bear the higher powers… 

00:19:50
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:19:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …in the mind in… in making the world work better. 

00:19:55
HELEN PALMER Yes, yeah! I… I have something to say about that. I have one student who had, I think the most interesting application of intuitive training that… that I've ever heard. She's a black woman and she wants to use the intuitive practices as a way of helping her students. She is a clinician. Helping her students work with minority clients. She is using the… the sacred technology to help them work with projection, with unconscious projection. 

00:20:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Uh…Huh… 

00:20:20
HELEN PALMER And this of course is the basis of any good intuitive training to tell the difference, to discriminate between your projection, your false sense, false sympathy or false inner vision and the… the truthful impression that comes from the unknown situation. 

00:20:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE A projection in other words might be where I attribute certain? 

00:20:35
HELEN PALMER Falsely attribute. 

00:20:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Falsely, because they're really my own quality. 

00:20:40
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:20:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Some quality, may be I think you’re angry at me and I am really angry at you. 

00:20:45
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:20:45
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Uh…Huh… 

00:20:45
HELEN PALMER So, she is applying the… the scared technology of how to tell the difference between a projection and a truthful intuitive impression so that her… her students can work more easily with third world people. 

00:21:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It'll be nice if we could introduce that into the political arena… 

00:21:00
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:21:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …where we're so often pointing our fingers at… at other political factions. 

00:21:05
HELEN PALMER This it what I mean by shaping it. If… If… If this technology is solid, and I certainly believe it is, and it can be brought into the concept of an empathic merger with the so-called enemy or the… the… the correct internal view of the intensions of another, the… the thoughts may be traumatized, afraid of the other or aggressive toward the other. If a discrimination is the result of spiritual practice could be made, so that… so that I know the other as they are to them self and may be they are aggressively inclined toward me and may be they are not. But if I could trust that I had a truthful source of information, so that I didn’t have to rely on my projections or my information from the new service, then I think we… we'd be in a better position as how to understand each other. So, I'm optimistic in that sense of being able to shape the material in a useful way. 

00:22:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Do you ever work with businessmen for simple things like what’s the best time to sell a piece of property or what’s the stock market going to do next month, things of this sort? 

00:22:05
HELEN PALMER You know, what I teach them is the same body material that I teach to somebody who isn't… the least interested in intuition but want to open themselves through meditation. They get the same set of practices. My hope, and again my spirit is slightly divided on this, I have two opinions, but my hope is that the practices will work their magic. And so the… the business person, who may be vitally interested in the timing on the stock market, will when they enter the… the appropriate state of mind to become as vitally interested in something else, like an emphatic merger with the so-called enemy. So my hope is that the… the practices themselves work their magic. The… The individual uses of how people apply these practices is really up to them. But there I have to say that if the personality starts to get a little too on the glamorized side or little too on the paranoid side, it's simply, you cannot re-enter the state with any reliability. It's as if the ability closes down. 

00:23:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE What are some of the other applications that you’ve seen or worked with directly in… in your own practice or with your students? 

00:23:15
HELEN PALMER Well, the majority of my students are clinicians, so they… they want to develop their intuition with regard to their client's situation so that they can understand the other as they are to them self rather than simply a close approximation based on similar cases that they might have studied. So, the other large group of people are artists, who are very interested in stabilizing their attention in a state where the work appears before their thinking is directing. So, they're very interested in a specific shift of attention where they can apply their… their mind to, let's say it’s a graphic artist, toward a painting. So that they can stabilize their attention, so the painting is produced from a state of mind that is separated from the thinking itself. So, I would say artists of all kinds. 

00:24:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Now, when you say a produce from the state of mind is separate from their thinking self as if they were the instrument of some other higher intelligence. 

00:24:15
HELEN PALMER Why make it higher, why not make it ordinary human. 

00:24:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE I see! 

00:24:20
HELEN PALMER That… It’s higher in the sense that's different than… than the thinking itself. 

00:24:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Oh I see! Alright! Some other part of themselves… 

00:24:25
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:24:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE …that they normally, they block off in their normal intelligence. 

00:24:30
HELEN PALMER Yes, or… or move into spontaneously and then are more than anxious to get back there, you know, to re-stabilize their attention in an altered state. 

00:24:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Now, I wanna get back to this other term that you’ve mentioned a few times, 'emphatic contact with another human being to… to see a person as they experience'. 

00:24:45
HELEN PALMER To feel if it’s empathic. 

00:24:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Ah! To feel… to feel, to experience another person, the way they experience themselves. 

00:24:55
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:24:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And… And it seems so rare the… you know, the classic version is when two people meet they're really six people. 

00:25:00
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:25:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE There is who I think I am, who you think I am. 

00:25:05
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:25:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Who I think you are, rather than just you and me. 

00:25:10
HELEN PALMER Yes! 

00:25:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Uh…Huh… 

00:25:10
HELEN PALMER I think the most moving example of people who are moving in toward the… the idea of experiencing another truly are parents, who… who wish not to project their expectations and their false beliefs all over their children, but we're just a soon let the child be as they are to them self, to allow that freedom. And I find that a very worthwhile for the training of intuition in family situations. The… The sense of things is not a thinking state. It has nothing to do with one's thoughts. It’s a shift of attention into a state of merger where the experience is of the other transmitted through one's own sense of things, one's own feeling state. And, you know, it sounds so… so farfetched and so magical when… when it’s coming from the conceptual side. In terms of spiritual practice and the shift of attention, it’s not that far away. 

00:26:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It's as if it's apprehended not comprehended. 

00:26:20
HELEN PALMER Yes, yes, where the experience precedes direction from the thoughts. Now, a good example of that, let's take not the sensate but the visual experience, the voyant(ph) experience. In a dream you have all of the aspects of what is necessary to enter an altered state and the people dream all the time. At night, the attention goes away from the thinking state. Well, in meditation you can withdraw attention, you can detach attention from thoughts and focus attention on a relatively empty field of perception. That’s not a big deal in meditation, it’s relatively simple. 

00:26:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You can focus attention on the void? 

00:26:55
HELEN PALMER On a… On a relatively empty perceptual field. 

00:26:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Alright, yeah! 

00:27:00
HELEN PALMER So you can do voluntarily what happens at night in a rather automatic way. And then at night, after your attention has moved from the thoughts and has gone empty, no thinking, the dream happens spontaneously. And it is not directed by the thinking self, but there is a state of awareness. There is an observer, so to speak, and in the morning it’s recalled. The observer was awake enough to remember the dream and then when the attention shifts back to the thoughts, then the dream is recovered and submitted for analysis, so to speak. 

00:27:30
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Uh…Huh… Helen, we're going to have to stop now. We're out of time. 

00:27:35
HELEN PALMER  

00:27:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE But it has been such a pleasure having you with me. Thank you very much. 

00:27:35
