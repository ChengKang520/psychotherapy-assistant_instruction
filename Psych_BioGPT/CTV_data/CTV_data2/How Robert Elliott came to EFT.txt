How Robert Elliot came to EFT 

00:00:15
ROBERT ELLIOT I am Robert Elliot and I am going to talk about uh… my self and how I came to the EFT umm… I was trained as clinical psychologist in United States uh… where I worked almost for almost 30 years and during that time umm… in my training before that umm… I learnt many different approaches to therapy uh… I was trained originally by a student called Rodgers in "Person centred therapy" and then I had umm… training in "family systemic therapy" and "psychodynamic therapy" and "behavior therapy" for they, for they were such a thing is "cognitive behavior therapy" and umm… about 1985 I was working in, I was in some (inaudible ) botanical in UK. And umm… I was doing a presentation on my research and umm… I present some data an old analyst challenge me umm… by making a psychodynamic interpretation of some of my clients data. My client was reporting on a "dream interpretation" and experiences of this dream interpretation and the analysts came up with some psychodynamic interpretation of this, this dream that declared to had and I said " what we don't do that you know research we don't into we, we take the clients" what the clients say to us the face value and the analyst said "well, uh… umm… you don't do that in your practice is there you are interpreting your client's dream, right? So why not interpret their and I said "what that mean? I was, I was scandalized by that and and I said no which just do that" he said "why aren't you being inconsistent?" I said " yes, I am being inconsistent and umm… I thought about that I won't back to United States and, and said you know my the my useful psychodynamic interpretation is not consist in my practice. By this time I tried "behavior therapy" didn't work for me and my clients. Umm… and Laura Rice, analyst, Screenbird were warning to begin the work on to developing "integrated human humanistic therapy" that pull together personal (inaudible ) can stop therapy maybe was an existential things and umm… I said you know umm… I want to focus on my person centered experiential groups as a therapists. I want to give up psycho dynamically interpreting my clients and was like kind of integrate myself better. Uh… because I have been working as a "collective therapist" and umm… so we greet to work together. We started developing this therapy umm… I said to Laura Rice umm… I'm I'm attached to my interpretations because uh… growing up in family I was considered to be clever and my parents loved it when I came up with clever interpretations with things. So I am very attached to interpreting my clients and I wanna stop doing then, Laura said to me uh… I'll never forget this she said. I'll tell you what I do? You mean she was trained by (inaudible ) Rodgers and so it was you know I'll tell you what I do? When I want to interpret my client uh… I say to my self no matter how clever interpretation is what your client is going to come up with uh… through the therapy process figuring out fir themselves is always going to be different and better in whatever you got. And umm… and you know what? That's true and I said you know that, that actually fits my experience of when I interview my client. If it works at best uh… it's not the thing I came up with the solutions whatever the client did with? What I came up with? So, I let go out my urge to interpret umm… and uh… we began developing this therapy uh… I was the test subject basically my team of the university (inaudible ) Toledo Ohio we doing a research studies is the first study on EFT uh… we started in 1985 we're doing the study of dip… of depression. So we developing this therapy this integrated humanistic experience of "therapy for depression" umm… and uh… my students and I would see this depress clients and I take my recordings up to Toronto and I … get supervision from learning lesson we use that to develop the therapy umm… now the therapy fits my… fits who I am very well umm… not interpretation, not the not interpretation part but the uh… because it emphasis getting deeper inside the client's experience but also being quite active and adventurous and curious umm… so these qualities for me are part of my back ground umm… my family the sort of our adventurous nature or curiosity umm… the effect that we like to sort of active engage in things we're not pass observers and so all this came together for me and really made EFT really good fit for me uh… and so uh… over a period of about five or seven years working with Laura endless umm… uh… we together developed the, the model that became an emotion for this therapy.
