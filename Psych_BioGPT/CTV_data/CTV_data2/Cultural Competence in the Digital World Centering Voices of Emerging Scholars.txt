MARIE MIVILLE So I'm so pleased to welcome uh… you to our conversation this morning with scholars who the newer to the field than some of us already collectively have been making a big impact on scholarship as well as the next generation. This morning session is gonna be lead by Dr. Thomas Parham, a long time support of the Roundtable. I believe Thomas was here at the first Roundtable 33 years ago. Just a few words about Thomas. He is a Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs as well as an adjunct faculty member at the University of California, Irvine. Prior to these positions, he served as an Assistant Vice Chancellor for Counseling and Health Services, the Counseling Center Director and the Director of the Career and Life Planning Center at also at UCI. Dr. Parham grew up in Southern California, received his bachelor's at Irvine and his doctorate in Counseling Psychology at Southern Illinois, University of Carbondale. His advisor was the same as mine, Janet Helms, so he is a brother in many ways for me. For the past 30 plus years, Dr. Parham has focused his research efforts in the areas of psychological nigrescence and he's authored 6 books and over 40 general articles or book chapters in the areas of Identity Development, African Psychology and Multicultural Counseling. He's also produced several videos including counseling African-Americans, youth and violence and innovative approaches to counseling African descent people. Dr. Parham has received numerous awards and honors for his academic contributions and community service including the 20th Helms Mentoring Award. So what is amazing about Thomas? Is not just all he's done in the traditional academic way, books, scholarship, awards, articles and so on, but the powerful and positive influence he's had and continues to have on others. Thomas cares about what happens in his communities including here. And I still recall the very first year, I was the Roundtable director, Thomas just called me up out of the blue and said, "Marie, let me know if there is anything you like me to do." Here we are, eight years later, Thomas is still assisting the Roundtable and so in such impactful ways. Last year actually Thomas was here with his own mentor Jo White on this very morning this auditorium. And they spoke an inspiring and healing ways about the recent tragic events involving Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and some so many others. I have to say this was one of the most amazing sessions I've ever, ever had the privilege to attend. In advance to that, Jo and Thomas wrote on behalf of the Roundtable and all our communities, the following call for a new narrative for black life. I just wanna briefly share a little bit of that because it helps calls up that energy and urgent sense of advocacy we still need to head. The justice we seek will not come as society's gatekeepers only hear from those who are most depressed rather justice will only come when the masses of people in unified coalitions across demographic boundaries rise up and demand that change must happen now, but we are hopeful. We are hopeful because we have seen change in our life time. Dr. King was clear that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. And so this morning, we actually welcome new scholars that are helping continue that advocacy in very important and critical ways. There are group of scholars that have already been so impactful to the field as evidence by their scholarship and awards, but more importantly, inspiring yet another generation of mental health professionals and social justice advocates. Several of our panelists are already familiar to us here. As they are long time supporters of the Roundtable who like myself began in their student days. So I'd like to start with Dr. Doris Chang, who is an Associate Professor. And if you can just hold your hand up just. Yeah. So folks know. Associate Professor of Psychology at the New School for Social Research and a Research Scientist at the Center of Excellence for Cultural Competence and also the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Her research addresses disparities in the quality of mental health services for racial and ethnic minorities in three distinct ways. Describing the role of race, ethnicity and culture in mental health and service delivery, identifying strategies for improving treatment processes and outcomes involving racially, culturally, linguistically, discordant provider patient diets and developing empirically and culturally-grounded therapeutic interventions. She is currently the Principle Investigator of International Collaboration to develop and apply, Dallas Cognitive Therapy to Chinese American immigrants with generalized anxiety disorder. In 2015, Dr. Chang was awarded the New School Award for outstanding achievements in diversity and social justice teaching. I came to know Doris personally through our association with a really, really cool leadership program that I recommend to all of you when it's actually for more mid career, early mid career folks. And this actually offered through the APA, the Leadership Institute for Women and Psychology. It's a really, really great program. Dr. Milo Dodson seated next Thomas earned his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and completed undergraduate studies at the University of Notre Dame. He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at UCI Irvine Counseling Center. And Dr. Dodson is a committed advocate for service-based leadership, and serves as Camp Director for Common's Dreamers and Believers Summer Youth Camp. He also provides consultation services for the MVP Group Program, an innovative talent development consultancy. Dr. Dodson was recently hired by his former choir, the internationally acclaimed Pueri Cantores San Gabriel Valley as the Director of Team Building to help co-lead the choir on his pilgrimage-tour to Italy. That sounds fun. 

00:06:55
MILO L. DODSON It was. 

00:06:55
MARIE MIVILLE Dr. Dodson is currently working on creating/hosting a television show to holistically discuss wellness, metal health and social justice. Dr. Dodson also is a student of Jo and Thomas, so comes from this great lineage of psychologist in the field. And actually, he was here last year and posted this really just wonderful snapshot video on Facebook of the presentation that Jo and Thomas did. I felt that was really nice. Jioni Lewis… Dr. Jioni Lewis received her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Her research is focused on the impacts of subtle forms of racism on the mental and physical health of people of color with a specific focus on women of color. She recently developed a self-report instrument to measure Black women's experiences with the intersection, intersections of subtle forms of racism and sexism or otherwise gendered racial microaggressions which I have to say is a concept and scale that my research team really, really loves. We're enjoying learning that (inaudible ) And all that great stuff. She serves as the media and PR coordinator for Division 17 of APA and she also serves on the editorial boards of The Counseling Psychologist and the Psychology of Women Quarterly. Dr. Lewis was recently awarded the 2015 Carolyn Payton Early Career Professional Award from Division 35 of the American Psychological Association for her published work addressing the concerns of Black women and girls, and Carolyn Payton is one of the most amazing founders of psychology particularly as it relates to women of color. So that's quite an amazing award. Dr. Silvia Mazzula is Psychologist, Professor, Mental Health Researcher, Author, and I'm proud to say TC Alumm… yes. As I sat with Dr. Mazzula yesterday, I can say I knew Dr. Mazzula when she was a great student. She is the Executive Director of this amazing online group, the Latina Researchers Network. And if you don't know about it, Google it. It's really a fabulous network, especially for women of color and has its own conferences that happening soon, I think. 

00:09:15
SILVIA L. MAZZULA San Antonio, July 14th. 

00:09:20
MARIE MIVILLE Okay. So look that up. Latina Researchers Network. And assist… And she's also an Assistant Professor of Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY and the Former President of the Latina Psychological Association in New Jersey. Dr. Mazzula has extensive research in counseling experience with underserved communities. She's a speaker, consultant and trainer on issues of diversity, inclusion and leadership development. You also may have seen her on a Steve Harvey episode on racial issues which I thought was pretty cool. And she also twitters quite, quite often. Tweets, she tweets. At least, I didn't say twit, but that okay… She tweets often on her Twitter, okay. Okay. Dr. Mathew Miller is an Associate Professor and the Co-director of the training of the council… He is the Co-director of training of the Counseling Psychology Program in the Department of Counseling, Higher Ed, and Special Ed at the University of Maryland. My own Alma matar. He is a scholar, much in demand as you can see by his multiple editorial board appointments including the Journal of Counseling Psychology, Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, Asian American Journal of Psychology, Journal of Career Assessment and Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling Development. I don't know when you have time to sleep, but that's pretty amazing. He also… 

00:10:45
MATTHEW J. MILLER (inaudible ). 

00:10:50
MARIE MIVILLE There we go. That's the best time. That's the best time. He also has a super active research lab. It's called Culture, Race and Health. And it also looks at three distinct tracks of research. Basic culture and race-related processes, the role of cultural and racial factors in health and health disparities and the measurement and assessment of cultural and racial constructs. And in line, with our conference theme, one of Dr. Miller's research priorities is to develop interventions that increase historically underserved populations access to culturally appropriate evidence based strategies for coping with racism and the preparation and then ecologically valid video format which sounds really interesting. Dr. David Rivera is an Associate Professor of Counselor Education of Queens College CUNY. And like Silvia, he too is a TC Alum. So I'm also pleased to say, I knew him when he was a fiery full of verve graduate student. 

00:11:55
DAVID P. RIVERA I'm not fiery anymore. 

00:11:55
MARIE MIVILLE Yeah. So age does that to us. And he received his doctorate… See, my own age. Comment. He received his doctorate right here in Counseling Psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University. He also holds degree in Psychology and Counseling from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Wyoming. David's research focuses on cultural competency development and issues impacting the marginalization and wellbeing of people of color and oppressed sexual orientation and gender identity groups, with a focus on microaggressions. He has published journal articles and book chapters in various areas of multicultural psychology. He is also currently board co-chair of CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies, on the executive committee of the APA's Society of Psychological study, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues. That also Division 44. He is a consulting editor of the journal Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity, and an adviser to The Steve Fund. His practical work includes consultations and trainings on a variety of cultural competency issues. And he also helps of co-found the first ever LGBTQ, uh… LGBTQ scholars of color conference that was founded right here in New York City last, year and I was so honored and privileged to attend and speak out. So that is really an amazing accomplishment. So as you can see, this is really quite an amazing group. And so I'm gonna turn it over to Thomas. Uh… 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Let me say good morning. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Good morning. 

00:13:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM I said good morning to rest of you. Good morning. 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN Good morning. 

00:13:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM I want you to always recognize how special the place this Roundtable is. And for those of us who labor in the field of cultural sterility in lots of places around the country. Yes? And whining about how right anti-cultural, some other places we occupy are yes. This is one of the say spacious you can come to every to make sure that you can just give yield up would all of the Roundtable has to offer. So I wanna make sure that we never take that space on this space for granted. Umm… before we get into our panel, uh… I wanna engage in the first of a couple of rituals here. Umm… It is always important for us to make sure that we give thanks and credit. Dr. Miville mentioned I am the Alum of the first Roundtable Uh… when I was a Young Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And Sam Johnson called up and said, "You know, how about come in up to present that role to train up from Philadelphia to be here uh… in 1983, some 33 years ago and have been a participant in the Roundtable. Even in US, when I am not presenting I make the track just because it's one of those special spaces to be in. And so the Roundtable has really been blessed by exceptional leadership uh… from Sam to Robert and Robert to Mc. Donald, from Mc. Donald now to Marie. And as many of you may have heard or some of you may not have heard, Marie has announced that she would be stepping down as coordinator of the Roundtable after this year. And we cannot go on any further without saying thank you to her. So, Marie, I'm gonna invite you to come back up here. Come on. 

00:15:40
[sil.] 

00:15:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM And I want to invite some of your students up. So Mariel and Veronica, why don't you all come on up? And you don't get to stand behind the podium. You get to come out here. Okay, see the big long introduction she gave us all and then she just says, hi, I'm Marie and then goes and sit down like. No, no, no, no. So we're gonna stand right here in front. Go for it. 

00:16:10
MARIEL BUQUE Okay. So, Dr. Miville, we actually couldn't let leave without giving you a parting gift… 

00:16:15
MARIE L MIVILLE No. 

00:16:15
MARIEL BUQUE For all that you've done for the Roundtable in the last eight years. You've really left us, really marked with all of the things that have transpire throughout these years, especially all the coordinators that have worked with you. And your role as Director and so, we wanted to umm… honor you with the citation. And so all of us, coordinators, from the eight years that you've been here in the Roundtable have compiled something that we like to read to you, okay? Okay. So Veronica is gonna read it. 

00:16:50
VERONICA JOHNSON Dr. Marie L. Miville, during your eight years in the role of director of the Winter Roundtable, you have impacted so many of the individuals that have been a part of this conference. Leaving a mark that is forever ingrained on our hearts. Working with you in this capacity has been an incredible journey. Each step has been insight for rewarding beyond what I would have anticipated. In this role of experience, some of the most memorable experiences I've had in my years at TC. And I'm eternally grateful for the experience that you helped to create. I admire your commitment to honoring leaders in the areas of cultural competence in diversity and continuing to connect researchers, clinicians and educators under our collective goal of serving the underserved and underrepresentative. It is our pleasure to present you with this award for your support and enthusiasm for the Winter Roundtable and its place in the history of, of creating a space for sharing ideas for those in education and psychology who value, who value cultural competence in social justice. When I worked as a coordinator for the Winter Roundtable, it was the first year for you, my fellow co-coordinator and myself running the program. Despite the learning curve, you were kind with your forgiveness and generous with your support. We very much felt like a team learning how to swim together. Everyday we work together. You remained kind, supportive and confident. And as a supervisor, you lend those straights to your supervisees as well. Reflecting back on those late hours in the office, I realize that we laughed just as much as we sigh, shared stories of our own lives and identities as we saw them reflected in other's scholarship. And we're always encouraged to celebrate even the smallest of victories. Your gracious demeanor is truly unmatched. I enjoyed every minute of working with you, such a well-spirited person such as yourself. You provide a view with the template of what it means to be cool, calm and collected. And I hope that I'm able to response similarly in my future endeavors. 

00:18:35
MARIEL BUQUE Serving as the Winter Roundtable coordinator as a doctor-student was instrumental in my professional development as a psychologist in training. Your trust, guidance and leadership fostered in me a passion for multicultural psychology, a deep respect for the elders in the field and the hope that I could be a part of this great work in the near future. As your student, supervisee, advisee and mentee, I can attest to the immense impact you've had during the course of my doctoral pursuits. Dr. Miville, I'm so grateful to have been a part of this experience under your leadership, not only has the conference left an imprint in my professional identity, but also your guidance and mentorship throughout my time as a coordinator has pronounced within me a lasting impression one that I hold to pass on to future generations of mentees. Thank you for your selfless devotion to the Winter Roundtable and everyone who has in anyway been a part of this meaningful event. You're strengthened and network of social justice warriors, I aspire to continue in your footsteps and honor your legacy. #Thank you. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:20:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Give it up. Marie Miville! 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN Whoo-woo! 

00:20:20
[sil.] 

00:20:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE Thank you so much, all. It's hard to have words for this. I'm so deeply moved. And it's been such a joy to work with the coordinators, the volunteers, the assistant coordinators, everybody. And this will live in my memory forever. And I just have to say I'm so happy to see the Roundtable continue and to see all your faces here and look forward to seeing you here next year. Thank you so much. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Then I just feel good, yeah. Yeah. That's why you come to the Roundtable. Now we can get started. Uh… what I'd like to do as we began and I'm gonna invite each of our panelists, so I'll try to keep the answers short. We get a lot of ground, we wanna cover on a lot of things, we want our audience to bear witness to. As I like to start with just maybe 30 seconds of opening comments. Well, Dr. Miville was kind enough to do was to read bios, to talk about all those things that we do, but I'm reminded that there is a difference fundamental between what you do as a professional and who you are as a person. So I want us to open up like talking about who you are. So, Dr. Mazzula, I'm gonna start with you on that. And come on down this way. Who are you? Who do you want the audience to know you are? 

00:22:05
SILVIA L. MAZZULA I am a first generation immigrant. First in my family to graduate from high school and college and the doctoral level education. I am mostly importantly a mother and my two little ones are there. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
SILVIA L. MAZZULA And I am… I wanted to be a relatable face. I attended my first conference, it was the Winter Roundtable, I was a first year doctorate student and I attended my first session where I saw a female Professor Latina talk and I waited online to say hi to her and all I could do was cry. And that image jested with me and inspires me. It gives me images of success and that's what I wanna have for my little ones Um… because of my background. So that's who I am. 

00:22:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Good. Dr. Rivera? 

00:23:00
DAVID P. RIVERA So I'm also a first generation college student uh… from a low income background, a rulish (inaudible ) community in Wyoming. And to relate it kind of took the topic of who I am. I'm one of St. Berry community and family-oriented. And family, I use that term not loosely, but I define it widely. Not just to me and my family have origin that I share blood in lineage with, but the community of scholars that had become friends, that I've built along my, my lifetime so far and a thinking about technology and how that's really kept that together for me. , You know, I… My family of origin is 1,500 miles away. And if it weren't for technology, I wouldn't feel as connected to them as I do umm… right now. And so I… That's kind of what I, what people to think about me when they think of David Rivera, you know, I like that connections with the service and the research that I do, but I also wanna be a thought of us somebody whose, whose mission and drive us to really foster community in interpersonal connections. That's applied what I value the most in life. 

00:24:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM All right. Dr. Lewis, who are you? 

00:24:15
JIONI A. LEWIS Umm… so umm… similarly to David and Silvia, I'm also a first generation college student. And so and I'm from California, from San Jose, California from the Bay Area, but I think apart of who I am is somebody who at a young age, race was very salient to me growing up in a place like San Jose, that's diverse, but there are very few Black folks that you see around. And so for me, a kind of my race and gender being a Black woman is something that's really aspects of my identity that are very salient to me and really wanting to umm… giving the fact that I am a first generation college student Really, it's important to me to give back to others umm… and I received excellent mentoring from Helen Neville and so graduate student and so for me, being a mentor is a really important role for me and trying to give back and mentor the next generation of psychologist. So that's what I would say. 

00:25:20
MATTHEW J. MILLER I am… I am a middle aged man who used to think. I had it all figured out. I remember going to graduate school, my first semester thinking that I'll, I'll knock this out real quick, get a great job right away and then, you know, become the best in my area. And over the course of several years, really wrestling with what I thought was important publishing, excellent researching, great journals, umm… advancing science. And in the last few years of my life, struggling with meaning about to having an impact about doing work that matters, not to a bunch of academics, but to people in the real world. So that's, that's my struggle and that's kind of I am wrestling and negotiating in the academic environment where really all I wanna do is work that is meaningful so that in 10, 15 years, you know, I can be proud of what I've done. I'm also a father and soon to be father again, so that is on my mind as I'm sitting up here and my partner is taking care of sick child and another child and waiting to introduce another child. So that is who I am. 

00:26:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Chang? 

00:26:35
DORIS F. CHANG Let's say I'm also… I kinda hated hearing you say middle age 'cause I'm also middle age. I am a Chinese American. I'm actually a US born to immigrant parents from a very white part of Texas. And that is very much shapes my identity and identification is someone who has worked really hard to kind of fit in where I am. And so a big part of my journey has really been umm… trying to stand, trying to make myself stand out more umm… which I think now that we have power and influence in our roles as academics, as leaders in our communities, we have an obligation to do that more and more. So I'm also proud to be a student of Stanley Sue, Nolan Zane, David Takeuchi, so many amazing mentors that have really helped, helped me and shape my professional identity. Umm… and I'm also in an intercultural marriage, so I have (inaudible ) acted around along with umm… being a mother of two boys. And so I do identify very much with my gender identity and the challenges of, of balancing work and, and family and other, other parts of life. And so yeah, I think that's it now. 

00:27:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. Dr. Dodson? 

00:28:00
MILO L. DODSON All right. So similarly, I am also a first generation college student. And I think I also wanna be able to add that I'm a proud product of a Public School System out in California as well as a proud product of a single parent household, umm… being biracial and growing up in Southern California, being raised by my Italian-American mother was particularly difficult at times I think for both of us. Umm… and I think I'm, I'm really excited to be able to share that at this point that she was the kind of the first person that taught me what it meant to Black and to be unapologetically Black. And as a white American woman, that was I think, like I said, really, really difficult for at times. And in addition to that, I'm also… Oh, I don't know. I feel like now that I'm going last and we both have some profound answer or something. Umm… 

00:28:50
DORIS F. CHANG Sing us a song. 

00:28:50
MILO L. DODSON Sing us a song? No, no, no, no, no. That's another day, man. Umm… I think I do wanna be able to share that I'm somewhat of a walking contradiction to be able to say that I am, you know, unyielding ambition, but then also low to self-esteem at times. Umm… on the core on the other side of the pillow, uh… you know, I'm also I think… Yeah, let that sitting for a little bit there. Umm… and lastly, I think and what happens when you really begin to believe in who you are and just become who you already are. That's all. 

00:29:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm, I heard somebody saying mm-hmm. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM So in preparing for this panel, Dr. Miville and I uh… had an opportunity to kind of layout some kind of themes and several of the panelists had a chance to ask us like, do we wanna prepare, do we wanna whatever. And the answer was no. Because what we don't want our necessary descriptive prepared answers. What you have is a collection here, some very talented people, but this is really the new generation of folk and we want you to see how well these folks can just wax and vain even spontaneously in some other spaces that where we would go today. And that's really the value of what there is. So now they're all kind of go and, oh God, where we gonna go? So let's see how they do. So I wanna begin by reminding us about one of my heroes and there comes Dr. King. And Dr. King reminds us that our lives began to end the day we become silent about the things that matter. What matters to you in your life? Start with Dr. Dodson. We'll go back to him. What matters? 

00:30:50
MILO L. DODSON Make me start with the, the hard ones here. Umm… I think what matters to me… Well, first Black lads matter. Let me be first and foremost about that in the, the context and the environment that we're living in at the moment. Umm… I also think that being as my bio say, but really just from the heart being a committed service-based leader and being able to get through my, uh… my days of being a less in confident and, and kind of doubting myself to be able to understand that it's okay to be great because everyone can serve and there is, there is greatness in service. Umm… so service is what matters to me. I think, family also matters to me. And as David was sharing, being able to define and expand your family greater than just your, your lineage, greater than just your, your blood lineage. Umm… I also think as we were talking yesterday during your (inaudible ), Dr. Parham, that it's really, really important for me to love and to be loved in return. Umm… that adage kinda came to me at the end of a really, really unhealthy relationship when I was actually here that like, we broke up like two days before I came here, you know, I'm not gonna put my business out there and (inaudible ), but umm… 

00:32:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM I know what sound there already. 

00:32:10
MILO L. DODSON Yeah, so… It's all right. But I'm not gonna go into more detail then. But umm… So basically, the adage for me came out of understanding that as much as I was trying to put into the relationship, I wasn't getting as much back. And I kept trying to love, but I wasn't necessarily being loved in return. So love, being loved and loving umm… is what matters to me and I'll kinda, I'll wrap up with that. 

00:32:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM All right. Good. Dr. Chang, what matters to you? 

00:32:40
DORIS F. CHANG It's already so deep and it's like, 10:30 in the morning on this Saturday. Umm… 

00:32:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Oh, we just knock on top of those, so we ain't even got bottom of those and deep yet. Keep on going. 

00:32:50
DORIS F. CHANG Umm… I would say to do good. Just simply to do good. And as part of that too alleviate suffering when I see it. So I'm also a clinician and, and I, and, and it's incredibly rewarding to, to help, help people find their way out of suffering. Umm… and to, and to learn to be effective in the role because I think we can always, we can often umm… aspire to make a difference and then beat our, so beat our heads again to wall trying to do in a particular way and are often flexible enough to see the, the path we need to take. So (inaudible ). 

00:33:31
THOMAS A. PARHAM Good. And, (inaudible ), what matters? 

00:33:35
MATTHEW J. MILLER Personally I think… Again, there has been a real shift in my own life and my heart if you will, umm… you know, impact factors don't matter to me as much anymore. Recognition, it's more about, am I doing something with my life that is alleviating something that that will leave behind. When I think about my children, am I going to modeled for them healthy relationships, healthy racial identity, coping with races in a way that's not gonna get myself or them arrested. Umm… professionally, I think about equity and I think about uh… some other work that my students are doing that are providing a culturally appropriate language services and languages that are not English. And that to see for the first time, for example, Cree and Elders who are sharing stories of, of cultural distress and racism, and maybe for the first time in the public forum and seeing them connect with that uh… at a effective level and seeing the freedom in that. And I look at that and I say that matters, that matters much more than my paragraph about how can we work with this population's matter, but doing, doing the work matters. 

00:34:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah, that's real. Dr. Lewis, what matters? 

00:34:55
JIONI A. LEWIS Umm… for me, social justice and not just the idea of it, but actually social action and actually being on the ground, I'm doing the work. Umm… and sometimes that mean standing up for umm… you know, having the integrity to stand up for things when you see injustice is happening in whatever space you're in, whether that's at work, at school, umm… in your personal relationships. And so, for me, it's important to have integrity and not compromise that for, you know, umm… in academy or another spaces. And so that something that it, that matters to me a lot and really trying to do things like, like Matt said, doing things that actually matter in those communities and making an impact. Umm… and, and really trying to not just, you know, do research to kind of explore, you know, racism, sexism, homophobia et cetera, but to try to do something about it and impact change. 

00:35:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Good. Dr. Rivera, what matters? 

00:35:55
DAVID P. RIVERA Coffee. Yeah. I'm not a really good person without it. People that are close to me can attest to that, but umm… on the serious note umm… the hurt, the aggressed, the voiceless and the invisible, I think those are all themes that keep me going. And when I see anybody who doesn't think that they have a voice, like, I think we all have one, but we are socialized to believe in many circumstances that we don't and that renders us invisible. And my mentor Derald Wing Sue always would say, you know, our job is to make the invisible visible. All right? Bring light to those circumstances. Not necessarily that we are going to speak for the voice, for the voiceless. I think that's very problematic. But we're gonna help to have people actualize their potential. Everybody has their potential to use their voice, but they've been taught that they can't. And so umm… that matters to me. Helping people to, to fulfill their potential and so they can use their voice and be heard. 

00:37:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Wonderful. Dr. Mazzula, what matter to you? 

00:37:15
SILVIA L. MAZZULA So I wanna piggyback on what you said. Not the coffee part. Although the coffee part just… umm… What matters is helping people see their potential. Umm… And see being the key word. Umm… I experienced a lot of racism, discrimination, sexism because of culture being non-native, English speaker, raised by a single mother, uh… lots of dysfunction in the family. And for a very long time, I did things because someone told me I couldn't do it. I went to college because my guidance councilor said, "You shouldn't go to college because you might get reject that if you apply something that even gonna give you application. So I actually stole the application when she was away. So I went to college because someone told me I couldn't go to college. I feel like my whole life until the day I graduated from Columbia University, it was doing things because someone had told me I couldn't do it. And then piggyback and the self-esteem part, umm… I was walking down with my doctoral-hood uh… as a graduate with a Ph.D. from Columbia University. And in my mind, what I was thinking is "What do I do next? What is the next degree?" And I was planning to go to law school. And took my butt to therapy… and realize that I was looking for external validation to belong to the places that were uncharted. So what matters to me now is helping others whether it's my kids, my friends, my students, see their potential and creating images that are not there, I didn't have images of success. No one in my family went to college. I didn't. You know, I saw a TV that's the extent of my professional world. Umm… so that's what's important for me. 

00:39:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM That's good. One of the pieces that remind us all about uh… Dr. Mazzula talks about the need for that validation. How many of you can identify with that search for external validation, right? From even some very unhealthy sources at some time, right? Audience, what about you? Yes? So fundamentally, remember this. One of the best lessons Joe White had ever taught us. He said, "You cannot seek validation and should not seek validation from the oppressor. 

00:39:40
DORIS F. CHANG Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. Somebody said, "Mm-hmm." 

00:39:40
DORIS F. CHANG Mm-hmm. 

00:39:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM You should not and cannot seek validation from your oppressor, right? Now, as we talk about our lives begin to end, the day we become silent about the things that matter, we also invite you to think yourselves as you write the notes in your margins about what matters to you. All right? Now let me flip the question. Because being in these positions of influence now, your all professors and clinicians and doctors and you ranked probably in the top two or three percent of awful educationally in the nation and yet, who heard from our panelists some of the doubt, some of the, right? Unsure. Some of the, I don't know, still trying to find my strive, my confidence. Isn't that interesting? Even as we try to get into these particular spaces. So what I wanna know is we flip the question because the Dr. King had a dual-sided coin there. If our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter, what have you been silent about that you wish you hadn't have been? Let me start in the middle. Dr. Miller is like, "Oh, Lord." 

00:41:00
MATTHEW J. MILLER At least we could have a couple minutes now. 

00:41:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM This one I know is not even tough because everybody knows that this one is right there in your heart. Search your heart. What have you been silent about that you wish you hadn't have been? 

00:41:10
MATTHEW J. MILLER I actually have a song prepared. Oops. 

00:41:15
MILO L. DODSON You wanna harmonize or… 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
MATTHEW J. MILLER Umm… you know, I, I think for me, the, the painful reality has been that over, you know, decades owning my own male privilege and not speaking up about oppression of woman. The way that that is silently operating in the back of my mind and when I'm not actively trying to tear that down and I see that I… It's too easy for me to be in a system where I'm not saying anything or speaking up or where I am myself perpetuating this, this oppressive system. 

00:42:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Lewis, what have you been silent about that you wish you hadn't? 

00:42:05
JIONI A. LEWIS So, so that's a difficult question a little bit because I feel like I'm so negotiating not right now. So being junior faculty member, umm… I think that there are times that I'm not silent with certain circles, right? So you find your allies and so I feel like, there are certain people that umm… that I'm able to keep it real with and tell them and, and, and I think I'm trying to… umm… I, I taught… I highlight issues of, of racism and discrimination in umm… in my department and my college at the university and umm… I'm, I'm right now in the midst of experiencing what that, umm… the backlash of what that is about, so we do standup and say something. Umm… but I do think there are times when I'm silent in spaces where I don't feel like, I'll necessarily be protected against that backlash. And so I think, but like I said, I think I'm still trying to negotiate umm… how to standup for, for these issues that matter to me umm… as a junior faculty member, as somebody who doesn't have tenure umm… particularly I given the climate right now, the political climate, the racial climate, it's umm… difficult to, to rain, to rain, to navigate. 

00:43:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. Dr. Chang? What have you been silent about you wish you hadn't? 

00:43:25
DORIS F. CHANG I really identified with what you're talking about. It doesn't… It maybe gets a tiny bit easier, but it's not that easy even now for me umm… in terms of knowing what to do when you're in spaces and there are things happening umm… in classrooms and faculty meetings and your apartments that you know are, are problematic and maintaining systems of oppression that affect you and affect other people of color umm… and then knowing how to, how to effectively deal with those issues. It's very, very difficult to do. Umm… and again, I think I'm, I'm working on, on that as well. I think one of the internal barriers for me is actually my cultural socialization as a Chinese-American woman in a predominantly white community. And I think the coping strategy that worked really well then which we always bring until today was umm… to just kind of smile and try not to make waves and then kind of do a lot of stuff behind the scenes, right? And so that's, that worked really well for my family. Umm… it worked for me for a long time. It's still a strategy that I use. And yet, it doesn't actually challenge the people that are in power and it didn't hold them accountable umm… to be trying to compensating for and, and working behind the scenes to make things happen um… in spite of the system. So umm… I think learning to, learning to use your voice and taking risks… you, you challenged us a lot yesterday about thinking carefully about what we're willing to sacrifice umm… and support, surrounding ourselves with, with support and allies to help us when we, we get the backlash to be able to, to be strong. 

00:45:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. Dr. Rivera, what do you think? What have you been silent about you wish you hadn't? 

00:45:25
DAVID P. RIVERA And this is one that I've, think I've always had a conscious understanding, but subconsciously it's affected me in many impactful ways, but it has to do with umm… social class issues. And as I mentioned I grew up in a low income background and that something that I probably wouldn't say out loud until probably the last five years or so in a public setting, but that's something I feel like I need to say because I've been silent about it so long. Umm… and it has to do with the internalized oppression that I felt around umm… social class issues growing up literally on the wrong side of the tracks. I think that analogy is very true. And for me, it was literal context that I grew up in that I was definitely shameful about and it took a while for me to… I'm still releasing that shame umm… of, of the injustice that I experienced umm… being labeled as somebody on the other side of the tracks growing up, but also as Dr. Parham said umm… that we shouldn't strive to umm… kind of meet the standards of the oppressed, oppressor, right? And that's kind of what I'd been doing for so long as wanting to blend in on the outside and even with the way that I spoke umm… with the oppressor to create the elusion of someone who umm… was not from a lower or socioeconomic background. So that's something I've been, I have been silenced about and I'm still working through and probably will for the rest of my life that I hope to use my voice now to share my experience, but hopefully, help others to share their experiences so that we can lose a lot of that shame that keeps us silent. 

00:47:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Dodson, what have you been silent about that you wish you hadn't? 

00:47:20
MILO L. DODSON I think growing up in Southern California and being socialized as young Black boy and, and growing up into a young Black man, there was a lot of silence, there was a lot of time where I remained silent about anti-gay comments or comments that were against the LGBTQ community. And, you know, in elementary school, in middle school, everything was that so gay, when people were trying to express something being unique or weird and not being able to standup to that. Umm… you know, more recently, with Sister Caitlyn Jenner being able to umm… speak up a little bit more, but still feeling that much more uncomfortable umm… and recognizing that there's still more room, there's still more growth that I need to do in that area. Particularly, as I'm expressing myself in the Black community, but then also in different circles within the entertainment industry that I've been fortunate enough to interact with, trying to really speak up and, and say, you know, just like we're talking about the struggles against Black folk like, "You can't, you can't say that, man." Like that's not, that's not respectful at the very least. Umm… so now really like I said, wanting to identify those opportunities and really speak up against that. 

00:48:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Mazzula, what have you been silent about that you wish you hadn't? 

00:48:40
SILVIA L. MAZZULA That is such a tough question. Umm… I mean, I can relate to what everybody says here and I keep thinking the imposter syndrome, it's like all over. I feel like I've done so much work on myself, but there's always so much umm… white, my whiteness has been something that I struggled with for a long time acknowledging my whiteness as a, is better for me to just say, identify with my multiple oppress groups umm… it's just easier to do that uh… acknowledging my whiteness and talking about it, acknowledging my heterosexism is something that I recently started doing more uh… verbally with my students. Umm… I like to just introduce myself in class in terms of my privilege identities. And I'm very blunt to say these are my blind spots. So if you catch me saying something, raise your hand and tell me. But just the imposter syndrome, I mean, when I got the invitation to come and talk, Dr. Miville emailed me and before I responded to you, I reached out to my colleague, Kevin Nadal. We were co-host here at Columbia. And I said, "I got this invitation to go to the Winter Roundtable. I'm gonna be like nine months pregnant, I'm not doing it. Who wants to hear a pregnant woman?" Umm… talk about the imposter syndrome. You know, I've accolades galore, you know, I can give you all the awards that I have. And here I was thinking, "I'm already pregnant, who wants to see me," you know. So there's a lot for me to keep working on and, and talking about. And when I mention brining images for to help people see their potential, one of the things that I'm interested is pipeline development. One of the biggest issues right now is lack of women in, in academia, lack of women in research careers. And so I like to use myself as an example. So here I am, nine and half months pregnant. I just got tenured uh… and promoted and I did that while pregnant. So it's possible, but I'm still working on it. The imposter syndrome is very, very alive for me. 

00:50:55
DAVID P. RIVERA That's real. We also remind ourselves that while all the things we do, I think, are important. There is no greater blessing in life I think than being trusted with the growth and development of our children, particularly those that are able to give birth to them. So we thank you for being here. 

00:51:10
SILVIA L. MAZZULA Thank you. 

00:51:15
DAVID P. RIVERA All right, and orienting the new generational folk, right? 

00:51:15
SILVIA L. MAZZULA That's right. 

00:51:20
DAVID P. RIVERA Social justice movements today affect not only youth but the larger society. And yet, some of the places and spaces that each of you occupy, sometime, keep you separated from, in some cases even divorced from, some of those social movements. How do you engage those social movements, whether it's, as you said 'black lives matter,' whether it's 'Latina lives matter,' women's lives matter, all lives matter, whatever it is. How do you engage such social movements and still maintain your sense of space and agency in the places you occupy? Let me start with, Dr. Lewis. 

00:52:10
JIONI A. LEWIS That's a good question. Umm… 

00:52:15
[sil.] 

00:52:20
JIONI A. LEWIS And what? And, and maintain the spaces and places, how do we engage with that and then…? 

00:52:25
DAVID P. RIVERA Yeah. 

00:52:25
JIONI A. LEWIS Okay. 

00:52:30
DAVID P. RIVERA Because it's hard to not be moved by the social justice movements that exist, except for people on the ground. You know, they almost have umm… a syndrome we call like the (inaudible ) syndrome like, "I ain't got none to lose." So they're out there just doing it. But the more you have to lose, the more pause and hesitation that we sometimes engage in about whether on not we're there, that's what Dr. Chang was talking about a minute ago in a question I posed yesterday. The question is not doing know what to do, the question is, what do you prepare to sacrifice? And so even as you get into this powerful positions, those are questions that can continue to haunt, right? The cycle is there. So you think about engaging in this social movements, how do you do that in the spaces that you occupy now as a faculty member? 

00:53:25
JIONI A. LEWIS So I think, you know, as I was saying earlier with the kind of maintaining a sense of integrity. So for me, umm… it's important to engage, right. So going to the 'black lives matter' rallies, going to meetings in, you know, my local community. Umm… It's important for me to be doing some of that work on the ground umm… despite knowing that there's, may be risk associated it, associated with it. I remember, I went to 'black lives matter' rally that we had in, in Knoxville and I remember then, I teach a social justice practicum course. And I remember a student, few of the students later said something to me about, you know, it's really great to see you there, specially since you're a junior faculty member, the fact that you were there. I didn't, and I was like, "Oh!" I didn't even think twice about being there and thinking about that. And so for me, umm… you know, I think it's important to, to do the work and umm… and not always worry, I guess, about potential ramifications of doing that work, umm… because it was really important and powerful for the students to see that I was there and doing that umm… andI hadn't thought about that. So I think they're… I think now being at this place realizing kind of the power and influence I have to be in those spaces, be involved in the community in those ways and how… You know, people notice that. So people in the community notice that when I'm actually engaged in that way. My students are noticing that when they see me out doing that work. That's important to me. Umm… And then I think, you know, thinking about, kind of, my different spheres of influence, I think it's important umm… to bring that stuff into the classroom and have those conversations within the courses that I teach, umm… to do things on campus to support student organizations that are trying to do some of that work. So, umm… so, yeah, I think, you know, and, and, and knowing that you can't, umm… you can't do everything at anytime. So it's about uh… working within your sphere of influence that you have, umm… you know, so in my roles as researcher, teacher, umm… you know, service, and outreach to my university community. And really trying to engage like I said, beyond kind of the Ivory tower. Those are the things I try to do. 

00:55:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, Dr. Chang, what about you? 

00:55:45
DORIS F. CHANG Umm… I, I was thinking umm… first about my duty as a person, a citizen. Umm… I took my two kids to a 'black lives matter' rally here in New York. And, you know, as, as mixed race Asian white kids, I knew that I could kind of get away with not talking to them about it. And at the same time, I knew that so many of their friends were having the talk with their families already, so many of their black and brown friends. And it felt like, you know, as far as… it felt like I, I had a moral duty to begin talking to my own kids because of their own privilege and knowing that they're gonna have a very different kind of experience encountering umm… the police in the city than, than their friends will. And so it was a really, really hard conversation as far as what I was prepared to sacrifice. I felt like was, you know, these like, this five year old, this like seven old year and being like, "Dudes, it is… The world is ugly. There are people that are really upset about this thing that happened." And, and, and it was really important. So we went to the rally and, and we made posters. And I felt like that was really important way to participate sort of as a citizen. And then, and then I think it helped me umm… sort of try to expand my reach to. So now, so then I started doing talks at their schools, about talking, talking to children frankly about race and doing in a developmentally appropriate way because there was a lot of, kind of, hiding I think. Especially among the, the white families about like, maybe we cannot have to talk about this yet. You know, we don't want to upset our children or they're too young to really understand what's going on. You know, we're living in New York City, and there's protest all around us. It's affecting so much of community. So I think umm… that's one way I try to engage this as a person. And then, in a mother, but then in the classroom as well like, trying to make a lot of content that we teach about in terms of racism and discrimination and the research, but then also making, making an immediate experience in bringing in news articles, videos. And we talked a lot about the protests happening all over, the student protests happening in the campus, umm… and trying to help them apply the concepts that we're, we're studying empirically and teaching about truth something happening right now and helping them to think about how to use what we've learned in our work, to guide their own actions, you know, in the world. So I guess it's our two ways. 

00:58:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Good. Dr. Mazzula, what about you? 

00:58:25
SILVIA L. MAZZULA I also do a lot of, as a, as a mom talking to my little guys about race. Umm… Specially they're, they're privileged, they're Latinos but they're white. So we talk a lot about issues of race at home. In the class, I mean, in, in, in my space, at the institution where I am, umm… a lot of this happen while I was in a, in a 10 year track position. So it's very challenging for a young faculty to raise their voice because there's consequences and some real consequences, uh… for your career if you plan to stay in academia. So what I did was I actually had a lot more conversations in the classrooms with students. And it may sound very simple that we talk about these things with our students, but the reality is that, these conversations do not happen. I mean, department of 56 faculty, and there was just, I think, two of us or three of us out of the 56 that brought up issues of Fergusson in our classrooms to hear what are students were dealing with. And it became a big conversation during our faculty meeting, on whether that was appropriate use of classroom, discussion in classroom time. So it may sound like something very simple, but it's not something that happens often. But that's one way that I've been able to kind of validate my students' struggle and experience in some of these movements. 

01:00:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Dodson, we're talking about engaging social justice movements. So, how do you do that in the spaces you occupy? 

01:00:10
MILO L. DODSON One of the biggest things for me in the last year and some change, has been understanding that social justice will outlive, well I live my lifetime. And that the process and the struggle, especially when it's, like really real, it never really ends. So being able to accept that no matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter how much work I do or I, I do with colleagues, that there's always something more to do. And being able to find a sense of peace and acceptance in that because, you know, after, after Fergusson, you know, and everyone was hash tagging Fergusson, and then there was a moment of, of like, really profound sadness when you recognize that hashtag Fergusson is really hashtag everywhere. And being able to understand and accept that, like I said, that the process and that struggle is going to continue on. Umm… And I think for me, uh… you know, two other big things is really understanding. First question I would ask myself. One, who am I and why am I doing what I'm doing? Umm… Like I said, there's two questions. So, one, who am I, and then two, what's the purpose? Why am I going to engage? What am I trying to achieve? Who am I trying to serve? And not just walking into a space umm… thinking that I have all the answers, being able to really walk in to a space and listen before I even say anything, to really seek to understand before I'm trying to be understood. Umm… And I think for me, as, as Matt was talking about being able to really own and embrace and understand male privilege, umm… trying to advocate for women. You know, I do more listening than I try to speak particularly, 'cause I'm not gonna go in and try to say, "This is what I think needs to be done and let's do that, da-da-da-da-da." Just like on the flipside, you know, I know what non-black allies coming in, trying to tell me what it means to be black or how am I supposed to uh… engage in that movement. So kind of a combination of all those things, umm… you know, accepting some social justice, being able to understand who I am, umm… and doing more listening than speaking. 

01:02:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. Dr. Rivera. 

01:02:30
DAVID P. RIVERA I have a lot of thoughts on this one. Umm… First, I think I need to uh… have a conceptualization that there is an inevitable symbiotic relationship between what goes on, on the street, which includes literally on the street but also in the social media and in the, on the internet. In the internet, on the internet! And what goes on in the ivory tower that hopefully we're helping to make less ivory. But there's a symbiotic relationship there. And it's all too often ignored on both sides, right, but mostly in this ivory tower. And I, as a scholar, practitioner, uh… social justice advocate ignore that relationship, then I'm not gonna do my research good, I'm not going to be an affective and competent instructor. I can be an affective clinician, right? My work is not going to match the needs of society. So I have to start with that premise that there's a symbiotic relationship between those two. And if I have that going on and I, that's kind of that perspective I take, I almost felt like I'm sacrificing anything if I bring that in to my work. Umm… I do… I say that but I also have trepidation when I do take those chances. And I'm experimental if you will with my teaching techniques or the type of research project I want to do, and I worry about Tenure. I still have a couple of years for Tenure. Recently transitions institutions for that purpose. So I knew at my other institution, it wasn't as valued as much, right. But I wasn't willing to sacrifice umm… my ability to bring in the really important life and death when we really think about it, social issues into my work as an academic. And umm… part of me in doing that was, well, if what I'm doing is so controversial for this institution that they're gonna use it against me, then I accept their decision not to give me tenure and I'll move on, right. So thankfully I found a place now in a home. I truly believe it's a home that values what I do. And so I'm able to take the risk but I still get, you know, have some fears. I showed Beyoncé's formation video in my group counseling theories class. Well, I think while it is formation have to do with the group counseling theories. Like it has a lot to do with group counseling theories and it has a lot to do with being prepared as a clinician to uh… validate the experiences that our clients have in their daily life. That, that's come in, that material is gonna come into of, my students are not prepared to effectively and forthrightly address these issues with their clients, then they're not gonna be affective with them. So we had an amazing discussion for about an hour. I had to like change my, my topic for the day. But I think it taught them more than umm… the, the concept of liking, I would have, I would have taught them for that day. So I think that, I think we have to start with that premise. We also have to make ourselves available to taking in and learning, and increasing our knowledge about what's going on, on the outside. So if we like it or not, we have to be connected in some way to the media, right, 'cause unlike 15, 20 years ago, umm… the impact's gonna be felt immediately. Right, and if we're just connected from that, we're not gonna be able to incorporate that into our, our work as scholars and practitioners. 

01:06:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM All right. So we've got a lot more ground to cover. Little bit of a long question. But I want to make sure, I haven't forgotten. Umm… I want to make sure that we have umm… as much perspective as possible. So as we uh… move on and, and engage this audience with where we're going, I want to make sure that we just kind of prep us with the next phase which is going into use of this cultural confidence in the digital world and how we do that, okay? So, Dr. Miller, let's go to you on the last question. 

01:06:55
MATTHEW J. MILLER It's, now finally I tenured faculty member with administrative role. I find that my prior umm… assistant professor mode which I would describe to people before us like weasel mode, which was, what am I willing to give up, because I have children, you know, I have to pay rent, I have to pay for things and survive. Uh… But there were things that I would not be willing to be silent about it. It's, what I found now is that I'm less likely to engage in weasel mode but it's, I found that thinking about social justice and acuity and movements in, in the community. And having conversations with colleagues who are senior, who will vote on me coming from associative fall and having relationships with people, but still having clear disagreements. And trying to explain why, for example, not al Asians are doing perfectly fine or why we need to think about, rethink kind of admission criteria or recruitment ideas. And it's, it's, it's a very tricky balance uh… to politely educate. But also at some point, this is into suggestion but we have, we must do this. And so umm… you know, there's a privilege I think for those of us who have been in the training programs recently and that this is now on the radar. And so there's also, you know, a sense of, you know, if, if I had been trained 30 years ago, what I really have been so enlightened to be ahead of where… so, you know, trying to have to recognize that it's difficult. But it's, you know, how I engage the integration of the movements for acuity in the community and with the movements out there that a lot of young people are doing with my role novice means, I have many more difficult tricky conversations with colleagues who do not believe the same thing I do and yet still realizing that I can't change their mind, so what can I do? And it really is a sense of compromising what can actually happen, which is, which is a very tricky balance. And if any of you out there know how to do it, please let me know and then I will pay you like five bucks or something, so. 

01:09:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hold out for 10. So as we think about this cultural confidence in a, in a digital world, let's, let's circle back around to that, because when we talk about the use of, of technology and online interventions, I wonder whether or not it allows us to connect in authentic ways with the people that we care most about, our students, our clients etcetera. Does it allow you to connect in authentic ways? And for you what are the pros versus the cons on that? Dr. Dodson, we'll start with you and go down. 

01:10:00
MILO L. DODSON I think the first step is being able to understand that social media is its own form of communication. So when you walk into a certain environment, when you walk into a certain conversation, you recognize the, the limitations and you recognize the boundaries. So for example, if I'm sending, I'm sending Matt a text message, I don't necessarily expect that he's going to send me a response immediately right after that. Just like if I'm gonna ask him a question right now and he waits like 15 minutes and I'm be like, "All right, man, are you okay? Like, you want to give me, you want me give $20 instead of that five or…" So I think understanding the limitations and in boundaries is really important. Umm… In terms of the authenticity of the, the interactions on the social media I think, it really depends on, on what you're, what you're looking for. So I would, I often do try to, you know, stay connected to friends from under grad, from grad school, either on Facebook or Instagram or whatever and that feels real. But for me that, that authentic interaction is based off of our face to face interactions that we already established. So I'm not going to necessarily try to start a, really deep conversation or really deep interaction or relationship with somebody online for the first time. Umm… So I guess that's the, one of the pros for me, you can reach anybody uh… throughout the world, almost instantaneously. But the con is understanding like, if I have on expectation, and Matt or anybody else has another, then that's not going to feel as, as authentic, that interaction is not gonna vibe as well. The last thing I'd say, is I think one of the pros for social media. I mean, you see like black Twitter run stuff and by stuff you know what I mean. So being able to understand that this space provides a previous voice list with something so real and something so pervasive that they are allowed to engage people and, and allow to make like an infinite amount of hash tags to really express their beliefs and to be heard in a really real way, that way. So I guess that's some authenticity as well. 

01:12:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Chang? 

01:12:15
DORIS F. CHANG Umm… I think that some of the pros are that it can producing contact with people and their… sort of the causes and perspectives that are… that go and represent it in mainstream media. So as far as learning about the experiences of others umm… and the impact of certain policies on their lives is incredibly helpful. It, it's connecting us to others experiences outside of our, sort of immediate series. And I think this is important in world where, I think the study was 97% of white people, only interact with white people. There is a poll, a recent poll, may be, may be it wasn't quite as high, that was in the 90s. You know, that, so we are not actually encountering people who have different life experiences than us. And we carried our lives to protect us in a way from having to be confronted with difference. And so social media can be really helpful uh… when in your Facebook feed you're like, something pops up and you're like, "I would have never come up on that article,' you know, otherwise. So that can be really useful as far as broadening our consciousness. I'm also been kind of, interested in this mode of participation umm… in social activism which has been all… sort of derisively referred to slative, slacktivism, right? I think like, "Oh, that change.org, petitions coming, I'm just gonna sign that" and I'm like, "Done my good job for the day." Umm… And so there has been some criticism about, "these sort of armchair activists," who just, who feel like they are doing something by signing those petitions and you know, tweeting and forwarding, you know, certain news items. But, you know, there is some evidence, at least in some of those cases that it can bring about remarkable change. So I think one of… It was actually a change.org petition that contributed to the removal of the confederate flag from the Courthouse in South Carolina. So funny things like that, if, if it's combined with sort of personal engagements, in, you know, person to person conversation, I think it is a root into greater social participation in activism than, than it might be accessible to many. Umm… In terms of the pros, so, uh… we are invited to just to tell personal stories. So I, I, I started a blog, a couple of years ago in the… I'd though started. I wrote two posts and the whole point was, I was like I'm gonna participate in this conversation and go outside of, you know, academic circles and… So I was approached actually by someone at Psychology Today saying, you know, "Would you, would you do a blog on race in psychology?" And it was very cool invitation and I called it 'The Elephant in the Room' and it was gonna be, you know, designed to really translate umm… research findings about race and psychotherapy relationships to people who might, you know, benefit from that. And I, and I really kind of slack myself up to do this. And I started writing and I realized just how hard it was to do it. And part, and there were so many internal barriers around, you know, who am I to write something about this and then also being feeling really constrained with the academic conventions of like, I felt like I couldn't say anything without ten caviars and ten citations and… Do we really know that? Can I say that? Can I make that recommendation? And I think I got into my, I got it my own way because I didn't have the proper training and now I think there are… You can be, you can get training and how to write for popular audiences, for how to write Op-eds, which can reach huge audiences but that's not where we've invested our energy as academics. And so, I think to do it well requires developing that skill and it is something that we should be teaching our students. It's something as faculty that we should be, you know, taking uh… the initiative to learn umm… and hopefully this, this conference will inspire me to, to write my third post and… Once a year. Yeah, I will. 

01:16:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM So I'm hearing some love coming for you from the audience, right? Yes. All right. Dr. Miller. 

01:16:35
MATTHEW J. MILLER Umm… This is interesting of the… in, in my midlife, mid-career kind of crises I have turned to. If you saw me yesterday, I was the guy walking around with the ridiculously large camera. Umm… In, in part of my research on racism and cultural adjustment, I've realized I can write a really savvy. What I think is a savvy argument for why as researchers we need to be very nuanced and how we talk about acculturation and its impact on mental health and may be my mother reads it and may be that doesn't really make a difference in the real world. And so I really come to believe that we need to be better at communicating our knowledge to help people. So we, you know, when we look around the room… You know, I'm first of all, I'm just, you know, I'm watching you by the way. I was… I've been taking a lot of pictures and living and, you know, having this fan experience. But… it is, I mean… I mean, I got to tell you, if you're sitting up here right now, I'm nervous and I'm excited and it's… I don't know what I'm saying. Umm… But you know, I think authentic experiences and connections can happen. So for example, if you're on Vimeo, there are, you know, thousands of short videos about people telling stories and they are deep and some are really creepy but they're really… You know, so I do believe we can have authentic connection and I think people's stories move people. And I think if we can frame the knowledge we have about helping people overcome racism, how to help people, how people can kind of uh… work with kind of, cultural stressors, that hearing a story of someone who looks and has the background, how they were able to kind of, manage a situation. I think that's really affective way that we can think about alternative ways of, of helping people cope. I mean, you know, we're, we're trained in models, let's say 15 minute individual sessions. You focus on what they wanna do and I just, I feel like the generations emerging now, that's not ecologically valued for them. They are on their phone, they, they are listening to I… or they are listening to things… Sorry. I almost sounded cool but… And, and I think that's what we can do. So I certainly, we miss things, we miss the non verbal's, we miss the, the connectedness it happens one to one. But I think we can connect in other ways and it's for us to kind of expand our way of thinking about what is connection look like. You know, the other thing is it increases access. So, you know, for, for us in the Maryland area, we, we try to find Korean language fluent therapist who could see some of the people we were doing research with. There was somebody may be 35 miles away who charged, you know, $150 an hour for Korean elders who don't have transportation and don't have money. And so for us, it's, if we can get them some kind of media content in their language, that is culturally meaningful for them, that, that to me is worth losing the connection that can happen one to one. So I think for me, I'm really excited about the way in which we can utilize media to kind of bridge the gap and, and get the idea of acuity and access. 

01:19:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So that trade off becomes worth it in that content? 

01:19:55
MATTHEW J. MILLER I think in that regard, you know, we can't wait for thousands of Korean or fill in the blank, language fluent culturally confident therapist because we know, this is my favorite conference. I, I can't afford to come here often but, but because of the minds… When you look around the room it's inspiring but you know, if we fill a stadium with people who are mental health professionals, we would be a very small minority. So we cannot wait for everybody to get onboard or to learn the language. So for me I'm very, very much committed to this idea of, of using media to advance acuity. 

01:20:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM So we're talking about digital online interventions and the degree to which it allows us to maintain those authentic connections with the client and students and other folk. Dr. Lewis? 

01:20:45
JIONI A. LEWIS Yeah. So, so one thing I kind of initially thought about was in my role, teaching. David mentioned it that the formation, Beyonce formation video. So I also did the same thing right after, you know, video and after her uh… super role performance umm… and actually if people were at Kevin Adolf(ph) talk yesterday, he mentioned that he put something on Facebook like, "how are people gonna use this in the class room, right?" And I saw that and I was like, "Yeah, I'm gonna do that," because I had, I had been thinking about it as well. But then seeing that in other, you know, some of us were commenting. And so, so yeah, using those things that are actually going on in the classroom. So I showed it in my Africa-American psychology forum and we talked about it and students were able… Okay. And students were able to highlight, you know, intersections of race, gender, umm… culture, black southern culture. I mean, all kinds of stuff. I was impressed with my students' analysis, you know, critical analysis of, of the video. Umm… And, and there might been a few students in the class that may be umm… were little surprised and may be it wasn't there thing. But generally for me, I thought, it was important to bring in these things that are happening umm… and particularly as it relates to pop culture and things that students really care about and are connected to. And when you could make those connections with the course content and these things are really actually going on the world. I think that provides a more authentic classroom experience often and it allows students to really kind of get it in a different way then they would otherwise. And so, and then I went into my grad social justice prac class and, and in that class, a student brought it up and said, "Can we watch the Beyonce videos?" I was like, "Oh, I wasn't thinking about showing in this class," but and it, and it just really worked. And so umm… so I think that, that something that I feel like is important to me and my teaching style, you know, umm… using kind of, social justice, feminists, pedagogy and really trying to connect the content and having egalitarian space in the classroom, umm… doing that work in that way. Umm… And then also and thinking about, you know, just this kind of social justice activism, you know, a little bit of what you're saying, endorse about, armchair activist or that kind of thing. So I was recently had umm… uh… There's this black issues conference that our university puts on and they brought, Sandra Bland sister was the key note. And she umm… she was really, really powerful. And one thing she really mentioned was just how much social media had an impact on peoples' awareness about this, what happened with her sister. You know, she's like, within two days, you know, it was a top trending on twitter and Facebook and all of that and that's what brought it into the national media attention and put a spotlight on that injustice. And so, you know, all those people, you know, some people kind of think that you can't use, you know, engage in activism through social media. I think that there are a lot's ways that you can and there are a lot's of umm… ways that you can make an impact and actually umm… do things. And I think that's what's happened with a lot of these social justice movements in black lives matter and all of that. I mean, right, black twitter, you know, has a lot of power and I think that that's important for people to, to, to realize, to realize the, the power of that and actually addressing some of these social umm… justice issues. 

01:24:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, Dr. Rivera? 

01:24:05
DAVID P. RIVERA I'm someone who has just about, almost reach that point where half of my life was lived without email and half of my life is now in… I wish everyone could see my phone. Umm… I have 98,96,981 unread messages in my inbox. And that makes a lot of people have a panic attack, not to make panic, make light on panic attacks. But one of my friends up here, Shalsas(ph) has a lot in her inbox, but I have more than her. Umm… But I'm one of those people who have lived my life half of it umm… without any even knowledge or experience or competency with the internet or social media and then almost half of it umm… were I immersed in it and I can't really see myself or conceptualize myself without it. And it's taken a while though to, to become comfortable umm… using it in the various aspects of my professional life. But personally, I know that it's been extremely impact full on me in terms of social connectedness and rather the lack of it that I experienced umm… growing up for about half of little, again, half of my life as a closeted gay man in rural Wyoming, where there weren't any mirrors of, positive mirrors I should say of umm… what it was to be gay. And how my first coming out experience was to somebody I didn't even know through an online chat room and how important that was for me. And so I kind of hold that experience close to me when I think about the importance of social media and the internet and technology as means of, of interpersonal connectedness that might be countered to the definition that probably nearly all of us first learned of what the most meaningful connections were, right, that's to face to face. We needed to sit in a therapy room face to face and this hour which really isn't an hour, probably 45 minutes a week is going to be the most impact full thing on your therapeutic growth, right? For anybody to believe that, that's a fallacy. You know, we do have an impact but there is a lot that happens outside of the room and lot of intervention umm… that takes place outside the room that involve social media. Umm… When I was on my internship at the counseling center, University of Pennsylvania, I had a client who was chronically, who had chronic suicidal ideations. And during particular point in our, our therapeutic relationship, she was in a heightened uh… had a heightened level of distress going on and her suicidal ideations were becoming, were manifesting, right, until there might have been a reality of a suicide attempt. And so we decided that for her a lot of it was lack of connectedness as well that was going on her life. So we were working on that and trying to increase that, but I also had a genuine concern for her life. And so we decided that we were going to check in daily via texting. And at the time I was like, "Oh, can I even recommend this?" I thought my supervisor was gonna shoot me down, but my supervisor supported it and we checked in daily. We had a contingency plan for, if she did not respond to my… if I didn't, if I didn't hear from her by the certain time, who I would contact. Umm… But a year later when I was still working there but not directly with her, she came up to me and hugged me and told me how, how impact full that intervention was on her life. And I know that many therapists now a days including one of my friends in the front row do kind of break the boundaries. That's what we have to do. We have to break the boundaries. Not just push them, we have to break them to encourage more innovative use of the technology for the work that we do. And so that's something I continued to do. I'm not always comfortable doing it but I need to kind of work against that discomfort, understand what that discomfort is about. Sometimes it has to do with, with, with age and not being completely comfortable with that, someone puts boundaries. And not all uses of, of the media for, for a therapeutic intervention or for research are going to be ethical. So we need to have this conversations and, and still work on developing competent ethics and cultural competency as well, also knowing that not one intervention fits all cultural uh… world views. 

01:28:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Mazzula? 

01:28:40
SILVIA L. MAZZULA Umm… Umm… I think authenticity is relative to the platforms that we use. So authenticity looks different, whether you're talking about Twitter, you're talking about a private Facebook group uh… or Linkedin. I think… I just had a random thought, it has nothing to do with this. But I keep saying I think and that is such a woman thing to do. So females, when you're gonna say something, don't say I think. Okay. So let me start again. Authenticity is umm… relative to the platforms that we use. So I manage a few platforms. I use Twitter mostly to increase access to information, particularly for underrepresented scholars. Umm…. And so, whether you would call or re-tweet or repost in authentic relationship, that's relative to the platform that we're using. Uh… But I know behind the twitter, I may run into someone that I've never met before umm… and they will say you to apply to a research funding opportunity because of the information that was provided. And it has created uh… authentic relationships that would not have happened otherwise. Umm… In areas like Facebook and you have private Facebook groups, there can be potential for more authentic meaningful discourse if it's a safe environment. Umm… I'm speaking as an educator, so there are some ethical issues that if you're talking about clinical work, but I think… But there are a lot of benefits uh… to using social media. And I got to piggyback on your comment about age because umm…. I was a college student when emails first came to be. So we've done a lot of learning ourselves. We weren't raised in social media world, but we definitely need more training for our students, our clinicians, all of us in terms of how to translate our research or our clinical work into social media friendly platforms. I did one blog uh… for the APA Public Interest Directorate on microaggressions. And it was cost something like how does racism, or Latinos experience racism too or you speak so well, Latinos experience racism too and it was very kind of sure two paragraph blog, umm… no citations, no references, it was kind of one of those things like, "Oh, don't I need to have like a big reference list and this sounds, which is like regular, it doesn't sound scholarly at all." And I think that, that blog has gotten more attention than any article that I have ever done, that any presentation I've ever done because just it reaches a large body of people that would otherwise not read our material. And to be honest, who reads our material? Other researchers, are pry doing a literature of you for their own research. I mean, that's the extent of, right? So social media is very powerful but the downside of social media… And when we're talking social activism and talking about issues of racism, I just finished running a social media campaign for the month on racism and tweeting about how racism hurts, hashtag racism hurts. And umm… one of the things that could happen and we have to be ready for is, the response that you get from people when you start tweeting uh… about things that are sensitive, right? So we have to be prepared to be able to respond in a way that is also sensitive and enlightening and moves the conversation forward if someone then turns around and calls you a racist or reverse discrimination person or anything that may down your activism in the purpose of, of your post. So that's something that we have to be trained to kind of navigate. 

01:32:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. So as we begin to move into our last few minutes of point values are tripled now, okay? So we're gonna try to move through this. So in my generation of folks, there were obviously lots of challenges that we had to confront. What's the one challenge that your generation is facing in the field right now as a new scholar that might be different than what we faced, right, earlier on? 

01:33:20
SILVIA L. MAZZULA I can answer that really quickly. 

01:33:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Go. 

01:33:20
SILVIA L. MAZZULA Anybody can Google you. So if you made a comment in some twitter post about how you were out in about drinking or something, your clients gonna find that information, that anything about you is available. 

01:33:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Social media. 

01:33:35
SILVIA L. MAZZULA Social media. Your clients know that. 

01:33:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Rivera, one challenge facing you that we didn't have to face? 

01:33:45
DAVID P. RIVERA Because of the, the proliferation of, of information in, in various media, umm… I think that the, the antis kind of upped for us in may ways in terms of what we're supposed to… what our, what our universe of, of possibilities are for research ideas, right. What the, what the interventions are gonna look like? I think that we have to hold a lot of information with us at any given moment. 

01:34:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. Dr. Lewis, one challenge. 

01:34:15
JIONI A. LEWIS I think one challenge is… Umm… I mean, I guess similarly to what Silvia was saying. Umm… you know, I, I like to post a lot about different, you know, post articles or other things that have to do with umm… various forms of oppression. And, and I guess the challenge is umm… is, is that, that line between your personal and professional selves online, right? So, umm…, you know, I haven't. I think I said yesterday when I asked Kevin a question. You know, I haven't. I don't have twitter because I've seen the backlash that, that has come particularly women of color scholars who have been targeted because of something they put on twitter and they have been fired, right? And so that, that balance and trying to figure out, like wanting to use social media to disseminate my work and umm… have more of an impact in lots of ways. But also the challenge of how to do that in a way that umm…. doesn't, you know, risk your job completely I guess. 

01:35:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, Dr. Miller. 

01:35:10
MATTHEW J. MILLER I think the trainee model we have, the scientist practitioner or scholar practitioner models are really have limited validity overtime. And I think as we think about advocacy and social justice, our trainee models don't do a good job in addressing that. One program in the country has this excellent model and at the same time they have more training components to complete. So I think that, that figuring out, probably this, this next generation figuring out how we can be meaningful and relevant to suicidal issues and how our trainee models prepare students and I think we're not, we're not doing it right now. 

01:35:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. What's the one challenge we face that we didn't, Doris? 

01:35:55
DORIS F. CHANG I think, I think as we become more invited umm… into spaces outside of the clinic, umm… I think we do need to change our training approach, so that we can, we can help students um… really understand how the tools that we have available to us as clinicians, as counselors, as psychologists, umm… can be applied to, to address social problems. So how can we help us, ourselves to think more broadly outside of this, this sort of smaller space of intervention to thinking about community, thinking about, you know, bringing psychology out into the world. There's a lot of, you know… I met a institution that really uh… focuses on design and really thinking about what we have to offer as far as designing social innovations. Umm… There is a lot of exciting opportunity and yet our, our training models are still pretty static umm… and, and really narrowing our students umm… focus to the dyadic relationship that, that group counseling context and there so much more I think we could do. 

01:37:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Milo? 

01:37:05
MILO L DODSON Definitely, definitely wanna reiterate the umm… the challenge of an online presence in the social media. I also want to be able to add that, as we have more means of communication, and we have more avenues to pursue our own professional dreams and aspirations that it's that much more important with umm… you know, an online presence or with social media to also remain present in our uh… connections with people and have meaningful interactions to not think that you have to be so wide spread across all these different means, to have more ends kind of to piggyback of what you were, uh… your presentation yesterday. That you can have a few more salient means and have more of a proliferation of ends, as you don't have to do everything, so… 

01:37:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM We were talking about the difference between the means by which we live, not outpacingly ends for which we live, and how that is always a contemporary challenge. Umm… In our few moments left, I want to take us down little deep. The great scholar (inaudible ) argued that, if you allow a people to control the way you think, you do not have to assign him to an inferior status of necessary, they will seek it for them self. Other people have written about the same thing, Naeem Akbar talks about the chains and images of psychological slavery. What oppression does even in growing up as educated folk and new generations of scholars is, you know, it shackles us in ways that it is interested but what oppressors, are good about doing is letting the shackles off of your hands and ankles, as long as I still keep the shackle on your brain. If there were a shackle on your brain, and you are like this, one, umm… shackle I got to get loose. What would that be? What's that one shackle you wanna like uh… as a new scholar, as you move into the mid career and later stages of your career that you wanna decouple and make some progress on. Let me start down there, go. 

01:39:20
SILVIA L MAZZULA So you are asking for us personally? 

01:39:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-huh… 

01:39:20
SILVIA L MAZZULA Umm… 

01:39:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Oh, we are trying to get real personal up in here. 

01:39:30
SILVIA L MAZZULA Uh… that the reality is the impostor syndrome. 

01:39:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Impostor syndrome. 

01:39:30
SILVIA L MAZZULA That's the thing that, I think I will buy wraith for the rest of my life. 

01:39:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, so we're gonna take that hackle off, back to Rivera. 

01:39:40
DAVID P RIVERA Umm… not being good enough, which is pretty much the impostor syndrome. 

01:39:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah, so we could take that shackle off, Dr. Lewis? 

01:39:45
JIONI A LEWIS So I was gonna say fear and so, and similarly this impostor syndrome I think, there's always a lot of fear to stand up for what is right and say, umm… and stand up for injustice at times, uh… for fear of that backlash and umm… yup, that's it. 

01:40:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM So we're taking this shackle off. Dr. Miller? 

01:40:10
MATHEW J MILLER Umm… that you're not really doing a great job until you secured a million dollar, multi million dollar grant or published in American Psychologist. 

01:40:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Umm… Just take that shackle off. Dr. Chang? 

01:40:20
DORIS F CHANG Umm… I think just to feel more entitled umm… can I tell a tiny story? 

01:40:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM You can tell three tiny stories. No, go, go, yes. 

01:40:30
DORIS F CHANG Oh may I so, I… This is the story I want… 

01:40:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Short period of time, so go for it. 

01:40:35
DORIS F CHANG So umm… So I think, I think its facultative color and it's women. In a, in academy we are often asked to do things that are, what male colleagues aren't asked to do. And I, we carry around this, this burden of feeling like, oh, I, I should do it 'cause it's, it's, it's the right thing to do and, and we don't want to make people mad at us and we wanna please others and so we have all of these, these are really automatic ways of, of responding to these kinds of, to me at least I, I'll say, I do. And umm… I was sharing with uh… some, a group of colleagues in my, in my institution that, that I was feeling umm… pressured to kind of save the department in this one sort of thorny bureaucratic administrative issue that had been presented to me as a problem that I should fix and. And my… And we just developed in our small group, umm… a mental image to help us defuse these sort of maladaptive patterns, of thought that trap us and to feeling obligated. Umm… to fix things for others and make life more comfortable for others, it's more privileged and so… So we decided to have this mantra of like, to imagine umm… that to imagine that we had, imagine that we had a pink penis. And how having a pink, and it was, it had to be a pink, a pink penis or a white penis, how that would change, how we sat and presented our views. And it was like just… 

01:41:55
MATHEW J MILLER I'm imagining that right now. 

01:42:00
DORIS F CHANG It was like, oh, my god, all of a sudden I'm sitting up a little taller. I'm feeling like I can demand something and to even imagine like, "why would you ask me to do that?" Like, "how dare you ask me to do that?" And it was not to say that this is something we should emulate like we, we wanna be like white men. But, the, the power that comes with it was so liberating to just try on, umm… in that space that, it has become like a, a funny visual that actually has had this sort of secret power to it. So I, I, yes I said penis on video at the winter round table. 

01:42:30
SILVIA L MAZZULA Pink… 

01:42:30
DORIS F CHANG But if you take that… Thank you. Uh… We found it very helpful. So that was helpful, that was sort of a coupling and shackling something for me. 

01:42:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Unshackled it. Hey! Dr. Dodson 

01:42:45
MILO L DODSON Well, the, following that imagery, 

01:42:50
[sil.] 

01:42:55
MILO L DODSON Umm… Oh, man. 

01:42:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM What's the one shackle that you wanna be able to take off? 

01:42:55
MILO L DODSON I think being, being okay with simplicity and being okay with more meaningfulness, umm… so then that way I'm not trying do more to have more, doing less to have more. Because I think for me as a, as a black man you often feel hyper, hyper visible and criminalized, but also being invisible and also feeling like an impostor at the same time. So I've, you know, support myself to cross uh… I mean I went to, you know, seeing and I'm doing this camping, umm… all these other things. But being okay with doing less because less is more just, simplicity. 

01:43:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM So we're gonna take that shackle off. All right, in the spirit of reciprocity, all right, 'cause I've been asking you like lots of questions, all right. So if you had one question you wanted to ask, what would that be? Go. 

01:44:00
DAVID P RIVERA We are asking you. 

01:44:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes, go. 

01:44:05
DAVID P RIVERA I'd like to hear what your thoughts are on, the um… that last question. 

01:44:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM On the shackle? For me I think it's, it's always been about umm… trying to force yourself to be self aware enough, and to make that notion of sacrifice real. Umm… part of what I talked to audience about yesterday was that old piece of African wisdom I'd stylized about. Life at its best as a creative synthesis of opposites and fruitful harmony, your greatest strength can also be your greatest weakness. I have a warrior spirit. I shared birthday with Nat Turner. So if you want to know where my warrior spirit comes from, it's kind of in that space. But sometime that warrior spirit gets me into a little bit of trouble. Umm… so sometimes I'm more hesitant to roar like a lion when I ought to. And sometimes umm… I roar like a lion when I ought to be kind of quite and listen. So it's really trying to balance those particular spaces for me. That's from me what's most important. Other folk? 

01:45:20
DORIS F CHANG I am… Can I? 

01:45:20
MILO L DODSON Kick that shackle off. 

01:45:25
MATHEW J MILLER Take it off. 

01:45:30
DORIS F CHANG Um… I'm, I would love to here more about how you navigate um… the, the bureaucracy is, of academia because it, it gets um… You know, people that look like us are fewer and fewer the higher you go and yet you are way up there. So, how, how, how did you do that? 

01:45:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM James Brown asked the song years ago, and um… I think it was Bobby, who was his sax player, and front man said, what you gonna do? James said, Bobby, I don't know. So, you know, uh… I don't know how you do it. Umm… What I do know I think is that, uh… I never lose side of the fact that my bill need to be in the spaces I occupy was guaranteed by people who came long before I did and sacrificed the whole bunch. So for me I over debt. So I never approach anything that I do professionally, even personally without a recognition of the ancestors and the elders who came before, the spirit that sent out of me by the creator and the death that I owe, you know, for being able to go forward. So it's hard for me to engage life with that sense of fear. Uh… What cripples a lot of us is fear. And the only thing they can do for, to you is, you know, either take a job, take up something but, you know, I can get another job, so it doesn't stop you from being able to do that. Um… I shared with folk yesterday, you can actually have a plate of food and a net fly on the plate of food and run away with a crumb. And take the most powerful person you think exists in the universe and that person does not have the power to call the little net back and say, bring me back my crumb. But they call us, and they order us, but can't order the smallest insect in creation. I never give people more power than they deserve. If the one person I fear in this world, that's the creator, sure to that. Everybody else is the human being. We got time for one more question, then this wrap up time for you all. Uh… Miller? 

01:47:50
MATHEW J MILLER So, it breaks my heart to see marginalized communities kind of engaging, uh… on how we, you know, my group is more important than your. How would you solve that problem? Just real quickly. 

01:48:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM I we're hoping the audience bought their sleeping bag with them today, right? Umm… For me I think, it's always important to build coalition across demographic boundary. And part of what we have to do is to help people learn to advocate across the demographic boundaries that they represent. We get so nationalistic in our politics sometime, whether it's black Latino, Asian, Indian, gay, straight, you know, whatever it is, feminist, that, we, we are so tunnel vision that we can't engage across that demographic boundary. And so part of what I tried to remember um… is that African senate notion of consubstantiation, it means elements of the universe of same substance. So whether we all represent a different demographic or not, you know, we are all of the same substance that need to be doing. So that when I advocate for you, it is me advocating for myself as well. I may also reminded as Dr. King said, that we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality and we are tied to a single garment of destiny. All right. I'll never forget that, that it takes all of us to be able to make a change in the world, and not just one of us. My patch, your patch, is not big enough but collectively we can do anything. That's what I'd say. So as we prepare to wind up, the great journalists, psychiatrists, friends, you know, argued that each generation had a relative obscurity, you must reach out and seek to fulfill its legacy or betray it. When you think about the legacy that you want to leave, what all the said and done, and what do you hope you would have accomplished in your life? Dr. Mazzula? 

01:50:00
SILVIA L MAZZULA Umm… 

01:50:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM What's the legacy you want to leave? 

01:50:05
[sil.] 

01:50:10
SILVIA L MAZZULA I think of the uh… the saying that you, you are what you think you are, that we can be whatever we think we can be at any point in my, in our lives. Umm… And for a lot of us, that is a myth, because how can you think of something that's not around you? And I think of so many spaces that are uncharted that there's people that don't look like us. So those images are just not there for us to internalize and think that we can be whatever we want. Umm… so for me is providing relatable faces in spaces that are uncharted and spaces where, we are the minority. I believe that strongly, are narrative it matters. So I'd hope that everyone in this room talks about their experience. We've all made it. You guys have all made it, every single person in this room has made it into some space, that is a space where marginalized communities are not umm… traditionally at. So share your stories, provide images for others, so that when they think what they can be, there's possibilities, there's hope. 

01:51:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. Oh, yeah. Dr. Rivera, what's the legacy you want to leave? 

01:51:30
DAVID P RIVERA That's a hard one to think about right now in my… Hopefully I just have a, another half life to live. I've been kind of breaking my, my life in, in half umm… but it's complete um… kind of, as Emerson says about success, leaving the world a bit better than when I found it. I think that's overall what I, what I want to do, what I strive to do. It kind of guides me in umm… my daily interactions overall. And I want to, going along with what Silvia said. I want to be able to provide those mirrors and those mirroring opportunities to people umm… that don't have them plentifully around them. And that includes all of us in here, where most of us umm… probably all of us and some contexts in our life don't have those positive mirroring images around us to help us, umm… self actualize ourselves. 

01:52:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. Dr. Lewis, what's the legacy you wanna leave? 

01:52:25
JIONI A LEWIS Umm… I think, you know, being the change I wish to see in the world right, umm… and so really engaging in social justice and umm… and being an advocate in, in my various roles. So as a researcher, umm… as a teacher, umm… the service I do, you know as I said earlier that being really important, umm… engaging in social justice, mentoring umm… and, and, really kind of training the next generation of umm… counseling psychologist who will be um… these multi cultural social justice scholars and so that's the legacy I'd like to leave. 

01:53:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM All right. Dr. Miller, what about your legacy? 

01:53:05
MATHEW J MILLER Uh… just to be known as the best counseling psychologist in history. Uh… I'm like three quarters of the way there, umm… I, I, I struggled with. This is the question I fear the most. And I guess it would be umm… mythologically, conceptually rigorous, innovative umm… but did something that, that actually withstand time in terms of the, the publications might not but may be uh… approach to solving umm… some kind of issue. 

01:53:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. Chang, legacy? 

01:53:40
DORIS F CHANG My aspiration is to be of as funny as Matt Miller. Uh… I mean, every, I think, every, everything that, everyone else has said umm…and I guess back to the theme of wanting uh… My students wanting other students that follow us to, to feel like they, that they belong here, that, that they are not impostors, that they don't have the same insecurities and, and threats to our sense of competence that we've all struggled with, like that would be such a gift I think if we could pass on that, that sense of power and entitlement. 

01:54:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Good. Dr. Dodson, your legacy? 

01:54:20
MILO L DODSON My legacy, I, I would say three main things. First one being leading with compassion and not just being, not just accepting, not just being tolerable but actually loving and being kind and compassionate to everybody. Those who identify with and those who I don't identify with, even if I'm gonna have a disagreement with somebody, I can still disagree with compassion. Umm… the second thing I would say would be humility. Umm… The most alien feeling honestly on this stage today for me has been humility, uh… sitting, sitting with you as my mentor of seven, eight years. Umm… sitting with my research family, big sister and, Jioni who you know, checked me so hard just like a big sister would in my first year grad school uh… about my male privilege but checked me in a way where again like, a big sister, she really pushed me to see my blind spots and to grow in ways I couldn't have on my own. Umm… and last I guess with, with Matt, not to go into that uh… middle age feeling that you have before, but Matt was a post doc when I was a sophomore junior and undergrad, and I, I promise I'm not trying to ditch you there. But I share that with, with seriousness because I think, you know, as a young, young man of Colorado PWI in Rotterdam, it was really difficult to do research a lot of time and Matt was like that guy as you saw today, was both smart and funny and driven all at the same time. And that's a, it's a really humbling feeling for me to be sharing the stage with you, with you today. Umm… And I think being, honestly the last thing, so compassion, humility and excellence, just being, being great and understanding that you can still be great and you can be excellent with humility. 

01:56:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM That's all right. Umm… We now have a few more minutes and what we'd like to do is to open up for some of your questions for the audience. So I'm gonna ask you to make your questions quick. And we have microphones on either side of the room. And we'll see if we can take as many questions as we can and we'll try to get quick responses for you. So those who have questions, please line up this way and we'll see if we can get some of the questions. Oh, we'll bring the mic to you either one. And introduce yourself for us, please. 

01:56:55
CATHERINE COLEECHE Okay, my name is Catherine Coleeche. Umm… I'm not really sure this is a quick question, so sorry. Umm… 

01:57:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM You like little sorry, big sorry or what? 

01:57:05
CATHERINE COLEECHE We'll see after I ask. 

01:57:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

01:57:05
CATHERINE COLEECHE Umm… One thing that hasn't featured a lot in the discussion here is, today is religion. And one thing that I am curious about is, I find that religion has the power to both create spaces to umm… span cultural barriers but also at the same time has the power to create very strong barriers. Umm… So how do you navigate integrating religion into your own personal profile and especially in the world of academia? 

01:57:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Scholars? 

01:57:40
MATHEW J MILLER That's a, a tricky one umm… I grew up in the, you know, in churches and institution. I have a lot of experience in years, umm… being socialized into that. And so I think for me it's, it's very tricky because I agree that… You know, I think there is a bias in our field that people who are religious are, are close minded are and, but I do, so I think we missed the strength peace, the spiritual, I mean a, bigger than religion but spiritual uh… connection. Connectedness is a real strength in a support system, but I think it takes a real critical I to… and perspective in thinking about how are we perpetuating oppression. And so I think that it, it deserves more discussion in the field. Umm… And for me personally it has really been, you know, making sure that I am not diminishing the role and importance of religion in other peoples lives. Well, at the same time how do I make meaning when I think about my values for equity and, and justice. And when I see what's on the media and, and the simple representations of what being religious means, uh… but it, so it's very complex, uh… and I think it simply needs more discussion. 

01:58:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Any others? 

01:59:00
MILO L DODSON I think for me I've, I've shared umm… a major feeling for me is, is love in a lot of different ways. And being a, being a catholic umm… I think I often equate love with, with God. And as the Bible says you know God is love. And being able to understand that when I do engage in the social justice, because a lot of people who are gonna say, well, as a catholic you are supposed to be anti this and anti that. But for me the underlying theme and the underlying feeling is love. So if I 'm being loving and I'm compassioned I'm not going to make homophobic statements. I'm not going to talk about anything outside of, of that, and, and umm… not being loving. So when I, you know, do even engage umm… the choirs, you know, a kind of a catholic base choir, you have to be religious to be in a choir. Umm… You know, but I'll, I'll talk to the kids as a youth director about black lives matter and above everything else going on across the country in a spirit of love. And, you know, some times, you know some of the parents may not necessarily agree with that, some of the parents on, you know, being Facebook friends now, aren't going to be vibing with that, but I stand firm in, in that, that feeling of love and that being a divine feeling. 

02:00:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM For me I think lastly I'll say them and go to the next question. There's a difference for me between spirituality and religion. And religiosity in the way that is practiced are, the theology and the rituals that primarily men put in place in order to both worship the creator, whatever they call him or her and give thanks. But those rituals are often times reflected in the personalities of the people who develop them, and sometimes uh… straight from the core principals I think that they should be adhering to. So having grown up catholic, alter boys in churches, you know, the whole nine yards had a split with the Catholic Church in a while, partly because of just the profound incongruence between what they preached and how they lived. And so I have now, I am still very spiritual, I either go to a Baptist Church or an A.M.E. Church is also just a little bit more collectively rich for me, which is important. But even as you look at some of the inconsistencies that you find in almost any church, I never lose side of the fact that spirituality at its core, and your relationship to the divine force in the universe ought to be different than the rituals that men and women put in place to practice and that's what gets people bugged out. So I'll try to leave that for the drama and stay focused on keeping my head to disguise. So… Let's go here. Introduce yourself. 

02:01:50
RANDALL SCOTT MCLOKLIN My name is… I am Randall Scott Mcloklin II. I'm a third year here at the counseling psychology department at Teachers College. And umm… my question is, there was a lot of talk about how, as early professionals, there is navigating the system in which is called academia, and how their consequences to, to may be speaking up in certain kinds of ways umm… as professionals. Now with that in mind, I'm also thinking of educating and training our next set of scholars. And how the intersection between, of what kinds of students get to be in our training halls and then the kinds of reasons for why students may first of all not get there. And then once they are there, how can we best support them, umm… specifically around issues of the disability, learning disabilities and just general intelligence uh… kind of measures in assessing of our, of our students. Certain students get assessed, certain students don't and certain students get access, the resources at different points in time on their careers, so how can we as professionals umm… better aid that process? 

02:03:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, good question. So we'll turn to our panel. Let me invite you to step up, you to go over here behind her so we can get you a little quicker. Okay. Panel? Let's get, get a couple of answers to that. 

02:03:15
SILVIA L MAZZULA If I heard correctly I think the, the question was, how do we increase the pipeline of more students have access to either resources or entry? Um… in, one of the ways that I find important is, first as the ones that are on this side of the table need to be at the table, or the one that are on this side of the desk, need to be at the table. To, to bring up those issues, whether you are talking about what assessments are given to the students, what uh… what matters in the application process. There's got to be people on this side, they are activists and umm… and, and pushing for diverse students to, to come in through the doors. 

02:03:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Good. One more? 

02:03:50
DAVID P RIVERA And I think that we need to conceptualize this issue as Sylvia mentioned pipeline umm… from the beginning. We uh… often times and I also do student development theory work, umm…so those student development theories propose models of optimal development, that were not normed on the majority of society, but are still well in placed in life and we need to start to dismantle those. We need to think about from the very beginning, we can't concentrate just on the pool of undergrads. So as scholars we need to research these issues in the development of, of younger people, I'm talking about from birth onward. 

02:04:25
RANDALL SCOTT MCLOKLIN Thank you. 

02:04:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM All right, let's go here. 

02:04:30
DAVID OMEN Umm… so I have, you know, I have seen the power of social media in the digital age. When I first noticed it was during umm… remember the campaign, it gets better, for GOBTQQI whatever youth. Umm… that it made a big difference. But I feel that one thing that you (inaudible ) me, to start to talk about it yesterday when you talked about how long you walk across the stage and how long it takes to mail a letter, you have to write it out and then you wait. How do we deal like, we can harness the power of digital age but how do we work against, how it's impacting social skills of our youth, and our generation to have conversations and have real voices, not through typing or tolerating? Tolerate, having a developing of patience that if someone doesn't text you back, it's like a new, we are creating an immediate generation where, if I don't hear back from someone immediately that creates a tension or an anxiety, that's not really rational. So I just wanted to know listening, what would you, you know, hearing from you, what you think about that about how we target that piece of the digital age which is challenging to our youth. 

02:05:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, good question. Let's go to a couple of other folks. 

02:05:50
MATHEW J MILLER I just was gonna say, I mean, I, I my students make fun of me because they are much more tech, technologically savvy than I am, umm… but I, you know, I do think that we are at a time when we are really redefining appropriate social skills. And the idea of what is rational, it makes sense because, if I explain to my grandfather who recently passed away, the way people might meet a significant other now, that just, that, that doesn't make sense. But it makes lot of sense for a lot of people in the room. So I think part of it is, is our responsibility to evolve with the, you know, the thing about like, the idea of kind of generalize ability overtime. What do we mean when we measure social skills and, an appropriate behavior, and I think that differs 30 years ago from 30 years from now. Umm… At least my kids will teach me that soon I'm sure. 

02:06:40
DORIS F CHANG Umm… I, I have a, I guess on the flipside umm… I've had the experience of working with clients who, who feel that, who, who, feel that texting enables them to practice emotional regulation skills. So if it's a, if it's a person who, who responds and, and is super reactive and I, and it finds the heart to reign in those behaviors umm… even though they are not in mind with their intention. They have actually found that you can have meaningful conversation through texting in ways that allows them to actually present a self that is congruent with, you know, their values and beliefs. Umm… in ways that's incept for some folks, face-to-face interaction is, can be deactivating. So I've definitely seen the upside of people actually using it to facilitate, actually deeper and more, more intentional connections. Uh… But I, I, yeah I like the point you made about, about us not assuming that you can't connect in a meaningful way, but I think going back to the question of how is, umm… asking the person themselves to what degree do you feel like this isn't adversely affecting your feeling of connection. Umm… And being open to being surprised, because I think we, we kind of have a bias to something. It's, it's, it's a bad thing and I don't think it, it always is. 

02:07:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So at some point is gonna be a phenomenological experiences that she need to everybody but what I worry about as a caution is whether or not technology is creating kind of a, a socially awkward generation, that doesn't know how to just engage fork in the more authentic ways in which we used to do it. And you know, rituals and other stuff is just different about how you connect with people. And there is advantage as you hear and a disadvantage. The trick is to try to figure out, one is at advantages, someone is not to be able to do that. Thank you for you, and you didn't introduce yourself. Introduce yourself. 

02:08:30
DAVID OMEN David Omen.(ph) Thank you. 

02:08:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dave, nice to see you. Let's go here. 

02:08:30
KAREN CHIMAYO Hi, I'm Karen Chimayo. I'm a Professor at Umass Boston. 

02:08:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Nice to see you. 

02:08:35
KAREN CHIMAYO Nice to see you as well, Thomas. Umm… I guess the first thing I would just like to say is thank you, umm… like from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Your comments have inspired me, and moved me, and made me think very deeply. Umm… And I really appreciate the risks that you have taken here. 

02:08:55
DORIS F CHANG Thank you. 

02:08:55
KAREN CHIMAYO Umm… And because I would not want to think about something I should have said that I did not. I would also just like to say that I, I missed the voices of Native Americans and mean how peoples. I know we can't always have every representation, but I did miss that. Umm… and my question is, "doing this work takes a toll, um… and we are motivated in many ways by the pain that we see in our communities and in people like us. And I am wondering what wisdom, because you have wisdom, um… you might have about, how do you deal with that pain yourselves? 

02:09:40
DAVID P RIVERA Real quick, it's not a quick, very small response to a very larger response but, yeah this, the, the idea when we have this conversations all the time. These, I had it with uh…, you two yesterday. So we've had this conversations about how difficult it is, to teach, to research, to therapies if you will, umm… as a marginalized person because of every thing else that comes with that, just because of the identity that we bring into the room, into the classroom, into the project. And so one thing that I, I really using, think odd for technology I have uh… a click, a group on text and one of them is here. Umm… but there are four of us umm… and I have a couple of others but this four we constantly everyday are sharing about the, the scars if you will, the, the pain, right. Now looking for a solution if you will but just being able to vent that. And if weren't for technology I would have to wait to do that, but I could do that actually, sometimes in class, the students are doing something, I'm like, so this just happened, give me again. And that right there is very healing for me. That's very healing and I'm very thankful for technology in that way. 

02:10:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So part of the answer is creating your own internal support system and umm… closing that nick group, you know everybody got a positive run to it, but it has somebody that they kinda connect to. They allow them to kind of comfort even in the moment, right? So that somebody knows it that you're, you're, you're able to be in that space and even being able to give voice to that right, is a healing process. Okay other folk… 

02:11:15
JIONI A LEWIS Oh, I would, well, I'll just add, I think that's something I'm still, you know, kind of struggling with and working on. And I, I agree with David um… that it's for me finding, building that support network of other scholars, particularly scholars of color umm… in academia is really important. And, and finding allies umm… even white allies in umm… my institutions, who are having mentors, umm… who, who are more senior, umm… to, to have his allies and then, you know, have other people across campus. Umm… you know, I also have a text, text chain of people umm… who, one person's in the audience as well, umm… and a crew of people that, you know, we kind of all went to grad school together and all struggled together as women of color. And, and I think that having that is important, if you can't necessary have it in your program, um… which is ideal to have it in your program. But if you can't having it umm… in other ways and other spaces and using technology to do it. 

02:12:15
SILVIA L MAZZULA I've also… I mean I, I also have the, the text groups and it's definitely important to call someone. Umm… what I have done personally is uh… read notes to myself, as if I was eight years old or five years old or umm… and giving her the strength to deal with whatever she thought she couldn't deal with when she grew up and that has been very powerful for me. Specially umm… a lot of times the struggle comes out when the impostor syndrome for me comes up, when we start talking about issues of racism in the classroom, or anything and you get challenged or what's your degree or why, (inaudible ) are you talking about this information you know. So I was go back to kind of giving power to that little girl in me. In addition to calling my colleagues and the responses, when I called Kevin umm… about me coming hear pregnant, and his response was, what would a white man do or, or, what, what, you know, that's always the response, and that kind of instant feedback via text is like, "Okay, yes," it's not the way, I mean, pink penis, but it's similar safer all in all. 

02:13:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM It's all good. The umm… part of the challenge I think we always wanna manage is, I think you hear consistently developing a support system of people who know. 

02:13:30
SILVIA L MAZZULA Yeah. 

02:13:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM But I think for this generation as well, it's important to contextualize struggle. In my office I keep two pictures, one is of Brother Malcolm on one side of the wall, and the ancestors in the slave dungeon in the Castle da Elmina in Cape Coast in Ghana. Because it always reminds me to contextualize struggle and I tell myself as I tell my students. Whenever stuff gets too crazy, it ain't a slave ship. And if they could get through that, I mean, we can get through some inconveniences, it's kind of making your day a little bit trouble. You can't get that little bit of frustration to do something, if they can get through that, it allows to arrive at the spaces we occupy now. We can't get through this little bit of stuff, we're the best train we got. And can't get to this little bit of stuff, you just got to contextualize struggle. Oh, go. Introduce yourself. 

02:14:20
BRIAN ROSADOS Brian Rosados, uh… first year at University of Oregon doctoral program. Umm… my question is the following. We've been talking a lot about this idea of us and them. As Afro-Latino immigrant dreamer. A lot of times it's us versus us. The work that we put in is tiring and it takes a lot of energy. So how do we or how do you as professors and faculty help your students and help yourselves to engage in all this, while also creating collaboration and the idea that, us versus us really exist in world, often I asked to choose, who are you gonna be today, so…? 

02:14:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Great question. Panel? 

02:14:55
DORIS F CHANG Umm… I, I actually found mindfulness practice to be hugely helpful especially living kindness because I think finding ourselves, appreciating the fact that we are interconnected as others have said is, it helps to breakdown that sense that this is my fight or your fight or who's benefiting. And um… in, in, that work happens in a deep internal place that… Oh, I think opens us up to others experiences umm… And, and it, and it, it also umm… I feel like it's also a tool for umm… as a coping starchy even for students in the moment and me to just be like, just breathe, just breathe. And um… and cultivating a stance of, of umm… compassion and uh… and umm… breaking down these divisions between self… This is related to the, the question of spirituality and my Buddhist orientation. And umm… and, and, and tapping into whether the spiritual belief or there's sort of values can help us cut through I think this, the, the more artificial divisions, umm… based on political identity and other things. 

02:16:10
MILO L DODSON I would say, for me, it starts with similar to a love and kindness. It starts with a sort of umm… sense of self compassion, to be able to understand when you are saying us versus us kind of, not just talking about who the them is not and, and who the us is, but really saying who, who am I and how do I engage with other people. And then to kinda take a step further them to branch out a little bit, to then understand, well, where is this division coming from, what sort of beliefs do I have, or how are my identities and my lens is playing out here that impacts me to break it up to say, who this first us is and who the second us is. And I think often umm… being, being by racial myself, there's often that, that jext position umm… of understanding my blackness and my whiteness and being raised, only by the, the whites I have in my family. Umm… so understanding, again starting from within, but then kinda going and seeing like how am I breaking this up in the first place and doing that with self compassion. 

02:17:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, good. All right, thank you for that question. 

02:17:15
BRIAN ROSADOS Thank you. 

02:17:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Umm… we are out of time but we got three poking lines. I'm gonna ask each of you, uh-ah… don't run nowhere. Don't panic on me. So I'm gonna ask each of you to ask your questions without us responding and then I'll ask the panel to dis-respond to whichever question you can get. Let me make sure you get everybody. So go. Introduce yourself and give us a question. 

02:17:35
MACH EXLES My name is Mach Exles,(ph) I'm here, first year master student here at the counseling program here at TC. My question to you guys is, you guys doing, done a lot of research and a lot of academic work. How do we simplify all that work umm… and bring it to, for like a bit to street level or colocalize it for people who don't understand it. 

02:17:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So how do you simplify and bring it to the street? 

02:17:55
MACH EXLES Yeah. 

02:17:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM All right, outside of this academia? 

02:17:55
MACH EXLES Outside of… 

02:18:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM I got it, go. 

02:18:00
NICK Hi, I'm Nick. I'm also a first year's master student in the counseling program here at TC. Umm… first of all I just wanted to start with a thank you for showing so much strength and just talking about your vulnerabilities and accepting them for all of us, 'cause that's a constant struggle and in that Dr. Mazzula, something that you said very early on really resonated me in regards to, you mentioning that a lot of the choices you felt you made to prove to your oppressors that you could, now times be better than those that they actually believed in. So for the panelists, I'm just wondering how all of you have worked with kinds of those feelings and how you've gotten to a point of may be accepting those and also surpassing them to having a level of self confidence to be here in front of us and also just be comfortable with that, and also just really able to own it and go from there. 

02:18:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, so taking to the streets, how do we break through the doubt, to empower ourselves, and let's face. Paraphrase is good enough? 

02:18:55
NICK Yes. 

02:18:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, cool, go. That's when captain skills coming to work. 

02:19:05
SILVIA L MAZZULA That's the, what skills? 

02:19:05
LISA STORM My name is Lisa Storm. I'm actually an alumni of Teachers College. Umm… and my question is as an educator, I run a high school in Connecticut that has a digital pathways, digital media pathway focus. Umm… and I find our high school students are actually quite sophisticated umm… in their digital knowledge. How might you provide me with a token of wisdom to take back to my team about umm… teaching young people to use umm… positive social activism to learn how to make that a part of our program? 

02:19:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM So using pathway to social activism, taking it to the streets, conquering the doubt to empower ourselves. Responses. 

02:19:50
MATHEW J MILLER Start looking outside of the traditional academic pathways for communicating in disseminated knowledge. So for me I've been looking at film festivals to produce videos and put uh… psychological base content in a way that it is meaningful for people who don't know what we are talking about. 

02:20:05
DAVID P RIVERA So taking it to the streets we need to reword what we were taught, to say. So one quick example, the tripod type model of cultural competence, I use that as a framework for every training I give to every level from children to senior citizens. I don't say tripod type, three parts, right. So it is very simple but we need to do that more often because we getting grained with these long words and terminologies that are not accessible even amongst ourselves often, but for the, for, for others. 

02:20:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Other folks. 

02:20:40
JIONI A LEWIS Well I, I'll jump on umm… your question. I think some of what umm… Sylvia was also saying, may be think about that, trying to be the superwoman sometimes umm… When you are trying to defy those stereo types and that can take a toll. And so I think for me umm… I'm trying to learn how to, and, and kind of what Doris was saying about taking on all this additional responsibility to fix things. So I'm on my department diversity council and a campus so I'd want and, doing all this stuff and realizing like, I can't do it all. And so needing to start to say, no, and I think that's important umm… that's an important piece for me. 

02:21:15
DORIS F CHANG Umm… in terms of, they taking it to the streets question I think another really great model is participatory action research, umm… and really engaging communities and identifying the questions that are most important. Umm… and then therefore, I think that also could even, you know, help to create that pipeline that we're talking about because communities can then see, like, oh, these are… This is, this is uh… a viable path, you know, for, for people in our community and I think, I can imagine… I, I think that our presence in these communities umm…also has its own ripple effect umm… 

02:21:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Good. Any other? 

02:21:55
MILO L DODSON I would just say again for the, the streets umm… being able to really understand what the need is, to really listen. Because I think there is often times assumptions or there's, there's may be even hypothesis that we have and really understanding what's needed, and also using language that actually makes sense. Umm… And to, to understand that we are that knowledge to bring and to actually show the connection and the investment in a community that way. 

02:22:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. 

02:22:20
MATHEW J MILLER For, for the educator umm… umm… but just helping them think long term or less than right now, because as we know all the stuff is going to follow them. And so be, to be strategic in disclosing 

02:22:35
SILVIA L MAZZULA And I would add to the educator too, to have something that's meaningful for them. Uh… so I'm thinking of the new umm… the 11-year-old African American, a young girl who just started to hashtag a thousand black bucks for girls, umm… and it came out of just her saying she was tired of reading about why boys and dogs. Umm… and this created a, a movement about the lack of representation and books. But my point is, for them to have something that means something to them personally, not to the educator, right. So what's important for them? 

02:23:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah I think that's a, that's viable. As we are prepared to close umm… I think for the, the teacher in the digital age I think that's so essential but being able to define and frame your own discourse, it really is a video tape, not a snapshot. And so, you know, convincing them that, that's the case. For the empowerment question, I would argue that real confidence is never an over abundance of self-esteem, it's an absence of a fear failure. If you got to break through the doubt to get through the empowerment peace, you simply have to lose that fear, all right. People who do great stuff in life, if you ask them to do, no, he won't do it before you discovered it… Most of men, if they are honest with you will say uh-uh-uh… But they'll say I wasn't afraid to try even if I had to fail a couple of times before I succeeded. You just have to do that. As far as taking it to the streets, you have to stop caring about all those other kind of traditional pathways, you know, that are there. One of the great people I learned from was, Joe White,(ph) who was my first mentor. Who, when he developed a whole discipline of black psychology. He didn't take it to general clinical psych ortho, you know, clinical or counseling psych. He took it to ebony magazine and he said that, it's a main subscription of ebony in the country and each subscription is gonna get read five times in somebody's home and somebody's barber shop whatever. Tell me one psychological journal that will reach five million people with one article, right? He didn't blink. All right. And, right? All these years later, we got whole disciplines that he discovered just because he had a sense to that. Your generation's ebony magazine is not on tweet and Twitter, it's on Facebook, it's on Myspace and even for our generations who don't use them as much, we recognize, I think the utility of being able to do that. In my generation you will see people write pamphlets. One of the most favorite things I've ever written in my life among the six books. Umm… It's a book called Psychological Storms. It's a book that's about uh… it's a pamphlets about this big, it's about 100 pages. I wrote it for people on the street. It has big print, pictures in it. It's 105 pages. It's priced at, I don't know $7 or something. And I still get letters from people on the street. I get letters from people in prison. Please send me, you know, copies of that book. Because that's where you wanted to go. And whether it gets any academic credit for me or not, I don't care. Because I didn't write it for them, I wrote it for the people on the street, you just have to stop caring about the traditional rituals that were there. I want you to umm… if you would join me in thanking what has been just a very uh… a rich panel. We are indeed blessed, uh… and all heads of the room. It's, it's, it's amazing to hear young people talk about how old they're getting right, then only you have a grey hair, you know, here and there. But umm… I'm always encouraged as our lots of my peers that the profession is in good space right now. Looking at some of the talent that we have coming up. And if we have had a chance to influence them that all, we are honored and pleased. But your job is not to be like us, your job is to take our little biddy stuff and take it to a whole different level. And we are confident that each of you can do that. So let's thank Dr. Mazzula, Dr. Rivera, Dr. Lewis, Dr. Miller, Dr. Chang, and Dr. Dodson. Thank them all if you would. 

02:26:35
[sil.] 

02:26:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM And now give it up. 

02:26:45
[sil.] 

02:26:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM So now I'm gonna have Mariel and Veronica come up and, uh… right, they're gonna be my, my ritual crew. So one on one side, one on the other. Now we uh-uh no, uh-uh-uh. Stand up for me. Stand up for me, stand up for me, this is the Roundtable, this is how we do. So this is ritual time. So let me invite our panelists to stand up. And this is phone time where they ask folks to, all right, pull the candle up. What's the app called? 

02:27:15
MARIEL BUQUE It's called Virtual Candle. 

02:27:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Virtual Candle Free. 

02:27:20
MARIEL BUQUE It looks like this. 

02:27:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM So there's no… It looks like this. So we are gonna raise the candle, Virtual Candle Free. So I'm gonna put one on one side, one on the other. It's on the iPhone. There's probably another one some place else. So while you hold your candle up right, it feels like our earth wanna (inaudible ). While you hold your candle up, I want you to touch somebody's shoulder right next to you, right. So we just kinda connect up the room. You just connect up the room. Touch somebody. All right. Grab somebody, in whose hand with a candle, you know, so everybody is connected up. Right, this is our ritual. So part of coming to the Roundtable is being able to engage in ritual, ritual folks helps us to center our consciousness on the task in hand. Why do we come to the Roundtable, we come to be affirmed. We come to learn, we come to discover, we come to be validated. We come to be excited, we come to be energized, we come right to find those places where even though we carry those psychic scars and ontological wounds and existential bruises, that happen in everyday life. We can come here and get hugged up quick and soft, so that even as we when exit from these spaces and go back out into those places we occupy on a daily basis. We can be full with the knowledge that there is release somewhere in the universe, somewhere, where somebody is talking my language, somebody is speaking to my heart, somebody is right engaging my spirit in a way that is so meaningful that I can get by until the next time I can get back to this sacred space. In doing so, we want to thank Dr. Miville for her excellence stewardship of this Roundtable. As we ask blessings on the next coordinate of Roundtable, whoever he or she might be. And so I wanna ask everybody if you would just close your eyes a minute and we will close with a ritual that we call standing in the room. Truly in the flow of human development. Our community of multicultural scholars and practitioners and people is a river, and we who call ourselves people of humanity are standing deep in its waters. And with amazing grace, we are beginning to recognize the ancient flow of human wisdom, as well as the indelible marks of human development. The river of our multicultural community speaks to and through us. People of humanity we must listen to the laughter, and the pain and feel the sorrow and the strength of our river. Multicultural family, we are all standing in the river alone, we shall be swept away by it's kind, but united, we can know that many rivers to cross, individually we shall drown in it's depths, but combined the river shall guide us to the higher ground. Singularly, we are halted by its toured banks. But as one, the river shall carry us to a distant place. As one people, the river shall return us to the source. Multicultural family, we are standing in the river, transformed and transforming. And as we like to candle in recognition of all those who have gone before us, who have prepared the pathway that we now embrace. This candle is symbolic for what we now pass on to this new generation of scholars. In hopes that, when all is set and done, somebody will be able to say that they have done what the people loved and they create a place. And all the people say, I shade, and all the people said I shade, and all the people said I shade. Let it be so. We are done. Thank you.
