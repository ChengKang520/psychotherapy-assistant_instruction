UNKNOWN Good afternoon, welcome to Games and Well-being: Leveling Up in Our Use of Interactive Media. I'm Dr. (inaudible ). I'm a faculty member in counseling program. And I uh… I'm really excited to introduce Dr. Melanie Brewster and Nick Fortugno. Umm… Melanie Brewster is an assistant uh… Professor of Psychology in Education at Columbia University, she earned her PhD from the University of Florida. Her research focuses on marginalized groups and examines how experiences of discrimination and stigma may shape the mental health of minority group members such as LGBTQ individuals, atheists, and people of color. Dr. Brewster also examines potential resilience factors such as bicultural self-efficacy and cogni-flexibility that may promote the mental health of minority individuals. Her first book, Atheists in America, was published by Columbia University Press in 2014. She tweets about atheism, queer issues and academia @melysebrewster. And Nick Fortugno is a designer of digital and real-world games and co-founder of the game company, Playmatics, and a part-time Assistant Professor at Parsons School of Design where he teaches Game Design, Interactive design, and Thesis courses. He also help to create the school's game design curriculum. Fortugno has been designer, writer, and project manager on dozens of games, serving as Lead Designer on the downloadable blockbuster uh… Diner Dash, award-winning serious game, Ayiti: The Cost of Life, CableFAX award-winning, uh… Breaking Bad: The Interrogation, and MUSE award winner Body/Mind change as well as games with Red Bull, Disney, AMC, the Red Cross/Crescent, PBS, and USAID, nick is also a co-founder of the 10-year old come out and play street games festival, which takes place annually in New York, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh.

MELANIE WEBSTER Thanks, Daphna. Hi. So this might be a little bit of a biosample, because you're, you're here choosing to watch something on games, but umm… I just wanna start off by asking, how many of you actually would identify as a gamer? Just show off hands. Okay, there are five people. Does that include pastor? Pat recovered as well. Umm… and so if I would ask you, if you were to envision a gamer, umm… what image would you have in mind, those of you that, that are not gamers? Yeah, just yell it out. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Male. 

00:02:55
MELANIE WEBSTER Male. Okay. What else? 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN White. 

00:03:00
MELANIE WEBSTER White. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN Nerd. 

00:03:05
MELANIE WEBSTER Nerd. Okay. 

00:03:05

00:03:10
"The term 'gamer' is often used to describe people who play video games… Labeling everyone who plays video games as a gamer, however, is misguided." 

00:03:10
-Adrienne Shaw, 2011, p.29 

00:03:10
MELANIE WEBSTER Isolated. Okay, it's looking pretty bleak here. What about those of you that, that raised your hands that are gamers, does that fit your perspective as well? It just yells, (inaudible ) Okay, so it fits the stereotype pretty well in so many ways. All right, so… all right, so umm… this is from our favorite episode on South Park of the World of Warcraft episode. And I think we've covered a lot of the, the common stereotypes people have about gamers. So you imagine somebody that's kind of slovenly, umm… they are either fused with the couch or computer chair, there's food around them, they haven't shaved in a while, they either still live with their parents or they don't have any sort of partner, white, older, male typically. But, I think that we have to be umm… cautious about these dirty types in a lot of ways. However, it is true that when we say "gamer" umm… to describe somebody that plays video games, we have to realize that just because you do play video games and you play them frequently, you're not necessarily gonna take on that label as an identity label. So, Adrienne Shaw is a Professor of Media Studies at Temple University, and she writes a lot about games and social location and how these things can be umm… very deeply intertwined. Give me that clicker. So has anybody played this game before? Have you seen it? Okay, wow. Some people who don't even identify as gamers have played it. So umm… this is called Neko Atsume, and it's basically a cat collecting game. The… the goal of this game is a little bit umm… simple in some ways. So you have a patio and your goal is to get all sorts of different varieties of cats, some very rare cats to come into your patio and play with little toys that you buy them. So there's a store where you can buy a whole wide variety of games. And I highlight this to show you that this is a extremely popular game as of December 2015, 10 million downloads of this game had occurred. And I'm sure it's gone up even higher since then. So when we think about games, I think typically we go to a place where we envision something like, World of Warcraft, we envision first person shooters, umm… like, uh, what's that, Call of Duty, I don't know, we imagine all these hyper masculine games, but clearly a game about playing with cats appeals to a much wider audience. Umm… and it's very quirky, it's very clean. Oops, so again, how many of you have seen this game? Show off hands. This is the most famous game you'll probably see on the subway, see it all the time, lots of people are addicted to it and spend lots of money on it. It's called Candy Crush Saga. Umm… there's also Angry Birds which has had over 3 billion downloads across all different platforms and 3 billion in the context that there are only 7 million, uh… 7 billion people on the planet give or take, so huge number of people play these games. So I think that this highlights that there are some umm… misconceptions about who is actually a gamer? And umm… what a gamer may look like? What identities they may hold? So I think we typically imagine somebody that's, that's really young, when in reality only about a quarter of gamers are under 18, that means 75% of gamers are over 18 or adults. When we think about gender, we kind of always picture somebody that's a man or male identified whereas in reality, 44 % of game players identify as women. So when you're riding the subway, this may be somebody that's more accurately depicting a gamer in a lot of ways. And to give you some additional framing, 155 million Americans report they play video games which is a huge number, 43% of Americans play these games regularly, and the regularly stat is very important, because that means they're playing at least three hours of video games a week. And women who play games regularly tend to be older, so about umm… 43 years on average, whereas regular umm… game players who are men are about 35 years old. So, again not necessarily just relegated to youth when we think about games. And this is important especially in the framework of thinking about how often we spend or how much time we spend on, kind of, mental health and self care. And ways that are more typically associated with self care such as being in counseling. So… 59 million people in the US have received mental health treatment of some form that could even involve going to a GP and asking for a medication of some form of treatment in the past two years and that's only 18% of Americans. So contrast, people who are actually going to a, kind of, standard provider with people that are spending time playing games and I think you'll see that games could be kind of an interesting avenue for us to intersect and, and work with game designers as mental care health providers, if people already investing so much of their time on these games. So yeah, go ahead. I put in those cheesy two slides so. 

00:08:40
NICK FORTUGNO So you know that, that's well and good if games are entertainment, right? But if we're gonna try to talk about what games can do, if we wanted to leverage the extensive play of games and the extensive time in which players play game, then they kind of have to do something else. And that's the feel does this, they are around for quite a long time and it actually has become quite robust in last few years and that's basically what I called serious games or more recently impact games. The more popular term now is impact games. And impact games are basically designed, you know, this is a definition that floats around about them in a serious context. But, largely the way they are understood is that there are games that have purposes beyond entertainment. They've been designed for a purpose that's not simply to entertain but to do something else. Umm… the reason why we're moving away from the word, "serious" because serious implies that games aren't fun, and that's something that serious games designers were always very resisted to. We make fun games, but we wanna show that games do something beyond just entertainment, that's really the feel we're talking about. So, this exists in a number of different forms. Umm… there are a lot of games around education. Like it, the feel that education is embraced games actually very deeply for a number of reasons. This is one of the most famous examples, it's a game called Dragon Box. And the way that Dragon Box works is it effectively teaches you algebra by assuming a basic assumption in algebra which is that the things on either side of equal sign are equal, right? And so by teaching you that a number of symbols can be equated to be equal and then slowly resolving those symbols into that notation of your understanding Math, We can kind of impress upon children, the basic understanding of algebra which means, make everything on the left side of the equal sign the same as the right side without… To fusing them with things like Xs and Ys, and then we can slowly move them to Xs and Ys numbers, as they understand that basic principle. And this game has been widely popular, download millions of times, it is sort of commonly cited as a, as a way that education connects us with games. Umm… games have been very… uh… prominent, very recently in scientific research. Umm… the NIH has funded a number of games that whose purpose is actually to illicit new kinds of science. This again is the most famous example of it. This is the game called, "Fold it." Fold it was released umm… by a group of scientists who were working on something called protein folding. I honestly don't know what protein folding is and I'm not gonna pretend that I understand it except it basically involves these very complex molecules that are proteins and the way that they sort of forms structures, meaning fold, is really important to how that can be used by the body. So we can find medicines by like just studying the different ways that these things can be constructed, but the problem is there's so many possible constructions that computers can't run simulations in reasonable amounts of times to find them. So, the designers behind Fold it made a game with rules that determine the kinds of constructions that could be valuable and then ask players to solve puzzles around those constructions. The successful results of the constructions went to labs and then scientists would look at those to see if they had possibilities for treatment purposes and this process actually lead to potential treatments within two weeks of its release. So it was a really interesting example how game play can be used to harness sort of research effects. And then finally there's a lot of work around games in politics, and particularly games around politics. So this is uh… probably the most well-known example which is called, "iCivics," which is developed by a company called Filament games in partnership with uh… former supreme court justice (inaudible ) and its purpose is to sort of introduce people to, like, to understandings of the American democratic system and the way that they can participate in those systems. And these are being used in schools across the country to sort of introduce people to the concepts of American democracy. So, games as a feel have already understood that like we can be used for purposes outside of the most basic umm… entertainment ones, but all of that has to do with leveraging games effectively. Umm… and I would actually say that, even if you're looking at me like you've never heard any of this stuff before, I can guarantee you you've played a serious game before. Like, there's a serious game that almost everyone has played, I would almost bet that you couldn't find somebody in the United States who hadn't played it. Does anybody have any idea what game this is? 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN Oregon Trail? 

00:12:40
NICK FORTUGNO No. but good guess, Oregon Trail is a good guess. But uh… lots of people didn't have computers. It's actually much more, it's much more a pervasive than that. No, we're gonna talk about that in a second and solitaire. Solitaire, I agree that solitaire really interesting, it gets to how games can teach you the general way, but not what we're talking about today. No. The game we're talking about is basketball. So, basketball was designed by a man named Naismith in the late 19th century. And it was designed exclusively and pointedly for purpose of taking a bunch of kids who, rugby players always say a rugby players because rugby wants to claim credit for basketball, who were stuck in a gym in winter 'cause they couldn't go outside in the winter and tried to create, oh, hi. Tried to create a uh… a game that would both engage them athletically, so that they would, they would stay fit during the winter. But also teach them good behavior, because a bunch of 15-year old boys trapped in a room in winter for hours has the potential of becoming unruly. And so he designed basketball, he designed basketball taking a bunch of folk games that he knew and putting them together and if you look at the journals that Naismith has, you actually see him working through the game design. So, there's a lot of features of basketball that are specific to what he tried to do. The reason why the hoop is not on the ground, the hoop originally being the speech basket, umm… is because if you put the hoop on the ground, then kids would fight in front of it. But if you put the hoop up in the air, kids couldn't fight in front of it 'cause you have to throw the ball to get it in there anyway. In original version of basketball, you didn't have dribbling, instead it was more like ultimate Frisbee finger like game, you just pass the ball around, dribbling evolved from that. So, teamwork was really essential to the game. But you also had to run and jump and all that required endurance and strength and so kids stayed fit, and they learned to work in teams. And what's fascinating about this is, this is not some obscure little, you know, "Oh, it's game about Math, you could play in your iPad that a hundred people have seen." Like, this a game that's played by millions of people around the world right now. Organized events around basketball draw the attention of tens of millions of people. Basketball has been used effectively to organize healthy behavior and curb unruly behavior in kids in various environments, because it's been implemented in after school programs, it's implemented in, in regular school programs, it's implemented in neighborhood programs as a way to sort of channel energy and motivate people totally. And I would argue that basketball is at the forefront of people's thinking about well-being at the level of their physical well-being. And that basketball drives people to run, to lift weights, to do intervals just so they will be better at basketball. So in terms of success of a game that was designed to create a social impact and better well-being, it's really hard to top a game that you can watch on television with commercials across billions of dollars that kids around the world aspired of that. 

00:15:30
What about games and mental health? 

00:15:30
MELANIE WEBSTER So umm… I think there's a lot of evidence for games that inspire physical health for games that kind of prime you to be a little bit more mentally agile like puzzle games, like games like Candy Crush. But there's less evidence for games that are actually effective for what we think of, specially, like, mental health. So fighting depression, anxiety, umm… PTSD things like that. 

00:15:55
NICK FORTUGNO So one example of this umm… that's very prominent that you may have heard of is Lumosity. How many of you ever heard of, heard of Lumosity? Few, used Lumosity? All right, so Lumosity purported to be based on certain kinds of neuro-scientific studies that showed that certain kinds of skill tasks when repeated would improve mental acuity especially in old age, so that you could basically drill an exercise and get better. Umm… they raise millions of dollars invent your capital to promote this product and push it forward and they give you pricing commercials for Lumosity if you think about it like the games had improve your brain. The important thing to take away from Lumosity though is that its research was never very strong, umm… there's very relevance as this work is based on a premise of a previous game called Brain Age that intend to release that was actually debunked thoroughly. And Lumosity was recently sued by the federal government for misrepresenting its claims for two to three million dollars. So… the evidence around this field though there's a lot of interest in neuro-science and games that people pursuing it, this kind of well-being study in mental health and, and mental acuity uh… wasn't very successful for the very research problems that… I think that Melanie mentioned before. 

00:17:05
MELANIE BREWSTER But there are games that do actually have a growing body of research support behind them. So one of them is actually Tetris which is a game that I think most of us probably have, have come in contact with to this point, and there is some work that suggests that visual-spatial games like Tetris, but it doesn't have to be Tetris, it could even be expanded, some people speculated even games like candy Crush could fall into this. Umm… but, these games are useful in disrupting intrusive traumatic memories from being formed after traumatic event occurs. Essentially, what that means is if you play a game like Tetris shortly after experiencing something traumatic, umm… the original window done in this study was four to six hours, but they've expanded that to several days after traumatic event occurs. It helps prevent the occurrence of flashbacks and also lessens the emotional distress that you feel when you reflect on the trauma that occurred umm… which is really, really quite fascinating. And umm… so there have been a number of studies that have actually been published on this. And one of the things that they found is that it could be the eye movement that's involved in playing a game like Tetris. So some of you that are familiar with, with processes like EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization umm… developed by Francine Shapiro, that's a technique where you see a light flashing in front of your eyes, going back and forth and you have to track it. Well, you think about memories that are traumatic for you, so it's used in VAs across the country as a way to umm… combat PTSD symptoms. It could be the games like this umm… tap into the same processes that EMDR does, but we don't necessarily know. But again, a push for that's made um, for integrating these into places like uh… police stations where when somebody is waiting to give a report after traumatic event occurs, maybe they could play Tetris. Potentially for sexual assault response teams, they could have a game boy. It's just we need to know how effective these things are and ways that we could actually integrate them into the work that we do in a clinical work once we have even more research to support it. So many of you, I, I assume you may have not seen this game. Umm… but it was actually developed out of New York and New Jersey, the umm… the VA's here, it's called Family of Heroes. And this is an online role playing game that was developed for veterans and their families where you get to enact different scenarios umm… and engage with kind of these emotionally responsive avatars that are vets essentially coming home after combat. And their displaying science of various umm… psychological problems such as PTSD, some of them report having suicidal thoughts, the avatar depression or a host of umm… of symptoms related to TBIs or Traumatic Brain Injuries. And umm… this was also in collaboration with the Suicide Prevention Resource Center. So what this game purports to do is in less than an hour to really quick umm… activity, you're supposed to learn umm… what to expect when your vet comes home after a war. Umm… you're supposed to be able to identify signs post-deployment stress. Uh… you're supposed to be more well versed that knowing, what to say? How to provide comfort? And you'll also be more aware of services in your community and how to access them. So it expects you do all of those things. And this is a great example of a game that actually did do what it purported to do. So they've been a number of studies published with it where they had people play the game and then they compared into control samples and what they found is that umm… family members who play this game actually reported that they felt much more prepared to recognize signs of post, post-deployment stress and PTSD symptoms. And they also felt more prepared to discuss these symptoms with their loved one, the vet who had returned. So they felt more confident, they felt more comfortable, they felt more able to be there for them in a real way. But what's important is that they'd not only felt more prepared, they actually took more action to confronting their loved ones on their symptoms and encouraging them to get help. So 80% of people roughly after playing the game in the umm… experimental group were able to discuss their concerns with their vet and with their loved one compared to umm… 56% who were in the control group, who, who did also discuss this as well. So if you see, like, about a 20% increased there, which is pretty good. 

00:21:20
NICK FORTUGNO And just as in a side, it's, it's notable that the, the military, the US Military in particular has been very much a sponsor of serious games for a long time for a variety of purposes. Not just umm… a lot of it has been educational in the sense of like teaching people how to use machinery, and weaponry, and vehicles within the military. But there's been a lot of focus on PTSD. And, you know, a lot of games that have been sponsored recently and continue to be sponsored around helping the PSD, PS, PTSD treatment. 

00:21:50
MELANIE BREWSTER Umm… there are also number of uh… games that over bound first person shooters with elderly individuals. 

00:21:55
NICK FORTUGNO Yeah. So, so neuroscientific research around games has been really strong, there's a conference that goes on every year called Neuroscience and Games and escons, there were two different conferences that are now combined, I think in Los Angeles every year. And effectively what they are doing is explaining the way that games could be used as treatments in… you know to sort of build up certain kinds of mental acuity, particularly in populations of the aging. This is one of two really important stage that was done, one was done by, uh… Dr. Ghastly, therapeutic nature about multitasking. You drive a, a, a vehicle while you watch some lights flash in the environment, you have to respond to the vehicle's movement and lights and actually trains you to become a better multitasker at driving. Umm… the other study is, this one by Season Green and Dafny Beblawi and in this, in this game they had uh… people who'd never played first person shooters before play on real tournament and uh… Call of Duty. Umm… largely people who are older, some of the people in their 50s and 60s, they put them through training uh… regimens that were about 10 hours a week for 15 weeks. And then they tested their ability to uh… basically suppress distracters in a, in a cluttered visual environment which is a, which is really important skill towards executive function and towards multitasking. What they found is, not only did that ability to multitask improve among the, among the population that went through the, through the, the game. Umm… and there were two controls that didn't see improvement. One of which played no games and another which played Tetris. So it's quite specifically first person shooters. Not only did they show improvement that de-aged them effectively 20 years in terms of their multitasking ability. That improvement maintained after six months even with no further treatment. And the studies have been replicated multiple times with different games of that type. Now, I think, there's two interesting things that came out of this research. The first is that this showed transference to a diagnostic in lab setting and it had lasting value over months after treatment which is a pretty profound thing for things in neuroscience, you know, typically serious kind of, odd kind of behavior. But, I think the second important thing to the point that Melanie and I have been making is that it was specifically first-person shooters and not just any game. So… it's not only that first person shooters can do it, but there is some characteristic of a first person shooter that is different than a game like Tetris or (inaudible ), in that a first-person shooter can have this effect and those games can't. And there's more of that research going on now, but it's still very small portion of the research in neuroscience. And it's still very little information about exactly what the effects were that where the parts of this were that caused those effects. 

00:24:30
MELANIE BREWSTER Umm… but then there are other games that have less research behind them, but they are actually games that I think both Nick and I to some degree are more interested in. so we're gonna focus a little bit more on games that have arisen from communities in particular communities that are often stigmatized, marginalized, or in general have gone through situations that are uncomfortable to talk about, and such as a loss of a loved one or more sensitive matters like that. Umm… the issue with these games though is that again there isn't a lot of research that has been done. So even though we're gonna present them, we want you to kind of use caution before suggesting them to your clients for reasons that we can talk about a little bit umm… as well. So, has anybody heard of depression quest? So this was a game it got a lot of press umm… probably about a year or two ago now. 

00:25:20
NICK FORTUGNO Two years ago. 

00:25:20
MELANIE BREWSTER Two years ago. And it was uh… created by Zoe Quinn who was one of the, the main kind of targets of the gamer gate outrage in the controversy. Some of you might be familiar with that others you might not be. Umm… but depression quest is an interactive fiction game where you essentially you play somebody a character who's living with depression and it's set up as a twine game. And I realize that might be a new term for some of you, but twine is essentially umm… like, a choose-your-own-adventure format, but for online so you're given a sentence, and then you're given a number of options about how you would like to respond to that sentence, and then that directs you through the game and different branching narratives. 

00:25:55
NICK FORTUGNO So basically the way the game would work is you would read a couple of paragraphs about the life of this person with depression, and then you would be given a number of options that you could pick from and then those options would determine the next steps. What was notable about depression question this format is that as you played your question, question you would see options that were possible, but were unavailable to you. And those options would slowly close down over time as a method of emulating the emotional experience of depression. 

00:26:20
MELANIE BREWSTER So, you would actually witness all of your choices to make your life better start to foreclose around you. In a way that I, I personally found to be very distressing as I was playing it. But, what's interesting is that the creators of this game really imagined that it will be a kind of a useful cathartic experience for people that are depressed to play this. So they feel like they're not alone, they're connected to others. One of the things that they explicitly say is that this game aims to show other sufferers of depression that they're not alone and to illustrate to people who may not understand the depth of the illness what it can do to people. But you have to also wonder if you are in the depths of depression, and you're engaged in this immersive experience that talks about how you shut down relationships with your loved ones, your family. You start failing at your job, could that be triggering in some ways? So, another game that's gotten a lot of press recently umm… is that Dragon Cancer. Some of you might have heard of this, some of you might not have. But, it was developed by a Christian game designer who lost his very young son to cancer. And he kind of created this game as a labor of love to help with his grieving processes and his mourning. And the game really explores feelings of hopelessness that families go through when they're taking their children to get treatment and many treatments fail, and how they process that, and how umm… he, and his wife, and their other children dealt with that. And what's so interesting is that the designer Ryan Greene talked about how he and his wife and their, and his other children didn't necessarily go through the traditional avenues in their mourning process. So they didn't go to grief counseling. Ah…they didn't go to support groups. They didn't necessarily look at these traditional online resources, but the game itself creating it and playing it with how they dealt with their loss. Umm… and that kind of met what they would typically get from these traditional channels of grief. 

00:28:10
I FEEL LIKE A SPY WHENEVER I USE THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM 

00:28:10
MELANIE BREWSTER And then this is a screenshot from the game Dys.4.ia. So umm… Dys.4.ia was created by Anna Anthropy. And I think it's kind of the gold standard of a lot of games that have arisen out of queer communities to deal with identity issues. So just for is an interactive experience where a trans person uh, avatar has a chance to navigate the world and make decisions umm… surrounding their gender identity confirmation procedures, things like, navigating the women's restroom, and seeing what responses from umm… other little avatars in the game they have, umm…decisions around hormones, decisions around talking to doctors, decisions around talking to a therapist and getting treatment. Umm… and it's thought to be very, very affirming for people who identify as trans, because here's a narrative in a game, umm… in a field like, games where you typically don't have any stories about transgender people. So in that way, it can be very affirming. And it also can be educational for cisgender people who know nothing about trans issues to kind of live a day in the life of a trans character. 

00:29:10
NICK FORTUGNO Yeah, if you don't, if you're not familiar with the world of, of what are called Indie games or Independent games, this was one of the most significant games of last four years. Umm… a lot because it released when, when Anna Anthropy, Anna Anthropy released it, this is a flash game. She released it on a site called Newgrounds which is like, a place where you would release sleep free flash games, but Newgrounds is basically filled with 14 year old boys. And so this is not the kind of content you would expect to be released affirmatively in a world of 14 year old boys. But in fact, it was actually quite well receive there. And I think it speaks important to, to the care with which Anna put into this. It also became very controversial, because it's in the games industry, because it's gamyness is very limited like, you don't actually make that many decisions. There's not very much measuring of how well you do. But, I think that's actually interesting, because it speaks to the possibility that we could make things that are like games but not games, and that those could be powerful to that the interactive design that games have invented doesn't have to be only put into the service of this limited model that we think of. We could make things that aren't games that use game-like things for these purposes. But again it goes, it's important to say that like, to the best of my knowledge, there has never been a study of, of how people who identify this way have responded to Dys.4.ia. And there's no research on whether Dys.4.ia is helping anyone in that way, in a formal way. 

00:30:30
MELANIE BREWSTER And the assumption is that it's a, a positive response, but again we don't necessarily know especially, for people that are in different umm… phases of either identity development or connecting with community. This might be really empowering, this also might be potentially distressing if you're, you have to relive a situation of interacting with your therapist in a troubling way through a game. So… another kind of game-like thing, but not exactly game is, umm… the Coming Out Simulator by Nikky Case. And this is another kind of twine based text interaction game where you help a character navigate their coming-out processes and the disclosure process of that. It's intended to be kind of fun for people who have already come out and educational for people who umm… maybe are less familiar with coming processes. So it's two-fold empowering for the community, educational for other people. And then there's a game called Mainichi who I think some of you have played, because we had it at that games expo event that we put on that Jason had played, hey, I like to embarrass him. Umm… so Mainichi was developed by Mattie Brice and it shows a day in the life of a trans person who's currently transitioning and how people respond to her as she kind of walks down the street, how she goes into a cafe, and how decisions about how people respond to her change depending on again what she does, what she says, how she interacts in the world. So this is a depiction of the cafe scene which in some ways, I think, is the most powerful. So in this scene, umm… the character walks up in orders a cup of coffee. And the Barista asks, "Do you want to pay with cash or credit card?" And this is a really pivotal scene for the character because if the character chooses to pay with cash, the Baristas not gonna see the name on the card which we assume as the player is different from her presenting gender. So, if she pays in cash, everything's great. She flirts with a cute boy at the end of the bar. She goes on their way and its fine. If she pays with a card, the Barista reacts her negatively, the boy that she's crushing on the end of the bar, also reacts her negatively, and her day is kind of ruined. So it shows you how these little behaviors that you engage in can really umm… have a very significant role if you identify as trans and I think that can be very op, I opening for people who are assist who play this game for the first time. And when I say cis, I mean cisgender, not transgender. So, here's the quote umm… from Tate who's a writer for Electro Bureau. And Electro Bureau is kind of like, a clear online gene game resource. I don't know it's a conglomerate. You have to look at it's really interesting. Umm…but he writes that as an out and proud gamer, which, which isn't always that, it isn't always the easy. And the gaming community isn't really rolling in gay characters, but he hopes in some way that you can connect to underrepresented gaming communities and inform everybody else on the processes they go through. And he writes that, he thinks the best way to talk about the, the community is to talk about how these games make you feel. Umm… so games from queer spaces and in queer communities are really seen as a point of connection, umm… building emotional connections, umm… sharing resources with each other, and really having a diverse way to talk about experiences that aren't typically umm… experienced by all team players. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
MELANIE BREWSTER So from these lines, these community based games have a number of different purposes. In one form, they're kind of to counter minority stressors who have a, a place where you can kind of play out your experiences of stigma discrimination of marginalization in a safe contained environment, also to show awareness and potentially build empathy for people who haven't experienced these same, these same stressors, and there's also potentially a social justice piece, because again if you build awareness in people, maybe they'll be motivated to take action and change things. But we have to umm… realize that we don't necessarily know if these games work in those ways. They might be harmful. They might be triggering. We, we hope they're not, but we need research that actually supports that these games are building community, our building connections, or being a positive force in people's live as well. 

00:34:45
NICK FORTUGNO So an example of a game that I, we both think there's a very good job of, of speaking to these issues and being well researched and tested to make sure that it has the effects in intensity with the game called Buffalo. Buffalo was developed by Tiltfactor which is a lab out of Dartmouth led by Mary Flanagan. Mary Flanagan is a very well known figure in the game industry for being an early proponent of, of serious games but particularly serious games backed by research. She wrote a book called "Critical Play," which was one of the early and really most important books about how games could be part of an art culture and be part of a broader culture than just a game of community. Now, Buffalo is a pretty simple game. Tiltfactor makes games that are designed to be commercially released. You can buy Tiltfactor, it is not in print right now at least I, when I checked a few days ago, it was out of print. But I'm sure, it will be re-released. And you can probably contact Mary directly to get information on the game. So the game is a pretty simple umm… structure, effectively what happens is you have two decks of cards, one of which represents a kind of modifier, and the other represents a role that a person could serve. And you play out two of those cards and then the room has to name some, someone that represents those cards either historic or fictional. And if you do, you get a point for that. But you can't ever name the same person twice. And if no one can name that person, someone can call out Buffalo which is to sort of move you could make the dodge and something you can't name. And after a certain number of Buffalo, there's a penalty. And the game changes. So… 

00:36:15
MELANIE BREWSTER And sometimes, they're really easy like, this one. You see… 

00:36:15
NICK FORTUGNO Yeah. So for example, we could just, just try, just try to solve this for yourself. Can you think of a British wizard? Harry Potter, easy example. Anybody else? Get here to find it… 

00:36:30
MELANIE BREWSTER It is ganged of British? I don't know. 

00:36:30
NICK FORTUGNO I don't know, I don't think so. Or you could go through the list of Harry Potter. Right, like, just basically everybody in Harry Potter could do it. Cool! So but what's really interesting is that as part of the design of Tiltfactor Mary brought in experts to study the results of Tiltfactor. So Tiltfactor's development was actually done simultaneously with researchers into basically these kind of, go back, into these kind of, umm… uh… the pro-social causes. And so as the game was being developed, researchers were involved in the process of testing the game. And so the game was developed specifically in the direction that it would have the effect it intended to have which we'll get to in a moment. I think what's really important to mention about Tiltfactor is that all of Tiltfactors games are built this way. And Mary Flanagan has been very public about the fact that certain games that she's made, she's, she's effectively eliminated from the development process. Because, they fail to have the effects she wanted to have. So the idea behind the studio sort of exemplifies the best aspects of what impact games could look like. Game development that's really focused on commercializable and fun activities that could be distributed to a wide audience, but that are rigorous in the way they've been tested so that we know that there are effects are real. And so the games that Tiltfactor makes releases, we know have certain kinds of benefits to well-being, because they've been tested by experts to demonstrate them. So what is the effect that Buffalo has? Well, we saw an easy example. Let's take a more controversial example, can you think of a multiracial superhero? I'm sorry. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Miles Morales. 

00:38:05
NICK FORTUGNO Miles Morales? Who is Miles Morales? 

00:38:10
[sil.] 

00:38:15
NICK FORTUGNO Right. So we have, I have half black version of spider-man. How many people knew that existed? A handful… 

00:38:20
MELANIE BREWSTER Yeah, selective audience. 

00:38:25
NICK FORTUGNO …I think, I can see the Venn, the Venn diagram of gamers and people who knew that I probably is pretty tight. 

00:38:25
MELANIE BREWSTER There's another example umm… in the same card deck that you'll come up with its female physicist. 

00:38:35
NICK FORTUGNO Yeah, that's a good one, anybody, anybody non-query answer, anybody? 

00:38:45
MELANIE BREWSTER So we no one. I'm sure there's more than one. (inaudible ) she's an astronaut maybe. Yeah. And then uh… what about Asian descent and politician? 

00:39:00
[sil.] 

00:39:05
MELANIE BREWSTER In, in the US? 

00:39:05
NICK FORTUGNO Oh, yeah. 

00:39:10
MELANIE BREWSTER Bobby Jindal. 

00:39:10
NICK FORTUGNO Oh, yeah, and in the comptroller, oh, yeah. yeah, our comptroller 

00:39:10
MELANIE BREWSTER Right. 

00:39:15
NICK FORTUGNO Right, and that's, that's the point, right? Is that we're suddenly faced with this, and we realize that we don't know this and why don't we know this and then the game becomes a conversation point to give you that information. And so obviously, this is based in the sort of thinking about, you know, sort of minority representation issues that have to do with, well, can you think, when you think of a physicist, do you think of a woman, right? Like and, and the answer is if you don't have an answer, no, you don't, because you can't think of a physicist. But by playing this game, you can think of a physicist, because you are introduced to female physicists. And so the idea behind playing the game is to effectively expose people to histories and, and sort of like, representational clusters that they're not normally accustomed to. So by becoming expert in this game, and this is where I think Buffalo is brilliant. When you become experts at this game, it's because you can match all of these modifiers to all of these terms. So the terms have become more flexible. You can immediately name any type of physicist that you asked for regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or origin. And so physicist isn't a charged word anymore. It's become flexible the way we intend it to be in a more equal world. 

00:40:25
MELANIE BREWSTER And I think Mary's work really represents. Umm… what we need to move towards in terms of research, so here's a game that as diversity educators people that may go on to teach multicultural classes. We could even bring into our classrooms and we know it works because there's numerous studies that have supported it. And we would like that for all games that we provide as resources either to our client so that we bring into our classrooms, but we don't really have that at this moment. 

00:40:50
NICK FORTUGNO So as we think about what it would mean to develop games that could relate to well being, there's sort of a few principles that we think are critical. Umm…the first is that they have to be coupled with, with research that, that when game designers go off and do this on their own, we're groping in the dark and hoping that things work, and in the, in the worst possible ways that can actually be triggering or damaging for people. So it's critical that we have access to research, research and a number of game designers who are working the space are more and more actively interested in partnering with researchers and clinicians to find things that can be tested and verified. 

00:41:25
MELANIE BREWSTER Umm… the other thing is really when you're seeing clients, and you know, they play games, ask them what they're playing, ask them a role those games have in their life. I've talked to many people that are playing games on the subway, because they fly on the subway agitating, they feel like, it's claustrophobic. It's a way to avoid talking to people, but people use games instrumentally already. So, we need to be having those conversations in clinical settings so we understand them more. Umm… also you need to play games yourself before you recommend a game to your client. See how they sit with you, see how much time you spend on them, what mechanics you like or ones you don't like, how accessible they are. 

00:42:00
NICK FORTUGNO And then finally, you know, not all of this, you know, I, I, we were in really interesting moment in history where in particular LGBTQ, LGBTQ communities have just been very interested in expressing themselves through games. And so the, the Indie Community has been a very strong proponent of sort of the exploration of identity and media as a result of that but there's no reason why game developers have to lead that. And there are people with expertise in the fields of psychology and sociology who could come forward with that information themselves and actually have games made through those purposes. And so this is happening more and more as different grant structures enabled by the government are turning towards media. You're starting to see organizations like, the NIH fun more of these kinds of sources and partnerships between game developers and researchers are becoming more common. But I encourage you that if there's something that you think a game could solve, there are resources and developers out there who will be interested in helping you do that. 

00:42:50
MELANIE BREWSTER I think that's about it. I know, we have probably five minutes for questions, and I can pass around the mic if you have anything. But thank you. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN I'm, I'm really happy to see this connection, now especially with you 'cause I've actually worked with Nick for two, we've we, we worked with Skateboarders for a couple of years. And we're gonna do it again, but umm… it's exciting doing game design project digital media stuff with them. But it just, this is really making the connection between My Candy Crush addiction which I think I use, you all talk about as a game that was designed for 40 year old women. And I remember you saying that and being like, "Oh, my God, it totally is." But, and I worry about the addictive side of games because of that because I certainly feel sometimes addicted to the games I play, and I think sometimes, I'm, I know I'm using them and I realize now that I'm using them, when I start to feel overwhelmed, and I just want to shut it all out. But sometimes, you kind of like, habitually play them when you need to also engage back with it. And it starts to become worse, you know, that sort of avoidant thing. But it makes me think also about how the skateboarders that I work with, I know that they skateboard most of them because the skateboard, the act of skateboarding is a treatment for like, most everything that the ADHD, dyslexia uh… you know, or it develops skills that they're better at because it's like, you know, the deficit of the dyslexia has an upside which is their visual spatial whatever it is. You know, so I, I just think, it's making me think about how we might work with our skateboarders who design games that are treating this stuff. Because they, you know, in the winter, they're losing their minds because they can't skateboard, because it literally treats their depression, their anxiety, everything else, so anyway nice. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN I'm so happy to see you again. 

00:44:35
NICK FORTUGNO It's good to see you too. And yeah, I think that, I mean, you know, you know, mentally talked a little bit about this sort of like self medicate approach. And I think there is something, there are things about diction that there are not. They're not, it's not pointless thing to talk about. I mean that there is, there are places where certain kind of behavioral techniques are quite literally used in games and quite literally lifted from sort of Skinner like research for the purpose of keeping people attached to games. And I think there are very open questions in the game industry right now about how far we can go with that before we start to cross ethical lines. But I, I, I also think that it would be like fears of that need to be diminished, because of just the sheer volume of people who use these things successfully. 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN So I have a question. Umm… because it's not as obvious to me about like, where to find the good games and how to select them? I guess, this is more from like parenting. My children are always like, "Oh, we want this educational or we want a game about math or social studies." And I feel like as I'm searching the App Store's, it's overwhelming. Some of the games will choose and it, you know, do I pay for it, and then the ads are strange. May, maybe this is obvious to everyone would I feel like even for someone I feel like I'm pretty good with text stuff to an extent. But like, even when I Google, I feel like a lot of stuff is still a driven us to like what certain sites are recommending as far as games. So I guess again, this is more from a parenting side than psychology. But do you have any recommendations for sorting out like, the good types of games versus out, there's, there's so much out there. 

00:46:15
NICK FORTUGNO Yeah, I mean, games have a really pitiful press. We didn't to say to the people in the games press are pitiful. There are very, very smart writers in the games press, but the industry of game press is pitiful compared to something like movies and television. Like, if you want to find a good children's television show, it is very easy to do. There are like, assemblies of media presentation that will handle that for you. Games don't have that. Particularly, games on mobile really don't have it. And part of the problem is what we talked about at the very beginning is that because gamer as a term is still conceived by almost everybody including industry people as being 18 to 34, 35 year old men who play games on an Xbox or play station, that is where the only real advertising is in terms of mass market advertising is where the only real presses in terms of a critical press enterprise. And so it's very hard to find these things. Now in the case of educated, for casual games like, general games on your iPhone, it's basically a just up free-for-all. You have to get word of mouth that's typically how games circulate. I honestly, it's the best recommendation I can give you is find people who talk intelligently about games on Twitter and follow them, right? That's like probably the best way to do it. Education is slightly different. A lot of educational games get passed around by word of mouth through teachers. So teachers will go to teachers conferences and talk to other teachers about the games they use and that's how they circulate. There are a few places you can look for games that have actually been verified. The Department of Ed, funds a lot more games than they used to. And like, two years ago, I was told that they gave out 16 SBIRS or 17 I can't remember and 13 of them were games. And all of those things have been researched, because at, Ed wouldn't let, they'll go out without research. But also there are a few intermediary organizations like, Amplify and BrainPOP that are aggregators for some of these games. And they typically go through avoiding process to allow the games onto their site. So games on BrainPOP are usually pretty safe. And they're also structured into umm… grade levels and subject matter. So you can actually find very specific things you're looking for. But I, I wanna warn you this is a very nascent industry like, a lot of these, a lot of this groundwork hasn't been laid yet. And so… the homework that you feel like you're doing is not that you're doing anything wrong. It's just a hard space to find paths through. 

00:48:25
[sil.] 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN I just wanted to say that there's a website called Common Sense Media. And umm… it does review games in addition to all sorts of movies, and television show, and stuff, and it'll umm… provide like, an overview of what they are, umm… and who the target audience is, and it rates it. Umm… I have four kids and umm… in school. Our tech guy presented that and it seemed to be, you know, because parents sort of don't know what they don't know. And it's really helpful tool just to sort of see what your kids are on and to see if it's kind of PG or not. 

00:49:00
NICK FORTUGNO Yeah, if you're interested in Indie games like what's like sort of what's at the edge of Indie games, which, I think, has relevance to this, because many independent games are either identity focused or tied to serious causes at least in an artistic way not so much like a researcher doing work on the history of the Iranian Revolution, but someone whose descendants who was from Iran and whose parents fight the Iranian Revolution making a game about their biography kind of stuff. Umm…if you look at sites like, Rock Paper Shotgun, if you look at conferences like, indicate, you can find resources to point you in these directions. But like I said, games are still very much spread by word of mouth. So just like paying attention to the game community and starting to follow some of the really important people in it which are not hard to find if you start poking around Twitter. That's probably the best way to stay in touch with the forum, the whole forum. 

00:49:50
MELANIE BREWSTER I think, we're actually at time umm… but we'll stick around for a few minutes if you have any other questions or anything like that. 

00:49:55
