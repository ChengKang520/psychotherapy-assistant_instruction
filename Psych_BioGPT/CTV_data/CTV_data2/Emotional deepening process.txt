Emotional deepening process 

00:00:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Recent development in EFT is the uh… formulation of model or sequence of emotional deepening uh… processes. And umm… this is uh… an attempt to integrate some of the complexity of EFT. But the ideas basically that when we work when a client comes to see us they often they presented a kind of regular sequence uh… that we can follow with the client. It provides a kind of road map umm… that runs across many kinds, many different kinds of EFT work. And this sequence starts with uh… the person presenting, the client presenting with an undifferentiated emotion. This is an emotion which is global and umm… not distinctive or specific uh… so uh… the client might say I feel bad or I feel frustrated or I don't know what I feel. So that's an undifferentiated emotion state that means there is no distinctions this kind of global feeling of badness. And the therapist helps the client to specify and differentiate sort out the different what kind of bad it is that they feel? And so that it moves to uh… slightly deeper kind of emotion uh… response and that's typically a "secondary reactive emotion". That's an emotion which is a reaction to another emotion that came before it. And this "secondary process" is also often the symptoms the client bring to therapy you know, whether they're depressed or anxious or umm… having "post trauma" difficulties or, or what have you so? The presenting problems that clients bring their symptoms are often "secondary reactive emotions". And umm… these are emotions don't help them deal with their situations and they tend to get stuck and then go round and round circles. Umm… and so uh… the therapist gives the, gives this emotion the "secondary emotion empathy". They offered empathy uh… because in EFT you cannot leave an emotion before you write about it even if it's "secondary reactive emotion". So gets empathy in but the therapists listening and helping the client listen to what's underneath? Or what came before this "symptom manic emotion" uh… so client might come to me with social anxiety or something which is a "secondary reactive emotion" umm… and umm… so then the therapists incline begin to listen to what came before that presenting "secondary emotion" and that will typically go to it could be another "secondary emotion" that something else comes before or it could be a "primary maladaptive emotion" that's an emotion umm… which is an old bad stuck emotion which doesn't fit the situation anymore and the persons overreacting to. So these "primary maladaptive emotions" people also get stuck and they go round and round in circles. And umm… so you know with some of the social anxiety that would be a sense of shame or defectiveness or shame about their defectiveness and then the "secondary emotion is going to be the fear of the shame uh… becomes after that so then we were working with this, this "primary maladaptive and emotion which is the client first reaction to a situation and so nothing came before it umm… but it's more about things that'll happen to the person in the past. So it's an old bad familiar feeling that no longer fits the current situation and so it's not useful to them. And people do get stuck in these and so the therapists incline work with this again the client has to write this emotion fully experienced the sense of shame or brokenness for example in the case of "social anxiety" umm… .and then there's a kind of deepening process uh… and umm… one of the reason part of this emerging model and EFT is the idea that we help the client to identify in the "primary maladaptive emotion" that called "pain" that's the thing that hurts the most. That the thing at the deepest level feels most painful or difficult for them that they struggle within its often a sense of being broken, a sense of being lost and lonely and abundant uh… feeling unlovable uh… and this, this, prime this core pain umm… then umm… what we do in EFT therapies we didn't say what is that pain need? What is that pain need? Umm… so remember you know I've been talking about how uh… part of the value of emotions as they point to needs or wants and then needs (inaudible ) point to other things umm… so with the core pain we say what is this sense of brokenness or this lost lonely child part of you or the sense of being so defective? What is this need? And the client then says the client sort of the bottom of the process here and the client says "Well you know I just need some one to be there to validate me, I need someone to protect me from harm or any you know my socially anxious clients as often I just need someone to acknowledge and look at me be able to look at me in a face of acknowledge might existence and so the core pain has, has these un met needs associated with it and as the client begins to access the core pain and the unmet needs that they point to we then say "okay, so what would be that need?" and the thing that would meet that need is a different emotion. So with the sense un… of being exposed and vulnerable uh… would be "protective anger" with the sense of being unlovable and alone and abundant that would be compassion or love umm… and so there's another emotion umm… that's implicit in the unmet need that comes out of the core pain. And so what happens is the client basically bridges from the "primary maladaptive emotion" to an "adaptive emotion" through this the unmet need associated for core pain and we have a kind of set of kind of slogans so we say you know uh… "the primary adaptive emotions" that were helping our clients to access in therapy tend to be uh… protective anger that's the anger that protects umm… that's uh… uh… uh… connecting a sadness so that's the sadness that connects umm… that's like with my socially anxious clients that's the hunger for human contact. And that sadness of missing out on being with other people and being close to other people. So we have this umm… it's a "protective anger" particularly used for "trauma", we have protective sadness uh… sorry connecting sadness uh… that's more for say something like social anxiety or depression with sadness that connects umm… and then there's compare self, self compassion um… we often help the client access a part of them that uh… loves and cares and protects and supports the (inaudible ) feelings so wounded and injured so we help the client in accessing themselves these self compassion and that's how compassion is going to transform that stuck "primary maladaptive emotion" and there are other emotions too there is love, there is curiosity, there is humor, and these different emotions umm… are all emotions that we help our clients to access their primary adaptive emotions that fit the current situation and they help the client to transform uh… the "primary maladaptive emotion."
