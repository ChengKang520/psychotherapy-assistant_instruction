Dr. Gabor Mate, MD

GABOR MATE Hi, my name is Dr. Gabor Mate. I'm speaking to you from Vancouver, British Colombia, and wherever you are, I wish you a good day. I'll be speaking to you today about addictions, and I'll tell you a little bit about my work in a moment. The talk I'm giving you today, the information I'll be giving you, I imagine will raise a lot of questions for many of you, and I trust will perhaps answer many of those questions as well. The information is based on the research I did for my work on my book in the "The Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction," which I encourage you to look at if that's of interest to you. And if you have any questions based on anything I've said during this presentation, please feel free to write me at my website, www.drgabormate.com. So, as I said I'm a physician in Vancouver, British Columbia, much of my work was in family practice for 20 years. For 7 years, I did palliative care work and for the last 14 years of my medical work, I was employed in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, which is internationally known as North America's most concentrated area of drug use. And that means that in a few square block radius, we have thousands of people dependent on injected, inhaled or injected substances such as, heroine, cocaine, crystal meth, marijuana, alcohol, nicotine of course, and almost whatever other drug is available. Even from people visiting in numbers from places like the inner ghettos in the United States, it is surprising to go off streets of the Downtown Eastside to see this open air drug market, to see people clearly in the throws of the drug experience, injecting sometimes outdoors in the back alleys and so on. And it's surprising and sometimes crushing for people to see the sadness and suffering that they witness. So that's where my clinic was and I may say more about that work later on. I will begin this talk by reading a little bit from the second chapter of my book in the "Realm of Hungry Ghosts." And the second chapter is entitled, "The Lethal Hold of Drugs." The epigraph to the chapter, and this is something you would have witnessed in your work, is from the beautifully written Cairo Trilogy by the Noble Prize winning Egyptian author, Naguib Mahfouz, who wrote, "Nothing records the effects of a sad life so graphically as the human body." Now in the second chapter, I being with the funeral of a patient of mine, and as those of you who work in the addiction field will know, sometimes our patients succumb and in the case of my work in the Downtown Eastside, people died not infrequently of multiple causes of HIV, of Hepatitis C and its complications, of infections of the heart valves, the brain, septicemia, which is a massive infection of the bloodstream, of suicide, of violence and, of course, of overdose, which is the case of this patient who's name was Shannon, and the scene begins at the funereal home where she's being memorialized having died of an overdose. "From behind his lectern at an East Hastings Funeral Chapel, the elderly priest proclaims the world's farewell to Shannon. 'How exuberant and joyful she was. Here I am, Sha-na-na! she announced as she burst into a room. On seeing her, who could not feel glad to be alive?' The young Shannon, I've been told, was model beautiful. Hints of that beauty still remained when I met her six years ago, traces gradually erased by her increasingly pallid complexion, sunken cheekbones and decaying teeth. In her last years, Shannon was often in pain." And then I described the medical illnesses and the suffering that she endured due to HIV, due to bone infections that never healed, due to skin infections that because of repeated injections remained ulcerated and painful. I will not describe all the details. I'll jump ahead to after the funeral.

NARRATOR "I look at this small cluster of human beings gathered at the funeral of a comrade who met her death in her mid 30s. How powerful the addiction, I think, that not all the physical disease and pain and psychological torment can shake loose its lethal hold on their souls. Nothing sways them from their habit, not illness, not the sacrifice of love and relationship, not the loss of all earthly goods, not the crushing of their dignity, not the fear of dying. The drive is that relentless. How to understand the death grip of drug addiction?" What keeps this patient injecting despite hip abscesses, despite HIV, despite Hepatitis C, despite all the negative consequences. And of course, that's one of the myths around drug addiction, of which there are many, that people need negative consequences, you know, to uh, have the impetus to heal. Well, if living in a Downtown Eastside of Vancouver with HIV, outside the law, having lost everything in life is not a negative consequence, I don't know what that is. But that does not induce people to give it up. It's something very powerful about addiction that keeps them enslaved, and what is that? And I'm sure that's a question that those of the people listening today, who have worked in addictions have often asked themselves. What is that have… What would it take people to recognize that what they're doing is self-murder and why can't they give it up? Now, if you look at the North American answer to that question, it's basically two-fold. By and large, the answer that society gives to the dilemma of drug addiction is that what it is, it's the matter of choice. People are choosing to be addicted, people are choosing to use drugs, people are choosing a lifestyle that has multiple negative consequences for them. And out of that idea, that it's an individual and personal choice, comes the approach that addictions have to be, A, discouraged and, B, punished, because if it is a matter of individual choice, then what can we actually do? Well, I begin to deter people. How did you deter people? By draconian punishments, enhance the so-called war drugs, I say "so-called" because the case I'll be making for you is that there is no war on drugs. You can't make war on inanimate objects, what that actually is, is a war on drug addicts. Nevertheless, the justification for the highly punitive legal approach to substance use is based on the principle that it is a matter of choice and people need to be dissuaded from it, by whatever means possible. Incidentally, this is also how we by and large practice child rearing, and most parenting advice from the so-called experts on parenting tells parents that the way you bring up children who are socialized and well-behaved is that you punish them for negative behaviors and you award them for good behaviors. The theoretical bases for this approach comes from the behavioral school of psychology, which is concerned not with the dynamics and the causes of behaviors, but simply with manifestation of behaviors and how to control behaviors. Hence, in a laboratory, if you wish to control the behavior of a rat, you'll punish them or hurt them for behavior you don't want. For example, you can keep them from orientating towards a certain part of a cage by infusing electricity into the wire so the rat gets a shock when he goes there, or on other hand, if you want him to gravitate towards the other end of the cage, you'll put a sugar cube there. And so, the simple measure of reward and punishment will keep the rat behaving exactly the way you want him to behave. However, you're not concerned about what is motivating the rat, you're not concerned about the rat's experience, and least of all you're concerned with the suffering that you're imposing on the rat to get him to behave in certain ways, but this behavioral approach, which again is focused on behaviors rather than the dynamics of behaviors, is what's dominant in North American education and North American child rearing, and it's what underlies our approach for the most part to drug use. Now, the other approach, the other understanding of drug addiction is the mainstream medical view, which is that addiction is a biological disease. This is the view which underlies the definition of addiction by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, which in its short definition says, "Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of the brain, reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry." And then, they describe many of the behavioral features of the addiction and many of the emotional dysfunctions on addiction, and these descriptions are quite accurate really, but the primary assumption is that we are dealing with a primary brain disease, in other words, addiction arises out of biological call causes, uh, rooted in the brain. Now, the… this biological view addiction, the diseases model of addiction, which is also embraced by the… broadly speaking, the 12-step movement, is of course is much more humane than the approach that reduces it to personal choices. At least, if somebody has got a brain disease, you don't punish people for having a disease, you don't punish people with kidney disease, for having kidney disease, and therefore you shouldn't punish people either with brain disease for having a disease of the brain. When you look at the sources of this biological disease, so considered, the American Society of Addiction Medicine says that up to 50 percent of the predisposition of people to addiction is based on genetics. In other words, it's a matter of inheritance. And that again is more human and more humane because you again, you don't blame people for having inherited or for that matter having passed on certain genes. It's simply a matter of biological or genetic bad luck, if you will. And so, hence the idea which for my mind is another myth that certain people like certain ethnic groups are more likely to be addicted because they're biologically more prone to it by dent of heredity. And so, some people will argue, for example, that if you look at the North American aboriginal population, the American Native Indian, if you will, uh, these people are at a disadvantage 'cause they can't handle alcohol and other drugs like the way Caucasians can purely for genetic reasons. And this explains why they're so much more prone, uh, statically to be addicted than the Caucasian population. Now again this approach is certainly more humane also of course opens up the possibility of treatment, because if something is a brain disease then I can hear the disease, and any other organic disease of the body, whether it's heart disease, intestinal disease or a disease of the nervous system, you're gonna treat it, and you want more time, you're not gonna punish people for having the disease. So, while the two approaches of the choice behavioral model on the hand and the biological disease model on the other, seem very, very different and in significant ways of course they are. They do share something in common, and what they share in common is very powerful. What they share in common is that they both allow us, by and large, to ignore what actually happened to the individual through the course of their lives. It's either a choice they made because they are stupid or morally weak, or something they inherited for the most part. But what was the trajectory of their development? What environment were they born into? What happened to them in life? What difficulty, stresses, perhaps traumas did they endure during their formative years, that is by and large left out of the equation. Now, it is true to say that the American Society of Addiction Medicine's definition does allow for these other factors, like it will allow cultural factors, it will allow stresses in the family of origin, and as a fifth alternative influence, it even talks about trauma. But the emphasis still is on the biology and that biology is for the most part conditioned in their view by genetics. I believe that this prospective leaves us far sure of understanding what addictions are all about. And I'll be at least outlining for you some of the science behind my contention that addiction, while it may have a genetic component, probably does have at least in some or many cases, a background of genetic predisposition, it is not genetically determined, and as matter of fact, genes play a rather small role in deciding who's gonna be addicted and who will not be addicted. And that in fact, the idea that addictions are on one hand either choices or on the other hand genetically determined biological pathways leaves something very essential out of our understanding of addiction, which is again, what is it that happened to human beings? And more importantly, what are the social, historical, economic and cultural conditions that foster addictions in large groups, in certain minority groups and in people in general. In other words, the genetic prospective is not simply an innocent scientific point of view, it has a social role to play. And the social role it plays is that it allows us to take the emphasis and the focus off what happens in a society, what conditions, what social relationships, what factors, what social policies promote, or perhaps, inhabit addictions. And the genetic perspective, without meaning to necessarily, but ends up as a kind of justification for social circumstances that are actually harmful to people's lives. As Louis Menand, a regular contributor to the New Yorker magazine said, "It's all in the genes is an explanations for the way things are that does not threaten the way things are. Why should someone feel unhappy or engage in anti-social behavior when that person is living in the freest and most prosperous nation on earth? It can't be the system, there must be a flaw in the wiring somewhere." In other words, I am advocating a point of view that takes into account cultural, social, economic effects as they impact individual families over generations. And so I regard addiction as a multi-generational manifestation of economic, social, physiological, and cultural and even spiritual dynamics refracted through the multi-generation of family as it affects the families of origin and as life in those families of origin then affects the development of individuals including, as I'll be telling you, the biological brain development of individuals. Now, this simply means that human beings are not discreet entities. They're in fact the product of a particular environment, that is, physiological, social and biological products of a certain environment. This view from the modern scientific prospective has been called a biopsychosocial perspective, which is to say that the biology of individuals can't be separated from their physiological and social relationships. And this is true from conception until death. And I can give you a couple of very straightforward examples of that, not from the addiction field but simply to illustrate for you what it means to have a biopsychosocial perspective. So we know from many studies that children whose parents are stressed are more likely do have asthma. Now, it's also true that the more you live in a polluted area or the more polluted the areas where you live, again, the more likely you are to have asthma. And in polluted areas, it's been shown in a number of studies, that the more stressed the parents are, the more likely the kids are gonna have asthma. Now, we can clearly understand the role of pollution in triggering irritation of the airways. How do we understand the role of the parents and parental stress? Very simple, the way we treat asthma, and I'm not gonna go into a long explanation of it, is basically with two hormones, adrenaline and cortisol or their artificial analogs. And adrenaline and cortisol are the stress hormones. Stress is reduced… sorry, stress induces the release of cortisol and adrenaline, adrenaline, uh, helps us escape and fight, uh, danger. In the case of the lungs, it also opens up the airways so we have more airflow. Cortisol, in the short term, in terms of stress, gives us more sugar, more blood sugar so we have more energy to fight and to escape. It also reduces inflammation, and what happens in asthma is your narrowing of the airways and inflammation of the airways. So stress hormones reduce the inflammation and open up the airways, which is why we give them as meditations to asthmatics. Now, what happens to children whose parents are stressed? When the parents are stressed, the children are stressed, chronically. There stress response mechanism become impaired and now we have to give them extra stress hormones to keep their airways open. In other words, the asthma is a biopsychosocial event which in part is induced by emotional stress. And what creates stress for the parents? Well, many, many social factors, economic, cultural, ethnic and so on. In other words, the child's asthma is a reflection of social conditions as well as perhaps, of course, of individual genetic predisposition. So we're not dismissing genetics, what we're saying is that genetics do not predetermine, they're predisposed, but they do not predetermine. This is a biopsychosocial perspective, which also means when it comes to dealing with asthma, we need to be talking about stress. Another example of what we call biopsychosocial perspective is at the end of life, as a study in the Neuman Journal of Medicine showed some years ago, couples, elderly couples are so wedded together in their biology, which is again conditioned by their psychology and emotional lives, is that when one of them is hospitalized, the other one is much more likely to die. In other words, the cardiovascular, neurological, immunological and hormonal apparatus of one individual is conditioned and even supported by the psychological, social, emotional relationship with other human beings. Again, by simply a biopsychosocial perspective, this is hardily controversial, in fact, I would argue that it's not in the least controversial for the scientific point of view. My criticism, if you will, of my own profession, a medical profession, is that the phrase that we often employ, which is evidence-based practice, we don't actually pursue, because the evidence is not for a separation of mind and body, it's not for separation of the individual from the environment, but actually foreseeing the unity of the individual and the environment and how the one impacts the other. So I only wish that we had evidence-based practice. Nor is this is a new prospective, this has been the spiritual and philosophical prospective of many traditions for thousands of years. What's happened now is that modern science has validated it, but despite that validation it's not how we practice. So allow me to read you a quote here from the Buddha, who said 2,500 years ago, "Contemplate the nature of independent core rising during every moment. When you look at a leaf or a raindrop, meditate on all the conditions near and distant that have contributed to the presence of that leaf or raindrop. Know that the world is woven of interconnected threads, this is because that is, this is not because that is not. This is born because that is born, this dies because that dies. The leaf contains the sun, the earth and the sky," photosynthesis, minerals and water. "The birth and death of any phenomena are connected to the birth and death of all other phenomena. The one contains the many and the many contains the one. Without the one, there cannot be the many and without the many, there cannot be the one." That broad perspective then, which has been articulated by a number of traditions again and now validated by modern science, is the one that we're going to apply when it comes to talking about addictions. So at this point, what we might wish to do is to define addiction. So I'll give you my definition of addiction. It's not really that far from the American Society of Addiction Medicine's definition, although again the sources of addiction I see is very different from the way they seem to perceive it. So addiction is a dynamic, a biological, social, emotional, psychological, spiritual dynamic that results in behaviors that are manifested by a compulsive engagement with the behavior, a preoccupation with it, number one. Number two, impaired control over that behavior, the person can't stop it, even may I know it's bad for them, and they continue to relapse even though they have made promises to themselves or to others to discontinue, so impaired control is the second characteristic. Third, persistence or relapse despite evidence of harm, number four, dissatisfaction, irritability or intense craving when the object, be that drug or other goal, is not immediately available. So I would also add that with the addictive of behavior, there… at least at the beginning and even over the long term, there is often a sense of pleasure and relief when the behavior is engaged in. Of course, that doesn't stop long-term depression, emotional loss, despair and so on, but there is an immediate sense of relief. As you can see, the addiction definition is very close to that of obsessive compulsive disorder, which is again is a set of behaviors that have negative consequences, that the person can't stop despite those negative consequences, the difference being is that the person with OCD does not crave and does not really find pleasure in the behaviors. They're compelled to engage in them, but there's not that sense of looking forward and pleasure that addiction affords, otherwise, they're really quite similar. As I said, uh, the models of addiction, where predominant, are those of choice and those of biological disease. And one more time, I'm going to advocate here for a biopsychosocial approach. Now, of course, people sometimes talk about… I want to notice a couple of things about my definition. First of all, people often talk about so-called good addictions. Well, by my, my… by my definition, excuse me, there are no good addictions. If you look at the very word "addiction" and it's etymological roots, it comes from the Latin word "addictus" and an addictus was somebody who owed somebody else money and couldn't pay them back and they were assigned as a slave to that person. So addiction actually come from the word "slavery," so to say "are there good addictions" is like saying, "is there good slavery". Well, there is no good slavery. Sometimes, people confuse passions with addictions, there are good passions, there are no addictions. The difference is the impaired control over the behavior. If you're compelled to do it despite negative consequences, you cannot talk about a good addiction, and that's what addiction is. So for example, let us take two people who are jogging in the street. One of them is an exercise… adept who is engaging in exercise purely for health reasons. They feel slimmer, they're more energetic, they sleep better, they're healthier when they exercise, so they're jogging down the street. There's another person jogging down the street who may derive all those benefits that the first one derives from the exercise, but they're also an addict. What is a… How can you be an exercise addict? Well, what if you're engaging in the behavior despite negative consequences? For example, you keep hurting yourself because you over exercise, or you're using exercise to get away from a sense of deficient emptiness that you experience, and rather than working on what makes you feel so empty and makes you feel so anxious, you exercise instead so that you're actually maintaining your psychological states by exercising, 'cause you're not dealing with them. What if you exercise to the detriment of your social or intimate personal relationships? You see that all these negative impacts of injury, loss of relationship, loss of personal, emotional balance, would define the prediction as addictive, which is to say it's not the external behavior that defines the addiction for that most part, but the internal relationship to it. That's the first point, the second point is notice that my definition of addiction although includes drugs, and by the way this is also true, let's admit it, of the American Society of Addiction Medicine's definition, it's not restricted to drugs. You can be addicted, obviously, to food, to exercises, as I have just said, you can be addicted to work, you can be addicted to sex, to gambling, to video games, to the Internet, to pornography, to whole set of external behaviors and targets. Again, it's not so much the external activity that defines the addiction but the internal relationship to it. You can look at two people playing cards. One of them could be doing it as a social exercise, as a way of relaxation, as an entertainment, and the other could be completely addicted. One can watch, play a video game out of pure fun, pleasure, or you can be completely addicted to it. So, again, it's the internal relationship to it. And at this point, I also have to say that it's even possible to use drugs in a non-addictive way. I'm not advocating the use of drugs. I personally… feel that… if anything, that the use of drugs is always questionable, but clearly, some people can use substances without meeting the definition of addiction. In other words, they can engage them, in them occasionally for perhaps social purposes or whatever they do, alcohol for example, the person who has a drink or two at a party twice a month. It's even possible to use other drugs that way. Again, I don't advocate them. But the reality is that most people that use most drugs, even repeatedly, never become addicted, which then… and I'm talking about 90 percent of people. So that again is to, is just to look at another myth concerning addiction, which is that drugs are addictive. Drugs are not in themselves addictive. If they were, then anyone whoever used a drug would be addicted to it. If the drug itself induced the addiction, then anybody who's ever tried that particular substance ought to be addicted to it. But of course, as we know, most people can have some relationship with alcohol without being addicted to it. Most people can try heroin, they can try cocaine, crystal meth, even repeatedly without being addicted to it, and one more time, I'm not advocating that, I'm only stating a scientific fact. So the real question to ask ourselves is what is it then, if it's not purely genetics, and I said that it wasn't, if I had said that it largely wasn't, if it's not genetics. And if it's not the drug itself, then what is it that predisposes people to addiction? Well, here's how then we begin to look at this biopsychosocial perspective. And I draw your attention now to an article that appeared in the journal, Pediatrics, this is the official journal of the American Pediatric Association. This article appeared in February of 2012. It was entitled, "An Integrated Scientific Framework for Child Survival and Early Childhood Development." And it was from the Harvard Center on the Developing Child. So, notice first of all that the review article comes from a highly prestigious scientific and academic center, number one, and number two, that it's published in as prestigious a journal as you can possibly have, the journal, the official journal of the American Pediatric Association. And I emphasize that to… one more time illustrate my point about how we don't base our practice on the evidence. 'Cause here's the evidence, published in a major journal and I hate to tell you, but most physicians I speak to, lecture with… lecture to, or medical students that I lecture to, they've had never heard of these studies. So that something happens between the publication of scientific evidence and… clinical practice where the evidence, this kind of evidence is very, very, very slow to penetrate clinical practice. And there's a reason for that, which we can perhaps discuss if there's time. But to come back to the article then, what do they say? They say that "Social and physical environments that threaten human development because of scarcity, stress or instability can lead to short-term physiologic and psychological adjustments that are necessary for immediate survival and adaptation, were which may come at a significant cost to long-term outcomes in learning, behavior, health and longevity." In short, they're saying that ways in which children adapt to early stress help them endure those difficulties in their formative year, but through same pathways that help them adapt later on become sources of dysfunction and even pathology, which threaten health and functionality. You know, there is that many problems that adults face begin as adaptations to childhood stress. Now, let me give you a highly personal example of that. I myself was diagnosed with ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, in my early 50s. I was a successful physician. I was functioning, but in many ways my life was chaotic and ADD did seem to explain what was going on with me. And in many ways, if it didn't explain it, it at least described it. Now, what I never brought into right from the beginning though was that this is some kind of a genetic disease, despite the fact that not only was I diagnosed, so were couple of my children. So if I'm diagnosed and so are my kids, how can this not be genetic? And, of course, in addiction it's the same question. You can certainly show that addictions run in families. I mean, the more likelihood, umm… the more you find addictive behaviors in one generation, the more likelihood is that you will find it cropping up in the next generation or subsequent generations, which seems to indicate a genetic causation, but not necessarily. So what I knew about the hallmark of ADD, which is a… unwilled and compulsive tuning out, absent mindedness, lack of emotional or psychological presence, you're just somewhere else, some of the time or much of the time, that is not a disease. What is that? What is tuning out actually? I already understood this just from my own experience and what I have seen in clinical practice that tuning out is a brain defense. It's a brain defense against vulnerability. Vulnerability comes from the Latin word "vulnerare," to wound. As human beings grow up profoundly vulnerable, we can be hurt from conception until death. There's absolutely nothing that the brain can do to protect us from vulnerability, but it can protect us from the awareness of vulnerability when that is too much to bear. And one of the ways, not the only way, but one of the ways that the brain protects us from venerability, at least from the awareness of it, is to have us to not, to not be present to what is stressing us. This is a very, this is called dissociation, it's a very well known phenomenon and it happens to people who've been traumatized or under severe stress. If I were to stress you right now or if someone close to you, physically close to you, were to stress you right now by, say, threatening you, you'd have the option of fighting back, escaping or seeking help. However, if those options were not available to you and the stress continued or even accelerated, then one way your brain could protect you would be to have you tune out. So this much I understood. And let me pause here to say, by the way, that ADD, attention deficit disorder, also happens to be a major risk factor for addiction. People with ADD are much more likely to be… or to become addicted, number one, and number two, if you're addicted, your chances of having ADD are significantly higher than that of the average population. And there are reasons for that, which I will explain later, but let me just throw that out to you right now, that if you work with addictions and if you don't screen your clients for ADD, you're missing a significant contributor, uh, to there addictive behaviors, in a significant minority of cases. So as I said, I understood so much that this tuning out was not a genetic issue. It wasn't a disease, it was some kind of copping pattern just as this Harvard article says. Here's what I didn't know and I didn't find until I began to research the subject almost by accident. And what I didn't know are the conditions and pathways by which the human brain develops. Now, I didn't know that because when I went to school in medical… went to medical school, uh, in mid '70s, this information wasn't yet extant, it wasn't just available, it wasn't collated, which is beginning to be put together, really. But the study of brain science, and specifically brain development, received a huge impetus in the 1990s when the first President Bush declared the decade the Decade of The Brain and lot of money and lot of brilliant scientific effort was expended on understanding the functioning of the brain. This work of course continues, and it's made great contributions to understanding of human life and human pathology and human function. And in specific, they studied the pathways and conditions by which the human brain develops. And again, I refer to the Harvard article, and here's about… here's how they sum up the information. "The architecture of the brain is constructed through an ongoing process that begins before birth." So keep that in mind, where we're having influences on the brain already before birth, which is to say in uterus. "Continues into adulthood and establishes either a sturdy or a fragile foundation for all the health and learning and behavior that follows." In other words, the architecture of brain is shaped by early experiences that begin before birth, continue throughout childhood and even into adulthood, and it forms the foundation of all the behavior, health and learning that fallows. Then they add, "The interactions of genes and experiences literally shapes the circuitry of the developing brain and is critically influenced by the mutual responsiveness of adult-child relationships, particularly in the childhood years." In other words, the critical influence on the development of the brain, when I say the development of the brain, I mean, the physiology and biology and neural chemistry of the brain. The number of receptors for certain substances, the availability of those substances, the connectivity and the formation of major brain circuits and brain systems is dependent on the emotional environment, the most important aspects of which is the neutral responsiveness of adult-child relationships. What do we have here? What we have here is a biopsychosocial model which says that the biology of the brain is conditioned by the psychological and social environment. And therefore, while it's important to recognize the biological dimensions, the neuron-physiological dimensions of addictions and any other condition, it is also important to recognize that the biology is not primary. The biology is shaped by the interaction of genes in environment and that the neuron-physiological function of any human being actually reflects the interaction of that particular temperament with the particular, immediate environment in which that temperament was, umm… nurtured. The primary factor in which is the quality of the adult-child relationship. So how, how can the physiology of the brain be affected? By emotional factors. Well, I've already mentioned stress and I mentioned how… when the parents are stressed, the children are stressed, and all that stress mechanism is then affected and get exhausted and makes it more likely to asthma for example. So, the stresses hormones have a significant impact on the nervous system. Now, stress of course is not just the psychological event, what it actually is, is a biological event which is a perturbation of the neovascular, cardiovascular, neurophysiological, hormonal arthritis and includes the immune system as well, so whenever there is stress all these systems are effected. That begins already in uterus, so we know from British studies for example, that if we are abused during pregnancy, that will have higher level of courtazoal in epic center and their children are given coutazoal has a significant impact under developing brain, their children are more likely to have behavior problems, learning disorders and indeed all of which is forced into addiction. We also know that, if we stress laboratory rats in a second time extra pregnancy by exposing them to loud sounds, for an extended period once a twice a week. Their offspring, probably more like to use cocaine and alcohol to sew themselves is adults. So, therefore… and I'm jumping out of it, but it also means that the prevention of addiction must begin at the very first prenatal visit. Because the more stress the women, the more likely it is that the child will have all kinds of negative, behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. And I would say addiction is of those possible outcomes. So, prenatal care must be much brighter than simply biological care, physical care of the women, it must also involve taking into account the psychological and social environment. And then we come to birth, now this is significant difference between human beings and other animals at the movement of birth and as significant difference is the evolved into the brain. Which human beings is relatively immature, compared to other animals. If you take a horse, it can run on a first day of life, human beings cannot master that degree of coordination, balance muscle control, visual acuity for a-year-and-half two years. Which is to say that the, equine animal is a year-and-a half to two-years ahead of us in terms of brain development. And that means that the development that in the horse occurred in the uterus in the womb, in the human being has to occur after birth outside the relative safety of the womb. When I say relative safety, 'cause they've already show you that already in uterus the emotional states of the mother and therefore for the social environment of the mother can have significant impact on a child then I could have given you many more examples of that, but uh, you know, simply at this point umm… you need to accept that the intervene into environment can have significant effects and that, what happens in uterus is already very important. And in my book I have a whole chapter on that and as many-many studies, but at this point I cannot them all, and then birth happens and then development outside the uterus happens. Now, the British anthropologist Ashley-Montagu great British anthropologist called the first nine months of life exterogestation. Exterogestation means, just station outside the uterus is compared with interogestation, which is just station inside the uterus, and when he said those basically is that the first nine-months outside the womb are as important for child development to be completed as the they even to environment is, so it's just the continuation of just station. Because, for human beings to get to the same level of anxiety development in neurophysiological and, and, and, and, and muscular development as other animals are already attain in the womb, we have to be just stated outside the womb for nine-months. So, the conditions that obtains during those nine-months and of course even beyond are crucial for child development. So, when you come back to ADD from in it. When I was diagnosed of ADD I was given Retlaman and subsequently Dexodrine in treatment and they helped. How did they help? They help by elevating the level of a chemical in the brain and the neural transmitter and chemical messenger in the brain called dopamine. And dopamine I'll be saying to you more about it in a few minutes is essential for incentive and motivation. Well, dopamine develops level in a child fluctuate with the emotional issue with a mother. So, you have infant monkeys and you measured that dopamine levels in the front part of the brain, you find them to be normal and then if you separate them from the mothers then you measure those dopamine levels again. A week later, those dopamine levels have significantly fallen in under of the newer transmitter level of the child, depend on the emotional presences of the mother. Similarly with dopamine receptors, receptors as you understand are molecular binding sides on the surfaces of cells were messengers substances can come and bind. So we have dopamine receptors which is why the neurotransmitter dopamine can have an impact on the cell. If you take monkeys at any age, and put them in isolation, the level of the dopamine receptors will fall, and then when you put them back into company as long as there're not bullied the dopamine receptors will rise to normal level again. If they are bullied, the dopamine receptors will stay at a low level. Again, in other words the physiology of the brain of the infant and even of the adult monkey, when it comes to dopamine is affected by the emotional relationships and by the social environment. So that's one example. To show you the inextricable connection, the close connection between the emotional states of the nurturing parent and the child, there was a study in Seattle that looked at EEGs, electro encephalograms of children, infants, six-months of age, whose mothers had postpartum depression. So they looked at the brain waves if you will, electrical activity of the child's brain, of infants whose mother were depressed, comparing them to infants of the same age whose mother were not depressed. And here's the thing, you could pretty much tell by the EEG of the infant, whose mother was depressed or not. In other words, the electrical circuitry of the child's brain is programmed by the emotional states of the mother by a whole set of influences. And again, the key factor is the mutual responsiveness of the infant child relationship and mothers who are depressed or parents who are stressed for their own reasons, for social economic reasons or because of their own result of childhood issues they can't be as attuned and as responsive to their kids as they want to be. It's not a question of do they love their kids, it's not the question of are they doing their best, it's a question of how attuned they are. So, then those… And if the parents are stressed and the kids will be stressed and, you know, I'll read you a quote from a wonderful California based spiritual teacher but someone who's also extraordinarily learned in western psychology his name is A. H. Almaas, A-L-M-A-A-S. And he writes in one of his books, "The child is very open and can feel the pain and suffering going on in its immediate environment. The child is aware of its own body and can also feel the tension, rigidity and pain in the body of the mother or of anyone else he is with. If the mother is suffering, the baby suffers too. The pain never gets discharged, the organism never develops the confidence that it can relegate itself, that things will happen the way they should." In other words, the emotional states of the mother program the child. And as the Dr. Daniel Siegel or well known to many of you I'm sure, of UCLA has pointed out that human connections make neuronol connections. Which nerves develop, depends on the human relations of the child, and Dr. Siegel says that, "For the infant and young child attachment relationships are the major environmental factors that shape development of the brain during its period of maximum growth. Attachment establishes an interpersonal relationship that helps the immature brain use the mature function of the parent's brain to organize its own processes." In other words, if you want to look at addiction as the brain disease, let us then look at the conditions under which that brain was actually shaped under which is actually developed. What do we find? When we look at the life histories of drug addicts, well, I can tell you or addicts in general by the way. What I can tell you is that in my work in Downtown Eastside, Vancouver over 14-years period, I never met a single female patient who had not been sexually abused as a child. I never met a single male, who had not been traumatized, neglected, abandoned and very often sexually abused. Now under such conditions the brain just doesn't develop the way it should. And that's not only my particular subjective observation that addictions have a lot to do with early childhood trauma has been brilliantly established by a large scale of population studies, particularly the so named Adverse Childhood Experiences studies ACEs, which all… Everybody interested in addictions or human behavior in general are to familiar themselves, with these ACE's studies have been published widely in medical generals and elsewhere. In a nutshell an average child that experiences physical, sexual and emotional abuse, parent dying, a parent being in jailed, bonds in the families, mental illness in the family, a rankers divorce particularly. In other words anything that interferes with the attachment relationship between child and parent. And for each of these adverse childhood experiences the risk of the addiction goes up exponentially so by the time a male child has sixth of these, his risk of becoming an ejection using susbasitic is 46-100 percent greater for a six-fold increase over a male child with no such experiences. And so these researchers concluded, just as I have that addiction is experience dependent. Now I could go into the brain biology of addiction in a little bit more depth and I will do that very, very briefly. First of all, we mentioned… I mentioned ADD, well, as I also said ADD is treated with stimulants such as rythmol dexedrine that elevate dopamine levels. Dopamine again, as again being the brain chemical that modulates incentive and motivation. What else elevates dopamine levels? All the stimulants too, that means cocaine, nicotine, caffeine and the amphetamines, crystal meth. That actually means, that a significant minority of addicted clients, particularly when it comes to stimulant drugs but also to alcohol, which soothe the hyperactive brain as does cannabis. So significant number of people, with these addictions are actually self medicating ADHD. Not all of them but a significant minority. In other words the addiction is a self meditation and that's through all across the board. These days we talk a lot about concurrent disorders, in other words, a medical or sorry a mental health disorder that co-occurs with the addiction. I take that for granted, because most people who are addicted are actually self medicating, people self medicate as I said, ADHD with caffeine, with alcohol with nicotin, with cocaine, with crystal meth. People self medicate post-traumatic stress disorder, with the opiates and tranquilizers. The opiates temporarily soothe and in a long term exacerbate post-traumatic stress disorder. People self medicate anxiety with tranquilizers, with alcohol, with marijuana. They self medicate social phobias with the same substances. People self medicate bipolar illness particularly with alcohol. People self medicate depression with drugs just as Prozac and the other SSRI antidepressants elevate dopamine levels in the brain… I'm sorry serotonin levels in the brain, serotonin being the chemical largely indicated in mood regulation. So does cocaine elevate serotonin levels temporally. So people self medicate depression with drugs. So you might take it as well for granted that your clients may have a self medication problem and a concurrent disorder. And this whole idea that's very prevalent in rehabilitation circles that you got to deal with the addiction before you deal with the other problem to my mind is false, because the addiction very often reflects an underlying disorder. And so if we don't address that, how can we possibly deal with its behavioral manifestation or the person's attempt to soothe themselves. So I see addiction in self soothing in many, many ways not just in the sense of people are self medicating specific physiological or psychiatric disorders but also in the sense that's very apparent to anybody who talks to an addict. And if I were to ask the audience watching this video to or live feed to raise their hands and say, how many of you have been addicted? How many by my definition of addiction many of you would put your hands up and some of you would have been addicted to substances or like me for example to certain behaviors. And then if I asked you, what did this addiction do for you in a short term? As I often ask my audiences, what will they tell me? Oh, they helped me deal stress. Oh, the addiction made me feel more connected to other people. Oh, the addiction maybe gave me more inner peace. Oh, the addiction, when I was engaging in it gave me more confidence. And any number of other answers, in other words what people say is that the addictive behavior in the shot term made them feel more like a normal human being. In other words the addictions have a purpose, they don't represent simply a disease although the disease in model is helpful in some ways to understand it. The addictions actually represents not some much the problem although it creates its own problems, but it reflects a person's attempt to solve a problem. And then the question again becomes, if you want to understand, why a person lacks inner peace, why a person lacks confidents, why a person is in emotional pain that they have to escape from it, why a person feels so stressed that only through the behavior are they able to soothe this stress. How come they don't have stress regulations in their brains and psychology to handle life stresses had on, you can't look at their genes. The genes again may make them more sensitive but it's the life experiences that we have to look at. So that's one level to understand addictions is a coping mechanism. And there was Dr. Vincent Felitti, the San Diego based physician, who's one of the lead investigators of the Adverse Childhood Experience studies, which again I encourage everybody to get familiar with. And he's the one who said, I think very succinctly, "Dismissing addictions as bad habits or self-destructive behavior comfortably hides their functionality in the life of the addict." In other words, the addiction servers a purpose, let's find out what that is, and let's find out how to help those people achieve those purposes without the addictive behaviors. Instead of just focusing on how bad the addiction is, let's stop it. To return them to the brain physiology of addiction, why is it that drugs such as opiates derived from the poppy, Asian poppy work on a human brain? Well, first of all we have been using the opiates for thousands of years, and when I was working in palliative care, I relied on them daily in large quantities to help people not suffer agonizing pain from cancer and other sources. So opiates are the most powerful pain relievers that we have, what's important to understand in this context is that the opiates don't only soothe physical pain, they also sooth the emotional pain. As a matter of fact it turns out that the same part of the brain that modulates and experiences the suffering of physical pain also experiences the suffering of emotional pain and this part of the brain is heavily endowed with opiate receptors. In fact if you look at some of the other drugs implicated in addictions and I would say all the behaviors too, there's always a pain relieving quality at least in a sense of distracting you from pain. But very specifically cocaine is a local anesthetic it numbs nerve endings, alcohol is an analgesic, you know, what we say about people will drink too much, oh, they're not feeling any pain. We know that cannabis has analgesic properties and that's used increasingly in medical care. In short what I'm saying is that the question on addiction is not why the addiction, but why the pain. And again to understand people's pain you can't look at their genes. Although, if you're very sensitive by genetic temperament you're gonna feel more pain when things go bad, that's true. But you also have to look at and primarily have to look at their life experiences. Of course, the other reason to look at life experiences and its results is because the results of life experiences in terms of brain physiology and also in terms of psychological functioning and emotional beliefs, and self-concept, and spiritual loss, those are reversible. Genetic are not reversible. So let's concentrate on those large aspects of the addiction map that are actually amendable to change by environment. They were caused by the environment, they can be changed by an environment if we offer a different environment. In other words, if we have a developmental view of addiction, rather than a genetic disease model, then we can look forward to healthy development later on. There's one thing we know about the human brain is that it has this capacity called neuroplasticity, and neuroplasticity means that the brain can develop new circuits in response to new experiences. And this we know from both human experience and animal studies can occur even later on in life and short of dementia even in old age. So the point is, what do people need to develop new circuits? What do people need to develop a new concept of themselves? What do they need to overcome the impact of early trauma? Now why is that opiates work in the brain? Oh, of course, 'cause we have receptors for them, I already talked about receptors. Why do we have receptors for something that comes from an Asian poppy? The answer is we do not. What we have our receptors for our own natural internally manufactured opiates, which are called endorphins. And endorphin simply means endogenous morphine like substance. And we have endorphins because they're important to human life. In fact, without them life is not even possible. I will not go into the many functions that endorphins or natural morphine like substances play in human life from the immune system to the intestines to the mucous membranes. I will talk about the three major roles in the brain. Number one, pain relief, we already talked about that. Life will be difficult, in fact impossible without some internal source of pain relief. Secondly the endorphins modulate our experiences of pleasure and reward. So when we experience relation happiness joy that's because we have endorphins circuits engaged. Again, you can see how important that is in human life. And number three and this is the least appreciated aspect of the endorphin activity in human life, the endorphins modulate the experience of attachment. And attachment means the closeness in proximity with another human being for the purposes of being taken care of or to take care of another person. So parental child attachment has one function, one major function, so that the child will be cared for. Infant mice whose endorphins receptors have been genetically knocked out, so called knockout mice will not focalize distress on separation from their mothers. What would that mean in the wild? Their death. In other words, and especially given the utter dependency helplessness and immaturity of the mammalian infant or even the avian infant, but most particularly the human infant, which is the least mature, most helpless, most dependant of any creature in the universe at birth. Attachment is the key dynamic in human life, without which there's just no possibility of life. And that's modulated by the endorphins, that's why the lethal hold of addictions. As a patient of mine said to me once, a sex-trade worker, "When I first did heroin" she said "it made me feel like a warm soft hug." In other were she was saying, "I felt loved." Why did she need that drug to make you feel that way? Well, what happened during childhood, the typical history of the extreme addict, which is trauma. If we return to a question of brain development then, the fact is that without the necessary addictions, without the optimal conditions, which is the presence of emotionally available, consistently available, non-stressed, non-depressed, attuned parenting care givers, those circuits do not develop the way they should. Neither do the dopamine circuits or incentive and motivation. So if you take another knock out mice, a mouse whose dopamine receptors that been knocked out genetically and give this mice food, you give this little mouse food in the laboratory, he will eat it, swallow it, chew it, enjoy it, but if you place the food a few inches away from him, he will not budge to eat it, 'cause he's got no incentive to do anything. He will actually starve to death. Now children whose earlier environment was so stressed, that their dopamine receptors and dopamine circuits did not develop properly, naturally are gonna find tremendous temporary benefit from taking a drug like cocaine, or crystal meth that all of a sudden elevates dopamine levels, now they feel alive and motivated. Again, it goes back to early experience. Now if you look at my own infancy and I won't say much about it here expect to tell you that I was born in Budapest in 1944 to a Jewish mother in Hungary, two months before the German, the German army occupied Hungary. And for the first year of my life I lived under Nazi occupation under terrible conditions, with a mother who was anxious, terrorized, depressed by the death of parents in Auschwitz, whose husband was away in forced labor, not knowing whether he was dead or alive. You can imagine what kind of input my brain circuits received, you can imagine how much I would have automatically tuned out in my first year of life, and when would I have tuned out? When my brain circuits were developing, when every second in this space of time millions of connections are being made, and guess what? My dopamine surfaces are not getting the right input and 50-years later I'm diagnosed with ADD. Also because of that early loss, I get the message that I'm not wanted. Not 'cause my mother didn't want me, but because my mother was miserable around me, how could she be otherwise? Not because of me but around me. But the child takes everything personally. If the mother's in pain, the child is in pain, the mother suffers, the child suffers and the child being a narcissist legitimately so thinks that the world is all about him, therefore my mother is so unhappy, she can't want me. How do I compensate for that? 34-years later I become a medical doctor. My unconscious belief is they may not want me, but they're gonna need me, which makes me a workaholic doctor, which make me unavailable to my own kids, which creates stresses in my own family. That is to say, in my marriage, which means that now my kids live in a stressed environment. It's not the case that everybody who was diagnosed with addiction necessarily suffered extreme trauma such as my Downtown, Eastside clients. That's the extreme end of the scale. What is the case that everybody becomes addicted lived in a highly stressed environmentally in life, whether they realized that or not? And as D.W. Winnicott, the great British child psychologist said, psychiatrists said, "Two things can go wrong in childhood, when things happen that they shouldn't such as the trauma, the abuse or when things don't happen that should have happened, which is the attuned non-stretched relationship with the parenting figures." So the most stress there's in a child's life, in the parent's life, the more likely you're gonna see the addictions. It doesn't mean that everybody who was stressed or traumatized will become addicted, but it does mean that everybody who's addicted was stressed or traumatized. There are other outcomes as the Adverse Childhood Experiences study showed, for example, not just the risk of addiction goes up with childhood trauma or adversity, so does the risk of mental illness, so the risk of other risky or dysfunctional behavior, so the risk of autoimmune disease, psychosis and even cancer. So addiction is one of the possible outcomes of earlier adversity, it's not the only one. What are the other impacts of that early adversity and stress? Well, we already talked about the physiological outcomes, I have mentioned to some degree the psychological outcomes, which primarily have to do with loss of self-worth and shame, because when bad stuff happens to a kid the child takes that personally and believes that it's because of her or him which means there's a deeply inbred shame in many, many addicts. Now we think the shame is because we did something wrong. We think were ashamed because, we engaged in addictive behaviors. And it's true enough that addictive behaviors induce shame, why? Because addictive behaviors are often manipulated, are often dishonest. I've been that way when I have engaged in addictive behaviors. It means that we lie, we pretend, we heard to people close to us. And those behaviors properly induce a healthy level of shame. I think Bill Wilson the fonder of AA talked about a healthy level of shame or some other phrase to the same effect. And that's fine but underlying the addiction is a deeper shame about one's very core existence and that's induced by that early loss. Also induced by the early loss is a certain view of the world. Now the Buddha says somewhere that, "Everything is mind in the lead." Which means how we see the world and the kind of thoughts and beliefs that we have, actually define a world that we live in. So I feel, if I believe that the world is hostile and I always have to be defensive and on the lookout for attack, I will live in a very different world than somebody who believes that fundamentally the world is benign and help is available if they know where to ask for it. I'm going to live in a different world. And I'm gonna create a different world based on those beliefs. What the Buddha didn't say, and this is the task of modern psychology to have pointed out is that before with our minds we create the world, the world creates our minds. And what kind of world do those early stressful experiences create? A world which is not safe, a world in which we are alone, a world in which we have to scratch and rue to get the things that we want, they're not going to be forthcoming to us. A world in which they may be no God, or there's no benign God in any way or a God that's punishing us for being bad, so it affects our point of view on spirituality as well. It affects how they're gonna deal with other people. For example, your client comes into your office. And you are really intent on helping them and they're coming to you for help. So here's two people. Somebody wants help somebody else wants to provide for help. But guess who you are? You are an authority figure, whose job it is to nurture and to support and to help. What were their early experiences with care givers, who are supposed to nurture and help and support? Well, often very negative ones. Often it was these people who actually hurt them. Guess what? They're not going to trust you. Why will then I trust you? Not because of anything you've done yet to them. But simply because their memory is that of caregivers who are you doing different or perhaps even harmful. And that memory may not even be conscious, because we have two kinds of memories. We have explicit memories and explicit memory means that we recall specifically what happened or what we witnessed. But explicit memories don't begin to be laid down till after the age year-and-a-half because the brain structure, the hippocampus that holds explicit memory isn't even developed until then, doesn't begin to develop until then. And so many of us lack memory, recall for many years of our childhood. Certainly most people don't recall anything till they're three. In fact most people don't recall anything till they're five. But there's another kind of memory which is the emotional memory of the experiences laid done already in uterus that are held in the body and which are held in the psyche unconsciously. And this is the emotional imprint of early experiences. So for example, people who are adopted, tend to have a very deep lifelong sense of abandonment, which means that when we look at them the wrong way or if you're speaking to them and you look away in the middle of conversation, they immediately are triggered into shame and a sense of abandonment, which is not what's happened in the moment. All that's happened is that somebody looked away but their memory of abandonment by their birth mother gets triggered without the recall. So all they have is the sense of emotional abandonment and they think it's in the present. It's very important to understand this dynamic of implicit memory. But that's what we're dealing with all the time. That's what we deal with in our relationships. That's what we deal with in our sense of ourselves. That's what we deal with in how he view the world. And so if you can understand the early experience of the addict, then you can know what kind of implicit memories you're bringing into your office which means that how we treat these people is the very cornerstone of whether we can help them or not. So as I come unto the conclusion or close to the conclusion of this talk, the point I need to emphasize more strongly is that number one, the brain can develop new circuits even later on in life, neuroplasticity, we know this. Number two, the development of these new circuits depend on conditions. And therefore number three, our job as healthcare givers, our job as law makers, our job as addition counselors, as psychologists, as support workers, anybody involved with an addict who's taken on the task of helping that person first needs to understand that the primary condition for helping those people is establishing a relationship with them that gives them precisely what they didn't have in the first place, which is attuned, mindful, compassionate, regard, non-judgment, not exclusion, non-osterization, non-punishment. That's very difficult. I find it difficult, because like everybody else I get triggered. I find my mind full of judgments, nothing wrong with that, as long as I realize that any judgment I make about another person is actually about myself. Which is why the Buddha said, "Don't try and straighten somebody else before you make sure that you're not crooked at yourself." Or as Jesus says, "Before you try to move the sliver from your brother's eye, make sure that you remove the pull from your own eye." And both of these spiritual masters are both saying, is that our judgments of other people are always about ourselves. And so if we notice our judgments, nothing wrong with that, we're not doing it. My brain is doing the judgment by itself, I don't decide to just somebody. The judgment just arises, if I notice the judgment and take responsibility for it and realize that it's about and me, then I will not project on to the client. Then I can mean a safe, accepting attuned individual. On the other hand, if I make it about them, then even if I do so with the best of good will, what are they going to pick up? They going to pick up that they're being attacked, because people pick up more in our tone and our body language and our emotional stance than they do on our words. I wish I could speak to you much longer about techniques and practices based on this understanding relation that I've just tried to outline for you, but I think I have to begin with the basics, which is if you understand addiction as the result of life experiences that occurred to in some cases genetically sensitive individuals, then if you also realize that life experiences in adulthood can help people function better by actually changing their brains. And by helping them transform those early implicit memories so that those implicit memories no longer control there behaviors, then we have a new understanding of addiction treatment. Which again is not based on symptom control simply, it's not based on behavior change but it's based on psychological and spiritual transformation. And here's where practices such as harm reduction comes into it. Harm reduction for example seems to be controversial in some circles. People say, "Do you believe in abstinence or do you believe in harm reduction?" It's not a question of one or the other. I believe in whatever works for that individual at that time, we have to begin with how the individual is at this particular moment. Not how I wish them to be, but how they actually are. So for some people, abstinence based models are absolutely appropriate and necessary for others they're not there. And then, harm reduction means, what, it means, giving people clean needles to inject with. It means, perhaps providing them with a safe site to inject and in Vancouver we have North America's only supervised injection site. It means helping people inject into veins that are not as dangerous as for example, as if they were trying to inject into the necks as I've seen many times, which is a sure way to get a brain abscess. That's harm reduction. You say, oh, but that condones or encourages addiction. It doesn't encourage anything it simply acknowledges that the person is addicted. And right now I have to accept them exactly the way they are if I'm going to be a healthcare provider. And I want to help them reduce the harm from the addiction. That's what harm reduction means. That does not mean that abstinence is not my ultimate goal. An interesting thing is that the most important aspect of harm reduction is not actually, just the clean needles, just the saving of money, because people are no longer transmitting HIV and have Hepatitis C to one another, which are significant savings by the way. But also that for the first time a person might feel that they're accepted and respected for exactly who they are. And that itself is transformative. So again it's not just behavior change that we want although we do want that, actually want our goal is a transformation in individual relationship to themselves. And that's where the word recovery comes in. Recovery means, what? The finding of something. And what is it that people find when they recover? They find themselves, you ask any addict who's recovered, what did you find? Oh, I found myself. What did you recover? I recovered myself. That means that that self that true self that authentic self, never went away, people just, just lost sight of it. And really our job is to help people find themselves. That means you don't make war on them. And the war on drugs, even by its own standards has been a total and abject failure, it has not reduced drug use and it is incurred and continues to incur a lot of suffering. Which makes sense, because when you attack people, you're going to stress them more, which is going to induce more addictive behavior on their part. Not to mention that there's a real social and racial bias to the war on drugs, for example, there's this myth that crack cocaine is more addictive than in the snorted powder cocaine. It's not true, but if you look at the United States. The punishments for crack cocaine were five or ten times as onerous as those for powder cocaine. What's the racial background? The racial background is that poor blacks are far more likely to use the cheaper crack cocaine than the finally fine powdered cocaine that middle class or upper class whites could afford. No physiological difference, no addictive potential difference, simply a social, racial question. So bringing this to a close, addiction is not the primary disease of the brain. It is a disease of the brain, and of course the more you use the more diseased your brain will become. But the primary problem is social, economic, cultural, and I would say, spiritually poor environment that stresses people, that makes it difficult for parents to raise kids in a healthy way. And that therefore induces addictive behaviors in a lot of people as a way of coping with their stresses, a way of soothing their pain. And our path to helping these people is to help them understand what their experience has being and to give them the possibility of not needing to resort to those addictive behaviors whether its substance related, whether it's shopping, whether it's gambling in order to have their needs met.
