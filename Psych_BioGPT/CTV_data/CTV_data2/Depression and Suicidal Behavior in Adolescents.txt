Depression and Suicidal Behaviour in Adolescents Dr. Alison Wood Consultant Child Psychiatrist 

00:00:00
DR. ALISON WOOD  Over the past 15 years, there's been growing public concern about depression and suicide in young people. Statistics reveal how suicide is a significant cause of death among young people, and how the rates for young males have risen steadily over the past decade. In contrast to the slightly declining rates in the adult population. While suicide is a tragedy for the individual involved, the consequences for the rest of the family are immeasurable. Richard Harrington, Professor of Child and Adolescents Psychiatry in Manchester talks to a mother who describes losing her son through suicide. 

00:00:45
  We thought we must be the only person that it possibly could happen to. I thought it only happened in families where uhm, by the parents perhaps, you know, didn't care as much for their children or the children were creating a lot of problems. I didn't ever think... (crosstalk) 

00:01:05
PROF. RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

00:01:05
 ...suicide was really not in my vocabulary. 

00:01:05
RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. But it sounds like from his note that he'd been quite, at least for, at that time he'd been quite down, is that right? 

00:01:15
 Well, he talked about feeling unhappy from September... (crosstalk) 

00:01:15
RICHARD HARRINGTON  Right. 

00:01:20
 ...and he died in November. 

00:01:20
RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

00:01:20
 So, it didn't seem a particularly long time... (crosstalk) 

00:01:25
RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

00:01:25
 ...two months. 

00:01:25
RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. But the note, from the note it sounds that he had really got quite bleak. And, and, obviously. 

00:01:30
 Yes, well, he said he saw no future. 

00:01:35
RICHARD HARRINGTON Right, right. And how old was he when he, when he killed himself? 

00:01:35
 Seventeen. 

00:01:35
DR. ALISON WOOD  This video is concerned with depression and suicidal behavior in adolescents. There are important links between depression and self harm in adolescents, although most young people who are depressed, do not attempt suicide. First of all, how common ah, are depressive disorders in children and adolescents? Amongst primary school children, about one in 50 girls and about one in 200 boys will be suffering from depressive disorders. Well, by the time they're in secondary school the figures have risen to one in 25 girls and about one in 100 boys. It is therefore a problem which all G.P.s will come across. The video is divided into three parts, First of all, we're going to talk about the recognition of depression and suicidality. And then look in more detail at assessment. Finally, we will discuss management. 

00:02:35
RECOGNITION 

00:02:35
DR. ALISON WOOD John Miller is a G.P. in Stockport. Here are some familiar situations from his surgery. 

00:02:40
DR. JOHN MILLER  Hello, Mrs. Williams. Hi Louise. 

00:02:45
MRS. WILLIAMS Hi.

00:02:50
MRS. WILLIAMS  and, and pains in the stomach as well. 

00:02:55
DR. JOHN MILLER All right. Now, we've seen you quite a few times over the last few months. I think this is about the fourth time we've been, we've met here at the practice. Uhm, the thing's aren't so good. You're still getting the tummy aches? 

00:03:05

00:03:15
DR. JOHN MILLER Yeah. 

00:03:15
LOUISE POLLITT ...different, a lot sorer than indigestion now. 

00:03:20
DR. JOHN MILLER And how often are you getting those? 

00:03:20
LOUISE POLLITT Everyday. 

00:03:20
DR. JOHN MILLER  Everyday. 

00:03:25
LOUISE POLLITT Yup. 

00:03:25
DR. JOHN MILLER And how long had it been happening altogether now? Mom, what do you think? 

00:03:25
MRS. WILLIAMS  Oh! Weeks, months, uhm, can't remember now, it seems, seems like forever. 

00:03:35
DR. JOHN MILLER When we first saw her in March, which is say, six months ago, when you had the headaches and you developed the tummy aches since then. Have you tried anything else with the headaches? Are you taking anything else? 

00:03:45
MRS. WILLIAMS I... (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
LOUISE POLLITT No. 

00:03:45
MRS. WILLIAMS ...don't want to give her anything stronger really... (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
DR. JOHN MILLER  No. 

00:03:50
MRS. WILLIAMS ...just paracetamol. But it, it just didn't seem to have any effect. 

00:03:50
DR. JOHN MILLER  Tell me a little bit more about them. What sort of time a day do they come on? 

00:03:55
LOUISE POLLITT Never in the mo, when I get up in the morning they're not there but... (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
DR. JOHN MILLER Right. 

00:04:00
LOUISE POLLITT ...when I goes to school then. Well, it just starts all. (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
MRS. WILLIAMS Hmm. When she's come home from school sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
LOUISE POLLITT Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
MRS. WILLIAMS ...complaining of headache, you know. 

00:04:10
DR. JOHN MILLER How much time of school did you missed? 

00:04:10
MRS. WILLIAMS Quite a lot lately. (crosstalk). 

00:04:10
LOUISE POLLITT Quite a lot. 

00:04:10
DR. JOHN MILLER  Morning, Sharlene, how are you? 

00:04:15
SHARLENE BARDSLEY  All right. 

00:04:20
DR. JOHN MILLER How's life treating you? 

00:04:20
SHARLENE BARDSLEY Okay. 

00:04:20
DR. JOHN MILLER Good. Now, last time we met you're having quite a lot of headaches. How are they are getting on? 

00:04:25
SHARLENE BARDSLEY  Just the same. They're just, just as bad as ever. 

00:04:30
DR. JOHN MILLER Now, they were there everyday. Is that still the same? 

00:04:35
SHARLENE BARDSLEY Yeah, just like that first time. 

00:04:35
DR. JOHN MILLER Yeah. 

00:04:35
SHARLENE BARDSLEY  So. 

00:04:40
DR. JOHN MILLER And you're seeing Dr. Banes, you're seeing Dr. Richardson and I saw you about three months ago. And are there, are there still happening the same way? 

00:04:45
SHARLENE BARDSLEY  Yeah, it's just no different at all; it's just exactly the same. 

00:04:50
DR. JOHN MILLER And this is the third pill that you're on now, third contraception pill. Tell me, have you noticed any difference with the, with the efforts that we've made. 

00:05:00
SHARLENE BARDSLEY No. 

00:05:00
DR. JOHN MILLER No. 

00:05:00
SHARLENE BARDSLEY Just as bad, nothing has ... (crosstalk). 

00:05:00
DR. JOHN MILLER We did. (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
SHARLENE BARDSLEY ... changed. 

00:05:05
DR. JOHN MILLER We did changed the progesterone in your pill last time. And it, it hasn't affected the headaches? (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
SHARLENE BARDSLEY Well, its not helping, is it? 

00:05:10
DR. JOHN MILLER Something else I noticed since you came in to me three months ago is that you look as though you lost a little bit of weight. 

00:05:15
SHARLENE BARDSLEY  Yeah, well, uhm, I've been dieting and about a lot 'coz uhm, 'coz my boyfriend thinks that I'm a bit overweight and that well, so I am. 

00:05:30
DR. JOHN MILLER What else is happening at home? 

00:05:30
SHARLENE BARDSLEY  Just the same in it, without going out all the time.

00:05:40
DR. JOHN MILLER  They're your two younger sisters? 

00:05:45
SHARLENE BARDSLEY Yeah. 

00:05:45
DR. JOHN MILLER You're, you're sort of a mom some of the time are you? 

00:05:45
SHARLENE BARDSLEY  Ah, kinda yes boss, she's never in though, was she? She never in. 

00:05:55
DR. JOHN MILLER Well, what we're gonna do is we're gonna have another go with changing your pill but this will probably be our last time and I'll give you a pill today that has got the lowest dose of both Estrogen and Progesterone and we'll see if this helps your headaches. Uhm, I'd like you to come back and see me in a couple of months and you can tell me what you think. And we'll see, we'll just see what you think of the new preparation. Can I put me on the scales in a moment? Is that alright with you? 

00:06:25
SHARLENE BARDSLEY Yeah. 

00:06:30

00:06:35
MRS. WILSON Good morning. 

00:06:35
DR. JOHN MILLER How are things with you? 

00:06:35
MRS. WILSON Ah, well, it could be better. It, it's, it's Andrew again I'm afraid. 

00:06:40
DR. JOHN MILLER Yes, and we've got him in the, in the list for today. (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
MRS. WILSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
DR. JOHN MILLER He's not with you though today? (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
MRS. WILSON No, no he is not, I tried to persuade him to come, but no he wouldn't. So, so I thought to come instead. 

00:06:50
DR. JOHN MILLER Well, we don't see much of him, I mean, last time I saw him he was ah, he was just starting secondary school... (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
MRS. WILSON Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
DR. JOHN MILLER ...I don't think I've seen him for quite a while. What, what, sort... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
MRS. WILSON No. 

00:07:00
DR. JOHN MILLER ...of things have been going on? 

00:07:00
MRS. WILSON Well, you know, we have that problem with, you know, sniffing and aerosols and that drug. (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
MRS. WILSON I think, I think he started again. I mean, I noticed that few of my things have, have gone missing and ah, I found one under his bed the other day. It was just, I don't know, it's just something a bit odd about him. You know, as if little, little bit spiced out all the time. 

00:07:25
DR. JOHN MILLER So you're fairly sure he's using uhm, aerosols and glue... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
MRS. WILSON Well I, I think. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
DR. JOHN MILLER ...type things again? 

00:07:30
MRS. WILSON Yeah, I think, I think he's at it again. 

00:07:30
DR. JOHN MILLER So what's Andrew been like at home? Tell me what's been happening. 

00:07:35
MRS. WILSON Well, he don't wanna seem, he won't seem to do anything, you know, he, he stood(ph) most about the house, he won't get up in the morning, and then when he just, he gets up about lunchtime, goes out, God knows where. I'd, I don't know where he goes, 'coz he didn't... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
MRS. WILSON ...seem to have any friends anymore and, and then he comes back in, when he, when he's hungry. 

00:07:55
DR. JOHN MILLER What did he say when you mentioned that you're gonna come to the doctors. What what, in what way, did he. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
MRS. WILSON Well, he just grunted. 

00:08:00
DR. JOHN MILLER He grunted. 

00:08:00
MRS. WILSON Whew. The usual, you know, he always just rebuts me head off. 

00:08:05
DR. JOHN MILLER So he wasn't keen on coming? 

00:08:05
MRS. WILSON Well, certainly he wasn't. 

00:08:05
DR. JOHN MILLER  And this morning he just stayed in bed? 

00:08:10
MRS. WILSON Yeah. 

00:08:10
DR. JOHN MILLER So you're the one left with all the problems really. 

00:08:10
MRS. WILSON Well, at the moment, 'coz his dad's still inside. 

00:08:15
DR. JOHN MILLER Yeah, dad's in prison and your son's in bed, and you're here worrying about them all. 

00:08:20
MRS. WILSON Yeah, certainly. (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
DR. JOHN MILLER It's so unfair, isn't it really? 

00:08:20
MRS. WILSON No, certainly isn't, but then, just ah, so as the, so as the mothers I have to put up with it, isn't it? 

00:08:25
DR. JOHN MILLER Are you still continuing your treatment? 

00:08:25
MRS. WILSON  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DR. JOHN MILLER Are you still taking the tablets I've given you? 

00:08:30
MRS. WILSON Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, I've got about another week, I think. 

00:08:30
DR. JOHN MILLER If we look back through your records, really. And you, you've had a lot of burdens in the past, you've had a lot of... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
MRS. WILSON Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
DR. JOHN MILLER ...ah, problems happening in life and I've just been looking through your records before you came in and, and probably over the last 12 years, on and off, ah, you've been depressed. Do you find yourself worrying about uhm, everybody? Do you feel as though you're carrying the, the burdens of the family on your shoulders? 

00:09:00
MRS. WILSON Well, yes, I suppose I do, but then, you know, my mom always said it's, it's always the mother that has to, you know, does all the worrying for everybody. 

00:09:05
DR. JOHN MILLER So, yeah. Did you (inaudible ). 

00:09:08
DR. JOHN MILLER  Well, Sophie what's happened here. That looks like a right shiner. I thought your mom was left-handed. (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
MRS. BURNS Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
DR. JOHN MILLER Mrs. Burns what's happened? 

00:09:20
MRS. BURNS Well, trouble at school again, I'm afraid. And it's, (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
DR. JOHN MILLER Oh, yeah. 

00:09:25
MRS. BURNS it's a bit of the shiner, isn't it? 

00:09:25
DR. JOHN MILLER Hmm 

00:09:25
MRS. BURNS Well, go on, tell him about it. 

00:09:30
DR. JOHN MILLER Tell me what happened Sophie. 

00:09:30
SOPHIE ALI I was, I was walking home and there was, there was some girls behind the bench and as I walked pass, they just jumped at me for no reason. I don't know why. 

00:09:40
DR. JOHN MILLER What damage did they do, they've obviously hit your eye or did they kick you? 

00:09:45
SOPHIE ALI No, they just dragged me with my hair and then they, then the biggest one, she punched me and then they ran off. 

00:09:50
DR. JOHN MILLER Is there anything else been damaged, did they hurt you anywhere else? In your tummy? 

00:09:55
SOPHIE ALI No. 

00:09:55
DR. JOHN MILLER No. 

00:09:55
MRS. BURNS  No, I think she was just a bit shaken up. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
DR. JOHN MILLER Yeah. When was this? 

00:10:00
SOPHIE ALI It was sometime last week, I think. 

00:10:05
DR. JOHN MILLER Right, obviously the school know Mrs. Burns. 

00:10:10
MRS. BURNS Oh yes. 

00:10:10
DR. JOHN MILLER Yeah, I'll need to make some notes about the eye, of course. But tell me, uhm, this is not the first time? I can remember seeing you a year or two ago. 

00:10:20
MRS. BURNS Oh yes, but that, that was at the other school... (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
DR. JOHN MILLER Yeah. 

00:10:20
MRS. BURNS ...and she's changed school since, at about uhm, about a month ago, isn't it? 

00:10:25
SOPHIE ALI Yeah. 

00:10:25
DR. JOHN MILLER What year are you in now? 

00:10:25
DR. JOHN MILLER  So, Sophie, tell me, ah, how school have been since ah, since you are attacked? That was last week. How is it been this week? 

00:10:35
SOPHIE ALI I can't face it, I can't go in school, I can't go in. I can't face goin' in. I know it's gonna happen again if I go in. 

00:10:45
DR. JOHN MILLER Have you been in this morning? 

00:10:45
MRS. BURNS Well, we thought we'd come and see you first and then, then I'll... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
MRS. BURNS ...take her down to, to school. If you think... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
DR. JOHN MILLER (inaudible ). 

00:10:53
MRS. BURNS ...she's ready to go back. 

00:10:55
SOPHIE ALI I can't go in. 

00:10:55
MRS. BURNS You have too, some time. 

00:10:55
SOPHIE ALI I can't go back in school. You don't know what it's like. 

00:11:00
MRS. BURNS Well, you've got to stick up for yourself. 

00:11:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Although none of these adolescents present as classically depressed, there are clues as to an underlying depressive disorder. Richard Harrington, professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Manchester, goes on to explain about the difficulties in recognition and diagnosis. 

00:11:20
RICHARD HARRINGTON I think it starts with, with thinking about the diagnosis. I think all of us in Psychiatry as well as in general practice until quite recently didn't think that depression is much of a problem in adolescents. Uhm, I think ah, that mild feelings of depression and unhappiness and strong emotional reactions to events are really quite common... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON ...and ah, it's easy to dismiss those and indeed uhm, a lot of adolescents will feel miserable from time to time but will, will uhm, recover very quickly. But there is a small minority who have quite serious persistent depressive stage that can last for many months or even years and not uncommonly as I said with quite serious suicidal behavior. One of the big problems is that depression in young people presents in quite unusual ways. Sometimes, young people, adolescents, ah, present in exactly the same ways as adults. But more commonly when they present to general practitioners they'll present with ah, a typical symptoms. 

00:12:15
WARNING SIGNS OF DEPRESSION IN ADOLESCENTS 

00:12:15
DR. ALISON WOOD  The four consultations we saw earlier illustrate some important warning signs which should lead you to consider depression as a possible factor. If the child is presenting with symptoms which cannot be explained by a medical condition- 

00:12:35
unexplained pains 

00:12:35
DR. ALISON WOOD - it is important to consider the possibility of depression. For example, in the first interview, all tests had come back negative. And the G.P. could not make a diagnosis. Similarly, frequent attendance for relatively trivial complaints can suggest an underlying emotional problem. Charlene was clearly a regular visitor to the G.P. He picked up on her weight loss, which, along with the disturbed sleep patterns are particularly suggestive of depression. 

00:13:05
eating/sleep problems 

00:13:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Mrs. Wilson complained about Andrew staying up all night. While in some cases this may be normal- 

00:13:15
eating/sleep problems 

00:13:15
DR. ALISON WOOD - teenage behavior, it is important to check whether this is by choice or habit or because he or she cannot get to sleep. Family stresses including unemployment, bereavement, separation, and other life events such as births, may often play an important role. Very often, as a G.P., you will already know the family and their circumstances. Perhaps, you are already treating other family members, like Andrew's mom. Mrs. Wilson was currently being treated for depression. 

00:13:45
family history of mental illness 

00:13:45
DR. ALISON WOOD But past history of mental illness is also an important warning sign. A history of adversity is also relevant. 

00:13:55
adversity eg attack/bullying 

00:13:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Since a young person who's been subject to threats or attacks is vulnerable to depression. This may have been a single instant or a longer term pattern, as with Sophie. Sophie had been subject to prolonged bullying at school. In Sophie's case, this is all, this had also affected her friendship patterns. A child's social relationships provide important clues to their mental well-being. 

00:14:20
social isolation 

00:14:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Look out for the adolescent who has no friends or whose parents complain about him or her spending a lot of time alone in the bedroom. In Andrew's case, his mother also suspected that he was using solvents up in his bedroom. In this age group, drug or solvent abuse is usually a social past time. Taking drugs alone is unusual and hence, it calls for extra concern. 

00:14:40
WARNING SIGNS: unexplained pains frequent attendance eating/sleep problems family stress family history of mental illness adversity (eg attack/bullying) social isolation taking drugs alone 

00:14:40
DR. ALISON WOOD  We'll now look at the assessment of adolescents whom you suspect may be depressed. First, Dr. John Miller and Prof. Harrington discuss some practical matters. 

00:15:10
DR. JOHN MILLER Depression is uhm, a common, ah, part of our job. It probably occupies 30 percent of the time ah, depression and stress and anxiety related problems. Do we approach adolescents and young adults in a different way? 

00:15:25
RICHARD HARRINGTON I think the, the ah, the general approach is very similar to that with, with adults uhm, ah, adolescents over the age of 12 or 13 can be interviewed in much the same way as adults. Uhm, there are few differences. Very often adolescents won't know why they've been brought to the surgery. (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON  Sometimes their moms or dads won't explain to them and ah, they'll be surprised if you start to take a mental state straight away. So it's important to find out what they think the reason for coming is. It's really important to interview the adolescents alone- 

00:15:55
Interview the young person alone 

00:15:55
RICHARD HARRINGTON - uhm, as you would with an adult. I know, in, in some practices it's felt to be difficult to interview adolescents particularly girls. 

00:16:05
DR. ALISON WOOD At individual interview, it's important to take a full history which will include an assessment of urgency. This is mainly about suicide risk. This is rare, most cases will not be urgent and eight out of ten cases will not present a serious suicide risk. For those cases who do, urgent referral will be necessary. This raises some important issues. 

00:16:30
DR. JOHN MILLER Talking about uhm, suicide with anybody is very difficult at the best of times. We find it even more difficult with young people, uhm, are we safe to talk about taking life? 

00:16:45
RICHARD HARRINGTON Yes, yes. Many young people, ah, relieved, particularly very suicidal young people to talk about the feelings that they've had. The very uhm, familiar distressing feelings that they get. And they'll often feel ah, a sense of relief at actually being able to talk about it. There's ah, no evidence it does any harm. It often can do some good. So, it's important. 

00:17:05
DR. ALISON WOOD  Now, let's watch Professor Richard Harrington interviewing Mrs. Wilson's son, Andrew, who's been referred to the Child Psychiatry Department. 

00:17:15
RICHARD HARRINGTON Well, hello, Andrew. How are you? Do you know why you've come to see me? Did your mom, or, okay. Your doctor bring me a letter that said that your mom and he were quite worried about you. You've been feeling sad and, and being yourself, spending a lot of time in your room. 

00:17:35
ANDREW WILSON No one, always about me. 

00:17:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON Is that right? You look very tired now and poorly. Are you feeling tired? How long has that been for? 

00:17:45
ANDREW WILSON Quite awhile now. 

00:17:45
RICHARD HARRINGTON Uh hmm. Is that for weeks or months? 

00:17:50
ANDREW WILSON Months. 

00:17:50
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. When did you last feel well? 

00:17:55
ANDREW WILSON I can't remember. 

00:17:55
RICHARD HARRINGTON Long time ago? All right. You've been feeling sad too? 

00:18:00
ANDREW WILSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
RICHARD HARRINGTON For about the same length of time? 

00:18:00
ANDREW WILSON  Yeah. 

00:18:05
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. And have you had any other kinds of feelings or symptoms or problems? 

00:18:10
ANDREW WILSON I don't got any friends. 

00:18:10
RICHARD HARRINGTON No friends at all? Uhm, not at school or, all right. 

00:18:15
ANDREW WILSON  They've all left me. 

00:18:20
RICHARD HARRINGTON Have they? Why've they done that? 

00:18:20
ANDREW WILSON I don't know. 

00:18:20
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. It sounds as if you think that nobody likes you, certainly. You've been feeling very down? All right. Have you felt so down that you want to harm yourself or take your own life? 

00:18:35
ANDREW WILSON I felt like jumping off a bridge before. 

00:18:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON Really? 

00:18:40
ANDREW WILSON But I just can't do it. 

00:18:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON Really? Did you actually go to a bridge? 

00:18:40
ANDREW WILSON I went to the bridge a couple of nights ago. 

00:18:45
RICHARD HARRINGTON My goodness! And, and what happened? 

00:18:45
ANDREW WILSON I stood up on the edge but I just couldn't jump off. I thought my mom would worry too much. 

00:18:55
RICHARD HARRINGTON Gosh! And you're still feeling like that now? All right. And how long have you been feeling like that for? 

00:19:00
ANDREW WILSON  For about three weeks now. 

00:19:05
RICHARD HARRINGTON My goodness! It has been on your mind for a lot of the time? 

00:19:05
ANDREW WILSON  Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
RICHARD HARRINGTON Gosh. And has feeling like this affected you in other ways, for example, physically? Uhm. 

00:19:15
ANDREW WILSON I don't wanna want to play sports like I used to before. 

00:19:20
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right, all right. How's your sleeping? 

00:19:20
ANDREW WILSON  I hardly sleep at all now. 

00:19:25
RICHARD HARRINGTON Really. What, what time do you usually go to bed? 

00:19:25
ANDREW WILSON  I go to bed about ten o'clock but I don't get to sleep. 

00:19:30
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. And what time do you wake up if you do get off? 

00:19:35
ANDREW WILSON About lunchtime. 

00:19:35
RICHARD HARRINGTON Really, all right. And how about your appetite? How's that been? 

00:19:40
ANDREW WILSON I can't eat. 

00:19:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. What about school work? How's that been affected? 

00:19:45
ANDREW WILSON I just can't think with concentration and my head is spinning around. 

00:19:50
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right, all right. Have you been getting behind with your work too? 

00:19:55
ANDREW WILSON I'm about two years behind, I've been with it. 

00:19:55
RICHARD HARRINGTON  My goodness. It's a lot. That's a lot. 

00:20:00
ANDREW WILSON Uh hmm. My mom don't know that. 

00:20:00
RICHARD HARRINGTON Is that right? Is it difficult to talk to your mom about these things? (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
ANDREW WILSON Uh hmm. Yeah. She don't understand like my dad used to. 

00:20:05
RICHARD HARRINGTON  All right. Tell me a bit about how you're getting along with your mom. 

00:20:10
ANDREW WILSON  Ah, my mom makes me feel as though she don't care about me. 

00:20:15
RICHARD HARRINGTON  All right. Does she say bad things to you? 

00:20:20
ANDREW WILSON  No. Not all the time but sometimes she does. 

00:20:25
RICHARD HARRINGTON Uh hmm. And how about your dad? 

00:20:30
ANDREW WILSON My dad, I haven't seen him now. 

00:20:30
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. Why's that? 

00:20:30
ANDREW WILSON  I don't know. 

00:20:35
RICHARD HARRINGTON  Do you have any brothers and sisters? 

00:20:40
ANDREW WILSON No. 

00:20:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. It sounds like you feel terribly lonely about it. 

00:20:45
ANDREW WILSON I am. 

00:20:45
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. All right. Do you ever get attacks of fear or panic when you suddenly feel very frightened? All right. How often are you having those? 

00:20:55
ANDREW WILSON Like once every three days I normally have one. 

00:21:00
RICHARD HARRINGTON Right, right. And when you get by that, can you go to school or do you have to stay in? 

00:21:05
ANDREW WILSON No. I just stay on the bedroom and lie down. 

00:21:05
RICHARD HARRINGTON I see. 

00:21:05
ANDREW WILSON  Hoping that will go away. 

00:21:10
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. Have you, sometimes when people feel like this, they do things like sniff glue or drink something like that to make themselves feel better. Have you been doing that, Andrew? 

00:21:20
ANDREW WILSON  Yes. 

00:21:25
RICHARD HARRINGTON Uh hmm. What kinds of things do you, do you take? 

00:21:25
ANDREW WILSON  I sniff aerosols and solvent. 

00:21:30
RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. And how often do you do that? 

00:21:30
ANDREW WILSON  Nearly every night. 

00:21:35
RICHARD HARRINGTON Do you? And where do you do that? 

00:21:35
ANDREW WILSON  In the bedroom. 

00:21:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. Is that, on your own? I guess. Okay. And you feel, well, how does that make you feel? 

00:21:45
ANDREW WILSON It take things off my mind for a bit but then everything comes back and hits me. 

00:21:50
RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. It sounds to me you've had quite a lot of problems over the last few weeks. Would you be interested in coming up here to talk to somebody about them? And having some treatment, of course, ah, I'm not talking their minds about, ah, medical treatments like medication but see if we can find somebody to talk with you, to talk some of these things over and try to make you feel a bit better. 

00:22:10
ANDREW WILSON Yeah. 

00:22:10
RICHARD HARRINGTON Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
DR. ALISON WOOD The interview with Andrew, illustrates some important risk factors for completed suicide which you need to be alert to. At risk factors for adolescent suicide: serious suicidal ideation, severe depression, previous suicide attempt, males, drug and solvent abuse, disorganised family, emotional or sexual abuse, lack of a confiding relationship. A seriously suicidal youngster will usually have thought about a method, and may indeed, have made quite detailed plans. Although this is not common, it is important that you refer such cases urgently to specialist, as you should with anyone whom you regard to be at risk. 

00:23:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Having watched Professor Harrington's assessment, we now return to Louise Williams who we previously saw in surgery with her mother, receiving the results of her blood tests. 

00:23:20
LOUISE POLLITT  I just feel like my life's going nowhere. I've. (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
DR. JOHN MILLER How are you feeling inside? 

00:23:30
Enquires about mood 

00:23:30
DR. JOHN MILLER How do you feel inside yourself, how are you in spirits? 

00:23:30
LOUISE POLLITT Low. 

00:23:30
DR. JOHN MILLER  Low. 

00:23:35
LOUISE POLLITT Very low. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
DR. JOHN MILLER How low do you feel? Tell me more about the way you feel. 

00:23:35
LOUISE POLLITT Well, you know, I've, I keep getting headaches, (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
LOUISE POLLITT soon it pains, and that's making me even more, just down. 

00:23:45
Biological symptoms 

00:23:45
LOUISE POLLITT I get drowsy and weak and I feel like I've got an ongoing flu all the time. 

00:23:50
DR. JOHN MILLER How do you feel energy-wise? Do you feel full of energy or do you feel tired or. 

00:23:55
LOUISE POLLITT I feel, I feel lack of energy... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
LOUISE POLLITT ...everyday. 

00:23:55
DR. JOHN MILLER And how about your thinking? How's thinking at home, sort of, uhm, shopping, and ah,- 

00:24:00
Concentration 

00:24:00
DR. JOHN MILLER - reading, and doing your homework, has a. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
LOUISE POLLITT Can't do any of that because when I try, it's like it's no good because I just can't think of read and I can't read because the concentration is not that good anyway. 

00:24:15
DR. JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
LOUISE POLLITT At school, it's just, well school is just a nightmare. 

00:24:20
DR. JOHN MILLER Would people notice the way you feel at school and do you think outsiders know how you feel inside? 

00:24:25
LOUISE POLLITT  My friends, they don't, they don't know how I, I feel inside. But they know that I'm, I'm miserable. 

00:24:35
DR. JOHN MILLER All right. Would you feel so low that you get tearful? 

00:24:35
LOUISE POLLITT  Yeah, I'm always crying. 

00:24:40
DR. JOHN MILLER Always crying. Is that absolutely every hour or everyday or just once a week or? 

00:24:45
LOUISE POLLITT Every hour. 

00:24:45
DR. JOHN MILLER Every hour. So are you, are you feeling low most of the time, throughout say, an average week, are you low most of the time? 

00:24:55
Explores suicidal feelings 

00:24:55
LOUISE POLLITT Close. Most of the time and the, I've even tried power seed smokes(ph), but, I was gonna try power seed smokes(ph) but (inaudible ) 

00:25:07
DR. JOHN MILLER You mean, you've actually felt like, life is... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
LOUISE POLLITT Ending it all? Yeah. 

00:25:10
DR. JOHN MILLER ...not worth living? Tell me what happened then. That must have been a horrible feeling for you. 

00:25:10
LOUISE POLLITT  Well, it is. 

00:25:15
Recognition Assessment Management 

00:25:15
ALISON WOOD In this section, we have described how to assess adolescents in the context of a busy G.P. surgery and summarized the main risk factors for completed suicide, which require urgent referral. We now move on to management. The management of child and adolescent depression tends to be different from adult depression, and that drugs are much less commonly used. Let's hear Professor Richard Harrington's views. 

00:25:40
RICHARD HARRINGTON Evidence of the minorities that drugs, antidepressant drugs, are less effective in adolescents with ah, depression, than they are in adults. There are some indications for ah, using medication with adolescents. Uhm, the first would be when other treatments have failed. And the second will be, I think, particularly severe depressions with ah, biological features. Depressions that look very like adult depressions in older adolescents. I think if then it is appropriate for antidepressants to be the first-line treatment. But in middle and early adolescents, the first-line treatments are usually psychological, in one way or another. The kind of treatment given would depend very much on the presenting problem and that might be fam, difficulties in the family, difficulties in the school, and simple measures that are targeted at relieving these, whichever stress is thought to be relevant, often be very effective in 50 to 60 percent of cases. 

00:26:35
ALISON WOOD To summarize the use of medication for young people with depressive disorders in general practice. Research evidence for the efficacy of Tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of depressive disorders in young people is weak. This research is at an early stage. However, there is limited evidence in favor of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group, the SSRIs. 

00:27:00
Poorly tolerated 

00:27:00
ALISON WOOD Antidepressant medication is not well tolerated by young people. Due to their safety, we believe that the SSRI group should be the drug of first choice in general practice. More research in this area is needed. Indications for prescribing antidepressants in general practice include the following: biological depression, i.e. those- 

00:27:25
INDICATIONS 

00:27:25
ALISON WOOD - young people who present with a clinical picture- 

00:27:30
"Biological" depression 

00:27:30
ALISON WOOD - resembling adult depression with symptoms of sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, diurnal variation of mood, and accompanying agitation or retardation. Older adolescents and depression of moderate severity. 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:50
ALISON WOOD  The important message is that there are a number of things a G.P. can do. And many cases will respond fully to such measures without the need for referral to a specialist. Management should be individual and problem-oriented. Approaches may include the following. 

00:28:20
GP MANAGEMENT OF ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION 

00:28:20
ALISON WOOD  Follow up appointments. Follow up appointments will allow you to monitor the situation and offer support and encouragement to the youngster. Monitoring between appointments. In between appointments, it is often helpful to ask the adolescent to keep some sort of record or diary of their moods and feelings. This can be in the form of a simple chart or questionnaire. This not only provides a monitoring device but is also useful in detecting patterns and for helping the young person to hang on to good feelings, a useful reminder on bad days. Advice. It maybe appropriate to offer advice on a presenting problem and about other sources of support. Liaison. Other agencies may be able to help with the problem. So, liaison becomes important. School and school health services play a significant role in the lives of this age group and this is often helpful to involve them, particularly for school related problems. Involving parents and carers. Finally, don't forget to work closely with the parents or carers. Inform them of the risks of attempted suicide and educate them about simple measures such as secure storage of medicines. We've heard from Professor Harrington how the first-line treatments are psychological. Let's now hear about the range of approaches on offer in child psychiatry clinics. 

00:29:50
RICHARD HARRINGTON In our outpatient clinics, we'd be using various kinds of counseling, and the so-called "cognitive treatments" that you mentioned earlier. These are treatments that aim to try and change a young person's way of thinking about the world. Many depressed young people suffer from very intense feelings of ah, low self-esteem. They feel they're very useless. And that commonly leads on to depression. So, cognitive therapies which could be done very quickly in outpatient departments of ah, five or six sessions is usually enough. Ah, aim at changing a young person's ah, style of relating and style of ah, perceiving the world, and hence, to alleviate symptoms of depression. And they're very effective in two-thirds of cases. 

00:30:30
JOHN MILLER How does that differ from behavioral therapy? 

00:30:35
RICHARD HARRINGTON Behavioral therapy tends to target observable aspects of behavior more than styles of thinking. So they(ph) create(ph), behavioral therapies include a set of techniques, ah, such as increasing levels of activity. Many depressed young people are very inactive... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
RICHARD HARRINGTON ...socially withdrawn. So, behavioral therapy would aim to encourage the young person to become more active again. For example, using things like setting simple targets each week, keeping diaries and things like that. And another important component of behavioral therapy would be social skills training. Many depressed young people, uhm, ah, lack basic social skills. They have difficulties making friendships and that makes them particularly vulnerable to depression. So, one of the ideas behind some of the behavioral therapies particularly those that focus on social skills training, will be to increase ah, a young person's ability to relate to other people. To make friends and to maintain friendships that by hopefully conferring them a longer term protective effect. 

00:31:30
ALISON WOOD Most treatments are offered on an outpatient basis. And only in rare circumstances, do we need to consider admission and inpatient treatment. So what if those cases you feel do need to be referred to a child psychiatrist? 

00:31:45
JOHN MILLER Parents are looking for reassurance. They will be looking for uhm, pe, pediatric opinion or a surgical opinion on the abdomen, uhm, "How can you help us around this?" We know it's difficult, uhm, to make the diagnosis and you'll practically say ah, "Somebody has a peptic ulcer." Uhm, the other problem is, as well, some people have both problems. They may have an ulcer and depression. Uhm, "Do you still, do, do you suggest that we continue to refer to pediatricians, or should we be thinking more referring to people like yourself?" 

00:32:15
RICHARD HARRINGTON It probably depends on the parent and the child's attitudes. Some parents would be very, very resistant, ah, and certainly early on to a psychological explanation for their child's problems. Sometimes if you just give them a psychological explanation, they won't come back. 

00:32:30
JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
RICHARD HARRINGTON And you may make things worse. In those kind of instances, I'd recommend referring to a pediatrician but perhaps in your referral letter indicating, uhm, that you feel there may be a psychological component too. Pediatricians will appreciate that as a very familiar presentation to them, of course; young people with headaches, abdominal pain, who, who also have co-existing depression. Parents are often then reassured, as is the adolescent themselves, that the physical side of things has been looked at. And then are better able to, uhm, count it as a psychological explanation and... (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
RICHARD HARRINGTON ...possibly, even psychological treatment. 

00:33:00
JOHN MILLER  When should we refer to you in a hospital unit? And how does a G.P. go about that? 

00:33:05
RICHARD HARRINGTON  Uhm, the main, the cases we had referred tend to be the more severe ones. Ah, the ones we like to see are ones where there's significant impairment, where the, the depression is really affecting young person's life. There are a few emergency situations. The main one, of course, is where this serious suicidal behavior. 

00:33:25
JOHN MILLER Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
RICHARD HARRINGTON It's very important that somebody's referred rapidly, then, particularly if the young person is talking of, uhm, plans for, for example very serious suicidal attempts. 

00:33:35
ALISON WOOD  To summarize, the main indications for referral are- 

00:33:40
CRITERIA FOR REFERRAL 

00:33:40
ALISON WOOD  high suicide risk, significant impairment, high levels of hopelessness, lack of response to simple measures. To conclude, depression is a significant problem and is likely to be encountered by G.P.s in their everyday clinical practice. An effective assessment can be conducted within your surgery. And it's also, always important to interview the child or adolescent alone. Children tend to present less typically than adults with depression, but adolescents tend to present very similarly to adults with depressive disorders. And in fact, the management is also similar. As part of the assessment, it's very important to assess suicide risk. And for those few cases which are urgent, a referral needs to be made to the local child psychiatry service. Most cases, however, will not be urgent, and can be managed effectively by a G.P. in a primary health care setting. We hope you found-
