EFT with A Traumatized Couple April 2011 

00:00:05
SUE JOHNSON And you says some incredibly powerful thing you say, I got up-- I get upset because, uhm, I'm hearing, what, I'm hearing a message that you help me here, I'm hearing message that I'm disappointing her, is that it? Am I getting it right? 

00:00:20
MATT That's right. I'm disappointing her yes, yes. 

00:00:20
Video clip from the DVD "EFT in Action" with Sue Johnson 

00:00:20
SUE JOHNSON Okay, so I'm hearing that I'm disappointing her and, and then there's thought comes in as, but I'm doing the best I can. I'm doing the best I can and somehow, what? I-- somehow I'm dealing with so much here when you turn and tell me that I'm disappointing you, I'm dealing with so much here some part of me just wants to go off into my cave, some part of me says I'm dealing with so much. I just don't know how to turn and actually turn into you and give you what you want. Am I getting it? You help me. 

00:01:05
MATT You are getting it. The, the, the term dealing with it may not best describe it. It's more like I don't really understand it myself I, I you know, I'm a fixer. I can fix a lot of things and I know how to deal with a lot of problems but to this I don't understand why I don't want to have intimacy with my wife or I don't understand why my sex drive was super low and that turns into me as I can't fix it. I don't understand what's going on here, uhm, so I'm just going to retreat to my cave or get angry and flip it unto her, just flip it unto her and say, okay, you want me I'm just gonna be angry about this and blot I'm gonna pick on you then. 

00:01:50
SUE JOHNSON Okay, okay, so help me hear, guys, all right. This is a good stuff. 

00:01:50
MATT Uhm-huh. 

00:01:55
SUE JOHNSON All right. So what you're telling me is the dance you get caught in is you feel like you never show you're really important, you're hungering for more connection with your partner, right, and there's tension between the two of you, you both worried about getting into this fights. You, ah, say something to him, you get angry the spills out of you, you hear that she's disappointed, right, and you're in this confused state where you don't really understand what's going on but your instinct is that you're trying the best you can. It somehow my senses this is overwhelming somehow, you don't really understand what's going on and some part of your brain says there's only one-- I don't know how to fix this, there's only one way out of this. What I'm gonna do is I just wanna go off into my cave com-- we talk about compartmentalizing is a real skill you learned in the military. 

00:02:50
MATT Yeah. 

00:02:50
SUE JOHNSON Right? That saved your life a thousand times in the military. 

00:02:50
MATT Yes. 

00:02:50
SUE JOHNSON That ability to compartmentalize, right? 

00:02:55
MATT Yeah. 

00:02:55
SUE JOHNSON Okay. 

00:02:55
MATT Yeah. 

00:02:55
SUE JOHNSON So it's natural that that's a place you go. You say I'm gonna shutdown and move away and go in my cave. Tricky part about that when there's of course when you do that she's gonna feel shutout, right? Or you say, the other way of dealing with it when I hear that I'm disappointing is-- the other way you do is to fight. 

00:03:15
MATT Mmm-mm. Yeah. 

00:03:15
SUE JOHNSON Is to say, no you're wrong. 

00:03:20
MATT You know, flip it over. 

00:03:20
SUE JOHNSON You're wrong. You shouldn't-- I'm gonna flip it. You're wrong and... 

00:03:20
RHEA It's not me, its you. 

00:03:25
SUE JOHNSON It's not me, it's you. So we have a fight about who it is, right? 

00:03:25
MATT Yes. Right. 

00:03:30
SUE JOHNSON Who's the bad guy here? 

00:03:30
MATT Right. 

00:03:30
SUE JOHNSON Okay. 

00:03:30
MATT Yeah, exactly. 

00:03:30
SUE JOHNSON But, in fact, there's really no bad guy. You both caught in this dreadful dance and you're both hurting. 

00:03:35
MATT Mmm-mm. 

00:03:35
SUE JOHNSON So you flip it and I just want to stay with the dance for a minute then I want to come back and talk about your feelings - 

00:03:40
MATT Uh-huh. 

00:03:40
SUE JOHNSON - cuz you're saying, I don't understand them, yeah? 

00:03:45
MATT Mmm-mm. 

00:03:45
SUE JOHNSON So, you-- if you flip it-- and so if he withdraws or flips into anger which is the only way he knows how to deal with that message from you he's disappointing you, what do you do? What's the next step in the dance? What do you do then? 

00:04:00
RHEA Well, the last couple times it got a little ugly, it got a little physical and that kinda scared me so there's-- so the couple nights ago when we got into it I just tried to just stop. I tried-- I said, I don't want to try anymore, I don't wanna do this, I'm not gonna get into this, I wanna go to bed and he pursued me and I mean, first-- little came looking to like ke-- keep getting into it to keep getting into this fight, uhm, so it depends on what the situation is. Sometimes I feel like my points are very valid. I'm going to... 

00:04:35
SUE JOHNSON So, so hang with me, hang with me. Sometimes you'll spot you, you help me. I'm hearing sometimes you'll stand and fight cuz you already want to be heard. You don't wanna be, you don't be... 

00:04:40
RHEA Yes, because I won't believe it. I don't believe this that you can actually sit down there and tell me that this is a problem and then I did this and this and this and all the while all this over here is not going on. There is nothing here that is filling up any good part of me. 

00:04:55
SUE JOHNSON Right, right. 

00:04:55
RHEA And you're gonna actually criticizes part of me. 

00:05:00
SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:05:00
RHEA So, how... 

00:05:00
SUE JOHNSON So you're saying, uhm, I am standing here all by myself needing your reassurance that you love me and now you turn and, and criticize me I can't bear it and I want you to hear that I can't bear it. So you'll stand in fight, right? But now, you're saying "Actually, Sue, no. sometimes I'm getting really scared that I might getting to a physical fights so I'm starting to withdraw." 

00:05:20
RHEA Because it is not gonna get anywhere and that's what I'm realizing - 

00:05:25
SUE JOHNSON So your.... 

00:05:25
RHEA - it don't get anywhere. Now he has his opinions, I had my opinions. I know what I feel is right. I'm sure he has what he thinks is right. 

00:05:30
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:05:30
RHEA Or maybe he doesn't but I just can't win. 

00:05:30
SUE JOHNSON So you'd say, it's... 

00:05:35
RHEA I cannot get that point across. There is no, you know what Rhea, I'm sorry if you feel that way or I don't know what to tell you but I love you. There is no, there is no diffusing statement. It's always - 

00:05:45
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:05:50
RHEA - about me. 

00:05:50
SUE JOHNSON Right. And so, you end up feeling so hurt and you feel hopeless and there's no way out and so you start to choose shutdown and walk out too, right? 

00:05:55
RHEA Yup. You know, I know I'm not that way. I'm not, ah, I don't, I don't do that, that's not my way. I would like to face things, I like getting it out. I am a fixer also. 

00:06:05
SUE JOHNSON Can you, can you hear where the-- where we goes with this that she goes with that sense of hopelessness that she can't reach you, right, and so she moves away. What's it's like for you that she starts to move away? 

00:06:20
MATT I don't think she moves away. She doesn't move away. It's just crescendos. 

00:06:25
RHEA Inside me. 

00:06:25
MATT It just escalates, it just escalates. I'm not seeing what's inside her. 

00:06:25
SUE JOHNSON Okay, I guess, what I'm saying is how does it end up, guys? Do you just decide-- do you just get too exhausted to fight? How does it end up this dance? Did just somehow somebody gets tired and falls asleep or somebody walks away or how do you bring it to a close? 

00:06:40
RHEA So the other day he ripped that sheets of the-- of the bed and took them into the other extra room and went-- let me get another sheets and that's how it ended. 

00:06:50
MATT We're just retreat to... 

00:06:50
SUE JOHNSON You retreat. You both retreat. You have a Clash of the Titans everyone feels hopeless. I'm presuming you feel hopeless in that moment too, do you? 

00:07:00
MATT Yeah, totally. 

00:07:00
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So both of you feel hopeless, right? You caught up in this so dreadful firefight, right, trying to prove well you know, it's your fault, right, I'm not the wrong and then, and then, there's a retreat and then what? There is sort of force and then it will starts up again? 

00:07:15
RHEA We get up in the morning and we have to go to work and I went to work and so I go our needs to get ready and... 

00:07:20
SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:07:20
RHEA We use to get our thing. 

00:07:20
MATT Yeah, then, then... 

00:07:25
SUE JOHNSON The next piece hang on. 

00:07:30
MATT I don't know how to come back to you and say afterwards this is, this is how-- if I knew how to do that - 

00:07:35
RHEA No, we used to do that. 

00:07:35
MATT - then I would do that. If I knew how to do that I would do that. 

00:07:40
RHEA We used to do that better, both of us I, I mean... 

00:07:40
MATT We used to-- it's exactly the problem. 

00:07:40
SUE JOHNSON You guys are gonna be able to do that again. I want, I want you to hear what he said Rhea cuz what he said, are you with me? I want you to really taste what he say. He said, it's not that I don't love you Rhea all with your heart to love it's that in that moment when I'm overwhelmed I just-- I'm-- I don't use the word pa-- that's the word my word ma-- maybe paralyze is not the right word, I'm just so caught with landing the helicopter I'm so panic that was my word to. You, you help me within I'm just on such emergency mode that I'm caught in that and I just don't know what to do in that moment I'm caught, I'm paralyzed. 

00:08:35
RHEA It feels like that, I'm sorry. 

00:08:40
MATT We, we called it immediate action item in the helicopter room so one grained and trained that you just switch that immediate action item it doesn't take conscious thought it just happens. 

00:08:55
SUE JOHNSON I hear you. 

00:09:00
MATT To twist it back on, you know, to restart the engine and make sure the gears down. 

00:09:00
SUE JOHNSON I hear you and, and, and I want-- and I just want to say something here okay. I'm gonna change modes slightly, please forgive me. I hear you and when I want to say to you this every vet I've ever worked with is that I hear you and the way I understand that is for you to survive in those situations you trained your brain, you trained your brain and that sort of an incredibly beautiful phrase in immediate action item. You trained your brain to respond to emergency and danger in a particular way and unfortunately Matt, when you come home stateside your conscious turn that off, yeah? 

00:09:45
MATT Yeah. 

00:09:45
SUE JOHNSON That's right. Your conscious turns that off. So when this lady when you hear that this lady is disappointed in you and you say, oh my god, we're gonna get into that war that Clash of the Titans again and I don't know how to fix it and maybe I'm gonna lose the only real copilot I've ever had you know, that's danger and your brain goes into immediate action item and there's only two things land the dammed helicopter going to the cave or fight like hell. 

00:10:20
MATT Yeah. 

00:10:20
SUE JOHNSON And you're in action mode so then she turns and says, how come you talk tell me you love me and it's like she's talking about being at the bottom of the mountain your fighting for your life on the top. You're in a whole different place. 

00:10:30
MATT Yeah, yeah, totally. 

00:10:35
SUE JOHNSON And you don't know how to do it but the irony is actually it's dangerous because she matter so much to you if she didn't matte to you, you wouldn't be trying to-- you wouldn't be in immediate action item, would you? 

00:10:45
MATT Right. 

00:10:45
SUE JOHNSON I hear you. So you get stuck in the panic, my goodness, this man can't respond to me right now maybe he really doesn't love me, maybe I'm even hard to love, maybe he doesn't love me, he's so shutdown, right, and you get angry, right, and try reach him. You hear she's disappointed in you. You go into shutting down or get or fighting back what's happening for you here is that you're overwhelmed with all this. You're overwhelmed and you're going to immediate action item and that is usually emotional shutdown and if I mean, emotional shutdown then you say to me, hey Sue, can you find your feelings of love with me. I'm like, uhm, no, I'm dancing a waltz sorry I don't know how to shift to polka. I'm, I'm, ah, what? 

00:11:40
MATT Mmm-mm. 

00:11:40
SUE JOHNSON I'm busy landing the helicopter, right? 

00:11:40
MATT Mmm-mm. 

00:11:40
SUE JOHNSON You're in fight of-- fight of-- fight or freeze, yes? 

00:11:50
MATT Yup. 

00:11:50
SUE JOHNSON That's also happening for you? 

00:11:50
MATT Yeah. 

00:11:50
SUE JOHNSON But what I'm hearing is right here, right now when we're talking about this and I'm helping you put it together you can turn to your lady and say, you know what Rhea I do love you and I don't wanna lose my copilot I'm just caught in this dreadful place by the time we get to this place where you say, how come you just can't reach for me. I'm caught in immediate action item. I'm overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. 

00:12:20
MATT But I think Rhea believes in this place. I think she thinks it's an excuse. 

00:12:25
SUE JOHNSON Well, hang on. Well-- okay, hang on. That's, that's just to hear for a minute cuz we cover a lot of ground I wanna be here. Am I got it right? 

00:12:30
MATT Yeah. 

00:12:30
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So for you... 

00:12:30
MATT It's kinda hard for me. 

00:12:35
SUE JOHNSON So can you tell her cuz it's different coming from me. Can you tell her, Rhea I hear that you need that reassurance but in that moment I'm caught in immediate action item and I don't know what to do I'm overwhelmed. Can you tell her that? 

00:12:50
MATT I hear that you need me but I'm caught in this cycle that I can't break out of, I don't know, I don't know what to do. I used to know what to do for us and with us but, ah, it's different now. It's just - 

00:13:10
SUE JOHNSON I'm overwhelmed. 

00:13:10
MATT - I'm overwhelmed. It's not just us it's everything and my life. 

00:13:15
SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:13:15
MATT And I'm overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. 

00:13:20
SUE JOHNSON And I'm so scared in that moment that I'm gonna lose you that's the bit that I think maybe is important. 

00:13:25
MATT Yeah, I'm scared that I am gonna lose you. It's not just because another divorce it's because of our relationship I love you and we've been tremendous amount of angst together but can't I not know. 

00:13:40
SUE JOHNSON Okay, so, uhm, that was a difficult couple in lots of ways but what he's talking about is I'm helping him talk about the battle goes on inside of him and how consuming it is and how he's experiencing danger everywhere and she becomes a danger cue as well and when you get caught up in that huge tossed of affect regulation you literally have a very hard time looking across and relating to your partner. My friend Jim Cone(ph) puts it literally he says, you just don't have enough glucose going to your brain to do both and I don't know if that's true but I like it, okay, so I'm turned. But-- so what I'm doing is helping him talk explicitly about all the stuff that's going on inside him how he is struggling to regulate his emotion and it's because he loves us so much he so scared to lose her, right and I'm helping her hear that. What I want you to understand is there's a highly escalated trauma couple what I want you to know is they were very hard work and they did just fine in the EFT but part of the difficulty is just like a regular couple every time he shuts down to deal with his emotions he shuts her out and when he shuts her out he creates panic in her and then they just off to the races. So this is me working a little bit, you've seen a little bit of what I do. I'm working very hard. One of the reasons I'm speaking so much is because if I stop for a minute her anxiety comes in like, uhm, a tidal wave and takes over the session, okay, and I'd like you to notice to the-- sometimes I have to touch her to calm her down. I touch her a lot in this video to keep her with me because she-- if you listen to her voice and see what she does with her hands she's massively agitated. So this is a brief thing, so I'm just going to flip very quickly in a rather strange way to a YouTube clip but gives you feel for what the opposite of what you've just seen what we want to create in our couples and especially in our trauma couples. This is a beautiful YouTube clip okay.

00:17:30
SUE JOHNSON I love that. And basically what that-- it does so clever because it uses our basic resonance with attachment to teach us a lesson but what we're really talking to survive is about is that yes other people can be dangerous but the bottom line is the only real seat belt we ever have is the love of other people so that's what we're trying to help them move into and reach for and experience, uhm, EFT when we're working with trauma survivors. Thank you.
