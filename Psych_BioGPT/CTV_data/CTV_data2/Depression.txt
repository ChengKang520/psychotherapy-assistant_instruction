MICHAEL MUNION Good morning please find your seats, we're ready to begin. Ah, my name is Michael Munion. I'm your moderator today and, ah, we're here for a very interesting panel on depression. Ah, we have three leading experts that we could wanna hear from this morning. Ah, we have Jon Carlson who is a distinguished professor of psychology at Governors State University. We have, ah, Christine Padesky who is the cofounder of the center for cognitive therapy and Huntington Beach, ah, California right down the road. Ah, and we have, Michael Yapko who's internationally recognized, ah, for his work and applications for clinical hypnosis, author of 12 books. Ah, first speaker this morning will be Jon Carlson.

00:00:50
JON CARLSON Ah, you know, I was kinda hoping I was gonna be one of the last people but that's okay. 

00:00:50
MICHAEL MUNION It's all right. 

00:00:55
JON CARLSON Ah, you know, I, I've do-- I do a lot of therapy and I've worked a lot with depression, and what would I f-- you know, found out is that a lot of my depression interventions don't work. Uhm, so that, that's why I'm a perfect candidate, ah, for this talk. Ah, the guys who's you know, techniques and strategies don't work with depression. You know, I've tried medicine, you know, I've tried therapy and just nothing seems to work. Ah, and, and then I've realized most of the time the people that I work with don't have what's called depression even though we tend to treat people for depression very, very quickly. What I found is that loneliness is often misdiagnosed depression. Ah, recent report from the Harvard Medical dichool-- School describes loneliness as a very real little disgust social epidemic with frightening consequences. And believe it or not, old people aren't the lonely people, it's other folks. People young, people old are experiencing loneliness at an alarming rate. Ah, you know, it's, it's-- is would saying in Mid West, it's as common as acorns . Fortunately, there's five steps that you can take, and will leave you these five steps. And if you follow these five steps you can alleviate loneliness, and what people called depression. Ah, and it's also gonna increase the happiness and the contentment in your own life, and they seem deceptively simple. The first one is you have to figure out who you are, and, and most of us you know, we don't know who we are. Sounds like the simple question, who are you? We say, I'm a mom, or I'm a dad or, I'm a therapist but that's just the role. Who are you really? Ah, it's important to list three characteristics that represents your values, who are you really deeply? Once you've listed your core values, ah, you can begin to practice these core values, like if you wanna be known as a kind person if that's what you're saying, I'm a kind person. Ah, then make sure you exhibit kindness everyday. Ah, you know, you need to act out these core values and that's gonna make you feel better about yourself. And it's also gonna draw other people toward you. The second step is to invest in other people. You know, think about others not just yourself and you know, most of the people we work with they're just too much into their own egos. We all need about three to five people who are close circle of support which will grow when we invest more time and money and energy into them. Connecting through technology doesn't count. There's lots of studies that say, the more you rely on your cell phone, on your computer through face you know, book and so forth, the lonelier you become. Bill Moyers said this years ago, when he said, you know, our children are being raised by appliances and, ah, now today they're adults and they're still depending on appliances. Ah, a third is to get involved in your community. You know, to act globally or to act locally. And you look around here, at the, you know, people on this panel or anther programs, they invest in the communities they live in, they invest time, ah, money, energy in people outside their own social circle. Uhm, step forward would be the channel, your talents and the meaningful work, and work doesn't need to be what you get paid for. But as work, ah, ah, ah, is, is as how we give back you know, to life while we're here. And finally, it, it is-- it's really important to figure out the purposes of your own life. You what are your purposes? You know, Rick Warren is right here in, in this part of the world and he has the Saddleback Church and he had the bestselling book of all times I think called the, ah, some, ah, Drive the Purpose-- sort of Purpose Driven Life you know, and, and, ah, ah, don't, don't buy the book. And there is the title that I think everybody you know, that, that everybody really jumped on to because everyone is searching for some more purpose, for some more meaning, ah, in their own life. Ah, make sure that you're moving toward your life purposes. See, once you can live these core values, you can strengthen your connections then you invest in your community, you apply your talents to meaningful work, you begin living a life of purpose and you're not gonna be lonely again. You know, this doesn't happened a lot to me-- that I have a book out, you might guess the title is called Never Be Lo-- Lonely Again. But just before I left, ah, into the university, a call came into the switchboard. And a lady called in and she said, ah, from s-- she lives in rural Illinois and she said, "I just wanna thank you." And I, I said, "Do I know you?" And she said, "No." She said, "I bought your book, I followed those five steps." It sounds like an infomercial that this is, is true. I mean, it's nice and young. And, ah, she said, "I followed these five steps for the last 30 years I've been diagnosed with chronic depression. I have, ah, that they-- they've even said I have agoraphobia. I've had every medicine under the world. Now, I'm medicine and I'm back on the street just because I followed those five simple steps." So before were-- I know we're gonna talk about depression but I also want you to think about loneliness to as probably the underwriting issue of the people who you might jump at the same depressed. So-- that's all thank you.

MICHAEL MUNION Next, we'll be hearing from Christine Padesky. 

00:07:25
CBT FOR DEPRESSION & SUICIDE BEST PRACTICES Christine A. Padesky, PhD 

00:07:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Good morning. I always think there's a some-- some kind of cruelty between scheduling an eight o'clock meeting and then having the topic be depression. I've actually been teaching, ah, cognitive therapy for depression, ah, which I learned from Dr. Aaron T. Beck. I've been teaching it since 1978 so it's been 35 years. And this is also the year that I turned, ah, 60 so I'm beginning to feel a bit ancient, ah, in, in the field but, ah, I, I have recommendation for good anecdote to that if those of you who are turning milestones, whatever the milestone is that you're beginning to feel your passing a bit. Ah, and that is this spring in April, we went Turkey and if you're feeling you know, that you're a bit old, there's nothing better than to go to a country with lovely antiquities to make yourself real quite young again. Ah, when I-- when we were in Istanbul, we went to a marvelous museum there, archeological museum there and saw these remarkable statues that were sculpted, ah, 358 BC, these crying women and it's a, it's a reminder that depression has been around as part of the human condition probably for as long as human beings have been sentient. Ah, it's quite common, it's been a huge problem and we've not, ah, done a real good job of making a huge dent in it through all of our clinical interventions over the years. Ah, in the past year, I decided to take a fresh look at the literature on depression treatment and I created a new workshop called Best Practices in Treating Depression and Suicide. And I've drawn just a dozen slides from that program to show you today with some of the ideas, ah, that I think would make a difference in your own clinical practice, and do quite a bit of consultation with therapist from around the world. And so I am privileged to get to see the common stock points the therapist run into. So here are some of, ah, my recommendations and ideas for things that you could do to make an immediate difference in your practice and success and working with people who are depressed particularly if you're using cognitive behavioral therapy. 

00:10:00
MEASUREMENT Mood Measures 

00:10:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Ah, the first thing, is measurement. Now, measurement sound very sexy to therapist. But I have to say when I, ah, teach a two-day workshop on this topic I asked people in the audience at the very beginning how much do you get excited about measuring your clients depression. Ah, not many people raise their hands. At the end of the two days, I asked the group, how many you are now enthusiastic to go home and measure depression in your clients on a regular basis. And almost every hand in the audience goes up. And that's because it turns out that measurement is our friend when we're clinicians. Ah, one of the things that we know is helpful for depression is we can track the progress that we're making with people. We can see for interventions are actually making the improvements or not. It's also true that when people come in and who are quite depressed, even when they do improved, they're still feeling depressed. Ah, five, six weeks into the therapy. And, they can get discouraged and say, I'm doing all these things but I still feel depressed. 

00:11:00
Measure Mood â€¢ Track Progress BDI Scores 

00:11:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY If you're actually tracking their depression scores using any measure that you have available whether it's the depression inventory from the Mind Over Mood book that Dennis Greenberger and I wrote or whether it's the Beck Depression Inventory or some other measure. Ah, you can actually with your client look at their scores and see if they're making progress or not and this can encourage them to continue to participate in the treatment. What we've also learned over the last, ah, decade, 15 years is that depression measures can tell us what treatment is mostly likely to be effective with the client at this point in time. 

00:11:40
What Treatment? Severe BA Moderate BA CBT Mild BA CBT 

00:11:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY We know if depression scores are quite severe that behavioral activation is the most helpful therapy to get people moving again. Ah, one score is dropped in no more moderate range than either cognitive interventions or behavioral interventions can be effective. And of course with mild depression, behavioral, cognitive and actually there's a lot of depression treatments interpersonal. There's many different pathways to helping people who are depressed and that's the very good news. 

00:12:10
BDI-II Scores â‰¥ 29: severe 20-28: moderate 14-19: mild 0-13: minimal QIDS-SR16 Scores â‰¥16: severe 11-15: moderate 6-10: mild 0-5: minimal 

00:12:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Now, in terms of what does it mean to be severe, moderate, or whatever there are some scores here on the Beck Depression Inventory. I know a lot of therapist, ah, because of the modest cost, ah, of using the Beck Depression Inventory don't wanna use it. So, I found that there is, ah, measure available on the internet called the QIDS-SR16 that's one of the most exciting, appealing names for measure I've ever seen. Ah, it's the Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms Self Report, 16 item version that's what that stands for. And if you just put in the search box on the internet QIDS-SR16 you'll find, ah, this measure there and they've got nice equivalent's measures that, ah, an equation you can use to convert scores on this measure to Beck Depression Inventory scores if you wanna compare your treatment progress with that in the published literature. The other nice thing about the, the QUIDS-SR16 is this been translated into over 30 some languages all of which are available on the internet as under Fair Use. So there's no longer any reason for therapist to say they don't have a good measure of depression that they can use. 

00:13:25
Target Specific Symptoms Trouble Sleeping Avoidance Self-criticism Inactivity 

00:13:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Now, if you're-- the, the other main thing that's helpful if you are measuring depression is you can look and see what symptoms are feeding into the depression the most. So I'm teaching therapist to look at which of the items on whatever measure you're using, do the persons have the highest scores on. And to make sure that you are actually helping people target those symptoms. There's a good example, is sometimes people will target as a score three which is usually the highest score that they're not sleeping well. Well, we used to just say, hope you're not sleeping well it's just a symptom of depression when your depression lifts you'll get better. But actually, if not sleeping well, is a primary symptom you should be treating their sleep because there's research that's come out this year that shows that if people starts sleeping better, their depression lifts. So there's many pathways to depression. We wanna make sure we're treating the pathways that are most individually important to the person sitting in front of us. And symptom measures of depression are the one of the ways to give us an idea that, ah, you might think, well, of course we always treat the symptoms of depression but I would say most of time as clinicians, we do not. You know, person comes in and they say, well, my, my, ah, in-laws are coming this weekend. I'm very stressed out about that. Fair enough, and that's a good-- important thing to talk about but if you're trying to treat depression and you spend the whole weekend problem solving the in-laws upcoming visit, and you spend no time talking about the, the characteristics of depression, the symptoms of depression, the things that are contributing in maintaining the depression that's a session where you're really not making forward progress on relieving depression. 

00:15:15
Behavioral Activation Therapy Getting clients moving again Three types of activities improve mood â€¢ Pleasure â€¢ Mastery â€¢ Overcoming avoidance 

00:15:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Now, in terms of the treatments for depression, ah, two that have the most, ah, evidence-based, first is behavioral activation which we wanna definitely use when people are very severely depressed. And of course the idea of behavioral activation therapy is very simple as getting clients moving again. People feel better particularly when they're doing three types of activities and everyday you wanna help people find a balance of activities where they experience pleasure, they do something that gives them a sense of mastery of accomplishment and where they use anti-avoidance. And this sounds really good in theory but in practice it can be hard to get depressed people to do more activities. 

00:15:55
3 Highly Effective Behavioral Experiments Graded tasks 5 minutes rule Prediction log Graded Tasks 5 minute rule? 

00:16:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY So one of the things that I teaches that there's three highly effective behavioral experiments that we can use depressed people are reluctant to engage in activities because of their depression. And we can use these experiments depending upon whether they're feeling overwhelmed, pessimistic, or hopeless. And if they're feeling overwhelmed, ah, then one of the most important task is just the graded task, breaking things into small steps, so breaking things into small steps is helpful when people are, ah, quite overwhelmed. But very often, ah, it's, ah, more sense of inertia, when we're depressed and we're sitting, it feels like it takes tremendous effort to stand up. And so, we tend to wanna continue to sit down. How many of you when do you have a task to do that you're not particularly looking forward to which is a case with pretty all task when we're depressed. How many of you when you have a task you're not looking forward to doing you think, "I'll do that later when I feel more like it." I'll be easier to do later when I have more motivation. This kind of thought is, is quite a part of our human nature, it's quite common in depression. This is one of the reasons why many, many years ago I developed wi-- with-- for work with my depressed clients what I call the five minute rule. And the five minute rules, I teach my clients and I say, "Look, if there's something you don't really wanna do, and we've written it down as a part of your plan for activities for today, ah, I'll tell you what, if you'd-- all you need to do, is do it for five minutes." And at the end of five minutes, you can decide whether you wanna quit doing it, and you can completely check it off of your list as having fully done it. And, if you want you can continue, that's up to you. But five minutes is all you're all obligated to do any given task. So my clients would look at me and they'd say, "Really? I can like start doing the dishes, get the dishes, the sink full of soapy water, put a few dishes in, wash one or two dishes. And if I've got a whole pile of dishes and that five-minute timer goes off, I can just quit? And say I've done the dishes?" "Absolutely," I say. Now, the five-minute rules are wonder rule for depression because inertia works in many different ways. And it's, it's actually based on some research that was done in the 1960s, that shows that motivation rarely precedes behavior but it almost always follows behavior. So once we start doing an activity inertia works in our favor. So what depressed clients come back and tell me as they'll say, "Well, I didn't feel like doing the dishes but I got and said-- well, I set my timer for five minutes. Christine says I only have to do it for five minutes. So I started doing it. The timer went off. And at that point, I was so far into it and I thought, oh, I may as well just finish the dishes and I felt really good about it." So they have an anti-depressant list lift just by doing it. So the five-minute rules is really good for overcoming inertia. Now then you have people who are more pessimistic and hopeless. 

00:19:20
Prediction Log DECIDE Activity PREDICT Pleasure 4 GO Do it ACTUAL Pleasure 9 4 Compare 9 

00:19:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY And for these people, they don't engage in activities cuz they say, what's the use of, what difference will it make. And when this a predominant thinking pattern for people, one of the best things to do is to make a list of several activities, have them predict how-- what the benefit will be of the activity or how good they'll feel doing the activity. And then have them actually go and do activity and write down a rating of how good they actually felt doing it. And then over the course of a week, you can look over these ratings together and of course with depression what people usually observe is that, ah, they feel much better than they predicted they will. And this begins to help them learn that they can't choose activities based on what their depression tells them, they outcome will be they have to actually engage in the activities. 

00:20:10
Cognitive Skills USE thought records IDENTIFY Negative automatic thoughts Relevant images Hot thought TEST thoughts & Images On paper In action 7-column thought record 

00:20:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Now, of course the behavioral part is just the first part of treatment in cognitive behavioral therapy we then go and teach them many cognitive skills which I won't talk about in great detail. Ah, then as Greenberger and I wrote a book called the Mind Over Mood which teaches people how to use thought records to identify and test out, ah, the thoughts that, ah, they have that contribute to their depression. One of the characteristics of depression is that, ah, we have, when we're depressed, thousands of negative, automatic thoughts every day. And the idea of the thought record is not that you have to do thought records the rest of your life, but once people use thought records 15, 20, 25 times, we actually learn new mental processes so that in the future when we have negative automatic thoughts, our brain will automatically say, "Hang on, what's the evidence? Is there another way of looking at this?" So the thought record is actually a tool that teaches people a new brain pattern to use in responding the negative, automatic thoughts.

00:21:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY The last thing that I wanna say is that, ah, and this is the Mind Over Mood book which has been, ah, translated into 23 languages and, ah, it's widely used around the world. Uhm, the other thing I wanna say about the thought record is that many people misunderstand and think that cognitive therapy relies on negative thinking and depression to be distorted. And that's not true. Just because you're depressed doesn't mean some of your negative thoughts aren't going to be true. Ah, sometimes, our-- when we do, we thought-- whether we look for the evidence that supports and doesn't support our negative thoughts, it turns out there is a lot of evidence to support, you know, that we have problem you know, I, I don't have the skills to get, ah, an-- good job and my s-- er-- I mean, my field anymore, or, ah, there's real problems in our relationship and I see signs that my partners about to leave me. This may be very true negative thoughts and so in the case of that, we, we do teach in our book and we do in therapy help people form action plans to solve those true negative issues in their life. 

00:22:25
Identify and Build on Client Strengths 

00:22:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY The final thing I wanna say is, ah, I'm doing a lot of presentations that this conference on something that Kathleen A. Mooney and I been developing over the past 20 years called Strengths-Based CBT. And We're really trying to get people doing cognitive behavioral therapy to identify and incorporates strengths in all the work that they do. And in particular, in depression work, it's so important early on in your meeting people who are depressed to try to find out about some of their positive interest, hobbies, things that they were engaged in before they got depressed. Because if you can get them to do some of these homework assignments building on their strengths, you will get further, faster with them. So if you have somebody who really likes to tinker with motorcycles and they have two or three motorcycles in their garage, and you're doing behavioral activation with them, don't just randomly pull activities off the shelf, get them out in their garage tinkering on the-- the thing that they love, their motorcycles. So that's one way to identify and build on client strengths. 

00:23:30
Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy May 2012 Padesky.com 

00:23:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY We recently wrote an article which you can get from our, ah, website Padesky.com on strengths-based cognitive behavioral therapy, a four-step model to build resilience. And right now, I'm partnering with some researchers in England and we're doing a study where we're gonna see if actually including a few sessions on positively building resilience and teaching people how to indentify their life and use it in the face of difficulties that come up. If that can actually lead to better outcomes and lower relapse for cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. So the next time I come back I'll be able to, ah, report on what we find in that research, ah, and that's all that I'll say for now, but those are some of the ideas that are currently on my mind when I think about best practices and evidence-based practice in the treatment of depression.

00:24:30
The Evolution of Psychotherapy Topical Panel 2 Depression Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. Friday, December 13, 2013 

00:24:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Good morning everyone. It does seem, ah, ironic to be this close to Disneyland, the happiest place on earth talking about depression. So, we're gonna make room the happiest place on earth for this, for this, ah, this hour. Ah, it's really, ah, the treat as always to be able to listen to Jon and Christine, two very different perspectives of course. Jon advocated a very strong, social component and social participation addressing the social dimension of depression. Christine addresses the cognitive and behavior. And automatically what that tells you is when both approaches work in more, the depression is a very complicated phenomenon, a very multidimensional phenomenon and in a way it is, ah, a shame that here we are at this evolution of psychotherapy meeting, and as far depression goes, psychotherapy is becoming less and less relevant because the majority of people aren't going for therapy, they're getting medicated. The majority treatment, the most common form of treatment for depression is the use of anti-depressants. So, I, I wanna we-- talk about that for a just a couple of minutes this isn't it anti-depressant talk. But I do wanna comment on it because it's the reality of it. 

00:26:10
The Evolution of Psychotherapy Is Depression Caused By: â€¢ Genetics? â€¢ A biochemical imbalance in the brain? â€¢ Inflammation, an elevation in C-reactive protein? â€¢ Psychosocial stressors? â€¢ Cognitive distortions? â€¢ A lack of environmental and social rewards? â€¢ Social inequities? â€¢ Cultural/familial influences? â€¢ Mishandling key vulnerable situations? â€¢ A poor diet? â€¢ A lack of physical exercise? 

00:26:10
MICHAEL YAPKO But what you're, you're getting already as, for every clinician, if I ask you the question what causes depression, think about your reflex of answer to that, what causes depression? If you immediately find yourself sane, it's caused by a biochemical imbalance in the brain, a shortage of the neurotransmitter serotonin. The drug companies love you. But you must know if you stay current with literature that the shortage of serotonin hypothesis is dead. And, ah, you know, there isn't really anybody talking about that anymore. It's been a drug advertising gimmick. And in fact, here in the United States you know, for so many-- when you come from other countries, United States people usually shocked by the number of drug adds that they see on the television. There's only two countries on the planet that allow it, the United States and the others New Zealand. So the-- we get hold over and over and over again. But if you look at this particular slide, is depression caused by genetics? Is it about the biochemical in the brain, imbalance? What is it about inflammation, or an elevation in C-reactive proteins? Psychosocial stressors? Cognitive distortions? A lack of environmental social rewards, diet, exercise? If you do review of the literature you will find ample evidence to support everyone of this perspectives. And so the bottom line is you end up treating depression based on your particular view point. And if you happened to like cognitive therapy, then it makes sense to you to do cognitive therapy. And if you happen to like medications and you're happy to prescribe medications, and if you exercise is best then you're happy to tell people the exercise, or change or diet or whatever you tell them. And anyone of these perspectives, it's not that it's wrong, it's that it's entirely incomplete. Each perspective can only addressed one particular dimension and there and lies the problem. 

00:28:15
The Evolution of Psychotherapy No Amount of Medication Can Teach Your Client: â€¢ More effective coping skills â€¢ More realistic explanatory styles â€¢ Healthier relationship styles â€¢ More flexible and discriminative cognitive skills â€¢ Sophisticated problem-solving skills â€¢ More effective decision-making strategies â€¢ How to build and maintain a support network â€¢ How to transcend an advance personal history â€¢ How to build a realistic and motivating future 

00:28:15
MICHAEL YAPKO But given that medication is the most common form treatment. These are the things that even if you are a fan of medication which that these days is a little bit harder to be. I don't know how much you've been following what's been going on but I can give you a quick tour of it. If you go to YouTube and type in the search engine 60 minutes, antidepressants, you'll get a chance to see the 14-minute piece that 60 minutes aired last year, featuring the work of Irving Kirsch questioning the value of antidepressants. And suggesting with a recalculation of more honest data, the data that had been hidden by the drug companies, that depression-- the antidepressants really aren't much more effective than placebos and in fact, carry so many detriments associated with them. And so it sparked the huge furor, there are now more than a dozen books published in the last few years to slamming the drug companies. And they've been busted. The even-- the editor of the premier medical journal, the journal of the American Medical Association JAMA wrote a blistering editorial about how duped and deceived even the journals had been in publishing antidepressants studies because they've been tainted by, contaminated by drug company influenced. There are literally billions and billions of dollars at stake. But even if somehow you managed to still be okay about referring people for medications which I hope you will rethink. Ah, I'll give you some specific reasons to rethink that. You would have to conceive that there are things that medications not just will not do, but cannot do and some of those things are on this list that is theoretically up on the screen here. 

00:30:10
The Evolution of Psychotherapy No Amount of Medication Can Teach Your Client: â€¢ More effective coping skills â€¢ More realistic explanatory styles â€¢ Healthier relationship styles â€¢ More flexible and discriminative cognitive skills â€¢ Sophisticated problem-solving skills â€¢ More effective decision-making strategies â€¢ How to build and maintain a support network â€¢ How to transcend an advance personal history â€¢ How to build a realistic and motivating future 

00:30:10
MICHAEL YAPKO There we go. It can't teach people coping skills, medications can't build you a support network, medications can't change your history and make it easier for you to deal with the disappointments and rejections, and humiliations in your life. The medications can't teach you the life skills that we need to have, and there and lies the problem. You know, more than a decade ago, just over a decade ago the World Health Organization published a global disease burden study, ah, around world suggesting at that time that depression was the fourth greatest cause of human suffering and disability which tells you how pervasive depression is and how serious it is. And they predicted that by the year 2020, depression would rise to be the second greatest cause of human suffering and disability. Well, just last month, ah, November 5th who did an update and we have already reach that point. It is now the second greatest cause of human suffering and disability. The problem of depression is growing, it's not diminishing and, ah, the, the recent book on depression I wrote is called Depression Is Contagious to point out the social forces that place people at risk. Why are people in this crowded planet of ours, as Jon was pointing out, why are people dying of loneliness? Why are people sloppy and their thinking that they don't know how to use information which is what makes cognitive therapy so invaluable? Why aren't people learning to think critically? Why aren't they learning to develop relationships? Why have people become expandable? When did human life get so cheap? And so when we look at all the things that medications can't do, all it reinforces is the importance of what you do for a living, no one can replace you. But how you think about the treatment is everything. And what's curious to me of course is how readily therapist have capitulated to the medical model? 

00:32:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 

00:32:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Literally rolled over as if therapy doesn't have more to contribute than medication ever could. Well, earlier this year, again put the slide to back up and please keep it up, thank you. The, ah, the earlier this year I wrote an article, published an article and the journal called Treating depression with antidepressants, drug-placebo efficacy debates limit broader considerations. It's not just about whether the drugs work although that's obviously a core consideration. But I laid out eight other factors that influence the quality of people's response to treatment. And isn't it interesting how the studies that have come out of the Neuropsychiatric Institutes most notably UCLA's have shown that people's responses to medications are mediated by their expectations. And certainly it's people's expectations that we've known for a long time are the strongest influence of how they respond to psychotherapy. I have a very different response to the inertia. Now, I happened to log cognitive therapy and at times it's a little too cognitive for my perspective. I really wanna know not just what the person's beliefs are, or what their quality of thinking is but how do somebody get absorbed in this. Well, this particular article with all the nine different concerns that I think every therapist should have from ecological concerns to how the therapeutic relationship is defined, I will be happy to send you a reprint of this article. If you would like it, there's a basket on the back table you can just drop your business card in or your email address and I'll be happy to send it to you. But it, it will give you very compelling reasons to think twice before you refer somebody on for antidepressants.

Strands of Evidence Depression is About Much More than Biology Run Amok â€¢ Genetics and Epigenetics â€¢ Neuroscience â€¢ Affective Neuroscience â€¢ Epidemiology â€¢ Individual Psychology â€¢ Social Forces (e.g., culture, attachment) Major Premise: Depression is largely a social phenomenon: socially defined, socially transmitted, and treatment is socially defined Consider the implications... 

00:34:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, so from the, the psychotherapy side of the equation what's happened in the research is, the more that we've learned about depression, the more that we've learned about biochemistry, the more that we've learned about genetics, the more that we've how much our social lives mediate our perspectives and responses. And so all of these fields have contributed to an awareness that depression is contagious not in a viral sense or a bacterial sense but in a social sense. And to be able to look at that quality of how people get socialized, how people get absorbed in a perspective, that works against them and sets them up to be depressed. If we make this an individual phenomenon and just focus on the individuals quality of thinking where the individuals quality behavior that will address one dimension of it. But to take it out-- out of the larger social context misses the point, because I've been particularly interested in it ha-- when we look at what are called the transgenerational risk factors. Why is it that the child of a depressed parent is anywhere from three to six times more likely to become depressed than the child of a non-depressed parent. How does depression get passed from generation to generation? And now that we have the first three generation studies to show, this is what's scary that not only does depression increase in prevalence from one generation to the next, it also increases in severity. So when we look at the largest demographic group, it's the 25 to 44 year olds, if we look at the fastest demographic group, it's their children. And what I'm particularly concerned about is, if you're worried about 16-year-old depressed people, young people which you should be, what I'm even more worried about it 10 years from now when they have kids. And so that's the, the piece that's missing when we only approach this from an intrapersonal point of view. And what I'm suggesting is we need to do both. We need to look at it intrapersonally as well as interpersonally. 

00:36:35
The Evolution of Psychotherapy The Implications are Profound for: â€¢ Attempts to manualize treatment â€¢ Medications â€¢ Intrapersonal therapies â€¢ Marriages and families â€¢ Schools, universities â€¢ Workplace environments â€¢ Prevention opportunities 

00:36:40
MICHAEL YAPKO The implications of these are so profound why we can't manualize treatment? Why we can't drug these problems away? Why we can't just focus on the individual and think that we're making a difference? It's why we help one person but depression rolls merely on. How important it is help strengthen marriages now more than ever and at the same time so often therapist say to me, "well, I don't work with couples, I don't work with families." I hear that, I don't really understand it given everything that we know about how shared a phenomenon this is. How much we need to help schools and universities, the counseling centers are swapped with kids coming in from high school who are already on antidepressants, who are already struggling and coping, getting to the university environment. They're not even close to ready to be able to deal with the pressures they're facing. And certainly in terms of workplace environments, how much we're seeing changeovers in businesses. The Wall Street Journal did a study, they suggested that depression was causing the US economy more than 100 and $20 billion a year in missed work days and people causing accidents at work, doing lousy work. So, there, there's a lot to say about the implications of all of these things. And the fact that we've actually developed prevention strategies, is to me the most important part of all these things that we could talk about. Prevention actually works. And to be able to look at the different studies that have been done in various environments, how much education matters, how much support matters. But the, the-- there's a tremendous amount of information that we have to give people but it can't be summarized as take Prozac. 

00:38:30
The Evolution of Psychotherapy Why Hypnosis for Depression â€¢ Helps people focus and shift their focus â€¢ Facilities the acquisition of new skills â€¢ Encourages people to re-define themselves as resourceful â€¢ Eases the transfer of information across contexts â€¢ Intensifies useful subjective associations â€¢ Provides experiential learning â€¢ Defines people as active managers of themselves, encouraging a realistic goal-connection, rather than as victims 

00:38:35
MICHAEL YAPKO So the last thing I wanna talk about is f-- we know that depression is an experience, it's a product of and it's a cause of your thoughts and feelings, and behaviors and everything else. What I've been studying all these years is how do people get absorbed in the perspective that works against them. We're now in the realm of hypnosis. So that instead of, of handing someone a piece of paper and asking them to predict how they're gonna react to circumstance, to be able to use hypnosis you know, we, we talk about quote unquote, "automatic thoughts," 50 years before cognitive therapy came along, hypnosis literature was described in a phenomenon called ideocognition. What about the use of hypnosis to introduce positive automatic thoughts that become just as reflexive? What about the use hypnosis to build expectancies so the people will participate? What predict somebody's willingness to do a homework assignment? Their expectations primarily. The attitude, why should I do it if I don't think it's gonna make difference? To absorb the person experientially in the idea that their experience is malleable, that even if you're the worst hypnotist in the world, even if all you know how to do is go 10 relax, nine deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper. Eight relax, relax, relax. Seven going deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper. This is not a sophisticated way of absorbing people, I mean really, what's the relationship between counting numbers and getting absorbed unless you're an accountant? But the person's breathing slows down, their tension diminishes, their ruminations diminished. The person feels better and they now have direct experiential evidence, their symptoms are malleable. And to teach them skill to be able to go to sleep, because Christine was absolutely right the sleep issues are valuable not only diagnostically but prognostically. And hypnosis is huge help in that regard. 

00:40:40
The Evolution of Psychotherapy Why Hypnosis for Depression â€¢ Helps people focus and shift their focus â€¢ Facilities the acquisition of new skills â€¢ Encourages people to re-define themselves as resourceful â€¢ Eases the transfer of information across contexts â€¢ Intensifies useful subjective associations â€¢ Provides experiential learning â€¢ Defines people as active managers of themselves, encouraging a realistic goal-connection, rather than as victims 

00:40:40
MICHAEL YAPKO So hypnosis isn't a therapy, all the things that I do revolve around integrating cognitive behavioral therapy with hypnosis. I would describe what I do as cognitive behavioral therapy done hypnotically with the strategic twist. And to, to be able frame it that way, just keeps emphasizing the ability to utilize that capacity for reflexive what's known as automaticity in the field of hypnosis to introduce thoughts that they can have that reflexive way or new perspectives, behaviors, emotions. So there's a lot say about the role of hypnosis and all this. I hope that it's the kind of thing that, ah, just make sense to you. How can we absorb someone in a perspective that's helpful to them. 

00:41:30
Utilizing Hypnosis Can Facilitate Vital Skills Acquisition â€¢ Increased impulse control â€¢ Increased frustration to tolerance â€¢ Greater internal locus of control â€¢ Greater self-awareness and self-acceptance â€¢ Greater emotional self-regulation, coping skill â€¢ Greater empathy, social attunement â€¢ Greater compartmentalization skills allowing increased external orientation 

00:41:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, it also helps with all the skill acquisition you know, both Jon and Christine have emphasize the importance of social skills as well as cognitive behavioral skills and problem solving skills, they're absolutely right. The question is how can we make learning a more focused process? Don't people learn better when they're focused and relaxed. Compelling reasons enough to wanna use that as foundation for integrating these other things that they've been talking about. Anyway, I'll end at there, thank you so much for your attention. Thanks.

00:42:15
MICHAEL MUNION We'll invite the, ah, panel to comment on anything that, that their peers had to say. 

00:42:25
[sil.] 

00:42:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Well, actually just think you've, you've heard three very good and compatible, ah, presentations about working with depression. Ah, the nice thing about depression is that we do have many path-- there are many pathways to becoming depressed. And there are many pathways out of depression. And, ah, I think each of the three of us have-- has, ah, talked about some of the methods that, that we use that are very helpful. So may be un-- unless Jon or-- unless you have other things maybe we could just open it up to - 

00:43:05
MICHAEL YAPKO We got 15 minutes left lest use... 

00:43:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY - your questions. So let's hear, let's hear what you would like to hear more about. 

00:43:15
MICHAEL YAPKO If you wanna step up to the microphones and... 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN I'm over here. 

00:43:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Do you hear me? 

00:43:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:43:20
JON CARLSON Yup. 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. I had a question, ah, about systemically. I work in Chicago and I work in a school system and I noticed that you can't really recommend there, ah, they say it's a liability issue and things. So, how do we get around that systemically? 

00:43:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY You can't recommend what? 

00:43:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Therapy. 

00:43:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Okay, recommend therapy. 

00:43:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Work-- where is the line that separates therapy from education? You can certainly talk about education. You can talk about learning opportunities. You can talk about skill building. You can talk about focusing strategies. You can talk about learning self-management techniques. You can learn you know, to, to frame it within an educational environment as education makes a lot of sense to me. So whether you call it therapy, whether you call it rough, I don't really care. You know, I'm, I'm you know, what, what I'm interested in is how do you get information to the people who need it and make it practical for them to be able to use it. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. 

00:44:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Sure. 

00:44:30
JON CARLSON Ah, you know, I work in Chicago too. I've never heard that before. So that's kind of a new twist for me but I do know that Chicago public schools if that's where you work I'll have counselors. So I don't know why you can't say it's counseling. It's-- you know, you can use the terms interchangeably. 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Uhm, my question is about adolescence and knowing that prefrontal cortex and how it's not developed fully at that time what seems to be the most effective way to approach depression with them. 

00:45:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY I would say, any of the things you've heard can be helpful with adolescence. I mean the-- it doesn't mean adolescence don't have a frontal cortex. Adolescence can think things through-- one of the things I always tell therapist who are doing CBT with adolescence is that all the principles of CBT work well with adolescence but you have to make sure you deliver therapy in a way that's gonna be appealing to adolescence. So, ah, adolescence do really well with more experiential work, ah, like role plays and that sort of thing. Adolescence do really well in, ah, group sometimes. Ah, looking at the social circumstances of adolescence is really important you know, they're imbedded in families and school systems and peer groups. And they're also facing, complex social systems on the internet through different social networking sites. And so I mean, I think just talking to adolescence in the terms that are relevant to them, and using any of these methods can be helpful. I mean they're, they're quite capable of, ah, learning through many different modalities. 

00:46:20
JON CARLSON Yeah, and I would also add that it's important to you know, be encouraging. And you know, I think we have to have more fun than a depressing clients, you know, otherwise they're not gonna take the treatment and. And so, ah, you know, find a way to be-- you know, have some enjoyment. You also need to practice harm reduction with teenagers to make sure that until that frontal lode does kick in you put some, ah, conditions around them so that they're not gonna do any long-term harm. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, I've worked with a lot of patients who I think would benefit from reducing their medication and, and using some of the skills that you've all mentioned. Uhm, but I see a lot of anxiety about getting off medication. A lot of patients who have been on their meds for so long sometimes their physicians unfortunately even feed into that and discourage them from, ah, reducing their medication gradually and working on the skills instead. So I'm wonder if you have any comments about that? 

00:47:25
MICHAEL YAPKO I do, uhm, the, the-- one of one the problems with medication, how it defines the relationship. When, when you look at depression as a disorder, it is built on a foundation of passivity. If depression was a commercial product it's slogan would be why bother. And when, when-- the last thing that you wanna do is reinforce that passivity and it's what-- the unfortunate thing about when pre-- medications prescribed is the only treatment. Your-- basically, say to this person, you don't have to learn anything, you don't have to change anything. All you really have to do is take those medication on time. So it reinforces for this person and an external locus of control that somehow it's the medication that's holding them together. And so I want this person to first of all have the anxiety management skills. There is again the value of things like hypnosis, mindfulness, guided imagery, any of those kinds of things. But I also want this person to be educated to understand this isn't something that happens to you, that you're a participant in the quality of your own experience. And in fact, one of the most recently evolved models of depression that has already attained a lot of, ah, of, ah, has gained a lot empirical support is called the stress generation model and looks at how depressed people actively participate in their own depression through the quality of decisions that they make. So befo-- if this person is anxious about getting off the meds and the real task is what are the skills this person is gonna need to learn to have a sense of confidence about their own ability to manage life on life's terms. So to-- the, the-- I, I just want this person to know your mood isn't being regulated by the drug. That the-- that best what the drug can do is help with some of the vegetative symptoms but it's not gonna teach all the other skills that you're still gonna need to learn if you're gonna manage your life well. So it's getting people ready for that. 

00:49:30
JON CARLSON Ah, you know, I think I would like to start it with a question and to, to ask you-- your client how their life be different if they weren't on drugs. And you know, and use that answer to frame where you go from here because you might find a lot of people, they're resistant like Michael talked about. And other people who are you know, really welcoming the chance through the help of medication. 

00:49:50
MICHAEL YAPKO You know, I did had-- and that's how would your life be different but how would view of yourself. Be sure... 

00:49:55
JON CARLSON Sure, perfect. Yeah. 

00:49:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY And also when it-- when people are reluctant to go off of medication or when physicians are reluctant to take them off of medication, it's very helpful to frame it is-- let's do an experiment. Ah, it can be really helpful to educate physicians about what the alternatives that-- what skills you're gonna be teaching them and even to sometimes send physicians you know, brief research papers that show the efficacy of whatever you're gonna be teaching them. But then you can propose the physician and the, and the client that you do an experiment. Let's, let's start to taper the medication off. Have you-- be actively practicing the skills. And let's just find out what happens. And a lot times when people find out is they begin to taper the medication, ah, and as they begin to practice the skills that their mood doesn't get worse, in fact it, it may improve and they may have fewer side effects and it becomes easier with experience. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:50:50
MICHAEL MUNION Thank you for your question. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN I would love to hear from each of you, ah, kind of clinical response to hypothetical client who's like, yeah, you know, I don't wanna do that. Whatever kind of a assignment, what other kind of action you're encouraging a client to do there's a reason why she doesn't wanna do that. And so, inclination to be completely accepting and nonjudgmental and all of this. And also, help a client unstuck without making them bad or shaming them. 

00:51:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY I, I always start with what you know, what goal is most important to the client. And I think one the mistakes that I find the therapist make a lot, is, ah, we try to get them engaged in doing different interventions without clearly linking how that intervention is gonna help the client get what they want. So I think you need to first get very clear on what the clients goal is. Ah, is the client's goal to, ah, stay home not have to get a job for instance in which case if you're in-- trying to get them out of the house and get them you know, back into the workforce, they are gonna fight you every step of the way. So you need to be very clear, and, and very curious with clients. And you know, what is it you would like to accomplish? What's most important to you? And sometimes doing even imagery or things like that, ah, this is where I think Michael's in my approaches would get very close together. As I find, ah, with people who maybe aren't sure what they want using some kind of imagery, positive imagery, getting them to imagine what it is that they-- where they would like to be to-- two months from now, three months from now, four months from now? And then telling them that you know, I'm not gonna ask you to do anything that isn't gonna help you get toward your goal and I just ask you to try things out and give me honest feedback. And if you think it's not helping you, I'm not gonna keep asking you to do that. So I think to form a close alliance with your client, where they really see you as an advocate of helping them get to where whey wanna get to. Ah, when you get client saying yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, I think that's generally shows that for whatever reason, you and they have not yet formed a very, ah, strong therapeutic alliance. 

00:53:20
JON CARLSON Good. You know, I think I would wanna talk to your client, uhm, you know, kind of I have come Jesus moment here and, ah, you know, just re-- you know, really get down-- this isn't the way therapy works. You know, I suggest things you reject them. I suggest things you reject them and, ah, you know, I think we need to you know, re-look at the fundamentals of what we're all about. And, ah, you know, really see if, if this is your decision, ah, ah, you know, if it-- ah, I don't wanna be a part of it. And, ah, you know, just wasting our time. 

00:53:55
MICHAEL YAPKO For my perspective, that standard, that's how every client comes in whose depressed. Why bother, why do anything I shouldn't you know, why I should I talk to you. You can't understand, you'll never gonna make any difference, why should I do the homework, why should I read the reads, why should I do any of it. I get it. That standard, but the, the whole point is that when this person has that quality of nar-- negative expectation, one of the patterns that regulates depression is a patter called the internal orientation. The person using their feelings to make decisions about what they're going to do. And the-- when of co-- this refers to the stress generation model, making bad decisions based on your feelings. When you're feeling bad you make depressed decisions. So couple of things, for me that's the, the more-- the more quickly and vehemently, I run into that wall that says, why bother the more quickly I'm gonna introduce hypnosis into the relationship to demonstrate variability and experience. I've developed a process over the years called hypnotically building expectancy because there is the statement of negative expectancy. I don't want to-- I don't think it's gonna make a difference anyway. And Christine is exactly right, every client who comes in want something, they just don't think they can get. They just wanna how to get there. But I wa-- one of the characteristics of hypnosis that is so valuable is the characteristic called dissociation. And one of the ways that you structure these kinds of building expectancy sessions is how do I help you separate, dissociate your mood state, your feelings from the course of action that you take? I don't wanna wait until you feel like it. I want you to be willing to engage, be curious about what the possibilities are but set aside the doubts, set aside the negative expectancies, set aside the hopelessness, set aside all those things. And it-- and you can't do that through a rational conversation though there are certain things you can do in hypnosis that you really just can't do any other way. And that has been enormously valuable for me because that's a first or second session intervention. And the other thing about that why it-- how would it evolved over the years? Depressed clients have a very high mortality rate. In the world of psychotherapy, a mortality rate means the number of people who come for one session or two sessions and they don't come back. They drop out. That's called the mortality statistic. You can have great things to teach someone but if they're not there than-- then it really doesn't matter. So a lot of this has to do with how you construct the very first session, and that's what I'm doing in the first session is hypnotically building expectancy and starting to teach the person that there are other frames of reference fort decision making besides how you feel. 

00:56:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY If you like... 

00:56:55
JON CARLSON And, and that client is moving against you, there's a lot of energy but it's against you. And, ah, you know, I think you have to turned that around. 

00:57:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY And I, I just wanna make disagree with one thing that you said Michael with-- which is that hypnosis was the only way to make, ah, shift in that... 

00:57:15
MICHAEL YAPKO There are things that you can with hypno-- with hypnosis... 

00:57:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY With hypnosis okay. Because in, in CBT what would do is-- one of the errors that people make is they try to be too conver-- to talk about things too much with depression. And actually the most important thing early on is to create experiences in the therapy, ah, where is-- you know, someone for example who says I'm too tired when I'm sitting down. I couldn't possibly get up and do something. You don't wanna talk about that. You wanna right then and there get them up in your office, move around with them, look at things, create an experience so that they have an immediate experience to respond to and play off of. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN They made-- Dr. Carlson I didn't understand your last comment. 

00:57:55
JON CARLSON Ah, you know, the-- it's just a lot of energy that the person has going against you and you wanna take that energy and identify that you're really good at arguing, you're really good at, at moving against strength. I wonder if there's a way to use that energy that you have resisting the-- towards doing something constructive as that something you wanna do. I think you wanna bring that out into the open, because you know, that's an act if somebody is arguing with you. I mean, that, that, that-- it isn't just something that they are saying, "Oh, I can't do it. I can't do that." That takes effort. 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:58:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN There's next question. 

00:58:35
MICHAEL MUNION I'm sorry. It's been our great fortune to have this panel here today. They're very distinguished and they know so much about the treatment of depression. It's now our misfortune to be out of time. Ah, and please join me in thanking our panel. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN Thank you guys.
