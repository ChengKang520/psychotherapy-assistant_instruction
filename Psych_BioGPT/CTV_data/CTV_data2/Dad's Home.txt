PRIMARY focus "DAD'S HOME" Produced by Scott W. Smith 

00:00:35
NARRATOR Mike Becker will tell you, he is the man of the house. 

00:00:35
MIKE BECKER I can't even fathom I guesses to how many diapers I have changed, you know with four kids… I don't think there is anybody that can out diaper me these days, how many months they are in diapers… Oh gosh! 

00:00:45
NARRATOR Nearly five years ago, he gave up his career as marketing manager to become the primary caregiver at home. His only regret is that he waited so long to make the switch. 

00:00:55
MIKE BECKER The reason why I... I didn't get into the sooner was because of my ego, because I came from the traditional family, dad worked, mom stayed at home. It wasn't until I started looking out well why... why... why... am I doing this, you know. What am I providing, how am I helping our family, because most of my income was just gonna pay for daycare and someone else is raising my kid. 

00:01:20
NARRATOR Mike's wife Kori is a well paid corporate executive. She agreed it made financial sense for her to continue working while Mike stayed home to raise the children. 

00:01:25
KORI REED BECKER For us, it became a situation where Mike was taking care of the kids. I was coming home and still doing traditional female chorus. Umm...cooking, I was still cleaning the house and doing all those things. 

00:01:40
NARRATOR In order to make life more balanced, Mike had a few adjustments to make. So, now Mike cleans the house, cooks... 

00:01:50
MIKE BECKER My repertoire is somewhat small, but it's growing. 

00:01:55
NARRATOR Does the groceries... 

00:01:55
MIKE BECKER I'm gonna put these in here, because it's a glass jar okay. 

00:01:55
NARRATOR ...and changes diapers. But don't call him Mr. Mom. Mike prefers a different title. 

00:02:05
MIKE BECKER Family manager does it all you know... 

00:02:05
NARRATOR And that job includes giving his wife a little manly advice from time to time. 

00:02:10
KORI REED BECKER I laugh, because when I worked in a very male-dominant environment in the past company, so to get part of lingo you had to know some of the football lingo, so Mike was great. I said "Okay give me what happening on Sunday night, Monday morning, give me what happened I've to write on the cooperate (inaudible ) with so and so and did not (inaudible ). 

00:02:26
NARRATOR Most of Mike's day start just before 7 a.m. when his eldest child wakes up. There are kids to dress and feed and the bus to catch. 

00:02:35
MIKE BECKER ...morning. 

00:02:35
NARRATOR Next, he turns his attention to his other children including the baby, Lobby(ph). He tries to have everyone clothed and fed and out the door by 9 a.m. 

00:02:45
MIKE BECKER Okay you guys, let's go across watch the cars. I tried to have something planned for the kids most... most every day. Umm... don't try to wear them out everyday, but wanna have some sort of activity for them to be involved in whether it's um… a class that they go to that we've signed up for or whether it's time at the library or sometimes we go to the children's museum, just kinda different things to keep them active and keep them involved. 

00:03:10
NARRATOR And where is mom all this time? Kori leave the house at 6 every morning before everyone else is up in order to catch the train to work. 

00:03:20
KORI REED BECKER My department is in charge of putting a daily newsletter out, so on the train, I'm reading the financial times, the Wall Street journal and getting ready for the day. So, I basically, I'm starting to working when I get on the train at 6.25 and once I'm in the office for checking the news feeds, and then it's a number of things from taking phone calls, to check in emails like, when I walk away from my desk, I can get out of 50 emails and just sometimes I just say walking back to my desk and like "Oh please don't be a message, please don't be any email". Umm... have any number of meetings throughout the day and maybe a lunch meeting. 

00:03:50
NARRATOR Her husband, Mike has a lunch meeting of his own. 

00:03:50
They told all the kids to wear their (inaudible ) colors and their red sweat shirts and so… 

00:03:55
MIKE BECKER …but they're all turned green. 

00:03:55
Jimmy(ph) said there was a… they were… they were having a good time, it was pretty crowded. 

00:04:00
MIKE BECKER So, usually we are home at around 2. Kids got a good hour and hour and a half nap and then. They are up and were usually home that in the afternoon, get in any homework that needs to be done or reading books, umm... will have a lots of play dates. Kids will come over and play and so, you know, there isn't really a typical day. Because every day is a little bit different. 

00:04:25
NARRATOR Later on the afternoon, Mike begins to prepare dinner. When Kori's 12 or 13-hour workday ends, she takes the opportunity to spent some time with the kids. 

00:04:35
MIKE BECKER When she comes home, it's... it's all about her, it's all about her with the kids, finding out what's going on in their lives, you know. 

00:04:45
NARRATOR But even those plans can change. 

00:04:45
KORI REED BECKER I know sometimes, I call home, at like 6 o'clock and Mike says "Just the witching hour of the kids and I know it drives him crazy when I say, I'm... I'm... still at the office. 

00:04:55
MIKE BECKER If she needs to say "Work to finish a project" that's what she needs to do. And if that means she gets home at 8 and can go and kiss the kids goodnight and that's you know, that's what has to happen for, for the success of our family. 

00:05:10
NARRATOR For Mike and Kori, the switch from the traditional family to one where dad stays at home, was the choice they wanted to make. But for Irv and Michelle Gorman of Chicago, Illinois, it was a family plan they were forced to make. 

00:05:20
IRV GOMAN My father, if he were alive would say "Oh you decided to be stay-at-home dad what the hell you're thinking. You know, are you nuts? 

00:05:30
NARRATOR For 20 years, Irv Gorman was film grip(ph), which mean he ought(ph) heavy equipment around on movie and television sets. He would tell you it's a real man's job. 

00:05:40
IRV GOMAN Being a film grip(ph), is a pretty... pretty manly macho job I'll say. Umm... most of the... most of the gear is heavy. It's metal. It's sharp umm... and you got to be able to... you got to be able to handle yourself physically for most of the... of the tasks that you're... you're charged to do. 

00:06:00
NARRATOR Everything changed overnight when Irv suddenly got very sick. For their family, the illness couldn't have come at a worse time. 

00:06:05
DR. MICHELLE DAY When I was about two months pregnant, we discovered that Irv had come down with fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis and then our lifestyle was going to be dramatically changed. 

00:06:15
NARRATOR Irv's case of arthritis meant that ever joint in his body hurt. He couldn't lift heavy equipment and was barely able to move. Doctors told him it was disease he would have to live the rest of his life and nothing would ever be the same again. 

00:06:30
IRV GORMAN So now I'm in... in my head I'm thinking great. I'm gonna have a child now. I'm pretty much a cripple at this point. I can't do anything. I mean I couldn't... I couldn't wash my own hair. I couldn't dress myself. It was just really awful and I've got a baby on the way and forget work right now, I don't even now thought I couldn’t be able to walk again or use my hands again. Good, thank you sweetie. You're big helper. 

00:06:55
NARRATOR It became apparent to the Gormans that Irv could no longer sustain the physical labor his work required. They decided he would've to give up his macho job for a mop. 

00:07:05
IRV GORMAN You know, my first reaction was you know... Oh may be I guess I could I don't know you know, I was kinda of nervous, I didn't I... I Oh I can be able to physically, am I gonna be psychologically able to do it and eventually I kinda I came and I said "Okay, I… I'll do it. I'll try it... I'll be a stay-at-home dad, we'll see how it goes" Did you have a good nap honey pie, did you. 

00:07:25
NARRATOR After their daughter Maya was born, Irv accepted his role to do what was best for their family staying home and caring for her, but the adjustment was harder than he expected. 

00:07:35
IRV GORMAN The biggest difficulty umm...in the first few months of being stay-at-home dad umm... I think is a transition, a sort of under transition from... from... what you think life was gonna be like and how life actually is. Up you Daisy(ph) just pull him up. Yeah, that's right. Things don't go ah... exactly as planned. Maya(ph) how about your tennis shoes. 

00:08:05
NARRATOR Dr. Robert Frank, a psychologist was stay-at-home father for 12 years. 

00:08:05
DR. ROBERT FRANK Psychologist The first year, men are feeling very isolated. Ah... especially if you come from the workforce, you've been working 40-50 hours a week, you're used to a camaraderie of being in an office or whatever the case maybe, then to come home and have just kids all day long or one kid even all day long is a very... very difficult transition. 

00:08:25
IRV GORMAN You're trying to entertain them. Good... You're trying to keep them safe. You're trying to keep their things up off the floor. And giraffe too, Raffy is gonna go out too.. We'll put him back. Things get spilled, you got do a laundry, you got do groceries, you got to get you know, we're out of milk. You get you know, there is and it's all day long and you... you got all the stuff to do, all this responsibility and by the time you do get everything done and you get the baby asleep, you are so exhausted. I mean... there is a whole notion of well, I'll be stay-at-home dad, then I'll write my novel you know, from 8 at night until midnight is you know what a joke that is. You know... it is because there's just no energy. 

00:09:05
NARRATOR As neurophysiologist and researcher at Chicago's Northwestern University, Michelle could control her laboratory experiments. What confused her was the chaos she sometimes found at home. 

00:09:20
MICHELLE DAY We just try to team play as best that we can and if there are days where I'm particularly tired, then he tries to do a little more if there are days where he's not feeling particularly well, then I try to do a little more and it eventually gets done. 

00:09:40
IRV GORMAN Ready, one... two... three... yuppee who is my girl. Who is my girl. 

00:09:50
NARRATOR One of the difficulties for Michelle is hearing about, but not seeing some of Maya's first. 

00:10:00
MICHELLE DAY He said "Oh you should just see what Maya did. She just sat up for the first time." 

00:10:05
IRV GORMAN One... two... three... wee... good... ha... ha... I get you know, teared up when I think it must like yeah. I... I've been there for my daughter's first steps. I've been there for her first role over, her first sounds. 

00:10:20
MICHELLE DAY She just kick the ball across the room. It was just amazing. 

00:10:25
IRV GORMAN She comes to me. She gives me a big hug you know, She brings, she... she grabs my finger and shows whenever she has found something new. She brings me and shows it to me. 

00:10:35
MICHELLE DAY How is the baby. So that there're moments where I'm... I'm envious and I wish I could be at home to see those things, but... but I'm not. I'm... I'm... I... I'm here and, and that holds a lot of its own rewards too. 

00:10:55
NARRATOR Together the Gormans are committed to creating a healthy balance of work and home life for Maya. 

00:11:00
MICHELLE DAY It was very important that my priority was my daughter and my family and that I not sacrifice, you know I'm not gonna be 60-70 hours a week in lab in order to advance in my career and not see my daughter. my sweetie, Okay have a good nap. You have a good nap. 

00:11:25
IRV GORMAN I mean, how this I would have missed had I not get into this... this disease. So, you know when I... when I put on the balance sheet, I say, "You need a disease you know and let me... let me be with my daughter and I mean, yes, yes it's definitely a blessing. 

00:11:40
PRIMARY focus 

00:11:45
FRANK BOESCH It looks like a bird. Is that a bird? Well, I have a lot my friends ah... actually umm... say "Man Frank that's pretty awesome, I'd like to do that, you know... go golfing like... you know, there is no time for golf." 

00:11:55
NARRATOR Staying home was a much harder than you ever expected both mentally and physically. 

00:12:00
FRANK BOESCH Being a diabetic, I have to live a very structured life and I… I've learned that I couldn't do that. In fact the very first day, umm... I actually went into hyperglycemia, which is low blood sugar, ah... it wasn't pretty sight. 

00:12:15
NARRATOR Even so, Frank stuck it out and found that he may have lost his income and his structured life, but he gained something much more valuable. 

00:12:25
FRANK BOESCH There it certainly were hidden blessings. Again, I can't reiterate umm... how wonderful it has been or had been to be with my children. I know that I'm... I'm a lot closer to my kids. 

00:12:35
NARRATOR But Renee's time away from her children begun to take its toll on her. 

00:12:40
RENEE BOESCH I would say about six months into it. I realized that it was just too hard physically on me and I... I just I missed my children desperately and I just used to cry in my hotel room. 

00:12:50
NARRATOR She even missed the day-today problems that occurred at home. 

00:12:55
RENEE BOESCH Frank would call and there would be some tragedy like my daughter fell on a table and cut her lip open and, and she'll be crying in the background and I couldn't be there to help her and comfort her. 

00:13:10
FRANK BOESCH Sometime, I didn't want to tell her because, they are in... in messes, but you know I knew... that I had to tell her and I think that... that really crushed her knowing that she can put her motherly hand on the situation. 

00:13:25
RENEE BOESCH I needed to be there. I was her mom. 

00:13:25
NARRATOR After a while it seemed as if this couple's role reversal was taking a turn for the worse. 

00:13:30
RENEE BOESCH He felt like he should be out there making the money, so and, and quite frankly I did to. I... I still respected my husband and I... I loved my husband, but I just felt like... I liked him working more. 

00:13:45
NARRATOR And she wanted to be home more with her children. 

00:13:45
RENEE BOESCH I got down my knees one day and said "Lord I can't do this anymore." I think you know, how much I can handle and I can't handle it anymore. 

00:13:55
NARRATOR Frank equally unhappy, also was praying for a job outside the home. 

00:14:00
RENEE BOESCH He got a phone call about, I would say a week later he had a friend that was needing a medical sales rep and so Frank took the position and umm... and that's what he has been doing. 

00:14:10
NARRATOR With Frank back at work, Renee hopes never return to a situation where her husband is a stay-at-home dad. 

00:14:20
DR. ROBERT FRANK Well, I welcome guys to our 7th Annual At-Home Dads Convention. I'm glad to have you here today. 

00:14:25
NARRATOR Although many dads feel good about staying home, others like Frank can feel like fish out of water and that's why every year across North America stay-at home dads attend conventions like this one. Here fathers like Mike Becker and Irv Gorman can connect with other like-minded men to share their struggles. 

00:14:45
I don't wanna you know paint a rosy picture, you guys know better, you know how… how tough it can be raising kids and they are not always sweet wonderment, enjoy and you know creative contentment. 

00:14:55
NARRATOR Despite the increasing trend of men at home, these fathers sometimes have a hard time being accepted. 

00:15:05
MIKE BECKER We had umm... just moved to a... to a new town and one gentlemen walked directly up to me and asked me what... what made you move to... to.. Denville and I said umm... "It wasn't... it wasn't my job, it was my wife's job." And he said "Oh okay, well what you do?" And I said "Well I'm stay-at-home dad" He kinda looked at me and didn't know what to say, he kinda had a blank look on his face and he just said "oh" and turned... turned away and walked a half. 

00:15:30
KORI REED BECKER They didn't know what to say, and then they would ask me. As I got transfer for my job and here's what I do and so looking back now, I think we laugh about it, but at that time just added stress to the situation. 

00:15:45
NARRATOR Dr. Frank says that fathers need to focus not on what other say, but on what is important to their families. 

00:15:50
DR. ROBERT FRANK Family is most critical issue on our society. Kids do better if dads go to their schools. Moms go to their schools, their grades are gonna be higher. So, the more involvement, the family involvement is really we always known to be the case... it's, it's fairly critical for the best of our children. 

00:16:05
Hey Mike how are you. 

00:16:10
MIKE BEACKER Very good to see you. 

00:16:10
NARRATOR Mike is part of stay-at-home dad support group, that connects via e-mail. They have their own fantasy football league and they socialized together occasionally. 

00:16:15
MIKE BECKER We tried to make sure that we get out at least once a month as a group without the kids and without our spouses away from everybody, so we kinda get rejuvenated. 

00:16:25
My son was asked you know, "to name a person that you admire and he came back with this... this sheet and he wrote my dad. 

00:16:35
Mmm... 

00:16:35
And you know when he came back with that, I mean it really choked me up, because you know, it means a lot that... 

00:16:40
Yeah. 

00:16:40
...your children look to you as that person that's there're for them all the time. 

00:16:50
MIKE BECKER You know, you can share ideas, you can talk about problems that you're having, ask for any advise that they have. When, when your wives come home, that's... that's they want to know about the kids you know... 

00:17:00
Yeah. 

00:17:00
And everything else becomes you know... 

00:17:05
I find a little frustrated. She just give(ph) me any attention. Ha...ha... 

00:17:05
Ha...ha... 

00:17:10
MIKE BECKER Because a lot of the guys have older kids and they've been through it, so they've been there and they can, you know add some good input. 

00:17:15
As a organizer I thought I was when I was in the business world. 

00:17:20
Ah... 

00:17:20
It absolutely nothing to look... 

00:17:20
Ha...ha... 

00:17:25
…care to you organize as you need to get. 

00:17:25
Hmm...hmm... 

00:17:25
You know with just two kids. 

00:17:25
MIKE BECKER Some dads said, it's an easy job. I don't think it's an easy job, but umm... I wouldn't trade it for anything. That's awesome. 

00:17:35
NARRATOR For Irv still in his first year at home, making the transition from macho man to Mr. Mom is a process, but he believes, the rewards outweigh the criticisms. 

00:17:45
IRV GOMAN You get the baby back pack on and pushing her down the… down the street in a little stroller and if especially walk down the loop, down in the business districts and I'll be you know, making the little noises or talking to her. I'll see some guy in a suit and his briefcase and a cell phone and he is marching by and he'd look at me and they will give me that like "oh brother kinda look" you know and... and you know my... my first response is kinda like you know I get "Hey come on buddy, you know, so I could take you, but then, but then go (inaudible ) that's you know why you are so insecure it's okay. So I thought you're you know that, if that guy doesn't get it, it's okay that he doesn't get it, you get it, I mean he, he is doing what he asked to do, what he things he asked to do. He is pretty running around 12-15-16 hour a day out in the world, you get to see your daughter every day all day long. He doesn't to get to see his daughter all day you know, all day long every day. So, you know maybe he should feel sorry for him. 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
IRV GOMAN The ideal world would be both parents can stay home all the time. But obviously in the society, somebody have, you've go out and make money. I mean, the both parents could stay at home, work at home, you know take care of the child... both take care of the children that would be the idea. Next best thing is to have one parent staying at home umm... I think all the time… but be amom or dad.
