Evidence-Based Psychotherapy Treatment Planning 

00:00:30
NARRATOR The following is a presentation of John Wiley & Sons. It's part of an informative series about empirically informed treatment planning. This program is an introduction to evidence based treatment. 

00:00:45
ART JONGSMA Hello and welcome to the first in a series of programs on empirically informed treatment planning for mental health, addiction counseling, and psychotherapy. 

00:00:50
Timothy J. Bruce Ph.D. Arthur E. Jongsma, Jr. Ph.D. 

00:00:50
ART JONGSMA I'm Art Jongsma and joining me is my colleague Dr. Tim Bruce. Today we're going to share with you an overview of the process of empirically informing your treatment plans. 

00:01:00
In This Program... History of the EST Movement EST and EBP Advantages of using ESTs Limitations of ESTs Essential Elements of Treatment Planning Empirically Informed Treatment Planning 

00:01:00
DR. TIM BRUCE In this program we will begin with a brief history of the movement to identify empirically supported psychological treatments. We'll discuss how this movement fits within the larger context of providing evidence based practice. We'll discuss advantages to using empirically supported treatments as well as some of their limitations. Lastly we'll outline the essential elements of treatment planning process and show how it can be informed with goals, objectives and interventions consistent with those of empirically supported treatments. 

00:01:30
ART JONGSMA The use of evidence-based practice is becoming critically important to the mental health community. This program is meant to increase you understanding of how the work on empirically supported psychological treatments can be incorporated into your treatment planning. Empirically informing those plans and moving you work in the direction of evidence-based practice. This program is an overview. In other programs we will get into detail about how to empirically inform treatment plans for specific disorders like depression, panic, social anxiety and substance abuse. 

00:02:05
DR. TIM BRUCE It's important to note that this series is designed to be informational in nature and doesn't intend to be a substitute for clinical training and the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about these topics references are provided in the companion workbook. So let's get started. 

00:02:20
History of the EST Movement 

00:02:20
ART JONGSMA While it can be argued that the movement to empirically informed psychological treatment began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in earnest in the 1990s, both in Great Britain and the United States. Tim, give us some background on that. 

00:02:45
Society of Clinical Psychology American Psychological Association, Division 12 Task Force on Psychological interventions Refers to: the original Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures and the subsequent Task Force on Psychological Interventions 

00:02:45
DR. TIM BRUCE Well [Clears Throat], U.S.'s effort began with an initiative of the American Psychological Association's Division 12 the Society of Clinical Psychology. Beginning in 1993 A.P.A.'s Division 12 organized the Task Force on Psychological Interventions chaired by Diane Chambliss. It was charged with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature to identify psychological treatments whose efficacy had been demonstrated through clinical research. This Task Force delivered two initial reports describing their process and conclusions: One in 1996 and the second one in 1998. As part of their process, the group established two primary sets of criteria or levels of evidence to evaluate and classify therapies is empirically supported. 

00:03:30
Criteria for Treatment Well-Established Treatments Probably Efficacious Treatments 

00:03:30
ART JONGSMA This was quiet important work to establish these criteria. The Group came up with a set of criteria for what they termed Well-Established Treatments and a set for treatments that were Probably Efficacious and we want to spend a little time looking at this in more depth. Tim, why don't you start with Well-Established Treatments? 

00:03:50
Well-Established Treatments Criteria 1: At least two good between-group design experiments must demonstrate efficacy A superiority to pill or psychotherapy placebo or to other treatment Equivalence to an already established treatment with adequate sample sizes Criteria 2: A large series of single-case design experiments must demonstrate efficacy 

00:03:50
DR. TIM BRUCE For a treatment to be categorized as Well-Established the following criteria had to be met: The first was that efficacy needed to be demonstrated between at least two good between-group designs by showing superiority to a pill placebo, psychotherapy placebo or to another treatment or by showing its equivalence to an already established treatment using adequate sample sizes. Alternatively, a treatment could meet this criteria for this category by demonstrating efficacy through large series of single-case design experiments. 

00:04:25
ART JONGSMA So what you're saying here is, good group design or a series of single-cased design experiments were acceptable. 

00:04:30
Well-Established Treatments Additional Requirements Experiments must be conducted with treatment manuals Characteristics of samples must be specified The effects must be demonstrated by at least two different investigators or teams 

00:04:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Exactly. Yup. In addition to meeting either of these criteria, the Group required the experiments had to be conducted with treatment manuals on equivalent clear description of the treatment process, also characteristics of the samples had to be specified. And finally efficacy of the treatment had to be demonstrated by at least two different independent investigators or investigative teams. 

00:04:55
Probably Efficacious Criteria 1: Two experiments must show the treatment is superior to waiting-list control group Criteria 2: One or more experiments must meet Well-Established treatment criteria, except that the effects had not been demonstrated by two different investigators or teams 

00:04:55
ART JONGSMA Okay, now let's look at the Probably Efficacious category. For a treatment to be categorized as Probably Efficacious at least two experiments had to show that the treatment was superior to a waiting-list control group. Or if one or more of the experiments met the criteria we just discussed for Well-Established treatment, but its efficacy hadn't been demonstrated by at least two different investigators or teams, then it was classified as Probably Efficacious. Like the Criteria for Well-Established, a small series of single-cased design experiments meeting the criteria for Well-Established treatment could be used in place of group designs. 

00:05:35
Products of EST Reviews By 1996, 47 ESTs By 1998, 71 ESTs By 1999, Division 12 took ownership of list 

00:05:35
Society of Clinical Psychology American Psychological Association, Division 12 Website on Research-Supported Psychological Treatments www.PsychologicalTreatments.org 

00:05:35
DR. TIM BRUCE Now that we understand the specific criteria used to evaluate treatments, let's examine the products of EST reviews: by 1996 Division 12 had identified a preliminary list of 47 ESTs, by 1998 this list had grown to 71, then in 1999 Division 12 took full ownership of maintaining the growing list. The current list and information center can be found on its website. Around this same time other groups emerged using the same or similar criteria to review literatures within its other populations, problems and interventions. 

00:06:10
Children (Lonigan Elbert, 1998) Pediatric Psychology (Spirito, 1999) Older Adults (Gatz, 1998) Adult, Child, Marital, Family Therapy (Kendall & Chambliss, 1998) Psychopharmacology and Psychological Treatments (Nathan & Gorman, 1998, 2002, 2007) 

00:06:10
ART JONGSMA Here you see some examples of those reviews with EST research with various populations. 

00:06:15
DR. TIM BRUCE  Yeah, examples include Spirito's for Pediatric Psychology, Gatz's work regarding the elderly and, uh, Nathan & Gorman's with, uh, that include psychopharmacology in addition to psychosocial interventions. 

00:06:30
Websites to Note: www. nice.org.uk National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) www.nrepp.samhsa.gov National Registry of Evidence Based Programs Practices 

00:06:30
ART JONGSMA As we've mentioned, Great Britain was at the forefront of these efforts overseas. The latest products of their work can be found at the website of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Finally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration or SAMHSA has also began an initiative to evaluate, identify and provide information on various mental health practices, it's entitled the National Registry of Evidence Based Programs & Practices. Their work can also be found online. 

00:07:05
ART JONGSMA In this series, Tim and I draw from these works to show how clinicians can integrate into their treatment plans, goals, objectives and treatment interventions consistent with ESTs identified by many of these groups. 

00:07:20
Empirically Supported Psychological Treatments (EST) and Evidence Based Practice (EBP) 

00:07:20
Evidence-Based Practice "Integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences." American Psychological Association 

00:07:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Before we move on it might be helpful to place what we're doing in the of what has been termed Evidence Based Practice. It's important to note that empirically informing the psychotherapy treatment plan with objectives and interventions from empirically supported treatments or ESTs, is only part of providing an evidenced based practice of psychology or EBP. This is reflect the definition of Evidence-Based Practice advanced by the APA as the "integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences". 

00:07:55
ART JONGSMA  So, Evidence-Based Practice is broader than empirically supported treatments in that it indicates not just principles of ESTs, but these other considerations into clinical decision making. 

00:08:10
DR. TIM BRUCE Yes, so it's important to recognize that although this treatment planning series, by its nature is gonna emphasize the content of therapy, such as objectives and treatment interventions, other factors, such as those of the client, the therapist, the therapeutic relationship, have been shown to contribute to therapeutic outcome as well and should obviously be considered in the delivery of any psychotherapy treatment plan. 

00:08:35
ART JONGSMA For those interested in reading more about these issues references are provided in the workbook. 

00:08:40
Advantages of Using ESTs 

00:08:40
DR. TIM BRUCE Now let's take a quick look at some of the advantages and limitations of empirically informing treatment. Advantages of using empirically informed treatments have been identified at different levels of a psychotherapy service delivery system. Why don't we start with the advantages to the clients. Art? 

00:08:55
Advantages of Using ESTs Client Clinical benefit 

00:08:55
ART JONGSMA Well, participation in empirically informed therapy increases the confidence that there will be a clinical benefit, to the degree that the clients problem is reflective of clients in the studies that support an EST. The client knows that others have benefited and it's likely that he or she may too. 

00:09:15
DR. TIM BRUCE  And so Art, what are the advantages to the clinician? 

00:09:20
Advantages of Using ESTs Client Clinical benefit Clinician Accountability Ethical Consideration Practical Consideration Protection 

00:09:20
ART JONGSMA Well, first of all, clinicians can document for reviewers or payers that they're using a treatment approach with demonstrated efficacy. Secondly, clinicians too can feel confident that they're using a treatment approach that has demonstrated efficacy. They're treating their client in a fully informed, professional and ethical manner. And then thirdly, there are practical considerations. Many ESTs have defined emphases so treatment can remain focused. Many ESTs have a therapist and client manual, making it easier to delineate objectives and interventions. Finally, using treatments with demonstrated efficacy affords some protection from malpractice, although no legal precedents have been set that we are aware of, using ESTs is likely to mitigate against claims against negligence in selections of therapeutic interventions. 

00:10:15
Advantages of Using ESTs Agency Supports high quality care Increases likelihood of reimbursements Competitiveness Justifies future funding requests Brings the results of research to practitioners and their clients Enhances the reputation of psychotherapy in healthcare General Population Improved quality of healthcare 

00:10:15
DR. TIM BRUCE Advantages are also found at the level of the clinical agency. For example, the use of ESTs supports most agencies goal of delivering quality care. From the administrative prospective it increases the likelihood of reimbursements and it's also likely to improve a business competitiveness of the agency. From the prospective of the profession, empirically informed treatment justifies the use of dollars and efforts that have been invested in clinical research, as well as future requests for funding. It can help reduce the scientist-practitioner gap by bringing useful products from clinical research to practitioners in the field. It also strengthens the role, and reputation of therapy within the healthcare field in general. Finally, at the national policy level, bringing advances gained through research to consumers of psychotherapy services, holds a promise of advancing the quality of healthcare of the population in general. 

00:11:10
Limitations of Using ESTs 

00:11:10
ART JONGSMA While recognizing these advantages of identifying and using ESTs, it's also important to understand their limitations. One limitations is that the literature supporting the designation of treatments as empirically supported are not equally advanced. That is, the levels of evidence supporting the ESTs are not the same. One distinction that has come out of this discussion has been whether studies supporting a particular EST have demonstrated efficacy, effectiveness, and utility. So Tim, let's look at each of these concepts in more detail. 

00:11:45
Efficacy The systematic and scientific evaluation of whether a treatment works 

00:11:45
DR. TIM BRUCE Sure, let's start with efficacy. Efficacy refers to the systematic and scientific evaluation of whether a treatment works. Efficacy studies aim to control for alternative explanations of a therapeutic outcome. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of a medication is an example of efficacy study. These are the kinds of studies that Division 12 used in their criteria for a well-established treatment. Their designed to identify whether a positive outcome is achieved, and ideally, whether it's due to the unique features of a therapy under investigation. Literature supporting ESTs that contain a high number of high quality randomized controlled trials are in a better position to conclude that the treatment is actually efficacious, and that this efficacy is due specifically to the treatment, uh, intervention under study. Evidence bases that lack these types of studies are not able to support this type of conclusion. 

00:12:45
ART JONGSMA Can you give us an example of this? 

00:12:45
DR. TIM BRUCE Sure. It's been argued that the, uh, research supporting the use of exposure based therapies for anxiety disorders is advanced enough to conclude that this type of intervention works, and that the technique of exposure is necessary to that outcome. Research, uh, results supporting other ESTs though may have demonstrated a favorable outcome, but where not advanced enough to conclude that the effects due to the treatments unique ingredients. 

00:13:10
ART JONGSMA So how about an example of a therapy that has research support, but it's limited in terms of the conclusions we can draw from it. 

00:13:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Right, sure. An example of an empirically supported treatment that has met the criteria for Probably Efficacious is, uh, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing for PTSD. Uhm, Although the treatment has demonstrated efficacy in some studies, it has yet to be demonstrated whether and what unique factors of EMDR are responsible for a clients improvement. 

00:13:40
Limitations of Using ESTs Not all ESTs have the same level of support for their efficacy 

00:13:40
ART JONGSMA So, one limitation here is that not all ESTs have the same level of support for their efficacy and this limits conclusions, not about their efficacy, but about whether they can claim that the efficacy is a result of ingredients unique to that treatment. So, how does the concept of effectiveness play into this? 

00:14:05
Effectiveness Test whether a treatments efficacy extends to actual clinical setting with natural client populations 

00:14:05
DR. TIM BRUCE Well, while efficacy studies tried to test whether a treatment works due to its unique interventions, effectiveness studies tests whether a treatments efficacy extends to the actual clinical setting with natural client populations, that is it's real world application if you will. For example, a treatment showing efficacy for a particular problem with a particular sample of clients, in research study, may or may not show similar efficacy when delivered to clients in the natural setting with all of its complexities. 

00:14:35
ART JONGSMA And what about the clinical utility studies? What do they add to this EST mix? 

00:14:40
Clinical Utility The applicability, feasibility, and practical usefulness of the intervention in the local or specific setting where it is offered 

00:14:40
DR. TIM BRUCE Well clinical utility is an extension of effectiveness, and it refers to the applicability, but also the feasibility, and practical usefulness of the intervention in the local or specific setting where its offered. 

00:14:50
ART JONGSMA And, how do these clinical utility studies evaluate these practical considerations? 

00:15:00
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, good question. Evaluations of utility might include things like, cost considerations for implementing the treatment, training requirements for staff, ease of documentation, things like that. 

00:15:10
ART JONGSMA So what are the most prevalent types of these studies? Efficacy, effectiveness or clinical utility? 

00:15:15
Limitations of Using ESTs Not all ESTs have the same level of support for their efficacy Effectiveness and utility of some ESTs has not been studied extensively 

00:15:15
DR. TIM BRUCE Yeah, well that's the limitation. They're clearly more efficacy studies than effectiveness and utility studies supporting identified ESTs. So the effectiveness and utility, or that is, the generalized ability or transportability of some ESTs has not been studied extensively. 

00:15:35
ART JONGSMA The criteria used by EST reviewers has focused on efficacy, right? 

00:15:40
"The content of this list [of ESTs]is restricted in at least two notable ways: First, our focus is on what is often termed efficacy rather than effectiveness. That is, we concentrate here on demonstrations that a treatment is beneficial for patients or clients in well-controlled treatment studies. Effectiveness studies are of importance as well: these include studies of how well an efficacious treatment can be transported from the research clinic to community and private practice settings. Once the task force has more comprehensively covered the efficacy literature, we expect to broach the subject of effectiveness." (Chambless et al., 1998). 

00:15:40
DR. TIM BRUCE Yes, by intent. In fact, the original Division 12 groups stated this: "The content of this list [of ESTs]is restricted in at least two notable ways. First, our focus is on what is often termed efficacy rather than effectiveness. That is, we concentrate here on demonstrations that a treatment is beneficial for patients or clients in well-controlled treatment studies. Effectiveness studies are of importance as well: these include studies of how well and efficacious treatment can be transported from the research clinic to community and private practice settings. Once the task force has more comprehensively covered the efficacy literature, we expect to broach the subject of effectiveness." 

00:16:20
ART JONGSMA So, where is effectiveness research these days? 

00:16:20
Effectiveness Studies Organista KC, Munoz RF, Gonzalez G. 1994. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression in low-income and minority medical outpatients: description of a program and exploratory analyses. Cogn. Ther. Res. 18:241-59 Persons JB, Bostrom A, Bertagnolli A. 1999. Results of randomized controlled trials of cognitive therapy for depression generalize to private practice. Cogn. Ther.

00:16:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Well, some effectiveness studies were already in print when the EST movement began, but over the last decade did become much more prevalent. Here is some examples of effectiveness studies, you can see in their titles the focus on things like transportability or generalizability to the community setting. There are others in the workbook for those that are interested. Today most of the major federally funded studies of efficacious psychotherapies attend effectiveness considerations in their designs. It's notable that several of these types of studies have supported the generalizability of the ESTs identified to the initial efficacy reviews. But not without some differences in outcomes in some studies. For example, some have shown higher dropout rates in the community studies, or the need for longer treatment to get the outcome, and some have shown significant improvement but the overall quality of the improvement might have been less than what was found in the efficacy studies. 

00:17:15
ART JONGSMA So, can we say that this is a work in progress? 

00:17:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Yes, and an important one. 

00:17:20
ART JONGSMA Beyond these research related issues there have been objections to placing so much emphasis on the technique, or content of therapy. Tim, tell us about the voice of those that do place these emphases. 

00:17:30
Beyond the Content of an EST 

00:17:30
"The client, the therapist, and the therapeutic relationship are among factors that also contribute to effective treatment. In providing information on research-supported psychological treatments we do not intend to devalue the importance of these other factors." 

00:17:30
DR. TIM BRUCE  Mhmm, sure. You know another criticism of the effort to identify EST charges that it downplays the importance of other factors involved in the delivery of psychotherapy, some of which of have been known to contribute to therapeutic outcome. Examples include factors related to the client, the therapist, the relationship and the like. Of course, EST review groups acknowledged that their efforts are only part of the equation in determining therapeutic outcome. You can see that in this statement by the Division 12 site that disseminates ESTs. It states that "The client, the therapist, and the therapeutic relationship are among factors that also contribute to effective treatment. In providing information on research-supported psychological treatments we do not intend to devalue the importance of these other factors." 

00:18:20
ART JONGSMA Didn't the Psychotherapy Division of APA first highlight this issue? 

00:18:25
Empirically Supported Relationship Variables (ESRs) 

00:18:25
DR. TIM BRUCE Yes, uh, they did. You know Division 29 took up the effort to identify empirically supported relationship variables or ESRs, and you can find references to that research in your workbook. 

00:18:35
ART JONGSMA  I think it's fair to say, that although early discussions of these issues were the topic of sometimes polarizing debate, recent attempts have been made to look at how content, process, and other factors can be brought into the evidence-based practice that reflects their contributions. 

00:18:55
Principles of Therapeutic Change That Work 

00:18:55
DR. TIM BRUCE Yes, one example of the approach you described Art, is the recent movement to identify principles of therapeutic change that may be reflected in identified ESTs and ESRs. 

00:19:05
ART JONGSMA  This type integration is what's reflected in APAs definitions of evidence-based practice. 

00:19:15
Evidence-Based Practice "Integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences." American Psychological Association 

00:19:15
DR. TIM BRUCE Exactly. Which as we've discussed early states that evidence-based practice is the "integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences." 

00:19:25
ART JONGSMA So, how can a clinician arrive at an evidence-based practice? 

00:19:30
EBP as an Integration Conduct a thorough assessment/diagnostics/case formulation Stay up on the EST and ESR literature Empirically inform you treatment with applicable ESTs Deliver treatment with sensitivity toward ESR considerations Continuously monitor outcomes Use a scientist-practitioner, hypothesis-testing approach 

00:19:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Good question. Uhm, what's been recommended is to start with a thorough assessment/case formulation/ diagnostics, stay up on the EST and ESR literature and its potential application to you client, empirically inform your treatment with applicable ESTs, um, which is what we are gonna be highlighting in this series obviously, deliver treat with sensitivity ESR considerations, continuously monitor outcomes, and use a scientist-practitioner, hypothesis-testing approach to maximize outcome. 

00:20:00
ART JONGSMA  For those interested in farther readings on these issues, references to them are provided in your workbook. With this background in mind, let's move on to the purpose of this series: To demonstrate the process of empirically-informed psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health problems. 

00:20:20
Six Steps to a Treatment Plan Identify Primary & Secondary Problems Describe Behavioral Definitions Diagnosis Based on DSM/ICD Criteria Specify Long-term Goals Create Short-term Objectives Select Treatment Interventions 

00:20:20
Identify Primary & Secondary Problems 

00:20:20
Primary Problem: Depression 

00:20:20
ART JONGSMA We begin with a discussion of the six major steps involved in developing a psychotherapy treatment plan. Let's look at each one of those steps and provide some detail. Step one is to identify primary and secondary problems. A client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment, but as a first step in creating a treatment plan, the clinician must determine what the most significant problem or problems are, often by assessing which are the most related to current distress, disability, or both. Usually a primary problem will surface, and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with few identified problems or treatment will lose its direction. For example, the primary problem could be identified as depression. 

00:21:20
Describe Behavioral Definitions 

00:21:20
DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS Fourth Edition TEXT REVISION DSM-IV-TR 

00:21:20
Primary Problem: Depression Behavioral Definition: 1. Sad thoughts and affect 2. Decrease interest 3. Lack of energy 4. Difficulty concentrating and decision making 5. Decreased appetite 6. Sleep disturbance Long Term Goal: 1. Alleviate depressive symptoms and return to previous level of effective function 

00:21:20
DR. TIM BRUCE Now we move on to step two: describing the behavioral definitions of the problem. Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave or interact will be to some degree unique to them and their situation. So each problem that is selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how it is manifesting in your particular client. Therefore, as a second step in treatment planning, the behavioral definition of the problem or the behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal features of the problem are specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria such as those found in the DSM or the ICD, which should be kept in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. For our example, the manifestations of depression could be: sad thoughts and affect , decreased interest, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, decreased appetite, and sleep disturbance. 

00:22:20
Diagnosis Based on DSM/ICD Criteria 

00:22:20
One Note Not all therapists use psychiatric diagnosis to formulate treatment plans, but instead focus on: Changes in problem behavior Cognition Emotions 

00:22:20
Diagnosis: (296.22) Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate 

00:22:20
ART JONGSMA  The third step in treatment planning; the determination of an appropriate diagnosis is based on an evaluation of the clients complete clinical presentation. The clinician must compare their behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal features causing distress or disability to the criteria of the diagnosis in a mental health disorder in DSM or ICD. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnosis , per se, in formulating their treatment plans, but instead they prefer to focus on changes in identified problem behavior, cognition, emotions, and the like. Having said that, most third party payers require a diagnosis, and most ESTs are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems. So, it's usually necessary to make a diagnosis. For our depression example, the DSM diagnosis selected could be 296.22, Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate. 

00:23:30
Specify Long-term Goals 

00:23:30
Long Term Goal: 1. Alleviate depressive symptoms and return to previous level of effective functioning. 

00:23:30
DR. TIM BRUCE Step four in developing a treatment plan is to set long-term goals for the resolution of clients primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted in measureable terms but can be more broad in indicated desired general positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. A goal for depression could be: alleviate depressive symptoms and return to previous level of effective functioning. 

00:24:00
Create Short-term Objectives 

00:24:00
Short-Term Objectives 1. Identify and replace cognitive self-talk that is engaged in to support depression. 2. Utilize behavioral strategies to overcome depression. 3. Increase assertive communication. 

00:24:00
ART JONGSMA Writing short-term objectives for the client to achieve is step five in developing a treatment plan. In contrast to long-term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measureable or observable terms. Clearly stated objectives are helpful to both the therapist and the client in assessing progress. They are also important to quality assurance review agencies, health maintenance organizations, and managed-care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objectives should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. Three short-term objectives for depression could be: 1. Identify and replace cognitive self-talk that is engaged in to support depression. 2. Utilize behavioral strategies to overcome depression. 3. Increase assertive communication. 

00:24:55
Select Treatment Interventions 

00:24:55
Short-Term Objectives 1. Identify and replace cognitive self-talk that is engaged in to support depression. 1. Assign the client to keep a daily journal of automatic thoughts associated with depressive feelings, process the journal material to challenge depressive thinking patterns and replace them with reality-based thoughts. 2. Utilize behavioral strategies to overcome depression. 1. Engage the client in "behavioral activation" by scheduling activities that have a high likelihood for pleasure and master, use rehearsal, role-playing, role reversal, as needed, to assist adoption in the client's daily life, reinforcing success. 3.

DR. TIM BRUCE Interventions are the actions of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives. Selecting the appropriate therapists interventions is sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least on intervention planned for every client objective. If a client does not accomplish the objective after the initial interventions have been implemented, new interventions should be considered in the plan. So for the first short-term objective in our example, we could assign the client to keep a daily journal of automatic thoughts associate with depressive feelings, to process the journal material, to identify, challenge, and ultimately change depressive thinking patterns. We can engage the client in "behavioral activation" by scheduling activities that have a high likelihood of pleasure and mastery, use, uh, rehearsal or role-playing or role reversal as needed to assist adoption in the client's daily life, reinforcing the success as they progress. To help increase assertive communication, we might use modeling or role-playing psychoeducation to train these skills, if indicated, you might refer him or her to an assertive training class for further instruction.

Primary Problem: Depression 

00:26:00
ART JONGSMA When we combine all of the elements of our sample plan, we have beginning treatment plan for depression that looks like this. From what we've just described, it may sound like this is a pretty cut-and-dried process, and that you just simply repeat the process with every client, but that's really not the case. One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual clients unique problems, strengths, and needs. Treatment plans should not be boiler-plate, even if clients have similar problems. The individual strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, cultural and social network, family circumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing a treatment strategy. Clinicians should rely on their own good clinical judgment and select interventions that are appropriate for the distinctive individual with whom they are working.

Integrating ESTs into Treatment Planning

Six Steps to a Treatment Plan Identify Primary & Secondary Problems Describe Behavioral Definitions Diagnosis Based on DSM/ICD Criteria 

00:27:00
Primary Problem: Depression Behavioral Definition: 1. Sad thoughts and affect 2. Decreased interest 3. Lack of energy 4. Difficulty concentrating and decision making 5. Decreased appetite 6. Sleep disturbance 

00:27:00
DR. TIM BRUCE  Now empirically informing this treatment plan that we've just described involves integrating those aspects of identified ESTs for the problem into each step of the treatment planning process. Once you've identified your clients problem, specified its behavioral definition or symptom manifestations and arrived at a diagnosis, you then determine if it has been the subject of an EST study. For our example of depression, we know that cognitive and behavioral therapies are identified ESTs.

Six Steps to a Treatment Plan Specify Long-term Goals Create Short-term Objectives Select Treatment Interventions 

00:27:30
Long Term Goal 1. Alleviate depressed mood and return to previous level of effective functioning Short-Term Objectives Therapeutic Interventions 1. Identify and replace cognitive self-talk that is engaged in to support depression. 1. Assign the client to keep a daily journal of automatic thoughts associated with depressive feelings, process the journal material to challenge depressive thinking patterns and replace them with reality-based thoughts. 2. Utilize behavioral strategies to overcome depression. 1. Engage the client in "behavioral activation" by scheduling activities that have a high likelihood for pleasure and master, use rehearsal, role-playing, role reversal, as needed, to assist adoption in the client's daily life, reinforcing success. 3. Increase assertive communication. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Use modeling and/or role-playing to train the client in assertiveness training class for further instruction.

ART JONGSMA Accordingly, we included long-term goals, or Step 4 of the treatment planning process, short-term objectives, or Step 5, and therapist interventions, Step 6 , that are consistent with those of identified ESTs as you can see here. 

00:27:45
DR. TIM BRUCE  It's important to note that the research supporting ESTs supports the identified treatments as they were delivered in the original research studies. The use of only selected objectives or interventions may not be supported. So if you want to incorporate in the EST into your treatment plan, it should reflect the major objectives and interventions of the approach. Most treatment manuals, books and other training tools identify what these are. 

00:28:10
ART JONGSMA Today we've provided you with enough general introduction into empirically-informed psychotherapy treatment planning, including: the history of the movement to identify ESTs; its advantages and limitations; the essential steps involved in treatment planning; and how to empirically inform the treatment planning process with goals, objectives and interventions, consistent with identified ESTs. In other programs we'll demonstrate how this process can be applied specific problems or disorders, such as: depression, panic disorder, and social anxiety.

DVD COMPANION WORKBOOK Evidence-Based Psychotherapy Treatment Planning 

00:28:45
DR. TIM BRUCE  As we've said before, the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of empirically informing psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health and substance abuse problems. It's designed to be informational in nature and does not intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed and demonstrated. For those interested in learning more about empirically-supported treatments discussed, references to their empirical support, clinical training materials, and training opportunities are provided in the workbook accompanying each DVD. We hope this information will assist you in helping your clients live more happy and productive lives.
