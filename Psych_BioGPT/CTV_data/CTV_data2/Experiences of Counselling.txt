Counsellor and Psychotherapist 

00:00:35
MAUREEN MOORE Hello and welcome to this discussion. We are going to be looking at people's experiences of counselling. All the members of the group have experienced counselling at some stage in their lives. Clients, like counsellors are very different and therefore it is very important for someone looking for a counsellor with whom they're going to share intimate secrets. To find the right person that will suit them and will meet their expectations. I wonder Mary, would you just share with us something of way in which you chose your counsellor and what that was like? 

00:01:25
MARY PRIEST—COBERN Once I decided to umm… go for counselling umm… a friend of mine advised me to actually umm… interview a series of counsellors to actually find the one that I felt I could work with and so umm… she actually told me about one counsellor that she had worked with and so, I rang her up and made an appointment and then I found umm… two other counsellors. One through a journal and one through another friend and I made an appointment and I had three separate sessions. Umm… they were two women and a man and umm… I was dealing with bereavement, so I really felt like umm… they were all lovely people. But I felt like, the man was a little bit more challenging for me to actually work with a man. So I actually chose a man and umm… I really pleased I did because it umm… was challenging but really helpful. To find the right counsellor was really, really helpful because I wouldn't have carried on with counselling unless I found somebody that I really felt intuitively that I could umm… feel safe to work with. And feel that they could really listen to me and help me actually deal with the issues. 

00:02:45
BILL HAWKINS I did the same thing with, I work for, I thought a man will be best because, I felt like my kind of conflicts were to deal with, uh, you know, fathers and men and how they relate to other men and if it is a man or woman, there is gonna be a different dynamic. And by working out with a man, you can work out, you know, how you relate to each other and, and what is like to, to go through that experience with that person. And, I think, I think, it was better for me in that of my life. 

00:03:15
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah, that's very interesting. 

00:03:15
EMMALINE MAXWELL Yes, I am. I interviewed two counsellors as well and I, I interviewed a man and a woman and went a long for a session each. And, uh, but I felt that at that point in time, I needed to speak to a woman. Umm… so but, the other chap was really sweet and kind and he didn't mind at all. He's really open about it and didn't mind that, I needed to go and umm… have a woman as my counsellor, so yeah. It was great. 

00:03:45
MAUREEN MOORE All right, were there any other issues that came up for people choosing their counsellors? 

00:03:50
DIPTI SHAH Yes, I think for me umm… it would have to be somebody I felt connected to and somebody who I felt would understand me. So umm… I, I went to somebody who umm… the first counsellor I found, I didn't really connect with. Umm… and I didn't feel that she quite understood me as a person. Umm… so I looked for another one and the second one, I felt very comfortable with. So that was really for me, how I umm… chose my counsellor. 

00:04:25
DANIEL BARKER And there is that everybody seems to have chosen a counsellor and they had something in their mind. With me, when I came to choose my counsellor, I was, I just had problems and I thought, well, I would like to speak to somebody and I really didn't care who they were. And I spoke to a colleague who happen to be a counsellor with their help that he would get me a counsellor that will help me out and he was one who talked to me and we did click. But I didn't have in mind a particular person. I just wanted someone to listen to what I had to say. 

00:05:00
SHEENA SHAH Yeah, that was the same with me. When I went and to see my first counsellor right so, I had a completely open mind and went in and spoke and she wasn't the right counsellor for me, because there was a there were loads of silent moments, so to speak and, and I just couldn't get my head around these periods of silence. And, but I just found another counsellor who talked more with me about issues. 

00:05:25
MAUREEN MOORE Right, so between you, you have chosen counsellors to meet your requirements, it's used to do with men, the meeting, thinking that you would like to, to work with a man. Something about connectedness and you being a person. For you, it was just someone who met your needs, who could respond and help you with your problems. And, and you were aware that you, you wanted a more active, fun, kind of interaction. So having chosen this person, what was the first session like? That can be quite, quite challenging. 

00:06:10
DANIEL BARKER For me, the session almost started with my speaking to him. Because he was, tell me a little bit what your problem is, and I'll think about a counsellor for you. And I did begin to talk to him but I guess there was five minutes into it, you begin to think to yourself, hey I'm exposing all myself to this individual. Now, this individual didn't know me personally but we did work in the same organization. So, it was a feeling, do I keep talking, do I shut up? But he did make me feel very comfortable and I did feel that he was genuine and he was listening to me, what I had to say to him mattered and that's what's important to me at that time. 

00:06:50
DIPTI SHAH I can relate to that. I think, I was umm… once I started talking, once I've made up my mind that I was going to talk I suddenly then felt, hey can this person really understand what I'm talking about and can they cope with what I have to tell them. Umm… but I was made to feel very comfortable and contained and, umm…and therefore, I carried on talking about the issues. 

00:07:20
BILL HAWKINS I felt like, I was quite on the spot a little bit. I didn't know what to do and he kind of didn't really provide any guidelines, you just, you kind of, everything I did was kind of almost, uh, analyzed in question. It was provided new material like why did I choose to sit rather than lie down and, and if I wasn't saying anything and why was I nervous about that at all. Should I be nervous or if I was asking him, he wasn't saying anything. He kind of, so then you can either start this whole kind of relationship of analyzing what it's like for you to be in a room together, I suppose. It was, it was quite awkward but then, uh, he said, you know, why did you choose to sit down and I went, you know, maybe I should lie down and embrace this fully rather than being very British and standoffish and awkward. Let's get down to business. 

00:08:05
MAUREEN MOORE That's interesting. 

00:08:10
EMMALINE MAXWELL My counsellor in the first session umm… really was like, as soon as you, kind of went in, I didn't know, where I was gonna start with anything that I said. So umm… but she was very good. She sort of let it to begin with. So she, sort of helped me start talking and umm… and she would sort of guide me. Bit of challenges here and there about things I said, some things as I didn't even aware of the language that I used would be sort of shown back at me, is it say and, and why did you say it like that and I'd think, oh, golly. So, you know, some surprises along the way, but, it just, helped to get things going. So the second session was a lot easier and umm… went on from there really. 

00:09:00
MARY PRIEST—COBERN I found the first session, I just had so much to say, I just kind of started to, you know, just, well I'll bring you up to date with my story, you know. And, you know, I was like really proactive in, you know, engaging, you know, to the point where I could just see, you know, the nodding going on and then a few questions, you know, and then I just thought, okay, I'm not here to entertain this person. You know, I'm not here to umm… I'm here to actually, you know be able to talk through what I have to say but I want to bring you up to date, you know and that was interesting part is that umm… you know, he, he listened to me but also he was more than listening. He was actually umm… watching my body language and kind of giving some response back that actually kind of made me pause and actually reflect umm… how, you know, how we are more than what we say and that how we are, you know, that our whole package is part of how we interface in the world. And that was, you know, and the kind of, in a subtle way, one other thing that I really found interesting too was actually when I left the session umm… to the next, to the next session, I felt like, in my dreams and I was like replaying the session for, you know, it was like, it was intense little kind of cameo and I was replaying it, and replaying it and I, I just felt like I had probably done more out of the chair than in the chair, so to speak which was kind of weird for a new experience, you know. But it did umm… yeah. I don't know. 

00:10:50
BILL HAWKINS Just take it… just take that week or two, kind of settle because you're gonna shake everything up and looking at all and then, and then kind of cement yourself each week, where you're gonna start make something out of it. I just doesn't imagine it really have until, afterwards, I suppose, immediately, you know, a day or two afterwards and you start to, you start to feel, you start to notice the change. 

00:11:10
MAUREEN MOORE So, it's a kind of process that part of which happens during the session but a large part of it happens in between session. 

00:11:20
BILL HAWKINS Yeah, it happens even when we're not thinking about it, you're still, at the back of your mind, you're working, you're working out what was raised and, and because the things because of the layout in the session, things you never usually consider thinking about or talking openly about or literally laying out somebody else and when you do that, it's, it's quite, quite kind of, uh, not, it's difficult and it will shake you up. You are really feeling a bit like, well, and but then over the next few days and you become familiar with those things. You rose up and you kind of… they are so much more accepting of, you feel much more honest with yourself because you're much more confident and to kind of go back and carry on. 

00:12:05
MAUREEN MOORE One things that's interesting, that's occurred quite with all that has been said, is that, in one way or another, all the different counsellors have raised your awareness of yourself, either by reflecting the words in your case umm… you know, you said that you became aware that you wanted to talk about and talk more and you said you were, you were conscious of what was happening and you were, even conscious of whether you wanted to lie down or sit, you know, that's physical awareness. 

00:12:40
BILL HAWKINS Yeah. 

00:12:40
MAUREEN MOORE That seemed a very kind of basic place to start. 

00:12:40
BILL HAWKINS Yeah. 

00:12:40
MAUREEN MOORE And you talked about self-awareness as well. Did you find that with your first session? 

00:12:50
SHEENA SHAH Umm… well, I was just really nervous because I didn't know how much, I wanted to let someone else know about my own life. Umm… so I think I held back a lot which is why my first counsellor, it didn't work for me because she didn't push me to get any information out of me. Umm… but when I went from my first meeting with my second counsellor umm… through her talking more umm… and so asking me more questions, I opened up a lot more. And, forgot most of all what she said, when I walked out. But over the next couple of days, I started going back to what had been said during our meeting. 

00:13:25
DANIEL BARKER I think, I was looking for something different with the first session. I thought to myself, well, is this gonna be what they say a counsellor, you know, somebody comes in spills out a lot of jargon to me and tells me what Freud and what my dreams mean. But it didn't happen like that and I actually noticed during the time that the person was listening to what I had to say. He was agreeing and he was doing things that I didn't think a counsellor would do. This particular individual would do, he smiled, he, you know, made a joke with something, that was really going on for you, jeez that's not too good, isn't it, we want that. And it felt good for me because it met my personality. But you also gave me things to think about, you know, he would say, okay, Let me get this clear, let me get that clear and when he did clarify things, you may stop and think, just that how long have you coming across, is that, what you're saying, maybe I need to think about this. So but, I think if it had been someone else and not particular individual, then I don't know because my idea would be the stereotype, laying on a sofa and listen to somebody, where they took notes and they sprouted theorems to you, or theories or whatever. But the thing is that, it didn't happen like that. He was a human being as well as, I was concerned that as well as I was concerned they're far could relate to him and that's what I think I would have definitely needed. If I didn't have that the first go, I think, I just would have walked away. 

00:15:00
Part 2: Developing the Counselling Relationship 

00:15:10
MAUREEN MOORE And this leads nicely into the umm… next question or that you see that I would like to put to you all again, what was it like then talking to a counsellor over a period of time? In case, you have your first session but then this is got to go on possibly for a few weeks but the time varies. 

00:15:30
DANIEL BARKER For me, I think, it was, it became, not nerve wrecking, I think challenging would be the word. It became very, very challenging to the point that some weeks, I thought to myself, can I stand this person showing me more about myself. But I think, it was because my counsellor said, well, we're gonna discuss what's happening with you but I'm here to help you to move on. Now, I think, if it was that him being there that, you know, gave me the courage, I guess to actually come back to next session and the sessions after that. But for me, it was extremely challenging because I've thought myself to be an entirely different type of person and when you start showing me something else, then that puts a whole lot of my life, what I did into a different perspective. So, yes, it was, the more it went on, the more challenging it became. But the more you were beginning to learn and the more you were beginning to see. 

00:16:35
EMMALINE MAXWELL My, my counsellor umm… sort of told me in the beginning, sort of process that we'd go through. So it was really clear and umm… and we even did sort of mind maps and little family maps and, you know, sort of my own personal life map of where I thought I was to start with and, and then umm… sort of by the end of it, I think we do it again, to see, however thing fitted together by the end and how I felt things have changed. So it really was a nice umm… not a circle but, it was a nice little rounding off towards the end. 

00:17:10
MAUREEN MOORE So there was a beginning and an end. 

00:17:15
EMMALINE MAXWELL There was a process and there was an end, yeah. So, I felt like I had gone there, you know, spilled all the beans about everything and, and gone through the process, you know, painful at times, tearful at times but funny as well and umm… and guided and safe, you know. You know, she almost seems like a friend, really by the end because she shared a lot with me and umm… and helped me through it, so. Yeah. 

00:17:45
SHEENA SHAH I think, that's why I liked going to see my counsellor because umm… once a week, I could go and sort of let off, so let everything that happened during the week or anything that I wasn't sure about, I could sort of let it go and work through it with someone outside to the house. And which is really good. And umm… also, she didn't, she won't give me answers to anything. I would work them out for myself which is also really good because it's then you're not like you're going somewhere to be told, do this or do that. You sort of come to whatever, you want to do yourself. 

00:18:20
BILL HAWKINS Yeah, I remember that. It's like a kind of, don't know what the word is, but my first, I remember the first I went there, it was raining and it was gray and it was dark and it was winter. I was like, God, what am I doing walking in here, looking for help? I mean, I went for anyway and but then, I mean, six months later and the last I ever went, I was a bit upset about it because you do get quite, you just have to relate with that person and, you know, they don't know, each of these till, still know everything about you. And they genuinely helped you. So you feel a connection but and I didn't have it from going but when I started, it was like a completely clear sky and all the clouds were gone. It's like kind of like, God, I feel like, I'm in a film, you know. It's absolutely perfect. For that stage, it did feel like that. But, yeah, over the course of, more you go back, you start to kind of, I don't know, towards the end, you kind of, I felt like there was umm… you know, there is almost like a limit, I don't think, I could go as far as I could and I thought, I wasn't comfortable going to that kind of far into, into how it work into my weaknesses, you know, but then, I think eventually, you come, you kind of want to, truly know your weaknesses because it, even though, it's difficult to break, get through that barrier than, you just feel stronger for it. You really do. Because you're being honest with yourself, I guess. 

00:19:45
MAUREEN MOORE So you, you, you speak about the relationship that developed from the fact that it was difficult for you to end the relationship that you had. 

00:19:50
EMMALINE MAXWELL Well, although at the same time, it's very, it's empowering isn't it? The counsellor is there umm… kind of helping you umm… you know, and you feel more empowered. So umm… they're not doing everything for you. They're just helping you to do it yourself and so, then you feel strong enough and more confident and, you feel much better to go out in the world and, and continue your life, you know, so. 

00:20:15
BILL HAWKINS And if you can talk to them about how you feel about, you know, not seeing them again, then you straight away, it's like, you got something to talk about is say something about, who you are, depending on how, you know, how it affects you to leave that person, you're close to, especially, if it's a man, for instance, you really have, so, you know, you lost a dad or your parents got split off or something, you immediately are touching on it again and you can even say that in the last one. They can go look, you should look it like this or what did that say, how does it feel compared to how it felt six months ago. 

00:20:45
MARY PRIEST—COBERN Now, I found that leaving was difficult and I had a long term counsellor, you know, for five years. And umm… it was a special, I mean, it was within the boundary, you know, but that person, I felt like knew me more than anybody on this whole planet because, you know, was a relationship, that was absolutely dedicated to me, for me. And, I remember, you know, sometimes, you know, you go through a different journey as you do on any relationship. Sometimes you just think, you get a little bored and you think, oh my God, you know. And so, is it still working for me, I'm paying for it. And umm… but then, you know, you get to the point where you think, well actually, it's time to move on and that actually takes a lot of courage to be able to do that, you know, and to be able to say and I know, I found it really emotional to have to actually say bye-bye, you know. But I may not, what I really appreciated was that umm… this person actually did said, you know the doors ajar and you can come back at anytime, should you want to, should you need to. It wasn't like, this relationship is in a bottle or sewerage now. But actually this relationship is, is part of, you know your journey and that it's some, it's valued and just to really feel that the relationship isn't that, you're just on a conveyor belt going in there, seeing somebody and there is somebody waiting in the queue, you know, and that, you know, what I mean, which is kind of difficult, you know. But is that, actually umm… you've developed a relationship in actually that sharing and that the counsellor is a human being, who is trying to actually listen but actually has feelings as well and. 

00:22:40
BILL HAWKINS Who cares about you, especially care about that. 

00:22:40
MARY PRIEST—COBERN And who really cares about you, yeah. And that is like, wow. That's actually something special in the world. And that is a real gift to actually have that, you know. 

00:22:50
DIPTI SHAH I guess, I'm thinking about my own journey towards the end and what I really learnt from my counsellor was that umm… she helped me to become aware that I was really important and I could manage. I did, you know she was there to prop me up. But at the end, I was strong enough to go on my own journey and, I could, I could actually say good-bye. Umm… with pleasure and pain and that's, you know, that was really empowering for me. 

00:23:25
MAUREEN MOORE It's interesting, the, the issue or the umm… mention of paying someone to listen has come up in the group and I've often the thought that there is quite a difference well that could seem to be quite a difference between paying someone to listen and having someone in your own family, perhaps a grandparent or an uncle or aunt or even a parent who listens for free and the perception that the relationship or the type of care will be different. And the reality is that once you experience counselling, the care and the understanding that you receive from the counsellor it is so intense that the issue of money and payment doesn't come into it. 

00:24:20
DIPTI SHAH Yes. I, I think it, it becomes almost as essential as eating or you know, because that's the nourishment, it's the emotional nourishment umm… that was lacking in my life. And money didn't matter, it didn't count because that's what I needed, to carry on and find myself. 

00:24:40
BILL HAWKINS And it's worth paying for. It's worth paying for because there is different type of listening. I mean, there is listening with a, when you know somebody, already, you know, will have this context for them and, it's personal and you have your opinions about each other and you have a kind of, you kind of, that kind of very personal relationship, compared to somebody who has professional training and is objective and, is thinking about everything you're saying and, and helping you direct yourself and really, you're basically, you're completely selfless, they're listening to you. Whereas you won't get that anywhere else because you're paying for that selflessness pretty or not. Superb activity which is, I mean, I mean, you gonna have to pay for that, it really on you. You can have nobody from any where else unless, they reached it for free. 

00:25:25
MARY PRIEST—COBERN And it's an investment too. It's an investment on your own self and your being and also, you know, like, dealing with the issues that you found, you know, there is a reason for going and you go with umm… and it's, if you can do it or you know, it's not for everybody but for people I found who was really an investment and it did empower me to find my voice through a very difficult time. 

00:25:55
BILL HAWKINS They do it for free counselling in a lot of places which is why, so you get things take advantage of, because, it's, you know, it's like free medicine or something. 

00:26:05
DANIEL BARKER And when I thought about was that it was, you know, you had to pay. I did think about, you know, we're going to a friend, you're speaking to a friend, and speaking to a relative but it wasn't the same. I think speaking to them, they knew me and maybe I was giving away something that I didn't personally wish to give away within my family. But when you're speaking to a stranger, well, a stranger at the beginning, it was different. They listened, now then, I never had this feeling that they were paying to listen to me. And as time went on, so many changes occurred within myself that money really didn't matter. It definitely, never came up as far as I was concerned. I could see the changes and I could see the benefits as far as I was concerned. So, no money was not, I don't think that, uh, a relative would have given me that. I would always had at the back of my mind somewhere, you listen to me because you have to listen to me. You know, you're my mom, you're my aunt or whatever. But, this man, is gonna tell me what I need to know or I need to hear and he's gonna help me to understand what I need to hear. 

00:27:20
EMMALINE MAXWELL Yeah, I think, well, my, my counsellor is almost like a umm… almost like holding a mirror for me. So like, so, you know, reflecting back so much. And it is, it's, you know, you're on a personal journey and so you, you go to counsellor to kind of find out about yourself and umm… I couldn't go to my parents to find out about myself because my parents think I'm somebody different. It's who I am. So, you know. 

00:27:45
BILL HAWKINS So they become, they become an extension of yourself really. Just, it's like, like having a whole other area of your brain which is completely untouched by, I don't know, yourself really or your own insecurities. And, unlike, like a family member or something, I don't know, knows, knows that, you know, knows, knows you and all that and you're kind of, your angles and, and I need you really, you know, and if they, I suppose they love you as well and that's, and that gets in the way of things because they'll be upset for you and you can't afford that, you can't afford that too much of that really, if you're truly listen to because it just, it become biased and stuff and start offering the wrong advice, you know it's not really about them. 

00:28:30
EMMALINE MAXWELL They got too much invested in you because they love you so much. 

00:28:35
Part 3: A Time and Space Just For Me 

00:28:40
MAUREEN MOORE So really important points have come up about the way in which you might or might not involve your families as, as if something, the some as your listeners and I wonder what's the difference between going and talking to a member of your family and umm… perhaps talking to a counsellor? What's the difference, why one and not the other? 

00:29:05
DIPTI SHAH I guess umm… when you're talking to a member of the family, you know, how confident umm… the inform is going to be kept is very difficult to understand. Umm… some, you know, with, with our family umm… we have an understanding that information needs to be shared regardless of who it belongs to. So umm… before you go out the door, it may, you know the rest of the family would know about it. And, whereas, with a counsellor umm… I can be really assured that whatever I say, will remain in the room and within the walls. 

00:29:50
MAUREEN MOORE Right. So confidentiality within the family is not the sort of confidentiality that you want? It's some strange, it's confidential within the family but. 

00:30:05
DIPTI SHAH Yeah, it's confidential within the family but there are some things which are confidential to the person or the relationship. Often, the issues about the relationship with someone else or maybe a relationship with myself, so umm… it's maybe, you know, uh, something that I don't want to share with other people in the family. 

00:30:30
MAUREEN MOORE You're nodding. 

00:30:30
DANIEL BARKER Yes, I think that struck it for me, there were certain things that, I thought my family thought I was a particular type of person and perhaps I shouldn't have some of the problems that I did have. And because of that, I, I also thought that if you tell your family everything about you that, they could be upset if they couldn't fix it, if they couldn't make it better. Again with my counsellor, I didn't have that. I knew that I could speak to them, I could expose my whole life and we could look at it in a reasonable way and there would be somebody there to help me. Not to give me advice because I think, I will go to my family if I wanted advice because they definitely want you to be better or they might not accept who you really are or what you really are and I know, for a fact that if I have spoken to one member of my family, they would say, no, you really don't think that way. You need to go away and think about it. You're, you're in that thinking right. So, it, it wouldn't have been even a chance to examine what was in there or anything else. No I didn't have any qualms about speaking to a stranger, as you say, but I would have thought quite long and hard about speaking to a relative and I was very, very close to my family but I would have thought long and hard about that. 

00:32:00
BILL HAWKINS Because you're talking to a therapist is not, like it's, so it is about umm… it's, it's the same it's almost like kind of extension of your own head really because you're talking to somebody who is, I say talking to a counsellor is not like talking to somebody outside of yourself. It's more like just creating more space inside of yourself, so you can, and so you share that brain space in a way, it's kind of enlarge yourself. Whereas, and so nothing ever really leaves you, whereas, as soon as you tell somebody who isn't a counsellor, who isn't a professional, trying to have an objectivity and who is a stranger then, you're, you're in, you're exposing yourself and you're, you are putting, putting limits on what you can explore, what you can study because, it's, it's, it's in the outside world rather than in the internal world which is, the world in which you and a counsellor share and that's, that's what makes it special because you're not, they're not external, they see they're simply become this extension of yourself and give you that room to look at it and you do need, it takes two brains to fix one really that's what I think, not fix but improve, you know, or look and analyze. 

00:33:05
MAUREEN MOORE Extend. 

00:33:05
BILL HAWKINS Yeah. 

00:33:10
EMMALINE MAXWELL Yeah, I think it is about the exploring you and just having that space to umm… kind of try things out in a way and, and really explore yourself in a way that, you know, I wouldn't really want to bother or worry a member of my family or, or best friend, you know, my best friends about having a good laugh with and, you know, things of that, yeah, hard times as well but umm… when you're getting into like really nitty gritty things that you want to share with a counsellor and then, yeah, definitely, the best place and you have the confidentiality things, you know. It helps you feel safe, it helps you feel safe. 

00:33:50
BILL HAWKINS And even if they did, even if they, even if some, even if the counsellor did happen to go crazy and tell somebody something, you still don't know them, you don't know their family, you don't know their friends, you're not connected to them. So, you know, even, even if it wasn't confidential, it was still work because, it's I'm disconnected from you, it's a huge kick you've got there. 

00:34:05
DANIEL BARKER You also see your family all the time, don't you? So you're expressing yourself continuously, once you make that statement, whatever statement it is to them is there. So as long as you are there, it's not the same as, speaking to your counsellor, talking it over, listen to what they said and them listening to you, going away and thinking about it in your own time. You're not there looking and thinking, oh gosh, what have I done now? What have I told them, I should have kept my mouth shut because they're gonna see you all the time. 

00:34:40
DIPTI SHAH Yes, I guess and also umm… not everybody is a good listener and knows how to contain what's being heard. Umm… you know, with my partner, he's a really good fixer in everything else. But talking to him about emotions is, usually, he has a solution and I don't often want a solution. I want to be heard. Umm… so I can find my own solution. So I think, I think that often doesn't work with a family. 

00:35:10
SHEENA SHAH Yeah, I think, it was, I was talking to someone who doesn't know people that you know. Umm… whereas, if you're talking to an Auntie or an uncle, they know people you might be talking about, if I had an argument with someone, I wanted to get out of my chest. If I was going to a counsellor who doesn't know the other person, it's sort of makes it easier to talk through things as well. 

00:35:35
MARY PRIEST—COBERN I found that on another side of that, that actually umm… our relationship with people are like friends or family and I found that relationship with the counsellor is really challenging because he could be my friend. Umm… and you know, when the time was up, the time was up, out the room kind of thing. So you had to actually work within this container and this time frame which was the professional way to work. And but it was a different type of relationship and I personally found that an adjustment but actually it was the safety of having that and that's why it works, is actually, it is within a container. But there was a part of me that actually got angry with that, you know, you're, you know, your answer, you know, you're giving me this space and you know umm… where is the two way into the relationship, you know. Because that is our conditioning and that is our expectation in relationship. So I was learning to be in a different type of relationship and umm… to yeah, I did learn how to do that but it was, you know, it was quite a challenge to realign and to be able to do that. 

00:36:55
MAUREEN MOORE It sounds like what, one of the things that makes the relation different, one of the things is the sort of boundaries that you have in the counseling relationship are very different from the boundaries that you have with a friendship and again different to the kind of boundaries that, that are within most families. And all of those boundaries are known to you and certainly in counselling, the boundaries are made clear as you say, when the time is up, you're out. And that is it. So in each area, you have a specific little kind of list of things that you can and can't do and, and are available to you. So those helps one of the things that makes the counselling, although, it's strict and very fairly precise, makes that relationship different. 

00:37:50
MARY PRIEST—COBERN Yes, because it's like a different type of laboratory almost, you know. It's a different setting, it's a different film set, it's got a different set of rules than we have in our family relationships and our friendship relationships and it's being able to accommodate and learn how to be in that relationship because it's different. And it's dealing with our conditioning and but we learn, but I learnt a lot of valuable stuff about my expectations and my way of interfacing in the world by actually going into that kind of laboratory which is you know, and it is scientific, how it works. I mean, it works with a, you know, with a heart relationship as well but it's, you know, and that, scientific or that, that way of working actually is, is part or was one of the valuable things to actually get a result. Otherwise, it's, you know. 

00:38:45
DIPTI SHAH I, I found that modeling is quite useful because I think having those really set boundaries help me to become more organized. Umm… and I was learning because my counsellor was modeling these behaviors, attitudes. It helped me to focus on my own organization umm… which really helped me to umm… sort myself out. 

00:39:20
MAUREEN MOORE So are you saying that this, the kind of boundaries and rules that are held within the counselling relationship somehow influence the way you manage the boundaries in the relationships outside of the counselling relationship. 

00:39:30
DIPTI SHAH Yes, initially, it was with myself umm… and you know, just to give you an example, I would be organized so that I had some idea of what I needed to work with when I went back again was when I first started counselling, I would just go and then be okay, I'll let the counsellor tell me what I need to know. But umm… as time went through, I started becoming organized. Oh, well, not perhaps, if something happen, oh I'll take that into my counselling session and see what, where I can take it. So, once I applied it to myself, then I could apply it to other areas in my life too. 

00:40:15
MARY PRIEST—COBERN I found it a discipline as well. Umm… you know, going and actually setting their time is set aside and you could just go and sit or you could go and bring something or you could pick up a thread from the last session which you kind of weave in and, and you know, kind of look at it a little bit closer with another eye because you've been kind of cooking it in your mind between those sessions, you know. And umm… it's rude doing that, it was actually valuable skill of reflection and also, it's okay to question, it's okay just to, to be in that space of, of, you know angst or that space of not knowing. It was okay not to know. It was okay just to be. And that was something very valuable that I learnt, you know, just, you know, just to be and the skill that, that you know, the discipline of going into that place and actually setting yourself aside that time to discover, to actually. 

00:41:25
DIPTI SHAH Yeah, and I think, one of the change, I found was that I started liking parts of myself that I perhaps didn't quite know or like prior to counselling. 

00:41:40
DANIEL BARKER I think, you know, talking about the relationship, and I was thinking about that. I think, it's not like any other relationship, I can think of. There is no one or not in my family in any case, that was willing to give me that undivided time. And no one who was willing to say, hey, what do you think about that, what's going on? I think, if you take that relationship and try and put it any place else, except where we put it within a counselling session, with these boundaries and I think, you need those things and when you have those things, you can expose yourself, you can explore, you can look. And I think within that relationship, that can be done. But it isn't within that relationship, if it's, as a friend, well, I don't know any friend who could give me that sort of time and listen, and ask me to explore what I've just said or done. But, if it's done and it's done well, because I've seen it done, then you can't be there, no you can't be there. 

00:42:45
BILL HAWKINS And ideally, you could, you could explore yourself to that extent on your own but it, you think, you just get lost and you get, you start, you get confused and you can't be certain about anything and you can't make decisions about, I mean, is it possible to explore your own, own, mind but you can't, you just have another, have in that space and, environment value to, to constantly to we kind of put, we kind of put, like climbing a mountain I suppose, if put those safety pins and then you move up and put another one in. Otherwise, you just, you just you you don't get… you don't get even any where because you keep, keep falling out. 

00:43:25
EMMALINE MAXWELL But I think after that, after the counselling sessions that I've had, I was also able to sort of continue that umm… awareness that I gained within that counselling sessions. So like, you know, I still have that kind of special sacred, uh, me time space to continue umm… really on my own umm… because it gave me so much strength for afterwards. 

00:43:55
Part 4: Reflections on the Counselling Process 

00:44:00
MAUREEN MOORE I'm really interested in this idea of, of continuing. Umm… you were speaking about continuing, having completed counselling but I'm think also of continuing the session in some way, processing the session and umm… and what you've talked about during the session, you're in the periods between meeting with your counsellor. 

00:44:25
EMMALINE MAXWELL Well, I think inevitably throughout the week umm… you'd, you'd notice situations or things that, you know, you talked about, the, the, you know, may set off triggers, you know, so you're, your awareness becomes more heightened in your everyday life and so you know, particular relationships whether it's about partner or, or member of the family, you know, whatever you've talked about or umm… or work. For example, you know, we've all got to carry on working and the counselling session is almost like pausing your life for a minute. So kind of outpour, you know, have an outpouring time sort of go through a few messy bits and, and then you know, go back to real life, well, you know, you've still got this stuff going on. But you can start applying the things that you're learning about. 

00:45:20
BILL HAWKINS And the skill, because it, you develop advanced skills and techniques for, I don't know, wish you can do, is know about, about sticking out for yourself in that or sticking up for other people or, you know, having, you know, sticking to what you truly believe and, what if there, I mean, everyone knows that every consellor from my… you know, make of that can help you thinking about these things but, you leave and then the serious situations coming about, you see these, usually through the people like, you know, it's usually, it's usually to people around you, you know, trying to do something, are getting something from you. But, you, you can see, you start to see it coming because you, beside you're aware of it because you've been talking about it. And so you can identify it quickly and you can, uh, you can act in a way which is almost is protecting you, you know in doing what's best for you. But not in a selfish way, just, it's about kind of self-respect. I think it's about discovering the nature of self-respect and that's to live a life of self-respect and I actually respect with other people. And that's one of the skills I remember mostly about. 

00:46:25
MAUREEN MOORE That's a really, really important point there sort of being able to respect yourself and umm… having that, that, the opportunity to, to increase that. 

00:46:40
BILL HAWKINS Yeah. 

00:46:40
MAUREEN MOORE You know at difficult and challenging times to think, to remind yourself that umm…. 

00:46:45
BILL HAWKINS When you truly, yeah. 

00:46:45
MAUREEN MOORE That you're valuable. 

00:46:45
BILL HAWKINS And when you, when you look at those weaknesses, you do come to respect yourself almost automatically because, you start to see the causes of them and why, why they keep occurring and, and you make the first step to change it. You suddenly respect yourself even more and then you reach a point where you won't let, you won't take advantage of it or a view of the world, you know. 

00:47:10
MARY PRIEST—COBERN So it's empowering and you… when you're finding your voice and actually having confidence in your voice is, you know, it's empowering and umm… it changes your life actually. 

00:47:20
BILL HAWKINS And you take, yeah, you take more risk as a result, you know. 

00:47:25
BILL HAWKINS Yeah. 

00:47:25
MAUREEN MOORE It's, it's quite interesting to, to think about that the other person, the person that you're talking to who is the counsellor being some what, who is very different to yourself and they might be different to you in all sorts of ways, you know, they, from the very obvious to the most subtle difference rather it's umm… you know, simply difference in heights, difference in gender, difference in culture, race, belief, you know, you could go on and on and on. Has that impacted on anyone here that the fact that you're working with someone that is just so different to yourself? 

00:48:05
DANIEL BARKER Well, I think, I learnt from, from that difference and now that you mentioned it, I think back on it and I think to myself, yes, you were different, you had something that said, one, you can do it, two, it's within you to move on, it's that empowerment that you were talking about. You had that respect that respect for yourself. So you have a different type of person, a person who actually can say something to you, who is genuine and then you go and you try it out and it works and it's successful and that seems to reinforce a little bit more for your belief. I'm not sure belief but the relationship that says, hey, you can help me to help myself, so you move forward again. So, yes, I think, if the person was the same as myself, then I wouldn't be sitting before him because we both have the same problem. So you have to be different from them, you have to be open and aware that something else exist. Yes, they have to be knowledgeable and experienced. I go along with that. But I don't want somebody who is the same as me. 

00:49:15
BILL HAWKINS In a way, I expected to have someone who is vastly different to, I think because then they stay, they can see through, they can see through, I mean, certain superficiality. The guy is always there, you know very straight laced, old guy, you know, but totally out of touch with the values. 

00:49:35
MAUREEN MOORE Watch it, watch it. 

00:49:40
BILL HAWKINS He can barely write an email, you know. But he could, I think, just about to manage writing an email. So explaining certain things to him is baffling but it kind of getting it through to him was good and so he see through the things like, what email, you could see through, and when it gets to, what was in the email for instance, so, you know, why was I sending it in the first place rather than what exactly it is on. Umm… why I listen to, because it does, I think if it's so much truly different, you kind of cut the, the kudos, whatever that, you know, cut through the rubbish and get to the. And also the, you get more objectivity as well because they see, if, if the, they being so different to them and that, it's difficult to explain but I think, in the same way, I could probably help him with a few things because, you know, I can second see where he's going wrong and I think he's getting caught up on that I don't get caught up because that's where we're different I suppose. 

00:50:35
MAUREEN MOORE It has been said that there are always two clients in the room. 

00:50:40
BILL HAWKINS Yeah, right, I think that's for us to shit, for sure. 

00:50:45
MAUREEN MOORE The counsellors are often asked, what did you learn from your client? 

00:50:50
MARY PRIEST—COBERN Oh, it's relationship, isn't it? And I heard that, you know, like here umm… like I had to speak to somebody that I felt could hear me. And therefore, I, when I found somebody to be a counsellor, I wanted somebody who kind of, could understand where I was coming from. And so I didn't want somebody that was like too different because like, you know, it would be like a different language and that would have been too much hard work. You know, when somebody that actually could share some of the values I share and umm… who could actually be a witness of me, you know, not just directing me but actually just hearing me. And watching me, you know. And you know respecting my story. Because it was, I was going with my story. And umm… I felt, like, you know, the gift was that I was heard. So, we're all different and that's actually. 

00:51:50
DIPTI SHAH It was umm… a gain for me too, I needed someone who was slightly different, so there was kind of umm… curiosity about them wanting to know what I was about but also somebody who could understand me. Not too different. But someone who did make assumptions about me. Didn't put me in box. And umm… relating and tell me what to do. Because they believed, I could do it. 

00:52:20
MARY PRIEST—COBERN Yeah. 

00:52:25
DIPTI SHAH Somebody who could help, help me to understand why I felt helpless and how I could gain my strength back or find a new strength. 

00:52:35
EMMALINE MAXWELL It is, it does give you kind of a discipline there, I think too umm… to actually relay your story to somebody who you haven't met before, who doesn't know any of you're history or anything. And uh… and that in itself helps you to start umm… picking all of the tangles that you've got yourself into. 

00:52:55
DIPTI SHAH That's kind of what you were saying about finding your voice. I think that was quite powerful for me. Because umm… being part of a large family, it's quite easy to get lost in that. Especially for someone who is caring for a lot of people. And to be able to giving that whole hour of just talking about myself and, and thinking about myself was just so empowering that when I came out of the session, I couldn't stop talking about myself. So umm… almost went the other end for a while, I didn't want to hear other people's problems or things. I wanted to tell, talk about me. 

00:53:40
MARY PRIEST—COBERN There is finding the balance in that too. I mean, I, I had first thought oh gosh, she's quite indulgent, you know, that I'm putting this time aside but then, of course, there was a reason for it. 

00:53:50
BILL HAWKINS That's less indulgent than going to a family, I suppose because you don't have to listen to. At least, at least when you come out, you've got the skills to listen to them better than they can listen to you. I think, that's. 

00:54:00
MARY PRIEST—COBERN Yeah, so you got more in your tool box when you come out of there, huh. 

00:54:05
BILL HAWKINS Yeah, I mean, that's right, I thought that, you know deal with that on my own, sort of professional and sort of pour on them and expect them to clean it up when I could really deal with their own problems and it was to help them and talk to them if they're not willing to do as the same as me. 

00:54:20
MAUREEN MOORE So, Daniel, you're talking about respecting yourself more. 

00:54:25
BILL HAWKINS Yeah. 

00:54:30
MAUREEN MOORE And, and, uh, that, that's a very umm… a very powerful outcome. 

00:54:35
BILL HAWKINS We're living a life of self-respect really. Not necessarily that being, self-respect being the key skill that you learn but rather than learning a set of skills that allow you to live a life of self-respect and respecting everyone else and acquiring it and giving it. 

00:54:55
MAUREEN MOORE All right. And somehow that, that connects with what umm… you had said earlier on about caring for yourself. You care for yourself umm… a lot more and, and you also want, you were then also happy to talk more about yourself whereas, you are perhaps quite restrained or restricted before. So, uh, I wonder if you could say more about the self care that facilitate it. 

00:55:20
DIPTI SHAH I kind of earned, I think, I've said, I've liked myself more. Umm… but that fits in quite closely with caring for myself because I think, I was so busy caring for everybody else that I was forgotten in that process. And, uh, through counselling, I learnt to like myself and care more for myself. Umm… and, and that kind of empowered me umm… and, and helped me to see myself as a really important person in relation to everybody else. Me coming first and then everybody else. 

00:56:00
MAUREEN MOORE Some people would call that selfish and, and they do get quite concerned. People do and sort of you say, you know, makes me feel quite selfish. So, how do we differentiate between caring for yourself and being selfish. 

00:56:10
EMMALINE MAXWELL I think, yeah, sorry, I think you have to umm… it's one thing that I learnt in counselling, you know, I needed to start caring about myself because umm… I needed to change my view of my life as well and, and that kind of what counselling helped me do, it helped me umm… look after myself and care for myself and love myself more. And that had an effect on all the other things that I did and all the other relationships that I had. 

00:56:40
BILL HAWKINS Because you can't truly care for anyone else, if you don't truly care for yourself. You can only ever care anyone as much as you care for, really care for yourself and if you think otherwise, you're just supposed to live that really, I think because umm… if you say you love somebody and umm… more than yourself then it's, it's not mutual and there is an imbalance there and I think, if you touch a little bit further, you'd probably see that, it wasn't through that but I think if you truly I could say, that you had a love for yourself and that to me is not like spoiling yourself or indulging yourself but just valuing who you are and what you have and, and who you know, have in your life and you can then, you can start to love them because you can't know it, until you know for yourself. 

00:57:30
SHEENA SHAH I think counselling for me umm… I learnt a lot about myself. Umm… and things that I thought I knew about myself weren't necessarily what I was actually like. Umm… as talking to a counsellor helped me learn things and things I learnt things I didn't like about myself as well as things that I liked about myself. But umm… in order to change those things, you have to know what they are, first. And which then helped me like myself better. 

00:58:00
MARY PRIEST—COBERN I think counselling has helped me to move forward in my life too and to actually tie up, you know, to actually bury my husband. I, I, you bury, you bury something, you know, you bury a person but you don't really, the relationship still goes on. So it was helping to have closure. I learnt that through actually being able to face it and face the situation and, and actually negotiate my way through and I couldn't have done it on my own. I couldn't have, I don't, I can't imagine how I could have done it without and that was actually caring for me, to actually give myself the time, the space, the witness to actually come to terms with very deep feelings that actually were umm… you know, challenging me in my life and helping me to actually be able to move forward. And actually it even empower one to actually, it's not what's society says it is or it has just, it's your own relationship with the past and with your future and you have a voice in that and it's okay. 

00:59:10
DIPTI SHAH They're talking about burying or I guess in my experience was about letting go. It meant letting go of people, who I now see as hang us on in my life. But at that point, I had thought were really important people who gave me a lot of attention because I was doing a lot for them. It was me other way around. But as I grew through counselling, I didn't need those people and it was umm… quite challenging as I often said, you're being selfish and you don't have time for us anymore and you don't care umm…. 

00:59:50
BILL HAWKINS There wouldn't be a right if you have a little bit more time for you. So it was mutual. 

00:59:55
DIPTI SHAH Yeah. But it wasn't, it was the other way. It was one way relationship. So 

01:00:00
BILL HAWKINS And it's difficult because you often liked them. You liked them to stay, you want to help them if that's what it takes to be friend with them but then it's not, it's not fair and it's not, and you know, you can't, truly respect yourself, if you're not, if that respect is not been met and it's not mutual, they're, you know, giving as much back in whatever way they can. Because it's, it's, immediately start to slip and, you are not doing a self-justice at that point. So you do have to let go of people you actually like sometimes. 

01:00:25
DIPTI SHAH And that's really hard and challenging because they kind of made up umm… a lot of things around me that were structures which I had to break in order to move on. 

01:00:35
BILL HAWKINS Yeah. 

01:00:35
DANIEL BARKER It's funny, because you're saying that but I never thought of the word care, care for myself. I thought to well, I want to know me a little bit better. I guess, it was that, I wanted to care for myself deep down inside. Well, I've never gone to counselling and so, well, I've just learned something just now. So therefore, yes, I must have learnt to care for myself a little bit more because I know myself more. 

01:01:05
BILL HAWKINS Yeah, you can't really, it's start to occur, when you start to know about, it starts to working out. 

01:01:10
MAUREEN MOORE Okay, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to stop. Thank you all very much for coming here today and for sharing your experiences of counselling, so openly and genuinely with us and with the audience. I have learnt a lot and I hope everybody has from each other. You've mentioned things that are factors that are very important in the counselling relationship like listening, honesty, confidentiality, being accepted as a person, being caring and helpful, not telling, not instructing, all of these things contribute to making the relationship what it is. Thank you very much for coming and, uh, it's been a very inspiring and umm… inspirational, absolutely inspirational discussion.
