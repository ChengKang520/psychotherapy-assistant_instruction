00:00:40
JAY HALEY The island of Bali is one of 13000 islands in Indonesia. Balinese have been invaded by modern civilization in the form of three million tourists who visit each year. 

00:01:00
[sil.] 

00:01:05
JAY HALEY While many cultures have been changed by tourism, the Balinese maintain the integrity of their art and culture despite the commercial invasion. They have little crime or juvenile delinquency. The lifecycle which rolls from birth to death ensure well being. One of the most elaborate is the cremation which ensures that the living has procured all obligations to the deceased and secondly the reincarnation of the birth of the soul. Balinese are captured(ph) with knowing that they could communicate with ancestors and receive their wisdom and protection. 

00:01:45
[sil.] 

00:02:00
JAY HALEY The unique nature of Bali is maintained by the Gods. The Gods are appreciated in many temples. 

00:02:10
[sil.] 

00:02:15
JAY HALEY There are more than 300,000 temples in Bali if one includes the family temples and there are constant festivals all year around. 

00:02:30
[sil.] 

00:02:40
JAY HALEY The villagers make offerings to the Gods in many forms including the dance. The children live in an atmosphere were offerings are carefully created and carried to the temples. When the Gods have accepted the essence of the offerings, the Balinese being a practical people take the offerings back home and dine upon. 

00:03:05
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY The family is so important in Bali. 

00:03:10
[sil.] 

00:03:15
JAY HALEY The Balinese household surrounded by a wall consists of several buildings. These are for sleeping, cooking, rice storage and temple shrines. Each pavilion has a strict special orientation facing the mountain or facing the sea. Male children continue to live in the compound while girls move in with their in-laws when they marry. 

00:03:45
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY In the closed living conditions, handling relatives and obligations can cause tensions. Explanations of witchcraft are often given. A healer will usually blame an ancestor, not the relative who lives next door and finds ways in which the ancestor insists on relatives not sharing a kitchen or something similar which increase tensions among female relative. They never name the guilty party causing the problem, because social contact with that person would be too difficult. The family reaffirms itself through ceremonies which take place daily. Haley was always amazed that Bali had a juvenile justice system but not detention center. 

00:04:30
Jay Haley, Ph.D 

00:04:30
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY Because family solve the problems on their own or with Balians. 

00:04:40
Sanskrit Texts on Palm Leaves 

00:04:50
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY This Balian treated a case which we followed of the 15-year-old farm laborer brought to a Balian because he was suffering from seizures for which physicians had found no physical cause. The Balian suggested that the boy Neomon(ph) and his family member live with the Balian's family so that he could observed the seizures. The family talked with the Balian who learned the Neomon's(ph) father had died and Neomon(ph) remained in the household of his father while his mother remarried and moved to the compound of her new husband's family which is customary. The Balian performed many rituals with the boy and family, he also refer them to a medium with whom he collaborated on cases. He wish to find out the cause of the problem. Possessed by the spirit of Neomon's(ph) dead grandfather, the mediums diagnosis was that the family had not performed the correct house ceremony after the father died. Therefore, the family had to make extensive preparations which required the entire family to attend including Neomon's(ph) mother. Relatives have a dialogue about the problems and when the mediums are skillful the issues are resolved by exploring them and coming to agreement. Haley interpreted this case in the same way interprets many problems, through bringing the family together, the problem could be resolved and the elaborate rituals could lead to interpersonal solutions. By moving in with the Balian the organization of the family was changed, the son is no longer stigmatized and blamed for the problem as it became a family issue which could be resolved in the proper ceremony. According to Haley what seems strange from individual dynamics such as the cause being black magic does not seem strange when seeing the interpersonal functions. 

00:07:05
JAY HALEY The whole family resolves stepfather issues, similarly in western family therapy, the whole family might be brought together to resolve the stepfather issues. 

00:07:15
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY In this family, two daughters were treated at the same time. The healer knows the cause as supernatural because the client produces tears. The girl's problem was diagnosed as an unhappy grandfather who was reincarnated in the girl causing her low blood pressure and sadness. The family participated in all aspects of the preparations and performance of the rituals. 

00:07:45
[sil.] 

00:08:00
JAY HALEY Families prepare hundreds of offerings or batam which are combinations of food, cash, flowers and rice. 

00:08:10
[sil.] 

00:08:15
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY The cure required the collaboration of a priest to perform the proper ceremony. Haley spent time questioning this healer about many aspects of his work. 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:40
Jay Haley is questioning the Balian on family violence 

00:08:45
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY To resolve marital conflict, he gives an amulet to the husband to make him more amorous. 

00:08:55
[sil.] 

00:09:00
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY One of the ways this Balian deals with aggression is filing down the canine teeth at puberty. This is an important life cycle ceremony celebrated by the whole family. This eradicates the animal nature of both women and men to assure that the adults are able to control their emotions, the major symptoms of madness which is symbolically controlled is aggression. 

00:09:25
JAY HALEY Ph.D I was on the Gregory Bateson research project from 1952 to the 1962. It was housed at the VA Hospital in Menlo Park, California. There we concentrated on madness and therapy, Bateson is often referred to as one of the fathers of family therapy. We went to Bali to observe the natural healing context of problems such as madness and how the Balinese family deals with them in their culture. 

00:10:00
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY There are thousands of Balians or healers of different kinds, these Balians are specialist in reading the ancient Sanskrit texts on the palm leaves which contain Balinese beliefs and practices. 

00:10:10
JAY HALEY Balians dispense advice, medicines, trance(ph) and instructions for offerings. Balian usually see clients in their own family compound. Clients are also accompanied by family members when they visit the Balian. The Balian prepare sacred objects on the shrine, which includes daily offerings of coconut rice and instance. This client is accompanied by her daughter. 

00:10:50
[sil.] 

00:11:00
JAY HALEY The Balian puts a Kris or small sword in water to diagnose the problem. He explains that it is caused by black magic. Clients may enter trance. 

00:11:20
[sil.] 

00:11:35
JAY HALEY Balian always prescribed medicine or a ritual to clients. 

00:11:45
[sil.] 

00:12:05
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY In this case, a girl had been treated by the healer for going crazy and had recovered, she now accompanied her friend for the therapy who was suffering from headaches and wanted to be beautiful. 

00:12:20
[sil.] 

00:12:35
JAY HALEY The Balian uses his incense for purification. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:50
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY The healer puts a Kris or small sword in the water to diagnose her problems. He explained it was black magic and put ginger root in her nose to expel tears, tears indicate supernatural causation. 

00:13:10
[sil.] 

00:13:20
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY She is expelling something as if she were expelling her problem. 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:50
JAY HALEY The healer takes an active role explaining what is to be done. Clients pay what they can. 

00:14:05
[non-English narration] 

00:14:10
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY Haley was discussing his idea of going crazy and how he handled the girl we just saw when she was originally brought to him by her parents. She ran out in the street shouting and without clothes. He had her live with his family for three days and cured her through ritual. 

00:14:35
JAY HALEY What is there about the girl who was crazy? The girl was shouting. 

00:14:45
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY Some of the other expressions for madness used by people are dizzy, confused, wondering and running amok. 

00:14:55
JAY HALEY Haley: Did he ask the parents to treat her in any special way? 

00:14:55
Balian: No 

00:15:00
JAY HALEY Did he explain to the family what he thought was wrong? 

00:15:00
Balian: No 

00:15:10
JAY HALEY Did he ask her to come back once more? 

00:15:10
Balian: Yes 

00:15:20
JAY HALEY In response to my question, if he refers any clients to hospital, the Balian said they he refer client to the hospital in Bangli and because it is not black magic. There is one mental hospital in Bali when we visited it had only 35 beds. One of the few reasons, the hospital has prison is for aggressive behavior. It is interesting to note however, that although the Balinese are an amiable people, they have a tradition that occasionally a citizen would run amok and kill people without anyone who is aware(ph). This would continue until the citizen was killed, nothing seem to stop this out of control suicidal behavior. Then someone proposed that the out of control person not be killed, but be arrested and imprisoned without being killed, this discouraged people from suicidal running amok to apparently avoid prison. In the United States such people would be considered insane when they have no awareness of having killed. In Bali running amok was not excused by accusations of insanity. 

00:16:35
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY This healers own problems originally were interpreted as divine or blessed madness caused by the Gods. He disappeared and wandered for six years and isolated himself in the mountains. Rather than giving him a debilitating diagnosis, this behavior may precede initiation as a healer, a valued person in Balinese society. Then he claims to have been buried for more than one month which this photo shows, this is not usual but the photos add to his powers, when his body was uncovered he was a Balian able to heal others. Hearing voices he began to try out sacred objects. He told us he now sees between 60 and 300 people a day for a few minutes each. Haley remarked jokingly he has just like the clinicians today who give medications. 

00:17:35
Gregory Bateson Bateson Project 1955 

00:17:35
JAY HALEY The theory most relevant to family therapy is system theory. This was introduced in the 1940s. The idea for therapy is that motivation is outside the person, what a person does is caused by what another person does. Ones thoughts and feelings are said to be in the hands of other people, this was a special interest of Gregory Bateson and he explored human relations from that view in his research project. 

00:18:05
New Guinea 1936 

00:18:05
JAY HALEY He wrote his book Naven in 36 which was about, it was very advanced for anthropology at that time. It was a… it was a tribe where the clans escalated and you know like an arms race and then they have a ceremony that brought them down so they can start over again and he was trying to describe that as an escalation and then… then the starting over in the systems where you didn't have the language for it and when we did came along with cybernetics then it made sense to debate and so he began to apply it needed within the psychiatry. 

00:18:35
1937 1951 

00:18:40
JAY HALEY When Bateson studied Bali with Margaret Mead in the 1930s, partly supported by a grant to study dementia praecox, they hypothesized that Balinese character was based on a particular sequence. The mother stimulated the child and when it responded she would ignore it. This idea was remarkably similar to the hypothesis Bateson proposed in the 1950s on his communication project. He suggested that schizophrenia was caused by a double bind which occurs when parents communicate conflicting levels of message to the child, such as the parents encouraging the child to respond and then objecting when he does. This was one of the few family hypothesis and it was clearly a way of thinking that Bateson had experienced for decades from Naven to Bali to Menlo park. 

00:19:35
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY They produced on rival visual materials 22,000 feet of 16 mm film 25000 photographs and seven finished films which to this day have not been surpassed an anthropology. We returned to the village where Bateson and Mead lived Bajoeng-Gedé to talk with some of the elders who knew them. It was difficult to imagine them spending three years to see the full cycle of ceremonies. 

00:20:05
JAY HALEY We learned that many of the people they studied in the 1930s now elders remained in the family compounds making institutional care unnecessary. And this village as enormously visited many of the lifecycle rituals from birth to death were changed little, providing a sense of security, independence and community collaboration. 

00:20:25
Made Kaler Assistant to Mead and Bateson in the 1930s 

00:20:25
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY Has the trance dancing become less today than it used to be? 

00:20:30
MADE KALER The trans dancing is still going on. I don't think is less and that was then long time ago. 

00:20:45
JAY HALEY Bateson sent John Weakland and myself to Arizona to discuss the relationship between nomadic trance and schizophrenia. The discussion was with the master of hypnosis Milton Erickson. Erickson was already familiar with Mead's and Bateson's work in the Bali. Milton Erickson once told me that the major differences between the two meaning the schizophrenic and hypnotic subject are illustrated by a patient walking up and down kicking himself. The schizophrenic really kicks himself, the hypnotic subject kicks himself in a less effective way. He can help himself while the schizophrenic cannot. I feel that the schizophrenic can help himself as much as the average citizen. It may sound irrational, but it is a metaphor for something rational. 

00:21:40
Voice of Milton H. Erickson, MD 

00:21:45
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY Mead brought the material to Erickson for analysis on trance which began a long friendship. Erickson discussed the Balinese trances with Haley and Weakland as analogous to hypnotic trances. These children are transformed by the trance into virgin nymphs semi Gods in Hindu mythology. They were influenced by his naturalistic non-pathological orientation to trance. Ritual trances in public ceremonies are valued and provide the opportunity to learn the control and skills of ritual possession trance. In the trance dancing ceremonies, these individuals express behaviors which would be seen as mad outside this context. One learns the movements from a very early age and had a change from spirit possession to the controlled and voluntary possession trance, which is both limited in time and space. 

00:22:50
JAY HALEY A major trance dance is the Kris dance when possessed by the Gods, men attack themselves with the sharp daggers, yet they are not hurt. Children observe these ceremonies at an early age, the Kris experience is part of an old tradition. It was filmed a half century ago by Mead and Bateson. 

00:23:20
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY There are other explanations for madness which may be handled in this ceremony, they include the witchment introduction of small creatures into the body, divine curses and inherited factors, one of the defining symptoms of madness is aggression which is so unusual in this culture outside the ritual context. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY Balian will tell someone with the problem to join a Barong group and dance. Many people with the illness are told to dance in the ceremony. Balian built the ceremonies to protect others against black magic. The religion of the Balinese is Hindu, the major gods are the Hindu trinity, Rama, the creator, Vishnu the caretaker and Siva the destroyer. There are many lesser gods as well as ancestors and demons. The children learn to appreciate a supernatural figure in Bali, the Barong resembling a Chinese dragon this creature protects the village from all evils. Another supernatural figure, is the powerful Rangda, the witch. She represents evil and must be guarded against. The Barong represents good and the witch represents evil. In life and in ceremonies, the Balinese attempt to balance these forces rather than try to get rid of evil. 

00:25:05
MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY Rituals of exorcism and purification are performed. Entire families attend these ceremonies together. Jay is questioning about amnesia. They say they feel tired but very well, sometimes they do not remember what happened. Like Erickson, Haley believes hypnotic and ritual trances are the same phenomena. He sees trance having the same sequence, a request for voluntary responses and men are request for involuntary ones. This is a paradox to direct someone to behave involuntarily. In the Balinese trances, a leader makes request for specific dances and then request that the they be possessed by the Gods as they dance an involuntary response as it is not them dancing but the Gods. 

00:26:05
JAY HALEY In summary, these are the similarities between strategic family therapy and Balinese therapy. Whether in public or private sessions, the family is brought together. Tasks or rituals are given. Balians and therapists are trained. They have specialties. They collaborate and refer to one another and to physicians. They give explanations for problems which are outside the individual. In strategic family therapy it is in the social context and Balinese therapy the explanations are in other worldly ways. And also there is an optimism that the client is curable.
