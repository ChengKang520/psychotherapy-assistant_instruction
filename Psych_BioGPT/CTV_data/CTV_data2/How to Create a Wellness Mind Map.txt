DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY I like using a mind map because it actually helps us to bypass our critical ah… mind, our critical way of thinking and our umm… maybe you have a way of dismissing things that you know are good for you, but you are just not willing to take that step. Well, creating a mind map can help you bypass all that critical thinking. So, I would encourage you to watch the next portion of this video and see a mind map in action and this one is a wellness mind map, and then, I challenge you to create one of your own.
