Microtraining Associates, Inc. www.emicrotraining.com (888)505-5576 Microtraining Associates Presents Life Review Series European-American Perspectives: Growing Up With Culture Allen E. Ivey Interviewed by John Littrell 

00:00:00
JOHN LITTRELL  Over the years, the Journal of Counseling and Development has had a series of interviews with prominent people in our profession who have contributed through their research, their writings, practice, and service. The interview today on September 25th 1997 is with Dr. Allen Ivey. In the course of this interview I hope to be able to have Allen explain, ah, for us and for future generations, the contributions that he has made, the ways in which he's gone about doing those contributions. So, as they get more of a sense of Allen Ivey as the person in additional, in addition to Allen Ivey as the professional. 

00:01:00
JOHN LITTRELL  Allen uhm, as I was reviewing for this interview, one of the things I noticed on your Web page it has a section that refers people to Cornwall in England. Your early years uhm, family of origin, what it was like growing up. 

00:01:20
ALLEN E. IVEY The first thing I have to say Cornwall is not in England, ah, ah, although the English would like to think so. Ah, I prefer to use the ah, word Kernow which is the, the native language. Also ah, talk about Greater Britain. (crosstalk) 

00:01:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:01:35
ALLEN E. IVEY But my father, my father's family ah, comes from Kernow ah, immigrated around the turn of the century. Ah, uhm, poverty and, and et cetera, and the, the whole family ah, came over to, to here... (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:01:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and to Canada and ah, struck out in a new directions, so ah, so one side is, ah, from basically ah, second generation. And went through the classic things that my dad trying to assimilate. It's not really not that too important to him where I go back and get involve in the roots. (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:02:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And actually I'm a, a member of Meybyon Kernow, which is the Nationalist party of Kernow. And, ah, have gone over there and done consciousness raising groups and various type of activities to support ah, those who would like to see, ah, what they call the evolution and more power... (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:02:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...for the Celtic people of Cornwall. (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:02:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, the other side is, ah, more classic example of Manifest Destiny. And, ah, and there's positive and negative consequences. My own reading is more of the negative ah, we can trace my mother side of the family back to 1631 and the ah, the, and the Lion arrived ah, here in New England. And, ah, family moved, I think it was some multiple families, but ah, the general pattern is, ah, ah, taking the land from native people in, ah, in, ah, Massachusetts. Taking the land from people in Albany and Hartford. (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Moving on to, ah, Adair county in Missouri. Ah, ah, taking again land from native peoples, and, ah, and that part is always the, the typical thing and it's part of family reason(ph) fought for the north, part of the family for, fought for the south. (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and then out to Washington state ah, town of Mount Vernon about 1885 thereabouts. I have on my wall the original ah, statement of the land grant from, from Ulysses S. Grant, signed by the President. They signed ah, land grants at that time. You know, as I get in the multi-cultural arena, again I said that Swinomish land... (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that our farm was on, that I love so much. This classic example of over the centuries of what we call in this country Manifest Destiny. 

00:04:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. And so reflected right there in your own background, many of those same issues that you're teaching about even today. 

00:04:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yes, ah, that really, it was the multicultural movement that finally got me looking at my own roots where I came from and how I got to be here. And that really kinda of, for some reason picked up a real interest in multicultural material basically in, even in about 1966, it's when I believe it really started. And, ah, some place along the line, probably in the 80's, I said, well, what about me? (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:04:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And I started retracing where I came from. And in that process I basically see myself as a White individual. Ah, you know, it was often, I was sometimes write about White privilege and I think I do benefit from White privilege. At the same time, I discovered I am, at least bicultural. Ah, the cultural message is it come from that Celtic people are, ah, more or less be where you are, education is not really that much of a value, and particularly don't put on airs. (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, that would be more or less the message I would get from that side of the family. And I remember going back to, to Cornwall and, and I think, why are you flitting all over the world doing these things? Why don't you just come home and be? (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And I think the concept of being within that culture ah, is really kind of central. And it kinda, kinda necessary for survival under, I would argue, centuries of English-Norman oppression. Ah, it still exists. Ah, an institu, institutional racism, prejudice, and so forth, I could go into lots of details now (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:05:49
JOHN LITTRELL So, there is the being in some ways part of your generation, and yet there is another, it seems like there is another aspect to... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Doing. 

00:05:55
JOHN LITTRELL ...doing. 

00:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, basically, ah, it's very American which we greet(ph) each other by how do you do, what, how are you doing? (crosstalk) 

00:06:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  We're getting constant little reinforcers in U.S. culture. You better be doing something to be worthwhile. It's not who you are in terms of being... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...it's what you do. Well, ah, my mother coming from this particular pattern and, ah, and, and her grandparents, both, ah, in different ways had relative wealth... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but lost it. And ah, so one of my lifetime tasks, I've been to figure out why is my mother pushing achievements so much and so forth. I began to realize that one of her targets for me, this is my interpretation, (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
ALLEN E. IVEY is to regain what the family lost... (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, in various depressions and, ah, family issues and so forth. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  And so the struggle between, inside me often is, I'm supposed to achieve but I am not supposed. And I, I'm, I'm more, as I look at my body now and so forth, I'm less of this back and forth. If you look at me 20 years ago, it would be off. It's always been... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...my basic motion would be working with double messages... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...from my family. Ah, and I'm beginning to realize now so much of those double messages. We're based in their, in their cultural experience. 

00:07:10
JOHN LITTRELL In fact, I think I do remember an early videotape that you were doing in which literally the body was, and moving back and forth. Uhm, at that point I thought I, I understood that more from a decision-making, but it sounds like there is also just this kind of a even at the core of who you are is... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:07:30
JOHN LITTRELL ...too real strange there. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, I don't know if it is really true or not, but I think one of my minor contributions, ah, to the field is in the confrontation say, at one hand this, and on the other hand that, but then that is kind of the way I grew up. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
JOHN LITTRELL (inaudible ) 

00:07:44
ALLEN E. IVEY On one hand this and the other hand that. And, ah, I recall really a lot... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...of confusion, mixed messages... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  and so forth as a child. 

00:07:50
JOHN LITTRELL But I'm also, you just mentioned this, is that's coming together more for you... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:07:55
JOHN LITTRELL ...now than it was even ten years ago. 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And I think part of it was really getting in touch with, ah, I went through periods of, ah, blaming the family and, you know, and the classic blame, blame the mother. (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And then you start to understand her history. Ah, both of my parents grew up in poverty, and I think maybe even extreme poverty. 

00:08:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:08:15
ALLEN E. IVEY My dad, ah, I really need to ask this, I think, I have always been afraid of it, actually he grew up with hunger. 

00:08:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And at one point his, after his father died, ah, my dad was about the age of 11, ah, oh, perhaps even younger. Ah, there was the, his, his mother almost put them in ah, in an orphanage. She just simply couldn't keep things together. (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
ALLEN E. IVEY She was taking in laundry and she was making her underwear out of flour sacks. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I mean, I mean real, real serious poverty. My mother ah, came from, ah, like I said, in a generation a lot of money but ah, my grandfather was a compulsive, ah, a gambling addict... (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, we call them now. And he went, he was the owner/editor of the paper in Wash, in a Mount Vernon, Washington, and ah, gambled it away at cards. (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And ended up being a Linotype operator. But the gambling addiction continued. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:09:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Sometimes my mother, my, my, my main recollection of my mother's stories is not having shoes for school, teachers getting after her because she didn't have, ah, the books she was supposed to have. (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY There was no money. And I really need to check out really the whole food imagine that. And that's a thing that I've pretty never quite were willing to explore. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I mean, next time I see my dad, (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm going to sort of find out if that was going on as well. 

00:09:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. Given that background, how did that influence you? 

00:09:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

00:09:45
JOHN LITTRELL What difference has that made in your life? 

00:09:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Well, I think that it, ah, ah, produces, you know, also keep in mind I was born in 1933 at the very bottom of the depression. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I am a real depression kid. And, ah, I basically was conditioned to, from a mentality of poverty rather than a mentality of abundance. (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And a lot of kids born at that particular time whose parents experienced the real severe difficult economic issues, like my dad lost his job two days before he was married and those are stories I grew up with. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY The stock market crashed, et cetera. And so you end up, ah, I think being a little more anxious about the world and a little less trusting than perhaps you should. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY On the other hand, I was the kinda my confident kids and I said, shouldn't you be a little more mistrustful? (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And I, I always wonder how to that I passed on to in different ways. So, it basically end up in, in that frame. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, to add to that, ah, ah, real critic, so you kinda start with that background. And If you were to do what I call a community genogram, you'd see my dad's ah, folks down just a quarter of a mile, and my dad has, had a small grocery store and a quarter of a mile down the other way ah, where's my mother's aunts and family. Ah, and the two farms joined. So, you see it's a very small tight world... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...with, ah, and that sense very family centered. But then very different families who really didn't have anything to do with each other, (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY they had different conceptions of themselves. (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm just Cornish. I can't do much. It's a very common thing, and the other one is, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
JOHN LITTRELL Go out in the world and do. 

00:11:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...well, and, we're English, and we're better than others. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I was actually literally getting those messages. At that point, I had the idea that the Cornish were English, and I got the same scrambled message and it puzzled me. (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, complicating things is I get to school, and my dad run a small grocery store in a rural area. And, ah, ah, all the other kids in the school, two rooms, ah, let say 25 kids ah, in, in the school. And, ah, all of the other kids were farmers. And I grew up basically with endless basis, epithets. And I was called virtually every anti-semitic, anti-Jewish name you could think of... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...by the kids. (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, and it was a more or less a day in and day out thing. So, and I didn't really, you know, understand. I don't know who, who Jewish people were. I never, never met one. Never really met a, a Jewish person until I went to college. (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and yet I was called this. And of course I immediately felt that affinity for Jewish kids... (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and, ah, I, I I've, I've shared this experience with some of my Jewish friends. And some of them experienced ah, similar type of thing like this, (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
ALLEN E. IVEY particularly if they were strong minority. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I felt, ah, day in and day out, pressure from that perspective. (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And well, the real tough thing is, John, was I knew where, even as a kid, I knew where these kids got it. I knew that was what was being said around the family dinner table about my parents. (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
ALLEN E. IVEY They talk about the grocery store, the owner exploiting the farmers, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:13:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, ah, so this people parents who are coming in the store. I'd be working at a kid in the store, I have to be nice to them. (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Small wonder I'm a little bit distant at times. (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And you should really learn that you've gotta, keep yourself, ah, gotta listen to what's going on. (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:35
ALLEN E. IVEY That's one of the reasons I get into listening skills. (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  And you kinda gotta watch what the other people are saying. (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, because, you see it's kinda tough to smile at people. And I did the classic thing that kids do is, that I never shared this with my folks, you know the, the, the ah, adult child... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...you know protecting the parents. But a lot of Jewish kids have done this to their folks, too. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And then internalized ah, some of that anger, (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY frustration directing at me rather than out like it... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...should have been. 

00:14:05
JOHN LITTRELL So, even early on experiencing in some ways prejudice even though it wasn't accurate. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:14:10
JOHN LITTRELL  At the same time still being on the receiving end of that. 

00:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, yeah, and that's kind of my, my basic model of growing up. (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and never really being able to, never really been able to trust... (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...which is, uhm, you know it's not really a, a great way to, to instruct the world. 

00:14:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. And yet uhm, when I've watched you working with people over the years in tapes and everything... (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
JOHN LITTRELL ...it seems like you have a tremendous trust in people's other, you know, at least in other people's ability to be able to work on issues... (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:14:50
JOHN LITTRELL ...to deal with those issues. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. That's... (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:14:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that's maybe we'll figure out exactly... (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...what's going out there in the process. 

00:15:00
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY But, ah, I, I actually, what I think it is, ah, and I think those that experience negative stuff, there's couple of ways that you can go. One is you continue to do the oppression yourself. You continue to scapegoat, ah, or may, or maybe it's a, a sublimation, ah, but or, is that I just still get really, really angry at people being mistreated unfairly. (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  And whether it's gays, lesbians, ah, people of color, (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
ALLEN E. IVEY or poor people, I mean, I just, it becomes a real... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...internal experience for me. I don't, I don't show it, (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY but it, I, I've been rage and sympathize inside. (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  And so, I really don't want to treat other people as I feel I was treated... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and I. (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
JOHN LITTRELL You mentioned even in the early, during the 60's, they're being aware and even starting to do some thinking, possibly writing about that. Is that, what was happening at that point that ah. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, yeah, at first pre-association crosses my mind. I was director of a counseling center at that point at the Colorado State University and, from '63 through '68. And, ah, along the way we discovered that ah, I don't, the CIA, but certainly a government agent that come in as a client into our center. And kinda got a sense of ah, the government's fear of change and... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...the whole movement in the '60s. This was very, in a very early stages of Vietnam and it was very clear long before the largest stuff came that the government was really out there... (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...looking at what's going on. I said, "Jeez, if they are visiting our counseling center. Ah, but I think historically is what the, the contextual issue for some reasons was always been important. And I really kinda have to go back from '60s to, ah, my first, I, I did a stint at Boston University while I was doing my doctorate. And, ah, I was totally insane. I finished my doctorate at Harvard in three years. I worked full time in the guidance office... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...at Boston University, two of those three years and still finished exactly... (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...on target of three years. But that's the ultimate, now as looking at it, it's gotta been ultimate in doing. Then at the age of 25, I went down and founded the counseling center at Bucknell University. And that's the, too young. No way. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY But that's what I was doing. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and, ah, I had a wonderful physician there. We got on very well and basically he was a mentor and so forth. But I also visited Don Ford ah, Bureau of Study Council over at Penn State. And, ah, that, and it has incredible staff, Hugh Irving(ph), Sam Osipow(ph) was one of the staff, (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:55
ALLEN E. IVEY psychologist at that point. Lots of wonderful people ah, were working there. And, ah, he had kinda started ah, what they call the Division of Study Council, I think. And was starting to outreach and I really admired his work. So, when I got to Colorado State, I really pushed the outreach... (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...dimension. Ah, with this wonderful staff we brought in. I'm not sure but I think, perhaps, at the, the Counseling Center at Colorado State was the first to bring in ah, ah, outreach into the, into married student housing. And I search... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...for person who had these expertise. And we, we're doing a variety of things like that. We went ah, did an outreach down into the, to Denver where we were helping a place psychiatric patients in the Denver economy. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:18:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, I remember coming out at proudly in 1965, I think ah, the counseling center of director's conference at Vail. And then Barbara Kirk, counseling director at ah, Cal and Clay Gerkin, counseling director at Iowa. Come with this anger and real attack on me. You should be sitting in your office seeing students one-to-one. And that's kinda have been the theme of my life. 

00:19:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Why aren't you sit in your office in the traditional way? See, what are you doing out in this community trying to be this activist? So it's kinda... (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...been there a long time. Now why, exactly, why I got interested community contacts so early puzzles me a little bit. For, Don Ford was clearly a model but then... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:19:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...why would I grab onto that rather than sitting in my office and focusing on the interview. (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Although, God knows, I spent plenty of my time sitting in my office, focusing on the details of the interview. (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I mean that's been the other center point of my career, these small details. 

00:19:40
JOHN LITTRELL So, you out in, activist in the community, and at the same time there is still you that sits and, while analyzing for long periods of time. 

00:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Long periods of time. I, I, I don't know. I doubt it. I don't think there's many people running around the world that looked as many inter, interviews in a smaller detail or classified as many interviews and as many different classifications... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...systems as I have. That's why I'm fascinated by the whole language process and that, the interaction that goes on... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  in the interview and the micro counseling stuff has really been very, very central to that. 

00:20:20
JOHN LITRRELL What brought you to that? How did micro counseling evolve, ah, what were the influences and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:20:25
JOHN LITRRELL ...that was clearly revolutionary in terms of the counseling profession to be able to have that? 

00:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  It's really, in one sense, real luck, ah, John. A couple of things came together. One was that was 1966 when we got our grant from the Kettering Foundation, bless their hearts. The Kettering Foundation, I'll say it again. Ah, and they, ah, were interested in the idea of identifying what are the specific single skills of counseling. Well, the Kettering Foundation had worked with Dwight Allen at Stanford in helping set up microteaching. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And I ah, went to school at Stanford with Dwight and Dwight helped us set up the grant. And we visited Stanford and the whole microteaching framework, ah, at Stanford and at the same time we also visited Bandura looking at the whole issue of social learning. (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And for us parenthetically a little bit of trivia at Bandura for the first course he ever taught after graduate school... (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
JOHN LITRRELL Hmm. 

00:21:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  ah, when he came to Stanford from Iowa. Ah, so those social learning routes become really, really important... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, from Dwight Allen and Bandura. Ah, and, and really in the whole process of discovery, ah, really begun out of it. The other thing was it, ah, television and home recording was just new. We have our I call the "boat anchor," these Ampex machines with these 1-inch tapes. (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, you could never go for more than 15 minutes, I swear, gosh, (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
JOHN LITRRELL Hmm. 

00:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY without calling the technician to fix them. So, ah, and in that time it was also a very cooperative endeavor ah, with ah, Cheryl Normington, ah, Dean Miller, ah, Max Uhlemann, ah, ah, Dick Haase, Gene Oetting, West Morrill, ah, I think those were the real central people... (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and I hope I haven't forgot some critical name, ah, Miller, Morrill, Haase and Ivey. (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I think I've got them all, Uhlemann and, ah, but we really worked on this whole project together... (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and, ah, I'd be hesitant to the discovery, so-called discovery of attending behavior was a very much a mutual ah, (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, process involving me, ah, our secretary, whom I credit a lot and, ah, ah, the whole team as we worked together to see what is going on in that session. 

00:22:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. And as you worked with that team, it sounded like you also spent large number of hours listening those tapes and so on... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, well. 

00:23:10
JOHN LITTRELL ...uhm, what was that like? 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, that project we began by the classic, looking at the literature. Ah, with, ah, Sny, W. U. Snyder done a lot of interview analysis. It's an interesting book. I would like to go back and look at again. (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, but it's gone now. Ah, in red in, we really weren't getting very far. We looked at videotapes and, ah, were nothing and again for six months in this project writing for our first report, we really hadn't identified a single skill. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:23:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  And finally I said, "Well, let's just try teaching it." And we brought our secretary and, ah, she was marvelous 'cause she sat there in the interview and she looked down, she topic jumped, ah, she broke in and started talking about herself, virtually anything that a person could do wrong in interview... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...bless her heart, she did. And so then I think it was West Morrill and I came in. They were really feeling good. I finally get something to work with. And I said, "Now, now what you need to do is, ah, look at your client, ah, lean forward a bit." And the whole business if, the whole specific behaviors, pretending behavior kinda generated right there... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...on the spot as West, West and I taught. And Carol went back and, ah, did this fantastic job of interviewing... (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...him, talk time was reduced, all that... (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...wonderful stuff. And ah, then, ah, we were elated and Dean, Dean Miller, ah, on the team and he came up with the word "attending behavior." (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, later on, Eugene Getting has helped put this in broader context. So, it was, and ah, Max Uhlemann was there and, and Dick Haase were there as graduate students really doing important contributions. (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So, it's very much a team type of effort. And then Carol came in the following Monday and said, "Allen, my life has changed. I went home and listened to my husband and he listened to me." And I said, "Hey, we've really got something here." It just kind of... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:25:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...grew from then on. Ah, it was, ah, ah, marvelous experience those days at Colorado State. It was really an exciting, intellectual and personal environment. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
ALLEN E. IVEY We could go on forever on that. 

00:25:15
JOHN LITTRELL What have been other intellectually exciting and challenging... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

00:25:20
JOHN LITTRELL ...things that you've been involved in over the years? 

00:25:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. Well, first one that crosses my mind, ah, which is really influential in my thinking is, ah, ah, University of Massachusetts. Ah, I got interest, I took three courses in a, ah, co, comparative literature along the pysch, French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And that was incredibly important for me to really reframe Freud, the psychodynamic counseling and the process of unconscious thought particularly as related to multi-cultural issues. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Lacanian thinking as I do not write much about it, but everything I say, I hardly go a day without thinking about Lacan and also a seminar on Hegel. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, that philosophical, very complex stuff was really there as backdrop. Ah, another critical dimension, ah, and I, I was, ah, coming here to UMass, again, ah, Dwight Allen was dean here. But, ah, teaching ah, the racism, ah, course, ah, we used to call it "Black and White in Helping" with, ah, Dean Norma Jean Anderson. And incredibly a valuable experience... (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and learning for me which really reformulated and started to help further contextualized learning. Although, interestingly enough, ah, I had a project on developing a behavioral objectives curriculum for training counselors in 1966 while at Colorado State and I picked as one of aid areas, ah, racial understanding in 1966. (crosstalk) 

00:27:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I guess that probably somehow I must've been influenced to that point by the, ah, Black Liberation Movement, Black Power Movement and the (inaudible ) what, what does counseling need to do to speak to these issues? (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So, as early as 1966, I started asking those questions. (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And, And that would, it would've been an all-White atmosphere. (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, it's kinda shocking to go back, John, and realize that, ah, I don't recall a single African-American in undergraduate school or graduate school, not one. Ah, I do not recall any, ah, Latino, Latinos. I do recall a very small group of Asian-Americans... (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...at Stanford. The English, ah, none at, none are Harvard. (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, ah, I didn't get a lot of contact... (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to do this. Ah, it's still kind of, I do remember at Stanford, ah, I was moving on campus my senior year and it was one of those defining moments that sort of enraged me. Ah, and, ah, my friends came to me and said, "Well, the only room we can locate for you is with this fellow" and he said you know, and he said, "He's Jewish, you know. Would that be okay for you?" It was like three, three or fours kids came to me to say did I mind rooming with, honestly, I mean, think it says a lot for the mentality of the times... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and I don't think those times have totally left. (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. In, I mean the real understanding on this is that, in some ways and it was made by word "scanning" sort of the environment through constantly... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm hmm. 

00:28:50
JOHN LITTRELL ...uhm, I'm almost getting a sense of what's the cutting edge, what, what are the things out there that somehow are gonna make sense that I can incorporate... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:29:00
JOHN LITTRELL ...was that? 

00:29:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. It's that, kind of, you know I've always kind of pushed the edge but... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...try not to get over the edge too much. (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, I think that's probably true and I puzzled about that and ah, I think it ties in with the interest on listening skills is one way to be safe personally... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...psychologically is anticipate trouble down the line. I seem to be incredibly skilled in getting myself in a controversy despite it's like an, it's kind of got that ah, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...at that dimension, ah, gets me in trouble sometimes. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY But in a lot of times that really is to say, "I need to know all to be, be safe." (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:29:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So, whether, whether it's individual interview or context or complex Lacanian thought or Freud... (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...or CBT, ah, or Viktor Frankl, I've, I've tried it. You know pretty much what each of these people... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...in saying and doing. 

00:29:55
JOHN LITTRELL  I'm almost hearing an immersion, sort of, if I'm getting in to an area, I immerse myself in that area or I get so involved that I somehow really... (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, yeah. 

00:30:05
JOHN LITTRELL ...understand kind of a, depth and breadth of that area. 

00:30:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. And, ah, there was, I started out, ah, I guess I would say a rabid Rogerian and very quickly I learned that a guy by the name of, ah, Thorne, ah, who said directive counseling was little more practical for working with vocational counseling, in, in colleges. And basically, that is all you had. You chose between directive counseling and nondirective counseling... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...when I began. And, ah, so I was there and I, then I got interested in this, in this, ah, this dimension. Picked up a little bit of the contextual stuff and then I became a thoroughly committed behaviorist along the way... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and tossed away all the other stuff. "Rogers is wrong"...(crosstalk) 

00:30:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and so forth and I was really into this stimulus response and all of that. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:30:55
ALLEN E. IVEY It was a useful phase. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And then my boss, Burns Crookston, who is really one of the great contributors to the student development area, ah, sent me out to, ah, Bethel, Maine, for an encounter group and I became an "encounter group freak"... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...for a, for a number of years. Even going out. (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
JOHN LITTRELL And this would have been when? 

00:31:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, it would have been in the, probably '66-'67 era... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:31:15
JOHN LITTRELL ...out, I'm out to Big Sur in Esalen, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...with, ah, with the Will Schultz and all of the "Joy" movements. Sending on attack groups I attended all of that kind of... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:31:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...stuff very early and immersed myself in that. But right along, and then along comes micro counseling, (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
ALLEN E. IVEY and I said to myself, "Hey, Allen, you've been into Rogers, you've been into, ah, Thorne and, and Williamson, ah, then you tossed that away and became a cognitive, but not a cognitive behaviorist, we didn't have cognitive... (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
JOHN LITTRELL Straight behaviorist. 

00:31:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...straight behaviorist didn't need this cognitive stuff. Cognition, I've never seen one of those. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:31:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I, I can't remember saying that to people. They don't exist. Not in cognition, just imagination. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:31:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And then, ah, also in that period getting into psychodynamic, I forgot to mention that. But then, in the encounter I said, "Hey, what's going on here?" At that point I said, "Well, they all have value... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  and, ah, rather than trying to find the right answer, I better start looking for some synthesis of understanding." (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And then so, that's, at that point I really kinda started moving slowly toward using micro skills to breakdown sequences and skills strategies... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and various types of theories. And kinda move to, ah, that's one of the things I wish that really had been, ah, probably should've done some researching, that's one of the great strength in micro counseling is breaking down skill strategies and CBT or some other framework so, so, people can learn, ah, not just the skills but also how to manage specific strategy. I do it pretty effective I think in my teaching... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but in terms of getting it out in the profession, it hasn't been too successful. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Can't do it all. 

00:32:50
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. What if, ah, you're the type that I'm not gonna be able to follow my notes here for, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
ALLEN E. IVEY No problem. 

00:33:00
JOHN LITTRELL  Ah, question if, when Allen Ivey is not an educator, a counselor, a psychologist and researcher, who is he? 

00:33:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Who is he? 

00:33:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. How is that for a broad, open-ended question? 

00:33:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Right. My, my immediate response is, ah, ah, lucky enough to be married to Mary Bradford Ivey. Ah, in which, choose, ah, that relationship is certainly been central and, wonderful and stabilizing and... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...centering, like I sometimes, (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...well, Mary makes me laugh. I'm not good, I'm not real great at laughing. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:33:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I wish I had your sense of humor. Ah, and, ah, the grandchildren are really, really special... (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and important. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
JOHN LITTRELL  In fact I remember seeing them on the website. 

00:33:50
ALLEN E. IVEY There are on the website. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
JOHN LITTRELL Yes. 

00:33:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I've got here one more, I gotta get on the website. Ah, and, ah, and, and, I suppose as I identify with all of those dimensions professionally I've talked about, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I really, ah, you know, I've been president of Division 17 APA and, and it sort of fits with the phases. I went to the first, ah, my first 15 years professionally, I made every ACA, ah, Convention and then suddenly I decided I wanna do APA and I did nothing with straight APA Conventions. (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And 'til I became president of Division 17. Then I got on APA Senate and I saw the horrendous politics as they split from, ah, APA, split with the American Psychological Society and, ah, the interpersonal stuff, (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
ALLEN E. IVEY real sad stuff that went on there, ah, ah, soured me on APA. Then I, then, I really moved to a primary commitment, currently to ACA. (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Although, ah, I still attend and try to stay alert within APA so... (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to move. 

00:35:00
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. Going back when you talked about your relation, you know, with Mary and said, "She makes me laugh." (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I know. 

00:35:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uhm, how, how has that changed you? 

00:35:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
JOHN LITTRELL How does enter in the kind of who you are? 

00:35:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  I think it, ah, it has moved me to ah, a little more time for being, a little more orientation to being, (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, although, Mary has her own set of achievement needs... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that's for sure but, ah, ah, more time for fun whether it's, ah, skiing and, ah, ah, when, when, when the old days, I would go out and do a lecture and come home, you know, it was about some place, another university. Now, I try to set it up so that, ah, she and I can go out and do it together and then... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...when we are there and we go out and celebrate and explore the area. So, we can have, ah, a nice time in that way. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  And whether it's skiing or, ah, walking or talking or endless discussion about professional issues, (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:36:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, she is really wonderful at, ah, forcing me to be clear. (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:36:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, ah, "What are you really saying? What do you really want to have happen?" (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, she's also taught me ah, how to apply concepts to children, ah, she's also has a wonderful contextual background, ah, in terms of not just doing individual but group and also larger system stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And we work together on a variety of multicultural projects as well. So, she is really been central and ah, I'm just delighted to have her as a friend, scholar, lover, ah, person just to be with. 

00:36:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. A little bit earlier, you've looted to being born right in the depths of the depression. And sometimes we could take a look at stages of our life... (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
JOHN LITTRELL ...and I was thinking about thus decades often get names, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:37:15
JOHN LITTRELL uhm, but if you were to go back and some ways take those stages and get them some names across your life, uhm, what would those stages be and what would be a word or phrase that, that sort to capture? 

00:37:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Like, you mean, how would I capture, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I've been thinking... (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
JOHN LITTRELL Well, for instance. (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Erikson's framework, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
JOHN LITTRELL Ah, thinking more in terms of your own personal, (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
JOHN LITTRELL professional, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
JOHN LITTRELL  across the decades perhaps or, (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. well, I'd take. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
JOHN LITTRELL divide it some of it whatever way would be appropriate here. 

00:37:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, I, I would basically, first focus on, ah, really, ah, ah, at pre-school period, which is very incredibly family-centered. And, ah, like I said, certainly mixed messages... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:38:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  were there, but it was wonderful that, I, I can, you know, still see my grandmother, ah, you know, singing her Methodist hymns as she was baking bread. I mean, it's a incredible image. (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Visiting my aunts' farm down the other way. And, ah, every, every time, going out, they still had horses when I was a kid, chewing out and being with them plowing the fields, (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:38:30
ALLEN E. IVEY which was really wonderful. Ah, so, and then, in school, it really I think that the theme is, ah, I guess the word that comes in mind is survival and alienation and feeling very much alone. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:38:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, finally, ah, moving out of that grade school and eighth grade because I finally got to the point in eighth grade that I was the only person in the class, and I mean they said enough already. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
ALLEN E. IVEY They sent me off to, to town and actually developed some friends that were really kinda fun... (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and really and kind of enjoyed high school. Ah, but coming from that closed environment, ah, it wa, it was tense but my mother pushed, pushed, pushed, whether to become an Eagle Scout, (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, go to the National Jamboree, take music lessons, ah, pushed me into a speech class, which is probably the smartest thing she ever did, ah, 'coz I, (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I was, I was, I was, I still am shy, but really could hardly speak at all... (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to people, ah, coming from that really very small, rural background. And that the speech class was totally marvelous. Ah, and then, from there, so, it would really be survival going to, ah, I think the time that, ah, Stanford and Harvard are blooming and, ah, well, the most, I've had an incredibly traumatic freshman year 'coz you come from, ah, I should mention also ah, Fundamentalist Baptist orientation where I held the idea that if a person drank one beer they would fall off the roof drunk. (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
ALLEN E. IVEY That's when I started college at Stanford as a freshman. Ah, and. (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
JOHN LITTRELL Which probably meant some adjustment. 

00:40:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  that's an adjustments and they picked the two best roommates to adjust to, for me to adjust to 'coz both of them flunked out in one quarter. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Both flunked all, my two roommates to flunked all courses. I mean that doesn't happen very often, (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:40:25
ALLEN E. IVEY even then. And so they were doing everything. That was really miserable, but I survived. And ah, you know, it was really, ah, Stanford was a wonderful intellectual experience. I had to go through, of course, the Fundamentalist Baptist Encounters Evolution, evolution wins, you know. (laughs) It's a little, little bit painful, but ah, the professors were really, really outstanding. (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And then ah, you know, Robert R. Sears, Hilgard, Sid Siegal, ah, nonparametric was a T.A. in my class. Baba Ram Das, Dick Alpert was a T.A. in, to Hilgard. I mean, the greats... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...were up and down the halls at Stanford and along to Harvard with ah, McClelland and ah, Kluckholn. It was incredible. Harvard was very difficult, but ah, incredible intellectual... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:41:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...experience. And a pleasure working with Dave Tiedeman. And then it really, it was kind of a Bucknell period where you kinda settled into the profession in Colorado State which was, ah, I think really the high point of my career working with Burns Crookston, setting up with, ah, with him and adding Morrill, Hurst, the first student development center. (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  To keep in mind... (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that out of that group it says you it something like four or five presidents of Division 17 plus Dick Suinn... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...came after me, who is now the current president of... (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...APA. So it's a program ah, really has not been noted enough. (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Why? Because they are not publishing in the journal accounts in site. I don't know why these counseling psychologist can't publish in some other journal... (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to become a good department but that's the way the Division 17 seems a lot to instruct too. (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And then UMass which really shifted the emphasis to multiculturalism and the Lacanian thought. (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, ah, the developmental therapy, of course, came out of that. One thing I've always done is, ah, try to take one or two courses a year and taking a course in Piaget with George Foreman, President of Piaget Society which is very formative. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, but I still try, try to learn also, learn from the students. Every time a student ask me... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...a question, I learn something new. (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY 'Coz, and, and I've now, ah, actually probably for the last 10 or 15 years, I've realized no matter what I talk about, there is somebody in that class that knows more about it than I do. Very humbling. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
ALLEN E. IVEY But that means I can listen to them. So, it's that scanning... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:42:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  again. Ah, and when students would ah, raise questions, rather than sitting there with my opinion, some students ah, ah, get very frustrated with this professor that changes his mind in front of them. Other people find this particularly ah, energizing... (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and, and, and respectful. But if you are the person who's got the answers, I am not the person you wanna listen to 'cause I might change my position tomorrow based on new data. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. Well, I saw that openness yesterday in the classroom, your willingness to explore and to look at new perspectives. Uhm. 

00:43:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I, I, I was sort of, I was thinking about it. My current, ah, new thing is, is poverty. And, ah, I have done the multicultural stuff, but this term for the very first time, I'm really trying to put a major emphasis on poverty as it... (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...interfaces with race and gender. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And I find that very exciting, and, ah, I say, "Why am I changing my course the last time I am teaching it?" (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I am getting ready... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to retire. Ridiculous. But it's, it's more fun that way. 

00:44:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. One of the issue or one of the topics with, well, with yesterday's class but, has been this issue of spirituality... (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
JOHN LITTRELL ...and I am wondering where, when that started to become prominent? And also, ah, what's happening for you that all of a sudden that somehow seemed to be something that you're exploring in much more depths? 

00:44:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, anyway, once a Baptist always a Baptist. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  And I think, I, I really argue that ah, the Southern Baptist Convention doesn't understand what being a Baptist is. Being a Baptist as Roger Williams who sat there in the middle of Plymouth Colony saids, "You guys at Plymouth Colony are crazy. I am gonna walk in the snow down to Rhode Island and think my own way." Clear hero... (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and how people can call themselves Baptist and try to impose their ideas on somebody else. You know, that, it, it infuriates me. (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So I have that tradition even though it's fundamentalists. (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So I came to salvation in my own hard way. I think maybe, that's why Baptists do that 'cause it's so difficult to come to salvation. They try to convince that there are other people, it's their way. (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, anyway, so that's our tradition and then of course, ah, I am clearly ah, from the eyes I think of most Baptist, a fallen Baptist. But, when I was in Harvard, ah, I did go to Baptist Church, continued. And ah, Sam Miller who later became Dean of Harvard Divinity School was the minister. So we're working at a very liberal tradition. Harvey Cox(ph) of Andover Newton, (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
ALLEN E. IVEY the famous... (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:45:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...liberal theologian, was in the faculty. We had people such as B. F. Skinner come to speak to our youth group. So, I learned a whole new, to me the real fundamental as, I'd say, "This is fundamental Baptism," it's a challenge choice and all kinds of things. So, that Baptist tradition is there, but is still, ah, not that interesting. And then, ah, I, ah, I remember leading a, yeah, when I became ah, in Colorado, ah, member of the, ah, I'm saying vesture(ph), not far away on the Baptist. But I remember one of the, the so-called leaders of the Church... (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...is teaching, teaching Sunday school and that was fine. I continue the same thing here in Amherst, Massachusetts, but the church was a little more fundamental. More in tune with the one I grew up with. (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, ah, couple of things happened. Ah, and it also says that, sometimes I ask for trouble, this and I, I was teaching a Sunday School class to high school students and one day, I bring in a, gay ah, ah, ah, a lesbian couple to talk about what lesbian, gay. This is in the early '70s. (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I still would, I'd still think of it but without any consultation of everybody else. (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:46:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And the whole church went into a big uproar over this, you know. The kids did fine and I did fine and, ah, and the lesbian couple was delighted that somebody in the church would listen to their story. (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
ALLEN E. IVEY But you know, I'm not, I think contextual, but it wasn't very contextual of me, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
ALLEN E. IVEY political of me. So that was one issue. The second issue was I was doing a line-by-line reading of the book of Mark. And I am a theory-practice person. If there's a... (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...theory how do you do it. And so we're doing a line-by-line reading and, ah, I'm doing it with the adult Sunday class. And I say, "Well, Christ gave away all his, all his money and if you're gonna follow me, you must be true to the poor." And it didn't bother me that they don't want to give away their funds. But the fact that this group of adults, fundamentalist adults, would not talk about the issue. (inaudible )relevant... (crosstalk) 

00:47:42
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:42
ALLEN E. IVEY ...while they're doing a literalist reading of the Bible. True, and that was really, where I really became a... (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...a truly fallen Baptist. I said, (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:50
ALLEN E. IVEY "If you're not gonna walk the talk," ah, and there was a nonverbal... (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to go with it. (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:47:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, so there's, there's that and they kinda left it, ah, and ah, and, and, it looked(ph) angry and so forth. And then along comes Mary, you know, and get, we were in second marriage and I see this person I value so much with her relationship to spirituality. (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And models (inaudible ) despite my negative attitudes and stereo... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and so forth. She finally won and so, she sure is a wonderful model... (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, and I'm, it's certainly nothing like her but listening more. (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, so that's kind of a personal stuff. The professional was couple of key things. One was, ah, I do a lot of live demonstrations when I go around. I also like to get positive images. You've done NLP, I've done... (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...NLP. I'd like to anchor these positive images in the body... (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:48:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to use these resources for the future. (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:48:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, I began to notice when I get these positive images about a third or half the time they were spiritual... (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...in nature. It's, hmm, interesting. (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Whether I was in Japan or Hong Kong or Australia, or doing a live demonstration... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...class, people without asking, would somehow take up... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...take on a spiritual image. So I had to read that. The other thing was the multicultural movement particularly the Native American issue epistemology. You see, here are the characters used for counseling native Americans where there's trees aloft(ph) and boy and so forth. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And then you gonna realize all of those dimensions are spiritual. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And my own argument ah, is if you're going to get into the multicultural area, we really must look at spiritual epistemologies. (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:49:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, and this has led me to the position, I say that all counseling is spiritual including Albert Ellis. Why Albert Ellis? Because he's working from individualistic Judeo-Christian tradition of the individual. And in saying, "And man shall have dominion." And we order things and we set up helpers to help ease therapists... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and clients. And Ellis is doing spiritual counseling even if he doesn't talk. But his heavily, he's working within the Judeo-Christian tradition. (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
ALLEN E. IVEY As, ah, Freud is certainly working in the Jewish tradition and it's important to acknowledge that major, perhaps maybe the major contribution been made by Jewish scholars... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and so forth in terms of helping professionals. And so, the spirituality in evidently place ourselves or even if they're fighting against it. George Kelly, they're working on the construct system. (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, the larger they work on the construct system ah, the Judeo, the Judeo-Christian has a lot to say. (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:50:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Of course, I get over the ah, the Japan and isn't it a, it's not a Judeo-Christian image, it's really a Shinto image. 

00:50:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:50:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, working in Japan, ah, ah, virtually every Japanese home has a Buddhist shrine. How can you work with the client who, that even he's go ahead and talk to whom, a lot of them wants to do this go and talk to the parents at the shrine without considering this important spiritual connection. 

00:51:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:51:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And then of course, we just plain have the data such as that from Herbert Benson at Harvard or the, the Gallup polls as 80 percent of people have a spiritual orientation, 10 percent of the people have had a profound encounter with the transcendent. I've not had a profound encounter transcendent. But let say if 10, 10 percent of people say they have and 80 percent on spiritual orientations, how can we leave this out to counseling movement? So, just plain professional logic says... (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:51:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, this is important. The third dimension is liberation theology... (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:51:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, and I'm very interested in Paul(ph) Frerris(ph) work. Ah, and it says it's a poorly(ph) Gustavo Gerres(ph) working in liberation theology applying. And the basic liberation theology is whacked attack, the things that I was talking about. Ah, in Mark, that's how you were going to live your religion in... (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:51:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...the present credible challenges. Ah, co-taught the spirituality course with Mary but also with Sister Rita Rabouin. Sister Rita is a cor, as a sisters of Notre Dame nun who was gone down and done liberation theology by going barefoot into the community. (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And really working with people to help them become aware... (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...of how their issues are caused by a natural cause, or let's say related to external contextual issues... (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  rather than, "It is my fault that I'm poor." Where is this soulful context... (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:52:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...which I'm poor. And so we are really back that issue in Mark of what about the poor? (crosstalk) 

00:52:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:52:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So we got kind of a synthesis going on in this term. And I'm thinking about my parents being poor, I'm thinking about Sister Rita working with the poor, I'm thinking about ah, liberation theology and I've had good fortune, ah, this summer for one of my Irish students to ah, from Dublin who gave me Angela's Ashes which... (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:52:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I could not recommend the book more firmly than describe the condition of poverty than this... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:52:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...wonderful book Angela's Ashes, described emotional conditions... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:52:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  this led me to really realize, we've got to look at the social class... (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:53:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and economics more in the counseling process. Which again may mean some more whack and attack in community action, (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:53:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Help. (laughs) 

00:53:05
JOHN LITTRELL Well, I was reminded as you were saying that you went back apparently, what was in the, I think in the '70s when you had the Sunday's or the class that looked at Mark and... (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. 

00:53:20
JOHN LITTRELL ...what you said about the poor and... (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:20
JOHN LITTRELL ...that the social activism from the '60s. It sounds like their, that theme continues... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:25
JOHN LITTRELL ...in a variety of different contexts but ah. (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. I was a very happy camper with, in the '60s, I was an angry camper... (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:53:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but I was happy camper. (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:53:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And then I, I love the students on the '60s; I love the attitude. I loved ah, and we really we're doing a phrase(ph) calls "popular education." I would raise an issue, the students raise an issue, and we started generating new ways of thinking about it... (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...together. And it's a wonderful nasty challenges from students. And they could attack me and I foolishly would listen to them. And for the most... (crosstalk) 

00:53:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:53:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...not always, but for the most part, we could come to an accommodation, particularly if I changed. 

00:53:55
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. Right. Yeah. You've mentioned down(ph) a number of people over the years and who's been the most influential person in your life? 

00:54:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

00:54:15
JOHN LITTRELL Or maybe we don't have to narrow down to one person, but. (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
ALLEN E. IVEY That ah, well, variety is at uhm, ah, ah, in the middle of that. I think about my dad and his courage, ah, he just, you know, ah, coming from such poverty... (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:54:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, and living through ah, near total deafness plus blindness... (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:54:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, ah, caring for my mother with the cancer resist(ph). He's kinda represents an impossible hero model for me. (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:54:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, very impressive. So he is clearly one. Uhm, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
JOHN LITTRELL  And how does that theme play itself out in your life? 

00:54:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, I think it leaves me striving because I think his model, ah, ah, and that so many ways, is more than I could do. Ah, ah, but you know it's... (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  it's nice and in that sense, again, I have to say my mother was ah, ah, quite wonderful, ah, and, and an inspiration multiculturally in terms of she was, ah, ah, had a, is, we're close to a Swinomish Nation, and, where we grew up about eight miles from the Swinomish Nation, and, ah, people from there would stop in, but a child, ah, a Swinomish child was named after my mother. (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:55:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And she, and my dad and she were invited to several powwow's... (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:55:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and given gifts and positions of honor and their relationship with the Swinomish, I think, was a clear model. (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  They're also, to the best of my knowledge, the first person to hire, ah, a Mexican-American to work in something other than the field. They hired him to work in, in the store with them. (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:56:00
ALLEN E. IVEY That was ah, as far as I can tell, that the first time they were sending Mexican-American who was just, it was kinda work in the fields. So that model... (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, was certainly there. Ah, not a perfect model by any means... (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:56:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but that was clearly there ah. (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
JOHN LITTRELL It also sounds like some early, in terms of cross-cultural, multicultural... (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
JOHN LITTRELL ...examples there. (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
ALLEN E. IVEY That is. Oh, yes. I think a real critical to mention was, ah, Tandy Wilbur, who was a manager of the Swinomish Nation. And he dressed up in a suit and tie, the only guy who came at the store that had a suit and tie. And he was about the only guy that I thought was really nice to me. And so, he really ended up being a hero for me as a, as a preschooler. It was just, you know, kinda like, "Isn't he special," (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:56:45
ALLEN E. IVEY and ah, that, that was ah, an important thing. And then his son, ah, was an activist and, ah, was killed in the Seattle airport in the bathroom. Ah, and I'm quite sure it had to do with the Bolt decision, and of course, as you know, Senator Slade Gorton, right now at Washington... (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...State, is still fighting Indian rights actively and Gorton was the one, that was one of the people who had imposing, but I'm not, not uhm, putting Gorton anything to do with with the murder... (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
JOHN LITTRELL Yes. 

00:57:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but the murder was during that whole controversy around Indian rights. (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:57:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So that I'm, ah, and, and, ah, was a small piece, small piece, small piece of trivia, I'm terrified when I go in the airport, airport or public, John, (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:57:25
ALLEN E. IVEY just terrified. Ah, another friend, Dan Jordan ah, of Baha'i was killed when he came into Kennedy and found stuffed in a garbage can. (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, so, ah, so Tandy Wilbur was clearly an early hero. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:57:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and, ah, and, ah, then ah, David Tiedeman, this wonderful model of scholarship. Ah, ah, Robert R. Sears, the tall president of APA ah, although, not too, not from my perspective, I'm not fully aware of context and other issues, but shortly a hero was an undergrad. 

00:58:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:58:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, E. F. Dowley at Stanford, ah. But, ah, Burns Crookston, ah, at, at the Dean of Colorado State University. Blooms(ph) is so large as a hero to me, (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:58:20
ALLEN E. IVEY and when he died early of a heart attack, I think we just lost one of our greatest people. (crosstalk) 

00:58:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:58:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And then ah, Norma Jean Anderson, Ernie Washington, ah, ah, particularly important 'coz I taught that, I've mentioned before I taught the multicultural course with, with ah, ah, Norma Jean and now with Ernie. (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
ALLEN E. IVEY They have been really, really important in my life. (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:58:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And Mary is a special hero. (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
JOHN LITTRELL Yes. Uh hmm. 

00:58:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, those were some people who really stand out. Paul Perch, ah, from Denmark. I did a Fulbright out of Stanford. And that was, that was really critical and contextual development issue, I should've thought of that, is that, ah, when I did my Fulbright, ah, I really learned, there was another culture, another way of thinking that came from individualistic thing working in, (crosstalk) 

00:59:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, socialist Denmark, seeing the high standard of liberate living, the absence of the poor, and, ah, the work they were doing contextually... (crosstalk) 

00:59:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...was magnificent in Denmark. And I think that really was the, the lever... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
JOHN LITTRELL And that would be... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I think that's finally the answer to... (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:59:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...delete this part and move it earlier. (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:59:30
ALLEN E. IVEY But Paul Perch, P-E-R-C-H, (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  is a model. He was major advisor to the social ministry... (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and ah, his conceptualization of, of what he held call back in early '60s, "The Psychological Educator"... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...is very similar to the (inaudible ), the contextual stuff I say now and, (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Perch's spirit, I would like to say that, lives in me in some extent. And Denmark is a very important place. (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm glad I remembered that. 

00:59:55
JOHN LITTRELL  Hmm. 

01:00:00
JOHN LITTRELL I think, we've someone is answered we've been, do you wanna take a break for a minute or. (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
ALLEN E. IVEY No, I'm fine. 

01:00:10
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

01:00:10
ALLEN E. IVEY We could go on for it. 

01:00:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uhm, you, you've been alluding to 'em, but ah, major milestones, events, or choice points ah, in your life that had led you in terms of what you've accomplished professionally... (crosstalk) 

01:00:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:00:20
JOHN LITTRELL ...and you've alluded to some, (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:00:25
JOHN LITTRELL but there are other things we haven't covered at this point? 

01:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I would say the, (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...moving is a general theme that has always been useful. And almost always, I think I have always liked moving. I could leave back the old stuff. I mean, I'll always recreate the problems where I go, (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
ALLEN E. IVEY but moving to a new setting has been, been wonderful. (crosstalk) 

01:00:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:00:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Although I did, I found ah, ah, leaving Colorado and Fort Collins, ah, still I find very painful, 'cause that was such a special place to me. (crosstalk) 

01:00:55
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:00:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And nothing has ever, nothing will ever match those years at CSU. (crosstalk) 

01:00:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:00:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, so a milestone was ah, getting these years(ph) in Stanford, Harvard, Denmark, CSU. It's a little, physical spaces, (crosstalk) 

01:01:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm hmm. 

01:01:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  international travel, ah, wonderful contacts we have in Japan, Hong Kong, Hawaii has really ah, been incredible. (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:01:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I don't wanna say locations and geography. (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

01:01:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And I get concerned about people in counseling, ah, they're just plain, don't have international culture, cross-cultural experience. Ah, Denmark may be very White but is a new set of cognition. It's a starts open a new way up, open your way of thinking. (crosstalk) 

01:01:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And, and so it's movement, ah, and space which have been most important for me... (crosstalk) 

01:01:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:01:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...in terms of change. 

01:01:40
JOHN LITTRELL  What is this, how did you find counseling, how did you come to that? (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, when I, when I was a sophomore at Stanford, I wanted to figure out what my major was. So, I went in to see a counselor. And he asked me what I wanna do. I said, "Well, I think I might like to be ah, have your job." And, totally discounted and I think I was supposed to be a journalism major. And it wasn't a disastrous experience... (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:02:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but it was interesting that, at that point. I should say, though, before I thought about counseling, I didn't know what counseling was... (crosstalk) 

01:02:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:02:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...because we didn't really have it in those days. But I thought what he did in the counseling center there at Stanford were quite pretty fun and pretty interesting. But I, I'm really a failed music major. I Started at Stanford as a music major. Didn't make it. (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:02:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Looked for something else. Had Ernest Hilgard's course with, you know, Baba Ram Das his wonderful T.A. (crosstalk) 

01:02:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:02:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I didn't actually have him but I saw him. (crosstalk) 

01:02:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:02:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, and I really thought Hilgard was really quite marvelous. Hilgard, by the way, was so open. I remember at that point, we didn't do meditation. And mind from the stuff is part of our treatment. But he was introducing us then into Eastern thought and it is in our doctorate psych course. (crosstalk) 

01:03:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:03:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And he said, there are these mysteries about meditation. And he just opened the door. And it's... (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:03:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...quite marvelous. Ah, and, ah, there's a big debate about law versus, ah, ah, ah, psychology. And somehow it seemed to be always counseling psychology rather than clinical, although I didn't know the difference. (crosstalk) 

01:03:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:03:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, it came time to go and I turned down a law scholarship to Stanford. And I look at that now and say, " Oh, well." You know, Diane Feinstein, a U.S. Senator... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:03:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...who was, was on the Executive Council at Stanford with me and a cheerleader, while I was, a pom-pom girl no, she was a cheerleader ah, while I was in the Stanford band. (crosstalk) 

01:03:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:03:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I said, "Hey, I could have been lawyer and ah, gotten rich. Darn." But I turned down ah, law school and ah, also very tempted and actually accepted the chance to work with Ralph Berdie and that whole wonderful group in Minnesota. And technically, that's where I really should have been except Stanford had an attitude toward, I mean, an attitude toward "dust bowl empiricisms." (crosstalk) 

01:04:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:04:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Always loved the, the Minnesota style, Minnesota people and those that worked in the Midwest. (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:04:10
ALLEN E. IVEY The Midwest, I've really never lived there. But Mary lived at Midwest, although. (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:04:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, so, that was ah, where, where what am I talking about? My choice points? 

01:04:20
JOHN LITTRELL Well, how you got into counseling? 

01:04:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, yeah well, and then it was ah, Denmark(ph) but it really was I loved the psychology courses. (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. As an undergraduate? (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I really did. As an undergraduate. I mean, I liked statistics. I even got over and I took it twice. And Sid Siegal was the T.A., Lawrence(ph) and the stat. And for a while I worked with ah, (inaudible ), you know, God, the greats. And ah, nice people. And the Psychology Department at Stanford was just so outstanding... (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and ah, academy of science is over then. It just, it just felt like home. (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I, I suspect, like everybody else ah, you're searching for yourself, is how I deal with this confusion. (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I think a lot of us go into counseling to find ourselves and... (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...this was made clear a few years later by Alice Miller's book, Drama of the Gifted Child. I think anybody that goes into counseling should read Alice Miller's Drama of the Gifted Child. (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So it really helps explains on how to meet our needs. And I was looking a way to sort out my cultural, family confusion... (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, in the counseling field. There's no doubt about that I was working on my issues. I wish more of us, I wish we did more to help students become aware that why are you becoming a counselor, what's your motivation? (crosstalk) 

01:05:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:05:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So, that's about the best I can do. (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:05:40
ALLEN E. IVEY There is ah, just, just good people and good education and predisposed, I guess. 

01:05:45
JOHN LITTRELL You used the phrase, I sometimes get into trouble or something of that nature... (crosstalk) 

01:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:50
JOHN LITTRELL ...Uhm, but what have been some of the crises in your career and how do you resolve those? 

01:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

01:06:00
[sil.] 

01:06:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Basically ah, John, I've been very lucky. You know, my crisis, have been, all been minor. Ah, I think, ah, ah, one was, I wish I had the knowledge to support was ah, working with a gay student. And, ah, and this was the point long before we saw and as I read 'cause I was part of that group. I saw a gay as an alternative way of living. And we were getting, doing counseling and, and made decision to bring in the parents to work with him in a positive approach. (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, and that was such a disaster, ah, bringing the parents in. I'm saying I wish that I could have been more helpful. I always felt badly that I wasn't, (crosstalk) 

01:06:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:06:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I could sit there in a lecture and say that I wasn't prepared and so forth. And how we're gonna handle parents that come in like that. But I would like to have been... (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...better prepared so that scene went better. That's one, ah. (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
JOHN LITTRELL  What was the time? 

01:07:05
ALLEN E. IVEY That would have been 19, ah, 1961, 62. 

01:07:10
JOHN LITTRELL Before that would have been even? 

01:07:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. (crosstalk) 

01:07:10
JOHN LITTRELL  Way before that? 

01:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Back in the days when I would do that. Back in the days when it's considered a pathology. (crosstalk) 

01:07:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  I go back so far ah, at, living history. And, ah, and that ah, when I took a summer job in the middle of graduate school as a social worker, they had gay kids locked up in Sedro Woolley State Mental Hospital trying to ... (crosstalk) 

01:07:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...cure them. I mean, the horrendous things in the history of psychology profession. 

01:07:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Shocking. Ah, so, that you know, in the sense, I, I, at that point I wish could helped more and known more... (crosstalk) 

01:07:55
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...you know, I, I certainly would be able to know. That would be one. At CSU, ah, there's kind of amusing crisis, so I was making a lots of things happen. And I remember this little turkey of an administrator saying, "You can't administer," 'coz I'm bringing in ah, literally over a million dollars worth of grants and ah, getting a nationally known staff. We're the first to, I believe, I'm quite confident we had the first so-called student development center in the nation doing a proactive police community outreach.(crosstalk) 

01:08:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:08:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  And he's saying I can't administer. But that actually is, is looking at and I, "Oh, that's why you're saying it because I'm a little short on the details. (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:08:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, didn't, it wasn't a crisis, (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:08:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  but it is a thing which will happen as I will get into too much and, and... (crosstalk) 

01:08:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:08:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...not have details. Ah, ah, so, you know, my crises are really pretty minor. (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:08:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  I mean there's a crisis of the divorce. Certainly, a major crisis. I would say that would be the major life crisis. (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And if, even if it doesn't, it's not counted as a trauma by DSM-IV, but hey, (inaudible ) critical issue. Flash backs, night sweats, you name it. (crosstalk) 

01:08:56
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:08:56
ALLEN E. IVEY  It's all there, the guilt ah, et cetera. It's, it's something that ah, you need not exist. That will be a life crisis. Ah, well, I think right now, I'm facing a life crisis as I've moved towards, this is my last term of teaching... (crosstalk) 

01:09:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:09:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and I find myself more stressed. I'm grabbing onto things, taking on more than I should. And I realize, and student, people are asking more than the usual. (crosstalk) 

01:09:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:09:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So, it's kind of like, ah, hanging on when you ought to be letting go. So, I've been lucky. I've been really lucky in terms of ah, crisis. I, I consider myself exceedingly fortunate. (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:09:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  I, I'd do the same thing... (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...again if I had to start over again. 

01:09:35
JOHN LITTRELL Well, Mary the other day (inaudible ) prepping me up referred to that, Allen's involved in teaching and writing presentations and micro counseling associates, and he's gonna retire from one of those. (inaudible ). 

01:09:52
ALLEN E. IVEY I'll have, I'm going from four jobs to three. (crosstalk) 

01:09:55
JOHN LITTRELL Yes. 

01:09:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I think I'll have enough to do. And I'm a little tired of the six to nine grind, (crosstalk) 

01:10:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY six in the morning till 9 at night. I'll miss the students. But 40 and a half years, I kind of know how to do it... (crosstalk) 

01:10:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:10:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I think. It's nice to be going out with better teaching readings than I had in the past. And, and still being able to change your course. 

01:10:20
JOHN LITTRELL Shifting gears for a minute. Uhm, lots of books, articles... (crosstalk) 

01:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:30
JOHN LITTRELL ...over the years, professional contributions, what do you consider your most outstanding contributions? Pretty most (inaudible ) that or... (crosstalk) 

01:10:38
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:10:38
JOHN LITTRELL  what may have been missed that you think has significant and meaningful for most... (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, in terms of missed ah, I was doing work at the VA in 1970s as a consultant ah, with in-patients. And ah, started to apply skills training to psychiatric patients. (crosstalk) 

01:11:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, that would be called "assertiveness training" now, but I was doing it with videotaping them, then identifying the skills and then role-play the skills... (crosstalk) 

01:11:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:11:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...until they've learned them. And I found out the course they were using a lot of the micro skills in the process, but we tailored it to their language. And we develop what we called a "Me Kit" where (inaudible ) these are the skills you've learned. (crosstalk) 

01:11:23
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:11:23
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, I was taking at that point we, they still had ah, people who had been in the hospital two or three years. I was taking people who had been in the hospital two or three years and coming in on a once or twice a week basis, getting people out of the hospital in four or five weeks. And it was really an incredible project. (crosstalk) 

01:11:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I made the mistake of not calling it assertiveness training. That would have been a wonderful thing if you called it. Ah, but the idea of teaching patient skills is enough to get them out of this, out of the hospital... (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  You don't need all this Lacanians, psychoanalytic, CBT stuff. All they need is skills. Ah, and I wish I think that that 70 article in ah, well, I called it "Media Therapy." (crosstalk) 

01:12:05
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:12:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, wrong title. Ah, it was, really that, in some ways it may be the best most comprehensive piece I used. And I go back and reinterpret that now theoretically in a variety of ways because we do skill training. 

01:12:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:12:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, we also did the sensorimotor level. Every time a patient came on the ward, we had patients running relaxation training teams and tapes. So we were doing body stuff, (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:12:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, we were doing some group reflection stuff as part of that. But the basic thing was skills. 

01:12:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:12:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And then it came a time to get out of the hospital, we were, ah, bringing the families in. And I began to see how the family was, was gonna leave through the rotating door. I wanted to start working with the family. The hospital didn't like that. I also began to realize, we, we (inaudible )in early Vietnam. That's before we had posttraumatic stress. And I say posttraumatic stress rather than posttraumatic stress disorder. (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, I wanted to encourage the veterans to get together and talk about their experiences. I wanted African Americans to get together and talk about their experiences. And I call that point "consciousness raising" groups. 

01:13:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hospital didn't like it. Closed down the project in the middle of data collection. Moved me to another ward. 

01:13:20
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:13:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, they didn't wanna change. 

01:13:20
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:13:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, and I think it was really a most exciting work I've ever done 'cause I was doing at that point clinically all the stuff I've been writing about ever since. 

01:13:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:13:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, included in that was as I argue and I'll say this, I still have a hard time just like Barbara Kirk and Clay Gerkin did in '63 and '64 in (inaudible ) Canada(ph) is that if you don't treat the social system, you're not treating the client. 

01:13:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:13:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And a therapists, administrators don't want that message. 

01:13:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Treat the client, help them fit the system. And if I was doing my great failure in life, it is just that that message ain't got out. 

01:14:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I have said it ah, for a long time. I practiced it for a long time. 

01:14:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And that message certainly get out. Gordon Paul(ph) does a wonderful work. And he focuses on skill training and so forth. No look at the system. Beck(ph) does wonderful work. End of story. No looking at the idea of how gender, racism, et cetera, (crosstalk) 

01:14:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY might affect the fact that, (crosstalk) 

01:14:25
JOHN LITTRELL All very clinical? 

01:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY all very clinical, a contextual. 

01:14:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, ah, so I'm trying again. Mary and I are doing an article on DSM-IV A Contextual Approach, (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...on how you can work with DSM IV. And again, I will argue it's unethical to treat a person for depression unless you consider contextual issues. 

01:14:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Don't treat a woman unless you consider how being a woman means to her, during having the depression. When a black, an African-American has hypertension, don't treat them for hypertension, relaxation unless your aware that racism raises blood pressure and some of the day of they're literally were clear... (crosstalk) 

01:15:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...on this, Contextual issues are there all time. People don't look at contextual issues. (crosstalk) 

01:15:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Contextual issues force you to think about walking the talk. (crosstalk) 

01:15:05
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And I'm not claiming I walk the talk. I talk about walking the talk more than I walk it. 

01:15:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. But to have a real key... (crosstalk) 

01:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:15:10
JOHN LITTRELL  experience back there not only just kind of its, what that theme of theory into practice... (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, no. 

01:15:20
JOHN LITTRELL ...in the middle, words about... (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:15:20
JOHN LITTRELL  hospital and so on and? 

01:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, it, it really, I realize now that I was doing it all then... (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:15:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and, ah, didn't have the words, concepts. 

01:15:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY That if, it was really powerful work when you take a person to the hospital three years and then are out in four or five weeks. Ah, and coupled with the fact, by the way, is that ah, the family doesn't want them out because they get more income. The family has more income but a lot of times was in the hospital. And we have this wonderful, wonderful conspiracy, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:15:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:15:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I think it still goes on, although I have not heard about it. Ah, and then what came out from the VA said, "Where patient population is down to 562. When we're below 600 ah, we can't get full funding. We're not gonna release any patients for the next month." 

01:16:10
JOHN LITTRELL Regardless to what happens to them. (crosstalk) 

01:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So, we're paying, regardless what happen to patients. We're paying patients to stay in, paying the patient's family to keep them in and paying us to keep them in. That's the way the mental house system works. 

01:16:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now, now, we're (inaudible ) paid not to treat them... (crosstalk) 

01:16:28
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. Yeah. 

01:16:28
ALLEN E. IVEY  under the management care. (crosstalk) 

01:16:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:16:30
ALLEN E. IVEY They're paid if you don't do anything. 

01:16:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:16:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So, it's, you know, it's kinda, say, say in a different name. 

01:16:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. Any additional ones that you would, in terms of your publications that you would say... (crosstalk) 

01:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Well. (crosstalk) 

01:16:40
JOHN LITTRELL  this represents the best that I have done. 

01:16:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, yeah, well, I think that's ah, I'm really, really proud of, of the Basic Attending Skills which is, (crosstalk) 

01:16:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:16:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  you know, translated into 13 or 14 languages and it's really exciting to see how micro counseling has done. We're just back from Japan. The Japanese Microcounseling Association. Our presentation in the morning was firmly translated and all that. But was really great news to hear that a nurse, a social worker, ah, a person of industry and the school counselor talk about the applications in Japan that they were making with the model. I mean, (crosstalk) 

01:17:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:17:15
ALLEN E. IVEY wow, how neat. 

01:17:20
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, he's somebody out there who's listening. 

01:17:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY That was very exciting. And then with them, that it's always possible there's something new. We've mentioned that we were with into spirituality, and what about the spiritual dimensions. (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And I'd say, 70 percent of the audience's questions dealt with spirituality. (crosstalk) 

01:17:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I'm very excited about doing with Mary and our translator Michiko Fukuhara(ph), ah, a piece on spirituality, counseling the Japanese situation. So, microcounseling. Ah, the other one which is I, I, I think, I think is vastly under, under pay attention to is Developmental Counseling and Therapy. We're thrilled that at least there are three or four textbooks now have it in. But, it is a wonderful integrated model. It's made, it made possible for me to do things with kids more broadly and conceptualize that I hadn't done before. 

01:18:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY But it all it does is provide words for, I think this important work I did. Ah, and I shouldn't say I, weren't for (inaudible ) and I were doing in the, ah, early '70s at the VA Hospital. 

01:18:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY But he provides names. And it's a system that really works the data and research on DCT were becoming awesome. (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and the question is at some point, but you need enough, lots of data before people start paying attention. 

01:18:35
JOHN LITTRELL  And as you, you referred to your scanning and, as you scan your current environment looking in terms of issues, what may be still on the back burner that's, you've mentioned about the poverty and so on, any additional ins(ph) out there that sort of intrigued you that, (crosstalk) 

01:19:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well. 

01:19:05
JOHN LITTRELL I may be, it's kind of like I may be spending more of my energies looking at that, exploring that? 

01:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, well, we will be certainly ah, doing more hopefully, more workshops on spirituality and counseling. 

01:19:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:19:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, I've been approached, perhaps, to do a book in the (inaudible ) spirituality and counseling. 

01:19:23
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:19:23
ALLEN E. IVEY  I'm excited about that possibility. Ah, Mary and I are really, we both, we do the spirituality work together of course. We're very hopeful about this, ah, new approach to DSM-IV. 

01:19:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, beyond that, ah, I think we will keep pushing the multicultural thing. And, ah, the spiritual thing is enough on the edge for me now because (inaudible ) play out. 

01:19:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I can't quite see beyond that. And ah, (crosstalk) 

01:19:50
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

01:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY let's see what happens. 

01:19:55
[sil.] 

01:19:55
JOHN LITTRELL  Well, looking at counseling as a profession and your involvement in that, uhm, you've alluded to a kind of several examples of both of ACA and APA over the years, uhm, your experience with the profession, uhm, what that relationship has been like for you, uhm, and in possibly talking here about also your professional service, uhm, in terms of being president and... (crosstalk) 

01:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY It's really... (crosstalk) 

01:20:30
JOHN LITTRELL ...in Division 17 and other things. 

01:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I kinda hit several points along the way. 

01:20:35
JOHN LITTRELL Yup. 

01:20:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I think that, ah, the, ah, presidency of Division 17 was ah, ah, well, I think, the highlight of that was, ah, appointed Derald Wing Sue to head up the ah, Professional Standards Committee and he came up with the multicultural competencies and finally, after almost 15 years, they've finally been approved via Division 7 exec, 17 Executive Committee, which was, (crosstalk) 

01:21:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY had always been a, a sore point in me, as to why they would approve this, that, and other thing, but why not these multicultural competencies... (crosstalk) 

01:21:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:21:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and finally, that's happening. Then actually, another thing I'm doing currently is a special assignment from Jerry Stone of Division 17, is looking at ways we can implement those multicultural competencies. So, that's, ah, having had a small part in the multicultural competencies, (crosstalk) 

01:21:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:21:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, was a really important thing. Ah, Paul Pedersen and I, when I was on APA Senate ah, worked toward inclusion of multicultural issues and the guidelines from mental health providers, guideline for, Guidelines for the Practice of Psychology and, ah, similar language in there, to involve in that, with George(ph), I'll be at the real confidence and the idea that counseling without knowledge of the culture difference is unethical. Ah, it was nice to me while up there... (crosstalk) 

01:22:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:22:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...professionally at the real(ph) conference, which ah, APA doesn't wanna look at. They'd rather, ah, professional practice model, the cultural frames is still uncomfortable for APA. (crosstalk) 

01:22:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:22:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I believe, I believe this despite a lot of verbiage to the contrary. Uhm, I have been certainly enjoyed ACA. I, ah, I just find it a very comfortable place to be and, ah, I think a lot of people with their head on straight, ah, I think there, there has a need to consider more multicultural issues, but I'd be delighted to work there. Uhm, uhm, it's, it's nice to have those professional homes. (crosstalk) 

01:22:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:22:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Best of all for me is North Atlantic Region of Aces, ah, which is small. I can go on, actually, I can go to a meeting and listen to somebody and learn and not... (crosstalk) 

01:22:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...be pulled in fifteen directions. So, I. 

01:22:55
JOHN LITTRELL  What are your thoughts in terms of where the counseling profession is going in terms of directions and also kinda current strengths, weaknesses or areas to work on? 

01:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And if you say counseling profession, to find as counselor at ACA, ah, the moment, ah, reading ah, counseling days, is not always a charge because, ah, the divisiveness with school counselors and, ah, mental health counselors talking about leaving, (crosstalk) 

01:23:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, the financial troubles are certainly leaves me with some real concerns. But then here I am. Leaving the profe, I'm, I'm, I'm so-called retiring and I, I don't wanna retire without these professional home. (crosstalk) 

01:23:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:23:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I, I hope it's still here, but I, I think it, I think it will be, I think it will be. Uhm, ah, in terms of direction, ah, I think what, I think what actually, what has happened, again, at NARACES, it was a wonderful feeling to hear, to see young people, at least younger than me, ah, assistant professors from various schools talking about multicultural work, cross-culture work, ah, from a very centered frame, very confident framing... (crosstalk) 

01:24:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:24:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and to see more people color or races, which when I began, was all male, (crosstalk) 

01:24:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:24:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  and now to see, ah, women and people color there. And these young people taking over, and they can say things about multicultural and set of studies which are, I hope are obviously important. But they say it, I'd say from a more centered and natural framework, which is why I kinda struggle at work, going like this, (crosstalk) 

01:24:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:24:35
ALLEN E. IVEY to get there. Ah, I hear them coming from more center and then I felt like seeing that, these young professionals come in with, I mean I guess the profession will survive. 

01:24:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:24:50
[sil.] 

01:24:50
JOHN LITTRELL  Major issues, uhm, obviously manage care is one of those things which is... (crosstalk) 

01:25:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm. 

01:25:00
JOHN LITTRELL ...making white water? 

01:25:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, very dangerous, very troublesome and ah, social workers ah, certainly coming in powerful position. (crosstalk) 

01:25:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:25:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  I'd certainly favor licensure counselors. I would like to see all school counselors going for licensures in mental health counseling. I hate to see their separation. Uhm, I think it managed care is gonna be, gonna be really an interesting issue, (crosstalk) 

01:25:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:25:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, but may happen on one scenario I've heard is that, ah, what people really want to do, counseling or therapy. They're gonna start paying for it again without their party payments. (crosstalk) 

01:25:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:25:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  And the third party payments, the third party is sort of slop, sloppy work done fast. And, ah, and talking to some people, it start getting a good reputation as a practitioner. They don't have to bother. You know, they aren't getting the six-deal(ph) $9800 an hour, so they don't have to go back. But there is just a very small window in private practitioners... (crosstalk) 

01:26:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:26:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...from counseling made big money, and so I think that window is probably closing, (crosstalk) 

01:26:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:26:10
ALLEN E. IVEY and it's gonna come to, ah, maybe also, with a better type of practice where people are gonna be free, ah, and a free market to choose what they wanna do, (crosstalk) 

01:26:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:26:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  and ah, some people wanna work for the, for the system and that's fine. (crosstalk) 

01:26:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:26:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  But at the moment, I'm not overly fond at what I see going on. 

01:26:25
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:26:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, I think what's gonna have to happen is mental health workers, social workers are gonna have to unionize. Ah, I think that consumers are gonna have to start getting active in challenging what is, I mean, that sounds heaven. Ah, I actually encouraged our union in our campus to set up an evaluation of how, sat, satisfied people are with the various type of manage care... (crosstalk) 

01:26:50
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:26:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and we're just collecting the data on that. Then hopefully, we'll find enough people that'll be satisfied, (crosstalk) 

01:26:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:26:55
ALLEN E. IVEY as a group we can go. But by myself, I can't do much. So I think, (crosstalk) 

01:27:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:27:00
ALLEN E. IVEY it's, it's gonna take consumer organization ah, and isn't just professional, (crosstalk) 

01:27:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:27:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  'cause this will have to leave dissatisfied people out there. 

01:27:05
JOHN LITTRELL Have you had a private practice, there's (inaudible )? (crosstalk) 

01:27:10
ALLEN E. IVEY No, I, (laughs) that would be one job too many, (crosstalk) 

01:27:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:27:15
ALLEN E. IVEY one job too many. So did ah, I did an immense amount of counseling, ah, I taught now, in Colorado State, and, ah, and really has been moved to, to live demonstrations (laugh) and oh, like Mary and I did a, occasional things such as we did a two-week stint ah, at the in-patient unit at, ah, University of New South Wales in Australia, some, some shorter things like that... (crosstalk) 

01:27:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:27:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...would come up, but, uhm, not enough time for private practice, we're kinda moving too much. 

01:27:40
JOHN LITTRELL Yup. You've referred to, with retirement and so on, ah, what are the challenges for you that you foresee in your future? 

01:27:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, number one is staying healthy, continuing to go to the gym... (crosstalk) 

01:28:00
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:28:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and, ah, and staying as healthy as I can. Ah, beyond that, ah, 

01:28:10
[sil.] 

01:28:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, for me, I, I guess, I actually, I don't see too much of a challenge 'coz I am pretty, still pretty work-centered, (crosstalk) 

01:28:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:28:20
ALLEN E. IVEY and I got a good sense of that when I was on, in Sabbatical in Honolulu. It's that, ah, ah, and I taught one course at the University of Hawaii, but, ah, reduce the work load to 40 hours a week from the 70 or 80, (crosstalk) 

01:28:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY and that's basically what I'd like to do, is ah, I'll structure my days, I'll write, ah, I'll read, I'll probably give more time for reading, (crosstalk) 

01:28:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:28:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  but I'll behave pretty much the same, and then we, I'll be a little more flexible for some interesting, ah, teaching workshop assignments overseas. Ah, particularly, I would, I wanna go back to, ah, South Australia and work with the, ah, ah, university people we know there, also with Dave Wrathman(ph) ah, and Matt Rigney(ph), who were aboriginal. Ah, David is the Chief Executive Officer of Aboriginal Affairs and Matthew is a, ah, social worker and ah, my learnings from aboriginal people have been really important because I really wanna go back and learn more and hopefully, I contribute a little along the way. 

01:29:20
JOHN LITTRELL  You mentioned about 60, 70 hours a week and so on, uhm, where does Allen get the energy? 

01:29:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, I. (crosstalk) 

01:29:30
JOHN LITTRELL  What keeps you going? 

01:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Actually, as I go back and look at it, I was, ah, not ADD but clearly a hyperactive child, and so I was kinda going itchy, (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:29:40
ALLEN E. IVEY always doing something, and ah, busy. And so it, it's, it's that dimension. 

01:29:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:29:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, although I envy those people that, ah, have longer days. I still need the eight, nine hours sleeping. (crosstalk) 

01:29:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:29:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm with the, the energy is, has been there and, ah, I get a lot of excitement about all the stuff I do, I'm, you know, just reflecting on it. (crosstalk) 

01:30:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

01:30:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  I get discouraged and frustrated at times but, ah, that's the way it goes, part of the pros, process. 

01:30:10
JOHN LITTRELL One of the, 

01:30:15
[sil.] 

01:30:15
JOHN LITTRELL (inaudible ) uses the miracle question... (crosstalk) 

01:30:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:30:20
JOHN LITTRELL  and if you were to wake up about tomorrow morning and a miracle happened in your life, what would be the first sign that that had occurred? 

01:30:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm, ah, the sun would be shining and would be warm. 

01:30:40
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah, okay. 

01:30:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, and ah, ah, well, I suppose a little more peacefulness, uhm, they'd be a little less driven, a little more centered. (crosstalk) 

01:30:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:30:55
ALLEN E. IVEY That would be, ah, ah, but the, the sun would be shining and, ah, the paper(ph) would be there and, ah, ah, I would do something perhaps for myself first, 'coz I, I do find I like myself better and take time for myself while working my hardest. Ah, maybe even get most productive. I'm not quite as fond with myself, so I need to... (crosstalk) 

01:31:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  allow myself to take more slow down for myself. 

01:31:25
JOHN LITTRELL  And you can live with(ph) to doing a little bit more of that, that, that it could be more of that? 

01:31:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yup. That would be the, the sign, that would be the sign of cure if I would, ah, probably do a little less. (crosstalk) 

01:31:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:31:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Less is more. 

01:31:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. What had often, you don't talk about giving advice to people, (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:31:50
JOHN LITTRELL but if you were to fallen to that category in terms of giving advice to counselors who are just beginning in the field. 

01:31:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:31:55
JOHN LITTRELL And also for those who have been in the field for a long time, (crosstalk) 

01:32:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:32:00
JOHN LITTRELL what would be the advice or caution or instruction? 

01:32:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Enjoy yourself, ah, be sensitive to difference, and, ah, never stop learning, 'coz it's the most fun of all. Don't be caught up in one particular mode of thinking... (crosstalk) 

01:32:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:32:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  re-invent yourself, and by the way it's been increasingly clear that's what the people have to do anyway, so I'm just saying do it. (laughing) 

01:32:30
JOHN LITTRELL (laughs) And so, how are you doing that for yourself? 

01:32:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, it's the fatherly thing ah, (crosstalk) 

01:32:35
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah, okay. 

01:32:35
ALLEN E. IVEY spirituality thing, ah, started the work at the gym, ah, last year, about the first time and like that, (crosstalk) 

01:32:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:32:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, so these are some ways that of ah, I was trying to find something new, (crosstalk) 

01:32:50
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

01:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY the new was critical. 

01:32:50
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. I, I hear that sort of theme, it's kinda like probably there are themes of, the, that you come out and with some new different ways. 

01:33:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:33:00
JOHN LITTRELL Ah, expanding on... (crosstalk) 

01:33:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:33:05
JOHN LITTRELL ...those over the years. 

01:33:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:33:05
JOHN LITTRELL  What do you think has been your greatest contribution to the field or another way of phrasing that would be, what would you most like to be remembered for? I'll change, change the tape before you. 

01:33:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. It include (inaudible ) 

01:33:29
JOHN LITTRELL  Yes, yes, we are. 

01:33:30
ALLEN E. IVEY 'Coz we have (inaudible ). 

01:33:35
[sil.] 

01:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, I'd like to be, what would I like to be remembered for? 

01:33:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:33:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, I guess what I often say, well he tried hard (laughs) ah, beyond that, ah, I think I would be for, ah, if you talk, if, if, if, if you go to professional publication, it would be the one that people have ignored, which I've mentioned a little earlier. (crosstalk) 

01:34:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh, okay. 

01:34:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, I think would be, ah, I guess that variation of, of the, the constant effort to buy something new. Ah, any particular professional contribution, ah, would be, ah, torn between micro-skills and developmental counseling therapy... (crosstalk) 

01:34:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:34:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, I think micro-skills, they may be more likely to be, I thought it's kinda, what, one of the wonderful things about that, John, is that, ah, words like attending behavior and et cetera, coming in the micro-skills. Ah, a pretty generic literature and not even associated with my name anymore, (crosstalk) 

01:34:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:34:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, or the name of the originators, and I sometimes get mixed feelings about that... (crosstalk) 

01:34:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:34:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but the basic feeling is the satisfaction. Hey, it's that nice to have had your language enter in... (crosstalk) 

01:35:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:35:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and ah, it, it's no big deal if I'm not remembered, if it's there, it's part of the process, ah, that's what really counts, rather would, than, than, than, than that. So, it's kind of the weaving in, ah, as part of a larger process... (crosstalk) 

01:35:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:35:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that, ah, well, I moved out the egocentricity that... (crosstalk) 

01:35:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:35:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...probably is more important to me. 

01:35:25
JOHN LITTRELL I was going back to your early theme, it's almost like moving from your achievement into simply the being... (crosstalk) 

01:35:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:35:30
JOHN LITTRELL  there. 

01:35:35
ALLEN E. IVEY There yeah. 

01:35:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:35:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Sometimes I get pretty angry when they don't cite about, say, ah, stuff that I say. Kinda, that was our word, that, that, that, that, that... (crosstalk) 

01:35:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:35:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and such as, such as your, and then I take a breath and say, "Huh, cool, no problem." 

01:35:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:35:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, there's, there's still a little mix-up when I say, John, that, (crosstalk) 

01:35:50
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:35:50
ALLEN E. IVEY that, that, the, the desires to say, "Hey, that's fine." 

01:35:50
JOHN LITTRELL  Yeah. As we bring this to a close, even as we've talked over in about the last hour and a half here, what have you heard yourself saying, 

01:36:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:36:00
JOHN LITTRELL  maybe that's, may have been in a slightly different way than what you've heard of before, ah, or I guess in some ways, re, having you reflect on... (crosstalk) 

01:36:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:36:15
JOHN LITTRELL ...what you've been saying in this interview here. 

01:36:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, I will, I will kind of, a couple things that I want is that ah, ah, if I think about the notion(ph) and the things that gull(ph) me and made me angry in the process. Like I'm a pretty pressured and I'm glad to be done with that. But I'm kind of impressed with, ah, ah, this I felt for me. I don't know if it showed or not, but it felt kind of a, a joyful, playful tone in some ways throughout, the fun of discovery, doing something different and... (crosstalk) 

01:36:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:36:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I suppose sometimes the fun of sort of mixing it up in certain situation, when people didn't want it mixed up, that's a kinda mischievous part, (crosstalk) 

01:36:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:36:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  but have fun. And then, ah, I guess coupled with that really is the, is the fun of working with, ah, with Mary. Ah, particularly it's been more, more peaceful but also more fun and time to sit back and enjoy it. So, (crosstalk) 

01:37:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:37:10
ALLEN E. IVEY it would be, that's what kinda stands out for me, which is, which is helpful to stage in my... (crosstalk) 

01:37:15
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:37:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...course as well, (crosstalk) 

01:37:15
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:37:15
ALLEN E. IVEY difficult, troublesome, this problem, and that problem and I'm glad to be done with that, (crosstalk) 

01:37:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:37:20
ALLEN E. IVEY but then, I guess I'm pretty lucky. 

01:37:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. And then, there's always the final oral exam question when we can't think of anything else to ask the student. We've already said... (crosstalk) 

01:37:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:37:35
JOHN LITTRELL ...what question should we have asked you here and, 

01:37:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

01:37:40
JOHN LITTRELL what have we, essentially, what have we not covered that's. 

01:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

01:37:50
[sil.] 

01:37:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, I suppose, ah, ah, I can't think of anything, maybe, 

01:38:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:38:00
ALLEN E. IVEY get them refreshed those stuff, 

01:38:00
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

01:38:00
ALLEN E. IVEY from all the different angles... (crosstalk) 

01:38:05
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:38:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that eventually, I think, we hear about everything I could imagine, maybe after off-camera. I think it's something that, ah, I think, really is, ah, ah, the intergenerational stuff from my immigrant grandfather ah, the, ah, ah, ah, my dad, center the whole family social structure in which I came and then, ah, seeing my kids and grandchildren moving on, doing their, their thing, in some very, (crosstalk) 

01:38:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:38:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  I think, some very positive encouraging ways, so it's a, kind of the intergenerational family theme of... (crosstalk) 

01:38:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:38:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...how we enact these issues. 'Coz I guess we're not talking about family therapy and family assistance, but that's been a influential piece on my thinking. 

01:39:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:39:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, seldom centered with kind of all those things(ph). 

01:39:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:39:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, as I, as Mary and I liked to say, individuals developing families in the cultural context and, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:39:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

01:39:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  I think we kinda covered... (crosstalk) 

01:39:15
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

01:39:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that theme, so, I don't think you've missed much. 

01:39:20
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. Well, we started there with family of origin and ending here even referring to your children, grandchildren. (crosstalk) 

01:39:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:39:25
JOHN LITTRELL  Thank you, thank you very much for your willingness to do this. 

01:39:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Thanks, John. I hope you could find something useful in the middle of all that. 

01:39:35
JOHN LITTRELL Well, I think there a lot useful in there. (crosstalk) 

01:39:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Sounds like, sounds like a lot of editing. (laughing) Thanks to you too, Bruce.
