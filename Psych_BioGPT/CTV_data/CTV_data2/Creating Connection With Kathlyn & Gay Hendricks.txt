Pat Love, Ed.D. 

00:00:45
JON CARLSON Welcome to the video series, "Living Love". 

00:00:50
PAT LOVE And today's segment, "Creating connection". Hi, I'm Pat Love. 

00:00:50
JON CARLSON And I'm Jon Carlson, this program, we have Doctors Kathlyn and Gay Hendricks with us. 

00:01:00
PAT LOVE I know, I'm so excited, you're going to love it because what they're going to do is really show us how to get energy from connection instead of have your relationship drain you of energy. 

00:01:10
JON CARLSON Oh for sure. We're going to do a lot of things here, today. We're gonna take a quiz. 

00:01:15
PAT LOVE Right, you're gonna get a chance to look at your own relationship under a microscope a little bit. 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON We're gonna listen to the Hendricks talking about connections and how to be better connected. 

00:01:20
PAT LOVE Exactly, we're gonna have real life couples with real issues practising these real skills that can make a difference. 

00:01:30
JON CARLSON So, then we can watch this at home and we can see just how to do it. 

00:01:30
PAT LOVE Exactly. I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to it. 

00:01:35
JON CARLSON You know, relationships today have changed so much. Couples today, talk about just being apart, just not being joined, they live parallel lives. 

00:01:40
PAT LOVE Exactly, and we know from research, that 80 percent of couples that split up don't split up because they don't love each other. It's because they have grown apart, wow, it's like a cold war that goes on oftentimes between two people. So, this series is really going to tell you how to prevent that. 

00:02:00
JON CARLSON You see, these are couples who say "I love you very much, I'm going to leave." 

00:02:05
PAT LOVE Actually, it often happens that way, in fact, 50 percent of divorces, the first sign that the problem is when one person says, "I'm outta here." Isn't that scary? But you look at what we've done in half a century, Jon. We've gone from six-, in the 60s, we had free love. In the 70s, we had open marriage. 

00:02:20
JON CARLSON I was there. 

00:02:20
PAT LOVE In the 80s, what we had was serial monogamy. In the 90s, we finally said, "OK, listen, in this ce-, next century, we want to be monogamous but we want it to be exciting, we want it to be alive. So this series is designed, this living love is to show you how to bring aliveness to your relationship. 

00:02:40
JON CARLSON And attachment, you're looking to get -.

PAT LOVE Number eight, last one: My partner feels appreciated by me. 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON Uhh. 

00:04:10
PAT LOVE That pretty much covers it, doesn't it? 

00:04:15
JON CARLSON Yeah, talks about connection in lots of ways. 

00:04:15
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:04:15
JON CARLSON Talks about being present, giving attention, having a commitment with one another, taking time together. 

00:04:25
PAT LOVE Exactly. 

00:04:25
JON CARLSON And feeling appreciated. 

00:04:25
PAT LOVE I just, I don't know about you but just reading these reminds me of what I need to be doing. 

00:04:30
JON CARLSON Oh boy, yeah, me too. It's kinda like I wanna get home and I wanna this, this is all possible, all doable. 

00:04:35
PAT LOVE Right, for it to work and get some energy from it. 

00:04:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. Well, why don't we, ah, in a minute, bring out our friends Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks. 

00:04:45
PAT LOVE Looking forward to it. 

00:04:45
JON CARLSON Today's couples have just so many demands on them, with children, with work, with friends, with trying to stay physically fit. Is it possible to have a relationship? 

00:05:00
GAY HENDRICKS I think, today, more than ever. It's necessary to have relationships and you have to work at it a little bit more perhaps because you don't have much time on your hands. We find that, in our relationship, we've been together about 20 years now and we're probably about 10, 20 times busier than when we first started and we have to work at it a little bit more to maintain the flow. 

00:05:20
Kathlyn Hendricks 

00:05:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Well, making the relationship as important or more important than the other things that we do in life. I think people tend to put the relationship last after all of those things and, and sometimes get more focused on the business of the relationship than the heart of the relationship and -. 

00:05:40
PAT LOVE Oh, it's interesting when you say work because I often feel like I have an aversion to work because I learned that work equals force times distance. But as I've seen your work, it doesn't look like force, it doesn't look like force over the distance, how would you say, how do you get people to work or whatever you want to call it on their relationship because it's so important and rewarding? 

00:06:00
GAY HENDRICKS Well, one thing you're saying is really important that you've got to make it not work. In other words, you've gotta make it, uh, play really because unless you're having a good time, nobody is going to work on themselves. 

00:06:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS In fact, in one of our books, Conscious Loving, we made one of the commitments that couples make to each other about having a good time. That, in your close relationship, it's possible to have a good time because many of us have learned growing up that relationships are hard work and compromise and you have to struggle and if you're not struggling, then there must be something wrong, you must be overlooking something. And we really think that relationships are the primary place where we can play and have fun and learn more about ourselves, moment to moment. 

00:06:40
PAT LOVE But that doesn't seem to happen a lot when I look around the couples. You can see people in restaurants and you think they must be married. 

00:06:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Right. (crosstalk) They're off in the distance. 

00:06:50
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) I think that doesn't look like fun. What is the resistance? The fun of having fun together? What's that about? 

00:06:50
GAY HENDRICKS Well, I think one thing is that, we have made a commitment to each other and we make our couples make a commitment to each other that has their relationship be the most important thing in their life. Because we invite people to put a priority on the flow of communication and if they won't do that, we don't work with them. 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON Are there different levels of communications in the case of relationships? It sounds like you're saying the closer, the better. 

00:07:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Well, the, a relationship involves both closeness and also being by yourself in your own relationship to the world within the context of your relationship so that if a relationship is really connected, if people really have a heart connection and a commitment. They can be distant from each other and doing different things in the world and bring that back to nourish the relationship rather than having those times apart, where we're each doing different things, be a source of distance. So, it just depends on if you're willing to make the relationship, really, the container for everything else that goes on in your life and once you've made that commitment, then everything can feed the relationship rather than leaking out from the relationship. 

00:08:05
PAT LOVE It almost sounds like the relationship is a source of energy as well as where you put your energy. 

00:08:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS That's a great way of putting it. 

00:08:15
GAY HENDRICKS That's a great way to put it, as a matter of fact, we believe that the power of commitment invokes a deeper source of energy than you get to without making a commitment. So, the moment I really got committed to our relationship, I felt myself shift into a whole different state of consciousness and the moment we quit struggling with each other as a power struggle and began looking out at the future together then we invoked a different type of energy. 

00:08:40
PAT LOVE Okay, I wanna know how you did that. I wanna know what you had to overcome (crosstalk) and what that was like. 

00:08:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS How long have we got here? 

00:08:45
JON CARLSON We got the seconds here. 

00:08:50
GAY HENDRICKS The two biggest things we do in our relationship is eliminate power struggles is one, we always tell the truth to each other like if I'm feeling angry, I say I'm angry, if I'm feeling sexually attracted to another woman, I say I felt some sexual attraction to this other person, I don't edit (crosstalk) anything with Kathy. 

00:09:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS (crosstalk) We don't edit with each other. It's just, it's just whatever we're experiencing, we do our best to not have any gap between what we're thinking or feeling and expressing it. 

00:09:20
PAT LOVE How did you all? Now how did you get there? 

00:09:20
GAY HENDRICKS We made a commitment to tell each other the truth within 10 seconds of noticing something and so we started working toward that, usually in the first early days, it was like three weeks before we would notice. 

00:09:30
PAT LOVE Right, right. 

00:09:30
GAY HENDRICKS I would say, oh yeah, I was feeling some attraction to that person at that party and I would tell her three weeks later, but as a result of that, we've had a very happy monogamous relationship for almost 20 years simply by telling each other the truth all the time. 

00:09:45
Kathlyn Hendricks 

00:09:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And the other thing I wanted to just say about is when we, when we felt when we told the truth, we sort of stumbled on it by accident. So when we told the truth to each other, we re-, we noticed that one, we felt more energy ourselves and two, we felt more connected. 

00:10:00
PAT LOVE Okay 

00:10:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, it wasn't, it wasn't like we told the truth to each other because it was a morally good thing to do. 

00:10:05
PAT LOVE Ohh. 

00:10:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It's because we noticed that we had more aliveness and more connection. 

00:10:10
PAT LOVE Okay, so how, you're going to tell us how you managed your anxiety of hearing, when you heard that, the first time, I wanna know how that went. 

00:10:15
GAY HENDRICKS And how you receive it. That's how we got so interested in breathing. I would try to breathe while she was saying, "I just wrecked your Saab." The other thing that I ought to really mention is that I've recommended to thousands of couples now, is that we call it Hendricks aeorobics. We say the only move you need to do to get exercise is to go from blaming the other person to saying, hmm, what's my contribution to this situation instead of it's your fault. It's, hmm, how did I create this situation? 

00:10:50
PAT LOVE But, but, I'm, I'm so invested in it being his fault at times, I mean, you know. I can get so invested in that, it really is just a momentary high. 

00:11:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It is, that's exactly what it is. 

00:11:00
PAT LOVE It's a momentary fix or something. 

00:11:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It's a , the addiction to adrenalin because when we blame, we actually get a burst of adrenalin and in that moment, there's that hee-hee-hee feeling that we call glee but it wears off very quickly and then you have to have another conflict or accelerate the drama in order to get your fix. 

00:11:20
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:11:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And that cycle, we sometimes call a wargasm because people have actually have that instead of having the intimacy (crosstalk) that they could have by being authentic. 

00:11:35
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) Right. And a, as you're saying that, I realize after the ha-ha, you know, after that, that momentary high, there is a letdown. 

00:11:40
GAY HENDRICKS Yes. 

00:11:40
PAT LOVE There is a depletion in energy so now that you're saying that,I'm realizing that that wargasm, I'm gonna remember that. I like that, I like that, that's a good reminder. So, managing my anxiety, telling the truth, having a commitment to tell the truth within 10 seconds. Y'all do this? 

00:11:55
GAY HENDRICKS That's the ideal. 

00:11:55
PAT LOVE Yes, I can see the energy between the two of you so something must be working. 

00:12:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Well, it, the other thing that we've noticed and that people who've known us for a long time have noticed is that we keep getting younger looking. So we can really say that the (crosstalk) - 

00:12:10
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) I'm gonna take notes. 

00:12:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It actually does work, people. I was looking at some of our pictures from ten years ago and we actually look younger now, and, uh, more, we have more physical energy and -. 

00:12:20
GAY HENDRICKS I lost 50 pounds. 

00:12:25
KATHLYN HENDRICKS You know, and I lost 30 and - . 

00:12:25
GAY HENDRICKS From eliminating the fat from here. I actually lost a lot of weight physically. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON Well, so many couples talk about being unappreciated by their partners, how do you keep that appreciation level up? 

00:12:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Well, that, that's such an issue for people because they're, uh, most of us I don't think have had much experience in seeing, uh, either our parents or peers appreciate, give and receive appreciation. 

00:12:55
JON CARLSON It's a thankless venture some people refer to. 

00:12:55
Gay Hendricks 

00:12:55
 It is and one big problem, Jon, is that I think people are not very good at appreciating themselves, for starters. So we, uh, we spend a lot of time thinking about how we might appreciate ourselves and how couples can appreciate themselves and also how to appreciate each other. But you know, it's a practiced skill, just like anything else. Everything important in relationships comes down to things that take 10 seconds or less. So it takes me less than 10 seconds to look at Kathlyn and say I really appreciate the way your hair looks today, it's very full and, uh, I like it. It's very full and casual-looking. 

00:13:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Oh, thank you. 

00:13:35
GAY HENDRICKS And I also love the colors that you're wearing between the black and the purple there. That's, uh, very pleasant to look at. 

00:13:40
PAT LOVE She's getting younger. Before my very eyes, it's happening. 

00:13:45
GAY HENDRICKS 10 seconds. And your voice, Pat, I love the vibrancy in your voice and so 10 seconds is all it takes and then it's just practicing it. 

00:13:55
PAT LOVE Let's see if I'm getting this because we started out talking about how in the busy workday life and the busy lives that we lead, it's hard to make room for a relationship. You're starting to form an image in my mind of the relationship being a real genuine source of energy. 

00:14:10
GAY HENDRICKS It is. 

00:14:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It is 

00:14:10
PAT LOVE I'm really getting to see that and I see that working between the two of you. 

00:14:15
Kathlyn Hendricks 

00:14:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It's a source of renewal and you notice it if you, if you just make these 10 second communications, it's not that you need to set aside a huge chunk of time to work on the relationship. That your commitment and these skills, you just interweave among all of the tasks and, and things that you need to do during the day and it makes a huge difference. 

00:14:35
PAT LOVE Well, also the fact that you see me and you were appreciating me. I felt energy and I saw you getting energy appreciating her. I mean, I'm just seeing this now in terms of energy. 

00:14:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS You're right. 

00:14:50
PAT LOVE And that's what we all want. 

00:14:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yeah, we all want more. We all want more energy. 

00:14:50
GAY HENDRICKS Exactly. 

00:14:50
PAT LOVE Where can I get more? 

00:14:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Because I have so much to do and so many demands on my time, where can I get more hours in the day, well, this is one way to do it because most couples waste their energy in the power struggle. We've seen that with thousands of couples, it's this, who's gonna be in charge and, uh, who's gonna be in control and when they stop doing that, there's all of this energy. 

00:15:10
PAT LOVE Okay, I want you to talk about one other energy drain because I can relate more to the Cold War. Not the push-pull, I (crosstalk), right, to where you just are very polite and you never argue and you go through life and then-. 

00:15:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And nothing ever -. 

00:15:30
PAT LOVE And the relationship dies on the vine. 

00:15:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Right, it withers. 

00:15:30
PAT LOVE That it dies for the lack of a second, I mean, it really does die because there is no energy in it and , and it's like the loneliest night you can ever spend. You can be lying next to someone you love, I mean, but you can't-, how do you reach out when you're, when you're worlds apart because this is why relationships break up not for lack of love but for lack of interest, for lack of energy. 

00:15:50
GAY HENDRICKS Uh huh, yes, and we find We've worked with about 3,000 couples now, what we've found is that it all boils down to somewhere back in the history of the relationship where they made a choice between either being authentic and saying something true about a feeling or a need or something or sweeping that under the rug. 

00:16:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Withholding. 

00:16:10
GAY HENDRICKS And it got swept under the rug and the moment, you withhold something, then you pull back from the relationship and you begin to project onto the other person. 

00:16:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS (crosstalk) The other person stops looking unsafe 

00:16:20
GAY HENDRICKS She's not safe to tell the truth to. So, if I swallow the truth, then she starts looking unsafe but where is the safety coming from? You know, it's my, my willingness to speak it, that's really what sources the safety. 

00:16:35
PAT LOVE Now you've gone to preaching and go into meddlin. Preaching the gospel, I think I'm a sweeper, I think I've swept things under the rug, I think I have. I never think of it that way but you do make a decision for the other person. 

00:16:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS You make a choice in that's-. 

00:16:50
PAT LOVE And that you pull back your energy. The energy piece really helps me. 

00:16:50
Kathlyn Hendricks 

00:16:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS But then on the other side, one thing that I think is really important for people to realize is that no matter how many years they've been in this withholding pattern. That the moment, that either one makes the decision to be authentic, the relationship is renewed. So you can and we've seen that miracle happen in lots of relationships that, where they've been in a power struggle for sometimes decades and the moment where someone says you know, I was really angry when you went over and talked to Jane at the party and I never said anything to you about it. Boom. (crosstalk) They're back. 

00:17:25
GAY HENDRICKS (crosstalk)It comes back again. 

00:17:25
KATHLYN HENDRICKS They're connected again. 

00:17:30
PAT LOVE I've got one question there, what if I do this and my partner doesn't? 

00:17:30
GAY HENDRICKS That's the way it is. 

00:17:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS That's -. 

00:17:35
GAY HENDRICKS In other words, 

00:17:35
PAT LOVE Well thanks, you're right. Gee. 

00:17:40
Gay Hendricks 

00:17:40
GAY HENDRICKS In other words, it always starts with one person if you wait for the other person to make a move, that can sometimes take decades. And so, what has to happen is one person needs to get out into the game first and wake up first. 

00:17:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Be willing. 

00:17:55
GAY HENDRICKS Be willing, and then, that starts a chain of aliveness. 

00:18:00
JON CARLSON I'm just thinking how great you feel when someone appreciates you, just how much that-. 

00:18:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Oh yeah. 

00:18:05
JON CARLSON You know, how good your partner's gonna feel when they're appreciated by you. It's that sharing. 10 seconds, too. 

00:18:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS 10 seconds. 

00:18:10
PAT LOVE Wow.I'm just curious. Okay, if you were gonna, if I were gonna start today, wanted to take one small step. Where would be a place to start within your understanding, and your knowledge? I mean, would I start with telling the truth, you know, the ten seconds thing or would I start with the appreciation? I mean, do you have an idea, does it differ for different people? 

00:18:30
GAY HENDRICKS One thing I would start with is commitment. Ask yourself a very simple question, am I really committed to feeling complete intimacy with myself and with other people. And if you can get a strong yes or a no to that. I mean it's okay to have a no to that right now in your life if that's where you are. But if you can get a strong yes, that yes, I'm committed to a flow of energy with this person and within myself, that's a great place to start. 

00:18:55
PAT LOVE Okay, one more question because I tend to be a distancer. So I get scared when I hear the word intimacy. Because I think that means like, need to need, joined at the hip. 

00:19:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Never do anything - yeah. 

00:19:10
JON CARLSON Can you give me something to work with, I'm a little scared at the, that thought. 

00:19:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So intimacy, what we call the relationship dance, closeness and separateness, that a relationship that's really thriving, people know how to be close and they also know how to be separate within the container of the relationship. 

00:19:30
JON CARLSON Feel comfortable both places. 

00:19:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS You feel comfortable both places, we have a prejudice within our training, I believe in this culture, that intimacy means joined at the hip and so that would mean if Gay wanted to do something with his friends that he didn't love me. 

00:19:45
PAT LOVE Yeah, true. 

00:19:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Or there's something wrong with the relationship or there's something wrong with him. 

00:19:50
PAT LOVE And see, I feel so loved, for example, when we're both working around the house, in different parts of the house, and one's outside and one's inside. Or that when I've been out of my friends and I come home and I get this wonderful greeting, I mean that's, it feels so secure to know I can go and come back. 

00:20:05
GAY HENDRICKS Yes, and one of my clients, a while back, bought in a little paper and I don't know who wrote this but they said the definition of intimacy is "into me I see". In other words, the idea of being transparent to ourselves first and then letting other people be transparent to us. "Into you, I see" and "Into me, I see". 

00:20:25
JON CARLSON Well, now, what we're gonna do, you ask where to start, I think the place to start is to move on to having you show our studio audience just how to be present with one another, so why don't we move on.

KATHLYN HENDRICKS We'd love to do that. 

00:20:40
PAT LOVE Looking forward to it. 

00:20:45
[music] 

00:20:45
JON CARLSON Well, this is a part that I've been waiting for, ah, to get a chance to actually watch Gay and Kathlyn work with our studio audience. They're eager, they're excited, uh, why don't, Pat, why don't you and I get out of the way and let them work? 

00:21:05
PAT LOVE Right, yes. 

00:21:05
GAY HENDRICKS Thanks a lot. 

00:21:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Thank you. We wanted to start, um, our activities section with you by talking a little bit about one of the elements of relationship that most people overlook and that's how to be with each other. I know probably when you fell in love with each other that one of the elements of that is that, the, what we noticed in our relationship about being able to be with each other without doing anything. You know, it's feeling comfortable with your partner, like one of the things we really enjoy in our relationship is sitting in bed together and both of us are reading, and we're not talking to each other but there's that element of being present with each other. And that was one of the things that we wanted to focus on at the beginning because often in enhancing our relationships that's one of the things we overlook. 

00:22:00
GAY HENDRICKS Because as you all well know, when you start raising kids and we've raised a couple. And when you get involved in activities and things like that, one of the first things to go, often times is the quality of the connection between you. You get so focused on the doing of relationship that you lose focus on the being of relationship, so we've worked out a lot of activities that we've taught to thousands of couples about how to really be present with each other. And one of the most common complaints that we've heard over thousands of couples sessions over the years is that, " he's never there for me when I've tried to communicate my feelings". "She's never there for me, she's not present for me when I'm trying to tell her about some work problem." It's a complaint about not being present or not being listened to. One of the most practical things you can do to learn how to be more present is to pay attention to your breathing. The reasons that's so important is when any animal, any human being gets scared, we tighten up our bellies and start breathing more up in our chests and scientists call it the fight or flight reflex. We started noticing it, 20, 25 years ago with couples where one person would be trying to speak their feelings to another person. One person would be saying, I'm angry with you or I was mad at you this week or I felt afraid or I felt hurt. And we noticed that the other person would be huuu. 

00:23:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Holding their breath. 

00:23:30
GAY HENDRICKS Holding their breath. And so, we just caught onto the simple power of having people learn how to take what we call a centered breath. And so, we want to focus a little bit on that very practical thing today so that you can learn how to be present. 

00:23:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS One of the things we noticed too, is like, in the middle of a conflict, if we drop into breathing together, we establish again our basic connection and it also takes us out of that state of fight or flight like it's a life or death battle with each other like, you know, I'm gonna win or you're gonna win back to, Oh, I remember who you are and why we got together in the first place and it will often shift us out of the place of conflict and the solution will emerge, sometimes quite magically out of just reconnecting with that simple hah breathing together . 

00:24:30
Creating Connection Activity Conscious Breathing 

00:24:30
Conscious Breathing Pay attention to WHERE you are breathing. Relax your stomach Start your breath in your abdomen Arch you back with an "in" breath. Flatten your back with an "out"breath 

00:24:30
GAY HENDRICKS So, if you think of, uh, breath in many languages is the same word for breath is the same word for spirit, in, uh, latin, in greek, in, uh, many of the world's languages. They talk about spiritus, being the breath and so, if you think of your breathing being the very essence of who you are. The thing that you can't do without from moment to moment. Learning how to breathe and be present with each other is a way of celebrating the essence of your relationship, really celebrating the essence of who you really are and being able to be present for the essence of who the other person really is. So we're going to get a couple of chairs and, uh, show something with, uh, Don and Angie and then have everybody, uh, practice it at home and, um, in the audience here. The first thing to do is pay attention to where you're breathing, in your body. When you get into fight or flight breathing, when you get scared, here's what will happen, your belly will tighten and your breath will come up more into your chest. So that, do that with me. Uh, try it on, if you would, a couple of times. So tighten your belly, and breathe a little higher up into your chest. And notice that your shoulders tighten, the back of your neck tightens, you stiffen up, you begin to go into the fight or flight reflex. 

00:25:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Do you start feeling a little more anxious, if you do that? 

00:25:55
DON Getting short of breath. 

00:25:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yes. 

00:25:55
GAY HENDRICKS Getting short of breath, yes, and if you continue to do that, you'd get uncomfortable very quickly. You'd get to feeling anxious even if you weren't anxious already just because of the way you breath . 

00:26:05
DON I'm kinda tired like, kinda (crosstalk) being drained. 

00:26:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS (crosstalk) Feeling tired. And, uh, right. 

00:26:10
Conscious Breathing Pay attention to WHERE you are breathing. Relax your stomach Start your breath in your abdomen Arch you back with an "in" breath. Flatten your back with an "out"breath 

00:26:10
GAY HENDRICKS Yes. Exactly. So now. let's relax your stomach, relax your belly. And take a breath that moves the belly first, that moves your abdomen first. So, if you watch here, for a second, you'll notice that I start the breath here and then it goes up here. When you're in fight or flight breathing, you start it up here and it never gets down here. So aim your breath a couple of times for down in your abdomen. Down in your stomach, down in your belly area. 

00:26:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, if you'd like, you'd be filling a bottle from the bottom up so you wouldn't fill a bottle from the top. So, if you think about you're pouring air into your body from the bottom up and I'm gonna come over and just help a little bit to show you where the breath is gonna come while Gay's talking about it. 

00:27:00
GAY HENDRICKS The other thing to do that you'll notice is, um, healthy babies do when they breathe is they breathe into their bellies and they also let their spines flex with each breath. They arch their backs slightly when they take an in breath and then when they take an out breath, the small of their back flattens or rounds. So they arch their back slightly on the in breath when they breathe into their belly. And they flatten the small of the back when they breathe out so their spine flexes with each breath, which is probably why a baby can lie in a crib all day long and never get a sore back, where if you or I tried to lay in bed all day we'd probably end up with a sore back after a while because we forget to use our spines when we breath. So, while we're doing this exercise, we'd love it if all of you would just pay attention to where your breath is and when you notice you've stopped breathing or started that fight or flight reflex, go ahead and let your spine flex with your breath and let a breath pump down deeper into your belly. So we'd like to, um, do a little activity now, uh, with both Don and Angie and then we'll extend it to the rest of you. 

00:28:10
Being Present Step 1 Turn & face your partner Make eye contact Take a few easy breaths 

00:28:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, what we'd like you to do to begin with is get comfortable turning and facing your partner, make a little eye contact and let yourself come into that easy, relaxed, belly breathing where you let your spine arch and round as you're breathing. 

00:28:35
GAY HENDRICKS So step one is to face each other, make eye contact and take a few slow, deep, easy breaths, just being present in the relationship. That's step one. 

00:28:45
Being Present Step 2 designate one person as "Explorer" & one person as "Being Present" for the Explorer. 

00:28:45
Being Present Step 2 Explorer - take 2 or 3 slow deep breaths while you are paying attention to your shoulders and neck. 

00:28:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And then step two, you'll designate one of you to be the explorer and one of you to be the person who's being present for the explorer. So just decide who's going to do that and then, Explorer, you're going to let yourself take two full relaxed breaths while you focus your attention on your shoulder and neck area. 

00:29:15
GAY HENDRICKS So step two, is to designate an explorer and a person who's being present for the explorer. The explorer take two or three slow, deep breaths while you're paying attention to your body sensations. 

00:29:25
Being Present Next Step Make one short out breath statement of your body sensations in the shoulders and neck. 

00:29:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Then when you've taken those two relaxed full breaths while paying attention to your body sensations in your shoulder, you'll make a one out breath statement. A short statement, keeping it really simple, about whatever body sensations you noticed. 

00:29:45
GAY HENDRICKS Just make a simple statement of anything you've noticed and do your best to keep it non-judgmental, not whether it's right or wrong, just anything you've noticed, like I feel some tension or I feel angry or I feel scared or I feel excited or I feel happy. Just anything that's a simple statement of whatever you noticed at the sensation level in yourself. 

00:30:10
Being Present Next Step Make one short "out-breath" statement of your body sensations in the throat and chest. 

00:30:10
Being Present Next Step Continue with waist and navel . 

00:30:10
Being Present Next Step Switch "Explorer" & "Being Present" roles. 

00:30:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And the person who's being present, you'll keep breathing and being present for your partner while they're exploring. So the next step would be for the explorer to shift your attention to your chest and throat area while you're taking two relaxed breaths and then again when you've finished taking your two relaxed breaths to make a one out-breath statement of any body sensations you noticed in your chest and throat area and again, person who's being present you'll simply keep breathing and being present for your partner and then the next step would be to focus your attention on your waist the area around your navel while you take your two relaxed breaths and then to make a short simple statement of any body sensations you noticed. When you've completed doing that, then it will be time for you to switch with your partner and go through those steps again with your partner being the Explorer and you being the person who's being present. 

00:31:20
GAY HENDRICKS One of the things to remember is not to give yourself a hard time when you're not staying present. And it's just kind of an automatic pilot on an airplane gets to Hawaii by being wrong, most of the time. It drifts off, then it comes back, it drifts off and then it comes back so there's no penalty for drifting off, just notice it when it happens and just kinda bring yourself back into the present. 

00:31:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So go ahead and make eye contact with each other and just as you do that. Notice if anything happens to your breathing. Most of us when we make contact with another person, that will make a shift in our breathing. So if you've noticed that your breathing gets a little stiff or your body gets a little stiff, go ahead and stay in eye contact and let yourself shift to that, easy, relaxed breathing where you're filling your body with the "in-breath" from the bottom-up. Great. 

00:32:15
GAY HENDRICKS And let your spine move like one of those happy, healthy babies, so let your spine move with your breath. And here, you're simply being present with each other. A metaphor that goes along with being present is that you're celebrating the essence of your relationship, why you really came together in the first place. So easy to lose that when you're raising kids and being busy with work and those kinda of things. It's very easy to forget why we're together, so take a breath, just take a big easy breath as a celebration of the essence of why you're here and who you are and what you have to share with this other person and why you love this person to start with. 

00:33:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So Don, I'd like to designate you as the explorer for right now and I'd like you to be continuing to breathe and noticing and just being with Don as he's noticing. What I'd like you to do is to put your non-judgmental attention, just noticing what goes on in your shoulder and neck area as you take a couple of relaxed centered breaths. So, you're doing something that most people don't ever do which is to notice something while not doing anything about it, so I'd like you to just notice this zone of your body for a couple of breaths and then I'd like you to just tell Angie whatever you noticed. Whatever body sensations you noticed as you were taking a couple of breaths. 

00:33:55
DON I noticed first I was, uh, kinda tense, you know, and drawn in. and after a coupla breaths, I feel kinda relaxing with the weight taken of the top of my shoulders. 

00:34:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So you -. 

00:34:10
GAY HENDRICKS You first noticed some tension and then some relaxation like the weight was taken off your shoulders. 

00:34:15
DON I felt like I was being pressed forward, like in a defensive posture, so to speak. 

00:34:20
GAY HENDRICKS Pressed forward? 

00:34:20
DON Yeah, pressed forward, like I took the breaths and I was more in a relaxed state. 

00:34:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Okay, great, so you felt yourself being able to let go of some of that defensiveness as you were breathing. 

00:34:35
DON Yeah, you know, a bag of groceries or something on your shoulder and it's kinda like you put it down, it's kinda like huh. 

00:34:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Well this is one of the burden areas of the body. This is a lot of where people hold responsibility and when we're carrying a lot of burden, this is one of the places in the body where that registers, so it's great that you were able to notice that and let go of that. 

00:35:00
GAY HENDRICKS Angie, tune into what you were experiencing for a moment and just notice any urge that may have come up in you to want to fix his tension or want to do anything about it. One of the hardest thing in relationships is simply to be with our partner while they're communicating something like I feel tense or I feel angry or I feel scared or I felt hurt. So, uh, what did you notice there as you were doing that? 

00:35:30
ANGIE When he was talking, you mean? 

00:35:30
GAY HENDRICKS Yeah. 

00:35:30
ANGIE Um, con, you know, concern for his , sometimes it's hard, I know it's hard for him to talk about that so I, but I was also like really proud of the fact that he's tuned into it, to feeling that, you know. 

00:35:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yeah. 

00:35:45
GAY HENDRICKS So, you're proud of him for feeling that and concerned that sometimes -. 

00:35:50
ANGIE Yeah, yeah. Cos mine was when we first started, I could tell that he was like forward, but the opposite's for me like I draw back. 

00:36:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS You draw back with him leaning forward. Oh, so it gave you an opportunity to really notice him and to also be aware of how you usually respond. 

00:36:10
ANGIE Aware of our differences. 

00:36:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yeah. 

00:36:15
ANGIE I mean, just because we're not reacting the same doesn't mean we're not having the same types of feelings. 

00:36:15
GAY HENDRICKS Ah, great awareness. It's okay for you to feel how you feel and okay for him to feel how he feels, great, that took me about 20 years. Glad it only took you two minutes. 

00:36:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS That's terrific. 

00:36:30
GAY HENDRICKS One thing to know about this particular activity, sometimes you'll feel tense, sometimes you'll feel relaxed, sometimes you'll feel different emotions like for example, the emotion of fear or the emotion of sadness or the emotion of anger ,everything is perfectly okay, you never know from one breath to the next what you're going to notice inside yourself. And one of the things that we found to be incredibly important in close relationships is learning how to be there for the other person, to stay present, no matter what it is they're feeling. Whether it's sad or angry or joyful or scared or whatever the particular emotion is, it's one of the biggest things we've ever learned in our relationship is just simply how to be present through whatever the other person is feeling. 

00:37:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So one suggestion that we have for our studio audience and also our audience at home is particularly when you're in conflict or feeling stuck or drained if you can just take a breath. It will really open up a possibility of being connected at a new level in your relationship. 

00:37:30
GAY HENDRICKS One of the things that we say around our house, you know, in movies and things, you see the phrase, somebody will say I'll drink to that. Well, around our house, we say, I'll breathe to that. So, uh, take a big breath for yourself, for the appreciation and take a breath of appreciation for your partner. Good, and all of you watching at home and practicing at home, take a breath of appreciation for yourself and those that you're in relationship with and let's all remember to keep breathing. 

00:38:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Hmmm 

00:38:00
JON CARLSON The importance of presence and breathing is something that seems to be so overlooked in relationships. We keep wanting to solve problems or to eliminate conflict and yet most people are probably not in the same place at all. 

00:38:15
GAY HENDRICKS That's really true. Einstein once said that you can't solve a problem in the same state of consciousness that created it and so taking a few simple breaths and getting present is a way of shifting into a state of consciousness where you can actually solve a problem. 

00:38:30
JON CARLSON It's almost like the Buddhists, uh, who will have I am present for you, they say as they breathe and concentrate and focus on one another, such an important idea. 

00:38:40
PAT LOVE Well, as I was watching, I was aware of how anxious I live, I walk around in such anxiety and, and I got anxious watching, so I have a coupla questions, for those of us who really have difficulty because I have to say when I sit down and think of just being that present, my anxiety goes up. So, do you have a tip for someone like me? That, okay, how do I use this at home, I mean, how do I really get myself to that point? Because I do get fearful, just being that, it just feels awkward, I guess. It just looks unnatural and feels awkward. 

00:39:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It can, a, at first, because most of us are so used to breathing in this fight or flight way, I think it's really important to first just acknowledge that, that you feel anxious. We often will have people do just what we were doing with you which is to do the fight or flight breath first to really acknowledge that that's how I'm feeling. I am feeling anxious and then to make a shift and that can be particularly valuable like for example, coming home from work after you've had a very stressful day. Rather than saying, just relax, just relax, it is to say, o what a day I've had and then ha. Make that shift. 

00:39:50
GAY HENDRICKS And I think, also you're pointing to something really important which is that most of us since we haven't been really ever given much permission or trained to put much attention into how to be with ourselves. It first feels a little bit, uh, anxious or, uh, unsettling when we first begin to tune in and, uh, I, my own experience, took me two years to learn how to breathe correctly. 

00:40:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:40:15
GAY HENDRICKS I really learnt that I didn't know anything about breathing when I first started. And so we have to give ourselves plenty of permission to practice. 

00:40:20
PAT LOVE As a person who has resistance to this type of exercise, every single time I've done, it's been powerful and I'm glad I've done it. 

00:40:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Um, great, thank you. 

00:40:30
Creating Connection Exercise 2 Commitment 

00:40:30
JON CARLSON Well, now that we've got the importance of presence, I think, following that, now let's move onto commitment, and help our audience and our viewers with the concept of commitment. 

00:40:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Wonderful. 

00:40:45
GAY HENDRICKS One of the most important things we've learned in our relationship and in the couples we've worked with is the power of commitment. Nothing much of value happens in relationship until people are committed but it has to be a special kind of commitment. We've found that commitment is one of the most misunderstood things in all of relationship and one of the most misunderstood aspects of commitment is the difference between an outcome commitment and what we call a process commitment. 

00:41:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Uh, an outcome commitment is what most of us are used to. That's like the traditional wedding vows where you say I promise to love, honor and obey you. That's what we would call an outcome commitment because we're trying to predict a result but we actually have no control over. The kind of commitment that we're talking about is a process commitment, that's a commitment over which you can take charge like I commit to revealing rather than concealing. 

00:41:45
GAY HENDRICKS So that's a process, you're committing to a process and you actually have some control whether in every moment you reveal yourself or conceal. So that if your partner says to you, how are you feeling and if you're really making good on your commitment to revealing, you'll say, I'm tired, or I'm scared, or I'm sad or I'm angry or I'm hungry, whatever it is because you're committed to revealing, you'll go ahead and reveal it. If you're committed to concealing, and many of us are, then you'll hide it and won't share it. So we're big believers in identifying several key process commitments because we've seen that there are 3 or 4 of them that really make a huge difference and we're going to work on a few of them today with you. 

00:42:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS One of the things, we'd like to have you also explore with regard to commitment is I think most people in our culture think of commitment as more of a straitjacket. So a lot of things that we've heard people say, you know, you better have a good time now because when you get into a relationship, it's all over. You know, you have to get in there, it's more like a prison and we really have seen that commitment is not only a foundation on which to build your relationship, it's also a place to come home to, so rather than being a straitjacket, it's a place you can come back to when you have the inevitable drifts that occur in your busy lives. And particularly, a commitment can give you a safe place with which you can explore then the deeper issues that come up when you get close to somebody else. If you have a commitment, I know one of the things I value so much in our relationship is because of our commitment I feel safe to bring up my deeper feelings, the things that have happened in my past that have been painful to me because I know that we are committed to telling the truth to each other and we're committed to our relationship as more important than either of us, uh, being right or being defensive. 

00:43:55
Creating connection Activity Step into your Commitment 

00:43:55
GAY HENDRICKS Another good reason for being committed in this new way that we're talking about is that if you're really committed to the other person. What that allows you to do is not only make a safe space for you to come home to, but it also allows you to get to the deepest level of the issues in you that'll take you out of commitment. So, for example, if you have abandonment issues in you, from your childhood or you've got approval issues or you're hungry for approval because of approval you didn't get as a kid. Those kinds of things won't really emerge until you make a fullscale commitment. It's as if we don't feel safe to bring up our deepest issues until we make a real strong commitment to another person. We've identified three very important commitments that we'd like to focus on with you here and, uh, have you experiment with at home. And. we wanted to, uh, um, show what that looks like, our particular commitment process with, we wanted to show what that looks like with, um, Kim and Si. And have you experiment with, uh, us on these while you all watch on and you look on at home and then we'll have everybody try on this experiment. 

00:45:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, when, you do this at home, we'd like to invite you, with your partner to stand and face each other. So if you could go ahead and do that with each other. In fact, I'd like you to stand a little bit further apart from each other. Because what we're gonna actually ask you to do is to step into your commitment when you say it. So, uh, Si, why don't we have you start first? And I'd like you to have you and I'd like to have you at home first just listen to this commitment and see what happens to you, what you notice inside as you say it inside to yourself. 

00:45:45
Activity, Step into your Commitment Step 1 Stand and face each other. 

00:45:50
GAY HENDRICKS So, step one, is to stand and face your partner. So just stand and face your partner. Take a moment to get comfortable, present, take a few deep breaths and then listen to the sound of this commitment and then we'll ask you to do something with it for step two. 

00:46:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS I commit to learning rather than being defensive in every relationship interaction. 

00:46:15
GAY HENDRICKS So, let's think about that together. I commit to learning rather than being defensive in my relationship interactions. It's a process commitment, it's something that you have control over, you can always shift to being open to learning rather than being closed and defensive in every moment of every relationship. 

00:46:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So Si, I'm going to say that again and when you're ready to, I'd like you to actually step into that commitment and say it. 

00:46:45
GAY HENDRICKS In your own words. 

00:46:50
SI I'm open to learning you in our relationship rather than being defensive. 

00:46:55
Activity, Step into your Commitment Step 2 Step forward and say, "I commit to learning rather than being defensive in every relationship together. 

00:46:55
GAY HENDRICKS Great, and take a breath or two and simply celebrate that commitment. So in step one, what you're really doing is stepping into a commitment, you're facing each other, you're thinking about the commitment and then you're stepping in to it with your whole body. So that you really get all of yourself into it and this commitment has to do with committing to learning rather than being defensive in every relationship interaction. 

00:47:20
Activity, Step into your Commitment Step 3 Step forward and say, "I commit to revealing rather than concealing in all my interactions with you." 

00:47:25
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Wonderful, so get a little bit more space from each other so Kim, I'd like to have you try on the second commitment and I'd like to have you at home and you here in our audience try this on inside and just see whatever reactions you have to this second commitment. I commit to revealing rather than concealing in all my interactions with you. So, just try that on inside and see what your mind and body, how they respond. 

00:47:50
GAY HENDRICKS And when you're ready, take a step forward into that commitment. 

00:48:00
KIM I commit to conce-, uh, revealing rather than concealing, um, in all the interactions of the relationship. 

00:48:05
GAY HENDRICKS Right, so, just take a breath into that. Take a moment to feel that, feel the power of that commitment. That's in fact, one of the most important commitments anybody can make in their lives whether or not it's in relationship, it's a commitment to revealing yourself rather than concealing yourself. Most of us learn to hide parts of ourselves for survival reasons growing up, and so when we come into relationship, we need to learn to reveal those parts of ourselves, to make it safe for ourselves to reveal ourselves and to allow other people to reveal themselves to us. 

00:48:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS People ask, "Can I be myself and be in a relationship?" and this commitment allows you to continue discovering who you are and discovering who your partner is. 

00:48:55
GAY HENDRICKS So, take a step a little bit, give yourselves a little more room. Take a few deep breaths, kind of get ready for this next one. 

00:49:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Cos, this one's the big one. 

00:49:05
GAY HENDRICKS This one's the big one. 

00:49:05
Activity, Step into your Commitment Step 4 Step forward and say, "I commit to shifting from blame to wonder whenever any conflict arises between us." 

00:49:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, again, both of you listen to this and you at home and in our audience listen, and see how your mind and body respond. I commit to shifting from blame to wonder whenever any conflict arises between us. 

00:49:20
Activity, Step into your Commitment Step 4 Step forward and say, "I commit to shifting from blame to wonder whenever any conflict arises between us." 

00:49:20
GAY HENDRICKS So, try this on, the idea of it. What destroys relationships is blame, what heals relationship is wonder. So, what we've found in our relationship and with the thousands of couples we've worked with is that people who are able to make the shift from blame to wonder, their relationships thrive and we're always going to get stuck in blame at sometime during the week whether it's driving on the freeway in the morning or thinking somebody has taken your screwdriver and hasn't put it back where it belongs or whatever the particular issue is. It's catching yourself in the midst of blame and shifting to wonder, as in, hmm, what can I learn from this? Or hmmm, what's here for me or hmm, how have I contributed to this situation. 

00:50:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, how about, Si, when you're ready to, I'll say this again and I'd like you to step into the commitment and say it out loud to Kim. I commit to shifting from blame to wonder whenever any conflict arises between us. 

00:50:40
SI I commitment, I commit to wonder rather than to blame when any conflict arises between us. 

00:50:45
GAY HENDRICKS Good, so take a moment to feel that, feel that in your body, feel that in your relationship, as you're doing this at home, do your best to feel the commitment, not just say it. 

00:50:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Now, we'd like to talk to you and work with you on now what do I do, I've made these commitments, now, how do I put it into practice. Because if you make a powerful commitment, the first thing that's going to come up is what we call a pop quiz. Now, it's going to be an invitation from the universe to really make good on your commitment and if you've made a really powerful commitment, you're not going to know how so we wanted to show you what we've found to be the most powerful move that puts your commitment into practice and that's what we call the central Hendricks aerobics move so we'd like to show it to you. 

00:51:35
GAY HENDRICKS Matter of fact, maybe we can get an example or two of something you, er, might blame somebody for in the relationship during the week or something somebody blames you for just so we'll have a real life example to, like for example, the last time you got into blame, what was the issue that was going on. 

00:51:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Or the last time you complained. 

00:51:55
GAY HENDRICKS Did somebody leave their socks on the floor? Or, what was it about? 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Icecubes. 

00:51:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Icecubes. 

00:52:00
GAY HENDRICKS Icecubes, what was it about the ice-cubes, Don? 

00:52:00
DON Uh, not filling the tray up. 

00:52:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Putting the ice tray in, not all the way filled up again? 

00:52:05
ANGIE No, not even putting it in. 

00:52:10
DON Not putting it back. 

00:52:10
GAY HENDRICKS Emptying the icetray and then not filling it, and then putting it back. 

00:52:15
DON Not putting it back. 

00:52:15
ANGIE No, not even putting it in. 

00:52:15
GAY HENDRICKS Not even putting it back. 

00:52:20
GAY HENDRICKS Oh yeah, this is the Hendricks Aerobics move, so stick out your arm, blame, okay. She's to blame because she's -. 

00:52:30
ANGIE Oh, it's you. 

00:52:30
GAY HENDRICKS Or he's to blame, okay oh, I thought it was Don, you were blaming her, you're the bad guy in this. Aahh, I getya. Okay. You had me fooled. Angie, ah, stick out your finger at him. Now he's to blame because he didn't, put it in your own words. 

00:52:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS This is what we do, this is what we usually start with so go ahead. 

00:52:55
ANGIE Okay, you're to blame because you always leave the empty icetray on the counter and I have to fill it. 

00:53:00
GAY HENDRICKS Okay, good and so, in the middle of that, shift to wonder. Hmm, make a hmm sound. 

00:53:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Just go ahead and go hmm. I know it sounds funny but hmmm- 

00:53:10
GAY HENDRICKS And just a couple of wonder questions, hmm, what can I learn from this? Hmm, what can I learn from this? Hmm, got any ideas about what you can learn from this situation if you weren't blaming? Hmm? Hmm? Just give you one that came to my mind, hmm, I wonder if we could afford an electric ice cube making refrigerator , hmm that would eliminate the problem technologically. 

00:53:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Another hmm response is, hmm, I wonder how I'm contributing to this problem. So when we shift out of blame, hmm. 

00:53:45
ANGIE Well, I wonder if I do the same thing. 

00:53:50
GAY HENDRICKS Ahh, I wonder if I do the same thing. 

00:53:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Ahh, so I might be contributing by doing the same thing only I don't notice it when I do it, I only notice it when you do it. 

00:53:55
GAY HENDRICKS Okay, so that -. 

00:53:55
DON Or I use the two ice cubes left and then I take them out -. 

00:54:00
GAY HENDRICKS In our relationship, our ice cubes is coffee grounds, I'm the culprit here in the family. I'm the coffee ground guy so, but we've all got something like that so stick out your arm in that blame mode. 

00:54:15
Activity Putting your commitment into Practice Do the "Ha" Move Blame your partner for something specific. 

00:54:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS In that blame mode and take a moment to blame your partner. 

00:54:15
GAY HENDRICKS Ha. Ha. 

00:54:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS That's what we call the "Ha" move. So actually, yes, Ha, and you at home, you would really do the (crosstalk) "Ha", the "Ha". 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Ha, ha. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Ha, ha. 

00:54:25
GAY HENDRICKS Have some fun with this now. Ha, we're very interested in learning through fun, not just learning through suffering, so have some fun with this at home, okay. Everybody (crosstalk) get a good Ha, Ha, 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Ha, ha. 

00:54:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Okay, and notice there's a certain amount of mmm. Mmmm, satisfaction in that. 

00:54:45
DON Tingly. 

00:54:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Tingly, yeah. 

00:54:45
GAY HENDRICKS Tingly, yes, you get a buzz from, ah, really blaming somebody, now, here's the acquired taste. Hmm. 

00:54:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS This is the aerobics move, you see, it's oiling this joint here. 

00:54:55
Activity Putting your commitment into Practice Do the "Hmmm" Move What can I learn from this? 

00:54:55
GAY HENDRICKS And notice it's not a Ha, it's not a blame move to yourself, it's a wonder move, it's shifting to wonder. And the wonder question is something like, "What can I learn from this?" right now and what could, what could be my contribution to this? How have I been setting up this issue? Hmm. 

00:55:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So you need to make the sound because you see it's very difficult to be critical when you're making a hmm sound, hmmm. So go ahead and try that out. Actually go hmm. 

00:55:25
ANGIE I feel like, um, this part was silly, you know, like. 

00:55:30
GAY HENDRICKS Yes 

00:55:30
ANGIE I kinda feel like why was I doing that? 

00:55:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS The ones that do, yes, but hmm, it actually shifts you into wonder, so go ahead and make the hmm sound a couple of times to just generate some wonder and try this on at home too. The hmm, hmm. 

00:55:45
GAY HENDRICKS So, if you possibly can at home, think of some particular issue that you have some blame about and something that's recycled in one of your relationships and the first step would be to just go ahead and blame. 

00:56:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS (crosstalk) Go ahead and blame. 

00:56:00
GAY HENDRICKS Nobody wants to stop anybody from blaming at first, let's just get the blame out. But then step two is to hmm. What's my contribution to this or hmm, what can I learn. So it's really a two-step process. Go ahead and get in blame, we're all going to lose it occasionally, we're all going to get into blame but then step two is hmm, coming back to wonder. Hmm. Remember that wonderful quote of Einsteins about you can't solve a problem in the same state of consciousness that created it. So while we're in blame, we're stuck in a particular state of consciousness. 

00:56:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And the other thing that will happen with that is that you'll start escalating the blame with each other and can get into a real power struggle and you might even enlist other people to prove your point of view. 

00:56:45
GAY HENDRICKS Yah, and that can go on literally for thousands of years and, uh, pass it down to your grandchildren and so what we advocate is that second step of coming back home to wonder, coming out of the state of consciousness that created the problem. That's locked into the problem and shifting into a state of consciousness where you can really maybe wonder your way to a new solution. 

00:57:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, the, ah, one other thing I wanted to say about shifting from blame to wonder is that the solution will often come up in its own time so we have the sense of, you know, gotta have the solution, right now but when I go, hmm, I'm opening a space for wonder and then the solution may come up when I'm, for me it often comes up when I'm brushing my teeth for some reason or another. It might come up when you're on a walk or you might be on the phone with somebody or see something on television that reminds you of a new solution. So let yourself be open to wonder. You can have your relationship be an ongoing space of wonder and when you catch yourself in blame, if you just shift into wonder, then that's the move we're really talking about, not making yourself wrong for blaming but when you notice go ahead and shift into wonder. 

00:58:00
GAY HENDRICKS Hmmm. 

00:58:05
[sil.] 

00:58:10
JON CARLSON Commitment, I thought it was my relationship with others and I found it really has a lot more to do with me and taking self-responsibility and so listening to you guys talk and work with audience, I wonder what their reaction is. What was it like for you to be a part of these exercises? 

00:58:25
DON Well, the hmm thing where you got the blame and you hmm, kinda, to me, it defused the anger, took away the edge of, of, the blame, you know, making it look inside and saying, you know, what did I actually contribute, you know, to this problem? 

00:58:45
JON CARLSON And so it looks like something that's just maybe artificial but it actually had a soothing quality, a change to what's going on. 

00:58:50
DON Well, it defused the anger, it kinda took away that tension of like you said, you're blaming and changed to what did I do to this, how did I cause part of this possibly? 

00:59:00
JON CARLSON Several people are nodding their heads. 

00:59:00
UNKNOWN But how do you get to that point because for me, it's like the adrenalin rush is like a swordfight, (crosstalk) you did that, you left the door open. 

00:59:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS (crosstalk)Oh you bet. That is so, it has that immediate gratification, kind of feeling we get a rush of adrenalin actually when we do this and that's a very addictive process, just chemically speaking. So it actually takes an act of courage, I think, to make that first shift because it might seem awkward, even silly to go, hmm. But when you've, when you've actually had that shift that you're describing about it will actually shift you into a place of possibility rather than the, the, the only thing possible here is escalation and the power struggle. 

00:59:50
GAY HENDRICKS One thing that really works is when you catch yourself in that swordfight, in that deep blame and the moment you catch yourself in one where you're totally convinced it's the other person's fault. Ah, but then you suddenly begin to consider the possibility you know that I might have to something to do with this situation. You know, like for me it was, you know ,thirteen relationships in a row where these women always leave me, you can't trust 'em and then to say hmmm, could this possibly have anything to do with me. Nahh, and number 16, 17, 18. 

01:00:35
PAT LOVE I really like the practicality of this because I know I'm gonna take home this visual, you know, from this to this. It gives me something else to do when I'm blaming, and we know that it's not whether you get upset or not in a relationship necessarily, it's if it escalates that leads to destruction and I really realize this can stop the escalation. And it's a reminder, it's like, not only visual but a kinesthetic reminder that when I'm doing this, that there's a second step to that. I really like that. 

01:01:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS You know what we call oiling the hinge. 

01:01:10
BEVERLEY I feel like it's the energy, like you're letting go of a lot of energy so I feel like you're pulling it back in or something, um, well and I think it's positive. 

01:01:15
GAY HENDRICKS That's a very good point. 

01:01:20
BEVERLEY Rather than releasing it all on to somebody. 

01:01:20
GAY HENDRICKS That's a good point because one of the ways we squander our power is by giving it away. You make me feel angry or it's your fault that this happened rather than hmm, breathing that back in. 

01:01:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Hmm, that's a great point, yeah. 

01:01:35
ANGIE The energy level, you know. I really noticed with Kim and Si, I couldn't see Si's face very well from where I was at but when Kim stepped into her commitment to reveal not conceal, her face, just, like, came up with all this energy. It was just really open and I wanted to say you looked really beautiful. It was just amazing actually, not that you looked beautiful but that it took just a few words to be able to get that. I mean I saw that energy. 

01:02:05
JON CARLSON This is a very deceptively simple exercise. 

01:02:10
KIM One thing is I've been surprised at, you know, with both us standing up there and then also just with the breathing and looking in each other's eyes is I don't know if I've had that presence since we were married. You know, I mean, because there's always been little distractions, I want, this brings us back to when we did take our vows. 

01:02:30
PAT LOVE What's that like? 

01:02:30
KIM It makes you realize, wow, you know, how much times passed and you know, I guess how important it is and how simple it is to bring it back together. 

01:02:40
ANGIE You know at first, it was a little kind of scary because we hadn't been there for a while and you realize how long it's been since you were in that spot and it's like when I get, you know, you really should open up to it and get back into it instead of like, you know putting blinders on or whatever that you go through with things. 

01:03:00
PAT LOVE What I'm so appreciating today is Kathlyn and Gay is that this doesn't cost money, it doesn't take a lot of time, it's not something, it's something that you really can weave into your everyday life. I mean, it's user friendly. 

01:03:15
GAY HENDRICKS Absolutely. 

01:03:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS That's our intention so as we said before, these things are all kitchen tested. We know, we know they work because, boy, if we can do them, you can do them. 

01:03:25
Creating Connection Exercise 3 Time Together 

01:03:25
JON CARLSON It really adds credence to that expression that you use 10 to 15 percent of your potential in your lifetime, it seems like we're all such underachievers when it comes to relationships. Let's move onto the next section in which you guys are going to help the audience and the viewing audience with time and spending time together. 

01:03:50
GAY HENDRICKS Very important. 

01:03:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Very important. 

01:03:50
JON CARLSON Very good. 

01:03:55
[music] 

01:03:55
GAY HENDRICKS One of the biggest problems people face these days is getting quality time together because as, as all of you well know and all of you at home know, things like raising kids, making a buck, doing all of those things is that modern life has in it like commuting, that kind of thing. It has a tremendous toll on it and one of the places it has its biggest toll is on the quality of flow of connection in a close relationship and so we found that we had to invent some ways of really keeping the flow of connection going, of keeping quality time together and there are a few ways you can do that that really make a difference, they're all very very simple but they have powerful results. 

01:04:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS The other thing that we notice in our own relationship and the couples that we work with is that we have different rhythms and we've never met a couple who had the same rhythm. I wonder if you and you at home have a sense of is one of you the one who's always waiting for the other when you're getting ready to go out. When you're making decisions is one of you the one who just can make the decision, the other one has to think it out, think it over and get all of the facts, the details and look at consumer reports. So we have this dichotomy in how we like to move through life and when we get together with another person, how we use time can really be a source of conflict so it's not only having quality time together, it's how we use that time and our own sense of time and one of the things we discovered in our relationship is that there's actually a pulsation of wanting to get close and wanting to get separate and that a thriving relationship has both. It has both times of closeness and times of independence. And if we don't give ourselves both of those, then we can create stresses in the relationship and actually create something that will give us what we need, like create an argument to have some separation but we don't actually get to enjoy that then because we're so annoyed at the other person. 

01:06:15
GAY HENDRICKS We had a couple, for example, where we caught onto this where they had this what they call the Friday night fights so they come home from work and they would have a whole weekend of potential intimacy together but then they would have a big boomer fight, Friday night and then they wouldn't get it handled all weekend., they'd, uh, kind of waste their whole zone of intimacy and so what we had them do. We realized that what they really needed when they first came home on Friday night was a little bit of solitude so we had them engage in 15-20 minutes of relaxation and meditation and that kind of thing separately and then they came together. And it basically eliminated the Friday night fights because what happened was they were trying to rush together and be close when they hadn't honored their need for individuation, for separateness, for some time inside. And so one thing, that we really want to encourage you to do and those of you that are watching at home is to really pay attention to both your need for closeness, for being close and in union with another person. And also honor your need for solitude, for alone time for quality time with yourself because a whole person needs to have both. A person needs to have alone time with yourself, with nature perhaps and a whole person also needs close contact with other people and both of those needs to be honored and we're always gonna be in different rhythms with that, with each other. Most people don't flow together back and forth just very naturally with their need for that, so it has to be communicated about. Another thing that we caught on to, is that people use business items, business around the house oftentimes as a way of interrupting the flow of intimacy so we've probably had 500 couples tell us a version of the following story. Somebody will come home from a trip or come home really looking forward to seeing the other person. "Hi, honey, I'm home." 

01:08:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Oh, I'm so glad, you're home because I can't find the check book and the plumbing, the plumber came, because the upstairs toilet, you wouldn't believe what happened with the upstairs toilet and Jimmy, God, he-. 

01:08:30
Creating Connection Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy 

01:08:30
GAY HENDRICKS Anybody sound, any of that sound familiar to anybody? Well, we've done that ourselves many times and so we caught onto a specific trick that we want to share with you to day and that's how to eliminate that particular problem so we'll get into the details of that in just a moment. Kind of, is our closing homework assignment for this particular segment. 

01:08:55

01:08:55
Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy Step 1 Turn and face each other (standing) Get comfortable where you are. 

01:08:55
Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy Step 2 Imagine a "Greeting" (coming together) 

01:08:55
Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy Step 2 Imagine a "Greeting" (coming together) Imagine a "Parting" (separation) 

01:08:55
GAY HENDRICKS What we're doing here is creating a zone of intimacy that can follow you around regardless of whether you're together or apart. So, we're very interested in creating a flow of connection between the two of you and for you folks who are watching at home to create a flow of connection between you and your partner that really transcends time and space that will be there whether you're standing a foot apart or 3000 miles apart on a trip somewhere so listen to what we're doing here as a way of creating a free floating zone of connection that you can take around with you wherever you go. So let's do step one. Step one is to turn and face each other. Go ahead and turn and face each other. And doing step one at home, we found it best to do this standing up and it will give you more room to move so please stand up and stand face to face. Take a few deep breaths, make a little easeful eye contact with the other person so you get a good flow of connection going and the first thing we'd like you to do in this step is just get comfortable where you are in the relationship right now. Just being right where you are, just taking a moment to tune into just where you are. So step one involves turning to face each other and simply getting comfortable where you are. In step two, we'd like you to use your imagination for a moment. I'd like you to imagine a greeting, in other words, when you come home in the evening perhaps or when you connect up with your mate after not seeing him or her for a while whether it's away at work or coming back in the evening, just imagine a greeting, imagine getting close, coming together and imagine now a separation., a coming apart, a saying goodbye in the morning or a waving goodbye as the person goes on a business trip. So imagine a separation, if you're watching at home then, step two involves imagining a greeting and imagining a parting, just kind of thinking of a coming together and a separation. And notice in yourself, which one of those felt harder. Did one of 'em feel easier or harder to you? Did you feel some glitches on one or the other? And what kind of glitches came up? Just anything you noticed, Don? 

01:12:00
DON The greeting, coming home from work, it's kind of, you know I don't have that time, I'm garaged by the kids or everything, you know, being jumped at like you were saying. I don't have that space just to kind of say huh, I'm home. I'm coming home and it's, you know, the fireman putting out fires. 

01:12:20
ANGIE Our greetings and separations happen at the same time a lot. 

01:12:20
GAY HENDRICKS Greetings. 

01:12:25
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Ahhh. 

01:12:25
ANGIE Because of our schedules, he's coming in and I'm walking out. So it was like, trying to find, think of a time when we can meet and actually be together after we're greeting. 

01:12:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yes, yeah, so I see, so it's kind of like an onslaught for you and a parting for you often. 

01:12:40
DON I'm coming home and if the kids have baseball or scouts or something, I'm, Hi, I'm getting them ready and then out the door. Or if she's going to the school, I'm coming in, it's like, you know. Hi, 'kay, see you later. I'll see you 10 o'clock when you come home. 

01:12:55
ANGIE Work. 

01:12:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS How about you, did you notice anything? 

01:12:55
SI Greeting was a lot more difficult because similar to their situation in when I'm coming home from work, the kids are also coming home from school and a lot of younger kids, so they competition to get everybody's attention 

01:13:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Right. 

01:13:10
SI Hey, you know, and not doing anything else and, uh, it's not very relaxing. 

01:13:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yeah. 

01:13:20
GAY HENDRICKS No, okay, so that's a stressful moment. 

01:13:20
SI Right. 

01:13:20
KIM I don't have that as much, I guess, because I'm surrounded by the kids all day. There's just no happy medium so the one thing that came across to me was I guess how similar, I'm really into touching and hugging and he's not but he accommodates me so I guess it always, you know, all endings, all greetings and departures- 

01:13:40
SI -with a hug. 

01:13:45
KIM -with a hug. 

01:13:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS With a hug, and that, so that's part of what you were imagining was that hug, that would keep the sense of connection to each other. That's something that means connection for you. All right, okay. 

01:13:55
Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy Step 3 Designate a person as "Home Base" and the other as "Explorer". 

01:14:00
GAY HENDRICKS It's a very simple thng to do but it has a lot of power so step one is to simply face each other and connect up. Step two is to imagine some meetings and greetings and just get a feeling of where the glitches are in your relationship about that and step 3 is to do just what they were doing to talk about that a little bit to share some of the things that came up. Just as a way of getting a sense for you in your body and in your mind of what these coming together and going apart are. Remember, what we're doing, we're creating a free floating zone of intimacy that you can take with you wherever you go but to start that, you often have to begin with a discussion of where the glitch points are and the stress points are in the relationship as far as coming together and going apart. 

01:14:45
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So the next step is going to involve one of you being, uh, taking the role of "home Base" and one of you taking the role of Explorer. So just take a moment to just decide who's going to do what and for you at home, take a moment to decide who's going to be the first home base and who's going to be the first explorer. 

01:15:00
GAY HENDRICKS So who's Home Base over here? 

01:15:05
ANGIE You explore. 

01:15:05
GAY HENDRICKS And you're Home Base, okay 

01:15:05
KIM Home base. 

01:15:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And you're going to be Home Base and you're going to be Explorer to begin with. Okay, great. 

01:15:10
GAY HENDRICKS And if you're doing this at home, select the person who's going to be Home Base, you're going to be just rooted, standing there for a moment and the Explorer is going to be doing the moving, moving. And so, get yourself established in one of those two roles.

Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy Step 4 "Home Base" Get comfortable and be available. 

01:15:25
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Okay, so home base what I'd like you to do is to practice your easy connected breathing that we started with. So, I'd like you to let yourself be comfortable in your body and breathing and I'd like you to be available for contact with the Explorer, so you're available for eye contact and if the Explorer wants to make any touch contact, you're available for that. You're gonna be at home in yourself, breathing and being available for contact. 

01:15:50
GAY HENDRICKS So you're going to be a place for this person to come home to. 

01:15:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Home base. 

01:15:55
GAY HENDRICKS They go away and come back. 

01:15:55
Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy Step 4 "Explorer" Move away from Home Base Move closer to Home Base Stay in Motion. 

01:16:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Great, and Explorer, what I'd like you to do is to move away from Home Base and closer to Home Base. I'd like you to start really slowly just moving away and then moving closer. I'd like you to- 

01:16:15
GAY HENDRICKS If you're watching this at home, begin doing that right now, begin easefully moving away slowly and then coming back, that's all you need to do right now and we'll add some instructions to this as we go along. 

01:16:30
Activity Creating a Zone of Intimacy Step 4 "Explorer" Vary your speed Vary your direction Vary your levels 

01:16:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS What I'd like you to notice Explorer, as you're moving, is I'd like you stay in motion. You can go as fast or slow as you'd like to. In fact, I'd like you to experiment with how fast or slow you do and for those of you at home, I'd like you now to begin exploring with moving a little faster than you would normally move and moving a little slower than you would normally move. So stay in motion, keep going away from or closer to Home Base because the central question about this exploration is how do I know that I want to be close and in intimacy right now and how do I know that I want to have some time for myself right now and I want to be individuated and independent right now. The more we can know that consciously the more we can communicate that to our partners and stay in a flow of connection whether we are apart or whether we are together. So now, Explorers I'd like you to add a couple of other things so I'd like you to keep moving closer to and further away. I'd like you to move in a couple of different directions now, so you might be coming up from behind, you might be moving your back away. 

01:17:40
GAY HENDRICKS Always in the act though of either getting closer to or further away. That's your intention, at any moment, I'm either moving closer to, that's my intention or I'm moving away from the other person, for no reason at all. Just feel in your body when it's time to move back and when it's time to move closer. 

01:18:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Okay, so go ahead and do that. 

01:18:00
GAY HENDRICKS From different directions, if you're watching this at home, go ahead and explore some different dimensions, come up from behind and move in from the side. Always staying in motion and always paying attention to your breathing and the sensations inside of your body. 

01:18:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Let yourself experiment too with different levels, so you might come in a little lower or go out a little higher from your partner, so you're experimenting now with levels and directions and speed. You're going fast and slow and high and low. Just seeing how it feels to you and what you notice about your comfort in getting close and getting separate as you do that. 

01:18:45
GAY HENDRICKS So the important thing that we're doing here is establishing your sense of what it's time to get closer to and when it's time to individuate a little bit and to be willing to be honest about that and to speak about that freely. Remember the problem that we talked about earlier, about how one person comes home, really looking forward to speaking with the other person, being, having some intimate time and then the other person says-: 

01:19:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS The bills, the checkbook, the plumbing. 

01:19:15
GAY HENDRICKS We've found that a trick that we use all the time in our relationship and we've taught it to thousands of couples and I'd like to share it with you and I hope you find it useful. Here's what you do, you set aside a business meeting once or twice a week. On busy weeks, we have to have two business meetings where we set aside half an hour to deal with things like paying the bills -. 

01:19:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Schedules. 

01:19:40
GAY HENDRICKS - schedules, who's going take someone to get their orthodonture fixed or all of those kind of things that can be done in a business meeting. So you separate it out and put it in a little separate category, like a little drawer, we have actually had it at key, at busy times in our lives that we will put items in so that we don't forget them, so we sit down for our business meeting and we go through our items, putting them on little scraps of paper and paper napkins whatever, we've written them down on. 

01:20:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So our assignment for you is to schedule a business meeting, schedule your first meeting where you can handle the business of your lives together, so that that has its own honored container and it doesn't spill over into the rest of your relationship together. Make a, schedule your first meeting for your business meeting. 

01:20:35
GAY HENDRICKS Why don't you go ahead and schedule one right now? Find when would be a time for your 30 minute business meeting. 

01:20:45

Creating Connection Activity Schedule A Business Meeting 

01:20:45
JON CARLSON I really appreciated your teaching us to take time for love and to sort business from being connected to as we miss so many opportunities, don't we, to really be connected with one another. 

01:21:05
PAT LOVE I would always think as time management as blocking off large and sometimes I get tight thinking about it, but what you're talking about is momentary. 

01:21:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Momentary, you know really catching the wave of possibility and riding it. I can't recall the number of times I lost the opportunity early in my relationship because I'd be doing something and he would come over to give me some positive attention and I'd be so busy doing something that I don't even see the possibility so that's really what we're talking about, making time. 

01:21:35
JON CARLSON What was this activity like for you in our studio audience? 

01:21:40
BEVERLEY It made me aware that I like being close. I didn't feel the need to move away once I was in the exercise as much as I thought I was going to want to move away. I was conscious of thinking I was going to be the person moving away and in fact I was much more comfortable closer. So that was a surprising for me, I didn't expect that reaction. 

01:22:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS That's something that you learn from this, that's great. 

01:22:10
UNKNOWN And I enjoyed her coming closer. 

01:22:10
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Ahhh. 

01:22:10
GAY HENDRICKS Worked both ways. 

01:22:15
UNKNOWN I felt like for me, it was like if I came straight at Beverley, it was too much for me to handle but if I came in at an angle, that was okay, um and then when I started doing different things like coming backwards or side, twirling, it got more fun and then I was able to do a lot more, um, closeness. 

01:22:45
BEVERLY You know I felt like when he was kinda coming at these strange angles, I just felt like it was a little personal because it was so different and new. 

01:22:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Different with him? 

01:22:55
BEVERLEY Felt a little, little scary, just because it was different. 

01:23:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS When we break out of these traditional roles with each other, it can be a little scary but, uh, as, uh, Fritz Perls, the great psychiatrist said that excitement is just fear without the breath. So when you're huh, take a breath to something new and it can open up a new possibility for you, to have a greater connection. 

01:23:20
BEVERLEY And then I also noticed that hell, I was more interested in watching his reaction to me moving on him more than myself, you know. Maybe that's all part of it, I don't know. But watching what your partner does, it's almost like calculating, you're getting closer and what is he gonna do? Is he gonna move away? It's kinda like a personal thing, you know. 

01:23:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It's very personal, yeah. This activity, when we, uh, do this with couples that we've worked with, they can find out, really the whole nature of their relationship with just a couple of minutes of doing this exercise. It's really good, as a kind of diagnostic assessment of how your rhythms in relationship and how you use your time together. 

01:24:05
GAY HENDRICKS One of the big things I learned actually along with that in our relationship is that I thought for many years I thought I was a confirmed loner, don't fence me in kinda guy and I learned that actually a good bit of that was based on I had a fear of being left, a fear of abandonment. I realized that I'd taken this loner stance as a kid because I was afraid that if I got close to people they would leave me. And so I didn't learn that until I was in my 30s when I got into my relationship with Kathlyn because I guess I had kept I submerged all of that time. But now I'm much more comfortable with touch and closeness than I was 20 years ago. 

01:24:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS No, you certainly are. 

01:24:45
JON CARLSON And speaking of appreciation - 

01:24:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Ah-ha. 

01:24:50
JON CARLSON - which you just demonstrated for us, that's going to be our final segment, why don't we move right into that 

01:25:00
[music] 

01:25:00
Creating Connection Exercise 4 Appreciation 

01:25:00
GAY HENDRICKS One of the big things that people really need to learn in close relationships is the power of appreciation. We gotta an experience many years ago that we really caught us onto this. We were invited to work with a group of couples one day when we were first beginning to work with couples issues and we had a room full of, probably about 40 people. And we had them take five minutes to complain about their partner, whatever they wanted to say and the room was deafening. People were so excited. 

01:25:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Bedlam. 

01:25:35
GAY HENDRICKS And then we rang a little bell and we said, now for five minutes, appreciate your partner. You coulda heard a pin drop. They were looking around, saying, how do you mean, how would I do that, what do you mean and so -. 

01:25:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS What's appreciation? I mean? 

01:25:50
GAY HENDRICKS So, we caught on in our own relationship, first to the idea that if we focused more on speaking appreciations to each other, at first it sounded a little bit awkward or artificial but as we began to focus on what we appreciated, a lot of our complaints dropped out. They would just spontaneously clear up without having to address the complaint and it's like that study that was done some years ago when they hung little voice activated microphones around the, um, necks of pre-schoolers and they just had them wear these voice-activated tape recorder for a week and then the psychologist analyzed the comments and then they found out 85 percent of the comments that were spoken to the children were negative in nature. Don't, quit -. 

01:26:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Stop it. 

01:26:35
GAY HENDRICKS Stop it. All these kinds of things that we soak up as kids because it makes us resistant to receiving positive energy in the form of appreciation and makes us resistant to speaking positive appreciation to others. 

01:26:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And the power of appreciation can not only shift the whole nature of your relationship it's really a way of focusing on the essence of your partner. Who you really are, so if you're looking for what's right, what's right tends to emerge between you and you can actually fill your emotional bank account with appreciations. It's one of the simplest ways that you can affirm the connection between the two of you and we started out with an intention to with each other once, I think it was once a day that we started with and then we moved to (crosstalk) once an hour. 

01:27:35
GAY HENDRICKS (crosstalk) Once an hour. 

01:27:40
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And now, we start out the day with appreciations and there's probably not very much time that goes by that we're not appreciating each other in one way or another. And what it tends to then is to make a whole different atmosphere of your relationship rather than looking at your partner as somebody that is your own personal improvement project. You look at them as somebody to celebrate and just by making these simple appreciations, I find that I, I keep discovering more things to appreciate. 

01:28:15
GAY HENDRICKS That's the nice thing about appreciation, the more you do it, the more you find to do it. And not just in close couple relationships too, but we also do the same thing with people who work with us, colleagues and friends. It's looking for something to appreciate about them and we find that often, you're not denying complaints, you're not denying the negative, it's just that you want to balance it out by speaking appreciation. And then the other, comes into some semblance of balance. If you think about it, there are 360 10 second blocks in every hour and all we ever ask people to do at first is to ask people to take one of those 10 second blocks out of the 360 of each hour and speak a 10 second appreciation to the other person, and it needs to be spoken because we've had many people in our office who say, "Well, gee, I appreciate you, honey." And the other person says, "It would have been nice to have heard that somewhere over the last 35 years." And so, um, so we say first get one of those 10 second blocks out of the 360 an hour and speak an appreciation. Let me give you a couple of examples. Like this morning, I think the first thing I said to Kathlyn, I woke up around, oh, ooh, 6 o'clock and she slept til maybe 6:30 or so, so the moment I saw some activity over there, when she began to crawl out of the covers, I said, "how is my gorgeous wife this morning?" and just a kind of positive thing to salute her as she came into the day and so I always like to make the first thing out of my mouth to her in the morning something positive that sets a tone for the where I want to go during the day to celebrate her. 

01:29:55
KATHLYN HENDRICKS One of the things that I most appreciate about you is the quality of your voice, I even wrote a poem about it because I, uh, when I hear your voice, it resonates in this place in me where I feel totally at home and I so appreciate the way that you share this whole range of like a vast concert hall through your voice. 

01:30:15
Creating Connection Activity Giving & Receiving Appreciations 

01:30:20
GAY HENDRICKS Thank you, I appreciate that. So we're going to be focusing on how to give and receive simple appreciations as a way to flavor up your day with each other so that you have more of a flow of loving connection throughout the day. Terry and Beverley are going to help us demonstrate how to give and receive appreciation, one of the arts of a close relationship. Step one is to stand facing each other or sit facing each other, here we're doing it standing. Um, well, the first step is simply to connect up with each other, make a little easeful eye contact. Acknowledge your relationship. 

01:31:00
Activity Giving & Receiving Appreciations Step 1 Face each other Appreciate yourself and your partner. 

01:31:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS For those of you at home, this would be step one to face each other, either seated or standing, make some connection with each other. 

01:31:10
GAY HENDRICKS And take a moment in your mind and your emotions, inside yourself to really appreciate yourself and appreciate your partner. It's very difficult to give appreciation to someone else unless you're appreciating yourself , so step one involves simply coming into relationship with each other and taking a moment to feel appreciation for yourself and feel appreciation for your partner. Now, let's put some words to that because in step two we're gonna show you a simple way of expressing your appreciation and of letting your partner know you've heard the appreciation which is a very important part of it. You wanna speak but you also wanna make sure you get listened to, at the same time. 

01:32:00
Activity Giving & Receiving Appreciations Step 2 One partner says, "I appreciate myself for ..." The other partner acknowledges, "I hear that you appreciate yourself for ...". 

01:32:00
Activity Giving & Receiving Appreciations Step 3 Appreciate someone special in your life without whom you might not be here. 

01:32:00
KATHLYN HENDRICKS It also brings up an issue that's complicated for many people about appreciation and that is receiving appreciation. For a lot of people, it's easier to give appreciation than it is to receive, so this activity gives you the chance to both give and to receive so that you have that balance and that flow in your relationship and the steps very briefly are to stand and face your partner and then one at a time, each of you will complete the sentence, "I appreciate myself for ..." And your partner will say, "I hear that you appreciate yourself for and then filling in the blank and then your partner will say, I appreciate you for ... and then you will say that I hear that you appreciate yourself for ..." and then the third step is to appreciate someone in your life without who you wouldn't be who you are or where you are in your life. So that it gives both partners the opportunity to both give and receive appreciation. 

01:33:05
GAY HENDRICKS So, would you start first? 

01:33:05
BEVERLEY Sure. 

01:33:10
GAY HENDRICKS Okay, so take a moment and complete the following sentence: I appreciate myself for ... and then fill in the blank with something that you can feel some appreciation for yourself for. 

01:33:20
BEVERLEY Okay, I appreciate myself for my continuing education. 

01:33:25
TERRY And I hear your appreciation for yourself for your continuing education. 

01:33:30
GAY HENDRICKS Good, so you spoke it and you acknowledged it. At first, it may sound a little awkward, just because we're trying out new words and new ideas but that's perfectly fine, riding a bicycle was awkward the first time too. So that's perfectly fine. And so the next sentence, "I appreciate you for... 

01:33:50
BEVERLEY I appreciate you for your support in my endeavors. 

01:33:55
TERRY I hear you appreciate me for your endeavor. 

01:34:00
GAY HENDRICKS Your support. 

01:34:00
TERRY My support for your endeavors. 

01:34:00
GAY HENDRICKS Great, good. 

01:34:05
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yeah. So, yeah, just take a moment to acknowledge that really touched you in a way that she appreciates you for your support. Yeah, and that can be one of the big benefits of appreciating. It's another way of making really intimate contact with your partner. 

01:34:25
GAY HENDRICKS Now, let's move over to you for a moment then, Terry. Take a moment to complete that sentence that says, I appreciate myself for and fill in the blank for something you appreciate Bev for. 

01:34:40
TERRY I appreciate myself for being able to take care of our children. 

01:34:45
BEVERLEY And I hear that you appreciate yourself for taking care of our children. 

01:34:50
GAY HENDRICKS Good, so just take a moment and feel that appreciation. Great, I appreciate you for: 

01:34:55
TERRY I appreciate you for your enthusiasm, for going to school and continuing this education. 

01:35:05
BEVERLEY And I hear that you appreciate me for my enthusiasm and continuing my education. 

01:35:10
GAY HENDRICKS Great, Good. A breath.How does that feel inside when you hear that? 

01:35:15
TERRY Oh, I mean it's good. 

01:35:20
GAY HENDRICKS Great, let's do another activity, let's focus the attention on someone else, if it weren't for them, you might not be in this room today or you might not be in this relationship or you might not be where you are in this world like when I think of many people like that but I think of my grandmother who loved me so much when I was a little boy at a time when I very much needed it and she really took me in and loved me unconditionally and in a way is responsible for my being here, so think of someone without whose presence in your life, you wouldn't be here, right now. And if you wouldn't mind, look Terry in the eye and say I appreciate blank for their contribution to my life. 

01:36:15
BEVERLEY I appreciate my parents. 

01:36:20
GAY HENDRICKS Hmm, for their contribution. 

01:36:20
BEVERLEY For their contribution to my life. 

01:36:25
GAY HENDRICKS I can see that brings some tears up for you so let's just take a moment and really honor them. Yeah, beautiful, so we don't often take enough time to feel that appreciation and gratitude and speak it. So, I hear that you appreciate: 

01:36:40
TERRY So I hear that you appreciate your parents for their contribution. 

01:36:45
GAY HENDRICKS Yeah, great, beautiful. Good, just kinda keep breathing with whatever emotions come up. Those of you that are doing step three at home, be prepared for whatever emotion comes up. Step three involves tuning into someone whose presence in your life was so important that you might not be where you are today without them and then speaking that appreciation, if you're by yourself even, watching this tape, you could speak that appreciation over the phone or out into the air. If you're with somebody, just stand face to face and speak those appreciations. 

01:37:20
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Okay, so Terry? 

01:37:20
TERRY Ironically, I was going to, my appreciation for your mother for accepting me. 

01:37:25
GAY HENDRICKS Mmm, so I appreciate your mother for accepting me. 

01:37:30
TERRY I appreciate your mother for accepting me and actually bought us together. 

01:37:35
GAY HENDRICKS Mmm, and I hear: 

01:37:40
BEVERLEY And I hear that you appreciate my mother for her acceptance of you and bringing us together. 

01:37:45
GAY HENDRICKS Mm-hmm, good, so let's just take a breath of appreciation for your mom, for this great gift she's given you. 

01:37:50
KATHLYN HENDRICKS Yeah, thank you very much. 

01:37:55
GAY HENDRICKS Thank you very much, that was really beautiful. I appreciate you for letting yourself get into it and be touched by it like that. 

01:38:00
BEVERLEY Although that wasn't my intention. 

01:38:05
SI I appreciate myself for being a hard worker. 

01:38:10
KIM I hear you say that you appreciate yourself for being a hard worker. 

01:38:10

01:39:25
GAY HENDRICKS Hmm. 

01:39:25
SI I understand Kim you appreciate me for being there all the time when no-one else is. 

01:39:35
KATHLYN HENDRICKS And I notice a big burst of a smile there, warmth in your face. 

01:39:40
GAY HENDRICKS And all it takes is for one of those 10 second to really get into it and get really get out and it's really good. The next step of this activity is to think of someone who's contribution to your life was profound enough that you might not even be in this room without their contribution so take a moment and so take a moment, if you can think of someone, Kim and just speak that to Si. I appreciate blank for-. 

01:40:05
KIM Um, I appreciate (ph) Kaysha for coming into my life, um, Kaysha was a daughter that I lost. By going through that experience has made me a much more stronger person and helped me to overcome obstacles that I know I can do because I could do that. 

01:40:20
GAY HENDRICKS Hmm, I hear that you appreciate: 

01:40:25
SI I hear that you appreciate Kaysha for coming you're your life and giving you that strength to go out. 

01:40:30
GAY HENDRICKS Hmm, let's just take a moment and feel appreciation and open our hearts to Kaysha for that gift that she bought to your lives. Hmm, and, uh, Si: 

01:40:45
SI I guess I'm of the same accord as Kim, I appreciate (ph) Kila though for giving me a second chance of, to enjoy life again, having a little girl. I thought those things were all long and gone. I appreciate Kila. 

01:41:00
GAY HENDRICKS Hmm. 

01:41:00
KIM I hear you say that you appreciate Kila and that she's added to your life, a second chance. 

01:41:05
GAY HENDRICKS Hmm. So let's just take a breath of appreciation, open our hearts to Kila, feel our appreciation for her. 

01:41:15
KATHLYN HENDRICKS I'm really appreciating this because as we're doing this, I'm feeling more and more aliveness and more love in me, more love for you and for you all. I really appreciate you sharing yourselves. 

01:41:25
GAY HENDRICKS We appreciate that. 

01:41:25
KIM Thank you. 

01:41:30
SI Thank you. 

01:41:30
KATHLYN HENDRICKS So, for those of you at home, this is our assignment to you over the next 50 to 70 years, is to start with one appreciation an hour. Letting yourself have that 10 seconds of delicious flow of energy of appreciating and then let that develop so that your life becomes about celebrating and giving a . . .
