BEVERLY GREENE  Ah, my discussion this morning focuses on some of the factors that are irrelevant to the delivery of competent psychological services to members of marginalized groups in a contemporary atmosphere that is replete with social injustice. One of the most important aspects of this phenomenon is that we empower clients who are members of socially marginalized groups and not further injure them by either consciously or unconsciously acting out impressive ideologies. That repetition of injury to clients takes place whenever psychologists avoid examining the role of oppressive ideologies and mental health that facilitates social injustice, when they avoid examining the role of oppressive ideologies in creating mental health problems, when they avoid examining the barriers to culturally competent interventions, and when they avoid examining the discomfort associated with examining differences in psycho-therapy diet that are not simply a function of differences in human characteristics, but are manifestations of power and privileged differentials that are reflected in society at large and form the core of social injustice. Of particular importance is the examination of the therapist's personal stake in avoiding confronting these realities because of the therapist's privileged identities or wish for them. In this political climate, the consolidation of corporate power and greed is prioritized over health and the well-being of citizens, particularly those in our society who are already most vulnerable. Patricia Williams tells the following story in a law school class on women and notions of property to illustrate what she calls the symbiotics and rhetoric of power relations of dominance and submission, of deference, of big, and of little. As a psychologist, I find the story illustrates the salience of unexamined subjective cultural positioning that is a serious problem in clinical work. She writes, "Walking down Fifth Avenue in New York, I came up behind a couple and their young son. The child, about four or five years old, had evidently been complaining about his fear of big dogs. The mother was saying, "But why are you afraid of big dogs?", "Because they're big.", he responded. "But what's the difference between a big dog and a little dog?", the father persisted, "They're big.", said the child. "But there really is no difference.", said the mother, pointing to a large slathering wolfhound with narrow eyes and a calculated amble of a gangster, and then to beribboned Pekingese the size of a roller skate flouncing along in that little foxtrotty step that keeps Pekingese from ever being taken seriously. "See?", said the father, "If you look really closely, you'll see there are no difference at all, they're all just dogs". Williams writes the disposition illustrates the idiocies of high objectivity, and she uses that story to illustrate a paradigm of thought in which people who are insubordinate social positions as our children are taught to distrust and reject their own perceptions to not see what they see. Instead, they are taught to capitulate to the perception of dominant cultural beings and beliefs who fail to acknowledge the lens through which they view the world that is subjective and not objective. This story also serves as an appropriate metaphor for the way that socially marginalized people are taught to reject their own perceptions so that they do not see their exploitation. It also highlights the ways in which dominant cultural beings can become so immersed into what Williams refers to as "the authoritarianism of their own world view that they cannot only universalize their subjective view, but they can be oblivious to the fact that they are doing so". As clinicians, we are generally concerned with understanding and ameliorating mental health problems. There are many precedents for viewing social inequity as a significant factor in the emergence of mental health problems. I will site one example. Feminist psychology has carefully documented the ways in which social inequity and exploitation has been a significant factor in the mental health problems observed in women. Feminist psychologist concerns however were initially limited to women as targets of social inequity and for that matter, to white well-educated heterosexual economically well-off women. Despite their own marginalization as women, the early architects of feminist therapies were blind to their own marginalization of other oppressive social practices. That they, that they engaged in these practices and supported them, as well as their differential effects on women were not obvious to them. Only middle and upper class women would champion the right to work as opposed to having a choice about working or not as the key to women's liberation. Poor women and women of color have always had not only the right, but the requirement to work if their, if their families were to survive. In this manner, social class, class, ethno-racial and other inequities that all women experience as part of their dilemma as women are rendered invisible. The evolution of feminist theory by definition, had to begin incorporating an analysis of the interactive effect, of the interactive effects of other forms of social oppression and identities with the oppression of women expressed in sexist and patriarchal ideologies. Interactions between identities is becoming more prominent in our discussions of diversity and multiculturalism. As we move beyond the notion of people having one master identity that is more deserving of attention than others, uhm, to understanding that individuals have multiple identities that always interact simultaneously, and that anyone may be differently salient or meaningful at different developmental junctures and in different environmental context, and that anyone informs and transforms the experience of the others. However, when a society distorts anyone's identity and imposes barriers to opportunities or their basic survival on the basis of that identity, the groundwork has been laid for a distorted image of one's self, a distorted perception of others, perhaps, a limited sense of self, and perhaps a limited sense of self-worth. Furthermore, blocking access to goods and services on which survival depends, carries another host of negative effects on mental health. These are fertile conditions for the development of mental health problems. Mental health interventions may assist people who confront this dilemma, but when they are insensitive to social marginalization, or structured social inequity, as important contextual factors, they become instruments of harm and re-injure and or re-traumatize clients. The cultural identities or diversities that attract our concern in mental health include ethno-racial group membership, sexual orientation, sex, gender, ah, disability, social class, age, and perhaps others. These are not intrinsic properties of people, they are identities that have a history of being culturally and legally defined in ways that can confer social opportunities and advantages, or deny them to you. Oppressive ideologies take human characteristics and pre-dispositions that really exist in all people, and reduces them to dichotomous categorizations that apply selectively to some people or groups and not to others. That characteristic presumably explains our place in the social hierarchy and provides a rationale for exploiting those who are deemed unworthy. When this practice is legitimized by social institutions, we can remove ourselves from any personal responsibility for the harm that we do to people, and then, we can blame them for the ill effects of their exploitation. Oppressive ideologies privilege you if you have certain identities, and they punish you if you have identities that the dominant group devalues. Individuals who are reduced to that category, to the category that they belong to, and the rea, to the category that they belong to, and the reality of who they are becomes invisible. We must ask, what is reenacted in the therapy process itself when the clinician is a member of, or strongly identifies with the privileged or dominant group and the client is or does not. Michelle Owens writes, "That there is a potential in the scenario for the reenactment of the normative social power-relationship that is characterized by dominance and subordination, and that is incumbent on therapist to be aware of that potential and its damaging effects". Overall, there has been greater comfort discussing race instead of racism, sex differences as opposed to sexism, minority sexual orientations as opposed to heterosexism and homophobia. Boyd Franklin observes that if it were not for racism, sexism, heterosexism, ageism, placism, ableism, and other oppressive ideologies, the identities associated with them wouldn't really matter as much, nor would discussions of them meet with such clear resistance. Given the relational nature of social status, it also raises questions about the effect of the theoretician or clinician's position in their hierarchy. How do they, how do does the theoretician's subjective, social and cultural positioning, and their place in the social hierarchy affect the way they conceptualized the psyche and its operation? How does it affect the way they approach and understand the client, does it enhance that view or does it obstruct it? Any examination of the effects of social injustice tells us that patterned injustice at the very least leads to less than optimal functioning in any individual, but that is not the whole story. People who belong to marginalized groups are not inevitable psychological cripples, many develop a functional level of psychological independence, defined as the ability to mentally remove themselves from a level it influences and intent. This process is reflected in a reality that all marked marginalized people do not internalize distortions of themselves, and are not psychologically unhealthy. Elaine Pinderhughes(ph) observes that individuals who belong to groups associated with power and privilege, may be so used to negotiating reality from a position of power, that when they are not in the position of power, they're ill-prepared to cope. Hence, resilience is a function of exposure to enough adversity to require the development of strategies to negotiate it, but always in a context, where enough resources are available to do that. It would also seem that while it's important for individuals to be confronted with adversity rather than insulated from it, too much adversity with too little respite and too few resources can overwhelm almost anyone negatively affecting their ability to cope. Corneal(ph) West observed that in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, all Americans experienced the kind of social trauma that socially disadvantaged Americans experienced routinely and in a protracted fashion. Throughout our history, domestic terrorism such as the Ku Klux Klan and others, subjected members of marginalized groups to feeling unsafe, being targets of random violence of being hated and being unprotected, as many people in this nation felt after the 9/11 attacks. Despite this reality, the 9/11 attacks were often characterized in the popular media as the first attacks of terrorism on these shores. The invisibility of the victims of domestic attacks actively says that attacks on them do not matter and are not taken seriously. Understanding the dynamics of how many of these group members have responded in healthy ways despite their ill treatment maybe be of use to mental health professionals in assisting people who are coping with more recent forms of international terrorism and the psychological trauma that has been a result. It's important to understand the formation of psychological vulnerability and resilience in members of socially disadvantaged groups, if we wanna use our services competently and if we are to fully appreciate the sometimes devastating effects of social inequity. How is this connected to subjective cultural positioning, and what does that have to do with power and privilege and oppressive ideologies? My analysis takes place in the context of the Meritocracy myth, the myth of rugged individualism and some of the dynamics that are intrinsic to historical, to historical and contemporary social injustice and institutional mental health. Michelle Fienne(ph) observes that the myth of rugged individualism, the belief that everyone has choices and that opportunity is equally distributed or based on merit, requires an erasure of the history of social oppression and marginalization, what she calls eurobonics(ph), that is critical to understanding socially marginalized persons. In her analysis, maintaining that myth warrants idealizing dominant cultural group members in ways that requires keeping secrets about them to maintain the distortion that their idealization represents. It also requires maintaining silence about the pathologies of the institutions that we belong to, silence about the incompetence of dominant group members who are incompetent, as well as a deafening silence about who actually gets, but did not deserve. An example of this is reflected in the depiction of poor white people as trash. How is being white and poor different from being white or otherwise, poor? Our values are encoded in a language, and in this example, trash tells not just who they are, but also why they are. The reality of class oppression and social inequity is disguised by distorting the identity of group members and blaming them for their subordinate position. Judith Jordan observes that in the myth of the Meritocracy, achievements by members of privileged and powerful groups are attributed to their individual efforts and talents, and whatever rewards they obtain for their efforts are seen as having been earned and deserved. Conversely, people who are vulnerable and disadvantaged are presumed to be getting just what they deserve as well, that includes blame and contempt, and in psychotherapy practice, both client and therapist have their own personal stake and role in those beliefs. When psychotherapy paradigms legitimize the social status quo rather than critically examine it, we become instruments of social oppression and control, and by definition, contribute to social injustice and harm clients. Bonnie Strickland observes that in the history of institutional mental health, we have hospitalized, incarcerated and drugged the psychologically deviant. Although we give contingency of reinforce, contingencies of reinforcement, a polite nod, we continue to place the origins of psychopathology in the individual and not in the context of their lives. Anxiety, depression, dissociative disorders, anger, and rage, accurate perceptions of exploitation and attempts to flee from them represent behaviors the may be desperate and understandable attempts to cope with pathological life conditions or challenges. Even adaptive attempts to cope with social inequity, are themselves pathologized as expressions of defects in the individual. Normalizing the abnormality of social pathology driven by oppressive ideologies, i, ideology serves to obscure both the pathology of the dominant group, as well as the socially constructive nature of one's placement in the social hierarchy, it isn't about mother nature. When oppressive ideologies are operationalized, they represent forms of terrorism and they can create in their survivors, not simply a PTSD, but what Fienne(ph) calls a post-colonial stress disorder. Unlike PTSD, the traumatic process is protracted inescapable and systemically tied. As such, it comes to be perpetuated by people who may not even believe in the oppressive ideologist, ideologies that are part of the institutional structures. Jesicca Henderson Daniel observes a range of factors that interfere with our willingness and ability to appropriately recognize narratives about the role of social marginalization and trauma in client's lives. In her analysis, the sexual trauma of black women and their disclosure of those experiences highlight the intersections of race, gender, class and sexual orientation for them. In a historical context, who is accusing whom and of what, are critical social factors that influence the ability of therapist to hear social trauma in the client's narrative. She uses the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas cynic confirmation hearings as an example of the continued vulnerability of black women in the work place and the lack of recognition of that vulnerability even among other black women. Daniel writes, "That any analysis about black women's vulnerability is always subject to social beliefs about them and beliefs about others". What happen, happens if the victim is a black woman who was victimized by a white man, by a black man, by a white woman, or by another black woman? And what happens when class and education are a part of the narrative? I recall that many people, many black people often other women being furious with Anita Hill, not because they disbelieved her, but because they felt that she should be silent about racial dirty laundry, particularly if it was directed at a black man. Many asserted that because she was an educated woman, she surely didn't have to put up with harassmentof any kind. She could simply leave and find another job. The refusal to believe that class and education do not automatically protect black women from racial and gender vulnerability, led to the expectation that Hill should have been silent about her perpetrator and consequently her trauma. It also fuelled the belief that she and people like her could not be victimized, not only was her trauma unrecognized, but she was vilified as a traitor to the race. The therapist's inability to hear the potential for such trauma in a client results in further harm to them. Lilian Comas-Diaz uses the term "cultural ala danyo(ph)" to describe another form of social trauma characterized by extreme reactions to neutral or ambiguous stimuli caused by insidious ethnocultural injury. She emphasizes that diagnoses and treatment are political acts and suggest that the failure to acknowledge the political nature of those professional processes is an ingredient in the failure to see behavioral conditions as a function of cultural reality and power and not simply the properties of individuals. Hence, we must always be alert to identifying strategies that are designed to distract us from analyzing the political implications of our professional work. This is particularly important in mental health because the therapist's discomfort with these issues will affect their ability to hear the client's narrative. American legal scholar, Loni Guinere(ph) uses the miner's canary as a metaphor for political race. Miners often carried a canary into the mines with them, as the canary's fragile lungs would cause them to expire from the invisible and odorless toxic gases in the mines long before it would affect the miners. Hence, the canary alerted the miners to the poison in the air so that they could get out of the mines before it overpowered them. In mental health paradigms, I would extend that analogy to the mental health distress among people who belong to marginalized group, poor people, people of color, sexual minorities, women, people with disabilities, and old people. Their distress has been viewed historically as an expression of their personal pathology or their group's defect. However, they are very much like the miner's canary. Like the canary, they are deemed expendable to dominant cultural members, and there is a tendency to think that they are, that they are sacrificed, the only harm is done to others like them. In reality, members of these groups are like the canary, providing society with a distress signal. If we ignore problems that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable members of our society, we do so at our own peril, because those symptoms are not an expression of their defect, their conditions are telling us about a larger, more insidious problem. Their distress is the first sign that there is poison in the air in the form of toxic social conditions. If left alone, those conditions will negatively affect everyone. Our task then, is not to exhaustively study canaries or view them as having defective lungs, nor is it to prescribe exercises to help them hold their breath for longer periods or to make tiny canary gas masks to help them better withstand the toxic air, nor is it to rehabilitate them after they passed out. In the miner's analogy, the problem was not the canary, it was the gas in the mines. Many mental health problems are not a function of defective individuals, they're a function of social inequities that have toxic effects on everyone when left alone for too long. Clinicians personal convictions often interfere with hearing a client accurately, and often represent dominant cultural beliefs that are simply accepted without question. This results in a failure to critique social pathologies that do not personally affect the therapist. How the therapist is raised, gendered, aged, sexually oriented, whether or not they are, have a disability, affects what they chose to see and what they choose to avoid just as it does in clients. Similarly, theoreticians' understanding of the order of the world via their subjective cultural lens informs the theoretical explanations they put forth about human behavior, as well as their willingness to examine the nature and constituents of social power and privileged identities in both client and therapist's lives. To avoid experiencing shame and discomfort about privilege, we must deny the reality that having a privileged identity means we may well profit at someone else's expense. That denial becomes even more difficult if we hold the social privilege and we encounter clients who are disadvantaged around that characteristic. The encounter itself can illicit discomfort even if the differences and their meaning are never overtly discussed. When the reality of privileged, privileged materializes, it also challenges therapist's personal beliefs about who they really are. It is unlikely that these issues can be confronted in a client without scrutinizing and challenging one's own sense of self as a mental health service provider. That task can be painful and difficult, but is, it is a necessary undertaking. Raoul Moncaio(ph) also suggest that hierarchical divisions may be found within marginalized groups that are just as tenacious as those between marginalized and dominant and privileged groups. All members of disadvantaged groups are not equally disadvantaged and all do not automatically learn to be any more tolerant of differences than members of the majority. Like members of dominant groups, members of disadvantaged groups with privileged identities may often deny those privileged identities, preferring to focus on their locust of disadvantage. It is usually the dominant voices of any group that are most privileged that often speak for the entire group because they control the group's venues. Cultural sisterhood and brotherhood, after all, have all of the complexities and rivalries of sibling and other familiar relationships. The reality however, is that those feelings about power, powerlessness and social injustice exist within the therapy process whether or not we address them. If they are avoided, they become insidious and potentially injurious to clients. Therapy as a process may offer both client and therapist an opportunity to develop connections across differences and power differentials. Maureen Walker writes, "That psychotherapy's purpose is to move toward healing that takes place in the context of a relationship and an empathic connection between ourselves and our clients". This is difficult when our practice is embedded in the culture where disconnection is valued over connection. It is made even more challenging when differences in the dominant culture of the United States are usually managed by hierarchical power over arrangements. Walker defines power over as a cultural arrangement in which difference is stratified into dominant and subordinate, superior and inferior categories. She suggests that both client and therapist who both have multiple identities are carriers of potential cultural disconnections in this context. These potential disconnections are implicit in the therapy process because they are implicit in every aspect of all of our other relationships in society. She uses the term, "shifting vulnerabilities" that are associated with those different identities as characteristic of that process. When vulnerability is evoked, either person may need to avoid the threatening and sometimes painful feelings of vulnerability that are associated with having certain cultural identities. When we attempt to connect with clients or with people in our lives across different identities, and the, and the dynamic, the dynamic of those shifting vulnerabilities is activated. And inevitably, the vulnerability that is associated with the particularly, particular identity or identities, is evoked. Fear is often evoked with it. If either gives in to the need to avoid those feelings of vulnerability, an impasse occurs that blocks any attempt at, at empathy, mutuality, reciprocity and connection. When avoidance does occur, but the therapist recapitulates the relationship characterized by dominance and subordination, normative in the broader society, not only is connection blocked, but painful violation and injury to the client occurs. Therefore, connections across power differences, as well as perceived similarities, by definition harbor the potential for conflict. However, Walker observes that relational conflict across differences can represent an end-point whether we are at a therapatic, therapeutic or relational impasse, or we persist in negotiating that conflict, it represents a juncture that holds the potential for deeper connections. She credits her husband for the metaphor for cross-racial connection that I used here to describe the process of relating across all differences, particularly those that are associated with differences in social power. Attempts to relate and bridge connections across differences in power may be likened to being in a boat leaving a safe harbor to reach another shore. In the midst of such a journey, we will inevitably find ourselves at sea, encountering raging storms of anger, guilt, humiliation and often despair. Those who don't encounter the storms are not really in the boat. Competent psychotherapies can be a powerful tool against social injustice when they empower clients to see what, in fact, they see, to correctly identify what others try to make of them, and the need of others to do, to do so. When they are accurately depicted and when they are not both at the level of their personal relationships, as well as where they are located in the social hierarchy. Such a process validates a client's accurate perception of social, as well as personal exploitation, as well as the appropriate negative feelings elicited by unfair treatment. It is helpful when it assists clients in consciously developing adaptive strategies for identifying and addressing ongoing forms of social trauma. The connection that can take place in therapy can be used to assist clients in making connections in their lives to others who share their dilemma if they have not already done so. To an awareness of the historical nature of a struggle that is larger than them, than themselves, and in so doing, to the range of survival strategies that have been used to historically to create a sense of resilience in group members. Every gender is raised, every race is gender-coded and everyone has a sexual orientation and a social class that influences the experience of other aspects of their identity. Many people have moved across the boundaries of gender, sexual orientation and class. People with disabilities constitute a group with permeable, permeable boundaries that make it potential, a potential identity for all of us. If we are fortunate enough, we will age and grow old. The average woman in America is not a size 6 or at least not permanently. As we consider a 21st century psychology in a climate that is replete with social inequity, we are challenged to abandon our caked notions of a master identity and acknowledge that the crucible of identity is really a kaleidoscopic matrix, matrix of identities in which we may occupy many different locations at once. That there is a multiplicity of identity in all individuals in which some identities are privileged and some are disadvantaged within the same person. That there is a complex inter-relationship of identities that interact in a dynamic manner that transforms and informs one another continually throughout the life span. That identity is defined more by context than by the property of persons. Multiple identity paradigms are inherently messy, and in the day today, they remind us of what we do not know, of how we do not know what to expect, when we begin to explore the, the complexity of human differences to the degree that we think we know what to expect. Vicky Mace(ph) offers that psychology must be willing to teach and develop a body of science that is informed by principles of social justice and social equity. In this paradigm, research about oppressive ideologies will help to make us more competent when treating clients who are different, as well as similar to us. She writes that when social justice informs our perspectives, we become aware that the behaviors that we deemed pathological, and become a focus of clinical scrutiny are often conditions that are connected to social inequities in health, education and welfare, as well as the very paradigms and policies of our own discipline and its practices. Failing to acknowledge and understand the broad and divergent role of social privilege and disadvantage in client's lives, and their role and our response to an understanding of differences ultimately undermines our attempts to deli, to deliver competent clinical services and celebrate the richness of human diversity. James Baldwin wrote, "You think your pain and heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, and then you read, and you discover that the very thing that torments you is the very thing that connects you to every person who is alive and to every person who has ever been alive". Thank you. Are we, are we taking questions? 

00:28:55
  Yes. Yes. We have questions. There are probably (inaudible [00:29:02.14]) 10 to 15 minutes. 

00:29:00
BEVERLY GREENE  I totally have time for questions. 

00:29:10
[sil] 

00:29:10
BEVERLY GREENE  It's fine with me. Hmm? 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:15
  Ask them if a...(crosstalk) 

00:29:20
BEVERLY GREENE  Hmm? 

00:29:25
 ...ask them if a...(crosstalk) 

00:29:25
BEVERLY GREENE You ask. 

00:29:25
 Are there any questions for Dr. Greene? Yes? 

00:29:30
 I'm wondering, uhm, brilliant, wonderful, thank you, very grateful. Uhm, there's this juxtaposition or paradox between the ah, canary, who you're not gonna put a mask on or you know, talk about how do you cope necessarily for that condition 'cause clearly it's the context. On the other hand, you did talk about ah, in (inaudible [00:29:57.00]) of helping people to identify and cope and adapt. So...(crosstalk) 

00:30:00
BEVERLY GREENE Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
 ...how do, I mean, there's always a point where metaphor ends and you need a new one...(crosstalk) 

00:30:05
BEVERLY GREENE Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
 ...and that one was brilliant and beautiful, but how do we deal with those to attention and how do we prioritize? 

00:30:10
BEVERLY GREENE I think one of the ways of doing that is in the course of helping people to manage those ill-effects. We don't blame them and make them the problem. That it's very different when you work with people if you help them understand that they are trying to cope with what are unreasonable circumstances as opposed to treating them as if, will somebody else cope with this, you know, maybe, you know, maybe one or two little boys could actually wrestle a wolfhound to the ground, that doesn't mean that other boy's fear of big dogs is unjustified. Often what is empowering and helpful to people is to not feel so crazy. That, that it's not them, that there is something else going on. And also to help expose them to strategies that other people have used to successfully address those, those ill-effects of social inequity. 

00:31:00
  What is the other question (inaudible[00:31:06.14]) for you. 

00:31:05
  I was wondering, I really appreciate your time and seems like I saw a lot of people were nodding as you were speaking and I was wondering how would we share this message to our clients(ph)? It sounds like its (inaudible ) are not as aware of the dynamics of (inaudible ) in therapy. 

00:31:25
BEVERLY GREENE Well, I think we can be more explicit about it in descriptions of our work, you know, when we are, when we are thinking and talking about clients. We need to refrain the way that we do that, so that social inequity is highlighted more as an important contextual element uhm, of whatever is being addressed that may or may not be pathological, but is not simply a function of the individual. Certainly, uhm, I'm not the only person who writes about this, uhm, but writing about it, uhm, I. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
  And teaching. 

00:32:00
BEVERLY GREENE And teaching, duh. 

00:32:05
  Any other questions? 

00:32:10
[sil.] 

00:32:10
  yes? 

00:32:15
  Uhm, you talked about, you talked about the type of disease (inaudible [00:32:27.22]). So given the reality of access to mental care, uhm, be it the management of (inaudible [00:32:37.17]) uhm, how, what are your thoughts about how we use (inaudible[00:32:42.25]) uhm, kind of uhm, access to (inaudible[00:32:48.380])? 

00:32:45
BEVERLY GREENE  Well, I think that there is a way that psychology as a profession has been somewhat asleep at the wheel in terms of addressing mismanaged care before it got to be such a dominant and pervasive reality. Uhm, but I think it's also important not to pretend that what we're doing with managed care has nothing to do with the care and treatment of clients. It has to do with corporate greed and saving money, that money is really the bottom line. And that you can't necessarily do that and, and accept these paradigms, the challenges to be able to work with them and manipulate them, uhm, which you know, I think is gonna be the challenge to future clinicians uhm, you know, as most of us worked in mental health institutions where in many ways, you had to sort of manipulate the, the agenda of the institution, so that you got careful clients, 'cause that wasn't necessarily the agend, the real agenda of the institution. Uhm, managed care entities will have to be manipulated, subverted and undermined as well. 

00:33:55
 And do you know uhm, uhm, I guess ah, the systemic for larger groups about organizing about (inaudible [00:34:06.22]) to the audience that we have today that (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
BEVERLY GREENE Uhm, I don't have the list of them, but they are a range of groups that are, are actively lobbying all the time. Uhm, the other issue has, I think to do with partnerships with consumers that it's, that, you know, professionals don't like mismanaged care, uhm, but consumers are getting screwed, and we need to use our expertise to par, to develop partnerships with them to address that inequity, that it's not just sort of my interest as opposed to their interest, but it is our interest. 

00:34:35
  Okay. We have about 10 minutes left, there's another, yes. 

00:34:40
 Uhm, I would like to just say how do I discuss social inequity if my client does not bring it up herself, and I really appreciate what you said about (inaudible [00:34:55.05]). What would you say about (inaudible ). 

00:35:00
BEVERLY GREENE Well, I'm not a clinician who believes you're not allowed to bring something up because the client didn't bring it up first. Uhm, I, I think that idea has outlived its usefulness. I think it's most effective when you are addressing clinical issues and you are using the client's concern about something to address that issue. Uhm, it should not be your issue. However, this is no different than anything else that comes up in therapy that you know is relevant to a client's life, that they' re choosing not to discuss, or that they're very clearly telling you they don't wanna discuss with you. You know, we don't, we don't go away thinking, "Oh, well, this really has nothing to do with anything", but we try to understand what, what is so painful about discussing it that it needs to be avoided. 

00:35:45
  Okay. Anyone else? 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:50
  All right. Then I wanna thank Dr. Greene for her (inaudible [00:35:59.01]) address. 

00:35:55
