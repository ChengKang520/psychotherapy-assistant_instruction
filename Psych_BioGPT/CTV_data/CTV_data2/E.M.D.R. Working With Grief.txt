BRIEF THERAPY INSIDE OUT with Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling. 

00:01:20
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief Therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus in goal and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited efficient and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy, Each would demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

WORKING WITH GRIEF EMDR FRANCINE SHAPIRO THERAPIST 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON I’m Jon Carlson welcome to Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS And I’m Diane Kjos and this is our guest Francine Shapiro who is going to talk to us about Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing or EMDR. Francine, what… what is Brief Therapy what is that mean? The concept of Brief Therapy. 

00:02:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO, PH.D. EMDR As far as EMDR is concerned it means accelerated processing. It means being able to take a… a therapy process that according to usual types of therapy would go for weeks or months or years and abbreviated to a much shorter period of time, so the research is showing for instances that with the a rape or in a single trauma the therapy for it we generally take only about three sessions. 

00:02:45
JON CARLSON So that will be typical of… of Brief Therapy for you than one to three sessions. 

00:02:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO With EMDR based on a single trauma that’s what it would be. If someone has been molested and has a… has a history… a childhood history then it’s going to take longer so the key for me is not that it has to be very quickly out the door, but rather that you’re looking at the whole comprehensive of picture but with more rapid movement then people would expect in traditional therapy. 

00:03:15
JON CARLSON Well help us understand your strategy of Brief Therapy, just exactly how does EMDR work? 

00:03:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well the concept is that experiences that a person have that were disturbing can get locked in their brain and simply don’t change overtime. There’s a concept that we have within all of us an information processing system that is geared to take disturbance to mental health, so something bothers us and we think about it, talk about it, dream about it times passes and soon it doesn’t bother us any longer we can say it came to an adaptive resolution what’s useful is learnt its stored with appropriate emotion and it can guide us in the future. But what’s useless the negative beliefs and emotion sensation all that is able to be let go but when a trauma occurs whether it’s an obvious trauma like a rape or kidnapping or childhood experiences like a humiliation, it seems to get locked in the system with the perceptions that were there at the time of the event and so if the person goes back to thinking about it even if it happened 40 years ago they will feel their body reacting they might have the same emotions, the same type of thought and that’s just show that its dysfunctionally stored. So with EMDR were accessing that information we’re bringing it up and we are stimulating that inherent information processing system and keeping it active, so that the learning can take place so that it can go to the natural resolution, so that people who have been haunted by experiences from childhood which have left them feeling now I’m not good enough, I can't succeed, I’m not lovable; once that experience is processed its able to take its place in the past and they are able to be released from it really knowing that they are fine, they do deserve love and they can get on with their life. So what we look at in EMDR is the three pronged protocol where we deal with the earlier experiences that set the groundwork for the problem, the present experiences that triggers that bring up the disturbance in the present and what does the person need to learn for more adaptive helpful behavior in the future and we use EMDR for all three of those things. 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON And change would occur really is a learning process in your theory, it's a learning theory? 

00:05:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO That’s right it’s a… its that were catalyzing the learning process and automatically the client is learning what’s useful and able to let go of the rest. So EMDR is not only used for getting rid of major trauma but when we look across pathologies we are saying what’s the experiential contributor. Where did the person learn that they weren’t good enough, that they couldn’t succeed, that they weren’t lovable so we don’t look for instance at idea of personality disorders because that often just chains the client to an immovable mountain rather we are looking at what characteristics does the client have. Whether they are being pushed into doing that they don’t want to do, that’s not helpful for them what are they being prevented from doing that they would like to do and for instance even in with borderline personality disorder we are saying explosive relationships, where was that learnt. Relationship with parent was there a feeling of being abandoned and that’s what gets triggered in the present so that comes out with that type of reactivity so we are looking at this specific events that need to be addressed. 

00:06:35
JON CARLSON It sounds like we have an integrated approach and its sounds like you deal with the past, the present, the future with thinking, feeling and doing. 

00:06:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Right and EMDR is really comp… very complex method it built up around the effect of the eye movement but it brings together all of the different orientations there is aspect of psychodynamic therapy, of behavioral, of systems, of client centered, all of them are integrated in an approach that allows the client to be dealt with as a complete person within an comprehensive clinical picture. 

00:07:05
DIANE KJOS How this all get started and… and how did you… how did you adapt… adapt this approach and… and what influence you to do so. 

00:07:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well it actually started in about 89, or 87 we were walking along one day I was noticing that some disturbing thoughts I was having were suddenly disappearing and when I went to bring them back they just didn’t have the same charge there were in as emotionally valid but I hadn’t done anything deliberately and I knew those were the kind of thoughts that you generally have to engage in to get into to shift but I hadn’t done anything. 

00:07:40
JON CARLSON You couldn’t attribute it to exercise or something like that. 

00:07:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO No, no. 

00:07:45
JON CARLSON I mean… some there’s a theory about that too that if you walk around its therapeutic. 

00:07:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well having walked quite… quite a bit before and having used my mind and body kind of as a… as a laboratory for the previous 10 years. I was intent on finding those things that would assist in alleviating stress and so it grabbed my attention that there was something different about what had happened here so I started paying careful attention and I noticed as I walked along that when that kind of thought came to mind my eyes spontaneously started moving in a certain way very rapidly and I noticed the thought shift and then when I brought it back it just didn’t have the same charge, so at that point I thought I’d stumbled on a natural physiological process that impacted thought so I wanted to see if it would work deliberately. I brought up something that bothered me move my eyes in the same way and found the same thing happened, it shifted and then when I brought it back it just didn’t have the same charge. So I went to experiment on myself and then with other people to see if it would work, so I showed them how my eyes had moved asked them to bring up something disturbing and I found most people don’t have the muscle control to maintain it for any length of time so I started using my fingers to guide them and I saw what I thought was a desensitization process just a lessening of anxiety. It would start and then for most people would stop and then I found I had to evolve a procedure around the effect of the eye movement in order to continue it and then over the past 10 years the method around it has become more elaborate in order to make sure that we were dealing fully with not only the worried well which was I first started experimenting with but across the pathology so at this point we really have a very robust procedure that can have many of the different effects. 

00:09:40
JON CARLSON Can… can you talk about that procedure you know the steps and the stages that are used in EMDR? 

00:09:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well we actually looked at an eight phase model where we are trying to place the therapy within the context of the whole clinical picture so we start out with the first phase being a client history taking is that client appropriate for EMDR at that period of time, so when did they start feeling the way there are feeling exactly what the symptoms are, how long etc and so we want to make sure that EMDR is appropriate for them. 

00:10:10
JON CARLSON What would rule someone out of this stage. Yeah. 

00:10:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well if a person for instance had a dissociative disorder what you would want to make sure is that you use all of the specialty wisdom in working with dissociative disorder first in order to set the groundwork for it before you went in and use the EMDR, because EMDR is a minable to many different applications like substance abuse or dissociative disorder etc but it has to be interconnected with the wisdom that’s available in the field, if the person was suffering solely from an organic problem, if it was a biochemical depression we wouldn’t expect the EMDR to have an effect we’re only talking about applying it to those problems that are experientially based. Well for instance if a child had ADD we might be saying that this is an organic problem but with appropriate diagnosis we wouldn’t use EMDR on the ADD but rather on the failure experiences that the child has had which are contributing more to the problem. 

00:11:15
JON CARLSON Is as per guidance(ph). 

00:11:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Right, so part of the history taking is identifying what the appropriate target need to be, what do we have to process and what do we have to teach the client, because the client has been for instances been molested since childhood and is now 40 years old and the only one she has ever kissed is her father if you just process the earlier memoires it’s not going to make her ready today, we’re going to recognize that a lot of the developmental windows closed in an early age before she learn how to trust herself object constancy how to bond how to make the appropriate connection. So in addition to processing those earlier memories we also make sure what we had to teach the client and use the EMDR for that as well. So the history taking is to get a good comprehensive sense of the picture and then we would be moving into the preparation phase were we teach the client different self control techniques to use metaphors that allow them to witness or experience the emotions and old… old memories as they might emerge while feeling safe in the present. 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON This is preparation for the intervention. 

00:12:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO For the intervention and that also includes therapeutic alliance that the client will feel safe with the clinician be able to tell them the truth of the experiences they don’t have to tell all the details of it because that's, the processing is going on in their head but rather we tell the clinician if it’s getting worse or better or the same, so the clinician knows when they have to might have to intervene more directly and once the preparation phase is completed then we would be going into the assessment phase were we bring together different aspects of the memory, the idea of them being stored memory research says that trauma for instance is stored in fragments. So we bring together image, we bring together the thoughts we’re recognizing… I mean recognizing that there is an alternative to their negative thought, we’re identifying the emotion where they are feeling it in their body and certain scales that let us know a baseline of where we are starting not only for the clinician but for the client as well. So that the client knows that they have spent their time effectively and once we've finished the assessment phase we would go into the processing phases and we call the first one desensitization that we are targeting something and this in memory is the equivalent of a… of a node point so if we are saying that we are bring up a problem that the person has in the present, the reason that’s disturbing its… its… it’s dysfunctional is all of the associations that they have with it all of the connections they have with it so though during the desensitization phase we start with the target which might in certain cases for a person be a rape that happened, but as they process it they may remember other memories that are connected to it, other experiences that happened earlier or later other memories, other emotions other sensations that might emerge and once we have cleaned that all of those different channels we then move to something we call the installation phase where we bring the best positive belief that has emerged from the therapy and we allow that to connect and infuse. So this assists us in maximizing the treatment process, because even if someone has been abused many times during their life you don’t have to treat every memory with EMDR you chose one to represent that whole cluster of events. 

00:14:45
JON CARLSON That’s sort of solution focused at that point in other words you try to install a positive. 

00:14:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well it’s the best belief that has emerged the person might start out feeling I’m guilty I should have done something and they… and they recognize I did fine its… its fine as it is I’m a good person so whatever in the most powerful belief is that spontaneously has emerged for them that’s what gets strengthened and integrated into the other events that might be connected with it so it helps to the… to seems to maximize the effect and then once that stage was complete we have the person bring up the target and scan their body to see if there is any residual tension because that can also be a link into other dysfunctional information that will need to be targeted. Once that’s clear we would be dealing with the closer phase to make sure the client comes back to a sense of equilibrium what to expect in between sessions how to keep a log and then the next session always begins with a revaluation phase we bring up the target we see that the treatment effects are maintained if there’s anything new that needs to be dealt with and the target the… the log that the client keeps and that revaluation phase leads the clinician to whatever the new target need to be. 

00:16:05
DIANE KJOS You talked about concern for say someone whose dissociative are there particular clients you just wouldn’t use this not at all? 

00:16:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well if the client is suffering from something that is purely organic for instance then we wouldn’t be looking at EMDR as having a primary effect. If somebody is suffering from depression that is purely biochemical then drugs would be the treatment of choice. But for many people we find that depression is really caused by earlier life experiences that taught them to believe I’m not good enough I’m worthless, I’m not in control and so EMDR would be useful for those clients and what you are looking for often in the EMDR because you get very rapid treatment affects every often you can separate what's organic from what’s experiential because in that form of depression you might be bringing up these earlier events that taught them that lesson and the reprocessing would be able to see the effects, you would see they don’t need to be stuck on medication for their lifetime, but rather processing those earlier events and the triggers and… and teaching them alternative behaviors can alleviate it. 

00:17:15
JON CARLSON This sounds quite complicated and yet it sounds pretty logical as I as listen to you talk about you know your ideas does it work though I mean is there a research that really supports this. 

00:17:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well at this point the EMDR is more research than any other method used in the treatment of trauma. There are about 12 studies that have been done on EMDR alone, controlled studies and other treatments and trauma at most might have three. At this point the last four studies that have been published have all independently shown that 84 to 100% of single trauma victims no longer had PTSD after the equivalent of only three 90 minutes sessions, so the research is extremely strong for it. 

00:18:05
JON CARLSON Your approach is called in often to disasters or national tragedies? 

00:18:10
DIANE KJOS The bombing in Kansas City or… 

00:18:10
JON CARLSON Oklahoma. 

00:18:10
DIANE KJOS Oklahoma I’m sorry I didn’t get the right state. 

00:18:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well there’s a wide range about of application and when we are dealing with trauma some clinicians then had been trained in critical incident had been able to use it very rapidly after type of… of disaster some working with law enforcement agencies have been able to work with personnel directly after an event and then that goes all the way to being able to use it for the events that have happened like to Vietnam War 30 years ago where people are still suffering and where combat veterans have been long believed to be extremely difficult to treat, resistant to treatment and some of them said you can’t do anything. The most recent study with EMDR showed that after 12 sessions 75% no longer had PTSD so it’s really bringing hope for them as well. 

00:19:00
JON CARLSON So it sounds like you not only have a research base, but you also have a demand that’s coming up from the public who really wants this approach. 

00:19:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well there’s a tremendous a need for trauma treatment throughout the world and one of the things that we are trying to do is have it globally available we’re doing Pro Bono trainings in third worlds and war torn countries because we really believe that pain, biggest(ph) pain and if we can work with victims before they grow up to feel they need to lash out that we really have some hope of ending the cycle of violence within one generation. 

00:19:35
DIANE KJOS In a… in a few minutes we are going to watch you work with someone who has… has lost a loved one and what… what is it… what do you think about before you start or what are you… what are you doing yourself before you start that interview. 

00:19:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well most often we really work with the client we will have them fill out a dissociative experience scale or an impact of event scale in order to see the type of thoughts that might be coming up and so all of that paperwork would have been handled before and I would have the sense of what her… her overall clinical picture but after that its really putting it aside and my goal is to be 100% with the client and let her lead me as to where she needs to go and only allow myself intervene when the processing is stuck, so it’s really making myself a 100% connected and available to the client. 

00:20:30
JON CARLSON As we watch you work with Angie, and the things that the viewer should look for kind of in terms of setting this up in terms of your approach. 

00:20:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well we will be looking at combination first of all that EMDR is structured and there are clinical guides that the clinician has to help them from the beginning to the end of the session but at the same time the importance of being present with the client and being fluid and responsive to their own needs from moment to moment so it’s always dual approach. 

00:21:00
JON CARLSON Okay, so there’s some good helping skills that they’re going to be able to see and then they are going to watch you going back and forth with your hand can you talk about that about the eye movement work that you are doing? 

00:21:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well originally it started out again as I said through the observation of noticing the effect of eye movement and since then we found that we can use hand taps or tones and so we are looking at rhythmical stimulation. Some of the research has shown that after three sessions of EMDR new brain structures come online where Basel Bandicort for instance has shown that after the three sessions of EMDR what comes online is something called the anterior cingulate which is the… what lets the client know they are not in present danger and also the cortex lights up so that they know that they are present and so we see is the difference between being stuck in the emotions and physical sensations and pain of the past and at the end of the session being liberated into the present being connected with their greater sense of what appropriate or what’s right that the learning has taken place on an integrated level. 

00:22:10
JON CARLSON Are there are things that the viewers can see specifically though in the terms of the eye movement in terms of the way it actually you know operates. 

00:22:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well its very interactive they will see what is necessary for the client of long to do it based upon the client’s need in that moment longer perhaps when they are having an emotional response shorter, when it is a cognitive response. There will be different directions of the eye movement depending upon the client’s appropriate need within the moment, but it is overall has to be recognized that this is not going to be training just from this video but it’s going to be important to recognize it is a complex method but they can see it action. 

00:22:55
JON CARLSON Let's watch your work. 

00:22:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

00:22:55
DIANE KJOS Thank you. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I’m… I'm glad to be here. So tell me what is it you’d like to accomplish on the hour? 

00:23:15
My lover passed away in January it was… it was for sure serious meaningful relationship I ever had and her death rocked me a lot, it threw me back in a lot of other ways and I’m coming along with it a lot better than I was even few so weeks ago but I’m still having problems putting it all in perspective. 

00:23:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

00:23:35
And coping with it and some on. 

00:23:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And her name? 

00:23:40
Christine. 

00:23:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Christine okay. So when you’re saying having difficulty putting it in perspective or what’s the problem? 

00:23:55
She was so young and it was unexpected totally it was like everything was going right for once and it was just all gone. You know one minute I’m talking to her on the phone three hours later she was dead. 

00:24:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Wow. 

00:24:15
You know there was just no closure anything else. Lot of it was left inside. 

00:24:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm… hmm. 

00:24:30
So what is you know life is just a big joke what’s the deal why did she die. 

00:24:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Why did she die? 

00:24:35
I have been I’m following back a lot in spiritual practices but sometimes they don’t quite cut it, and I know its lack of faith or I don't know can't figure that. 

00:24:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The pain kind of does push you against that a whole lot and that’s been pretty recent too. So have you… have you felt changing, getting softer a little bit of spirit at time? 

00:25:10
Yeah, its getting used to the whole, it’s gone the whole she left. 

00:25:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm… hmm. So how is it affecting you now from day-to-day what happens different than before. 

00:25:25
I don’t have some of the same confidence I used to have, you know I’m real good at covering it up, faking it and then I can … feel like cocky attitude, but I still kept crying sometimes at night feeling lonely so I think there is… what are the chance that happening again. I mean finding somebody like her you know. I’ve good friends really close friends, but it was on a different level you know. Some people don’t even understand just because you know it was two women you… you don’t get, you know when some bodies spouse dies people will understand that but when you get a female lover she dies, she may had meant the same thing but it's hard to even talk about it with a lot of people. 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:40
I’m getting pissed(ph) because I’ve got to choke of things, I can’t talk about it. I will be open, I want to talk about her. 

00:26:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So what type of thoughts come up about her that you feel you’d like to share, that people don’t like to share. 

00:26:50
Just what a wonderful person she was. She is crazy I mean in granted you know that wasn’t all good, we were bad for each other in a lot of ways we were, that was just a whole another story you know we were both addicts, both trying to recover we would both relapsed together and give and take but she will… she had a good soul… really good soul. 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:25
She should still be here. 

00:27:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So what would… what would you like to accomplish by the end of the hour if we could so that how would you know we were successful. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:50
I can’t make it stop hurting. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:28:00
In a way… I just wish it would stop hurting sometimes. 

00:28:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay or make it softer. 

00:28:05
Yeah. 

00:28:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, okay so you talked about that feeling like there was a whole does that go along with that feeling of pain? 

00:28:20
Yeah. 

00:28:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

00:28:25
When something gets ripped out it hurts. 

00:28:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah… yeah okay you know mourning and grieving is a natural process if some dies but what the mess it can do that I used, it can sometimes help take the knife out of the heart, something just make it softer but it is a natural process to have. So I wouldn’t want you to think that at the end of the hour the goal would be that you wouldn’t miss her, yeah, but if you are up for seeing if we can deal with some of the pain then we could… we could try that. Okay… Okay yeah alright. Sometimes when somebody dies really suddenly the experiences kind of gets locked in the brain and sometimes pictures come up over and over again that cause more of the pain, is it how it’s going on for you. 

00:29:30
Yeah. 

00:29:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay what kind of you are mention one picture that represents that kind of (inaudible ). 

00:29:45
[sil.] 

00:29:50
Just the other day I talk to her, all sitting on the couch listening to CD player and time she set up a bunch of CDs and was hopping through certain songs for me. The last more she said you all we(ph) won me over kind of feeling that song something like that. 

00:30:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So you think of good thing that you have. 

00:30:20
Yeah. 

00:30:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And it makes feelings there okay sometimes there’s also experiences of guilt some type of fights that come up. 

00:30:30
Yeah there is some of those too. It’s the whole drug and thing. I… I should have I mean I encouraged her (inaudible ) I mean I couldn't save myself but it didn’t help. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:30:55
She was so messed up the last time I saw her. 

00:31:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO How did she die? 

00:31:00
It was actually an asthma attack but she had used earlier that day she was on slow speed free. 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And when you think of that how do you feel? 

00:31:30
[sil.] 

00:31:40
I shouldn’t have used with her. You know may be if I hadn’t taken I don’t know she would have. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay do you think that’s part of the pain? Is it okay to work on that? 

00:32:10
Yeah. 

00:32:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay… okay. So the whole thing that we are working here is that you now when you said that you had spiritual helps spiritual practice. 

00:32:30
Yes. 

00:32:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And somehow feels like you’re are not connecting to well. 

00:32:35
I thought I did I know I did I’m just not sure if I’m strong enough to follow my faith my spiritual practices and I mean I know if I do I will be alright. I knew that having a stubborn part of me that just likes to throw it all away and go back to using and just kill the pain because I know it will. 

00:33:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm… hmm. But you know it will just push it down. 

00:33:15
Yeah. 

00:33:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So is it okay to just let it process where it needs to go to. To help get liberated to go where it needs to go without doing you're artificially. 

00:33:35
It will be the best way. 

00:33:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, okay so what we do here is we chose a target to look work on and then what I have you do is think of the target and then I have you follow my fingers with your eyes and that seems to link into a natural process that we have you know you say that when you wake up from sleep sometimes you're crying you know the whole idea of dream sleep people believe there are ways of processing or they just experiences like other times you might have gone to bed feeling upset about something but then you woke up and you felt better about it. That’s the natural process of deep sleep, but when a trauma happens like it just happened with your lover it can locked in the brain and it doesn’t process out during the dream. The dream starts there and then it stops and you wake up in the middle of that. You know they also call dream sleep rapid eye movements sleep. 

00:34:45
Yeah. 

00:34:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And that’s what we think we may be linking into the same processing that goes on during the dream sleep. So after we chose a target I’m going to ask you to follow my fingers with your eyes to make a certain amount of eye movements and then when I ask you, you just let what happened happen while its going on and then we will talk about it. And the talk will do during the session we will target something do your eye movements and then talk about it again. 

00:35:15
Okay. 

00:35:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Alright, so what we want you to do is concentrate on the part that’s making you feel guilty. You are struggling just as much as she was. So part of your brain knows you did the best you could and the other part feels like why didn’t I do more? So that the… the goal is to be able to surrender to it that’s part of the spiritual practice right. 

00:35:45
Yeah. 

00:35:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. Alright okay so you chose a target we are going to start with an image. So I want you to think of what image would represent that feeling of I should have done something. If I hadn’t… if I hadn't used with her she will be okay, you know it might be when you found about it might be the last time you saw her. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:30
Yeah one of the last time I saw her. 

00:36:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

00:36:35
I can’t. 

00:36:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. Then we are going to pick words that described the belief you have about yourself when you think about that image. 

00:36:45
Psychotic. 

00:36:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm. 

00:36:50
Psychotic, stupid. 

00:36:55
That I… I shouldn’t have done it, I shouldn’t have done it. I did something wrong, it my fault. I’ve been negative belief that you can imagine that part of you that’s stored up is saying about yourself, the worst moment work. 

00:37:20
Failure, I failed… I failed her, I guilt me. 

00:37:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I failed her guilt okay. And it’s my fault. Okay now what would you prefer to believe if you connected with this spiritual practice if you’re connected in with that surrender you will go with the belief of that. 

00:37:50
[sil.] 

00:37:55
There’s no blame. 

00:37:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. 

00:38:00
There’s no blame. 

00:38:05
Yeah, recognizing did the best you could that’s okay alright. Then we are going on a judge on a scale where one is completely false and seven is completely true. How true is it feel not with your head say what your gut saying. 

00:38:25
That there is no blame. 

00:38:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm… hmm. 

00:38:30
But true. 

00:38:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO True Okay. Now we are going to start putting the pieces together okay. So holding image in mind and hold that negative belief I failed it’s my fault okay and what emotion comes up. 

00:38:50
[sil.] 

00:38:55
Anger. 

00:38:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Anger, okay. In a scale of 0 to 10 were 0 is neutral and 10 is the worst feeling you can image how does it feel.

FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay and where do you feel it in your body? 

00:39:15

01:11:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO That’s good… that's good. 

01:11:50
It’s like I talk to birds. 

01:11:55
[sil.] 

01:12:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So when you think of the canyon one of the words that says that it should be I’m not blame myself.

01:13:00
Its okay. 

01:13:05
[sil.] 

01:13:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So there would be some more work to do. Just so that you go out. just let whatever happens happen over this next week, it’s like we have opened up some blocks some sound connections (inaudible ) and other thoughts can come up other emotions other memories and it’s just the old stuff its connections being made and so just kind of blizzard is cross by just notice it. What you do is take a good snap shot it so that further work could get done so here’s what it would be. You have one column you just put whatever day it is okay and then sometimes things might happen during the day that would trigger some emotion some disorder just put it down what's the trigger what experiences either really good or really bad. Okay that’s one column you don’t have to write whole book it’s just a book okay then the next one eye for image so what image comes up and it might be in a dream if you wake… if you wake up and remember what it is just jot it down, okay. Then the next is like thought so I put I cognition it just means what way thought what believe might connection came up and again it’s take a quick snap shot and let it go. And then what emotion. Anger, sadness whatever it is just jot down whatever it is. And the last one is an S for sensation what are you feeling. Okay and then a number from 0 to 10 and how high it is. Okay and that just lays it out, so there’s a real pattern, and then the next time the person does this method can just go right in on it and all of this loosening up the stuck places so your connections can get made. And after you’ve done that just put it down and go back to the canyon because that’s where it’s at. Okay. It was really good having you here. 

01:15:35
Thank you very much. 

01:15:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. Thank you. It’s a real pleasure. 

01:15:45
JON CARLSON Let’s take a moment now to take a closer look at this dramatic interview. In this first scene we’re going to see you talking with Angie and having her clarify just what success will look like and then you go on to describes the grieving process. Can you set that up for us about what’s happening here? And what you’re hoping to have occur. 

01:16:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well it’s really important for me to know what her goal is so I can focus on it directly and it’s also important to set her expectations. I don’t want her to feel like she is going to be giving up the memory and that’s often this what caused someone to resist letting go because they think they’re going to be not honoring the dead or forgetting them so part of it to let her know what to expect and to let her know that she will be able to hold on to the connection. 

01:16:40
JON CARLSON Lets watch it. 

01:16:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So what would… what would you like to accomplish by the end of the hour if we could so that how would you we were successful.

01:17:15
In a way I just wish it would stop hurting sometimes. 

01:17:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay or make it softer. 

01:17:20
Yeah. 

01:17:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah okay. So you talked about that feeling like there was a whole does that go along with that feeling of pain? 

01:17:35
Yeah. 

01:17:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

01:17:40
When something gets ripped out it hurts. 

01:17:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah… yeah okay you know mourning and grieving is a natural process if some dies but what the mess it can do that I use it can sometimes help take the knife out of the heart something to make it softer but it is a natural process to have, so I wouldn’t want you to think that at the end of the hour the goal would be that you wouldn’t miss her, yeah, but if you are up for seeing if we can deal with some of the pain then we could… we could try that. Okay… Okay yeah alright. Sometimes when somebody dies really suddenly the experiences kind of gets locked in the brain and sometimes pictures come up over and over again that cause more of the pain, is it how it’s going on for you. 

01:18:45
Yeah. 

01:18:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, what kind of you mention one picture that represents that kind of (inaudible ) come up. 

01:19:00
DIANE KJOS I noticed here that you talk about she talks about getting rid of the pain and you say getting softer. What… what… What’s that? 

01:19:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well it’s trying to make it clear that there are… there are still going to be feelings there that there’s still is going to be the connection there and make sure that the expectations aren’t unrealistic, but that it would get gentler that it’s a normal natural process to grieve after the loss of a loved one but what we are trying to do is make it more bearable and often what happens with the traumatic death something as sudden as this the experience of the times just gets locked in the system and it doesn’t change and what we are trying to do is jump start that natural healing process to allow the grieving to occur so that it can get more gentle it can get softer and it can dissipate over time. Unfortunately the trauma itself often causes pictures to keep emerging and feeling to keep emerging that re-traumatizes the person and sometimes it can get worse rather than the better so what we are looking for is how can we let the natural process to go through this and its leaving her open to the that possibility. 

01:20:15
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:20:15
JON CARLSON In this next segment we’re going to look at you talking about negative thoughts. You talked about that. 

01:20:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well the negative thoughts going along with the imagery and the feelings and the body are really information not stuck and what we are looking at in the EMDR is how do we accesses that network in the brain where this information is stored. So that once the processing can start it moves to appropriate storage where it no longer has the negative affect and the negative beliefs and the negative imagery, so to do that we are first going to target the appropriate one’s that are causing her the most pain. 

01:21:00
JON CARLSON Okay. 

01:21:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And it makes feelings there okay sometimes there’s also experiences of guilt some type of fights that come up. 

01:21:15
Yeah there is some of those too. It’s the whole drug and thing. I… I should have I mean I en… encouraged her (inaudible ) I mean… I couldn't save myself but it didn’t help. She was so messed up the last time I saw her. 

01:21:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO How did she die? 

01:21:45
It was actually an asthma attack but she had used earlier that day she was on slow speed free. 

01:22:00
DIANE KJOS Why you introduce this concept of guilt and she talks about a number of things and you say guilt and what was, is that just because you would expect that at this point and what are you going for here. 

01:22:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well it seems for most trauma victims the first thing that needs to be dealt whose responsibility was it for the event very often just a sense of I should have been able con… to control it I should have been able to do something about it all of the things that weren’t complete that weren’t dealt with all of the things were times weren’t as kind as we now feel we should’ve been that’s what really haunts a person and that’s very, very normal after a tragic and sudden death so I’m just probing to just find out where the tough points might be and by just introducing at an open handed manner were you are not forcing and you are not saying it has to be that way but just leaving it open you can see whether it resonates for the person or not and if it does that’s really an important place to start with. 

01:23:00
JON CARLSON As we move on to another clip you do something powering you talking to her about choosing words and choosing beliefs and then you move on to scaling. Can you talked about that? 

01:23:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO What we are doing is setting up a procedure that brings together the different aspects of the memory and by it starting with the negative, it lets us know with that base line is and then we go to the light at the end of the tunnel. If we are successful what would you like to have and then we’re scaling that in order to see how far we need to go 

01:23:40
JON CARLSON Scaling meaning. 

01:23:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO From one completely false to 7 completely true, how true does it feel so people are coming into therapy because they know they shouldn’t be feeling or believing as bad as they do but that’s what the head is saying we’re looking for the gut response so we don’t know if we’re gotten anywhere unless we know where we started from. 

01:24:00
JON CARLSON Ahh… okay. 

01:24:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So by pulling together the aspects of memory the image the thoughts the emotions were there are feeling it. We’re drawing those aspects together so we are focusing on were its physically stored in the brain and the scales tell us where we are and then we use them generally and to find out what we have accomplished. 

01:24:20
[sil.] 

01:24:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. Then we are going to pick words that described the belief you have about yourself when you think about that image. 

01:24:35
Psychotic. 

01:24:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm. 

01:24:40
Psychotic, stupid. 

01:24:40
That I… I shouldn’t have done it, I shouldn’t have done it. I did something wrong, it my fault. I’ve been negative belief that you can imagine that part of you that’s stored up is saying about yourself, the worst moment work. 

01:25:05
[sil.] 

01:25:10
Failure, I failed… I failed her, I guilt me. 

01:25:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I failed her guilt okay. And it’s my fault. Okay now what would you prefer to believe if you connected in with this spiritual practice if you’re connected in with that surrender you will go with the belief of that. 

01:25:40
[sil.] 

01:25:45
There’s no blame. 

01:25:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. 

01:25:45
There’s no blame. 

01:25:50
[sil.] 

01:25:55
Yeah, recognizing did the best you could that’s okay alright. Then we are going on a judge on a scale where one is completely false and seven is completely true. How true is it feel not with your head say what your gut saying. 

01:26:15
That there is no blame. 

01:26:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm… hmm. 

01:26:20
But true. 

01:26:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO True Okay. Now we are going to start putting the pieces together okay. So holding image in mind and hold that negative belief I failed it’s my fault okay and what emotion comes up. 

01:26:40
sil.] 

01:26:45
Anger. 

01:26:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Anger, okay. In a scale of 0 to 10 were 0 is neutral and 10 is the worst feeling you can image how does it feel. 

01:27:00
8. 

01:27:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay and where do you feel it in your body? 

01:27:00
In the gut. 

01:27:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. So what we are going to do. 

01:27:05
DIANE KJOS what… why do you go, you… I know you’re going to emotions and then you ask her about where did she feel it in her body what that’s all about how does. 

01:27:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well we are talking about the information in the brain is stored and memory researchers talked about the difference between motoric and narrative memory that when a trauma occurs its dysfunctionally stored in motoric memory and that means that is stored with the emotions and the physical sensations that was there where there at that time. So what we’re doing is linking into the body sensation and we’ll find that when something traumatic is not processed they will feel a physical resonance so that’s going to be our guide and then at the end of the session at the end of treatment when we go back to it and she’ll think of it we’d find that there would be no body sensation there, so it’s important for them to connect to where they feel in their body because ultimately no matter what your head says it’s your body that’s going to lead the way. 

01:28:05
DIANE KJOS Okay so you checked out there at the end. The… the other things I was interesting is you are using two scales its… it’s almost little confusing why do you use the two and… and why do you use one that’s a 0 to 7 and one is 0 to 10. 

01:28:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well the 0 to 10 on the emotions based on our what’s called subjective units of disturbance scale developed by Wolpe(ph) for systematic desensitization so it’s basically 0 is common neutral and 10 is the worst, the 1 to 7 scale is what we call the semantic differential so it’s from not true from false to completely true and that’s traditionally an odd number so you can find where the person was. 

01:28:45
DIANE KJOS It’s really two different concepts. 

01:28:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Its two different concepts and two different senses as one in 0 to 10 on the disturbance and the other is 1 to 7 which we would expect to see raise is the treatment how goes on. 

01:28:55
DIANE KJOS So one is the thinking and one is feelings. 

01:28:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO One is feeling. So we will see the sub level go down during treatment and then the VOC goes up. 

01:29:00
JON CARLSON You were really working hard, you were busy writing and taking notes what kinds of things were you putting on the piece of paper. 

01:29:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I was just trying to capture her words which she would, watch were she started which I might go back to remind her where she would like to end up so that at the end of the session generally we will bring her own positive words back and allow that to infuse even more so it’s very important that I remember were… where she was coming from initially and can remind her of different things throughout the session and we’re also trying to get a good scope and a good picture of the information so I would be writing down different protocol steps and for some people new memories of connections that they might be making I’ll write down to see if I want to target them later. 

01:29:50
JON CARLSON Can protocol steps can you highlight those. 

01:29:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well EMDR is an eight phase model so there’s different steps that we have during all of the, of them leads through and this part the procedural elements are going to include the image the negative beliefs the emotions the physical sensation and the different scale and that’s bringing together the different aspects of the memory. If we don’t have the… the image and the negative one connected its equivalent to two laser beams from consciousness to where that information is stored and if you put them together you’re accessing to a greater degree then the person can label the emotions that they have and they can identify the physical sensation. Once we have those then I’ll ask her to bring together the image the negative belief and notice where she is feeling in her body and these three together will accesses that information to the greatest degree and then we’ll start the processing and as the processing occurs you’ll see all of those things moving. The images will change the thoughts will change the physical sensations will change so she already has an idea of what she needs to look for and as we go through the rest of the processing its more fluid she already has an understanding of what it is that is going to be happening. 

01:31:10
JON CARLSON Its seems like this next piece we’re going to see is just an extension of that is. You describes a metaphor of a train and that’s seems to pull all of this together. 

01:31:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well any time someone has posttraumatic stress disorder one of the symptoms one of the manifestations that hold it in place that is… is avoidance behavior as soon as these come up people often try to push it away so what we are trying to do is teach them that it is alright to just notice it and by having a metaphor being on a train it gives them the sense so that there are safe that whatever it is that’s coming up is not going to harm them and they can just notice it pass as scenery it also give the idea of movement that they its going from one place to another and they can just notice it, notice it, notice it, without trying to grab hold of it or making in important or trying to push it away because what we are doing here is stimulating their own inherent healing process and they have been trying to do something about it for such a long time that’s what’s been keeping it stuck so here it’s just notice it, don’t do anything about it and it’s safe to do it and that metaphor often helps people. 

01:32:20
JON CARLSON You know it’s nice placement let’s watch it. 

01:32:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Let it happen and if other stuff comes up just think of it as old stuff, so just coming out and pretend you are on a train and all this is a scenery passing by okay any time you need to stop you just put up your hand and we’ll stop and we’ll talk about it okay. 

01:32:40
Okay. 

01:32:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So we are going to put it together you follow my fingers and just let whatever happens, happen and then I’ll ask you to take a deep breath and let it go and we’ll talk about whatever comes to mind. Okay. 

01:32:55
Hmm. 

01:32:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay alright. 

01:33:00
JON CARLSON In this part was the confirmation necessary to get her confirmation that this was okay. 

01:33:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Right we need to know it’s a co-participation and any one whose suffering from trauma feels lack of control they can feel lack of worth they can feel their just out of faith so besides the metaphor to let her know that’s its safe it’s also important to let her know she can stop because different emotions can come up and we don’t want her to feel like she is being forced to do it or she has no choice, so knowing that she can put her hand up to stop is important and also getting a sense that she understands and then she is signing on for it because unless it’s a co-participation it’s just not going to go anywhere. 

01:33:40
DIANE KJOS So she isn’t traumatized by your treatment in a sense. 

01:33:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO That’s right, that’s right and it’s really important that if she puts her hand up that you stop one a time. Yeah. 

01:33:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:33:50
JON CARLSON In the next segment we’re going to see is perhaps the part that makes us approach most known as the hand movements and finger pushing. Can you describes this process and why it’s used? 

01:34:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well originally it started because I noticed the effect of eye movement on my own thought but when I tried to have people duplicate it I found that most people don’t have the muscle control to maintain it for any length of time and if you think of REM rapid eye movement sleep in dream sleep we know one of the hallmarks of PTSD is that the person wakes up in the middle of the dream so we’re looking at the fact that the disturbance being so great it can inhibit that eye movement. Now there’s a lot of theories as to why it might work but what we are looking at here is allowing bilateral rhythmical movement that keeping the person in the present that’s keep them and also allowing them to concentrate on that material at the same time, so by having her following my fingers with her eyes I’m making sure that she is present with me she is participating with me and at the same time she can notice the material coming up internally without getting overwhelmed by it. 

01:35:05
JON CARLSON So this really isn’t a theatrical plot of any sort this is really rooted in sound fact and theory. 

01:35:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well it started by the observation of the eye movement and then it has evolved into a very complex procedure over these last 10 years so if you took out the eye movement or the other type of stimulation you’d still have a very robust effective procedure but what we’ve seen in different studies is that it appears to allow the processing to go more rapidly and we’d find that there is a distinct advantage to it clinically. 

01:35:35
JON CARLSON Let’s take a close look at it now. 

01:35:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

01:35:40
[sil.] 

01:35:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Good push my finger that's it good blink out deep breath. Good. 

01:36:00
DIANE KJOS And you say push my finger what was that all about. 

01:36:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well again some people will have difficult moving their eyes or they are anticipating it and we want to make sure is that she is staying with me and not getting overwhelmed by material coming in and that she is not stopping the eye movement. So sometimes I… I might say push your… my fingers with your eyes that gives her more of the sense of control that she is able to stay with me more fluidly. For some people they can’t use eye movement at all I might turn to hand taps or tones so it’s a type of stimulation that allows dual awareness of the earlier material and also being safe in the present. 

01:36:40
DIANE KJOS So you can use something other than that the finger movements. 

01:36:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Right unfortunately I named it Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing based on my own observation early on but then when blind people came in for treatment clinicians started to try other things and we found that for many clients we can also use hand taps or tones. So if I had to do it over again I would throw out the eye movement apart it’s a little bit late so we call it EMDR it’s kind of the way ATMT might say American telegraph and telephone and telegraph even though they don’t use telegraphs anymore. 

01:37:20
DIANE KJOS Someone telegraph that one. 

01:37:20
JON CARLSON In this next segment we’re going to watch Angie talking about a prayer stick what the significance of… of that to you. 

01:37:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well it’s really the significance of that it had for her. She had… has a sense of profound spiritual principles and as we saw at the beginning of the tape. We were feeling disconnected from that may be she wasn’t good enough or strong enough to hold on to them 

01:37:45
JON CARLSON Okay. 

01:37:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And what this has done through the processing is she’s gone from the pain and the guilt back into the positive connections and the positive memories and the prayer stick for her and the whole experiences is a… is a complete connection with those… with those spiritual principles so that would become the icon for her. 

01:38:05
JON CARLSON Yeah, it is very, very powerful lets watch it. 

01:38:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Good blink it out. Deep breathe. 

01:38:15
[sil.] 

01:38:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO What are you getting now? 

01:38:20
We were scared of her rashes recently its couple of weeks ago and for her memorial I made her a prayer stick and I used the four secret colors and four raven feathers on it took it from the apple tree in the front yard the branch a piece of home and after the ashes were scattered, it was over look like a canyon, its almost out cropping its middle of nowhere. 

01:38:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm… hmm. 

01:38:55
I sent the prayer stick with her just out it out over the canyon. 

01:39:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Right. 

01:39:00
Then I remember thinking the raven its flying again, she will always fly free a little raven. 

01:39:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Think of that. 

01:39:15
DIANE KJOS So she has a nice metaphor here and one of the things that you do each time we stop is you say what are you thinking or what’s happening now is that sort of to guide you or what… what’s that all about. 

01:39:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well we think of it in terms of memory networks that what we are starting with is the equivalent of a node point a target within a memory network and we have different channels of association different memories that are connected to it image thoughts sounds so as we start the EMDR we’re starting with the target and we are stimulating an internal healing process and as that happens new thoughts and new associations emerge so at the end of each set I’m asking what do get now meaning where are you in that channel, and so it’s where they are in that channel that’s guiding me as to what else I might ask them to bring in or when I might go back to target or when I would be ready to go into the next stage of processing so what we’re doing is as following the natural healing process of the client. We get I get more proactive if she was stuck in any time I might ask different questions or bring different things. 

01:40:30
DIANE KJOS So she kept having the same thing over and over again. 

01:40:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Right if she kept going we’d consider that looping that the new and the appropriate connections are not being made and so that I might ask a question or introduce the thought or any idea in order to make the appropriate connections but as much as possible the clinician and the EMDR stay… stays out of the way so the… the client can go to where they need to go to make the most profound connections for them I couldn’t have brought in the beautiful metaphor for her of a canyon she knew her… in her brain it was in stored and that’s where she went in. 

01:41:05
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:41:05
JON CARLSON In this next segment we’re jump ahead 20 minutes and we’re going to see the canyon again and the raven flying free. Lets watch that. 

01:41:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And what happens when you think of the canyon again. 

01:41:25
[sil.] 

01:41:35
That was just her body on the table. 

01:41:40
[sil.] 

01:41:45
But we left her in the canyon it was still just her body. You know but… 

01:41:55
[sil.] 

01:42:00
She is the little raven flying across that canyon now. Sure is. 

01:42:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. Just think of that. 

01:42:10
JON CARLSON She seemed so relived and the eye movements seemed have changed dramatically, is that usually happen. 

01:42:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well often we’ll see as the processing occurs and as more of the distress peals away the eye movement becomes more fluid. The motions become easier to make and so that’s one of the guides that we are using as we go along. 

01:42:35
JON CARLSON From here you move on to finishing up the interview and you have a log can you talk about the log and how that’s used. 

01:42:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well the log is to help direct the clinical during the revaluation phase because there are eight phases and you always want to make sure that you go back and bring… bring out now. We didn’t complete the processing during this session as a matter of fact when she had been talking about the autopsy and her feelings about body because of the time consciousness of making sure that you always leave a client in better shape than they came in. What I’ve had her do is accesses that the memory of the canyon again so it had a twofold process, it was bring the relief in because that had already been connected with the spiritual principles and it was also reminding her that her lover was not the mutilated body her lover was the spirit flying free so it did a dual role in there and then using the eye movements to enhance that and to make the connection it allowed her the final sense of relief. Generally what I would do in a complete session is I would take an subtle level to make sure it was down to it’s a 0 to 1 and then I would have and made sure that all of the different connections were cleaned out I would have got into then and installation phase where we bring up the best positive belief that had emerged check it, infuse it make it sure was up to a 7 validity of cognition level that it was completely true that it felt completely true we would have done a body scan to make sure that all of the physical sensations were gone and then we would do the closure were we would… we would do the log. What the log does is prepare the client for other processing that might be going on during the week and it gives them a way of looking at it and direct me of the specific patterns so it’s the same type of connections as we ask them to make for the targeting. What’s the triggers that become aware that its cause and effect. There is a certain things that come up that cause them to respond that way they don’t feel as out of control, they recognize that there is something that occurs and then its triggering that the experiences internally, they take snap shot of that then we… we are bring together recognizing that an image comes up that the belief comes up all of those difficult pieces come up or person ends up feeling I am afraid and that’s semantic equation between I and fear its almost their over whelmed by it they define themselves by it and this way they will be able to see the distinct parts there’s an image there’s a thought there’s an emotion there’s a body sensation and this is the level of disturbance so they get to write it down that helps to distance and then they go back to a positive image in order to let it go so in this case she’d be going back to the canyon and able to telling her go. 

01:45:30
DIANE KJOS It seems that it gives her a lot of control to because she now has a way of addressing these things, you… you know systematic way. 

01:45:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Right with the EMDR we bring it’s a very integrated approach and bring together asp… different aspects of different psychotherapies and one of the things we’re looking at is what self control technique can the client have so that they know they can observe the disturbance and then let it go and they have an alternative way to feel. The… the goal in the EMDR is not that they should remember to use a self control technique. The goal of the overall therapy is that those things that were disturbing them are no longer stored that way so they will longer come up but life gets messy and we all need self control techniques sometimes and during the processing phase it’s important that the client know that they can go in and out of disturbance not only in the therapy session but also during the week that follows. 

01:46:30
DIANE KJOS Would you use that then in the following time you met with her? 

01:46:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. 

01:46:35
DIANE KJOS You’d go over that and… and… and how would you use it? 

01:46:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO We would then go over the log and finding out if there are new images that are coming up if there are nightmares, you… you never go on to a new target until the reverberations from the old ones had die out so if she comes and says well I’ve been having or repetitive nightmares she’d have there what’s the image what’s the thought, what’s the emotion and everything would be there or if she said well I kept getting these thoughts and she would describe it and they happened at these different times you'd… you’d have a good pattern you have more comprehensive sense of the… of the clinical picture and from the level of disturbance that she reported or the frequency that she reported the clinician would choice the appropriate target. In this case because we hadn’t completed the processing of this memory of the death we would automatically have to go into the log have her bring up the same target as we use during this session and then see what level of disturbance it was. If there are any new emotions that were there any new perspective and then we would complete the processing with the entire protocol before we go over to something new to the log is a good feedback tool to tell the client the clinician whether the effects were maintained and what new has to be targeted. 

01:47:55
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:47:55
JON CARLSON Thank you very much for giving us insight into your work and allowing us to really process the way we look at the change process.
