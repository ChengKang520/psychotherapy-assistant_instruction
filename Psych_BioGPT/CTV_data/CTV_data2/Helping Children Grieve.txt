Helping Children Grieve 

00:00:20
With Khris Ford and Paula D'Arcy 

00:00:25
JANET AULT Khris Ford and Paula D'Arcy, work with adults and children to help them through their grief after the death of a loved one. Their personal experiences with death give Khris and Paula intimate knowledge and compassion for those experiencing the death of a loved one.

KHRIS FORD My passion for working with grieving children really came from my own experience as a child first umm… who had two siblings who died, uh… and then later in life, umm… after the death of our son, umm… knowing what it was that our daughter who was 11 at the time was struggling with and there were no resources for her. I became determined that umm… there would be resources for families with children, so that not only did the adults get that kind of attention that they needed after a loss, but the children really got what they needed as well.

PAULA D'ARCY I had a brother who was very ill in his infancy and then died at the age of 15. And then when I created my own family, my young husband and almost two year old daughter were killed in a drunk driving accident and I was three months pregnant at the time. So I had a daughter who was born into an atmosphere of grief and loss. It's so important for children to have an adequate opportunity to grieve, because they grow up to be adults. And this is the work of my life seeing people all over the world who have pain that has never been healed. I think of it many times as, like holding a beach ball underwater and you exert tremendous pressure because the ball is buoyant and it wants to rise to the surface and pain over all the years kept underneath the water like that, it takes your energy, it takes in a very subtle way a lot of your focus and it becomes a real grabber of your joy and your happiness.

KHRIS FORD See if you can think of a happy, funny, just a great memory that you have? When we touch children, we really are changing the way people think about and approach this whole process. So that it can be one that's natural, one that leads toward growth rather than uh… paralysis, one that really umm… says to us that grief has the opportunity, it has the potential to change us and to allow us to be more rather than less on the other side. Would you just kind of tell us your name and why you're here and how old you are?

PART 1 

00:04:05
Adults and Children Grieve Differently 

00:04:05
JANET AULT It is important for adults to recognize that adults and children grieve differently. 

00:04:15
KHRIS FORD I think the primary difference between children's grief and adult grief is first that children grieve in little windows of time. It's so important that we allow them to move in and out of it, because their capacity to manage these big emotions is just very limited, unlike adults who might stay very focused on this over a whole weekend during a retreat or a workshop, children just couldn't or wouldn't do that even if I attempted to try to get them to. 

00:04:45
JANET AULT John Schlegel's wife Christina died of breast cancer, his daughter Abby, was two and Emily was four. 

00:04:55
John Schlegel 

00:04:55
JOHN SCHLEGEL When it became obvious to me that she was definitely gonna die umm…I knew that somebody had to let him kind of get, get accustomed to what might be getting ready to happen Abby, my youngest was too small. I mean, she just didn't get anything that was going on. She turned two the day before mom died. But Emily was four at the time and she did get it. You know she was understanding that there was a problem. So I took her to Chick Ville, that was our, that was our place, it's still our place where we have our talks. I said, uh… Emily, you know, what, your mommy is not doing well at all. And she's, you know, God can do a miracle and he can save her life and but, but the deal is, it doesn't look like it's gonna happen. 

00:05:35
JANET AULT Three weeks after John's conversation with Emily, Christina died. 

00:05:40
JOHN SCHLEGEL I took her to, you know, took her to Chick ville uh… I thought I'm not gonna be able to tell her I'm not gonna be able to tell her that mom died. But then everyone else in the family was so upset and I knew it had to be me that told her and I needed to tell her. So umm… She just was numb… She looked at me for a few minutes and then she said, can we get some chicken nuggets? 

00:06:00
JANET AULT Emily is now part of a support group for Grieving Children, where she feels safe to say how she feels . 

00:06:05
KHRIS FORD Do you remember how you felt when daddy told you that? 

00:06:10
EMILY Very sad. 

00:06:15
KHRIS FORD It's very important for them to establish a safe place to retreat to both inside themselves, as well as being able to say I can't talk about this anymore. 

00:06:25
JANET AULT Randy and Cecilia son Collin was diagnosed with diabetes in the eighth grade. When Collin was 18, a series of cascading events led to his death. 

00:06:35
Randy Henderson 

00:06:35
RANDY HENDERSON The first thing, I would just… the insanity of the moment umm… and of course you're so wrapped up in the moment you, you know, there's… The kids are in the room, they're going "Why did I get sent other room? Why is mom and dad screaming?" Unlike mom and dad they, they hardened up I guess would be a good word… You know the emotions got uh… a little… 

00:07:00
Cecilia Henderson 

00:07:00
CECILIA HENDERSON I think to protect themselves they retreated. Children, they don't have the emotional capacity to take all of that in and so umm… they have a tendency to uh… be somewhat neutral. Ian decided that umm… he wanted to make a sword for a (inaudible ) and as he embarked on this project, this huge project of, of taking a machete and turning it into a sword. Ian was having to take all of this angst and this, this feeling of unrest and he, he focused it on this project. 

00:07:35
KHRIS FORD Children often will put their grief on a backburner in a family context, until the adults in the household have begun to kind of come back to some place of balance. And obviously that's because children need the adults in their world to be there for them and they need to know that it is safe. I typically will get a phone call and a mother will say, you know, my husband died three years ago and up until the last six months my kids have just done beautifully. My next question always is, "what happened to you about six months ago?" And typically the response is, "I'm just getting my head above water again." 

00:08:20
PAULA D'ARCY One difference that I see between the way children grieve and adults grieve that, I think is a real positive and can be a model actually for adults, is that children especially younger children, as they go in, in and out are able to go to happy moments even though there's a great sadness in themselves and in the house. And it looks sometimes to adults like wow, that was not a very deep loss to them or they're over it so quickly. But again, it's just this in and out that children do and it's great to support that when you see that in kids. You know, you had a wonderful time at the birthday party today and, and I'm so glad because I think we grow up as adults really believing that there is one emotion that expresses, sort of a tie or you know, a love to the person who has died and we see that as a very painful sadness. And I think kids very naturally realize that you also attached to someone who loved in love.

Salman Al-Alawy, age 17 

00:09:30
SALMAN AL-ALAWY I try and do things that I know that he enjoyed. While he was, he was in the hospital for the last few weeks, he was alive, he watched this movie "Men in Black" over and over and over again. And I watch that movie sometimes, it makes me feel better.

00:09:55
PART 2 

00:09:55
Every Family is Different 

00:10:00
JANET AULT The family system has enormous impact on the way a child grieves. 

00:10:05
PAULA D'ARCY In my own experience I know as, as a young mother just having, given birth but had so much loss, it was enormously difficult to, to be as present as I wanted to be for my child. As she was growing up, there were constant memories that would surface from, when her sibling was that particular age. I use the airline theology as my gold standard. They say, if we have a sudden drop in cabin pressure, a mask will drop from the cap, cabinet above your head, put your own mask on first. There's nothing more vital that any parent or caretaker can do than to do their own grief work, that is the best insurance you have that the child is learning away to grieve. 

00:10:50
KHRIS FORD It is pretty hard when moms are sad, isn't it? 

00:10:55
JEREMY Mom and dad's don't really show because they don't want you to worry until, until they can't really help it. 

00:11:00
KHRIS FORD One of the things that I think I see over and over is fear of crying in front of our children or showing any kind of emotion. And what I always say to parents and what I tried to live out myself, was that, it is important for them to see you cry, if that is an authentic emotion and way of expressing it for you. Because I've had children say to me, mommy never cries and I thought she really love daddy, I wonder why that is. I think it can be rather confusing for children when we don't express authentic emotions in front of them. Do you think when daddy is upset… Is it okay to see him be upset m or would you rather not? 

00:11:45
EMILY Sometimes yes and sometimes no. 

00:11:45
KHRIS FORD So do you think they should cry in front of you and let you know or not? 

00:11:50
JEREMY I think, I think half the time yeah, but half the time no. 

00:11:55
KHRIS FORD Name what's going on, say I am really missing daddy right now or I'm really missing brother right now. And this is what I do to help myself when I feel this way. So that the parent begins to model, that I have to do some things to help myself and then they can have that wonderful teachable moment of saying to their own child, "what do you do when you feel that way? 

00:12:20
JEREMY My mom shows different ways like, if she's like savvies my brother, for like what reason? Because then I know and some… And I ask if I can do something? But sometimes I know that work. So I, so I just don't want to… But I don't like if my mom is sad. 

00:12:40
KHRIS FORD I think one of the most difficult things in grieving families is that, we're all at different places at different times. It's like a merry go round. At once we have the family lifecycle that is moving, at the same time we have these horses that are going up and down and none of the two at the same time and that's the way it is in a household. 

00:13:00
SALMAN AL-ALAWY I think everybody's got something inside of them and that they, none of us have said it yet. And I know something's gonna happen when one of us is gonna explode. I think space between us would help a lot. All of us have been hurt so bad at this point, it's, we just need to take time for ourselves. 

00:13:25
PAULA D'ARCY Grief does not look the same for any two people. So someone's tears are their grief, someone else's activity maybe their grief. And if a family system can find within their circle a deep respect for one another. They not only have a tool that will take them a long way through the grieving time and process, but also something that will serve them really for the rest of their life. 

00:13:55
Cecilia Henderson 

00:13:55
CECILIA HENDERSON You give your children the space to grieve, an opportunity. We even though neither one of the children vocalized a desire to umm… recognize Collins dates of death. Uh… Brandy and I of course needed too. It was important for us and so… Since they didn't have any, any, any tradition they wanted to lay the ground for, any ceremony that they wanted to do. We simply gave them an opportunity to be at his grave side. We made sure that there were opportunities when Randy and I weren't at the grave side. Ian actually through his therapist did told us, that he wanted time alone on the property. We called before we came back to say, you know, is everything okay, is it time for us to comeback, will that be all right for you? And he said, yes, it was. So even though it may not be in the way that you do it, you know, make sure that you open a space. 

00:15:05
KHRIS FORD The other aspect of the family system work that I think is so important is, is this a family where we're gonna talk about the person who died or is this a family where they sort of fell off the face of the earth literally in terms of they never existed? And for some people umm… that is the way in which they manage grief, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the children in the family need that. And so coming to some way of negotiating that, so that everybody gets at least a little bit of what they need. 

00:15:40
JEREMY If it's my mom or dad or like my mom's friend Romano,(ph) who used to take care of Travis. Umm… Like, like, remind me of some most of that he did. He gave like his organs to like, like one to seven year old and he was always a big part of our lives. 

00:16:00
KHRIS FORD I remember a family that we were working with the children and this family took lots of videos in a camcorder and they… I guess the camcorder went everywhere with them. And these children wanted desperately to look at some of these family videos, umm… to see pictures of the brother who had died. However, mom and dad were not in a place where they could manage to see those images. And so they had hidden these videos away. We spent about six months working on a process of negotiating where… Okay, Mom and Dad can't look at them but we can get them out and either bring them to a group to look at or go in a room where mom and dad don't have to see them. So that kind of communication is so important, so everybody gets what they need. 

00:16:50
PART 3 

00:16:50
Parenting Through Grief 

00:16:55
JANET AULT For parents it is important to continue to provide a safe and stable environment for children after the death of a loved one. 

00:17:00
CECILIA HENDERSON See parenting doesn't stop. You still have to parent. You have to parent in your grief and you have to parent a child who is grieving, but you still have to parent, you still have to set boundaries and limitations and know what those are and, and grief can definitely, you know, uh… blind you. 

00:17:20
RANDY HENDERSON One of the byproducts of a disaster like this is, as you rearrange your priorities in life and, and what, what is important sometimes isn't important anymore and what, was it, really is important becomes important. The children are gonna have that same type of apathy. And is this really important? I know I have to do my schoolwork because my, it's required of me, but is it really important that I did this or that? 

00:17:45
CECILIA HENDERSON I had recently had a friend who, uh… her husband died and, and uh… she's very concerned about her daughter's grades. And in the big scheme of things, what is this year going to me, you know? What is, what is happening in this moment? How is that going to reflect on your child's life five years from now? 

00:18:10
JANET AULT There is support available for adults who are grieving. Finding outside help will enable adults in turn to help their children with their grief. 

00:18:20
JOHN SCHLEGEL I don't try to be that guy or that girl that says, I've got it all together, my strength will overcome this. Umm… I've got to be the strong one for my family. Well, that's true, but you can't do it all by yourself. 

00:18:30
PAULA D'ARCY In terms of the process of the family system, I also think it's very important that parents have their own resources for their own grief. There's such a fine line where you want the family to be expressing to one another if they choose, if they can what they feel. But there's an appropriate line that needs to be drawn because sometimes to see the full extent of the upset of your parent is just too destabilizing. It's just too difficult for kids. And I think parents that have their own resources where they can go for those deeper feelings, then I'm better able when they come back to the family system to just report a bad day but not the depth of how they're debating the meaning of life. 

00:19:20
CECILIA HENDERSON In the grief counseling, not only are you receiving umm… information on how to make uh… your day, how to get through three day honestly. But it also allows you to bring things to an individual who is removed from the situation, and say, okay, this, this, this is happening with my child. And they can look at you and say, "calm down, this is perfectly normal, this is typical behavior, or they on the flipside they can say, you know, and then perhaps you need to, to kind of look into that. And having that reassurance of a neutral party, uh… really, really gives you solace. 

00:20:00
KHRIS FORD We're so fortunate today because there are lots of resources for adults in terms of processing their grief and using those resources. For example there are support groups in almost every city across the country. Umm… and I certainly recommend that if you don't know where those are that one good resource in almost every community is to find a hospice and call and ask them if they know about the support groups in your area or call area faith communities. There's online chat groups for people to join. Opportunity, obviously to go see individual therapist, grief therapist, who have particular expertise in the field of grief and loss. There are also workshops and seminars and retreat weekends, so visiting and looking at websites and information about area retreat centers is uh… another resource for people as they are trying to find a way to process their own grief.

PART 4 

00:21:05
Kids Express a Range of Emotions 

00:21:10
[music] 

00:21:15
KHRIS FORD I think one of the misnomers about children in teen grief is that, sadness is the primary feeling for kids when they've had a loss and certainly that is one of the feelings but the primary feeling for children is anxiety. 

00:21:30
SALMAN AL-ALAWY I worried about, like what I was going to do next, 'cause I mean I had always thought, well, what about when I get older and what if I have to take care of my brother, because he's so sick and my mom can't take care of him forever. I worried about what was going to happen to my mom because she took care of him for so long. 

00:21:50
KHRIS FORD We have something new on the wall over here. You see this tree over here? Was that… That's called our worry tree. Well, we have a worry tree up here because, lots of kids tell me that after somebody in their family dies, that they worry about different kinds of things. And so I thought one way for us to get those worries outside of ourselves, picking it out from inside here out to here was, is to say what we're worried about and Miss Paul is gonna write it on a colorful piece of paper. You can even tell her what color you want. And then we're gonna hang it up there on the tree. So does anybody have anything you worried about in the last few weeks? 

00:22:35
EMILY I have a feeling that my sister umm… she will get one time. 

00:22:40
KHRIS FORD Kylie, what do you worry about? 

00:22:45
KYLIE That I might also lose another family member and that I will not know what it feels like when I'm gone from my family. 

00:22:55
JEREMY I worry about that I might lose another family member. 

00:23:00
KHRIS FORD The first question children often ask once they've grasped even a little bit of what has happened is, "who's gonna die next?" Not is, someone is gonna die, but who? 

00:23:10
PAULA D'ARCY I think there's a prevailing question who will take care of me and that's true whether or not it's been a parent who's died because even if it's been a sibling who's died, the parents are not the same. The parents who had are no longer responding and feeling is stable to you as the parents that you now have. And in my own case I was pregnant when my husband was killed. So my daughter was born into a family system that for her was very precarious, all she had was one parent, her sibling had also been killed. And I can remember often sitting down with her over and over again and saying to her, reassuring things like, you know, I take very good care of myself, I watch my nutrition, I get exercise, if I go and you're with a baby sitter, I'm very careful about where I park. And for years I did this and it was just a reassurance that somebody is, is going to be here for you, that you're being left in, in good hands. I mean that anxiety can, can go on literally for years. 

00:24:15
JANET AULT Anxiousness in children may also express itself at school. 

00:24:20
KHRIS FORD When children are trying to be still all day long in a desk and inside their bodies, they just want to come out of their skin. So when I work with teachers I'm always saying, be aware that these are kids who may come across as looking like this label that we often use on children, as if they're ADD or ADHD. When in fact this is about anxiety that is, that is absolutely a normal response. School nurses tell me that they can always tell when there's been something like this happen to a child, because their frequency in the clinic triples. In fact some kids they've never seen before and now they're at the nurse's office constantly because of the physical stuff that goes on for children. And the need to call home because I'm scared that something's happened at home and I'm not there. 

00:25:10
JANET AULT The second large emotion that is common in children after the death of a loved one is feeling different. 

00:25:15
SALMAN AL-ALAWY Most of the people who knew our family, like by really close friends, they knew because umm… just people started telling other people. And, you know, my parents told, our, our family friends I guess and so they knew. But other than that I didn't really tell anybody else. I didn't really want to make like a big deal about it. 

00:25:40
RANDY HENDERSON Ian went through a phase where I think he was the, the, the brother of the boy who died. Uh… and I think Megan may have even had that. So they feel differently and they feel anxious like, everyone knows me because my brother died. 

00:25:55
CECILIA HENDERSON Going back to school was very difficult thing, uh… because they knew that all their classmates knew this is a very intimate thing. It's not often in our lives that uh… something is so cutting, is, is, is displayed in such a public manner and death is one of those things. 

00:26:15
PAULA D'ARCY I was stunned when my daughter was 11 and we moved to a new town to find that she had told all of her new friends that I was divorced. And when I learned this, I questioned her about it and she said, half of my friends have parents that's divorced, no one else has a father who's died. And I saw then the force of that being different. And one of the most valuable things we can do if we can find it, is a peer support group for kids that allows them to be the same as some other kids. 

00:26:50
KHRIS FORD I had a little boy and his mother who were coming to group for the first time, seven year old, and his father had died. They arrived a little bit late. So when I took him down to his group room, I said to the group leader, Janie, your new group, person is here and before I could even finish my sentence, the group of children who were sitting on the floor at the other end of the room, one of the little guys says, "did your daddy die too?" And this little boy looked up at me as if to say, "oh, what's the right answer here?" And I just let him be, didn't respond, and so he very slowly began to nod his head, yes. And just as he began to do that all, of the other little boys who were in this group all went, yes! And of course the group leader looked at me as if to say, "uh… what did I do wrong here?" And in fact, it was so much of what had been done right because those children were saying, "you're like us." 

00:27:50
JANET AULT The third common feeling among children after the death of a loved one is feeling somehow responsible for the death. 

00:27:55
RANDY HENDERSON Meghan had gone to a gymnastics meeting, didn't do as well as she wanted to. And (inaudible ) and normally she loves to go store. She was wrapped up in that moment of self anger, I used a good word for it, and she didn't ask him, she would go with him. And for months she had told me, she asked him and, and he said no. And then finally right before we had the one year anniversary she, she confided me that, that she didn't ask and that she felt incredibly guilty, again responsible for not asking, if she would go to the store with him, that, maybe it would have made some difference. 

00:28:35
PAULA D'ARCY Kids need a lot of opportunity if they do feel responsible for the death. Like, if I had been a better kid, daddy wouldn't have gotten so sick. They need a lot of opportunity just to say that and to say that and to say that again. I think to reassure back, umm… you really weren't responsible, probably goes right through kids ears. I think it's more that they need to say it and to say it and to say it until other things are, you know, are obvious to them. 

00:29:05
KHRIS FORD A story that I remember very well that just uh… really touched me was, a little boy who's in his family, it was ritual tradition that before they went to bed at night that each parent would come and kiss them goodnight and they would have a little bit of a conversation and then they would fall to sleep. And this particular little boy had fallen asleep before daddy got upstairs to kiss him goodnight. And the next morning daddy was killed in an automobile accident on the way to work. And the little boy was convinced that it was because dad was so upset the next morning that he had not been present in his driving and it had an accident. Now we as adults obviously know that wasn't what caused that accident but he was convinced of that. 

00:29:55
JANET AULT Children may also feel guilty after the death of a loved one. 

00:29:55
SALMAN AL-ALAWY I felt really guilty, that my brother had gotten sick and that I didn't… I felt guilty because sometimes or most of the time I felt frustrated with my parents and with him that he was, he was sick. I felt like that I had taken away from me growing up like a normal kid. 

00:30:20
KHRIS FORD And we need to be, offering all kinds of opportunities for them to put this out here, so that we can be responsive and that they can hear themselves over and over and over say, I think it's my fault because… 

00:30:35

00:30:40
PART 5 

00:30:40
Tell the Truth and Be Authentic 

00:30:40
JANET AULT When talking with children about the death of a loved one, adults need to tell them the truth and to be authentic. 

00:30:50
PAULA D'ARCY It's always important to tell the truth. It's always important to be honest you, you measure your language down to the level that they can understand, but you're never trying to say something in a way that softens because they will know that. Kids better than adults know when we're not telling the truth and truth is what they need, that's what makes them feel secure. 

00:31:15
JANET AULT If adults try to shield children from the truth, children may create a reason for how they were responsible for the death of a loved one. 

00:31:20
JOHN SCHLEGEL As much help as we had during the process of Christina dying, umm… there was also a lot of umm… real dysfunction around how the kids were shielded from a lot of the things that, it's, it's just sort of… You know, we don't want to have any pain. And we've already got enough pain, the kids don't need the pain, the kids don't need the exposure. I didn't realize, would have never realized Emily was carrying, it was a sense of responsibility for Christina's death. And I didn't really umm… Again, she was so numb and so unwilling to talk about the issue when I, when I hit it directly, that I just, I never went there. I mean, I went to where she wanted to go and then I stopped. And one of the things we found it through Chris working with her. She said, well, she went to heaven right after she breastfed me. The reason why I believed that, that, that she brought up that particular example, is about two or three years before uh… Christina was diagnosed… I mean, she was 28, 29 years old, uh… we had a scare with, with this also. She had a uh… She had a lump or some sort of uh… thing that should have been there in her breasts and it turns out, when they removed it, it was a, it was just a cyst, it was the good news. Umm… but the other thing was she had some sort of disorder that was causing her to not be able to, to nurse at that time. And we shared that pretty openly and Emily just stored that away. And when it came time to try to connect the dots, she pulled that out of her memory and said, "that's got to be why she got breast cancer."

00:33:05
KHRIS FORD I mentioned earlier that as a child I had some losses and one of those involved the loss of a six week old sibling. Actually at the time of his death, I was not there, I had been sent to my grandmother's umm… because of the fact that my mother had had a very difficult delivery and she just needed some space. However, because his death was such a difficult thing for my parents to manage, when I came back, no one told me where my baby brother was. All I knew is that people in my household were angry and sad. And because I couldn't figure it out, I literally created a memory of how this baby died and I was responsible. I was responsible in my head for this until I was about 40 years old. When my mother and I were sharing about, sort of some timelines in my life and I asked the question, "what about this death?" And she said, "Oh, you remember that?" And I said, I remember it. Of course I remember it, I was responsible." And her mouth flew open and she said, "you weren't even there." 

00:34:20
[music] 

00:34:25
PAULA D'ARCY I think it's pretty universal to, to think that when we don't tell children the truth and include them in the conversations that speak that truth, what they create will almost always be so much worse than whatever truth we think is too difficult for them to handle.

PART 6 

00:34:50
Different Ages Grieve Differently 

00:34:55
JANET AULT Children's understanding of death and the way children carry and express their grief varies according to their age. 

00:35:00
EMILY My mom, when I, I came back from my grandma's umm… she kept us when my mom was sick, so I went and get to see him, (inaudible ). 

00:35:10
KHRIS FORD Children umm… in the preschool age umm… three to fiveish, first of all carry their grief primarily physically, they carried in their bodies. Umm… and their understanding of death per say is very limited, because they don't have an understanding of time, they certainly don't have an understanding of the permanence of death. Umm… what little bit of understanding they have is probably going to come from the sensory understanding of death. So when we talk to a three year old about life, the way they would say they know something's living is by the fact that it talks and eats and umm… sings the things that children think about, that are very sensate. And so the opposite is true when we think about death, that someone who is dead cannot do those very same things. However, for a preschooler that would only be a moment's long. And so it would be like saying to a preschooler, uh… next Saturday we're going to go to Johnny's birthday party. And how many times between now and next Saturday are they going to ask you, "is today the day?" So they're gonna be doing the same thing around death. "Is daddy coming back?" The other aspect of young children is that they have such a limited feeling vocabulary. And so one of the things that we want to help them do, is to have names for feelings that they have. 

00:36:35
PAULA D'ARCY I worked with the family that I thought had a very wonderful way of helping kids identify feelings and be okay with them. And they would put a little chart on the refrigerator every morning and it had lots of different choices on it. Today I'm sad, today I'm mad, today I don't know, I'm confused, I'm angry at the world and they had tiny little magnets and it became routine in that family every morning. People had their own little magnet codes and they would put them somehow on this list and it created a really wonderful opportunity for people to discuss in any way they wanted. Umm… you know, what it was they were feeling, but also for the child to begin to identify, this is the way I'm feeling and it was implicit in that and it's okay to feel that way. And I think sometimes with a more aggressive feelings we have more difficulty with someone's aggressive feelings and grief than we do with their sadness. And with the more aggressive feelings, it becomes really important to teach a way that's safe and that's appropriate to express those feelings. 

00:37:45
KHRIS FORD One of the things we have to be so cautious with, with children this age because they are concrete learners, is the language that we use around death and dying. I remember working with a young child who, umm… daddy had gone in for a very routine operation, the physician surgeon came out and said to the family, umm… looking very sad said, "I'm so sorry but we've lost him." And weeks later that little boy was expressing such frustration and confusion over "why people were so upset, why don't we just go find him?" What we can do to help a three to five year old child is, first of all, they need to be held and touched even more than we would normally do that, because it is such a physical experience for them. It also means that we need to be open to telling that story of the loss, over and over and over because that child's not going to uh… hold it overtime. 

00:38:45
JOHN SCHLEGEL The way that she has dealt with grief, every time it gets hard is, let's talk about our puppy, let's talk about our chicken nuggets. Let's… I mean it's anything but talking about that. My healing places helped a lot with that because even if Emily is kind of a bystander as other people are talking about at times, that are a little bit more ready to share than she is. I think she, she does process that and it means something to her. And slowly but surely she's become a little bit more capable and willing to talk. 

00:39:20
KHRIS FORD When working with elementary school aged children, umm… some of the same things will be true in terms of the younger child not really getting the permanence of death. And so we will need to again repeat that, the story over and over and over as children ask it. And unfortunately this is difficult for parents because when you're hurting, when you're grieving, sometimes parents don't want to tell that story over and over again. So it's helpful that a child have someone else they can go to. The other aspect I think that's important for us to remember with elementary aged kids is that, it is a physical experience and so they need to be able to act, act that out physically. We need to do things that with them that allow them to move around and be physical, so that they can let some of that anxiety that is so prevalent with grieving elementary school aged children umm… and they're able to release that. Even just having crayon and clay and finger-paint and umm… torn paper kinds of things that they can do, so that they really have every opportunity to express it in a way that's comfortable and allows them to really get out what they're trying to express. Also just being able to play it out umm… to be allowed to act out that story in their play and not have someone react in a way of being horrified or feeling terribly sad. So that if they can go into their own play rooms at home and act that out and just simply be observed or validated and that is they're playing. How helpful that would be for children that age? 

00:41:10
[music] 

00:41:15
KHRIS FORD I think when we talk about teenagers I smile because it's a really tough age to nail down and to say, this is what it looks like with a teenager because umm… perhaps more than any other age, there is such a spectrum in terms of what we're going to see. One of the things that I am constantly hearing from parents is, "how do I know what is grief and what is just developmentally happening for my child?" And in the last three to four years, it's become simpler for me to answer that question because I simply say, "we're not gonna know." All of those growth things that are going on for adolescents also involve some loss. And so there's a grief process that's going on there underlying those developmental tasks anyway. So when you overlay that with an experience of loss, we have a big period of time in her life, when it be very hard to tease one out from the other. 

00:42:15
JANET AULT To help determine what is grief or pre-teen or teen and what is developmental, adults need to look at behavior changes. 

00:42:25
CECILIA HENDERSON Ian began withdrawing into his room, which was really a typical for him. We did have a period where he, he turned to try and self medicate. He, he was drinking. When we finally sat down to have a very serious talk with Ian, he said that, it was difficult for him to feel anything. 

00:42:45
SALMAN AL-ALAWY I think it's taken me a long time to be comfortable with the fact that I, I should grieve. Umm… I don't think… I don't know what it looks like yet because I haven't gone through that process of letting myself think through what happened. 

00:43:05
PAULA D'ARCY I think one of the things I'm always aware of with pre-teens and teens when they grieve is that, it's such a period in life where you have such a heightened need for privacy. And then we're worried about them and we want them to be able to express and share these feelings, it's very delicate. And sometimes just a good journal or you know a peer group can be so much more satisfactory for them than to be thinking that they're talking to another adult. 

00:43:40
SALMAN AL-ALAWY It's nice to be able to come and talk to somebody who, who's not going to judge you and not gonna say, "well, you should feel this way and you should feel that way." Umm… I think a lot of my feelings… I mean, I've actually been able to say how I feel. 

00:44:05
PAULA D'ARCY I think also that for teens, it's a time when they're very naturally separating from parents. But if then ahead of that, just very gradual way, a parent is ripped away, this is very devastating. So all of these things make it just a very precarious time, where they probably cannot be loved enough, it's always a delicate balance with teens. What is the space they need to be given, so their privacy is not invaded and then what is the space that we need to create where they feel safe enough to at least express some of the feelings that they're feeling. 

00:44:45
JANET AULT Some children may have a particularly hard time after the death of a loved one. 

00:44:50
PAULA D'ARCY When children are having a particularly difficult time, I think it's always wise to have in the back of our minds, "is this a case where we need to get some professional intervention?" When in doubt I always say, pick up a phone and get that help and ask. But sometimes it's just the throes of where the size of the grief is taking them. One thing that I've seen people do with incredible success, there's nothing like having somebody be a 100% present to you. It may not in all cases be able to be the parent who's able to do this at the time, it's also very interesting how short a time you may need of this, but it's a 100% present. 

00:45:35
JANET AULT Nature and other mediums can be used to help adults be present with their children and help children express what they are feeling. 

00:45:40
PAULA D'ARCY To help a child get out into nature and find, you know, a way they're into that which has so much power in it to express whatever they are feeling inside. I think sometimes is invaluable. Through artwork kids can often paint like a totally black painting and, and let that be okay. And let it be okay that it's a black painting for a month or you know, that it's got a swear word on it or whatever it is that needs to express appropriately the way they're feeling inside. They, they learn from the way we respond to it, that it's okay to have these feelings. 

00:46:25
JOHN SCHLEGEL It's amazing how little kids express things through pictures. And we would talk about pictures that would have mommy in various positions and clouds and all of the stuff. It was real… Every, every little thing had a meaning and so that was very helpful to kind of have these creative tools that I can use at home. Umm… we've, we've instituted things like umm… if she gets really angry… For instance if Emily gets angry, which is one of the way she expresses her grief toward this. She just gets angry and short with people times. We get over and do the hard coloring thing. She takes crayons and just abuses them against her construction paper until she calms down. 

00:47:05
[music] 

00:47:10
PART 7 

00:47:10
Teachers, Coaches, and Friends Can Help 

00:47:15
JANET AULT There are many ways in which teachers, coaches, and friends of the family can help children with their grief. 

00:47:20
SALMAN AL-ALAWY I went right back to school after my brother died. The week after he died I went back to school. Umm… so a lot of my teachers tried to avoid me I guess. It was just umm… I guess a lot of them didn't know how to handle, dealing with it. 

00:47:45
KHRIS FORD One of the things that I think so important for coaches and teachers and so on to know is that, we don't want to make assumptions about what children need. We need to ask kids. So often I've heard a teacher or a coach say, well, they're grieving, so they must want me to not mention the name of that person because that's gonna make him really sad. Well, for one child that might be really true, for another child it's music to their ears to hear that name. 

00:48:10
PAULA D'ARCY I felt when I grieved like I had antenna that said to me, this person will listen to my pain and this person will be a turn away or this person will be or don't feel that way. So a lot of it is just the radar that gets picked up when you know that somebody can do. You really need, which is to listen, listen, listen. It helped my daughter that teachers in the school were aware when events came up like creating crafts for Father's Day. It helps my daughter for me to have gone to those teachers and have said, there's a child in your class that doesn't have a father, so that they could be careful, so that as they approach that day, they could say to the class, we're gonna be making gifts for the men that are really important in our lives and it may be your grandfather, it could be your uncle, it could be, you know, a good friend of your family, you know, your father, I mean those things all helped. And it expressed a sensitivity that said to my daughter, they're not going to make that remark, that's just going to make me want to melt into my chair. 

00:49:20
EMILY My teacher want me get out my folder 

00:49:25
KHRIS FORD Can you tell us about the folder? 

00:49:25
EMILY Umm… it has pictures of (inaudible ), paper to draw pictures in it and as his bookmark and this picture on it. 

00:49:35
KHRIS FORD So you keep that folder in your desk at school, is that what you do? 

00:49:40
EMILY I keep it in my backpack and sometimes I take it out and sometimes just doodle something in there. 

00:49:45
RANDY HENDERSON I think for teachers I think the advice I have is similar parents. Is, is watch for, is, is, is recognition that I think during the grieving period that their energy and their focus may be limited. Uh… they may be half hearted at what they're doing on the social side, are they often alone and so they are interacting with their peers. 

00:50:10
CECILIA HENDERSON Right or has their peer group changed completely? If your child's in a high school of 3,000 kids and all of a sudden their peer group completely shifts. That's something I think the teacher should notify the parent and say, "did you realize?" You know, and may be a completely natural thing to happen, but once again it's a dramatic shift in behavior. 

00:50:30
JANET AULT With the help of the adults in their lives, the journey through grief for a child can be a healing experience. 

00:50:40
KHRIS FORD The first thing I would want us to all remember is that listening and I cannot say that enough is a primary tool that we have, for just being present to children and allowing them to be where they are. Secondly, the truth. Speaking the truth with children at a developmentally appropriate level. So that we don't have children creating and filling in the gaps with images that are usually far worse than the reality. 

00:51:15
PAULA D'ARCY Healing doesn't happen without a place of safety. And for a child, for teens, what creates safety in a home is structure, is stability, is as much consistency as they possibly can be, which is everything from very practical things like nutritious food, keeps getting put on the table. And usually there are so many people that will help you with that. It's consistent bedtimes, it's that the rules still stick. Just because you're grieving, it doesn't mean that you can have any kind of outlandish behavior. And we're gonna say, well, you know, they're grieving, that this container that the home can be, this, this stable steady place. 

00:52:00
JOHN SCHLEGEL They need a hug from somebody else that's been through there and they need to hear that it's okay. You must communicate with your children. You absolutely must communicate with them. And I think that it uh… Creative approach is to do that. If one thing's not working, umm… let it go, don't get frustrated. Umm… come back later, try something else but don't let it go and don't be afraid to keep talking about the loss. 

00:52:25
PAULA D'ARCY There isn't a perfect way to help your family grief. There isn't a way that your child can go through this without cuts and scrapes and, and bruises. It's, it's a wounding experience and then it's part now of their life journey. And so just to relax a bit and to know that we all do essentially the very best we can and it's that, it's that we're trying, it's, it's that we're reaching out to really respect one another and to love through a very difficult time, that in the end I really believe is the final say. 

00:53:05
KHRIS FORD What do kids need when they've had somebody in their family who's died? 

00:53:10
JEREMY When I'm grieving umm… I need… I like, really need like my bear or like, like my mom or dad are always (inaudible ). 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN My mom just comes in there. Sometimes she just sits right beside me and she said, "It's okay, you don't be worried, he's happy right now. 

00:53:30
KHRIS FORD So Emily, do you like people to talk about it or you don't want people to talk about, which? 

00:53:30
EMILY Umm… I do. 

00:53:35
KHRIS FORD How does it help you for people to talk about? 

00:53:35
EMILY It helps me umm… it helps me feel about them more.
