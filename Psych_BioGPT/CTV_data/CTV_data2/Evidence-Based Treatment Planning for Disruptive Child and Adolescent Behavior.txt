UNKNOWN The following is a presentation of John Wiley & Sons. It's part of an informative series about empirically informed treatment planning. This program focuses on disruptive child and adolescent behavior.

Evidence-Based Treatment Planning for Disruptive Child and Adolescent Behavior 

00:00:45
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Hello and welcome. I'm Art Jongsma, and joining me is my colleague Dr. Tim Bruce. Today we're going to discuss with you the empirically formed treatment planning for disruptive child and adolescent behavior. 

00:00:55
Timothy J. Bruce Arthur E. Jongsma, Jr. Ph.D. 

00:00:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE This program is broken into a number of modules. In it we'll define disruptive behavior, discuss the essential elements of the treatment planning process, provide a brief history of the movement to identify empirically supported treatments or ESTs, we'll then show how to empirically inform a treatment plan with findings from the EST literature on disruptive behavior disorders, spend some time discussing common considerations and relapse prevention, and present an example of an evidence based treatment plan for disruptive behavior. 

00:01:30
Modules Define Disruptive Behavior Essential Elements of Treatment Planning Brief History of the EST Movement for ODD/CD Empirically Informing a Treatment Plan Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention Evidence-based Treatment Plan for Disruptive Behavior 

00:01:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Before we get started, one thing should be noted, the purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a treatment plan for disruptive child and adolescent behavior can be empirically informed by incorporating goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with those who've identified ESTs and with evidence based practice guidelines. We'll also see brief scenarios that demonstrate aspects of the EST interventions described. 

00:02:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE It's important to note that these scenarios are selected examples of the ESTs and don't represent the delivery of any one of them in their entirety. Our program's designed to be educational in nature, and is not intended to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about these therapies references to the empirical support, clinical resources, and training opportunities can be found in the companion workbook to this DVD. 

00:02:25
Defining Disruptive Behavior 

00:02:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE We're going to begin by defining what we mean by disruptive behavior. Diagnostically speaking, disruptive behavioral disorders refer to oppositional defiant disorder or ODD, conduct disorder, and disruptive behavior not otherwise specified. Although a disorder also characterized by destructive behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, has been defined separately. For the most part has its own outcome literature, as well as evidence based practice guidelines particular to it. Consistent with this distinction in the literature, we're going to focus on disruptive behavior of the oppositional and conduct type. 

00:03:05
Disruptive Behavioral Disorders: Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) & Conduct Disorder (CD) Attention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 

00:03:05
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Having said that, many of the participants in the treatment studies supporting ESTs for ODD and conduct disorder have multiple comorbidities, including but not limited to ADHD. Although not desirable from a diagnostic clarity perspective, one benefit of this complexity is that it increases confidence that the research participants who have responded to ESTs for disruptive behavior are highly representative of those seen in everyday practice. So lets look at the diagnostic criteria for the two primary disruptive behavior disorders. That will be the focus of this program. 

00:03:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE ODD refers to a pattern of negativistic, hostile, and defiant behavior in persons less than 18 years old that lasts at least six months and during which four or more of the following behaviors are evident. 

00:04:00
Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD): A pattern of negativistic, hostile, and defiant behavior Lasts at least 6 months 

00:04:00
Four (or more) of the behaviors are evident:Often loses temper Often argues with adults Often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults requests or rules Often deliberately annoys people Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior Often touchy or easily annoyed by others Often angry and resentful Often spiteful and vindictive ". . . clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning." 

00:04:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Often loses temper, often argues with adults, often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults requests or rules, often deliberately annoys people, often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior, is often touchy or easily annoyed by others, is often angry and resentful, and is often spiteful and vindictive. The use of the word often in the criteria refers to the requirement that these behaviors occur more frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and developmental level. To meet criteria for ODD the disruptive behavior should cause clinically significantly impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. It's also important to rule out that the disruptive behavior is not occurring exclusively during a psychotic or mood disorder, and it doesn't meet the for conduct disorder. 

00:04:55
Conduct Disorder Pattern of repetitive and persistently defiant behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated Characterized by the presence of three (or more) of the following criteria in the past 12 months (*at least one criterion present in the past 6 months. 

00:04:55
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Conduct disorder is a more serious pattern of repetitive and persistently defiant behaviors in which the basic rights of others or major age appropriate societal norms or rules are violated. It is characterized by the presence of three (or more) of the following criteria in the past 12-months. With at least one criterion present in the past six-months in an individual under the age of 18. Aggression to people and animals. Examples include often bullies, threatens or intimidates others. Often initiates physical fights. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others. For example a bat or a brick or a broken bottle or a knife or gun. Has been physically cruel to people. Has been physically cruel to animals. Has stolen while confronting a victim. For example mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery. Has forced someone into sexual activity. 

00:06:00
Aggression to people and animals Bullies, threatens or intimidates others Often initiates physical fights Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g. a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun Has been physically cruel to people Has been physically cruel to animals Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g. mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery) Has forced someone into sexual activity 

00:06:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The second set of criteria revolves around destruction of property. For example, has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage. Has deliberately destroyed others' property, other than by fire setting. 

00:06:15
Destruction of Property Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage Has deliberately destroyed others' property, other than by fire setting. 

00:06:15
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The third set of conduct disorder criteria has to do with deceitfulness or theft. Some examples include has broken into someone else's house, building or car. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or avoid obligations. That is cons others. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim. For example shop lifting. 

00:06:35
Deceitfulness or Theft Has broken into someone else's house, building or car Often lies to obtain goods or favors to avoid obligations (i.e. "cons" others) Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting, but without breaking and entering; forgery) 

00:06:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. The forth set of conduct disorder criteria center on serious violations of rules. Things like often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions beginning before age 13. Has run away from home overnight at while living in parental or parental surrogate home, or once without returning for a lengthy period. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13. 

00:07:05
Serious Violations of Rules: Often stays our at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age 13 Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in parental or parental surrogate home (or once without returning for a lengthy period) Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 ". . . clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning." 

00:07:05
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. To meet criteria for conduct disorder the disruptive behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. 

00:07:15
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The DSM also has a specifier based on age of onset. Childhood onset type needs at least one criterion characteristic of conduct disorder. Is evident prior to age ten years. Adolescent onset type means there was an absence of any criterion prior to age ten. 

00:07:35
Specify Onset: Childhood-Onset Type Adolescent-Onset 

00:07:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. The severity of conduct disorder is also specified. Mild: few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis and conduct problems cause only minor harm to others. Moderate: number of conduct problems and affect on others intermediate between mild and severe. And severe: many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis or conduct problems cause considerable harm to others. 

00:08:05
Indicate Severity: Mild Moderate Severe 

00:08:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE ODD typically begins before the age of eight, and almost always by early adolescence. Conduct disorder usually occurs before late childhood or early adolescence. It can begin in those as young as five or six years old. ODD has been found to be comorbid with attention deficit hyperactive disorder ADHD in 54 to 67% diagnosed with ADHD. Conduct disorder is a more serious behavioral disorder, and a known precursor to antisocial personality disorder. 

00:08:40
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Having reviewed what constitutes disruptive child and adolescent behavior, we'll now turn to the process of psychotherapy treatment planning, and describe its essential steps. 

00:08:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE There are six essential steps in developing a treatment plan. Each is customized to the individual clients unique presentation. These steps are, identify the clients primary and secondary problems. Describe behavioral definition to the problem, that is each problems behavioral, cognitive, emotional, physical, and interpersonal manifestations. Make a diagnosis based on DSM or ICD criteria. Specify the long term goals of a treatment process. Create short term objectives for the client and select therapeutic interventions. 

00:09:25
Six Steps to a Treatment Plan Identify Primary & Secondary Problems Describe Behavioral Definitions Diagnosis based on DSM/ICD Criteria Specify Long-term Goals Create Short-term Objectives Select Treatment Interventions 

00:09:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. A client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment, but as a first stem in creating a treatment plan the clinician must determine the most significant problem or problems often by assessing which are most related to current distress, disability, or both. Usually a primary problem will surface, and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few identified problems, or treatment will lose its direction. 

00:10:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave, or interact would be to some degree unique to them and their situation. So each problem that is selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how its evidenced in your particular client. Therefore as a second step in the treatment planning process behavioral definition of the problem, that is the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, physical, and interpersonal features of the problem are specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria such as those found in the DSM or ICD, which should be kept in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. 

00:10:50
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. The third step in treatment planning, the determination of an appropriate diagnosis, is based on an evaluation on the clients complete clinical picture. The clinician must compare the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal features causing distress or disability to the criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder as described in the DSM or the ICD. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnosis per se in formulating their treatment programs. But instead they prefer to focus on changes in the identified problem behavior. Cognitions, emotions, and the like. Having said that, most third party payors require a diagnosis and most ESTs are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems. So it's usually necessary to make a diagnosis. 

00:11:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Step four in developing a treatment plan is to set long-term goals for the resolution of the clients primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted in measurable terms, but can be broader and indicate a desired general positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. 

00:12:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Writing short term objectives for the client to achieve is step five in developing a treatment plan. In contrast to long term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measurable or observable terms. Clearly started objectives are helpful to both the therapist and client in assessing progress. They're also important to quality assurance review agencies, health maintenance organizations, and managed care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objectives should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. 

00:12:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Interventions are the actions of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives. Selecting the appropriate therapists interventions is the sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least one intervention planned for every client objective. If the client does not accomplish the objective after the initial interventions have been implimented new interventions should be considered. 

00:13:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. From what we have just described, it may sound like this is a pretty cut and dry process, and that you just simply repeat the process with every client. But that's really not the case. One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client's unique problems, strengths, and needs. Treatment plans should not be boilerplate even if the clients have similar problems. The individual strengths and weaknesses, unique stressers, cultural and social network, family circumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing a treatment strategy. Clinicians should rely on their own good clinical judgment and select interventions that are appropriate for the distinctive individual with whom they're working. 

00:14:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Now that we've discussed the steps involved in treatment planning lets move on to showing how this treatment planning process can be informed by psychotherapy outcome research. We begin by providing a brief overview of the movement to identify empirically supported psychological treatments. 

00:14:25
A Brief History of the Movement to Identify ESTs 

00:14:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Although it can conceivably be argued that the movement to empirically informed psychological treatment began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in the early 1990s in Great Britain and then in the United States. 

00:14:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE On the forefront of the movement the United States was division 12 of the American Psychological Association. 

00:14:55
Division 12 Task Forces: The Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures (original) Task Force on Psychological Interventions (succeeding task force) http://www.psychologicaltreatments.org 

00:14:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The society of clinical psychology. In 1993 Division 12 organized a task force chaired by Dr. Diane Chandlis and charged it with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature. To identify psychological treatments whose efficacy had been demonstrated through clinical research. 

00:15:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. The group established criteria for judging quantity and quality of the research supporting a particular treatment and categorized treatment meeting these criteria as well established or probably efficacious. 

00:15:30
"Well-Established" "Probably Efficacious" 

00:15:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Both sets of criteria required replicated demonstrations of efficacy through high quality trials or case series. The well established category requires independent replications as well as other features. The details of which can be found in the workbook. 

00:15:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE By 1996 the group had identified a preliminary list of 25 ESTs meeting their criteria. By 1998 the list had grown to 71 ESTs. In 1999 division 12 took full ownership maintaining the growing list. 

00:16:00

00:16:05
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Since the work of this original group, other reviewers have emerged using the same or similar criteria to review literature related to these and other populations, problems, and interventions. 

00:16:20

00:16:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. These are some examples 

00:16:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Descriptions of the treatments identified through many of these early reviews as well as references to the empirical work supporting them, clinical resources, and training opportunities can be found at therapy advisor dot com. This resource was developed by personal improvement computer systems with funding from the national institute of mental health and in consultation with the members of the original division 12 cast groups. There are also some organizational efforts to disseminate evidence based medical and or mental health practices or practice guidelines worth noting. 

00:16:55

TIMOTHY J BRUCE The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration or SAMHSA also has an initiative to evaluate, identify, and provide information about evidence based mental heath practices entitled The National Registry of Evidence Based Programs and Practices or NREPP. Their work can also be found online.

TIMOTHY J BRUCE Lastly, working with APA division 12 and the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, APA's division 53 has developed and maintains a compendium of empirically supported treatments for child and adolescent mental disorders. Products of their reviews are available at their website. 

00:18:20

00:18:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. In this series we draw from these and other sources in our discussion of how clinicians can integrate goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with identified ESTs and evidence based practice guidelines. 

00:18:35
Empirically Supported Treatments for Disruptive Child and Adolescent Behavior 

00:18:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Creating an evidence based psychotherapy treatment plan as described in this series involves integrating those aspects of identified ESTs into each step of the treatment planning process discussed previously. Let's briefly look at efforts to develop an identified ESTs and evidence based treatment guidelines for disruptive child and adolescent behavior. 

00:19:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Recent reviews of the treatment outcome literature for disruptive child and adolescent behavior, including ODD and conduct disorder, have identified several empirically supported psychological treatment plans with different levels of empirical support. 

00:19:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Using the original Division 12 criteria, including those for well established and probably efficacious treatments, The Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, APA's division 53, has identified one treatment approach as having met the criteria for well established treatment. 

00:19:35
Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology (APA's Division 53) Available at: http://www.abct.org/sccap/ 

00:19:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. That therapy is Parent Management training or PMT. Also known as behavioral parent training or simply parent training. 

00:19:45

00:19:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Division 53 has also identified numerous therapies currently meeting the criteria for probably efficacious treatments. 

00:19:55

00:19:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE These include parent child interaction therapy, problem solving skills training (also known as cognitive problem solving skills training, anger control training, the rational emotive mental health program, group assertiveness training, multidimensional treatment foster care, and multisystemic therapy. 

00:20:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. The division also lists manualized behavior management programs that have met the probably efficacious criteria. These are helping the noncompliant child, the enhanced version of positive parenting program or triple p, and the incredible years program. 

00:20:35

00:20:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The most recent addition of Nathan & Gorman's A Guide to Treatments that Work, Alan Kazdin, of the Yale Parenting Center and Child Conduct Clinic, reviewed treatments specific to conduct disorder. He identified several therapies that meet the guides criteria for clinical support. The trial used well conducted replicated randomized clinical trials. Many of these therapies overlap with those identified by division 53.

00:21:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE They are, Parent management training, problem solving skills training, anger control training, multidimensional treatment foster care, and multisystemic therapy.

TIMOTHY J BRUCE Evidence based practice guidelines published by NICE in Great Britain which placed emphasis on the highest available level of excellence. Recommend the first line use of parent management training for disruptive child behavior. 

00:21:35
Evidence-based Practice Guidelines for The National Institute for Health and Clinical Services (NICE) First-line option:Parent Management Training (PMT) 

00:21:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Tim, lets take a quick look at some of these empirically supported approaches for child and adolescent behavior. Parent management training uses social learning principles and practices to alter the pattern of interactions between parent and child so that prosocial behavior is positively reinforced and supported within the family system. 

00:21:55
Parent Management Training (PMT) "Uses social learning principles and practices to alter the pattern of interactions between parent and child . . ." "Prosocial behavior is positively reinforced and supported within the family system." 

00:22:00
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Thought therapy parents are taught how to conceptualize, identify, and monitor their child's behavior. How to reinforce social behavior and how to ignore or set limits on problematic behavior. 

00:22:15
Parent Management Training (PMT) "Parents learn how to conceptualize, identify, and monitor their child's behavior. . ." ". . .how to reinforce prosocial behavior, and how to ignore or set limits on problematic behavior." ". . .effective with younger children (typically under 8 years old). . . 

00:22:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Though the course of therapy these skills are refined, reinforced, and generalized. Home visits and school interventions may also be incorporated. Developers of PMT have noted that in general the therapy is proven more effective with younger children, typically under eight years old, than with older children and adolescence. 

00:22:40
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Parent-child interaction therapy, or PCIT works with parents and younger children, typically age two to seven, as it's name suggests PCIT works with parents and children while they interact to improve the quality of the parent-child relationship. Drawing on attachment theory, play therapy, and social learning theory. 

00:23:00
Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) For parents and younger children, typically aged 2 to 7 Works with parents and children while they interact to improve the quality of the parent-child relationship Draws from attachment theory, play therapy, and social learning theory. 

00:23:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE PCIT emphasizes two primary types of interactions. Child directed interaction, in which the parents engage with their children in a play situation that the child directs, and parent directed interaction, which resembles parent management training and the parents are taught how to use specific behavioral management techniques as they play with their children.

00:23:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Problem solving skills training teaches children how to approach conflicts using interpersonal problem solving skills. The therapy employs several techniques such as instruction, modeling, role-playing, feedback, and practice to teach children how to manage interpersonal conflicts. 

00:23:40

00:23:50
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Children are taught how to use a step by step approach to solving problems in an adaptive prosocial manner. The treatment uses structured tasks involving games, stories, and other activities to develop these skills, which are then carried into real life situations. Empirical studies of PSST suggest that it is more effective with older children and adolescents than with younger children.

00:24:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Treatment programs classified under anger control training teach children anger management skills. Such as how to calm one's self and use nonaggresive communication to resolve conflict. As well as using components of parent management training and problem solving skills training. Teacher in service meetings and consultations as well as a video assisted form of role-playing have been used in some recent applications.

00:25:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Group Assertiveness Training is a well known intervention that teaches participants how to communicate their thoughts and feelings in a direct, honest, and constructive manner while respecting rights of others to do the same. Resolution of conflict through assertive communication in the absence of unassertive or aggressive communication is a primary goal of assertiveness applications to anger management.

ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Functional Family Therapy is an integrative family-based therapy that draws from behavioral, cognitive, and system theories. It analyzes problematic interactions based on the function they serve in the family system and for individuals comprising it. The therapy targets change in these interactions to support more adaptive functioning.

00:26:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. The therapy progresses through three general phases. Engagement and motivation, specific behavior change, and generalization. Generalization refers to increasing the family's ability to expand and sustain the changes they made during therapy. Family systems and social learning interventions are largely used to facilitate these changes.

00:27:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The therapist challenges interaction patterns, facilitates development of alternatives that improve communication and then encourages adoption of the alternatives by family members. The development of Brief Strategic Family Therapy is unique in studying cultural futures of families and then integrating those into therapy. The program has been extended to African American families, has been advanced as a model for developing culturally relevant and sensitive treatments.

00:28:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Lastly Multisystemic Therapy was developed to address several limitations of existing mental health service for serious child and adolescent behavior problems, delinquency, and substance abuse. MST conceptualizes youth antisocial behavior as multi-determined and influenced by characteristics of the youth, his or her family, peer group, school, and community contexts. It is a pragmatic and goal oriented treatment that specifically targets those factors in each youth's social network that are contributing to his or her antisocial behavior and/or substance abuse.

00:29:05
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Common objectives for MST include: One,improving caregiver discipline practices, two, enhancing family affective relations, three, decreasing youth association with deviant peers and increasing youth association with prosocial peers, four, improving youth school or vocational performance, five, engaging youth in prosocial recreational outings, and six, developing an indigenous support network of extended family, neighbors, and friends to help caregivers achieve and maintain such changes.

00:29:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Specific treatment techniques used to facilitate these gains include cognitive behavioral, behavioral, and the pragmatic family therapies. MST services are delivered in the natural environment such as the home, school, and community. The treatment plan designed in collaboration with family members and is therefore family-driven rather than therapist driven. The ultimate goal of MST is to empower families to build an environment through the mobilization of indigenous child, family, and community resources that promote health.

00:30:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. As is evident from this review there are not only several approaches to disruptive child and adolescent behavior that have empirical support for their efficacy, there are also some themes apparent in their approaches. These include working with parents or parents and younger children to train parenting skills that promote prosocial behavior and better interactions. Working with older children and adolescents to build adaptive interaction skills such as problem-solving, anger management, and communication skills.

00:31:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE With this information in mind lets look at how a psychotherapy treatment plan can be empirically informed using objectives and interventions consistent with ESTs for disruptive behavior. After determining that disruptive behavior is the primary presenting problem we add to the treatment plan those manifestations of it that the client experiences. 

00:31:35
Integrating the EST for Disruptive Behavior into Treatment Planning 

00:31:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE As is often the case, behavioral definitions often overlap with the diagnostic criteria for the presenting problem, in this case, Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder. Although there is overlap in the definition statements for ODD and CD statements for conduct disorder reflects its more serious psychopathology. These definitions can be edited or additional ones uh, added to best describe the clients particular expression of disruptive behavior. 

00:32:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE You can see from the definition statements listed on the screen, for ODD, that anger issues, arguing with authority figures, blaming others, and abusive language are common features of this diagnosis. 

00:32:15
Examples of Behavioral Definitions for ODD 1. Has a history of explosive outbursts 2. Often argues with authority figures over requests or rules 3. Deliberately annoys people as a means of gaining control 4. Blames others rather than accept responsibility for own problems 5. Displays angry overreaction to perceived disapproval, rejection, or criticism 6. Has persistent pattern of challenging, resenting or disrespecting authority figures 7. Demonstrates body language of tense muscles (e.g. clenched fists or jaw, glaring looks, or refusal to make eye contact) 8. Uses verbally abusive language 9. Abuses substances to cope with feelings of anger and alienation 10. Evidences significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning 

00:32:15
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Although conduct disorder often involves feature that overlap with ODD, such as refusal to comply with rules. It may involve more serious conduct problems such as, fighting, cruelty toward people and/or animals, destruction of property, stealing, truancy, lying, lack of remorse, and even sexual assault. Some children who present with disruptive behavior may not meet full criteria for ODD or conduct disorder. In these cases a diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified may be considered. 

00:32:55
Examples of Behavioral Definitions for CD 1. Persistent refusal to comply with ruses or expectations in the home, school, or community (e.g. breaks curfew, multiple runaways) 2. Excessive fighting, threatening, and intimidation of others, physical cruelty or violence toward people or animals, and destruction of property through fire setting or other ways 3. History of stealing at home, at school, or in the community, including breaking into property 4. Has repeatedly been truant from school 7.Numerous attempts to deceive others through lying, conning, or manipulation 9Verbalizes little or no remorse for misbehavior 11. Has forced someone into sexual activity 

00:32:55
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. The next step in treatment planning is to determine long term goals. Again these are generated collaboratively with the adolescent and/or parents. Examples might include, comply with rules and expectations in the home, school, and community consistently, or express anger in a controlled, respectful manner on a consistent basis. Of course there may be other goals that you may want to develop and add to this list. 

00:33:25
Examples of Long-term Goals: 1. Comply with rules and expectations in the home, school, and community consistently 2. Stop blaming others for problems 3. Express anger in a controlled, respectful manner on a consistent basis 4. Parents learn and implement good child behavioral management skills 5. Parents establish and maintain appropriate parent-child boundaries, setting firm, consistent limits when the client acts out in an aggressive or rebellious manner 6. Reach a level of reduced tension, increased satisfaction, and improved communication with family and/or other authority figures 7. Eliminate all acts of violence or cruelty toward people or animals and stop any destruction of property 9. Demonstrate marked improvement in impulse control 

00:33:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE We now direct our attention to short term objectives and treatment interventions consistent with those of empirically supported treatments for disruptive behavior. As we noted there are numerous ESTs for disruptive behavior. For our purposes of demonstrated evidence based psychotherapy treatment planning, we're going to use an example from the well established Parent Training Treatment, applicable to younger children, and one from a skills building therapy, applicable to older children and adolescents. Before we do that, lets look at objectives and interventions reflective of the assessment stage of therapy. 

00:34:00
Assessment Phase See the Workbook for more complete information 

00:34:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The thorough assessment is common to most forms of therapy as well as ESTs Common objectives and interventions reflective of assessment include, obtaining a thorough understanding of the nature and history of the child's misbehavior as well as assessing any impact of the child's misbehavior on the parenting process. 

00:34:20
Short-Term Objectives 1. Identify major concerns regarding the child's misbehavior and the associated parenting approaches that have been tried. 2. Describe any conflicts that result from the different approaches to parenting that each partner has. 1. Identify major concerns regarding the child's misbehavior and the associated parenting approaches that have been tried. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Conduct a clinical interview focused on specifying the nature, severity, and history of the child's misbehavior. 2. Assess how the parents have attempted to respond to the child's misbehavior and what triggers and reinforcements there may be contributing to the behavior. 1. Assess the parent's consistency in their approach to the child and whether they have experienced conflicts between themselves over how to react to the child. 

00:34:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Psychological tests or objective measures may be used to supplement the clinical interview and track treatment response. Assessment may also involve an evaluation for a need for medications. 

00:34:35
Short-Term Objectives 3. Parents and child cooperation with psychological assessment to further delineate the nature of the problem. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Administer psychological instruments designed to objectively assess parent-child relational conflict (e.g. the Parenting Stress Index [PSI], the Parent-Child Relationship Inventory [PCRI, or Intra and Interpersonal Relationships Scale), traits of oppositional defiance or conduct disorder (e.g. Adolescent Psychopathy Scale-Short Form [APS-SF], Million Adolescent Clinical Inventory [MACI]); give the clients feedback regarding the results of the assessment; re-administer as need to assess outcome. 2. Conduct or arrange for psychological testing to help in assess whether a comorbid condition (e.g. depression, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is contributing to disruptive behavior problems; follow-up accordingly with client and parents regarding treatment options; re-administer as needed to assess outcome. 

00:34:35
Short-Term Objectives 4. Cooperate with an evaluation for possible treatment with psychotropic medications to assist in anger and behavioral control and take medications consistently, if prescribed. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Asses the client for the need for psychotropic medication to assist in control of anger and other misbehaviors; refer him/her to a physician for an evaluation for prescription medication; monitor prescription compliance, effectiveness, and side effects; provide feedback to the prescribing physician. 

00:34:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Empirically supported treatments for disruptive behavior emphasize initial and ongoing psychoeducation. In addition to helping facilitate a client's progress in therapy psychoeducation is also used as a means to reassure, instill hope, motivate, and otherwise enhance the therapeutic relationship. Common themes include conveying a conceptualization of disruptive behavior, describing the treatment approach and its rationale, and enhancing engagement of the client in treatment. 

00:35:10
Psychoeducation See the Workbook for more complete information. 

00:35:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Examples of objectives and interventions from a skills training approach may look like this. 

00:35:15
Short-Term Objectives 5. Verbalize alternative ways to think about and manage anger and behavior associated with it. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assist the client conceptualizing their disruptive behavior as involving different components (cognitive, physiological, affective, and behavioral) that go through predictable phases that can be managed (e.g. demanding expectations not being met leading to increased arousal and anger leading to acting out). 2. Assist the client in identifying the positive consequences of managing anger and misbehavior (e.g., respect from others and self, cooperation from others, improved physical health, etc.); ask the client to agree to learn new ways to conceptualize and manage anger and misbehavior. 

00:35:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Examples from a parent training intervention could look like this, and include assigned readings that supplement in session didactics. 

00:35:25
1. Describe the Parent Management Training approach to teach parents how parent and child behavioral interactions can encourage or discourage positive or negative behavior and that changing key elements of those interactions (e.g., prompting and reinforcing positive behaviors) can be used to promote positive change. 

00:35:25
2. Ask the parents to read material consistent with a parent training approach to managing disruptive behavior (e.g., Parenting through change by Forgach, Living with children by Patterson 

00:35:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. In this vignette the therapist conveys some of the key principles that underpin parent training approaches to managing disruptive behavior. Let's look at that now. 

00:35:40
DAVE Last session we talked about Lou's misbehavior and your frustrations with trying unsuccessfully to get it to change. You talked about the many things that you've tried in the past few months and how it's led to conflict between the two of you as the atmosphere at home has gotten more tense for everyone. 

00:35:55
SUE Yes it has. 

00:36:00
DAVE Raising a child is a challenge for everyone and all parents have times when they want to pull their hair out and scream. So you're in good company. No child comes with an instruction book about how to raise me to become a well behaved child. We all struggle with how to do it. So don't be too hard on yourselves. Someone once said that raising kids is like making waffles. You want to throw away the first one because it's always a mess. Poor Lou is your first one and obviously you don't want to throw him away, but you do want him to obey more often. Right? 

00:36:30
SUE Absolutely. He's been a challenge for us for a long time. But we love him, and we think he's a good kid. 

00:36:35
DAVE Of course he is. I just want you, uh, you to hear that your parenting struggles are normal. I believe I can help you implement some techniques that will help. It will be important for you to work together as a team so there's consistency in your approach to Lou's behavior. Has consistency been an issue between you? 

00:36:50
MARK Yes it has. Sue tends to be harder on him than I am, but she's with him more so she get's frustrated more often too. 

00:37:00
DAVE That's understandable. It's very common for partners to have different ideas about how to deal with child rearing and discipline. A lot of that has to do with how we were raised ourselves. We take that experience into our marriage, and into our new family with our own children. Sometimes we imitate how we were raised, and other times we act, we react against how we were raised. Either way our histories shape our pattern we bring to a new family. It's important now to agree to work together as we institute some new approaches. Can you commit to that? 

00:37:30
MARK It will be good to have some outside ideas to follow. I'm ready. 

00:37:35
SUE Me too. We've been at each others' throats for a long time, but we both know it's best for Lou and the other kids, if we work as a team. 

00:37:40
DAVE Perfect. An important perspective for us to keep is that we want to focus on Lou's behavior in particular situations. Not more generally on him as a child or a person. As you said, Lou is a good child, so we want to help him to adapt some new behaviors in certain situations. A central principle we will be following is that behavior is engaged in by children because it works for them. It gets them what they're after. Whether they themselves realize it or not. We call this the reinforcement principle. Parents provide reinforcement to children's behavior often without being aware of it, and often in subtle ways. Just the day to day interaction in the home sets the stage for the behaviors you are seeing. We're also be shifting the focus from negative behaviors or misbehaviors to prosocial positive or desired behaviors. Simply stated, we want to catch Lou in and the other kids in the family being good, and reward that behavior. Catch them being good is the key concept. 

00:38:40
SUE I try to do that, but it's really hard to stick to it when the misbehavior is so frequent. 

00:38:45
DAVE I definitely understand that. We need to support each other in trying to be consistent in focusing on good behavior, and we will develop ways to do it in a systematic manner by defining exactly what behavior we want to reward. Reward it and then gradually adjust the rewards to, to help the behavior become more established. 

00:39:05
MARK I like that idea. We need to be more consistent in focusing on what we want to see Lou do right. Hand out rewards for it. 

00:39:15
DAVE Exactly right. And after we have established this practice of contingency reinforcement, which is giving rewards based on good behavior, then we'll focus on setting limits on undesirable behavior or enforcing consequences like time out, removal of privileges, or adding home chore assignments. But again, we will need to do this in a systematic manner that specifies exactly what behavior is getting a consequence and what the consequence will be. In fact, we'll write out our plans for rewards and negative consequences. 

00:39:45
SUE This isn't going to be easy, is it? Being so specific about behavior and plans to reward it. 

00:39:50
DAVE No. It takes work. Good communication follow through and consistency on the parental team. 

00:39:55
SUE Well we haven't been consistent I know that. 

00:40:00
DAVE And that again is the norm. One more thing I want to mention, we want to keep in mind that Lou is only eight, so we'll have to tailor our expectations about his behavior to his age and developmental level. 

00:40:10
MARK That's right, I said this to Sue more than once. She expects too much of him at this age. 

00:40:15
SUE And you treat him like he's a baby. 

00:40:15
DAVE There's going to be disagreement about what to expect from him. That's normal and expected too. So we'll have to work together to set expectations for positive behavior that we can agree on and support. Even then we may have to adjust our expectations along the way. We may not get it perfect right away. But I want to get started, I'm going to give you later on some reading material on stages of development and typical behaviors to expect. For now I want to ask you to gather some data by observing Lou and completing this child behavior checklist. 

00:40:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Okay, well first of all, I like this guy's style. 

00:40:55
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Ah, yes. 

00:40:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE You know, I mean, he makes these folks feel comfortable and uh, although he's doing a lot of education, you know, I think he's doing it in a way that helps to engage the parents. 

00:41:05
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. He's relating to them at their level, and I don't think he's talking down to them at all. He tries to normalize the problems that they're having. 

00:41:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of concepts in this vignette that are consistent with you know, kind of the EST approaches. And uh, and one of them that he highlights is the consistency . . . 

00:41:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:41:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE . . .consistency issue between parents in the application of their parenting. 

00:41:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. And the parents acknowledge that they haven't been consistent. . . 

00:41:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Mm-hm. 

00:41:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. . . .that's one of their own problems. And uh . . . 

00:41:30
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Oh, I think everyone struggles with it . . . 

00:41:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:41:30
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah 

00:41:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. That's right, accept you and I of course. 

00:41:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Of course. Another thing I think came through on this is, you know with these kinds of, uh, approaches there's a focus on looking at the child's behavior as approach to look, as opposed that is, to looking at just the child as a whole. 

00:41:45
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:41:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE You know. And that's a, sometimes that's a struggle for people to do. 

00:41:50
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. And another struggle I think is that parents want to focus on controlling the negative. . . 

00:41:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Mm-hm. 

00:41:55
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. . . .and the emphasis has to be on the other side of reinforcing the positive. 

00:42:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah, that's, uh, that, I think that's a critical concept, you know, it's kind of the assumption that the child may not know what to do . . . 

00:42:05
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Mm-hm. 

00:42:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE So when you tell him what not to do they may have nothing else to fall back . . . 

00:42:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Exactly. 

00:42:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE But if you can kind of build and reinforce the positive, you can, you can strengthen the prosocial behavior. 

00:42:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. And Dave points that out nicely to them that it, behavior changes more quickly if you reinforce the positive than if you punish the negative. 

00:42:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Absolutely. 

00:42:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:42:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:42:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:42:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. I also liked that he emphasized appropriate developmental expectations. 

00:42:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yes. 

00:42:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Because you know, depending on the age of the child they're only capable of certain behavior that you can reinforce. 

00:42:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yes. Yeah, and the parent showed their differences in terms of the expectations. They have some conflicts over that issue. 

00:42:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. So a lot of concepts consistent with ESTs. 

00:42:40
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. Good. 

00:42:40
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Having discussed objectives and interventions related to assessment and psychoeducaiton, let's now turn our attention to some of those associated with the treatment and techniques. 

00:42:50
Parent Management Training Objectives See the Workbook for more complete information. 

00:42:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE For parent training objectives and interventions generally reflect the treatments used of social learning principles and practices. Such as specifying problem behaviors, identifying the influences of parental behavior on that of the child. Determining whether the reaction encourages or discourages the behavior, and learning alternatives actions to encourage appropriate change of behavior. 

00:43:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. In parent training there's an emphasis on realistic age-appropriate rules for acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Parents are assisted in pinpointing target behaviors precisely agreeing to work together as a team to ignore misbehavior as much as is practical, and reinforce positive behavior. Sometimes described as catching the child being good. They are directed to implement the reinforcement techniques using clearly established target behaviors and stipulated rewards. Homework assignments are used to guide the process of learning and implementation. In this next vignette the therapist is meeting with parents of an eight year old child with disruptive behaviors. An intervention using parent management techniques is the focus of the session. Let's take a look. 

00:44:00
Short-Term Objectives Parents implement Parent Management Training skills to identify and reinforce the child's behavior. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Teach the parents how to specifically define and identify problem behavior, determine whether the reaction encourages or discourages the behavior, and generate alternatives to the behavior. 2. Assign the parents to implement key parenting practices, including establishing realistic age-appropriate rules for behavior, prompting positive behavior in the environment, use of positive reinforcement to encourage behavior (e.g., praise and clearly established rewards), use of calm clear direct instruction, time out, and other loss-of-privilege practices for sustained problem behavior. 

00:44:05
DAVE Folks let me just start by summarizing where we're at. You started out expressing your concerns and frustrations surrounding Lou's behavior, and then you gathered some observational data about his behavior using the child behavior checklist and the parent daily report that I sent home with you over the last couple of weeks. 

00:44:20
SUE Yes we did. 

00:44:20
MARK Yes we did. 

00:44:20
DAVE From all of that information we have pinpointed two positive behaviors you would like to see from Lou with increased frequency. First, keeping his room tidy, specifically putting his clothes away when he takes them off. Making his bed every morning when he gets up. And secondly sitting at the dinner table and eating with the rest of the family at supper time. Finally you have tracked and charted the frequency of these two behaviors and noted what happened before, during, and after these behaviors occurred. So if quite, we've come quite a long way at this point. Sue is it a fair summary of our work up until today. 

00:45:00
SUE Yes it is. We still haven't made much progress in changing Lou's behavior, and that is frustrating, but we have at least set some clear goals. 

00:45:05
DAVE I hear you about the frustration. To make this work we have to be prepared first, before we start to change the behavior in a systematic way. 

00:45:15
MARK And Lou's wondering what's coming next. He sees us marking things down, but not doing much else. 

00:45:20
DAVE I'll bet he is curious. Our next step is to use some of the rewards that you both listed would hopefully be effective for Lou. We now want to pair the rewards with the two positive behaviors we have pinpointed and measured. Clean room, and eating supper with the family. What rewards do you think that would might be the most effective Mark? 

00:45:35
MARK Well let's see. Here's the list we made a couple of weeks ago. I would say getting his game boy back. Another would be getting a pass to play nine holes of gold, he loves playing golf on that par three close to home. 

00:45:50
DAVE Perfect choices. Good. Now we need to decide how often Lou must do the behavior in weeks time before he gets the reward. Remember I said early that initially at least 75% of the time or the bar is likely to be set too high. What do you think Sue? 

00:46:05
SUE I think we could start at three times a week and see what happens. Can we raise the level expected later? That would be changing the rules. 

00:46:15
DAVE Oh yes. You need to explain to Lou that the expectations may change over time, but that this is where we're starting. 

00:46:20
MARK He won't be very happy about that, but he's not very happy now anyway. 

00:46:25
DAVE He may not, but it's important for him to see that you mean what you say. You can express it to him that you understand that he may not be happy, but that can't change the way that it's going to be. And remember, he may revolt some now, but he sh-, if you stay consistent through that, he's likely to adapt to it. 

00:46:40
SUE I understand, 

00:46:45
DAVE So let's continue to monitor and chart the two behaviors. Remember also that you're not going to get on his case if he does not do these two things. We want to ignore the negative even if it's difficult, and accentuate the positive by rewarding it as we discussed. 

00:47:00
SUE Are we ever going to set limits on him or correct his misbehavior? 

00:47:05
DAVE Yes, you can set limits and have some consequences now if his misbehavior is serious, but ideally we want to hold off on instituting that aspect of parenting. Like using time out, privilege removal, or adding chores until we have a good grasp of rewarding the good behaviors consistently. As much as possible I recommend that you ignore the negative behavior. As I said before, behavior changes much more quickly when positive behavior gets rewarded, or reinforced, than when negative behavior gets punished. 

00:47:35
SUE Okay, at least we are working on something constructive now, and we are doing that together, so that feels good to me. 

00:47:40
DAVE Very good. Now let's review. We have two target behaviors and Lou will get his choice of two rewards if he does either of them three times this week. Does that sound right? 

00:47:50
MARK That works. 

00:47:55
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Well it's obvious again that we are picking this up down the road if he's in parent training. 

00:48:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Mm-hm 

00:48:00
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. It's difficult for parents to learn to pinpoint behaviors, but Dave has shown these people how to do that, and they've begun to collect data on this already. 

00:48:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah, which shows that they're to some degree motivated. 

00:48:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:48:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Because not everyone will do that . . . 

00:48:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. That's right. 

00:48:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE That's a little bit of a screen for who's motivated. 

00:48:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah, that's right. And to see them collecting data, and bring it back into the session, and to be able to understand its importance is a difficult thing for the therapist to do for them. 

00:48:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah, it is. 

00:48:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:48:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE It is. 

00:48:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. And I think you just have to continue to reinforce parents and to explain to them why this particular stage is important, because they get frustrated with the fact that they're not doing more to control behavior. 

00:48:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Right. Right. 

00:48:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. They commented about that themselves. 

00:48:40
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Right. So there's this assessment phase, and they kind of want it to be the treatment phase. 

00:48:40
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yes, that's exactly right. Yes. 

00:48:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah, another thing um, this vignette actually shows kind of one dimension of parent training where you're picking certain behaviors you want the child to do certain chores for example here, or participating in dinner, or something like that. Then deciding what those reinforcements are if they do it at a certain level and another application of parent training that is going to uh, uh, is not seen here, but it's gonna be part of this therapy is teaching them that kind of ongoing, uh, reinforcement . . . 

00:49:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yes. 

00:49:15
TIMOTHY J BRUCE . . .identifying prosocial behavior, knowing when to reinforce that occurs, you know, all day every day. 

00:49:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. You're teaching them to be reinforcers. 

00:49:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:49:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Teaching them to reward positive behavior and have that mindset constantly and between themselves to be consistent that obviously an issue that this couple has and not unusual. 

00:49:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Now one of the ESTs we talked about parent child interaction therapy. It is I think strong in this aspect, because they actually work with the parents and the children in the session. 

00:49:45
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Watching them interact. 

00:49:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Watching them interact, uh, providing feedback, and so on. So I think, you know, um, a very powerful approach to shaping the parents behavior, usually with young children, two to seven years old is where that application's seen. Um, but uh . . . 

00:50:00
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. They can stop the interaction? Say here's what you might try to do, why don't you try to do that. Okay. 

00:50:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. Whereas in PT, although they may sometimes do that, it's often an intervention done with parents that then is . . . 

00:50:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Mm-hm. 

00:50:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE . . .taken and reported back. 

00:50:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. So once again I think Dave is doing a good job here of leading these parents down the road. Giving some psychoeducation, and training them in some very basic techniques. 

00:50:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Our next set of objectives and interventions reflects skills training approaches typically used with older children and adolescents. In this example objectives and interventions consistent with an application of anger control training are used. 

00:50:30
Anger Control Training Objectives and Interventions See Workbook for more complete information. 

00:50:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. An emphasis in these types of interventions is the development of coping skills that help the client identify when they're getting angry, stop the process, and problem solve an adaptive solution. Sometimes referred to as stop, think, and act. This skills set is practiced and refined repeatedly until it becomes the clients consolidated approach to managing frustration and anger. 

00:51:00
Short-Term Objectives 8. Implement Anger Control techniques to manage and control anger Therapeutic Interventions 1. Use modeling, role playing, and behavioral rehearsal to teach the client anger control techniques that include stop, think, and act as well as problem solving skills; role play the application of the skills to multiple situations in the client's life. 2. Assign the client to implement the anger control techniques in his/her daily living; review these incidents; reinforce and provide corrective feedback toward the goal of sustained effective use. 

00:51:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE In this final vignette the therapist works with an older adolescent to help him develop a more adaptive alternative approach to managing conflicts with his parents. 

00:51:10
DAVE Okay Brad, let's look closer at that incident you described when you came home 45-minutes late last night, and it ended up in a blow up with your mom who was waiting up for you? 

00:51:20
BRAD What about it? She acts like she's a cop or something with all her questions. She's always on my case. I was a little late. It's not a big deal. She doesn't have to grill me. 

00:51:25
DAVE It would have been better if it hadn't have been such a big conflict? 

00:51:30
BRAD Yeah, it didn't have to be such a big deal. 

00:51:30
DAVE Well let's look at ways to approach conflicts that might make them less of a big deal in the future. Why don't we try our role playing routine with this situation. You know how it goes. You play mom, and I'll play you. But this time I'm going to try to find a way to respond to that scenario that reduces the chances of it becoming a conflict. What I'm going to do is use the problem solving approach we've been talking about, and you're okay with that? 

00:51:55
BRAD Alright I guess so. 

00:52:00
DAVE Okay. Just to get some understanding of this, I'd like you to pretend that I just walked in and you asked me what your mom asked you when you walked in. What did she say? 

00:52:05
BRAD Where have you been? Why are you so late. You know you're supposed to be home at 11:00. 

00:52:10
DAVE Okay, now this is where you started getting angry? 

00:52:15
BRAD Yeah. 

00:52:15
DAVE Okay, anger is a real feeling, and should be addressed, but instead of increasing the conflict, I'm going to use problem solving, and I'm going to tell you how I'm thinking about it as I do it. 

00:52:25
BRAD Alright. 

00:52:25
DAVE So I want to look at what my options are for a response. I want to stop and think before I act. One way to think about it is like they do on a football or basketball replay on TV, then they say, 'Freeze it right there.' To analyze what happened during a play. 

00:52:40
BRAD Okay, like we did before. 

00:52:45
DAVE Exactly. It's really important that we don't just react quickly to our feelings. We need to take a step back, take a quick time out, and a deep breath, and think about the next step. You can even say to yourself, 'Time out.' Since we talked with your folks about our work on problem solving, you can even say to your mom, 'Let me think about this for a second.' 

00:53:00
BRAD If she would go for that. 

00:53:05
DAVE You might be surprised, and if not, we can deal with that. 

00:53:10
BRAD Alright. 

00:53:10
DAVE Alright, so our next step is to look at the possibilities to responding to this trigger situation. Let's get some out there and then see what, which one looks best. First, you could do what you did, and yell at her about trying to control your life like, 'Can't you just get off my back. You're always trying to control everything I do.' Or you could get angry, ignore her, and walk off to your room. A third is that you could stay calm and tell her exactly what delayed you getting home on time. For example you could say, 'Bill was driving, and he has a later curfew so he blew me off when I said I needed to get home by 11:00. I didn't want to push the issue with him and the other guys there.' Which of those do you think might be a more positive result than what you ended up with last night. 

00:53:50
BRAD Well the last one would be best, and that's exactly what happened, but she doesn't give me a chance to explain. She's firing one question after another at me and I just blew up. 

00:54:00
DAVE I understand. It's important to take control of your ang-, your reactions in these situations. Regardless of what the other person is doing, you have control over your own reactions, but you have to decide to be in control. How do you do this? You stop, take a breath, and think before you act. The results are almost always going to be better. You ask yourself, 'What are my choices?' And then, 'Which choice is going to get the best outcome?' Then chose and act. 

00:54:25
BRAD That's hard for me. 

00:54:30
DAVE I know it is. That's why we're going to practice this problem solving approach over and over in many different situations so it becomes easier and more automatic for you. Let's do the role reversal thing, and have you play yourself and I'll play mom. This time try the third option like I did it. Ready? 

00:54:45
BRAD Okay. 

00:54:45
DAVE Where have you been Brad, why are you so late? You're supposed to be home at 11:00. 

00:54:50
BRAD Can I just have a second to think. 

00:54:50
DAVE Fine. 

00:54:55
BRAD Bill was driving and he doesn't have to be home so early. So when I told him I had to get home by 11:00 he said I had to grow up. I didn't want to push it with and the other guys around. 

00:55:00
DAVE I see. I understand it was hard for you to push it with Bill. I'm glad you tried to get home on time. You do need to figure out how to deal with Bill when he's not allowing you to do what you need to do. 

00:55:10
BRAD He does that sometimes and I don't know what to do. 

00:55:15
DAVE Good Brad. That was great. Good job. You stopped. You thought about your options, you chose a good one, and then you acted. That was excellent. And do you see how the outcome was different? 

00:55:25
BRAD Yeah. I'm not sure my mom would always be that understanding though. 

00:55:30
DAVE Like I said, you might be surprised at the least it seems worth finding out, doesn't it? 

00:55:35
BRAD Yeah. 

00:55:35
DAVE Okay. So that's good for that one. Why don't we switch and take a look at that situation with your teacher that you mentioned before and replay that one the same way. 

00:55:45
BRAD Okay. 

00:55:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Well first of all I like this therapist. I mean he's, he's got a great style . . . 

00:55:50
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Mm-hm. 

00:55:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE . . .and he works very well . . . 

00:55:50
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:55:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE . . .he's engaging this um, this uh, uh, young man, and uh, and not creating a lot of defensiveness and resistance and so on. So I liked that. I think this vignette is a really good demonstration of the application of problem solving to, um, you know, this disruptive behavior. 

00:56:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. And he uses role playing really effectively I think. 

00:56:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Very effectively. 

00:56:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. And he not only does a nice role play, but in the midst of that, and then towards the end he reverses it so that they reverse roles . . . 

00:56:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Mm-hm. 

00:56:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. . . .and have to take on the parent role, and the child role . . . 

00:56:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:56:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. So I think he does that very nicely as a powerful technique to teach . . . 

00:56:30
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah, yeah. 

00:56:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Stop and think. 

00:56:30
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:56:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. And problem solving technique. 

00:56:30
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. It's a common, you know I think that's a common technique used and one of the things it does it can be used to teach empathy so put the client in mom's place, but it can also be used to, to help model uh, wha-, how the client can go about problem solving. 

00:56:50
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Oh. 

00:56:50
TIMOTHY J BRUCE One of the critiques I have of this was when they were doing the problem solving at the stage where they're generating options, the therapist was actually generating the options for . . . 

00:57:00
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yes. 

00:57:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE . . .for the young man. 

00:57:00
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:57:00
TIMOTHY J BRUCE And uh, you know, you'd like to see at some point um, you know, you say uh, you know, what would be another options. Because this allows you to just, you know uh, um, assess how skilled is he? 

00:57:10
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:57:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Does he really know options. 

00:57:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. I'm assuming we're early in the process. 

00:57:15
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Perhaps. 

00:57:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. He needs to get to that . . . 

00:57:15
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:57:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. And that, and that down the road after he's done some modeling of this . . . 

00:57:20
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:57:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Throw it back to the client and let's see if he's picked up . . . 

00:57:25
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yes. Yes. Yes. 

00:57:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. . . . some of that philosophy. Another thing I liked about what Dave did here was to, was to give an example of how to stop action and just brought it back to the sports mentality . . . 

00:57:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Oh yes. Yeah. 

00:57:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. . . .and said, you remember on TV when they stop the . . . 

00:57:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:57:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Action, and they say what's going to happen next . . . 

00:57:35
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:57:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. . . .that's what this kid needs to do is stop. 

00:57:40
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah and this kid, this kid likes sports, and so he . . . 

00:57:40
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. 

00:57:40
TIMOTHY J BRUCE . . .he, it was relevant to what he liked. 

00:57:45
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah, it was good. 

00:57:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE I, I thought all in all it was a re-, a good demonstration of, of the application of problem solving. 

00:57:50
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Yeah. Reviewing the potential reactions that you could put into place here. 

00:57:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:57:55
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. And then picking the one that's best suited. 

00:57:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. And they're going to be doing this over and over and over again. 

00:58:00
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. As therapy goes forward. 

00:58:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:58:05
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Keep applying it to new situations. 

00:58:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Yeah. 

00:58:05
Relapse Prevention. 

00:58:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Whether treated pharmacologically, psychologically, or both destructive behavior such as that scene in ODD and conduct disorder can relapse. Let's take a look at some common considerations in relapse prevention, and how they can be incorporated into your treatment plan. 

00:58:20
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. One of the first steps in relapse prevention interventions is to provide a rationale for them. This typically involves a discussion of the risk for relapse and how using the relapse prevention approach we will outline can lower that risk. 

00:58:35
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention: 1. Explain the rationale of relapse prevention interventions 

00:58:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this one. 

00:58:45
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention that discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 2. Discuss between the parent/child the distinction between a lapse and relapse associating a lapse with a temporary 

00:58:45
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Another initial step in relapse prevention is to distinguish between a lapse and relapse. A lapse as presented as a temporary setback that may invlove, for example, a behavioral infraction on the child's part. A slip back into an old maladaptive parenting habit, or an initial return of any disruptive behavior. Relapse on the other hand is described as a more sustained pattern of disruptive behavior characteristic of ODD and Conduct Disorder. 

00:59:10
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention: 1. Explain the rationale of relapse prevention interventions 2. Distinguish between lapse and relapse 

00:59:10
TIMOTHY J BRUCE The rationale for this distinction is that lapses do not need to develop into a relapse if they can be caught and managed. This component of relapse prevention can be captured in the therapist intervention such as this one. 

00:59:25
introduces strategies for preventing it. 2. Discuss with the parent/child distinctions between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with a temporary setback and relapse with a return to a sustained pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving that is characteristic of ODD/CD. 3. Identify and rehearse with the 

00:59:25
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Accordingly high risk situations that might make the child or parents vulnerable to lapse are identified. This discussion may be informed by past difficult experiences or anticipated new ones. 

00:59:40
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention: 1. Explain the rationale of relapse prevention interventions 2. Distinguish between lapse and relapse 3. Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse 4. Review the application of skills learned in therapy to high-risk situations 

00:59:40
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Some examples might include, when parents are busy. Stressed at work or have unusually high demands on them. When the parent and child have a conflict that is not immediately resolved. When peer pressure is placed on the child to behave disruptively. 

00:59:55
TIMOTHY J BRUCE For the high risk situation identified the therapist leads the client in a rehearsal in using skills learned in therapy to manage them. Including the skill of developing a tolerance for the lapse, while working on how to problem solve it.

01:00:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. In addition to using skills learned in therapy to manage high risk situations, parents and children are also encouraged to use strategies learned in therapy during their day to day life.

01:00:30
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Examples include encouraging the consistent use of parent training, problem solving, assertive communication, anger management, and conflict resolution techniques. Therapist intervention number four captures this intervention in the treatment plan. Sometimes parents or children benefit from having a coping card or other reminders of important strategies and information regarding relapse prevention. If you decide to use this aid, it can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as number five. 

01:01:05
lapses could occur. 4. Instruct the parent/child to routinely use strategies learned int therapy (e.g., parent training techniques, problem-solving, anger management), building them into his/her life as much as possible. 5. Develop a "coping card" on which coping strategies and other important information can be kept (e.g., steps in problem-solving, positive coping statements, reminders that were helpful to the client during therapy). 6. Schedule periodic maintenance or "booster" sessions to help the 

01:01:05
TIMOTHY J BRUCE Finally periodic booster sessions of therapy can help reinforce positive changes, problem solve challenges, and facilitate continued improvement. So clients are invited to periodically visit therapy for these purposes.

01:01:35
Short-Term Objectives Learn and implement strategies to prevent relapse of disruptive behavior. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention that discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 2.

01:01:35
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. On your screen now appears an example of a final treatment plan that incorporates all of the steps of the evidences based psychotherapy treatment planning that we've presented in this program. It includes the primary problem, the behavioral definitions of the problem applicable to your client, the diagnosis or diagnoses, the long term goal or goals of treatment, and the short term client objectives and related therapist interventions consistent with those of empirically supported treatments. 

01:02:15
Primary Problem: Oppositional Defiant Behavior Behavioral Definition 1. Has a history of explosive, aggressive outbursts. 2. Often argues with authority figures over requests or rules. 3. Blames others rather than accept responsibility for own problems. 4. Displays angry overreaction to perceived disapproval, rejection, or criticism. 5. Has persistent pattern of challenging, resenting or disrespecting authority figures. 6. Uses verbally abusive language. 7. Evidences significant impairment in social and academic functioning. Diagnosis: Oppositional Defiant Disorder (313.81) Long Term Goals: 1. Comply consistently with rules and expectations in the home and school. 2. Stop blaming others for problems and accept responsibility for own feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. 3. Express anger in a controlled, respectful manner on a consistent basis. 4. Parents learn and implement effective child behavioral management skills. 5. Reach a level of reduced tension, increased satisfaction, and improved communication with family. Short-Term Objectives 1. Identify major concerns regarding the child's misbehavior and the associated parenting approaches that have been tried. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Conduct a clinical interview focused on specifying the nature, severity, and history of the child's misbehavior. 2. Assess how the parents have attempted to respond to the child's misbehavior and what triggers and reinforcements there may be contributing to the behavior. 

01:02:15
ARTHUR E. JONGSMA, JR. Including those related to assessment, initial and ongoing psychoeducation, parent management training, anger control training with an emphasis on problem solving skills, and relapse prevention. 

01:02:35
Short-Term Objectives 4. Cooperate with an evaluation for possible treatment with psychotropic medications to assist in anger and behavioral control and take medications consistently, if prescribed. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Asses the client for the need for psychotropic medication to assist in control of anger and other misbehaviors; refer him/her to a physician for an evaluation for prescription medication; monitor prescription compliance, effectiveness, and side effects; provide feedback to the prescribing physician. 

01:02:35

TIMOTHY J BRUCE As much and previously the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of evidence based psychotherapy treatment plan for common mental health problems. It's designed to be informative in nature, and does not intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about empirically supported treatments, references to the empirically support, clinical training materials, and training opportunities are provided in the companion book to this DVD.
