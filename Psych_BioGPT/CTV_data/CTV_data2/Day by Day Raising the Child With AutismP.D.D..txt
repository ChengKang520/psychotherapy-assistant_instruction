00:00:45

00:01:00
Unrelated 

00:01:05

00:01:10

“JESSICA” Raising A Child With Autism And Attention Deficit Disorder The Disability 

00:01:35
ROB I noticed from birth she was very unique individual and that she seemed like she was an independent person even from birth it seem like she had her world that she was in. She only needed us as demand for or whatever she couldn't do herself. 

00:01:55
[sil.] 

00:02:00
IRENE She never put her arms up to me to take her out of the crib. She didn’t care whether mom and dad where there. 

00:02:05
(inaudible ) Christmas trees, Jessica you don't want to walk ah… 

00:02:10
IRENE She was the most active child that we knew. She was definitely different than our friend's children. Ah…she walked earlier, crawled earlier did all major things earlier. But we didn’t have that give and take. We had suspected that Jessica was autistic or autistic like probably from the time she was 15 months on. It just took us about six months to get the doctors to agree. What is that What is that open it up. Please close the bag. 

00:02:50
[sil.] 

00:02:55
IRENE When we got the diagnosis two things became apparent, one that they didn’t know what caused the autism and so therefore you know we could possibly have another child with that disability and then the other thing was this child was going to need a lot of attention, much more than an average child would. You like that. you like that. 

00:03:20
The Symptoms 

00:03:25
IRENE I can remember before we had a diagnosis thinking she was the more strong-willed child. 

00:03:30
Four Years Old 

00:03:30
IRENE Go and get some soda. Jessica, Jessica you need to sit. Then I remember getting a diagnosis and feeling so extremely sad. I realized that she didn’t understand what was really going on and it was that level of misunderstanding or frustration, lack of communication and that was at the rude(ph) of what that issue was and not that she was a stubborn, undisciplined child. 

00:04:05
ROB The knowledge or lack of knowledge of, of when her, when is her… her strong will defiance or just her autism. Ah… it goes through stages as well there are times where we can expect her to sit in chair and she does very well at for a period of time. And she go through a period of time where she just can't do it. I guess another… another example of times when you just can't understand what the problem is or whether it's her versus her something she can control would be in her nighttime sleeping habits or sleeping habits are extremely unpredictable. She may come into our bedroom and wanna lay in bed with us and she starts kicking on us and pushing us like she wants us out of bed. We get out of bed she wants us back in bed. She was back and forth, we'll carry into her bed, she goes crazy. She doesn't want to be in her bed, we don’t know. What it is that she wants. 

00:05:05
IRENE Jessica please. Just recently I took her to the grocery store. 

00:05:05
Behavior in Public 

00:05:10
IRENE And things have been going so well that I went to the grocery store after supper, which I would have never done in the past. Oh you want the computer that’s not a toy. Would you like to walk? Would you like to walk? Oh that was a mistake. When she asked me to get out of the cart and it's almost time to leave you know I want to try new things and may be this is the time that she is going to be able to push the cart and leave the store with mommy. Ah…but you know sometimes you know you cannot always anticipate what’s going to happen. No…no…you cannot have the computer stop…stop. 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:00
IRENE I know it's hard. I know…. Jessica gets so stimulated by certain experiences and she is running around the store. I'm getting exhausted. I mean sometimes I feel like I did a day's work just chasing her at the store and I get mad sometimes too that I have to go through this just to get pair of shoes. Do you like this Jess? Do you like them? Things like getting her hair cut in the past was so…so difficult and even today I still wouldn't take her into to the hair salon or the you know out of the store to do that we still have a friend come and do it. 

00:06:45
I don’t want to poke your mom's eyes out you know… 

00:06:45
IRENE Let's count, let's count I gotta sit. Now listen you can sit down or I will have to hold you. 

00:06:55
JESSICA Please. 

00:06:55
IRENE Please. 

00:06:55
Hyperactivity 

00:07:00
ROB We would like her to sit down at dinner and She'd still… so we can relax a little bit at that time of the day with the medicine wearing off and just being overactive. She’s jumping up and down out of the chair so that disrupts our dinner. Jessica since she has done her dinner wants to run and rush off to do something else. 

00:07:20
IRENE Are you finished? 

00:07:25
Anger 

00:07:25
ROB Don't you dare throw, let's go. The biggest part for me I think is her rage and anger that gets out of control and you just don’t know what to do for her. She doesn’t communicate to us, what it is…what’s she angry about. When she has a tantrum or loses it. It's… it's…depressing to see her like that… 

00:07:50
IRENE Your mom is sick too. It doesn't fit. If she has a new toy and she can’t get it to fit or she can’t get it to do what she wanted to do, she might just through it across the room. She might bang her head. 

00:08:00
Discipline 

00:08:05
ROB I'm gonna take you to the pictures. So come on your own, we can drag you if you like. 

00:08:10
JESSICA No… 

00:08:15
ROB Discipline is difficult with a child like Jessica or the child is autistic because you don’t know whether or not it’s intentional or whether she just doesn’t realize what’s she is doing or just doesn't understand what we want her to do. Come on daddy put the blocks away to. 

00:08:30
Language 

00:08:35
IRENE One of the biggest deficits that we have always felt Jessica has is the language or lack up 

00:08:45
ROB Giraffe 

00:08:45
JESSICA Monkey 

00:08:45
ROB Monkey 

00:08:45
JESSICA Zebra(ph) 

00:08:45
ROB I gotta go new word zebra 

00:08:50
IRENE And we always felt that she became very frustrated because of this language deficit. 

00:08:50
Transitions 

00:08:55
IRENE Listen I'm gonna count five and then I wanna go upstairs. When I think about our day with Jessica I know for the most part that transitions going from one activity to the next can be a problem. Five let's count one to one take one to eight… Okay take it upstairs. I wanna take it upstairs come on let's jump come on. 

00:09:35
ROB At times I feel like it is a waste of time and that all my efforts really aren’t…aren't worth it and it is easy to withdraw into her own little selfish worlds that we create for ourselves. And it's just a part I feel of a growing process trying to be more aware of…of…of my family's needs as oppose to just my own needs and…and…I would like to get to the point where I can may be take more control and be able to be with Jessica for an hour without feeling, oh! I am tired. You're boring me Jessica I'm going to find something else to do okay. 

00:10:20
IRENE Daddy said you're…. 

00:10:25
ROB It is frustrating and that it seems like we've been…we've had a child in the…in the terrible twos since birth up till present day and it's just doesn’t seem fair that we have to be continually subjected to these type of behaviors. 

00:10:45
[sil.] 

00:10:55
Coping 

00:11:00
IRENE Part of how I treat Jessica is partly how my mother might have treated me. 

00:11:05
Control Methods 

00:11:05
ROB How do you put this away come on? 

00:11:05
IRENE I expect her to help pick up the toys and put things away… 

00:11:10
JESSICA No… 

00:11:10
ROB Yes. 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:25
IRENE It's hard…Oh! Jess you…you hit me in the head. You hurt my nose. 

00:11:30
ROB This is a point where she is just wanna rampage or just truly lost control her sense. There is really nothing we can do other than just try to…to contain her, hold her in an…in an area confine her so that until she gets over 

00:11:45
IRENE You need to listen. You need to listen to me. 

00:11:50
IRENE So we've worked very hard at giving Jessica words to express that I may had signing the word mad or angry. You're angry. You're mad, tell me angry not easy for mommy to take you to the park when you act like this. I feel we need to be very consistent with her. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:20
IRENE Sit…sit you'll sit there till I tell you, you can get up. You sit. 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:35
IRENE One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten now pick up the keys, give it to mommy pick them up and give it to me… give it to me thank you 

00:13:05
ROB Lot of the times we have to bribe her to do something. 

00:13:10
IRENE We wanna go and get a soda come on let's go. We will get French fries. But I mean a bribe might be, Jessica if you do this then we are going to do this. Okay let's get couple of more stones, here… here is the big one. 

00:13:30
Planning 

00:13:30
IRENE Alright, alright you sit down. When I think about our day with Jessica the way that we prepare for things it's just second nature now. You sit down now. I want you to play. Alright mommy is going to get a shower. You watch TV okay. I can't just say okay honey I'm gonna to shower now, if there is a favorite video that Jessica likes to watch I'll usually put that on and of course it’s not a leisurely shower. Okay. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:05
IRENE We've just set up our house in such a way that we rotate toys. There are certain toys that might be in the living room when I need to curl my hair and put my makeup on and in another room you might have a table and chair set up with some little people. Sometimes I'll just go in a room and set up four or five different toys let her just go ahead and plan her own and then maybe I can get to read a book. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:40
Inducing Play 

00:14:40
ROB Any toys of trial and error with Jessica or with any child but because of her short attention span it seems that we have to have many more of them so that the grot cell(ph) has been, I feel, a great outlet. We…we had a closet build in and we put up some shelves and things to put them away and to take them out of her sight. 

00:15:00
IRENE (inaudible ) 

00:15:01
Boundaries 

00:15:05
IRENE In her play room we used book cases as a boundary to keep her contained use a rug. She really needed those little boundaries to help her stay in control of herself or to stay centered. 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:25
IRENE I might use even use bath time in the middle to the day for something to do with her and I could contain her for a while. 

00:15:30
Introducing changes 

00:15:35
ROB We are going to watch TV, listen to me. Jessica likes things that are familiar. She don’t wanna watch something she is not familiar with so we occasionally have to literally sit her down on the couch and sometimes even hold her there. We are going to watch a new tape tonight okay. It seems to work and that show eventually watch the whole thing. We attempt to set a time that we get her settle down into her bedroom and it may be an hour-and-a-half, two hours before we expect her to go to sleep. But we allow that time for her to play at least she is in comfort of her room. She will sit there with us and read books. If she wants to eat something such as an ice cream cone(ph) or we'll bring it to her there. When she is not confined to a small area, she just will start running around. Charlie and Ave eat everything when they plays. They drink all the milk, see they drink all the milk. 

00:16:40
Managing Outings 

00:16:40
IRENE Teddy bear cookies okay. I think about planning to go to the grocery store. We know that when we go into store Jessica is gonna get some cheese and that will help with ah… getting the shopping done. However there is one limit that I normally do place upon her is that she has to stay in the basket. It helps her to stay contained. Okay. Hi good how are you Vieira(ph). 

00:17:10
VIEIRA (ph) Fine. 

00:17:10
IRENE When I needed to…to find a bank I really looked at which bank had a drive up window because I would attempt taking Jessica into the bank and it's just such turmoil that I can't get things done. It's not a usual thing for me 

00:17:30
VIEIRA (ph) Okay write your opinion(ph). 

00:17:30
okay thanks Vieira(ph). 

00:17:30
VIEIRA (ph) Good luck 

00:17:30
IRENE Listen we are going to take off your sneakers first okay. In order to purchase shoes for Jessica, I've tried different techniques all go in with her initially and have her feet measured and sometimes that’s as far as we can get and then I might go back again take them two pair try one and then bring back the one that doesn’t fit her. Yes can I order a large pizza. 

00:17:55
ROB We've attempted to live a normal life in that we would take her to restaurants with us. We call in advance generally we will have a pie ready for us ahead of time which makes things go much…much smoother. Irene bring a long toys and.. and books and other things to keep her occupied. 

00:18:15
IRENE And I will be right back Jess. 

00:18:15
JESSICA Go down. 

00:18:20
Find it quick where is the doorbell. 

00:18:20
Relationships 

00:18:25
IRENE Relationships are an area that we've tried to foster. Say for example, my sister comes once a week ah…we found you know at some points mom and dad had to leave in order for Jessica to give her attention to someone else. If you wait for too long you could play with Jane Annett(ph) okay. 

00:18:40
JANE ANNETT (ph) We can stand here and say goodbye. 

00:18:40
IRENE Alright you play with Jane Annett(ph) Grandparents are away half of the year, so we would use taking snapshots and using the photo album. Who is it look like this…. this is grandfather. Jessica tell me what you want to do? 

00:19:00
JESSICA Humpty Dumpty(ph) 

00:19:00
IRENE You want to do Humpty Dumpty? 

00:19:00
JESSICA Okay. 

00:19:00
IRENE Okay because her language is so impaired it's hard for her to have any relationship with another child. I've had to invite a child to our home and…and have a planned activity. All the king's horses and all the kings men couldn't put Humpty together again. 

00:19:20
Oh you did. 

00:19:20
IRENE You did it. Jessica has a developmental problem. When we go out somewhere if I see people just looking at Jessica I just feel there is need to have to tell them that developmentally she is lot younger than she looks. It's almost like I am defending her actions. Jess that’s babies that's for the baby… no…no…listen that’s for the baby see. I'm always thinking what the mother thinks you know this kids just totally out of control and the mother has no discipline. For a child that has social deficit like Jessica does I instigate things where I try to instigate things. You know if they something to her I am explaining for her. You're such a nice boy to share thank you. We forgot the ball. Jess… tell her she can't have it, tell her she can only have one come on we can only play with one. 

00:20:20
Acceptance 

00:20:25
ROB In her first two years of life where she should absolutely no… no response to what's her being of no part of our world. It was…it was very to me a very depressing two years. I feel more comfortable by isolating myself to the rest of the world before around other children than you can compare and see that how another child is normal and ours isn't you can see the deficiencies of our child for with children who are also handicapped in whatever way especially in… in the autism sense and that’s depressing. So for myself I feel much more comfortable isolating myself so I don’t mind my little world with my own little child and to me she is normal. 

00:21:15
IRENE I tend to feel more comfortable with families of other special kids. I tend to feel that they have more tolerance of my child. When I think about the impact that Jessica had on our relationship, I think sometimes I don’t know about Rob, but sometimes I feel…I vent my anger to him because I am not venting it to Jessica or to whoever else. Sometimes I think it really hurts our relationship and then there are other times it's just me and him against the world and you know if just stick together and we just plug along. It's…it's never gonna to be as bad as it was. It always gets better and I think that what keeps us going. I think the other thing is our Christian believes you know we believe that we made a commitment to each other and we are committed to our child as well. 

00:22:15
ROB We would like to be of the split the…the responsibilities among one another and sometimes it's easy to…to do that another time it is not. 

00:22:25
IRENE Is it your turn father? 

00:22:25
ROB No it's yours 

00:22:25
IRENE My turn ah… 

00:22:25
ROB …that’s why if she goes there it is your responsibility. What is most important to be able to sense of each other needs and hang in there and help out as much as one can as opposed to thinking well. You do this… this… this… and I do this… this…. this and split it up. This way come on… 

00:22:45
IRENE I think Rob and I agree about the future, I definitely don’t think about her much more than a year in advance I mean I need to be planning for what her school environment needs to be and what way she need to challenged to continue her development. But I agree with Rob that for being to dwell on what’s she is going to like as a teenager is not gonna help the situation at hand although I mean I have gone as far as putting her name on a waiting list for group home because I think at some point she’s gonna need to be as independent as she can be from us. 

00:23:20
ROB Retrospectively when we were back and at any particular moment even…even now I suppose it doesn’t look like her going anywhere, but in reality there really is improvement and the… and the effort is really worth it. The little things that may not be as great as a normal child that you would expect with but little things really do mean a lot 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:50
ROB Hang up coat and hat. You know where is my scarf. 

00:23:55
IRENE Rob and I have talked about our relationship with Jessica as individuals and as a family and I does feel this bond mean it took a long time to get to this point. I appreciate so much every word that this child says. 

00:24:15
ROB I want gloves. 

00:24:15
IRENE She say I want gloves. I just like revel in every stage of development where may be if I had an average talk I might just take so much that for granted now like every little thing is…is a major accomplishment. I've always love this little girl and I think that comes through her and she is my little buddy. 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:24:50
ROB When I looked back at the past years I…I didn’t think that I would ever make it through everyday or any day for that matter and I looked back at it now and I say right I did make it through it and…and things are not as bad now as they were then and that I would think that I have grown in character that not as selfish or self-oriented as much I was previously. I still have a long way to go but Jessica is there to continually challenge me whether I like it or not. Let's pray dear god we thank you for this food and this time we can have together this evening. 

00:25:35
JESSICA Mom. 

00:25:40
ROB We thank you for mommy and daddy and Jessica. 

00:25:40
JESSICA Amen. 

00:25:40
ROB Amen. 

00:25:40
IRENE Amen.

JEAN My daughter Elaina is five-and-a half and her diagnosis is pervasive development disorder and our family are hassled consist of myself and Elaina’s sister Diana who is going to be three. Elaina’s father and I are separated and so it’s three woman in the household. Ring-a-ring-a-roses, A pocket full of posies… 

00:27:30
“ELAINA” Raising A Child With Autism The Disability 

00:27:45
JEAN I guess when Elaina was about 18 months you know I…I kept saying there's something wrong with my child and I would discuss it with her father or I would discuss it with the pediatrician and everyone would tell me you know I was crazy there is nothing wrong may be… may be I wasn't communicating properly or understanding what was that I was seeing. It just seem like she was being difficult. I guess the most significant ah…time for my child was when she was about 2 years old and I think it was almost unrelated and what I refer to as you know dispersal(ph) of her autistic tendencies at that time we began to worry if she did have a hearing problem. The language that she had began to develop at 18 months was not increasing. She wasn't retaining words that she had known or learned when she was a child and she wasn't using them appropriately. we'll hear word here and there, but for the most part she is non-verbal. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
JEAN She uses her voice to vocalize and has said on occasion or in any given time hundreds of different words, but to use those words in an appropriate form of communication is where this disability takes its worst significant effect and that’s where I became very concerned about her language, about her development. Good I told you. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:45
JEAN I'm not a teacher. I'm not a educator…you know it's a 25-year-old women having a child thinking that this child is normal I mean a pediatrician never told me that there was anything wrong with my child. So here I was really angry that a pediatrician could not pick up on my child’s developmental problems. It took us quite a few years to get an accurate diagnosis. The most difficult part for me was having a child, I hate to use this term, who is…is low functioning Umm…and have psychologist tell you that the prognosis for your child is not good. And such a child is functioning at this level at this age but that’s unusually assigned that your child is not going to be up to par and will not exceed a certain level of intelligence. And at first you know as a…as a parent as a mother instinctively you fight back you know you say that they are not right and that are wrong and they don’t understand your child and you can… you can make a difference and…and of course she always belong to that feeling that they don’t know your child and that your child can do things that they don't know about. Move this side, let me help her. 

00:31:10
Okay. 

00:31:10
JEAN What was very helpful to me was to put that energy in the beginning into learning you know about the disorder, about other children with this disorder about parents and how they cope with the disorder and their children and then to go the whole gamut of trying everything and anything and that could be real helpful to a certain extent because then you get caught up and I want to fix my kid. My kid is going to be better you know and my kid is going to be normal and I think that don't feel that way anymore. And I want my kid to have opportunities but I want her to be for good about that she can be where she is. 

00:32:15
The Symptoms 

00:32:20
JEAN Her symptoms and her behaviors are ever changing and she is into everything and she learns about things in physical way of exploring, climbing and..and getting into and being destructive and things that you would expect much younger child where they don’t have really any comprehension or any boundaries you can't list her boundaries. You can tell her not to in the water and five minutes later she is going to be back playing in the water. And a week from now once you think that you're over that particular issue, she is back to that. So that is a kind of ongoing thing which most parents of a five year old or above and she needs to be constantly supervised and you know she needs intervention to play appropriately and for her time to be meaningful. 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:20
JEAN Elaina doesn’t have much purpose for play. The constant repetition of aimless play you know getting a draw and emptying everything out of the drawer and just you know running away with it and throwing it on the floor. You know she is constantly climbing on to furniture, standing on the stove to get things out of the cabinets, which are locked but you know she'll climb up there and try to get things and I still do have to watch her because she believe things and she will climb on things or get stuck and thinks that could be potentially dangerous. My child would mouth everything and eat crayons and inappropriate items. Elaina has a tendency to just grab things you know instinctively she wants to eat. If she sees it, she will grab hot pot or spoon and the whole idea of danger to her is not easily communicated. Elaina that’s hot that’s hot danger…danger you need to sit in your chair you could be hurt that’s very hot. It’s very hot, you mustn’t touch the stove, dangerous. And even when it is not meal time and she has in her mind that she wants to eat or that she’s bored you know the refrigerator then becomes a play area for her and that she will empty out on to table and pour the ketchup all over the table or anything that she can play with it actually. Shopping and going out in public and getting haircuts and that type of thing presents a challenge to say the least because Elaina is so distractive in these situations where you know you walk into shoe store and she will pull the shoes off of the display and one in and out of the back room and behind the counter and it’s like this nervous type of energy in it and I have to be really have a lot of energy to…to stay up with her and to be able to control this the environment. Elaina has her share of tantruming(ph) and not being able to comply to it's time to leave an activity. It’s time to leave Elaina. A transition between or walking by the store and not going into the store. Not today come on standup not today… not today come on. You have to stand up and walk come on we will come another time, okay. Excuse me, me and Elaina are reading the book. Where is your book but then you give me the caterpillar book and I will give you this book or you can sit and read it with me and Elaina. It's difficult to balance my attention between a demanding two-year-old and a child who wants your attention but really doesn’t need it or doesn't want it actually and then in that Diana sees me you know holding her or hugging her and then automatically she wants that and being a two-year-old she demands that you know it's my turn to be held or you know I need a hug.

00:36:55
JEAN It continues to amaze me how much Diana will continue to try and interact with Elaina when she doesn’t usually get anything in return. She does want to play with you. She is trying and try again. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:20
JEAN She does she just doesn't understand how are you playing. Why don't you just teach her what is that you want. (inaudible ). It's really encouraging to me that she…she just never gives up. She just continues to play as if Elaina is interacting with her and I think it’s a wonderful thing for Elaina. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:50
JEAN The thing that scares me and makes me very angry a lot of times is that Diana imitates Elaina because she wants the same attention. It can be really crazy and at the same time I don’t want to discourage her totally from imitating Elaina because I think it’s a positive thing for her. 

00:38:10

00:38:15
Coping 

00:38:20
JEAN The best thing that ever happened to me was to have her be in…in a program you know where she is now you know a regular five day program of intervention where she was not the exception. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:45
Hi Elaina hi good job 

00:38:50
JEAN Do you want more milk? Being a single parent, the majority of the care for my children is provided from me even if she is in school from 8.30 to 2. I still have to be responsible for her care and all the routine dinner and bath time and preparing for school and scheduling the therapies and it…it…it's very stressful. Let's get these (inaudible ). I try to find as frequently as possible time where I can totally divorce myself from family life, from children and spend time for myself. I like to go to the gym and work out and I do that on a regular basis. I'm very fortunate to have a respite person provided by our county who I’ve had since Elaina’s diagnosis. My parents are real significant support system for me and that you know not only emotionally but physically they are close by and we spend a lot of time together and they'll babysit the children and…and they are comfortable with the children. It's been helpful to give some thought to activities prior to attempting them. I try to put myself as much as possible in my child shoes. I tried to think before I plan an activity or do an activity how well she relate to this and will this be a pleasurable experience and to have enough energy to deal with this experience. 

00:40:40
JEAN Bye. (inaudible ) Come on let's go. get from here… Get out of here. Come on you'd have to take a walk to (inaudible ) patty before we go. Do you have use the patty listen to me I'm talking to you. Okay now let’s go. It's time to go… go… go… this is the problem getting her out of here we've run into this every time. Almost done hang in there. In the supermarket I keep her in the cart so that the food isn’t on the floor and… and… and in her mouth I mean and when you go to the check out and they have all the candy there. I have to make sure that she has a cracker before we get to that point and that I unload the cart before we get to that point. No you don't drop it. Mummy will get all the stuff up here (inaudible ). It's helpful in doing these different type of activities that you stay with this same routines and the same people and it's comfortable for both me and my child that her hair dresser and where we buy her shoes and where we go to the market or neighborhood people and they know her and they've known her since you know she was a child. I mean I was put up in a home where everything is beautiful and gorgeous and…and…for most of us these things are important. But you like all these things by necessity you know things have to be safe and…and functional and in her room I tried her to provide a place where number one I can lock her in there and she can be safe in there if I need to take a shower. If I need some time or she need some time to know you know where she is having a difficult time tantruming or total un-relatedness where she just really needs to be alone when she wakes up at 3 o’clock in the morning and I need to sleep. I can lock her in there and I can know that she can’t get out and that…that the room provides her with opportunities to play. Our bathrooms are locked unless it's day time where she can use the toilet herself. At night of course medicines and cleaning fluids and anything that would not be appropriate to eat is locked as well as the cabinets that has food in them because she will help herself. So we set boundaries you know when I am upstairs there’s a gate at the top of the steps so in limiting the space I can control the environment. I provided one particular room that is play room for her and mostly everything in that room is for her to play with and I tried to set up the room so that the toys are right there in front of her. So I tried to choose to toys for her that she likes each or anything with action, anything that’s music related are the things that she will attend to for longer periods of time and she has trampoline that she can jump on and climb and she has a therapy ball or hippity hop that she can hold on or play on. There are toys set up in her room that she can easily get and that things that she will play with. We spend a great deal of time at home for sensory oriented type activities rough and tumble play and trying to fulfill these ah…somewhat inappropriate behaviors of climbing and exploring in aimless fashion. For Elaina deep pressure and traction type pulling and…and pushing are real significant input for her. She becomes very connected and…and relates in that way this is how common ground of relating. Push, push, push. 

00:44:55

00:45:00
JEAN The bath tub is a very neutral ground for play as well for some time out for mom. She is in a controlled spot. I also found that for the two of my children to play together and relate together that the bath tub has been a real positive thing. And Diana can be intrusive because Elaina can't go anywhere and it's okay with her because she is in water. Up and down… 

00:45:30
Up and down. 

00:45:35
JEAN In our yard we have and she has swings (inaudible ) swings what something that she could just climb on. We have a six foot fence that’s locked so she is pretty safe in the yard and it's an area where she can have some aspect of freedom. Summer time our sand box is outside and that’s a big activity again where we have more interaction between Elaina and her sister Diana and in the winter time we bring the sand box indoors and try to hold in to some extent the amount of time that she will play or attend to a particular task. You could stay and play. I'm not going to hurt you. 

00:46:25
DIANA Ah… we play games. 

00:46:30
JEAN Sure we'll play games and I'm really thankful that I have Diana and you know I don’t think that had I know the significance of Elaina’s disorder that I would have had another child because I would have you know thought that it would be too difficult and in essence I think that it's almost ah… helpful. I think that the relationship that they have and that is developing between them is real significant for both of my children. I try to use the end of the evening as time where we can have some interaction. Elaina really likes music. It's very soothing to her and I use it a lot before bedtime. Touch you look sleepy. You wanna go to bed. 

00:47:35
Acceptance 

00:47:40
JEAN It's lonely to have a child with a disability because may be you have a feeling that no one can really share with you what’s going on ah…I find that the most intimate relationship I have are with parents of children with the same type of disability where you can relate to have difficult something as or…or the struggle of everyday life. A lot of the pleasurable times for both me and Elaina are when it's just the two of us. And to the right… You know lot of times I exaggerate the fact that you know this my child and she looks normal, but I am signing as I walk into stores so that people are going to come up to her and say hello how are you today and…and look at you know look at me blankly like why isn’t she answering. Talk that's right, if my child doesn’t speak it’s not going to be the end of the world you know that…that’s something you learn to accept and make a part of your life. A boy. He's a boy. A boy. I felt angry a lot you know when you about things and you expect things to be a certain way you certainly don’t have to think about a five-year-old needing to be dressed, needing to ah…have help eating… to have help toileting, still wearing diapers at night. You don't ever anticipate those things. She doesn’t view the world in the way we do, so for her this a really strange place to be and that so hard thing to realize. You know that…that…that your child is not doing this on purpose and that she does always have control over how she proceeds things and the way she behaves. You know I accept that my child is this way and I am not waiting for her to be fixed or…or better acquired because you know to me that’s unrealistic thing in it and…and…helping for something that’s unrealistic. You can deal with the realities of what your life is about. It’s difficult you know it's certainly is difficult, but I tried to look at it as you know it's my responsibility. It's my child’s destiny, it’s my destiny and the more I fight the more difficult it is. Elaina is ah…the best and worst of my life. She’s is difficult you know there’s no way around that but I feel really fortunate and blessed to have her because ah… I'm not only me but I think everybody of my family has something to learn from her and for me the most important thing to learn is just because she is different doesn’t make her… her life any less significant or important and that she has the right to be the way she is.
