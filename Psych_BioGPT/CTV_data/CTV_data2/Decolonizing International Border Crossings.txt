DR. KATHRYN NORSWORTHY Thank you so much, and I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude, uh, uh, to the Round Table, uh, for this invitation. It's an-, really an honor to be here. Um, so what I'd like to do is share that, uh, I'd like to tell some stories actually during the time that I have. I'm gonna start with just a little background and then I'm gonna sort of hopefully give-, I'd like to bring to live a little bit about the work that I've been doing there in collaboration with local partners. Um, so let me begin. For the past 25-years as, uh, you've heard, I've been traveling to South and Southeast Asia. The first decade I was a back-packer learning, studying Buddhism and Yoga and "hanging out". For the last 15, uh, as you just heard, I've been involved in a range of peace and justice activities, um, the ones that have already been described. Uh, especially with the refugee communities of Burma, uh, and primarily also with Tai groups, uh, in various parts of the country. Uh, several of my partners and I have also been doing regional and internationally focused work that takes place over in-, on that side of the world. Um, today I'd like to start with some things that I think set the stage for the stories I wanna share with you about this work and about the partnerships, uh, that I have formed and what I've learned through them. So here we go. As many global, trans-national, post-colonial, and liberation feminist emphasize; the U.S. occupies a dominant, social, and political location at the global level, as we all know. U.S. economics, politics, media, and corporate policies and practices have profound influence. Many outside this country view the U.S. as imperialistic, oppressive, and colonizing. Others idealize or at best hold ambivalent feelings about our country and by de-fault about us as we enter their spaces. U.S. professionals traveling outside of our country, particularity in the global south which has sometimes been referred to hierarchically as the third-world, to consult teacher do research or engage activist activities are likely to encounter these various sentiments. In. . . in the per-, from the prospect-, my own prospective in those of the partners that I've been working with, uh, in that region, we need to have a-, what we call the free area in critical consciousness about this whole matter in order to form effective and successful relationships based in power-sharing and to avoid replicating our county's colonizing, social, and political patterns. So working and doing research in a-, internationally requires our awareness of these power dynamics, uh, in the systems of oppression that also exist in the countries in which we've work. This was actually something that really struck me as I started having conversations with my local partners. They pointed out, this is a quote from one-one, a colleague there, "The way the Western Expert comes in, often is exactly the way we see our own government going into vi-, to villages and developing the people. For example; mostly the experts the-, come first. The-the, the become advisors and stay at the top level and they are usually male. . . White and Western. And the Tai Government People," 'cuz this was a Tai collaborator, "will go to them. And the Western Expert gives technical advice. So that already enforces the idea that men know how to develop society. This is everywhere in the world," she says, "not just Thailand. When you have high education, you are a man, you are white, you have opportunities to really develop yourself into a certain status in society. And then you are invited to come here to Thailand," uh, "and even with good intentions, you assume the role of expert. But before that in Thailand; the government already considered themselves the expert. Going to every village and fixing the problems of the villagers. Disregarding the wisdom of the local people. So when this model is reinforced by Westerners, it makes it harder to dismantle that top-down/trickle-down model." . . . So, uh, she feels that we need to remember that when we as Westerners travel to other countries, we're entering hierarchical systems. Just like the one that we have. . . here, um, where the government and them, for as a privilege social group quite often well educated upper-class men, may define reality and take on take on paternalistic roles prescribing what is best for the local people. When the Western "Expert" operates without understand the local culture, as we just heard in the previous presentation, um, and without consciousness regarding his or her power or privilege, she or he or strengthening the pre-existing dynamics of top-down domination and subordination in relation to culture, race, ethnicity, social-class, gender, sexual orientation and other social locations within the country. Uh, this is also an issue as we know. Because we've explored it and really started having wonderful conversations within, uh, this-the, uh, psychological community, uh, that-this is something we're also sort of dealing when with-, within this international movement in psychology. For example; I wanted to share, uh, I was recently at a U.S. Psychology Conference, and I heard several activists from the Philippines who said, "The academics form the West come to our country and go straight to the universities, their-, this is, uh, can be a problem. Because while the academics in government perfessional-, professionals have a lot of influence on us, in terms of what practices we should use on the ground. Um, where funding will be directed and who can do our jobs, we actually have little if any influence in the up-, other direction, the trickle-up direction. So the Western academic just reinforces a system that is already exclusive and in which we have no voice." Now we know this is not the case in-, for every person who travels into the global south to work. But it's certainty is something to pay attention to. Uh, so what I would like to do, uh, is-is to share one more story from the-, I-I like to always bring in the Burma perspective because this is a group with whom I've worked extensively and feel a solidarity in their democracy movement. One of the friends from Burma, uh, with whom we were partnering said, "We don't-," uh, about a research report written by Westerner about the situation in Burma. "We don't know where she got her information. She said things that were not true and did not show what is happening as it really is. She didn't tell about the difficulties of the ethnic minority groups of Burma. How they are targeted by the current military dictatorship for forced labor and for torture. The Westerners, they only want to come over and study us and go home, and publish their article, or get their degree. They benefit from our problems." This one really hit me, and I heard it actually, uh, I've heard it many, many times over the, you know 15-years that I've been, uh, working there. So as a feminist psychology; these are the tensions, uh, and-and, kind of, uh. . . issues that I feel like I am trying to wrestle with to hold, and to struggle with as I as a White Westerner go into the global south to work. Um, and so I'd like to share a little bit more about some sort of, uh, day-to-day, uh, stories in relation to what, uh, what my partners and I have been doing. So I'm gonna get my slide show going, I'm not-, I don't have power point. What I wanted to do is show you images, uh, of the work that we do because I thought it would bring it to life as we-, as I go through and fit-, and tell you the stories. I've had the privilege of forming the a 15-year relationship with my dear friend, and colleague, and collaborator Ouyporn Khaunkaew. Ouyporn is the person you see where with me in this photo. Ouyporn is a Tai feminist activist and public intellectual who lives just outside the northern city of Chaing Mai in Thailand. Our pass crossed by accident, some might say syncrinisi- synchronistically the time was pre-email. After being introduced through a colleague, Ouyporn and I spent almost a year corresponding by letter and fax. Imagine it, getting acquainted and decide to work together. On December 25, 1997 we met in person at a traveler's hotel in the back-pack district of Bangkok. We noted later that in planning our first project, we fell into the template for the global order. Me, a White U.S. PhD level feminist counseling psychologist, as primary facilitator of this project and Ouyporn, Tai, woman of color, Masters, educated feminist activist, and educator as the translator. We had agreed to do a three-day workshop for a non-governmental organization in Thailand under the topic of violence against women. However; only a few hours into the first day the power dynamics of our partnership began to shift as it became clear to each of us, and-and quit frankly because Ouyporn is a very strong woman, um, had important contributions to make to the process in which we were engaged. So later as we reflected we were both actually-, we discovered we were both actually uncomfortable with this original hierarchical arrangement. Particularly, uh, once we were immersed in the realities of and implementing our plan.So that day-two of that workshop, we were sharing ideas about what to do and slowly shifting to a model of co-facilitation, uh, that was actually more, uh, based in power-sharing. We were lucky because of our feminist roots in social justice values, we allowed the discomfort that we felt about those original arrangements to inform us as we debriefed that first workshop, and made plans for future work together. After a long conversation we made a commitment to restructure our relationship in our roles based feminist power-sharing values. Just want to keep up with the time. We spent the last-, we had spent now the last 14-years working, uh, out the details engaging in difficult dialogues, and in the negotiation process, and in discovering fulfillment and satisfaction in our growth in relationship with one another, and with the groups, and partners with whom we've worked. So, when Ouyporn and I first met, we actually knew very little about one another and I kind of wanted to mention this piece of it because it taught-, it really illustrates, um, how important shared values can be with partnerships, the willingness to take risks. And also as we heard from our previous, uh, speaker the importance of making a commitment. . .and going back when you are coming in from the outside, and coming from the West, and to the importance of sustainability, and building that into projects. So even though we did-, we didn't know much about one another, we felt that each was very familiar to the other even though we had actually grown up on other sides of the world. So on the long bus ride back to Bangkok after that first workshop; we took a chance on authentically sharing about our lives and what led us to the com-, our commitments to social justice, feminism, and activism. And we had many "ah-ha" delight-delighted "ah-ha" moments, um, throughout this conversation. Uh, it was as if we-we always say actually, that we had found a long lost sister. As we discovered our common ground within the sea of differences that we hold in terms of identities, social and cultural contacts, regions of the world, psychologies and world views, professional preparations, and career paths. So during that journey we discovered we both grew up in high-stress, working poor, working-class environments, uh, that led us to a strong appreciation for injustices connected with social class, and a commitment the-to change society in relation to classes of impoverty. We also had both identified as Buddhist, and of course, um, Ouyporn was born into a Buddhist Society and consciously, of course embraced Buddhism and maintained that, uh, commitment. I adopted Buddhism about 15-years earlier before I got there. And we also were really delighted that we had both, uh, that we had both, uh, really gotten interested in the Engaged Buddhist Movement which is kind of the Social Justice Branch of Buddhism. And of course we both, uh, have a strong and established that we have a strong commitment to feminist-feminism and feminist activism. One of the greatest risk we took at that bus ride was to come out to one another. A move that for both of us, given the heterosexism and homophobia, uh, that surrounded us both in Thailand and of course at the time that I went to, um. . . went there. . .started my work there. I was also in a. . .in a environment in Orlando that was actually still quite difficult for the GLBT community.This was a move that took us outside our comfort zones since we're from op-opposite sides of the world and we barely knew each other. We both liv-, uh-uh. . . as I said we both lived in these context of homophobia and heterosexism, so it felt like a very bold, uh, leap of faith at a whole new level to really share about our sexual orientation. In my case, my partner Dena had come with me on that initial trip. So my technique was to introduce Dena as my partner. Ouyporn, after wholeheartedly affirming Dena's and my relationship, simply blurted our that she too was attracted to women. If you hear the language difference it has to do with the ways in which people identify in relations of sexual orientation in the Tai language and we were speaking English. In retrospect; it's clear to us that this shared identity and our willingness to take this risk really, uh, reflected I think, sort of what was to follow which was continuing to take risks like that to really have open frank and candid conversations as we worked together which has really been very, very important in all of our-, in both of our growth and learning, and also learning with the groups with whom we worked. Uh, so we also realized though, that we have a lot of differences. I am a White U.S., as I mentioned, well educated Western Psychologist that comes from a country that is, uh, you know, quite, uh, powerful globally. Um, Ouyporn on the other hand, uh, you know, is a Tai woman of color, she is an insider, uh, in-in that area. Um, and she has the mixed experiences of holding cultural, ethnic, and national identities that offer here much in common with our participants in the various countries, especially the refuge community of Burma and in Thailand, uh, with whom we work. Um, but on the other hand she holds privilege in particular ways and that she's usually better educated than the people she works with and hold greater social influence quite often. Uh, yet side-by-side with me as she and I have discussed, um, often her power can be overshadowed, uh, in terms of the differing national and ethnic identities that we hold and how skilfully we manage the power dynamics between the two of us. So these differences, as I mentioned, have posed challenged to us from time-to-time and tremendous opportunities for growth. One example; for a number of years we worked on projects with the refuge, uh, women's communities of Burma, as I've said before, um, Thailand, by-the-way, is populated-populated by over a million refuges from Burma. Most living without legal status after fleeing the Dictatorship. And I would like to mention that we use the term Burma rather than Myanmar when-, to show solidarity with the demarcating movement. Um, so a-a major issue that had been, uh, identified by the women of Burma as something important to them was violence against women. . . in their own homes, in the Tai community where they were vulnerable to exploitation by the police. And in their home countries where rape was systematically used to by the military dictatorship as a weapon of war and genocide, and particularly for the ethnic minority women. So shortly after we met, we-, Ouyporn and I felt that it was important to try to develop a feminist liberation methodology, uh, that was grounded in critical theory, these are some of the things that informed, some of the areas that informed. We sort of drew from critical theory, liberation theory, participant action methodologies, feminism, um, uh, and, uh, a range of those liberatory, uh, perspectives in-in putting together a methodology, uh, that involved collaborating with our local partners supporting, uh, them in voicing their own problems and concerns, analysing for themselves the root causes of this violence against women that they were concerned about. And developing and carrying out action plans aimed at changing the system of inequality that-that supported the violence. So, we- and we and the local partners with whom we worked focused on building families communities and societies of peace and justice. Uh, so within the process of doing this work, uh, we started working with a particular women's organization and we were working over several, uh, workshop periods. So we started in maybe January and then we had another workshop a few months later, and a follow-up and another and another. Um, so we had spent considerable time prior to the first workshop, developing a plan for how to facilitate this process, um, and so early on in the usual-, in our work, uh, in which we all sat on matts on the floor. We, uh, vit-, uh, we invited the participants to brainstorm their ideas of feminist values and principles they believe would be important in grounding the infrastructure and ongoing processes of an organization that they wanted to-to. . . uh, organize to support the work that they were gonna be doing. So it's a particular ethnic group who wanted to form an organization and they wanted to set the organization up using feminist values. So we had a very interesting learning in this process that I'd like to share. So, we in our usuall manner, we got people together, we, uh, invited people to, uh, engage in some, sort of engage in some experiences that basically drew out, as we call it the knowledge and wisdom from the group around violence against women, and around what their concerns were, and why they wanted to build this organization. Uh, at the next juncture we dis-, we thought that we would provide a frame for this group to actually nail. . . think about feminist values and principles that they would like to use to ground their organization and build it. So, uh, having located, uh, what we thought would be a useful list, written in English of contrasting patriotical values side-by-side with "Western" feminist values. We also offered this list to the group in addition to supporting them and thinking about how they would like to identify feminist principals. One of our local partners, with whom we were working, um, and with sort of the cultural bridge for this group as well, was serving as translator so that we could all communicate with one another. Since there were, or actually the Burma community they- there are a number of languages that are spoken, so, uh, we're off-offten doing a lot of translation among, uh, people and in-between us and the, the group members. Um, so they got together, and we were sitting in a circle, and as we, uh, you know we're working together; the participants started looking at the list that we had provided. Um, and Ouyporn and I were sitting there. . . sort of at that point, observing the process. Within minutes the 18-group members began to draw closer, and closer together, leaning in, heads nearly touching, becoming increasingly more animated. Soon Ouyporn and I were outside the circle a bit puzzled about the change in energy and the intensity of this conversation. At some point we asked our local partner, Dutdao Lee, what was happening? And she said, "The list you gave our group, there are many words on it that are not part of our local languages, or even Burmese," Which is the dominate language in Burma, "there is no direct translation and in some cases, nothing in our language that is even close." So they're trying to get the meaning through a discussion. A couple of the women speak English, so they're trying to help. The group is actually now in the process of inventing their own terminology based on our cultural values and experiences. And they are saying, "We are not even sure we want a "Democratic" organization. Which was one of the terms to define on the feminist side of the, of the list. Because in a democracy people's voices get left out. Small groups of people who are not part of the main-stream are not represented. We liv-, we have lived in a dictatorship, a totalitarian system and we want something better than democracy." In that moment, we. . . were a bit taken about, we were surprised. And we had. . .we realized that had-, and employed a model that was based in that sort of teacher centered expert model in methodology. And that had the group members not been the strong,empowered women that they were, we could have been part of yet another form of potential colonization that "experts" from the outside. Forty-five minutes later the group informed us that they had decided to take a break for lunch. And when we came back, we debriefed what had happened. They shared their struggles, first because they were all too familiar with models of power over, uh, clearly from their own experiences. Um, but also the other issue was that they did have, as they said, um, examples that they could think of, of power-sharing models. And this is something that we always encounter in the work that we do when we're working with groups to help them think about examples of power-sharing in the communities in which they live. Uh, so on the-, on the one hand since there were-, they couldn't think of too many models, uh, to immolate. They appreciated the chart we had given them, but on the other hand as we heard there were a number of concepts in terms that were not translatable or even part of their cultural constructions of the world; hence, as I think feminine- feminism "plural" has illustrated. Um, you know, there are multiple perspectives and multiple realities. Um, so-, and I just wanted to mention that this reality was reinforced actually a few months later when one of our Tai colleagues who had been working closely with Westerners involved in the early "gender" movement in Thailand. Made the comment too, that the word gender was not part of Tai vocabulary and described how some of the foreign "gender experts" had become very frustrated with the Tai group in which she was involved. When the group members took considerable time trying to figure out what in the world was gender and coming up actually inventing their own, uh, language of gender that is-, was grounded in Tai culture in context. So ultimately, the women did create a feminist organization, but it was based on their mutually agreed upon sort of values and principles of power-sharing. And they actually decided on a more horizontal model of leadership and decision making by consensus. I think they felt so, uh, disillusioned and they were, you know, having come out of this, uh, dictatorship really powered over, uh, government that they felt it was very important to involve, uh, every voice in the group to the fullest extent possible in making decisions. Um, so this really struck us as very im-, a very important learning, um. . .since we occupy this kind of outsider role in that particular situation and that the. . . the ki-, type of consultation or facilitation methodology that we use will either support a group in accessing it's own knowledge, and wisdom, and strengths, or it can get in the way and create tension, and resistance, and complicate the group's work. Um, one of the things Ouyporn said to tell you is, "we need to bring a humble mind to the work, one that recognizes that local people are the expert on their own lives and that they have the knowledge in wisdom to solve their own problems." It's very much like Pallon(ph) Freie's(ph) idea. "The facilitators," she feels, "provide the structure and the space for the participants to listen to themselves, to find and express their own voices. And we need as facilitators, or consultants to embrace the position that we are all teachers and learners together order to be successful." And of course this is the feminist principle of mutuality. For me, the thing I wanted to add because one of the things that happened to me when I first started to work there, I got a bit of immobilized because, because I do really strongly, uh, you know, subscribe to a liberation and feminist framework. And I did-, I wanted to be aware of the ways I used my power and privilege as a Western-, white Westerner coming in. And so I think I actually, in the early days, to some extent silenced myself. Um, and, uh, I, I, uh, it was probably alright really, because I, I really deferred to, which is really important, my local partners and kind of what they thought and so on. But I think what I have learned over the years is that, um, there is a role that we can play as an outsider who comes in. That, uh, you know, that again the values, and the principles, and the practices in which we engage really, uh, I think have everything to do with weather it works or not. And so my thought was that, what I've come, to is that I feel that I have something to offer and that as an outsider, th-, as-, as you know, you know, where ever you stand, there are things that you can see that other people can't see. And the more that I've sort of, of course gone to Thailand and gone and worked in the area and, and really learned deeply, more deeply never will know, uh, at-, uh, completely about the Tai cultures. Um, and the various cultures of Burma. I think the more I've been able to sort of have one foot in and one foot out in-a-way that allows me to offer these perspectives, uh, and invite people to take a look at those while still operating in a way that leaves the space open for people to make their own decisions. So-, so it's a very interesting balancing act, I feel like that, uh, I'm, you know, sort of holding for myself. Uh, the other story that I wanna te-tell you, um, is, uh. . . I wanna make sure that I have time for this one, so let me, uh. . . I'll, I'll tell you, I have two, I wanna- I'm making a decision about the time. The second one, um. . . one of the things tha also I think is fascinating is that when we go into another space, um, we bring all of our identities with us and of course, I've mentioned in my case, uh, the ones that have been salient so much of the time which are the-, the-, these privilege identities. But the other piece is that I actually, of course also hold a marginalized identity as a Lesbian that is relevant and significant and becomes salient at times also in the work that I do. And so, its- it can be an interesting inner-play there, uh, for me individually and also in relation to the teams with whom I work and with whom Ouyporn and I work when we're doing these partnerships. So I wanted to tell you a story about another situation where, uh, Ouyporn and I was working with a different group from Burma. And, uh, again it was a pa-, it was a model, we like to use models that are again, uh, not the drop-in and drop-out model that are so often the case. But a model where we had several, uh, a project that went on for about a year and a half. And we worked over time with a group of women of Burma leaders who were, who-, on a women's leadership project that involved capacity building and supporting them and being able to take the role, uh, as leaders in the democracy movement. Because women had been un-, under represented in that movement. And it was a multi-ethnic group, that particular group. Um, we partnered with it- with, uh, Ouyporn- so the three, uh, main partners were in this project; were Ouyporn as a Tai. . . woman who had- and-and whose country over a million refuges reside. . . me, and a man named Mu(ph) who was is- is a gay man from Burma. He's. . .ethnically "Burman" which is the dominate group in Burma. And Mu had lost his partner during the 1988 up-rising and had had to escape. This was a time when a lot of university students had really risen-up and opposition to the government. So, uh, the three of us had been asked to work with this group. And, uh, so uh, as we sort of went along we started realizing that there were some clear participants in the group as well. Though they didn't seem to be very out, but it was clear to us that the members of the group were aware of their sexual orientation. And Mu, because he was the cultural bridge and then we had another woman who was also a cultural bridge from, uh, within the group as well a local partner. Uh, they also had a more inside understanding of what was happening. But we could see that these, these two or three participations were feeling rather disenfranchised. And the-the focus. . . one. . . part of the focus of the work was, uh, anti-oppression and, uh, um, social justice oriented, uh, work. Um, so. . .as we went along-, we went through the first workshop and then we came back. And we thought this is going on, how are we going to deal with it? And we felt, it-it we had a lot of consultation about it the four members of the team to sort of try to talk through what might be appropriate. Now this was really important for me to mention now that, uh, it was, you know, here is a place where I am coming from the outside and, uh, it was crucial that we come to a consensus within our team because we had people representing, you know, the community involved to try to make a call on this. And I do wanna mention one thing, and that is that this was very ironic because I wa-was told later. A couple of people said, "You know one of the reasons we have this homophobia in our society is because of the earlier exploitation of psycho-analytic perspective on homosexuality." And some of these early perspectives from the psychology and psychiatric community from the West on homosexuality. And also, uh, because of the, uh, ways in which Burma was colonized by, uh, religiously based groups who, uh, held the same perspective. So in a way here, uh, I was, like, here we are trying to undo in some ways what we have sort of set over to start with. It was very it was very ironic. So what we decided? We decided to tackle this and what we decided to do is; we decided to do an experiential exercise. Some of you probably done it. We had our own sort of little version of it. Uh, we call it sometimes the diversity walk over here. Um, and what we, what we did is that we decided as facilitators; the three Mu, Ouyporn and I, would be-, would be participant facilitators in that particular exercise. Because we felt like, we- here we had the margin-, all three of us had the marginalized identity. But we also had privilege identities, two of us in particular. Um, so here is what we did. We asked the group to line up, um, and we, uh, started the exercise and we were in the line with the group. And we stood with them. And so we started making statements. And as we made the statement, we asked the group members to walk out to stand, to turn around, to face the group and then to come back. Um, so, uh, we went through . . . so that's what we did and we went through several, of course we went through several, uh, statements. Quite a few that were, uh, ones that we felt that were everyone could relate to and were less threatening. Step forward if you have brothers and sisters. Step forward if you speak more than one language. Which nearly every member did. Step forward if you had books to read at home when you were growing up. Getting a little bit more-, uh, a little bit out of the comfort zone. Step forward if you've ever been discriminated against because of your ethnicity or culture. The whole group stepped out. So now we get to the big one. Step out if you're been looked down on or discriminated against because you are "gay or lesbian" or because you love someone of the same gender. Um, so then all three of us stepped out and the other two, two of the participants who identified, uh . . . as clear also stepped out as well. So we walked out we stood. We turned around and we looked, and we saw of course, a range of , uh, responses because while Mu, people knew that he was gay, Ouyporn and I had not come out before. That was one thing I wanted to mention at that point. We had not come out to this community. Of course, we're now out to everyone, 'coz after that we're out to the entire Burma community. Um, and so we had a . . . in. . . the looks all the way from stunned to, um, you know, uh, delighted to dead-pan. Um, and then we walked back. And so at the end of that, uh, exercise of course in the usual fashion we debriefed. And the, uh, you know, it was a very, very powerful debriefing and we got into a lot of discussions about people's cultural perspective and sexual orientation. And, and also gender identity, because those, I'm using Western terminologies, but those are very enter-twined actually in, uh, in those regions. Um, and, uh, really sort of unpacked a lot of the ways that people came to hold the perspective they hold. And the members who had stepped out with us were very, uh, I think they. . .ultimately they were. . . scared to death, they said when they stepped out. But ultimately they felt very empowered by the, uh, experience and felt that, uh, a step had been taken that day. Um, the rest of the story was that, uh, from that point forward at least in those groups, the, um, uh, the. . .whole area the-the group members became more, uh, out. Those two, we became more out and there was a transformation of conspicuousness for a large percentage not all of the group members. The other thing that happened 00:43:15]that we were really, uh, happy about is that Mu, who had been trying for quite a while to find his way into the leadership of the Burma democracy movement. But had had a lot of difficulty because he experienced so much homophobia, actually, I think felt that we had stood in solidarity with him. and he gained a great deal of respect from the group. And he now has gone on to from his own human rights organization, and also a group for the LGBT Burma community which has become very, very vibrant and alive and exist to this day and is doing amazing things. So, uh, you know I hope what you've been able to see, I've got a little signal there that we were getting close to the end, uh, we are at the end. Um, and-and I hope that you've been able to see the, uh, just a tiny bit of the complexities of, um, at least the work that we have been doing in, uh, Thailand and in with the refuge communities of Burma and in other areas. And the ways that we wrestle with and have tension around, uh, you know, how we're gonna negotiate identities. Ouyporn and I've had some really interesting conversations at times when we've been in the middle of a workshop, for example and, um. . . she had- and I have been working with a group and this is me, you know, and I hope you can relate to this. So we're working along and Ouyporn, I remember once said, uh, to me we were with a group, she says, "How do you think it's going?" I said, "Oh I think it's great. Aren't the group's really participating. I'm really excited." And I looked at her and she had this frown on her face. And she-, I said, "What's, what's going on?" She said, "Didn't you notice? The group members are only looking at you." Because this is one of the common challenges. Here's the Tai facilitator and the Western facilitator and quite often we also get identified as the "expert" by the group in a way that diminishes the role of the ca- collaborator if we're not careful. And I, and I was I had not even realized it. I had fallen into that "in-culturation(ph)" that-that happened when I was going through school and growing up in this country. Of course, I was turned red, and I said, "Oh. I see." and I've been reinforcing that. So we'd sat down and had a conversation about how we were gonna rectify the situation and essentially, re-directed group to Ouyporn until we could get, uh, the group dynamic re-established to a more power-sharing model between the two of us. We feel that the-, the frank discussions, reflections, and dialogue between us and with members of the group in relation to power are crucial in all of this. And, uh, we-, Ouyporn would like to convey that, uh, you know, she feels very strongly that, uh, it's very important when Westerners come over to-, there's the kind of, um, willingness to share and learn together that is crucial to doing the work. Um, when we, when we cross borders. Thank you. That particular local collaborator, uh, there were two in the, in the example I gave with Ouyporn, Mu, me and the local collaborator. The other local collaborator, she was actually from the Korean, uh, ethnic minority group of Burma. The local, uh, the person who was the link to that women's leadership organization. It was called the Women's Link of Burma. And they are multi-ethnic group. . . of, uh. . .of women who comes from a lot of the different ethnic minority groups of Burma as well as from the Burmain. . . uh, dominate group and come together to work on, uh, developing skills to. . . enter into the democracy movement as leaders. So Mu was from the Burmain group. So we had sort of this whole mix of people that were involved in that conversation. And it's interesting 'coz the Korean people were, uh, actually, uh, they adopted, primarily adopted a large percentage of them actually were col-, during colonization they were favored by the British, the British. And they adopted Christianity. And there was a lot of and there-, there was a source. They talked about it of where some of the ideas about homosexuality had originated. When we unpacked it at the end. . . Yeah the whole issue of conflict is culturally embedded in how we negotiate those things. And, and, uh, I really appreciate you bringing that up. Because one of the things that's happen for me is it's been a long process of, uh, getting-, forming relationships that would support more direct conversations. Wm, when I first, uh, you know, started working, Ouyporn and I actually, um, for example you know in Tai culture, there's a co-, this concept to saving face that's really important. And so there was a lot of effort-, it was really, uh. . . quite frankly . . . probably to the great disadvantage of the, of the Tai collaborators, uh, that I probably walked all over myself and other people in ways that I never even realized because, it was not, um, culturally; you know, people would try to help me save face even at times when it was at their own expense. And as I-, because I-I, I had, uh, was curious and I really wanted to learn more about these and had these questions. Um, you know, and because-, I think, Ouyporn always, I think one of the things she says and a lot of the local partners she says, " The thing that was so important was you kept coming back." She- 'coz she told me after I came the first time she didn't think I'd ever come back. Because they always, this happens all the time, people go and then they never come back. And, um, so as we got better acquainted and we just sat together and in really just forming-, really getting to know each other and growing to love one another, really. Ouyporn actually, quite frankly took the risk in a way to become more direct with me. And it's not-, this is the thing I guess I would wanna say. It is not that people aren't direct too at times. . . and there are these culturally sort of scripted ways that often conflict is handled or communication about conflict is handled. Like going to a third party is sometimes one of the ways that-, that that gets done and, uh, so as we've learned one of the things we've had to also figure out is we're formed and that's another reason we try to do these longer term, uh, projects with groups.So it's not just one group, one time but over time we get to know the group members as well and they get to know us. And they get more direct and willing to share. But in the mean time, the local partners we talk about how to handle situations together in ways that are culturally relevant. And this is where I really agree with our previous speaker that for me I never go in and-and, as an individual. I always go in and collaborate with people on the ground because they really are the people that know their own cultures and I've learned a lot from them about how to negotiate this. So it really-, that's a very pre-vancer(ph), because, um, a little concerned about the-the time, but, um, I think it's really crucial and thank you for bringing that one up. Yeah.
