RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker and welcome to this webcast series: 'The Emotion Revolution in the Consulting Room.’ So, what we have been doing and will continue to do through this webcast series is look at the variety of ways in which common clinicians in our field engage clients emotionally and use a client's emotional response in ways that are clinically helpful within the consulting room and one of—as we all are aware as clinicians and as human beings, one of the most prominent emotions in the hu8man repertoire is anger and, for many of us, anger is a difficult emotion to understand and to regulate. We're very fortunate today to have with us someone who's for the last 40 years has really specialized in working with angry clients, so let me take this opportunity to welcome our guest Ron Potter-Efron. Hey, Ron, how are ya? 

00:01:20
RON POTTER-EFRON I'm fine. Thanks for the invitation, Rich. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON So, Ron, what's distinctive in your experience? You're a clinician of long experience working with all kinds of clients, your specialty is the angry client—how is working with angry clients any different than working with clients for whom anger is not a primary issue? 

00:01:50
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, probably the first thing is gender. I work with a lot more men than women, which is interesting because the research doesn't indicate that men are more angry than women, but they tend to be, well, both more violent and more likely to get into trouble because of their anger, so that's a big difference because my caseload is probably 75% men. 

00:02:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:02:15
RON POTTER-EFRON Secondly, I think with anger you have to be very careful. You want people to demonstrate it, but you sure don't want them to start lavishing you with tons of their anger. The anger is one thing that is okay in small doses and in moderation and you really don't want to have people do too much of it. Third, I suppose, is almost nobody shows up for anger management without a shotgun at their back. Somebody wants, somebody is saying to that person 'you're in big trouble now, your anger is ruining our lives and things might come to an end.’ It might be a divorce is imminent, a person getting fired from their job because they're getting too angry too often at work, 'my kids won't talk to me anymore,’ and of course legally if the person has gone beyond just getting angry, our wonderful friend the Department of Probation and Parole and the like that get me a lot of clients. So, that's a mixed blessing because people come with a shotgun at their back, you have to assess pretty carefully whether they have any real internal motivation to change. 

00:03:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:03:50
RON POTTER-EFRON And angry people tend to be oppositional, so they're comin' ready to be angry with me, ready to think that this whole thing is ridiculous, that people should just let them be and, in the real world, people would honor their anger and not dishonor it, so really angry people tend to not recognize too much that this is a cooperative world that we leave in. You know, one of the things in working with the brain stuff is that there's a lot of evidence now that the reasons our brains are so big is because we have, because of our social skills, that it's the secondary emotions, the social emotions—shame and guilt and pride and stuff—that causes our brains to have to be much bigger to deal with it, so cooperation is kind of a new-brain thing and that old-fashioned aggression is much more limbic system and so I get people who you might say need to make a transition to the new-brain and my job is to help them with that, but they're kind of old-brain people and some of them grew up in really unsafe situations, so they had to develop a survival brain as against the thriving brain and that's another issue. That's where safety comes in and the need to have safety and even where longer-term therapy comes in. Traditionally in anger management, you have short-term groups and stuff and if you scratch the surface of that anger, often times you get a person who is not just angry, but really unsafe and you get fight-or-flight and I tend to think we make too big a distinction between fight-and-flight and I think most people are doing both at the same time. They analogy I use is imagine you're a soldier in Afghanistan and your group has been ambushed. If you only flee, you only throw down your gun and run; if you only fight, you only stay there until you're killed, right? If you're smart, you'll retreat and keep firing at the same time, so it's fight-and-flight for a lot of my clients. 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON So, Ron, talk to us about the early childhood experiences of people who you've seen in therapy for anger. What general statements might you make about the issue of anger and how anger was expressed in the childhood homes of these kinds of clients? 

00:06:40
RON POTTER-EFRON Sure, probably maybe half my clients just grew up in horrible, angry homes—physically aggressive sometimes, a lot of times not physically aggressive but verbally caustic, a kind of place where you never felt safe in your life, but then those are the obvious ones and often the ones you have to do the most work on and maybe trauma work, as well, but there are other people who have learned that anger works. Maybe they're alpha males or what have you—we should never forget that anger works and a lot of times there are immediate gains and secondary gains from the anger, which makes people resistant to give it up. We know in the studies on genetics, there's no single anger gene. There's certainly things like impulsivity control and genes that would help in there, but there's even one study that shows that the one allele of a gene that most predicts violence only predicts violence if the person grew up in a domestic violent home, so if you didn't grow up in a violent home, that gene would not be turned on even. So, as usual, it's a mixture of nature and nurture. 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON So when you said a moment ago 'anger works,’ fill out that statement a bit. So, it works in the sense of—what's the advantage of being angry and what is hard for the clients you see, whatever, there's the shotgun to their heads, but also they're giving up something, so what is it that they feel they're giving up if they don't resort to anger as frequently? 

00:08:25
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, they might be giving up their best friend. Anger is the emotion that sticks with them, that they can always count on, that they instantly respond with. I call it the default option of chronically angry people, so who would want to give up their best friend? And then when you give up that best friend, what are you going to replace it with? Love? 'Oh, I'm terrified of love,’ you know. Fear? Oh, hey, I'm a man, I'm not going to give in to fear,’ so you're really looking at giving up your best friend and going into a void. Now, the more obvious rewards are 'I can get what I want.’ You know, I tell some of my very nice social worker colleagues 'hey, if you want that corner office, start getting mean.’ You'll find people are terrified of anger, even angry social workers, and so you can get what you want. Others—you can get attention with you anger, you can get people to say 'oh, you poor—I know you grew up in such a terrible home, let me give you love and attention and heal your anger,’ so, yeah, there's a lot of primary and secondary gains which must be recognized. 

00:09:40
RICH SIMON But the interesting point that you made a moment ago is anger is a companion, anger is part of my narrative if I'm an angry client. 

00:09:50
RON POTTER-EFRON Yes. 

00:09:50
RICH SIMON There is some reason why I'm not getting what I want or however life is stacked against me and so part of what I may have to change if I do want to change my anger is I need to change my story. 

00:10:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah, that would be a real important thing, including an idea that at its greatest connection is 'I am my anger and my anger is me.’ It's an identity, okay? So you'd actually have to change your identity and be willing to— 

00:10:20
RICH SIMON ’Who am I if I don't have my anger?’ 

00:10:20
RON POTTER-EFRON That's right, which is quite a narrative change. 

00:10:25
RICH SIMON Oh, boy. 

00:10:25
RON POTTER-EFRON ’I've always been angry’—and, needless to say, all your friends, people, and all the people who love you identify you as that angry person, too, so in classic system format, they're not going to jump up and say 'hooray, you're not angry anymore!’ They're going to do things at an unconscious level that bring you back to anger and, speaking of an unconscious level, I'm not talking about this being a conscious decision. This happens, a person responds with anger before they even know what they're doing and I come and say 'Rich,’ you know, 'happy birthday! I brought you a cake, a chocolate cake' and your immediate response is 'yeah, exactly, chocolate? Don't you know I hate chocolate?’ 

00:11:05
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:11:05
RON POTTER-EFRON And that comes before they even recognize what they're doing, so— 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON So this is our conversation in the series here is really about practical strategies and we're going to talk about anger today, we're gonna talk more about the brain as we move into our conversation, but I'm coming to you—so you've just identified part of the difficulty here. I'm coming, I'm often, typically, I don't have a great deal of intrinsic motivation to change, I'm often wedded to my anger—my anger is me, my life story is very organized around being angry at the various obstacles that life has presented to me and it seems unfair to me and I feel entitled to my anger—so I'm coming to you in a first session and how do you begin to address these issues with me as your client? What's the initial information you want to get from me and how do you begin to address this question of my identification with my anger early on [00:!2:15]in my relationship with you as my therapist. 

00:12:10
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, I'll show you how not to do it, which is 'aw, Rich, that's too bad that you're such an angry guy. I know you don't want to be angry anymore and it must be a terrible life, so let me just help you change and just think about how serene you could be in life and what a wonderful universe we have.’ And you're sticking your thumb in your mouth and going 'ugh, this guy doesn't understand me at all. What I think you have to do at first in order to have some sort of joining process is you have to acknowledge the value of that person's anger. 

00:12:55
RICH SIMON Ah, okay. 

00:12:55
RON POTTER-EFRON Okay? Because if it's that deep, it might very well be a survival emotion and so you have to talk about how anger helped them survive. When everything was falling apart in their lives, when your father died, when you didn't know where you were going to live and people were harassing you, the only emotion you had left was anger and that helped you survive and you probably wouldn't even be here if you hadn't been able to be angry. So you poise it as 'anger has been a great friend of yours and it's sort of taken over—but the cost is, like an addiction, it's taken over your life.’ I use an analogy to imagine that anger is, that your life is like a bus and you're the bus driver. What would happen if anger took over the bus, if anger hijacks your brain and kicks you out of the driver's seat? So the idea is never to treat anger as an enemy, to treat it as an ally and make room on the bus for the other emotions. 

00:14:05
RICH SIMON Okay, so take us through—so in an initial session, I come—reluctantly in most cases, as you were saying earlier. 

00:14:15
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah, sure. Right. 

00:14:15
RICH SIMON I've told you, I've given you some information. Is there some particular, in addition to all the general information we generally like to get about people's background and at least why they decided to see us is that with an angry client, is there some information that you find particularly useful? 

00:14:35
RON POTTER-EFRON Yes, I want to know what kind of anger they have because anger is a generic term and you can't set a goal of 'I'm gonna have less anger.’ I don't want to just advertise my books, but in 'Letting Go of Anger,’ I divided anger into 11 different types, okay? 

00:15:00
RICH SIMON Wow. 

00:15:00
RON POTTER-EFRON And the two most common that bring people into therapy are sudden anger, the 'I snapped, all of a sudden I get angry, it only lasts a couple minutes and then it's over, I just can't understand why people stay upset about that’—sorry, Rich— and then the second kind is what I call habitual hostility and with habitual hostility, that's where the person has become chronically angry through-and-through in their lives. Now, you can have both of those and, like I say, there's nine other kinds like resentment, where the long-term hatred is another type, moral anger, and even anger of (inaudible ). In the old days when I first broke into therapy, when someone came in for anger, the problem was they weren't getting angry and we had to give them permission to get angry. Those people still exist, but those aren't the ones that are sent to anger management, that's for sure, so identify what kind of anger they have, how it comes out, what kind of situations trigger it, and then we have an immediate, we can develop an immediate plan to help them get quick changes because the one thing that will motivate these clients is quick success. Angry people are not patient people, so by the end of the first session, I don't want to just do an assessment—we want to come up with a plan. So, it can be a general plan or it can be very specific—‘I'm gonna go to church on Sunday because I used to when I was feeling better and I wasn't so angry' or 'I'm gonna start to use a logbook and find how many times a day I get angry' with a person with habitual anger. 'I'm going to take a time-out’—for the person with sudden anger, the single best tool is a time-out, so I want them to leave with one thing that they can use and I'm generally a proponent of finding two or three things that a person can use and stick with them, build them into the system because we know, back to the brain stuff, that it takes months and many, many practices to myelinate a new system, to get fat wrapped around these new axons that are developing so the system can become habitual and automatic, so I don't want to give them 20 different things to do, just one thing that they would do well. 

00:17:25
RICH SIMON Okay, so I'm coming in, I may not be terribly motivated, and I'm impatient, so at the end of this first session you want to make sure there's a beginning, at least, of some kind of an action plan, so your first goal is to really get a sense of what is the particular type of anger that you see so that you can begin to work on it and you mentioned (inaudible )—so you mentioned two of those. What's the profile of the most common client— 

00:18:00
RON POTTER-EFRON Person that I work with? 

00:18:00
RICH SIMON —that you work with? 

00:18:05
RON POTTER-EFRON A working-class individual who grew up in a family without a lot of social options, a lot, a lot of social skills who is coming because of a history of social violence—I mean, I'm sorry, of anger that sometimes actually leads to violence but more often just makes life miserable for other people and sometimes they also come in with a sense that 'it's making life miserable for me and I don't want to do that anymore' or, you know, then we don't have to deal with motivation stuff. Also, they're coming in with a chip on their shoulder and they're ready to to see you as an enemy. 

00:18:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:18:45
RON POTTER-EFRON So in addition to the planning, then if there's one other key word, it's 'respect.’ You must show respect to these people because they are often very disrespected in life. 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm. 

00:19:00
RON POTTER-EFRON They do not— I'm not talking about, if you're asking me about my average client, I'm not talking about a $70,000 a year executive who's coming in and taking off his coat and tie, I'm talking about a guy who's scrambling to exist in a working-class life, maybe just got his job back after being out of work, has a zillion stressors in their life which, of course, are adding to their anger, and feel disrespected by their spouses, by their bosses, by the legal system, and by others and I have to show them I'm not gonna be one of those people, I respect you as a human being, and I know we have to— 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON And the way you do that—and so the way that you communicate that is— 

00:19:50
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, I let them talk about how they have been abused by the system, et cetera. I don't try to cut all of that off or argue with them or make the other point, I explain to them that we need to come up with something that makes sense to them, not to their wife, not to their mother, not to the boss, but something they are really interested in working in and by the end of the hour, I hope to have them realize that I'm not an enemy and it really sounds simple, but you're dealing mostly with people who are coming in with fear issues and life stress middle-class issues that they don't come in thinking you're an enemy, they come in thinking you're ready to help them. My angry clients—even my so-called 'volunteer' clients—come in with the assumption that I'm not a friend and so I have to undo that kind of stuff very quickly because I won't see them a second time if they perceive me as an enemy. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON Sure, okay. 

00:21:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Or they will come and just BS, you know. They'll tell me what they think I need to hear so I'll get off their back. 

00:21:10
RICH SIMON So how do we move from—so you get a sense of who I am in the world and that I'm living in a sea of anger and resentment and feeling disrespected and feeling like the world is out to get me and perhaps I'm getting into a lot of conflicts with my wife because I feel like she doesn't, I take what she may well not at this stage have a lot of respect for me because I'm raging so much and I have such poor self-control, so we have all of that. So how do we—you get a flavor of that, you get a sense of how my style of anger, how it fits into my social and economic circumstances, so how do we move from that to, by the end of the session, having this action plan of some kind? 

00:22:00
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, I do the assessment with those anger styles. I can show them how that shows up and how they don't usually have all these different kinds of anger, they have very specific kinds of anger. I can get them giving examples of that and then the crucial question: 'do you want to change this or how much do you want to change this?’ And we're looking by then at the cost as well as the benefits of that system and because at least they're (inaudible ), most of them will say 'yes, I do want to change that,’ so, fortunately, I mean, it's one of those things that are very clear. If it's sudden anger, I send them home with a chapter on that to read, I give them a key like taking a time-out, and we schedule another session and they come back the next week and I'll find out have they read the chapter, have they done the assignment and, if they haven't, I know that another anger style is passive-aggression and we're really gonna have a hard time with them. But what I've got goin' for me is chances are they will have success because once an angry person quits being so angry, people come toward them. What they don't realize is anger pushes people away, so 'I want you to love me, I just want respect, I want people to come and talk with me, but I treat 'em like crap,’ so once they realize that 'hey, I'm not treating them like crap and, you know what? My wife actually came and gave me a hug, my kids had a little conversation with me.’ I had a guy recently, he said 'it's hard to believe but my co-workers are actually talking to me!’ And it only took a week or two to do it. With this habitual anger, they don't realize how often they are off-putting to other people and if they can stop doing that, they will get rewarded quite quickly. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Exactly. 

00:24:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Okay, so let's assume that that happened. They come to the second session and they've had some success—now we're ready to expand from just a straight mechanical issue—‘here's take a time-out' and do that stuff—more to the personality issues that I might give them that 'bus of your life' analogy and help them realize how anger has taken over their lives if that's true and now we're at the point where I say 'Rich,’—maybe second, third, fourth session, somewhere in there—‘Rich, I've given you a few tools now, but we could go deeper, we could do more. How much do you want not to have anger running your life?’ 

00:24:50
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm. 

00:24:50
RON POTTER-EFRON And I very seldom have a person say 'I like my anger so much I want to keep them as my best friend, see ya later, buddy' because by then they're starting to realize 'I don't have to do this, this doesn't have to be my whole life.’ And so now you can recruit them into the larger task of brain change and real long-term life change, change in the narrative, change in the actual behavior, change in the whole way they deal with life because one of my principles that I really emphasize with them is it's never enough to quit being angry. That's not a goal—the goal is to lessen the number of times you're angry and to replace it with something and I always ask the person 'if you were to give up some of this anger time—maybe you spend about an hour a day being angry—what would you replace it with?’ And, inevitably, the answer is 'I don't know' because they don't know and they can't know and then we start to talk about it. We talk about 'well, do you know people who aren't angry? What do they do in their lives?’ And so you go from trying to stop a negative behavior to starting and developing a positive behavior and that's where real change takes place, when they are building up a new neural network of positive behaviors and having success doing it. 

00:26:20
RICH SIMON So let's slow it down for a second because what we were saying at the beginning was the difficulty was I'm coming in and often I'm identifying—I am my anger. I wouldn't express it in that way, I don't, it's not something that I consciously formulated, but I operate in the world as if that's the case. So I come in and that's the beginning of the difficulty of this task of working with somebody who's not terribly motivated because if I give it up, who am I? What have I been doing for 30, 40, 50-plus years? 

00:26:55
RON POTTER-EFRON Right. 

00:26:55
RICH SIMON So to make that pivot which seemed to me even if I'd had a success or two or a time-out or I've begun to kind of come up with an alternative behavior or two, that would seem to me a very tricky moment in working with people who are not coming in because they have such vast psychological curiosity, they don't have some growth agenda. 

00:27:20
RON POTTER-EFRON Sure. 

00:27:20
RICH SIMON So tell us, take us a little in to—and maybe if you could think of a particular case—where somebody made that. How do you make that turn? 

00:27:30
RON POTTER-EFRON Well— 

00:27:30
RICH SIMON —in your experience. 

00:27:35
RON POTTER-EFRON Yes, I'm thinking of a guy—I'll call him Simon, okay? Which is not his name. 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON You can see right through me, Ron. (inaudible ) clinician by training. 

00:27:46
RON POTTER-EFRON I just came up with that name out of the blue here. Simon's a large man well over 60, well over 250 pounds, angry, both angry and very, very anxious, which is not an unusual combination. His anxiety triggers bouts of anger, his anger leads to negative consequences which make him more anxious, okay? He came in very dubious and not willing to give up his protections against the world, his defenses against all the people who were out to get him and all the things that he did and all his anger flare-ups. So I work with him in probably five or six weeks, not just one week, and we started to convert this and get some success. He really needed a lot of help with breathing techniques and relaxation because of his anxiety, but what he discovered is as he did his breathing techniques and stuff that that helped him buy time to help him deal with his anger issues. Then, at a certain point, I was able to talk to him about how anger and anxiety together, to be honest, had controlled his life and we went back, we did some family of origin stuff about how that was so necessary for him growing up to feel safe and to use anger to push people away and then I talked to him quietly and gently, as I think you have to do it in this case, and basically have to say 'it looks to me like you're suffering. It looks to me like your life is not as good as it could be. You're paying such a price for your anger and I respect your anger, I understand it's necessary, I will never ask you to give up all your anger, but do you want and need to explore what your life would be like if you weren't so angry and you weren't so anxious?’ And that—and so then, yeah, you sort of do a 'close your eyes and speculate and just wish' and I think he had never really even thought that he could have a life free from anger and anxiety. But as he did that and we cracked the breathing and the other techniques and people started to get nicer to him, he started spontaneously bringing into therapy these positive things that were happening to him that he started to get really anxious about something that his girlfriend had done—had not called him when she said—and in the past he would've gotten anxious, jealous, and then angry in turn—one, two, three—and he caught himself and he said 'gosh, I counted to five.’ We had told him to count to ten and typically he hadn't heard a thing and he discovered on his own 'if I count to five, I can buy enough time and I relaxed a little bit, I wasn't so anxious, and I didn't snap at her when she came home,’ so then you start—it's a gradual process and all the time reassuring the person 'you don't have to give up more than you need to, you want to. You'll always have anger waiting to help you defend yourself if you need to, so it's not a you have to leave that behind and go to the next thing—‘ 

00:31:35
RICH SIMON No unilateral disarmament. 

00:31:35
RON POTTER-EFRON Right, exactly, more like a truce. 'Let's call a truce and let's start negotiating.’ And then what's beautiful is when they start becoming friends with their other emotions, you know? It's kind right-brain, left-brain. Anger is such a right-brain emotion and the positive emotions, joy and happiness and contentment and stuff, Simon, he didn't understand, he [32:05]didn't—we could talk about that. He hardly ever felt those things and it took—I'm not gonna kid you—it took about four, five months before he started to report that he actually could feel periods of contentment, where there was no, where the anxiety wasn't even in the background—it had actually left—and he found times when he wasn't angry and wasn't nursing any hostility anymore. It was so self-rewarding. 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON So, about that transition—so, two things are standing out to me about what you're saying: so, one is that conversation that you had with him, that kind of negotiation that you had with this fellow sounds like, typically, 'I'm not going to take away your anger, let's look at the price that you're paying for the way in which your anger has taken over your life.’ 

00:32:55
RON POTTER-EFRON Exactly. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Is that you want to renegotiate that bargain and so that's kind of a turning-point conversation, I would assume, with lots of your clients. 

00:33:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Yes. 

00:33:05
RICH SIMON And you begin to talk about that and then the tough part, it would seem, is 'what's your life going to be like?’ So if you begin to regulate your anger—not blow off, count to five, whatever it is and maybe you'll have some other things you want to tell us in a practical way about how you help people make that transition. How does that transition into experiencing a more normal range—a broader range, at least—of human emotion, how does that happen for these guys? And it's primarily guys in your practice. 

00:33:45
RON POTTER-EFRON In bits and pieces. It happens slowly and two steps forward, one step back, sometimes one step forward, two steps back. The most difficult situations occur when the person encounters opposition from—spouses, family or origin, people who are invested in that person staying the scapegoat in the family or the angry person because then they're not getting rewarded as much and sometimes it's like giving up alcohol: you have to make some good friends and you may even have to give up your girlfriend or your husband—because I do work with women. I mean, it's not like women don't get angry or anything like that and so, in that case, there's less rewards and finally you get to the internal thing: 'am I willing to pay even that price in order to feel better inside myself, in order to get this anger back as a passenger on the bus of my life?’ And some people can do that. I think some people drop out of counseling at that time because they run into so much resistance. 

00:35:00
RICH SIMON A considerable amount I would think would do that. Lots of people drop out under any circumstance, but they intertwine for all the reasons we've discussed earlier, in particular would be drop-outs. 

00:35:10
RON POTTER-EFRON I try to ask them: 'who will be resistant? Who wants you to stay angry in your life and why?’ 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON Put it beyond them into their system of (inaudible ). 

00:35:27
RON POTTER-EFRON That's right. That's absolutely right, and then you also get other people's unconscious issues, too. I mean, just because Rich changes his behavior and becomes Mr. Nice Guy doesn't mean they're not going to see everything that Rich does as the work of a total jerk. I mean, they're going to reinterpret that nice smile that you just had as a sneer of arrogance and stuff and so there's a lag. I tell people you've got to figure that it would take up to a year before people in your life really recognize— 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON Oh, really? You'll be that concrete about it? 

00:36:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah, yeah. The people closest to you hopefully will notice the fastest and as you go to outer circles, your family that only visits on Christmas and actually because you were so pissed off at them you didn't visit them the last three Christmases, they're going to come expecting you to be a royal jerk and even— 

00:36:25
RICH SIMON Okay, so here's—so here's the tricky part. Here's the introduction: someone's coming in with some momentum of creating change, often it's external, you get a sense of this, you're the ally with the person, you're careful to be respectful, you're very careful to honor the role the anger has played in their life, you begin to, in a tentative way, see if they're willing to experiment with if they give up some of that expression of anger, what happens? Then, it feels like, from what you're describing, it's a somewhat unpredictable process at that point—there's some new habits, new practices, perhaps, that you instruct them in, perhaps their life changes in some ways that encourage them in that direction, maybe there are some setbacks. 

00:37:15
RON POTTER-EFRON Right. 

00:37:15
RICH SIMON So here's the point I would think—and here's where the focus of your focus—this understanding about the brain and how you've begun to bring into your therapy in more recent years and you've just written a book which we'll talk to people about at the end. So, how does that play into what you're trying to do as you're sketching out, helping people get more control over their expression of their anger and to begin to see more, explore more choices in life? 

00:37:50
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, in a couple ways. You and I have talked about it being a motivational guide that people gain hope and optimism because we can show them that the brain does change and Simon, the guy I was talking about, he read my book twice because he was so excited about 'hey, this works! This can actually change' and before that he had been told so many times 'you're always going to be angry. You're never going to have control over this.’ He'd been told that by anger management counselors! He'd been at previous anger management programs and failed them. So part of it's motivation, part of it is understanding and there's also this goal that I'm saying to Simon 'our goal Is clear: we want you to get so good at these positive tools—giving praise, breathing easily, saying things like 'no big deal’—that you don't have to think about it anymore, that what started off in the cerebrum, I guess, transferred to the cerebellum.’ What started out as unmyelinated axons become myelinated and the turning point is when they come to me in my office and they say 'you know, I don't have to work at this anymore.’ I just did an evaluation of one guy, I had him write down and one of the questions was 'are you still working’—this was after six months—‘are you still working on your brain change plan?’ And his answer is 'no, I don't have to work on it anymore; it comes automatically.’ And then I know and they know that this is not going to fade. This is behavior that has become habitual, automatic, and it's in their unconscious, not just their conscious system. They don't have to think about it anymore. 

00:39:50
RICH SIMON Okay, so this is like Henry Higgins. 'You're second nature to me now, I'm breathing out and breathing in.’ 

00:40:00
RON POTTER-EFRON Absolutely. 

00:40:00
RICH SIMON You wanted me to sing, so— 

00:40:00
RON POTTER-EFRON I did want you to sing. 

00:40:00
RICH SIMON So now we can move on with the video. So when you talk about the 'brain change technique' and the 'brain change plan,’ tell us about what is a 'brain change plan' and how does that figure now in your work with your anger clients? 

00:40:15
RON POTTER-EFRON Okay, I do this in groups to try to individualize it. I need to help people get past their oppositionality, which is because people are telling them they have to change and how to change, and I want to individualize treatment even in a group setting, so we tell them that—I explain to them what brain change is and how it happens. Then, I give them a handout—well, I give many, many examples of how a person changes their brain. Then, I give them a handout: 'come in next week with your own personalized brain change plan and defend it to the group.’ And these are angry people, remember, so if you're going to defend it to a bunch of angry people, sarcastic, cynical people, you better have a good plan in mind and so they come in and they have to name the plan, it has to be specific, they have to— 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON Take a step back for us for a second. So, what is a 'brain change plan?’ Is that different than a behavior change plan or anybody setting up goals or something? 

00:41:25
RON POTTER-EFRON It's a behavioral change plan that they can buy into and understand that they will have to stick to it for probably six months in order to make effective, long-term change. I explain to them that one of the failures in anger management is that our programs are too short, that they get a surface level of change, and it doesn't get in deep enough to make a real change. So, no, it looks like a behavioral plan, but it has a much deeper and longer commitment to it, plus which I explain to them that first you start to build the plan—I mean, you start to build the plan, you start to build the first few things that are most necessary. 'I've been really cynical and sarcastic' may be what a person, what a main type of anger— 

00:42:15
RICH SIMON Let me just stop you right there so people can follow. So, what literally am I doing? Here's my behavior change plan or my brain change plan. What are you asking me to do? What is the instruction? 

00:42:25
RON POTTER-EFRON What I'm asking you to do is to name the plan, [p00:42:30]write down how you're going to start the plan—which includes the first few behavioral things that you're going to do— 

00:42:35
RICH SIMON So is the first question 'what aspects of your behavior do you want to change or are willing to change—?’ 

00:42:40
RON POTTER-EFRON No, we've talked about that by then, we've introduced that whole idea. My assumption at this point is here is your opportunity to take control of your life, so it's not oppositional, we're not telling you what to do. For the next six months, you, you are in control of this. You'll have to defend it, you'll have to show how it's related to anger management, so they don't always have to be 'I'm going to take a time-out.’ It could be 'I'm going to quit drinking,’ but even that's not enough alone. That's not a brain change plan, that's just one item. So then they have to in writing put down how they're going to start, they have to in writing indicate if that works, how will they continue so that—you start the brain plan, the second stage is you improve it, which is the— 

00:43:30
RICH SIMON Stay in the first stage there because I'm still not following it. So, I'm not exactly sure—what am I, what exactly am I putting down? Just be more concrete with us. What's the assignment? 

00:43:40
RON POTTER-EFRON I'm rushing ahead here. 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON It's okay. 

00:43:40
RON POTTER-EFRON Let's say that the person says 'my goal: I have been really cynical and sarcastic. I want to quit doing that and I want to substitute being able to five praise to people,’ okay? Probably, they'd just say 'I want to quit being so cynical and sarcastic,’ so then— 

00:44:05
RICH SIMON So, typically it begins with what I'm going to stop doing. That's the seed of it. 

00:44:10
RON POTTER-EFRON Exactly. 

00:44:10
RICH SIMON But that's not a plan yet. That's just a— 

00:44:10
RON POTTER-EFRON That's the name of the plan and the immediate first goal. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON Okay, that's—okay. 

00:44:15
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah, and then they have to name some specific behaviors that would go with that. For instance, I'm going to instead of planning my immediate negative response when somebody is talking to me, I'm going to take the time to listen to them and then I'm going to think about it before I respond. I'm going to follow the rules for praise which I give them, which are basically there's a four-step process: 'shut your mouth' is the first step; 'quit thinking negative thoughts’; 'start thinking positive thoughts, praiseful thoughts’; and then 'open your mouth,’ so they have those kinds of things. Then—so, now can I go on to the second phase? 

00:45:00
RICH SIMON Okay, just so I get it, so people, typically your clients, particularly anger clients, there's something they're going to start, they'll stop to start. You're saying 'okay, instead of that, what are you going to do instead?’ That's often your input in terms of developing their plan and that's part of what you work out with them. Am I following that so far? 

00:45:20
RON POTTER-EFRON Yup. 

00:45:25
RICH SIMON Okay, all right— 

00:45:25
RON POTTER-EFRON Then, it becomes more speculative. The next item on the plan is 'if this succeeds, how will you improve it or continue to help your plan grow?’ So the person, you know, would say 'if, for instance, I could quit being so cynical and sarcastic and start giving praise, then maybe I would learn how to do some of that volunteer work that I have often asked to do. I wanted to work with animals at the Human Society and they turned me down, I think it was because of my attitude,’ so it doesn't necessarily have to be a one-to-one correlation or something that's really obvious; what's important is that it makes sense to them and we know from brain work that as a person works in one area, the myelinization in parts starts to take place, but also arborization(ph), which means that the axons start to make more and more connections with other networks, so one network leads to another and so going from giving praise and being, give praise to people might go into doing volunteer work, helping other people, be more generous would be another— 

00:46:50
RICH SIMON The other possibilities are going to open up once anger isn't putting a brake on the riding the bus analogy, so new things are opening up. Okay. 

00:47:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Okay, so now I can even get off the bus and get onto a motorcycle, another thing. And then there's a third level which is beyond that: 'how would you expand and just keep going? What would your ultimate hopes be to change your life?’ So we go from a narrow focus, we widen it, broaden it further and further, and then they understand if it's a group that these plans will be reviewed on a monthly basis; if I'm doing individual counseling, that they're going to be reviewed on a regular basis, maybe even every week with the client and then, of course, the proof is in the pudding. A month later, have they actually started the plan or not? If they have, chances are they've been talking about it all along. A couple people in the last group I ran, they came back after a month and said 'I need a new plan, this one just isn't working' and that was good because they were able to be honest about it instead of pretending for six months that they were doing it. 

00:48:10
RICH SIMON Now, but you introduced this as a 'brain change plan,’ so how much discussion of the brain, the mechanisms of the brain do you have with your anger clients and what makes this plan you're referring to as a 'brain change plan,’ how do you talk about it? Because it sounds you're talking about goals and behavior change. I'm not quite sure yet where the brain comes in. 

00:48:40
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah, where the brain comes in is to help them understand that this is not just a behavior change. This is not just that they are changing what they're doing on the outside; this is a change that they're doing on the inside. I present it conceptually, I give a couple lectures on the brain, but what I've found is if you go into too much detail, you know, the eyes start to roll. That's not— 

00:49:05
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) are like that, also. 

00:49:08
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah. 

00:49:08
RICH SIMON We like the brain, but a little goes a long way. 

00:49:10
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah. Oh, gosh, I was giving this one talk to an anger group and I started talking about how the thalamus, when you get angry, the message goes from the thalamus to the amygdala and then to the hypothalamus and then to the PAG and I'm getting all excited and I'm lookin' around and they're just bored out of their minds. They don't need or want that information. If they want it, they can go and read it in my book, but what they want is— 

00:49:40
RICH SIMON The idea of the brain change, then, what you're saying is you're talking about behavior but that it gives them a sense of control, there's a sense that you can really, in a concrete way, when you're doing these behaviors, they don't just evaporate; something's happening internally that's enduring, you're building on it from week to week to week. 

00:50:00
RON POTTER-EFRON Absolutely, and for you and me that might be obvious, but for a lot of my clients, it's not obvious at all; they've never thought about actually changing what's going on inside their heads and then I give them reassurance that this is a permanent change. You can make a permanent change. The rest of your life will be better because of that and I can't promise—if I teach someone to do a behavioral plan taking time-outs, I can't make any of those promises. All I'm changing is their superficial behavior. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm, okay. 

00:50:35
RON POTTER-EFRON So when we're talking about in-depth treatment, how much deeper can you go than the person's brain? 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON So, okay, and what you were saying earlier is one thing that's really consistent with our understanding of the brain—however rudimentary for most of us it may be—the idea of repetition and change over time, particularly with a habit like getting angry, so a real important thing that brain science has reinforced for you from what I was hearing earlier was that short-term attempts to change anger patterns of anger expression and anger management are doomed. 

00:51:15
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, they're unlikely to be successful. Let's not go so far as to say 'doomed.’ If you got lucky, if in that ten-week program you got lucky and hit just the right chord and that person became self-motivated, eureka! I found it! Then, you may have gotten to that might work, but if you really want to—basically, this is a grind it out. Working with the brain is a grinder, a grinding process. It's not fast, it's not especially insightful because what we're working with so much is unconscious process rather than— 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON And habit and repetition! It's like athletic skill. 

00:52:00
RON POTTER-EFRON Absolutely. 

00:52:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:52:00
RON POTTER-EFRON To get to the point where the equivalent of motor memory for basketball players— 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Emotional memory. 

00:52:10
RON POTTER-EFRON Yeah. 

00:52:10
RICH SIMON Now, a moment ago, we started —you're saying that the majority of your clients are male but you've pointed out a couple of times that you also work with women who have problems with anger. Are there some differences in how you work in the way in which men and women respond to your techniques, the ways in which the kinds of anger problem that they have? 

00:52:45
RON POTTER-EFRON I don't have, you know, mathematical models or research to base it. 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON Impressionistically, what's (inaudible )? 

00:52:55
RON POTTER-EFRON I think that more of the— for a woman to come to anger management problems and especially if it also happens to be domestic violence problems, they have to be a lot angrier or violent than a guy, okay? They have to really stand out in terms of 'this is’—one woman I'm working with right now, she's a very nice woman, quite attractive, has a responsible position, but one of the first things she says is 'I don't have empathy. I'm not an empathic person!’ 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm. 

00:53:30
RON POTTER-EFRON Matter of fact, she said something like 'the reason I'm here to see you is I can't understand why I haven't just shoved that guy out of my life' and her problem wasn't that her anger, per se, it was that she wasn't even able to use her aggression effectively in this particular case. I find that they're more angry, are more resentful—the women I work with often carry long-term resentments because of the prohibition in American society against women being angry, so they have less right to be assertive and, because of that, they stuff their anger more, so you have stuff below stuff, you have angry and resentments, you have to the extent that the depression and anger are linked through low serotonin, which is related to both impulsive anger and aggression. You're likely to see women kind of willing to say they have multiple problems, not just anger but other things there, as well. A man coming in, their first approach is 'give me the tools and I'll fix it.’ 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:54:45
RON POTTER-EFRON And the woman is much more— maybe because of their greater carpus collosums(ph) or something—much more integrate a holistic approach. They're more willing to say 'fix me as whole, help me fix myself as a whole person,’ which is what we have to move toward with men. 

00:55:05
RICH SIMON Okay. Now, we've been focusing primarily here on the client, on techniques and tools, the expression of anger, the various styles of anger management difficulties that people bring to you. What's— we're coming to the end here. We just have a few more minutes, so what is it in your training and supervision of other therapists: if we're going to be helpful to people in learning how to deal with their anger, what's tough for therapists in doing this kind of work and what is it that we need to learn in addition to understanding the brain, perhaps, and learning some techniques and methods? 

00:55:45
RON POTTER-EFRON I can tell you the number one thing: embrace their anger. 

00:55:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:55:50
RON POTTER-EFRON not be afraid of their anger, do not be put off by their anger, do not back away from their anger—don't approach it either because that can get you in big trouble! But, you know, stand your grand, treat their anger as a friend and an ally instead of an enemy because I think our society is angerphobic. 

00:56:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:56:15
RON POTTER-EFRON Okay? 

00:56:15
RICH SIMON And so how do we do that? So, I mean, in principle, I agree with that, the idea that anger is your friend as long as it's not always driving the bus makes a lot of sense—at least in certain situations you need to call upon that—so in terms of how you actually work with people, what have you learned that is helpful in addition to that general directive and that guideline that helps people become more comfortable when they can see somebody's shoulders are rising and they're getting, a client's getting into his or her anger in their office? Are there—what is it you have found that's helpful for you to do in your supervision and training with therapists and helping them to become more effective? 

00:57:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, breathe. 

00:57:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:57:05
RON POTTER-EFRON Remember that you're in control, that you can always—I tell the people that I supervise, you can fire your clients. They have no right to disrespect you. They can be angry, but at a certain point you have to kick them out of your office— 

00:57:25
RICH SIMON —in your own space, so limits in your office. 

00:57:25
RON POTTER-EFRON Well, absolutely. Some people, some of the people I've supervised have some real individual issues with either they grew up in a really angry family or they grew up in a nicey-nice family where anger was never expressed and they just don't know what to do with all that anger— 

00:57:45
RICH SIMON Yeah, I would think so. 

00:57:45
RON POTTER-EFRON —person, so you have to work with the individual person's capabilities and capacities. Because I grew up being really angry, I'm not afraid of anger, right? But I also don't hold it in awe and obviously don't reward it. In the therapy room, do not reward a person's anger by backing away, by talking to them, by telling them that they are a better—or, I'm sorry, by giving in to their anger. 

00:58:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:58:20
RON POTTER-EFRON Just treat their anger respectfully, treat them respectfully. If you have issues, if their anger scares you, then you better go and do some therapy or figure out what is going on in your life. 

00:58:35
RICH SIMON So in a situation with you're working with a client or someone's coming to you for supervision, you have an angry client, the anger is simmering, and there's a point where they feel repeatedly it's coming up to the line or threshold where the therapist is feeling uncomfortable with the anger, what's the kind of—will you do a role-play with them? How will you coach them about how to handle that situation with that client who is not so obviously out-of-bounds that they might feel where it's ambiguous that they have to set the limit in their office, but what's the kind of coaching that you do with that therapist that's going to help them to feel more effective and have a clearer sense of their own therapeutic boundaries? 

00:59:25
RON POTTER-EFRON With a situation now, I try to encourage the person I'm supervising to challenge the client, to move toward them in that way, to tell them that she sees behavior of the client, sees that's probably habitual behavior the person is not even aware of is how they're defending themselves with their aggression, with their verbage and that is not going to work with her and to invite—but at the same time inviting the person to calm down, to sit down, and to above all listen to their complaint. If I'm, you know, if I'm screaming at you and screaming at you 'this isn't fair! Why do they do this to me?’ and all of that stuff, if I can, if you can say to me 'Ron, I hear— if I'm hearing you right, the thing that's bothering you most is.’ Then, that person will calm down and all the rest of the stuff becomes superfluous. You have to, you have to show the client that you're hearing them even though they're loud and stuff. If you can't, I have told clients 'I would like to hear you, I really am interested in what you're trying to tell me, but I cannot hear you because you're yelling so much.’ 

01:00:55
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. 

01:00:55
RON POTTER-EFRON I tell that to my clients, too. You have to show an interest in them as a human being while not allowing the anger to take over the session. 

01:01:05
RICH SIMON Okay, and so with a client who really has trouble keeping control in your office and where you feel like you're really very strongly have to draw a line with them, that you've given a somewhat language to it, but if somebody even pushes it beyond that, what's the kind of thing that you might say to such a client where they really seem that they've gotten out of control in your office and you feel like you really just have to draw the line with them? 

01:01:35
RON POTTER-EFRON I'd say 'goodbye!’ I mean, at some point I will give them a warning, saying 'if you continue this behavior, then I'm going to ask you or tell you to leave' and I've only, I think I've only had to do that maybe three times in 30 years because I'm not their enemy. They get nothing by blasting me in the long-term and I can tell them that 'look, I'm not your enemy and I'm small. Nobody gets any status points by beating me up or anything,’ so it's very rare. You just have to establish it. We just ended a group and the feedback we got—there were four of us doing therapy in this group and the feedback we got is [you respected us, we didn't feel like you were pushing anything down our throats, and that's why we listened to you.’ 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON Okay. All right, well, that seems like a nice note for us. We're out of time here, but what we would like to do is make sure that the people who have been listening to you present your work know how to follow up with you—get other learning resources, other training opportunities, perhaps read some of your books and other material that you've written. Where do they go? 

01:02:55
RON POTTER-EFRON My website is www.potter-efron.com. 

01:03:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:03:00
RON POTTER-EFRON And that's a pretty new website and I'd love people to go on just so I know that it actually works and, of course, my books are available on Amazon and the like and I'm actually in Altoona, Wisconsin, and you can—I'll give you a phone number: (715) 832-8432 and you can call me there. 

01:03:20
RICH SIMON Say it one more time so it gets into people's memories. 

01:03:20
RON POTTER-EFRON (715) 832-8432. 

01:03:20
RICH SIMON Okay, great. All right, and then, again, a reminder to everybody: as we've said throughout the series, here's the comment board, here's a chance for you to crystallize what you've learned out of this conversation, what stood out for you, with your learning furthering out the conversation and furthering the entire group. Take a moment now to make your contribution to the comment board. Ron has agreed to take a look at the comment board and may or may not respond as he is so moved but, in any case, he will be looking over the responses and the important thing, really, once our conversation here is done is the ripple effect of this conversation and how it spreads out into the therapeutic community. Ron, thank you so much for spending this time with us and outlining this work that you've been doing for three decades now. 

01:04:25
RON POTTER-EFRON Thank you. 

01:04:25
RICH SIMON Impressive, informative, important work. Thank you so much. 

01:04:30
RON POTTER-EFRON welcome. Thank you for the opportunity. 

01:04:35
RICH SIMON And that's it for right now. See you next time. Rich Simon here from Networker Webcast. Bye-bye. 

01:04:40
Psychotherapy Networker Your source for community, learning and excellence Thank you!
