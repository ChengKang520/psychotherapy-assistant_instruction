ROCKEY R. ROBBINS What she(ph) saw was a utter contradiction, when I grad asked for a watch, here, but as (inaudible ) says, in one place he says that, if you want to experience eternity, you have to throw your watches out of the windows and that’s what we are gonna to do, we are gonna experience the eternity here. A little bit of it anyway. So, hope you can you hear me alright? Umm. Thank you, Gel(ph). It’s go great seeing Gel(ph) again and I’m blind as a bat so I can’t see very well Marie and I worked for a few years and it was wonderful to work with, with her and Andrea and (inaudible ), so great seeing you again. It’s wonderful to be here. Now, go ahead and get started here. This is probably a little bit different kind of talk than you’ll hear in most… in most places because we are gonna be dealing with the this dialogue with this medicine man and myself and it’s umm… in many ways very personal… personal thing for me I… because it’s a part of what my spirituality is. And so I’m sort of in this circle of what… of… of what I’m talking of, I mean in the circle of what this medicine man((ph)) is gonna be talking about. So, I don’t have the outside objective opinion probably that some… some people here might like, like better. But you know, I think it’s time for psychology to kind of get back to it’s connections with spirituality. You know, originally psyche and psychology, psyche originally mean that the study of the soul, but this original meaning has been lost to a great extend in western psychotherapy. But the word was originally Greek word for healing and that sort of… that’s what I’m gonna be talking to you about. And know it’s not (inaudible ) know you read Maslow and Maslow talks about peak experiences and you read Carl Jung and Carl Jung talks about occult concepts, esoteric and occult concepts and if you read some of those West Coast transpersonal psychologist, they talk about many of the kind of things that I’m gonna be talking about. Here also some Christian people that are doing things on spirituality as well. But I don’t think this will sound too much any of those things, because this is very unique. It’s a very unique, the spirituality I’m gonna talking to you about. Umm… Now, I think it can benefit us if we can humble ourselves enough we might to have faith in this last empirical perspective that he offers and try to explore what similar beliefs you have but not at the expands of… of civilizing (inaudible ) and the things he has to say. If we can hold this otherness as something of value long enough, we might be just be able to result(ph) something out of that and expand the way we look at things. First of all, I did the method was the single case study. It demanded to be qualitative approach and I don’t wanna go talk about this too much because I’ve so many things to talk to you about today but I went on and I interviewed him ten times, each time about an hour, at a time. I didn’t go in with pre-planned questions; it was open ended for him to go where he wanted in regards to spiritual healing. Umm… I can tell you a little bit about Whitebear but not very much, he won’t let me and so, he made me take out some of this stuff. A lot of people think Whitebear as a high olka(ph). You know high olka(ph) is in the… among the Lakota is the person, he or she is the person that’s the contrary. If you ever meet a high olka(ph), they will reach out like this to shake hands backwards. They might wash their hair in sand and if they walk up to you they’ll go. They will say something like, good bye or they might say, it’s really bad meeting you and they do these things in like contraries. Well, he says he is not, a high olka(ph). But he makes a comment; he says most people think I see things backwards. I see things most of the time from a no time, no space perspective. Well, most people see from a time and space perspective. So, to say he’ll see things for no time, no space perspective suggests that he is only connected to the body. He listen spiritual dimension. Umm… when I asked him about spirits, Umm… which we will be talking about and his work with spirits, he says that he sees energy, “I see energy literally, this includes seeing spirits or little people. I wouldn’t be able to see them if I looked at you as having stopped, if I judged you. Once you look,” I think speaking to me, he says, “once you open your eyes and see the gifts and all things, you will see the energy too. And you don’t… and you don’t stop with the gift either. You gotta keep on wondering, all pure energy in time and space comes from no time, no space,” this is what he said. So, he offered the possibility that I too could see spirits eventually, but it wouldn’t be possible unless I enter the eternal now. That means if you are sitting and you are thinking when did the hell is he’s gonna finish and you are not right here with me, right now, you know I gonna see the spirits and if you also are making judgments toward anyone, you’ll not see the invisible world. You have to see the gifts, not see the gifts, you have to wonder about the gifts of every incident in our life and every human being that you meet in order to see the invisible world and he said, "I haven't done that" yeah, but he suggested that's the way I might do it someday and he went on to say that these experiences are too intense for most of people. Still he said he didn’t see himself a special in the list. In fact, he had many times during his life wished that the others had this instead of him. Like other Shaman, Whitebear experienced horrific times through his life journey. Umm… he repeatedly spoke of his station as a heal… healer is being involuntary and like other healers spiritual healers he describes, his deep contact with animal spirits but then he adds you know they are not really animal spirits, damn sure(ph), that's what all the white people think about us medicine dealing with (inaudible ). He said they just have those qualities that we identify with certain animals. They are really spiritual entities, wise energy in to these, that he calls the animals, he call some by animal names to me. Like other healers he spontaneously creates healing rituals which are similar to those practice by Shaman in other parts of the world too and other cultures. For instance, when you go… umm… sweat ceremonies are very important to me, their sun dance is very important to me, (inaudible ) recent quest have very been, very been really important part of my life and when you do these with him as the person leading it, it’s not exactly like a lot of those people who claim to be very, very traditional. When you are in there with him you don’t know exactly what’s gonna happen. It may be conducted just like traditional sweat ceremonies. But then you might go in there sometimes and all of a sudden he will began to chant which you never heard before in your life, that the little people will be telling him to lead (inaudible ) while we are in there, it will happen in a totally spontaneous way. Or you’ll be sitting there and he’ll start throwing water on you. Just all of the sudden, just start throwing water on you or he will speak messages that come from the spirits, just out to you, will say things the spirits said da…da…da… and he will name the person. Sometimes he’ll even see ancestors spirits and will talk and say what they have to say to different people. But the thing that it does, it constantly keeps you in the eternal now. If you think you are gonna get locked in to doing in the first round they are calling in of the spirits from the four directions and if you think that’s where it’s got to be and you are expecting it, that’s when he will surprise you and puts you in the eternal now. In the second round, if you go in there and you think okay, this is the prayer round and this is what we’ve got to do then he will surprise you something else. Not always, sometimes he will just do it the straight way of doing it. But like so many great healers in the past, he acts spontaneously. Sometimes it is really frightening to people. He can be so spontaneous. When we dance, we dance every two weeks. He will sometimes, ahh… he will become the bear, that’s the one he becomes typically and he will make the sounds of a grey bear, he will move like a bear and he will dance with the bears during the dance. The dances are healing dance we do every two weeks. He constantly talks about the little people talking to him and they constantly help him recognize the gifts of every one he encounters, he is extremely happy person. He laughs all the time. He is a wonderful human being. Okay, before I began to get into this some of the real specifics that I wanna talk about, I wanna start talk about language limitations. He talks about them a lot too, that’s what I’ll be joining from and now he… he well, he is not… he didn’t go to college. He doesn’t have a college education. So this might be really shocking that somebody could talk this brilliantly. He has never read a book. He says he has never read a book. Ahmm… but it’s unbelievably brilliant and far more sophisticated than anything I could ever think of, the things that he says. Ahmm… I remember the first time I read that it’s time back "Grapes of Ralph" and when I read that book I thought man these people aren’t educated and they are so smart. I couldn’t believe it, they were so smart. They were like my dad. My dad doesn’t read. He never learned how to read and my mom went to the tenth grade and they are both smart. I mean, they can tell things, they sing so funny with so many different meanings, it’s unbelievable. And they can fix things. I can’t find the spark plug in my car. They can do things like that and they can talk about things from a perspective that’s really interesting. Well, Whitebear doesn’t have a college education, but what did you hear the things he has to say? So, lemme start of talking about that. Umm… in a earlier workshop with Gel(ph), she was talking about lot of the legal documents that were signed and land probably how our notion of Indians being forced their property and signing off and all these different things. As she was talking, I was thinking Indian people were pushed in a position of the written word. Very early with contact with Euro-Americans and this idea that the written language was held incredible prominence. What something that was very difficult for people to understand; the Indian people to understand and so this in… Euro-American were very interested in how important the oral tradition was with American-Indian people. Well, I think that there is a lot of validity in talking about that. If you ever work with American-Indians and I think it’s important that you know that the oral tradition has been extremely important to them and if you talk with people who have a background of an oral history, which I have because my father couldn’t read, my mom didn’t read much but she read some, then… ummm… then that changes the way you would interact with people. People who come from that background and so I think that’s really, that's really important. You see for Indian people, the emphasizing the oral tradition is associated with being closer and proximity with people. The written words separates us from others to a certain extent. Unless you read (inaudible ) I rips that idea apart and talks about how important the written words. Are you read the studies by Penny Baker(ph) an neurotic psychologist, who talked about the importance (inaudible ) boy it’s really good. I really agreed with what I read there, but on a certain level I think we all understand how important that oral tradition is and connecting us with others. Psychology has also held oral talking as primary as well. I mean talk therapy. We have this hunch of psychologist if we can get people to talk about their feelings and their ideas with another person it connects us with them in such a way that it might bring about healing for that other… that person we are talking about, may be even little bit for ourselves and so it’s really important and I think that’s good. But Whitebear goes deeper than that. I mean we’ve all heard that Indian, the oral tradition. Why Indian? That’s about here. You don’t hear anything else and that’s suppose to be really cool to know that. Well, Whitebear goes way beyond that. He…he… when I started talking to him about that he said, he looked at me he said, "Ah… we need to get to hearing each other without talking." He says, "you see even for hymns, speech and words don’t carry full presence. It’s presence that carries healing." He goes on and he says "a person can start in his attempts to become mermatized," that's his, he use to say word like terms to become mermatized by not putting words to their experiences that are overly dramatic. When you are in the pause, when you are in the pause, there is silence. All information is there. It’s like leaving your body. You are no longer your own vessel. It’s like being inside of a light bulb and it suddenly gets turned on, I see everything around me and not a single bit of judgment. It’s silent of no ways. No words can express the healing that occurs in the moment. It’s the place for your mission. I suppose no words can express that knowing. We can get caught up in words and words can began to determine meanings that separate us from the experience. He connects words with judgments. It offers an allusion of summing things up into tiny compartments. Yeah! Whitebear challenges the whole field of psychology with the idea that talking is gonna bring about a cure. He doesn’t say… he… he… he later he talks and I’ve mentioned this and say, he later he says "talking, there is a place for talking," but he… if… what he challenges us with us today is to ask that question. He asked the question about talking. It’s kind of hard to bring silence into a session. May be on as assignment of a session, but (inaudible ) the pause with the light bulb comes on and you are inside of that and you are a part of everything that exists, is where you get healed. So, I think this is important. Here is another example of that idea. I said something about visions. I’m having visions and he said in the one of the, in the interviews he said "visions ahh… visions is just a word. It’s a word. The spirits are telling me right now that we keep going over to find concepts. What matters is what you are experiencing right now where it can be captured and whether it can be captured in a concept or not. I‘m to sit down in the categories no longer matter. They say I’ll be able to help others without speaking or doing anything some day. Most people just attach themselves to ideas and concepts with meanings and definitions. I work not to force words on to the pictures I see. So he repeatedly warns me not to mistake concepts for experiences. Words and concepts split life into separate segments. Further the use of words may even preclude or even exacerbate rather than heal. Words require separation of the speaker from the experience. He goes on and he says "energy is what supposed to be communicated, words are just vibrations, everything is communication with vibrations. Rocks communicate with us, hawks communication with us, little people communicate with us." So he is really emphasizing this. You know, you talk to lot of older Indian people and they will tell you that they often spoke with animals and other things in nature that they communicated with them. Whitebear describes unmediated experiences which he understands. Communication vibrations from multitudinous aspects of reality. He said "it’s better to not talk about these experiences if you are gonna try to control them. We can’t be fix at it on the (inaudible ) of these experiences. Be grateful the experiences is happening right now not trying to, but little talking about them, but you gotta let him go." So, Whitebear challenges us. The very underpinnings of what, what we do. He suggest that are using verbal language may be at the core of what our problems are, our psychological problems are. He is not the first one to say it. You remember the second Act of Hamlet, Words… Words… Words… if you read the King Lear the whole thing is about the problem with words. This is… this is written by the greatest English word smith that ever lived. He thought as problematic, words… words… words we keep thinking, we can interpret our experiences with words. Then even in psychology we’ve had some (inaudible ) talks about that. You know, he… he introduce psychology to the flowering(ph) signify which suggested psychological distortions are at the very source of how we miss interpret our experiences with words and he says we are displaced from experience and words only contaminate what they describe with falseness resulting in alienation and then of course if you read (inaudible ) he does that whole thing on schizophrenic and talks about it in terms of words. So, Whitebear tries to get to us to rethink some things about psychology and about therapy and they are worth at least considering its… for us to realize the basis of what we trying to do is to bring about a connection or relationship with somebody and words have helped a lot of people, but may be if we reconsider some of our basic assumptions about talk therapy, talk therapy we can expand it to something beyond what it is and you know, it also explains the crazy ideas about the (inaudible ) ideas about Indian traditions too and it offers us some ways of roots about how the oral traditions is related to… to direct experience, more direct experience. But there is even a greater experience and that’s in silence in the pause, he says, according to him. So, just a couple of other things he said, but and then I’ll move on to the other points but one of the things I told him, he said… he said when he prays sometimes he doesn’t say the same words he used the day before. I mean the same language, the same words of the language and I said "why is that?" he says "because every second of everyday changes and so it’s impossible to use the same word to describe what happened three minutes ago." He said "when you mermatized you go with the flow of that energy in other words." So, anyway maybe it’s something we can begin to at least rethink and there might be a possibility of expanding our ways of looking at those things. Okay. I’m gonna go to the second point. A pause language, I’m gonna call it four times fourfold vision of diagnosis, four times fourfold vision of diagnosis. I got that tale, you know, but you read William Blake in here? William Blake is one of my favorite poets. I remember watching… my very favorite Johnny Depp movie, you know Johnny Depp is quite Indian. my very favorite work of the movie of Johnny Depp is called Dead Man. God! It’s a great movie. Is anybody seen Dead Man in here? You gotta go out rent out it's a masterpiece. Isn’t it amazing? Well, anyway in that movie, Johnny Depp his name is Bill Blake and he… he shows out in the west in the 19th century and there is all the Indian guy there like 1880 or something and he was taken into a boarding school and then shipped off to England and when he was in England, he read this guy named William Blake, the whole movie is based on William Blake lines and some of his paintings and stuff and if you know Blake every single scene, Oh God! They got that from that poem, they got that one from the… you read it and well, anyway William, when he sees… since he sees Bill Blake the guns slinger he says, William Blake you came back and so he started doing(ph) like an England. I did the same thing, I went to school in England and that’s where I was introduced William Blake and I thought this guy understands us better than rest of these people. And so I stole that title William Blake phrase uses the phrase Fourfold vision and that’s what I have titled this section four times fourfold vision. So, before discussing his views on healing I asked… I asked him about his visionary perspective and he said, well, he said "this little people have shown me a hundred and twenty eight dimensions what it means to be a human being." What… the aspects of that of human being. Interesting enough I was with the Buddhist priest last summer for two weeks from Tibet. They have a hundred and twenty eight dimensions of feelings. Fascinating, that he would have the exact same number you know, he could care less about Buddhism. It’s not a part of any thing he is interested, but he had the same number. And he said if all the… he said now really and truly he said there is only everything is one. When the spirits just break it up into these different dimensions so that we can understand it, the meaning of it. So that we can gradually move toward not needing meaning any more. But, so they are not really separate. Uhmm… but here is something he said he said about that, this is a complex I guess. He says "the dimensions are really not separate and none of them are any higher than another, they are all in each other. Somebody may think a person is emotionally sick. But you have to consider their mental ailment and so on. Spirits thought me that there are four aspects to the physical dimension; the physical-physical, the physical-mental, the physical-emotion, the physical-spiritual and so on and the spirits taught me to think in terms of each dimension in terms of its four aspects. But there are really a unity. Spirits just divided down to help humans in their need to understand. When you are mermatized, you are sensitized to three hundred and sixty degrees reality. I’m able to see how the emotional (inaudible ) is held in the mental or the physical is held in the emotional. And he sees that. He actually is able to see it. Again, he reminds us of the unitary nature of reality. But what he offers us is something incredible, to me it’s incredible because he utilizes a panoramic awareness of the whole person when he diagnosis problems these working with somebody on. For one he says you have to be present in the moment in order to see these interacting dimensions and you have to be malbo(ph), isn’t that like call. I think that is just so incredible mobility that word should be introduced into all our text about how did you do a diagnosis? Now, don’t give me you're wrong, I’ve read the bio-cycle social models and I know that we’ve improved in terms of moving beyond the medical model to more holistic ways of looking. But this one the way what he is talking about is really amazing. It amazes me that he… the word mobility to move around like this to see these dimensions in the way they interact and it doesn’t stop there. He says it has to be in the moment. In other words, you can't be judging the person when you do it. One of the things we do so often is judge even our clients when we began to label them all sorts of disease, all sorts of problems and everything. But he also had to be in the moment and we have to be able to just not ask, keep one to say see their guess. He doesn’t say that this is wonder about their guess. You know why the is wonder about the guess? because if you figure out what somebody is give(ph) in you stop, you giving on your time. You know time, the guess of the person that have to be wondered about or else should… you… you… you think you figured them out. The wondering is really the important part of that. So, one of the most profound things he offers us this integrated psycho-spiritual perspective. For him they are not perspectives, but perceptions. That is really important. We walk around and talk about our perspective on this and our perspective on that, he doesn’t talk about perspectives. He talks about perceptions, direct perceptions. Now you think, my thinking is full of shit, but he might not be. Certainly, the things he is saying out of what he claims to be as direct perceptions are pretty amazing to me. But he says that’s what eventually has to happen and as I said yet to be in the moment to do it, you can't judge and you have to be able to wonder about another person's gift. Now he says as long as you stay in resentment or as long as you keep worrying what somebody said to you yesterday that offended you or worrying about the future, it’s impossible to entering into the no time, no space were healing occurs. And you know, some of this, as I study that estimated from 50 to 90% of all conversations that time and conversations consist in talking negatively about somebody. He says you’ll never see the invisible world as long as you are there. Enter the present, be where you are at, wonder about the gifts that have occurred in your life, wonder about the gifts in the most traumatic experiences of your life, wonder about the gifts of the persons that rubs you the wrong way. This is a very profound spiritual perspective, I think. It’s a part that’s fairly been suppressed as spiritual dimension has been suppressed in our field. But he offers us this mobility this fluidity. He moves in and out of time and space, into no time and no space, he enters into deficits and strings and one dimension after another and their associations and their combinations. He sees the person individually and existing it every level of social and multidimensional in fractal, in unitary reality. He looks at all of those in order to have his diagnosis. Okay. I’m going to really briefly talk about blocking here, because I only have like twelve more minutes. Because I really wanna get to couple of the other things. I can't talk about this in too much depth, because I want you to get down that(ph). Umm… he says this idea of a… of a no time, no space. This place of pure energy that he spends much of his time in. He is drumming right now for me. If you(ph) tell me where, when I was here, there is about six of these people are drumming and doing this incredibly old chant right now. I can, I know they are doing that now. He is there entering into no time, no space and what he says, he says in one… he says… he said two things about what no time, no space was. He said… he said the energy that is moving in this world is like a huge ocean, but everybody takes a bucket and they try to catch the energy with their bucket and they try to keep it. Keep that energy and it just wares out. He said when we should be channels that allow the energy to flow through us all the time. They realized words he spoken in the tenth end of your, I said "can you tell me about pure energy again one more time. This is what he said to me. He said "you ever saw a (inaudible ) walking across the dead… that read dare(ph) you, you come through when you drive up to where our lodge is? Ever seen that (inaudible ) that goes there?" I said "no." He said "do you ever seen (inaudible ) moving across a pastures. I said "yeah lots of times." Have you ever seen one in New York? Do they have (inaudible ) in New York? No, not in the city. He said "ever you seen?" I said "yeah." He said "well it is like when they are moving away," he said "pure energy looks just like a (inaudible ) that is, that is waddling away from you and I said "oh! Okay." And he said "you couldn’t see it if you are thinking about how they stink" and then he added this is the last words of all the interviews I had with him, "you don’t have to have Alzheimer's to experience pure energy and that was it he got up and left. And so maybe you guys can help me interpret that one. But that is his last word. But we… he says the source of illness that we have… ahh… we experiences from blocking energy. We either try to contain energy with our concepts and think we figured things out, we get locked into our theoretical perspective or concept about this or that or get locked into certain feelings and we think that and we become feeling dominated and we block energy that way or we block energy by judging other people which is the one of the most common when he talks about. Umm… now, let's, I want to talk about spirit move into spirit. That’s what sicknesses to him, illnesses to him. I’m gonna talk about spiritual healing now (inaudible ). He says that umm… spiritual heal when we began to move in the room of spiritual healing he says, we are dealing with often some pretty complex things. He said, one time he said, he works on a farm, he digs ditches. He said "I was going from the farm driving away in my pickup" and he said "I thought tomorrow I would like to ask that farmer if I could do this on his farm?, I think it would be really cool" and he said "oh God! He wouldn’t like that idea." And what he did because he is mindful. He thought where did that come from? Why did I start worrying about what he was going to think about my idea and this spirit little people said "what happened to you when you are a little?" And he had this pictures… these pictures come up in his head and it was pictures he said of his dad saying "go get me a watermelon for the family" and he said "I went and got this watermelon." He said "I picked up the biggest watermelon there was." These stories will sound crazy to New York city people. But, we go buy things big, where he said about this big watermelon and he said "they open the door and I walked in and I stumbled." Just a little bit away, he said he fell and it splattered all over the kitchen floor. I mean I stood there and he said my dad was so sweet. He said "that’s okay, I should have sent your bigger brother to go get that watermelon" and he said he was crashed. He was absolutely crashed. Now what he says happens, he says what happens, is we began to live our lives through those experiences. They keeps us from experiencing the fresh energy and so instead of experiencing the farmer that he was gonna talk too in the direct way, this past experiences blocked the energy from him experiencing this farmer in a, with the right perception. But as the little people helped him to work through that and so… now, this is what gets really interesting. He said when he does healing with people. He says "I bring them back to some of the original problems that they are… these are original advanced analyze that affected them." He says "I bring them back to that and I help them re-experience that. Now, that’s what… that’s what we get in psychoanalytic therapy isn’t it? You bring them back to the original trauma. You pick off the external clusters traumas off the original one. You get back to the original trauma and you help this catharsis and insight. Okay, he does that, but he goes further than that. He says "but it’s not enough." He said "you gotta get him into the pure energy that existed before the trauma" and I said "like what?" He said "have you ever little kids?" He said "when they are playing and they just play from one game to the next then they go into this style, then they go into that," he said "very free pure energy" and so as I… he said "that's sort of what I’m talking about." I said "so you have to bring him back to that place." He said "and hold them in pure energy." Then when I got ready to come here I was asking about that again on the phone and he said "that’s not enough either, you gotta bring him back to nothingness before that energy even." And so, that is when I will be exploring more with him in future interviews. But how fascinating, similar in some ways to modern psychology. Bringing back those things, but he then pushes that a couple of steps further back into that pure energy, he is talking about. He also um… elaborates in details, notions about Indians. Every book you ever see, white people live in the future, Indians live in the present and what the hell is that mean? Well, Whitebear gives us a spiritual discussion about it. That in our spirituality being mermatized, being in the eternal now, is really significant and really important. Very last point I’ve got it though this in here, because too much of the stuff I’ve talked about sounds too civilized. So just the last few minutes I wanted to talk about, last five minutes I wanted to talk about little people. I grew up hearing about little people all my life about the spirits, like the (inaudible ) how little people or little children into the woods and offer them three choices a poison herb, a knife or some medicine herbs. And if a child picks the medicine herbs, those people will spend the rest of the hours interacting with the little people conducting healing in the world. Well, he spends every seconds of every day, every waking moment, may be even sleeping moments interacting with the little people spirits. He says "you might think I’m a disassociate", this is the word he used. "You might think I’m a disassociate." He said "but I’m in my energy and I feel good about being in my energy. So, it didn’t that matter" and I said "you really believe in little people?" He says "I don’t believe in them and I don’t disbelieve them. I’m just in that energy." That’s what his response to me when I said that. Now, this is couple things that happened with the little people, they are really fascinating. He says… he says "each one of us have three spirits. They move with us. One on the right, one on the left and one in the back and other spirits still, but there is always those three forming a diamond triangle which is the most important thought, idea that I won't even talk about today, that he deals with the diamonds. But, he says for me, he said "if you are in front of your client then you certainly cross from him." He said "when you are talking with them those spirits are with them and they are with you" and he says "what there (inaudible ) is for you all to get in your gifts. And if you get in your gift when you began to talk to them you will enter into the eternal now, you are entering in." He doesn’t use the word I used mermatized. He says "you all entering into the moment. You all enter into presence." He says "if you can enter that in any conversation on any day with any one, the spirits are able to come into time and space and do healing." And he said "and you switch places, when you go into the eternal or the into no time, no space they coming into time and space and they switch. Next time you will might be thinking, that what application is that ahead of psychology? I think a lot. If you wanna interpret that metaphorically, you find isn’t it beautiful? So beautiful thing to say. To enter into that state of presence with another human being and you do that through whatever I’ve been saying, wondering about the other persons gifts, staying in the moment without judging another person in terms of concepts. Staying in that moment was the way that will keep you from blocking the energy that keeps spirits from working. Now, periodically, he get real loud when you talk to me and I said "why are you talking so loud." Because so many spirits are talking to me. They are trying to tell me since there for right now and then he had get quieter and then he had say… say something to me and he’d say "a few minutes ago the spirits took me to Africa where we were talking." I said "oh really! Tell me about that." He said "there was a little baby dying there and the spirits either wanted to show me something or to use me for helping it move to the other side." And I said "okay." Well, there is the belief about Whitebear that we are far more than the isolated identity we think we are. He claims to experience himself as a fractal entity. In not as the schizophrenic, but as a person who can be in more places than one at a time, sort of like people who would have high fevers or people we call schizophrenics or what we do in dreams, are you the person in your dream? I want you (inaudible ) more than one I was that moved, because I did something imaginary… I can imagine ever doing in real life wasn’t I(ph). He was great, but could we began two different places like that? He has entered into as he claims to, you know into a perceptual awareness that allows him to do that. He says all of us do and he believes that it is very crucial that we realize that spiritual dimension over us as you know, he says he also use… now… this is another thing I think I propel to psychology. He says "sometimes he is working with somebody and he can't do it very well." He says "because I end up judging." One of the judgments he says "I have most as I was" he was sexually abused as a child and there might be something really hateful and you know, is that's the word he use and he said "I couldn’t work with him, then I will think. I met this women in the grocery store and the little people tell me that person has unconditional love. She don’t judge anybody" and so he and his spirit, he will go get that person who has unconditional love and bring that person to be with him to do the healing with these people that he is working with. Couldn’t that be kind of cruel? You are working with somebody and you are going into this blocks and you know somebody that would be able to work with them and you think of the person in terms of a model or you can think of that person in terms of their guess and how you might, you lie something they tortured, but you are not frozen in your dicarding(ph) and isolation, but instead you can tap into each other. Could I, see in some way connected with Gel(ph) this very second and somehow draw from her energy to help heal somebody else. I want that to sound as esoteric and freakish and weird as possible. Because I don’t want Whitebear to ever be civilized by white, black, green society. Because I think that’s the only way we can really grow. You can interpret as metaphors or his truth. But we need… we need people challenging some of our assumptions about reality and about what psychology is, if we ever intend to continue to grow. If you look at our MMPI that Gel(ph) has done this wonderful studies where, we elevate the hell out of schizophrenia indicants too. We know, we elevate every single one of about ten points. Now, there is one, is depression it's none. We don’t… we are not depressed, any of the… they got the name may be, none of us are depressed. So we are really happy. But we elevate paranoid, we are paranoid as hell, because we think people are after us. They might still are outlanders something I guess and then we also elevate schizophrenia of the… you know, in part of the way I think most people look at schizophrenia if… if they are too stack in that concept, they are not gonna see certain spiritual aspects of spirituality. But the best way to determine I think, I think is to look at the community that the person is a part of and to see what they are attitude, is about these experiences they have. See if they are comfortable in that energy, that make a world of difference. But what sad is, we keep shaving off the esoteric from… from reality and there… our world keep shrinking up more and more… more and more ending, don’t even believe in these things any more. Hence because the knowledge producers psychologists, sociologists, social scientist keep in inventing instruments to tell us what’s normal and what’s right and so we internalize them and even we don’t experience these extraordinary things anymore and what a better world we have to cross of it. Don’t we? Not to me. Give me Whitebear any day, you know. He offers something incredible. He keeps expanding the way I look at things. He believes entirely anonymity. Very few things can I say about him and he cut out even real basic things then there I thought, but that’s alright. It may mean on my paper will never get published, but I won't ever you know reveal that stuff about him. There is a lot of other stuff that I didn’t get to you, but I hope I'll write up two papers out of this eventually. Because he taught some of the diamonds was the most extraordinary thing, but yeah um… I think I revealed about all I can, can about him. My gosh! I mean look at this. Some people are at least open to hearing about it. I don’t know which Whitebear was here, maybe he can tell us about the future. He don’t do that much, but I see some people more open to it, but then we always have the… we always dealing with people who contract… who want to contract reality. Umm… Whitebear tries to expand the reality. We have tons of psychologists that are always trying to get just a direct correlation between this and that and they contract it and the only thing they can be real is that which can be a certain to the… old scientific method and I am I still(ph) deal with a lot that way. Okay, well, thank you very much.
