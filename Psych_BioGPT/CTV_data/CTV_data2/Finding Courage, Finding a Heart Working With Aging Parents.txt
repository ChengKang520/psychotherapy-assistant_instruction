00:00:40
SCOTT MILLER So the brief scale that I used in the beginning is called the outcome rating scale and like its name implies, it is accessing how you feel like things are going right now. And here is how you do this on computer, you simply move the cursor to some position along each of these lines with low scores to left, high scores to the right, and when you're done, you just give the -- the pad a touch and you'll go to the next item. Does that make sense? 

00:01:10
JENNIFER Yes. 

00:01:10
SCOTT MILLER  When you're looking back over the last week including today, how things have been going? 

00:01:20
[sil.] 

00:01:25
JENNIFER Let's see. 

00:01:25
SCOTT MILLER  Lets go back up here, about right there. 

00:01:30
JENNIFER A little down. 

00:01:30
SCOTT MILLER A little down. Say what? 

00:01:35
JENNIFER  Yes. 

00:01:40
SCOTT MILLER We just hit down here now. And the computer is taking a look at your score and then it's plotting that score compared to everybody else who scored similarly. And so your score actually is about a 26.8. And if you look here you can see this sort of modeled blue line right here that's called the clinical cut-off and this is the dividing line people who are in treatment, which would be scoring below the line and people who are not in treatment just scoring above the line. People who are saying more that -- above the line are saying more or like things are okay, but the closer you get to the line, the more you're saying, things are troubling me. 

00:02:25
JENNIFER Not okay. 

00:02:25
SCOTT MILLER  Not okay for you, does that make sense. 

00:02:30
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:02:30
SCOTT MILLER And then this blue line here, plots the expected amount of change over time -- 

00:02:35
JENNIFER But it looks like there is no change. 

00:02:35
SCOTT MILLER It does look like that for the first six week actually. Although there is some variability possible in between these red and these green lines. And so it's basically saying -- 

00:02:50
JENNIFER As I'm told. 

00:02:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:02:50
JENNIFER Its very discouraging. 

00:02:55
SCOTT MILLER It is discouraging. 

00:02:55
JENNIFER I mean, if I -- if things are not going to get better for six weeks. 

00:03:00
SCOTT MILLER Because you're thinking that -- 

00:03:00
JENNIFER Why bother. 

00:03:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah and the score doesn't really seem to fit how you're feeling. 

00:03:05
JENNIFER No. 

00:03:05
SCOTT MILLER It doesn't. You will be say -- you'll be saying that your feelings are much worse. 

00:03:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:03:10
SCOTT MILLER Than the score depicts. 

00:03:10
JENNIFER Yeah. I mean, I think, my God then people who are in therapy are feeling a lot worse than I am. 

00:03:15
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. All right, and in many respects that would be true that in some ways many of the people who are coming in are feeling worse. The likely amount of change that can be expected is somewhere up in here. And generally what that means is that, the changes are going to take more work over a longer period of time before you really start to feel better. 

00:03:40
JENNIFER  Where am I going to get the strength from? 

00:03:45
SCOTT MILLER  That's an issue. Does that sound right or wrong as I described the interpretation because it's all -- 

00:03:50
JENNIFER  It sounds discouraging. 

00:03:55
SCOTT MILLER It sounds discouraging. 

00:03:55
JENNIFER Do I just cry now. 

00:03:55
SCOTT MILLER  Okay. All right, look, don't mean for it to make you feel tearful but why don't we -- why don't we just talk about what it is that's going on and what you were hoping from today? 

00:04:10
JENNIFER  Well, it started when my dad died in May 26th. 

00:04:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Do you mind if I take some notes. 

00:04:20
JENNIFER Please. 

00:04:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:04:20
JENNIFER And my mom become my burden on May 26th and she has become a bigger and bigger burden and -- but other things happened also. When my father died on May 26th on the -- three days after this funeral, I broke my right arm, my humerus and I think of me -- it's hard to say it was related because it wasn't related to his funeral but I think in the upset of the funeral and everything, I think I just got clumsy and I tripped on my laptop computer cord and went over and hit a filing cabinet with my full weight of my body and ended up with my arm hanging for three months. 

00:05:10
SCOTT MILLER On my. 

00:05:10
JENNIFER They won't cast it, they won't do surgery, they just had me hang it, I had to sleep sitting up and they had it just hang. I'm in still physical therapy for it even now. 

00:05:20
SCOTT MILLER This was a huge disruption. 

00:05:25
JENNIFER Well, everything went to hell. 

00:05:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:05:25
JENNIFER I stopped working, I couldn't do anything I have you know was -- I was totally dependent. 

00:05:30
SCOTT MILLER And -- and -- 

00:05:30
JENNIFER And my mother was alone out in where she lives, two hours from here. I talk to everyday but I couldn't -- I couldn't go out there and I couldn't be with her because -- because I couldn't drive. Then, as I started to get better. 

00:05:55
SCOTT MILLER You mean? 

00:05:55
JENNIFER As I began to be able to drive and -- 

00:05:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:05:55
JENNIFER  I mean, last couple of months now. 

00:06:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:06:00
JENNIFER I started to like go out there and see her and try to be of some assistance to her and I realized that she was like crazy, like she has always been whacky but I mean whacky like I'm saying whacky, you know, I mean like, I don't know if you think your parents are whacky but my mum has always been whacky. But she was getting really whacky, I mean like really way off. And I realized I know that my father was masking a lot of her inabilities that he was doing everything for her and like she didn't know that they had air conditioning and it was very, very hot this summer and I send someone over to help her with something and they were sitting and sweat was rolling off the end of their nose and he said its impossible here and I said there is air conditioning and she didn't know. She didn't know there was air conditioning. So Dave drove out with me and we found the air conditioning unit but we didn't know how to put it on. Part of the whole system of the house, I mean, she just didn't know. 

00:07:00
SCOTT MILLER She was unaware of all of that. 

00:07:05
JENNIFER She was never aware of it, I mean, she said Louis, its cold or its hot or whatever and he would snap too. So -- 

00:07:10
SCOTT MILLER He really took care of all those kinds of things. 

00:07:15
JENNIFER Yeah, he took care of her entirely and he had the grace to up and die on May 26th in a couple of minute, I mean, he was going to bed, he keeled over and he died. And in fact, even how I found out about it, I found out about it the next morning, the phone rang like at 5:30 in the morning, it was my daughter calling from Boston and she was crying and I thought my God what happened. She says grandpa died and I said, what I mean, grandpa died out here and you are telling me from -- I mean it was like surreal. My mother didn't want to bother me by telling me my father died. So she called my daughter in Boston and told her. Anyway -- 

00:08:05
SCOTT MILLER  So here you find this out from your daughter, what's her first name? 

00:08:10
JENNIFER Monica. 

00:08:10
SCOTT MILLER Monica. 

00:08:10
JENNIFER  Yeah. 

00:08:15
SCOTT MILLER She calls you to tell you that your dad died and the reason is -- and she told you that her -- mom had said that -- 

00:08:20
JENNIFER I mean, it was unreal, I mean it was 5:30 in the morning and I'm waking up, I'm saying this is, this is not real, I mean something is really unreal about this. So I called my mother and she said oh Monica told you. Did she ever tend to tell me. Anyway -- 

00:08:35
SCOTT MILLER You were upset with her? 

00:08:40
JENNIFER I -- well, you know my father was in dialysis for four and a half years. 

00:08:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:08:45
JENNIFER So his death wasn't unexpected, I mean, we just didn't know he was going to drop dead, I mean -- 

00:08:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:08:50
JENNIFER In my mind, he would get ill, he would get more ill, he would kind of you know die that way, but he just, his heart went. And it was all in a moment, in two minutes, we was dead. And my mother on the other hand, has been -- well, let me -- let me jump to the event, she has been living alone, she has been unreasonable -- but so has been whacky and always been unreasonable in particularly with me. And my brother got killed in an airplane crash in 1982, so I am the only person in the family that she can lean on. 

00:09:25
SCOTT MILLER  This was like your only sibling? 

00:09:30
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:09:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:09:30
JENNIFER So I'm -- I'm the only person responsible for her right know. 

00:09:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:09:35
JENNIFER And about six, seven weeks ago, she fell and she had an accident in the house, she tripped and she fell and she couldn't get up. And I had talked to her on Wednesday evening at about eight o'clock, I mean, I check on her many times a day, everyday, because she was an accident waiting to happen. 

00:09:55
SCOTT MILLER You call her, you mean. 

00:10:00
JENNIFER Call her, call her, call her. So on Thursday, I call her and she -- her habits were, she would get up late, she was sleeping on her La-Z-Boy, she won't sleep in a bed, she will sleep in her La-Z-Boy with the TV all the time and so she would sleep or not sleep most of the night, I mean, she would get up, she would do whatever, she would get up maybe mid morning or towards noon and then she would get dressed and she would go out and she lives in gated community of Leisure World. So she would catch a bus and go and get lunch or breakfast or dinner or whatever she was getting out and she would talk to people on the bus or talk to people in the restaurant and she'd come home and I talk to her. And I tried to call her and she wasn't answering on Thursday and I figured well she is out, by 5:30 she wasn't home and I began to get concerned. So I started calling every 15 minutes. Well, by 9:30 I was pretty sure she was not alive, my worst fantasy is that she is lying on the floor, she can't get up and she hears the phone ringing and she can't answer. So by 9:30, I called the kind of the House Police at Leisure World and they go over and they -- 

00:11:05
SCOTT MILLER  Check on her. 

00:11:10
JENNIFER Check on her. Then they found her lying down on the floor, rolling at her own thesis, and she has been there about 24 hours. And they called 911 and they took her to Saddleback Memorial hospital. So -- anyway I knew -- now I know where she is, I mean, she is now in the emergency room. So I call over there and they tell me that they are hydrating her and that she is dehydrated and they are cleaning her up and I go down to the next day to see her and she says, I don't know why all the fuzz is about, I fell. I said mom, you know, you have died, I mean, it's really serious. I want to go home, I want to go home, I want to go home. So she starts saying I want to go home and she starts getting aggressive with me, I mean she has always been aggressive with me and my father. My father would listen to her, I fortunately kind of married and left at 18. And that's basically the story. I mean, he stayed, in fact, I would say to him, you can see he would take sides with her against me and he would say, you are going to get married someday, you're going to leave and I'll stuck with her, I'm sticking with her, I'm staying on her side. So when he died, she had nobody left to argue with, to fight with, to be on her side, to listen to her and she went to the hospital and then on Monday, after -- she feel on Thursday, by Monday they had to place her somewhere and they put her in a place for rehab for getting her to walk better. 

00:12:45
SCOTT MILLER  So they also deemed that -- the physicians involved deemed that she was not capable of going straight home. 

00:12:55
JENNIFER No, she couldn't be alone. I mean, she would fall in and she was really in danger. 

00:13:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:13:00
JENNIFER And -- so they put her in a place called Country Villa which was nearby or perhaps was across from the hospital and my mother got a very, very complex story about how they missed taking her to her house and dropped her off at the Country Villa but it was mistake. And she kept screaming, it's a mistake, I'm here by mistake and it got to look more and more like she was delusional. So they started treating her like she was delusional, they got a psychiatrist and he said she had dementia and the critical thing was that she asked a CNE, a nursing assistant for a cup of coffee and they brought her a cup of coffee and she threw it at the nursing assistant. And they called me and they said, you take her out of here, she is not appropriate for here. So I said to her, mom I understand that you threw a cup of coffee at a nurse. And she said, she can't get a hot cup of coffee here, like that would appropriate unlike. And then she was taking her -- 

00:14:00
SCOTT MILLER  This was out of character for her, I mean, she wouldn't have done that kind of thing, she was whacky growing up and a little bit crazy but not this kind of thing. 

00:14:10
JENNIFER  No. Not throwing something at a human being. And she was taking a walk with that she had and she was pushing against the window and making noise and they were afraid for her and afraid for their staff. So they insisted that she leave there and they placed her in a hospital, Coastal Community Hospital and we went down to see her and she was so whacked out on drugs, she was just you know like -- I walked in -- we walked in and I didn't -- we came through a long hospital corridor, down to this wing which was the -- the place they put daffy people I guess and we get in and we kind of like come out the dock into the light and there is a day room and my mother starts screaming at me from across the room. What the hell are you doing here, what the hell are you doing here, are you crazy and I'm insulted right, and she says -- so we take her out of there and we get her into a private room and she tells me that this a -- it's a Christian organization and they are raising money and funds for her, she actually had some stuff from the Salvation Army there, volunteers had come by. So it was whacky but it had some basis, I mean but it was whacky. And she'd be kidnapped and put there. 

00:15:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. She used those words, she had been kidnapped and placed here by these Christian people raising funds for her. 

00:15:35
JENNIFER  Something like that, I mean, you're close enough. 

00:15:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Alright. 

00:15:40
JENNIFER So they had two weeks with her there, they medicated her up the yin-yang, I mean, she was whacky from medication there and then I had to have her moved to a skilled nursing facility and I tried to get into something nearby her because that's two hours away, I mean, it's a long journey. And I couldn't get a bed locally and a friend of mine whose husband is a doctor, talked about a place in the valley, this Chandler Convalescent Hospital, which now she says she didn't mention in that but I don't -- how would I get the name Chandler Convalescent Hospital, she mentioned it but she said well she never recommended it but my mom is there because they had a bed and her husband on the staff. 

00:16:30
SCOTT MILLER How far is that from here? 

00:16:30
JENNIFER About half an hour to forty minutes. 

00:16:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay, alright. So it's a little better. 

00:16:35
JENNIFER Yeah, it's a little better but my mother is very unhappy there. And they called me three times yesterday to -- they took -- he took her off all medication, I mean, he just -- he said that she -- she was sleeping because she was medicated, well she was. And he took her off everything and just to see what would happen and she is agitated and they agreed that they would call me before they gave any Ativan. Well, yesterday they called me in the morning and then they called me in the evening and then they called me at 12:35 last night. 

00:17:10
SCOTT MILLER At night. 

00:17:10
JENNIFER  Telling me that she is screaming and she is keeping everybody up. The evening before I've been there and -- 

00:17:20
SCOTT MILLER And they are calling you for a permission or let you know they are gonna give her a drug. 

00:17:25
JENNIFER For permission. Well, anyway for the -- to let me know they're gonna give her a drug but it seems like it's for the permission and I just wanted to say anything, give her anything. The evening before I've been there at about six o'clock right after she ate and she was lying there, her eyes were closed and I said mom, she opened her eyes and she started sobbing, oh I'm so glad to see you, I'm so glad to see you, oh you've got to get me out of her, this is a terrible place, they hate me here, they hate me. I'm thinking its interactional I mean, everything relational, you know, you do some things to people that make them irritated. But she insisted on crying and sobbing and screaming and I asked the person she is sharing the room with, my mother is deaf, so she couldn't hear me. I asked her if she has been this way before I got there or was it just for me. And she said, no she has been this way since she got up after her nap. And she just was carrying on and carrying on and carrying on. So I've been to some places looking for a place to place her, it's not called skilled, they're called assisted living, assisted living. But the thing is that seven weeks ago, there is someone who is living alone, getting on and off buses, getting her meals, being social and now she is in a wheelchair, she is incontinent, she is irrational, I've applied for conservatorship and the conservator investigator called me and asked me if I have good terms with her, I said, as good as ever. And is it anybody who would oppose the conservatorship. No, nobody was going to oppose it. And he send me a letter saying that he had talked to her and told her that her daughter was applying for conservatorship, I said holy cow, he told her, you know he told her, how can he tell her. And she said, oh. And he said do you oppose that? She said no. Do you want to court? No. And I'm thinking how could this be, well she was so unreasonable, none of it made sense, she didn't know the President of United States, she didn't know the date, she didn't know where she was, she didn't know how long she was there, she didn't anything, I mean like why do you tell somebody who is totally unreasonable something when you ask them a reasonable question like do you oppose her being your conservator. 

00:19:50
SCOTT MILLER Right, so she wasn't oriented even at this latest place? 

00:19:55
JENNIFER No, no, this is just a week ago, less than a week ago. 

00:20:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:20:00
JENNIFER She is totally disoriented. So she was crying and sobbing and saying; she said to me something about being in New York. Where are we know. I said, we are in North Hollywood. She said, North Hollywood, how did we get to North Hollywood. And I said, well mom, you were living in Leisure World. I was, so when did we come here from New York. I said, well 50 years ago. She said that long. I said, well it was 1956 wasn't it. She says that long, really. And I said, yeah but I mean like it's -- it's startling to me to see my mother, she has got big blue eyes and she just looks up and then she looks so innocent and such like -- like a baby and I -- I can't I just -- I can't -- I can't superimpose that on the dragon lady you know my mother and I feel and she is crying and she is sobbing that I should take her home now and I can't I mean where I'm going to put her, I can't take here home and she is saying take me any place, just get me out of here, this is terrible, they are mean to me, they are mean to me, your father would -- if your father were here he would beat them up because they are so mean to me and I'm thinking oh god, just get me out of here, I mean, just let me get out of here but I can't really get out of there. I mean, I'm -- I take it with me. I feel -- I feel all kinds, I feel terrible, I feel like there are no good choices and I worry that that will happen to me 20 years down the line and I pray that I drop dead all at once like my dad did and then I don't become a burden and unreasonable and hysterical, I mean, it's just awful, just awful. So I've seen some places and -- 

00:21:55
SCOTT MILLER You're still working on this? 

00:21:55
JENNIFER Oh yeah, you know, I've got -- I've got -- well we saw three places in the last -- little more than a week. And you know the first place was 7,000 dollars a month which was lovely but 7,000 a month, she will run out of money in a few years. And the next place was 4,000 dollars a month, which was more reasonable but it was very dark and it was four stories high, and all the living would go on inside that building, I mean, they would no, nothing but that and the last place was closer to here and it was two stories high but it was more like a ranch style living, I mean, there was a patio in the back, there were walks and ways, I mean, she'd be able to manage in a wheelchair and it was light and bright and I'm working on that. But she has to qualify, she has to qualify and I went to the doctor's office and I said you know, I had some sheets about qualifying and the doctor said, he was now a doctor there, he said to qualify, you have the money, doesn't that qualify you, I said no, no, you can't be demented. You can mild cognitive impairment but you can't be demented. I mean like, hello what else that mean. And I'm afraid she's got dementia but the doctor said to me, no, no you don't know real dementia, I mean, this is, she is mild cognitive impairment but I'm worried that she does have dementia and if get her at the -- at the -- the assisted living place and they'll turn her away, I mean -- 

00:23:35
SCOTT MILLER Then where would you go. 

00:23:35
JENNIFER Then where would I go. She can't come here, I'd tell you that, I mean it could kill me. I can't -- I can't -- I can't and I feel so bad about her. There is another piece and that is that she will never get to be my mother, I mean, the mother I didn't have when I was growing up, the one that I wanted, I now will never have her. 

00:24:00
SCOTT MILLER  There was always a chance up till now? 

00:24:05
JENNIFER I never really thought about it but I guess there really was, you know. And know she is gone, I mean, she is gone, expect her body is strong, she could live for ten years like this and then her money will be gone and then -- then what we are -- are we going to pick it up, I mean it's -- ah I'll tell you, if you don't have a long-term care insurance, you should get long-term care insurance because -- because if you don't let it now, you can't qualify for it later. 

00:24:35
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:24:35
JENNIFER And it's -- it's quite a burden. 

00:24:40
SCOTT MILLER You know I -- I just went through a similar kind of thing with my father. 

00:24:45
JENNIFER Well, I remember he had the AAA surgery a few years ago. 

00:24:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. And my mother passed away in September. 

00:24:50
JENNIFER Really. 

00:24:50
SCOTT MILLER And he has been really lost. The two of them were really quite a pair. 

00:24:55
JENNIFER Yeah, yeah. 

00:24:55
SCOTT MILLER  And in January, he went to see a physician who said he had acute myeloid leukemia, this is three months after my mother's death. And so they started a chemotherapy regimen that within weeks, he can't get out of bed, he can't think, he can't take care of himself, he is unsteady on his feet and they're still doing the chemotherapy and I'm been told by the physicians who I'm talking to personally, I don't think it is, heroine is your situation, you had three people, I have two brothers rather. It's all up to you basically in this situation. They are telling me this is the course of the disease and this is how it's going to go, which means that within six months, both parents are gonna be gone. And he is not -- he is not cognitively there anymore. 

00:26:00
JENNIFER  So who is with him now. 

00:26:05
SCOTT MILLER He is home alone now. 

00:26:05
JENNIFER He is home alone? 

00:26:05
SCOTT MILLER  Yeah, well let me tell you what happened. Turns out he is -- his condition deteriorated, I pushed to having him examined by somebody else and this other physician says he doesn't have leukemia. 

00:26:20
JENNIFER  What? 

00:26:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. They stopped the chemotherapy and within weeks he is back. Now, he has a blood disorder that will eventually take his life but literally the treatment was killing him. I don't know what's happening in your situation but I think of all the things that have happened in your mother's life here in the last year really, the guy she depends on. 

00:26:55
JENNIFER Left six months. 

00:26:55
SCOTT MILLER  Yeah. 

00:27:00
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:27:00
SCOTT MILLER Gone. Then she is moved from place to place. 

00:27:00
JENNIFER Yeah. Well that's the last four -- if you count her at home, it's the fifth place in two months. 

00:27:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:10
JENNIFER I understand that that moving people at that age, I mean, I just think of her at that age -- 

00:27:15
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:27:15
JENNIFER I mean I've never had at that age before in my life and so is mother. 

00:27:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:27:15
JENNIFER She was a very lintel force but she was always in charge of herself and now she is not in charge of herself and you said five moves in two moths, less than two months. And you tell me -- 

00:27:30
SCOTT MILLER She is not only -- she is not only able to be the mother you hoped she would be, she is not even the mother that she usually was. 

00:27:35
JENNIFER Yeah, right. 

00:27:40
SCOTT MILLER When she was capable of strong determined and tell everybody and -- 

00:27:40
JENNIFER Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:40
SCOTT MILLER  How can you do what she says in a way now given that way she is? 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
SCOTT MILLER And yet at the same time, you are doing a lot. You're worrying about her constantly before this you were calling her all the time, you were really the reason why she -- they found her. 

00:28:05
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:28:05
SCOTT MILLER Think that you'd not called. 

00:28:05
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:28:05
SCOTT MILLER  And then, now you are finding a place for her to go. 

00:28:10
JENNIFER Yeah. Now I'm becoming a conservator. 

00:28:15
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. I'm thinking about the money and how long does this last and where do you go, who wants to make that kind of decision about their parent, you know, what home do you get to go in based on how much money you have and we're not talking about a piece of meat here. 

00:28:30
JENNIFER  But maybe we are, I mean, it's like mother is not my mother, I mean, this is a little person with blue eyes who is looking up at me innocently saying I'm so glad you came, I'm so happy to see you. You know, I'm looking at her and I'm thinking, it's like she is channel surfing and for a moment I'm on the channel and then she might be interested in this box of tissues, reaching for it and then she might want the coke, I mean, whatever is on her channel at the moment and I can walk out and I'm gone off her channel, I'm off her radar, which is what I find about leaving, is that I just have to leave and I know I'm off her radar and she doesn't remember I was there, you know, every time she sees me, she says you've lost weight. I think, no I haven't lost any more weight, and I think no she doesn't remember me, it's like, ah man -- 

00:29:25
SCOTT MILLER And she were a piece of meat, it's seems like this decision would be easy. 

00:29:30
JENNIFER Well you won't treat your dog or cat this way. 

00:29:35
SCOTT MILLER Alright. 

00:29:35
JENNIFER I mean, you know, we try to make arrangements for her to be as comfortable as she can somewhere where they don't throw her out. I mean you won't treat a cat or dog this way. 

00:29:50
SCOTT MILLER  Until where do you go? 

00:29:55
JENNIFER I don't know. 

00:29:55
SCOTT MILLER What do you do? 

00:29:55
JENNIFER  I don't know. I know I'm not the only person who have this problem. 

00:30:00
SCOTT MILLER No, you are a part of a huge generation but that doesn't make it any better. 

00:30:05
JENNIFER Yeah, I just never had it before and I didn't expect it, I mean, I didn't expect with my father dying, I mean, I had -- so I had no idea that I had some idea. I mean, I knew she was reasonable, I just didn't know she was so out of it. Now since I've going down to her house to clean up and to -- she put it on the market but she put it on the market for a hundred thousand dollars too much. And then she wouldn't give the realtor the keys, I mean like, she put it on the market but she didn't put it on the market. But the house was a mess and I've been going down with like a crew and getting it cleaned up and really putting it on the market, I mean like, giving the realtor the keys and doing that kind of stuff and in the meantime, neighbors have come by to tell me that my mother didn't know how to wash a dish wash, your mother didn't know how to work the washing machines there that she had to ask people how to work things that she never did anything. 

00:31:00
SCOTT MILLER Your -- your 

00:31:00
JENNIFER 20 years. 

00:31:00
SCOTT MILLER Your saying then that that the picture of somebody who is not capable of is a picture you agree with, you're not hopeful about some kind of change in her -- a dramatic change in status. 

00:31:10
JENNIFER  No, I'm not. 

00:31:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:31:15
JENNIFER But I'm saying also that I didn't know she was as incapable as she was. 

00:31:20
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:31:20
JENNIFER Because my father just did everything. 

00:31:20
SCOTT MILLER Cover that. 

00:31:20
JENNIFER Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:20
SCOTT MILLER  And then you've mentioned also several times that, I'm trying pull two desperate dots together here and see if it makes any sense to you that, she really wasn't the kind of mom that you hoped she would growing up. 

00:31:35
JENNIFER She was a witch, she was a witch. 

00:31:35
SCOTT MILLER Now don't mince words. 

00:31:35
JENNIFER  She was a bitchy witch. 

00:31:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:31:40
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:31:40
SCOTT MILLER Alright. You had hoped that she would have an opportunity to be something different or at least you became aware of that idea when she is complete -- when the possibility -- when the door is completely closed. 

00:31:50
JENNIFER  Yeah. 

00:31:55
SCOTT MILLER And so I begin to think, I wonder. 

00:31:55
JENNIFER Fairy godmother. 

00:32:00
SCOTT MILLER If she had been the kind of mother that you wanted her to be, what kind of daughter would you be to her now? Would you be any different than you are now? Would you be -- 

00:32:15
JENNIFER I would feel different. I mean, I probably would do what I'm doing, I don't think I could do anymore. 

00:32:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:32:20
JENNIFER But I would feel different. 

00:32:20
SCOTT MILLER Tell me some more about that. 

00:32:25
JENNIFER I would look at her and I mean I like actually I touched her, I kissed her head and I stroked her brow but I did it like we talk about forced empathy, I mean I did it like this is what you would do if you really love somebody and really cared and I'm going through the motions with her. And it looks like I really care but I'm forcing it, and I think I would feel it, how I'd feel the loss of my mother, if I had -- if I had the mother I wish I had and I where the daughter I would like to be. My friend Nena says that I have to be the daughter that -- I have to be the good daughter now because I'm a model for my daughter and for my daughter's daughter. And I thought that's true, I mean it's -- in a way that's true, I'm not doing it -- I'm not doing it for that reason, I'm doing it because there is no alternative, I mean, I had to call her everyday, three or four, five times a day because I couldn't live with myself otherwise, I was worried about her. I mean it was -- it was inevitable that she would fall again because she'd fallen before. But it's just a question of when and I was angry that she didn't move -- when my father died, that she didn't put the house on the market immediately, come up here, move into a retirement community that was really decent, Westwood Horizons was really nice and now of course that's now possible but it probably wasn't possible even at the time I just didn't know it. 

00:34:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Your friend says you have to be the daughter that you want your daughter to be. 

00:34:10
JENNIFER Well -- 

00:34:10
SCOTT MILLER You have to model for her. 

00:34:10
JENNIFER Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:15
SCOTT MILLER But it seems like the conflict is more with you, that you are not living up to some standard that you have that it bugs you and it bothers you that inside of you, there is this loving capable person and at this instance does not bring that out, am I off base here. 

00:34:30
JENNIFER  I wish there was this warm loving person inside. 

00:34:35
SCOTT MILLER For her? 

00:34:35
JENNIFER Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:40
SCOTT MILLER I mean yet it is hard to find that person now given what you've been through, given the way the life was. 

00:34:45
JENNIFER Yeah. And I can make it look like it. 

00:34:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:34:50
JENNIFER But I don't really feel it. 

00:34:55
SCOTT MILLER Alright. 

00:34:55
JENNIFER And it's disturbing. 

00:34:55
SCOTT MILLER  Are you surprised by yourself? 

00:35:00
JENNIFER In what way? 

00:35:05
SCOTT MILLER That it's -- that you don't feel it. 

00:35:10
[sil.] 

00:35:15
JENNIFER I think I should feel it. I mean, like there is something really wrong with me if I don't feel it. And I don't think that she knows that it's not real, I mean, that I'm only on her radar for a little while anyway and then I'm gone, I mean, it's like gone. 

00:35:35
SCOTT MILLER Right, right. There is something really wrong with you that you don't feel this way. 

00:35:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:35:45
SCOTT MILLER  When my mother was dying, my father -- I'd talked to the physician many times. And my father would say to me you know she is going to live. 

00:36:05
JENNIFER What she is dying of? 

00:36:05
SCOTT MILLER Lung cancer. And she would say – he would say she is going to live and then I would talk to the physician and she was dying. And I wanted to scream and what, you know, face facts, what the hell is going on around here. She is dying. Easy for me. You know, I wasn't – I didn't live with her for 55 years. I didn't know the intensity of the connection or emotion and such. 

00:36:40
JENNIFER  Yeah. 

00:36:45
SCOTT MILLER And then at times I was thinking also that I wish I would hurry up. This dying thing, it's taking over a long time. It's dragging on. 

00:37:00
JENNIFER How long did it take? 

00:37:00
SCOTT MILLER A year. 

00:37:00
JENNIFER A year. 

00:37:00
SCOTT MILLER She wasted her weight. 

00:37:05
JENNIFER So long time --. 

00:37:05
SCOTT MILLER She wasted her weight for truly nothing. And then I felt guilty about that. Here I'm wishing my own mother dead, which wasn't really the case either. 

00:37:20
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:37:25
SCOTT MILLER And here you're worried about not having the right feeling with your mother, you can take care of her, you can pat her and make all the appearance of love and affection. But mostly it feels like there is mostly anger. 

00:37:45
JENNIFER  It's more than, it's like distance, it's like I'm watching myself do this, you know, like I'm there, but I'm not there. And I'm thinking how long could this go on, it could go on for years. 

00:38:10
SCOTT MILLER That's what I thought. And how close do you want to get? 

00:38:15
JENNIFER I don't have any choice. 

00:38:15
SCOTT MILLER I don't know. 

00:38:20
JENNIFER You know, I could die, you know, that's --. 

00:38:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:38:20
JENNIFER That's the choice. I don't want to make that choice. 

00:38:20
SCOTT MILLER  Can you envision being closer to her. Is that something that's even possible at this point? Can you imagine that? 

00:38:35
JENNIFER To whom? Closer to whom? 

00:38:35
SCOTT MILLER  This person, this human being, person who was your mother. 

00:38:40
JENNIFER  You know, it's like when you say that I think, if I could say mommy, mommy, are you alright, that's like, it puts me in a infantile position again. And it puts me in a position where she can hurt me again. 

00:39:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:39:00
JENNIFER Say who, what? Who are you? 

00:39:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:39:00
JENNIFER  Yeah. I mean, I just I can't – I can't imagine it. 

00:39:10
SCOTT MILLER And I think you have at least for me spoken to the heart of the matter that the risk is being vulnerable to her at this point. 

00:39:25
JENNIFER She is not together. 

00:39:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:39:25
JENNIFER I mean, she is not a person. 

00:39:25
SCOTT MILLER  It may actually end up wounding you again. 

00:39:30
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:39:30
SCOTT MILLER Or further. 

00:39:35
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:39:35
SCOTT MILLER So why not keep her at a distance. 

00:39:35
JENNIFER  I'm think about how pathetic she looks lying with her big blue eyes, so glad see you, I'm so glad to see you. I say, who? Who were you glad to see, I mean, like me, you were never been glad to see me your whole life. But all of a sudden you're glad to see me, I mean, like I'm the only person – I'm the only person she has. And I'm not glad to see her. So you feel like how could you do this to me? How the hell could you do this to me to get me so cornered that I don't really have choices now. 

00:40:20
SCOTT MILLER You know, things we haven't dealt with always have this way of coming around, biting us in the ass again. 

00:40:25
JENNIFER Oh, God. 

00:40:25
SCOTT MILLER Interestingly not Jennifer, what you are saying to me is the distance has never worked ultimately. 

00:40:35
JENNIFER Yeah, because I'm still hurt. 

00:40:40
SCOTT MILLER So what peace can somehow be achieved in this after all the carnage, in these last moments where she either recognizes you or doesn't. It really does require something selfless. 

00:41:00
JENNIFER Like what? 

00:41:05
SCOTT MILLER Feeling it. 

00:41:05
JENNIFER  God. 

00:41:10
SCOTT MILLER Opening yourself to the hurt wounds that have been, I think bared in many ways dealt with appropriately I know for years, but here they all are again. Her vulnerability, her cantankerousness, her dependence, her never having, I mean, the kind of mom you wanted her to be and now here you are having to return what she never gave you in many ways. 

00:41:35
JENNIFER It's not fair. 

00:41:35
SCOTT MILLER  Am I making any sense? 

00:41:45
JENNIFER Yeah. And that's what feels. 

00:41:45
SCOTT MILLER  Yeah. I know you Jennifer, you're a bigger person than that. 

00:41:50
JENNIFER  Thanks so. 

00:41:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:55
JENNIFER  I hope so. 

00:42:00
SCOTT MILLER  Yeah. And that's interesting. Now you're not sure, about whether that's in you. 

00:42:15
JENNIFER Well, when I was watching myself struggle for that and she put her hand through – through the -- grab through the railing and I kissed her hand. And I could – director in me saying, do this, do this, do this, you know, look here. Um, I was wondering how I knew to do that. I mean, how did I know this struck her head. 

00:42:45
SCOTT MILLER  Well, it makes the hair stand up on my arms, because there is that there in you in the past what's been the reward for the impact there hasn't been much of one that's been mostly punishing, it sounds like. 

00:43:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:43:10
SCOTT MILLER  And frankly, I don't think this has anything to do with your daughters or modeling for them. 

00:43:25
JENNIFER No. 

00:43:25
SCOTT MILLER That would be still holding out hope for yourself. 

00:43:30
JENNIFER No, I'm not doing this for my daughter. No. Well, I'm this, because this is the only thing I could do. 

00:43:35
SCOTT MILLER  Of course. 

00:43:40
JENNIFER There isn't really no alternative. I couldn't live with myself. 

00:43:45
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:43:45
JENNIFER If I walk away. 

00:43:45
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:43:45
JENNIFER I mean, because I have other reason, other choice, I could just make her rewarded at this stage. 

00:43:50
SCOTT MILLER That's good. 

00:43:50
JENNIFER And just gave over. 

00:43:55
SCOTT MILLER And you could stop seeing her. And all of her lack of lucidity, you could just say, oh, well. She doesn't know anyway and you might be right. But you would know. 

00:44:05
JENNIFER I would know, true. Well, that's I mean, when I was saying before. 

00:44:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:44:10
JENNIFER I have to call her, because I have call her, because I couldn't live not calling her. I have to know she was alright. In fact, you know, the night that she had fallen, it didn't occur to me not to call security. I mean, it didn't occur, well, I mean, she is fallen, she has been way laid somewhere, don't do anything. And by tomorrow, it will all be over, I mean, it didn't even occur to me, I mean, like I was so intensively – intensely troubled, I mean, like where was she? And my fantasy was that she was on the floor, hearing the phone ringing, not being able to get to, but then it was just like – and I couldn't move myself, I couldn't physically go over there. 

00:44:55
SCOTT MILLER You were right. 

00:45:00
JENNIFER Yeah. I mean, it was inevitable though. It was inevitable that it would happen sooner or later. 

00:45:05
SCOTT MILLER And you are right, now. 

00:45:05
JENNIFER About what? 

00:45:05
SCOTT MILLER  About needing to attend her. 

00:45:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:45:10
SCOTT MILLER And be vulnerable to her even thought it feels like a rip-off, if I can use that expression. 

00:45:20
JENNIFER Yeah. It is a rip-off. 

00:45:20
SCOTT MILLER  If in fact, this is about her given to you, it's a rip-off. I don't know why I'm talking about this. My – a person I was closest to in my life, I would say, even more than my mother or my father was my maternal grandmother. And at 94, she had a stroke while out pulling the weeds in her garden. 

00:45:50
JENNIFER God. 

00:45:50
SCOTT MILLER She was bent over and apparently had the stroke. And actually she was given some treatment that probably worsen to her condition right in response to that stroke. But she ended up and this was a pioneer lady as she ended up in a nursing home for nine months. And people said things like she is no longer there, this is just her body, they were saying this. You know, she can't hear you, she doesn't understand what you're saying. And you had every week, every times a week I would go over and I'd sit her, now that's different, I was very close to her. But that time is actually something that I think a lot about, all everybody else was gone. That time with her those last nine months, every other week. That's something I think about and I'm glad about. 

00:46:55
JENNIFER She felt she knew when you were there. 

00:46:55
SCOTT MILLER I don't even care. I feel like that what I might be doing now or saying to myself on occasion, I can't think of her, because then I think of that last nine months when I let her sit in that place and rock. And you know, she developed bedsore or because you know, she just laid in the same vegetative position. 

00:47:15
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:15
SCOTT MILLER  And I think about, I couldn't live with myself. Now it was easier for me, because I had a very tight and I think loving relationship with her. I think it's even more challenging in your situation. But in many ways, it sounds like you know what you're going to do. 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:47:45
SCOTT MILLER And actually I think that's what this course I'm --. 

00:47:45
JENNIFER Yesterday, I was just thinking of. 

00:47:45
SCOTT MILLER You were? 

00:47:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:47:45
SCOTT MILLER  Say something more about that. 

00:47:50
JENNIFER Well, I was just thinking, you're ending up saying what we started out saying, which is this could take a long time and it's not going to look like much… 

00:47:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:47:55
JENNIFER … shit. Excuse the expression. 

00:48:00
SCOTT MILLER Well, in that respect, I think it'll look like a lot. And the danger in this is this that this course could go down. The real risk when things are flying about like this is that not only will things not get better, but they could potentially get worse. 

00:48:20
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:48:20
SCOTT MILLER  And I think that you're just driving really hard not to make sure it's worse a year from now, two years from now, three years from now. And I'm not sure what will happen with her. Well, it may all be surprised yet. 

00:48:40
JENNIFER  I mean, you think she should get better. 

00:48:45
SCOTT MILLER You never know. I don't know, I haven't heard any definitive evaluation of her cognitive status yet, free from drugs and contacts, you know. 

00:49:00
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:49:00
SCOTT MILLER Older folks get really confused like you were saying when they get moved around a lot, when they are on drugs. A simple urinary tract infection can cause all sorts of havoc. 

00:49:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:49:10
SCOTT MILLER And I'm sure, you're looking into those things, but for yourself, I think things could get worse by not attending to those things. 

00:49:15
JENNIFER Yeah. Well, I have to attend to them, I mean, I just have to – I can't not attend to them, injustice. 

00:49:25
SCOTT MILLER Whether you're vulnerable or not while doing so. 

00:49:25
JENNIFER  Yeah. Yeah. And how do you not be vulnerable. 

00:49:35
SCOTT MILLER You are, that's the thing. That's the thing that I think so clear. 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:45
SCOTT MILLER How about this, how about we take just a few minutes and we've had some people that are watching and maybe we could take a few minutes and hear what their ideas are… 

00:49:55
JENNIFER Yeah. Sure. 

00:49:55
SCOTT MILLER … and reflections are about this. Will that be alright with you? 

00:49:55
JENNIFER Sure. Sure. 

00:49:55
SCOTT MILLER And for me at least I would like you to be a full complete participant in this process. 

00:50:00
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:50:00
SCOTT MILLER Both saying yea to both what I've said and what may say or nay. 

00:50:05
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:50:05
SCOTT MILLER Or no, whatever about that, will that be okay? 

00:50:10
JENNIFER Sure. 

00:50:10
SCOTT MILLER  Thanks so much for joining Jennifer and I. Would you just give your first names if you are comfortable, if you want to give your last name that's okay as well. 

00:50:20
RUBERTA Ruberta. 

00:50:20
SCOTT MILLER Ruberta. 

00:50:20
JOHN And I'm John. 

00:50:20
SCOTT MILLER  John. Um, this is really a time for simple reflections you've been watching the entire conversation. Anything at all that comes to mind you heard about this that you want to say or share. 

00:50:35
RUBERTA Well, I'm struggling with a very similar situation not the same of course, but similar in that. I have a 97 year-old dad and just lost the mom two years ago. And this was a dad – this is a dad who was not the dad that I deserved or wanted either. And I think I've worked some of this out and maybe sharing some of this with Jennifer might be helpful. What I'm doing for my dad is really something I'm doing for myself, because I want to walk out away from this feeling. I did everything I possibly could have done and feel okay about it. And I'm trying to take care of myself as much as I'm trying to take care of him. And I think you and I share that first born responsible daughter syndrome and doing all the right things, we know how to do that in our sleep and we're both doing it in our sleep. But my awareness brings me to the point, well, whatever I do, I do it with the full heart, because I'm going to walk away from this saying, boy, I did that well and be proud of myself and it's – maybe it's selfish, I don't know. But it really helps to know that there is – there are many levels of purpose in what I do for my dad when I do it. 

00:52:00
JOHN I'm just, I like that there are many levels of purpose. I guess, I was thinking about your comment stopped that you're a bigger person than that. And I guess, I was just reflecting on that and thinking, we're all bigger than any one relationship that we have with one person, little one. There are many different relationships we might have with the same person… 

00:52:30
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:52:30
JOHN … at different times. And as you were talking about feeling that distance Jennifer, um, um, I was wondering, um, what you were remembering as the opposite of distance and where that exists for you because it sounded like what you were remembering was your mother as the virulent witch. And then seeing her as the baby and not, you know, and kind of as a baby needing vulnerable or needing care, it was hard to kind of offer that given that you are remembering this story of her as virulent witch. 

00:53:20
JENNIFER Yeah. That's true. 

00:53:20
JOHN And – but when I was thinking, the kind of questions that were coming to my mind were, um, where else did you get the stuff that is informing you now since it's that there may be parts of it that did connect with her at a different time. But there may be parts that they came from many other people. I was wondering about your dad here and what, you're kind of remembering about what he did for her. And maybe what he did for you and how that displaying, I mean you speaking, revert her about the role of responsible beautiful daughter. And the cultural knowledge that we all learn about these things, about how to play these kind of roles that somehow felt kind of a sort of distance obligation kind of role. But there was more to it than it seemed. Um, I mean, I was wondering for example, what your dad would say about what are you doing now, if he could see it. 

00:54:40
JENNIFER Well, he would say, I'm doing the right thing now. 

00:54:40
JOHN All right. 

00:54:40
JENNIFER  Yeah. Because that's what he would do. 

00:54:45
JOHN All right. 

00:54:45
JENNIFER Yeah. He said that I didn't beat everybody up like, she said, if he were here, he beat them up. 

00:54:50
JOHN Okay. 

00:54:50
JENNIFER For being so mean to me. 

00:54:50
JOHN Right. 

00:54:50
JENNIFER I didn't beat them up. 

00:54:55
JOHN Well, that's what she would say that he would do. 

00:54:55
JENNIFER Right. Right. 

00:54:55
JOHN You might – if you had his voice say something different right? 

00:55:00
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:55:00
JOHN So in a sense, I wonder if it feels closer to be honoring what he would do then to be honoring what the virulent witch would do. 

00:55:10
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:55:10
JOHN People would say all, you know. And I'm wondering, I mean, there are many other relationships I think that I suspect in your life that are a part of what you are drawing upon at this time that are not just to do with your mom. 

00:55:25
JENNIFER Yeah. Well, in a way, what just occurred to me is that whether I hadn't realized before my father modeled for me, I would be like my mom. 

00:55:35
JOHN Really? 

00:55:35
JENNIFER Yeah. I mean, like – like, I mean, it moves me to think I'm honoring what he would do. 

00:55:40
JOHN Is it? 

00:55:40
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:55:40
JOHN  Does that – what – like what does that do to think that? 

00:55:50
[sil.] 

00:55:55
JENNIFER Well, it makes it more right that I'm doing it. 

00:55:55
JOHN Is it? 

00:55:55
JENNIFER  Yeah. 

00:56:00
JOHN Is it sort of move it closer or --. 

00:56:00
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:56:00
JOHN You're talking about feeling distant from what you are doing in some way. 

00:56:05
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah, it make me enough strange. 

00:56:10
JOHN Okay. 

00:56:10
JENNIFER Yeah. I mean, it makes it like, it's the right thing to do, my father would do it. I learned from him how to do that. How to take care of her maybe – maybe he realized he was always damaged. And I didn't realize that. I mean, I just thought she was a witch, but he saw her as deficit somehow and protected her. I mean, I were thinking of him as protective instead of --. 

00:56:40
JOHN Did he see her as worth protecting --. 

00:56:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:56:45
JOHN Some of – some worth or some. 

00:56:45
JENNIFER  Yeah. Yeah. 

00:56:50
JOHN And that's how to see from your position. 

00:56:55
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:56:55
JOHN  Other one I would imply her either that you have to do anything, I don't want to – by the way that we are talking about it even suggests that there is any particular thing that is obligatory, you know, I think --. 

00:57:15
JENNIFER I think, I have to do it. I have to, but I cannot do it. 

00:57:15
JOHN Yes. 

00:57:15
JENNIFER I mean, I might not like doing it, but I cannot do it. But this puts me in touch with like just liking it less. 

00:57:25
JOHN Okay. 

00:57:25
JENNIFER Let me maybe not like him, but just liking it less. 

00:57:30
JOHN Or finding substance to know how to do it. 

00:57:30
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:57:30
JOHN Is it right. I mean, --. 

00:57:35
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:57:35
RUBERTA Or possibly not having that wall up while you're doing it. 

00:57:35
JENNIFER  Yeah. 

00:57:40
RUBERTA Because that takes energy and effort to --. 

00:57:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:57:45
RUBERTA And what you are doing takes a lot of energy in effort to maybe not having to do both at the same time might be helpful. I don't know. 

00:57:50
JENNIFER  Yeah. Yeah. Not having to keep up a wall and also not keep up a wall. 

00:57:55
RUBERTA  Right. 

00:58:00
JENNIFER It's just second. 

00:58:00
RUBERTA Right. 

00:58:00
JENNIFER Close, not close. Close, not close, you know. 

00:58:00
RUBERTA Would there any people in your life Jennifer that modeled this kind of caring for elders. Did you see your parents take care of your grandparents or no. 

00:58:20
JENNIFER No. 

00:58:20
RUBERTA  So somehow from within you just have this. 

00:58:25
JENNIFER Well, I know your mother died not too long ago, you just went to take care of your father. Marcia's on the camera, Marcia's mother is same age as my mother 89, on Christmas, Marcia is having a run up to, you know, Sacramento to take care of, I mean, like, you know, I didn't know your mother, so I'm sorry. I mean, like everybody I know has been through or is going through something like this around the same age. Most of my friends have already gone through this with their parents, their parents are dead. So it's come late for me when my father reached 90. 

00:59:05
RUBERTA Right. 

00:59:05
JENNIFER They were married 70 years. They were joined at the hip for 70 years. They have a letter from Bush saying, you two have been go with 70 years, congratulations. 

00:59:20
SCOTT MILLER I guess, as I – as I listened to all of this, but I'm – what I'm grateful for in some ways and what it can confirms for me a bit and I'd like to make this too terrible personal. But you said things during the interview that I found reassuring because I had thought them myself. 

00:59:35
JENNIFER  What? 

00:59:40
SCOTT MILLER What a burden this is? I mean, this is not something you're saying polite company really. That this is kind of burden that this is hard that in many ways you're having to give back the people who didn't really give to you making public things that frequently aren't sad. And yet, you're doing exactly from – either from knowing from your father or from other people, you're doing the right thing in spite of feelings to that. 

01:00:15
JENNIFER But the thing is that the argument is with the feelings, I mean, there is no argument with the doing, it's with the feelings about the doing. And that's all internal. And I didn't revise that, that's all – that's all with me. 

01:00:30
JOHN  I have something else I was wondering and that is that since the incident that you talked about, you know, the time when your mother moved from being able to care for herself and to being more like a baby, being wackier than she was, being more reliant on your care and others care, right. Um, I'm wondering, well, I was wondering kind of what has changed like what – like what – what have you learned in that time that's not what you learned when you were younger and from your relationship with her. But like, is there anything new that you've kind of developed, I mean, if you could tell the story of the development of that time. I mean, it just sounded to me like you've worked out a number of things. Okay. You've been struggling with how you feel about them. But you've kind of worked them out. You've actually taken any steps and learn things about how she needs to be cared for, whether it's the air conditioning or whether it's something else that you didn't know before. And I was wondering, is the value that you can identify in what you had learned in that time. 

01:01:55
JENNIFER I don't know, I mean, it's been -- what I've learned is that she was not escapable as I thought she was. Um, and that was kind of shocking me first. 

01:02:05
JOHN And therefore, you've been required to learn some things to do that she couldn't do. Is that right, I mean, is that fit? 

01:02:15
JENNIFER Well, now I'm being required to do doings that she can't do. 

01:02:15
JOHN  Right. 

01:02:20
JENNIFER I mean, that she can't take care of her banking, she never could take care of her banking. And I didn't know that, I didn't know. And in a sense, she must have had some – she must have learned at somewhere, at some level, because before the fall, before she – before seven weeks ago, we went down to the banks, we got me signed into all of our accounts. We did a power of attorney and she signed over a power of attorney to me. I mean, she did all of this on her own. So she must have known somewhere inside of her that she really wasn't capable, because she turned all it over to me, which also look, what's, in terms of conservatorship. First thing he asked is, do you have power of attorney. I said, yeah. Yes, I know what's power of attorney, I mean, she went me that Marcia drove with me, I couldn't drive at the time. And we struggled with her, she didn't have – she didn't have idea and we have to go and get idea at the Department of Motor Vehicles and waited on line for two hours. And ah. 

01:03:25
JOHN  So she actively put herself when you were kid. 

01:03:30
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So she must have known more than I knew that she wasn't capable. 

01:03:40
JOHN So does that mean, you have had to learn to be – to do that caring, but you didn't know – anyone expecting it completely, it's term and you have to -- I don't know, I'm just curious. 

01:03:55
[sil.] 

01:04:00
JENNIFER I don't know. I don't know, I'm learning it now. 

01:04:05
JOHN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:04:05
JENNIFER That I have to do with caring. 

01:04:05
JOHN You know, and you had feel about it and what it feels like and --. 

01:04:10
JENNIFER  Yeah. Yeah. 

01:04:15
JOHN It sound that's good and awful. 

01:04:15
JENNIFER  Yeah. The women who shares the room with her at the skilled nursing facility, said to me, last time I was there, well, two nights ago, yeah, two nights ago, before last. She said to me, don't worry, you come here as often as anybody does. I'm asking what, she reading my mind? And she said from our perspective, we wish someone will come every day, but you come here as often as anybody does. And that was relieving and then she said to me, and I can tell, you have the heart for it. 

01:05:00
JOHN Oh! 

01:05:00
JENNIFER And I thought, she seeing the picture of mine just stroking her head and kissing her hand. 

01:05:05
RUBERTA What it was --. 

01:05:05
JENNIFER But she was actually, she was noticing. 

01:05:15
JOHN What she noticing? 

01:05:15
JENNIFER She was noticing what was showing, but also maybe what wasn't showing. But I wanted to – I wanted to – I wanted to. 

01:05:30
JOHN Yeah. 

01:05:30
JENNIFER Yeah. I was working at it. 

01:05:30
JOHN That it was --. 

01:05:30
JENNIFER Maybe that's what I'm learning, yeah. 

01:05:35
RUBERTA Okay. There was another little piece from me and I don't know if that's – any of that's of you. And I quote, there was a revise syndrome and that I was a terrified little girl for a lot of years, because my father was so enormous. And now that I see him frail and needy and dependent, I'm realizing that he was just this man with all these sweets and whistles and lights and you know, that loud voice that the Wizard of Oz had and he was behind a screen. 

01:06:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

01:06:10
RUBERTA And it was his own fear that he was trying to cover up. And my hunch is that your mother was so vulnerable and so needy and dependent that all of that screaming and yelling that she put on you really had to do with that little voice of the Wizard of Oz -- that female version of the Wizard of Oz. 

01:06:30
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah. 

01:06:30
RUBERTA And I was saying, I have to put up this big front, people aren't going to take me seriously. But you're not a little girl anymore and neither am I. 

01:06:40
JENNIFER  Yeah. Yeah. 

01:06:45
SCOTT MILLER  Okay. Let's pause here. 

01:06:50
JENNIFER Yeah. 

01:06:50
SCOTT MILLER And thank you very much. 

01:06:55
JENNIFER Thank you. 

01:06:55
SCOTT MILLER And then let's reconvene in just a minute. 

01:07:00
JENNIFER Okay. 

01:07:00
SCOTT MILLER I just have some final thoughts. I just wanted to give you a chance to say if anything occurred to you with response to the people's reflections, any summary kinds of things. And then I have a comment about that. 

01:07:15
JENNIFER Well, both Ruberta and John had very important things to say to me. 

01:07:15
SCOTT MILLER  Okay. 

01:07:20
JENNIFER I mean, it was very important. Seeing my mother as the Wizard of Oz isn't really true. And like I just said my father was a hero for that thing that he allowed her to bluff and buster and you know, and do all of that and make it look like she was in charge when she was in fact a frighten kid. And – and the idea that from my father I got the modeling, there wasn't – it was nobody, there was my father. 

01:07:55
SCOTT MILLER  Yeah. 

01:08:00
JENNIFER And I blamed him, a lot in my life for putting up with her. And right now, I'm seeing this heroic for putting up with her. That will be for putting up with a preferred, for elevating her. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:08:30
SCOTT MILLER It seems like the Wizard is sending you on the same journey that the ten man and the scarecrow everybody else went on. 

01:08:35
JENNIFER  I really want a heart. 

01:08:40
SCOTT MILLER And the message of the movie, but you already had one. What you needed was a symbol, right? 

01:08:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

01:08:45
SCOTT MILLER And that's what I wrote down here in addition to the three things you've just mentioned, I wrote down that you do have the heart for it. We're confirming that right now in here. 

01:08:55
JENNIFER Yeah. 

01:08:55
SCOTT MILLER And to me that the reason I feel that way is because if you had warm loving feelings to your, towards your mother, this would not be the large active love it is now. The large active love happens when you have to sacrifice… 

01:09:15
JENNIFER Yeah. 

01:09:15
SCOTT MILLER … when it's not easy. 

01:09:20
JENNIFER Yeah. 

01:09:20
SCOTT MILLER When you're giving something like you're intending to give in spite of that not having come your way a whole lot from her. So your heart, you do have the heart for it. And I'm real grateful for letting – for you letting me talk with you about it today. 

01:09:40
JENNIFER Thank you. 

01:09:40
SCOTT MILLER You know, I have one more brief form. 

01:09:45
JENNIFER Okay. 

01:09:45
SCOTT MILLER You remember, this is the end of session scale. 

01:09:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

01:09:45
SCOTT MILLER And this just says, it helps me understand how you felt like things went today. It looks at several different dimensions of the conversation. One is, how well we did together, whether you felt heard and understood and respected. Whether we worked on what you came here to work on and talk about and how it felt this way of working, was it right? And overall, was it a good fit or was there something missing? It's filled out essentially the same way. 

01:10:20
JENNIFER Okay. And let's see – can't get over here. Let's see. 

01:10:30
[sil.] 

01:10:35
SCOTT MILLER We're all done here. 

01:10:40
JENNIFER Okay. 

01:10:40
SCOTT MILLER Thanks, Jennifer. 

01:10:40
JENNIFER Okay. Thank you.
