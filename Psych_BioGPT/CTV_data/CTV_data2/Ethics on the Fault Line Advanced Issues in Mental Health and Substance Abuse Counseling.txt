PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ I'm very pleased to do so Thom. 

00:01:30
THOM PANCELLA Let's start with the title, "Ethics on the Fault Line." Why Ethics on the Fault Line? 

00:01:35
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Well, this, ah-- that title, I was inspired by the first workshop I did, ah, last April in St. Louis, ah, on Frontline Ethics. Ah, that warning of that workshop around 4:30, uhm, all of us in the St. Louis area were arouse by earthquake. So that was kind of an auspicious beginning to, ah, of the, ah, the workshop on Frontline Ethics. And then when I was thinking about, uhm, what to call the, the next workshop in-- that would build on Frontline Ethics, I thought, well, that's a good-- that would be a good title "Ethics on the Fault Line." Ah, why that? Well, because we're looking at issues that are more complicated and difficult and they made shake us up in terms of how we feel about that or leave us feeling queasy as to whether or not e-- ah, course of action we followed was, what we might call the right one. And of course, that's the, the difficulty with ethics, uhm, a-- aside from the, the, the strict prohibition in all ethical codes than I have sex with ones clients. Ethics, ah, is really a lot of brave. And it's about making decisions. Uhm, ah, we can define an ethical dilemma as, uhm, ah, situation in which I have two or more reasons for making two or more reasonable decisions about something. And in that process, one of the ethical principle is going to be compromised. So there is no way to do it in what we might call, right. In other words, ethics for the most part is not a black and white matter. It's, ah, there's a lot of great area involved in that. 

00:03:15
THOM PANCELLA So what would be the purpose of the, the Code of Ethics then? 

00:03:15
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Well, I think the, ah, the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, ah, probably says at best and would say it for o-- many of the professions of not all of them. And that is the, the-- a Code of Ethics, ah, allows a profession to identify what they consider to be the core values of the profession. For example in social work those-- some of those core values or service, justice, ah, the dignity and worth of the person, the importance of human relationships also just some of them. Ah, it summarizes principles that reflect those core values. So coming out of those core values, ah, ah, a profession can talk about what it considers its, ah, its principles that flow from that. And then from the principles flow the actual, ah, code itself. The, ah, code establishes specific standards to guide practice. Ah, a lot of times, ah, practices, ah, indeed complicated or these great areas and so a code stands there as a way to really help the practitioner, ah, kind of make a decision about which way to go in a case where it's not necessarily so clear or obvious. Ah, the code also identifies the relevant issues when there are those times when professional, ah, obligations conflict, ah, or ethical uncertainties are present. And, and that can happen. So, ah, the code really helps the practitioner to kind of, ah, work his or her way through that and, and come with decision. The other, uhm, purpose of the-- of a code is to give the general public standards to which they can hold the profession accountable. So for example, ah, if we take the NASW Code of Ethics, anybody can visit the, uhm, the website, www.socialworkers.org and look up the Code of Ethics and find out what social workers are at least supposed to be doing in the eyes of the-- one of the major professional organizations. And most other organizations if you visit the American Psychological Association, the American Counseling Association you would also have access to their Codes of Ethics. Another purpose is to socialize practitioners knew to the field. And the interesting thing about all the professions whether you're a doctor, or nurse, or teacher, or an attorney, a social workers, or counselor, professionals all have their very first time to do something. There-- there's no way to be come that without having your first time. So the whole process is really one of becoming a professional not just practicing. Ah, because a profession really involves the whole person not just something I do on the side as, ah, kind of a side-light to my life. But it really something that I integrate into my whole life. Not in the sense that I'm gonna practice on my family or friends, but that my, my-- how I comfort myself, ah, in the public, ah, corresponds with, ah, the way I hold myself out as the-- as a professional person. Ah, because it-- this is public information that people can find out that I'm a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, they can visit the state website and look up my, my license and, and find that information out. So I wanna help those who are newly to the field, those just graduating from, uhm, from school with the-- either the Bachelor of Social Work or Master of Social Work to learn what it means to, to be a social worker. And then the, ah, the code articulates the ethical standards to assess practitioner's conduct. In other words, the profession as the body establishes its own Code of Ethics. So there is some variation from profession to profession. Uhm, for example the Substance Abuse Professionals in Missouri, our Code of Ethics is very short. It's on an 8Â½ by 11 piece of paper, it has 13 points. Ah, the NASW Code of Ethics is 20 pages or more. Ah, the Psychologist Code of Ethics is lengthen. Ah, probably reflecting the length of time, those professions have been around, because I noticed that the longer a profession exist the more complicated as Code of Ethics becomes. And that's due to the profession reflecting on its experience and practice and then deciding on principles and standards by which to guide those people who are coming into the, into the field. So if a professional violates, uhm, the, ah, Code of Ethics in someway, ah, the profession already has in place the standard, and that's the whole process that the professions go through without one person doing and it's usually a very comprehensive process to arrive with those standards. 

00:08:10
THOM PANCELLA You've referring the best to, to templates. What is the, what is the template? 

00:08:15
Examine Think Hypothesize Identify Consult Personal Societal Agency Client Professional 

00:08:15
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Ah, template is a, is a, is a way of, ah, going about a process of ethical reasoning. Since the Code of Ethics do not have-- are not filled with, uhm, a lot of prohibitions, there has to be someway of approaching an ethical dilemma and reasoning my way through that. So, ah, one way to do that is to have laid out the process in what we call a template. In other words, a, a sys-- a systematic way of reviewing the ethical dilemma. Ah, I happened to be particularly fund of one that Elaine Congress developed and the, the Brown School reprinted and it's a practical, uhm, newsletter, ah, several years ago. And that's called the Ethic Template. It takes the word ethic, and uses it as an acronym which is helpful. Who-- you know, that I don't have to go running to, you know, amb-- ah, the literature to, to try to figure this out or introduce remember ethic. And, ah, so the-- this is what the, the letters stand for. The E stands for examine, the T for Think, the H for Hypothesize, the I identify, and C consult. So this allows me to go through this process. And what am I going to examine that, that E part? What am I examining? I really examine values. And there are five different areas of values that I would take a look at. For example personal, societal, uhm, agency, client, and professional and that's really a brainstorming kind of step. Just to kind of off the top of my head, "Okay, what are the values I hold? What about the organization I worked for? What about society, the client, the profession, and so on? The, uhm, to think-- ask me to think about what ethical standard applies in this particular, ah, case that I'm thinking about. So I would actually look at the Code of Ethics and, and see what does it have to say about this particular matter. The H stands for hypothesize in there, what am I hypothesizing about or the possible consequences of different decisions. If I go this way, what might happen? If I go this way, what might happen? The I'd-- I, identify stands for identifying who will be helped and who will be harmed, uhm, in light of-- in this case, we would say social works commitment to those who are most vulnerable. Now other professions might not have that caveat on the end but social work particularly looks at people who are, are very vulnerable. So I-- why do I think about that, you know? Identify who's gonna be helped, who's gonna be harmed in, ah, in light of, of this decision. And C consult. The first line of consultation is with one supervisor. Now people who are in private practice or have been practicing for a lot of years, they may not have a supervisor. But it's extremely beneficial to have colleagues with whom one can consult. And to be doing that on a regular basis not just when an emergency, ah, comes up. So, ah, let me just give you an idea of how, ah, template might be used. Ah, this is, ah, I've been yet that's drawn from, ah, the booklet put up by NASW, it's called Current Controversies in Social Work Ethics, case examples. So they give you a various examples and then refer to this specific, uhm, ah, areas of the code that apply, and then have a commentary on that. So this is a case where there's a multifamily service agency that's had a successful substance abuse treatment program for 25 years. So the board of directors and a committee of staff are working to plan an anniversary celebration, okay? So now the, the purpose of this will be to interpret their services to the larger community. Uhm, ah, that's available and o-- of course coming from that is the possibility of recruiting clients and of getting favorable publicity to launch a new fund-raising drive. Okay. And who can't always use money assistant particular agency is expanding. Now because there are so many positive outcomes of a service delivery, the agency wants to contact all former clients, ah, for whom they still have valid addresses to invite them to provide testimony regarding, ah, services and to participate in a festivities. Now interestingly enough, so if we would begin with the E, we would examine the values and just run through that brainstorming. Well, we're going to think about the Code of Ethics in the NASW Code of Ethics, believe it or not there's a section ad-- addresses this. Okay. This is to see effect experience over the years, okay. So, ah, we would go to that part of the Code of Ethics and see what does this have to say. Well, there is a section, ah, 4.07 that talks about solicitations. And there are two parts to it and one is that, social workers should not engage in uninvited solicitations of potential clients because there are circumstances, are vulnerable to undue influence manipulation or coercion. So that's one piece of it. But the second part really pertains to this particular, uhm, dilemma of the agency that wants to contact its former clients. This, ah, part of the code says, social workers should not engage in solicitation of testimonial endorsements including solicitation of consent to use a client's prior statement as a testimonial endorsement from current clients or from other people who, because of their particular circumstances, are vulnerable to undue influence. So what sets up the dilemma here is the use of the word "current". And the fact that this is a substance abuse treatment, uhm, program. So certainly within the context of the community a, ah, an agency or an organization that delivers good service is providing a service to the community. And I know that there are a number of people in the substance abuse treatment field, uhm, really believe that, uhm, the idea that treatment works gets very little coverage, ah, that me-- very often what people are focusing on or the, the headlines in the newspaper or somebody who was drunk, killed somebody on the highway. Ah, but there is not-- there is very little front page news that says, "Oh, you know, over 25 years these many people have been helped that are-- and they're in recovery." Okay, so that's one piece of it. And certainly it's clear that they would not get these testimonials from current clients. There is a prohibition. This question revolves around, what about the former clients? Are they still in a vulnerable position? And when we-- and when I think about, ah, substance abuse treatment, that person might be-- they might have enter treatment there, uhm, with, ah, not many people knowing that they had that problem. So if they're invited to come out now and to do that, they might be being invited to disclose something that they really would rather not disclose. And even though a person might give their consent, this is where it gets tricky. Because I-- if-- let's see I've received service from you. There may be a part of me that feels a kind of an obligation to you. Okay. Well, you did a nice thing for me. Maybe I should do this for you. And well, we really aren't equals even though I finish treatment. And in order to have that kind of relationship, we need to be equals but I-- there's something about this that says, I'm really not. Uhm, and the, the other difficulty-- this is when I have just personally with the-- with soliciting from somebody whose a former client of a, ah, alcohol or drug treatment program is the problem of relapse. Uhm, alcoholism and drug addiction are prone to relapse. And this could inadvertently have the, the unintended opposite effect if one of these clients would appear in, in something publicizing this, ah, this treatment program and then later relapse. So what, what then would it say? Okay. So that's-- this is where it all gets kind of tricky, and you need that process to, to sort this out. 

00:17:20
THOM PANCELLA Well, it gets interesting because I, I do hear commercials even for, ah, treatment programs that are set up with family members or in, ah, - 

00:17:30
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Uh-hmm. 

00:17:30
THOM PANCELLA - other people who have been through the program or currently in the-- in programs. 

00:17:30
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Uh-hmm. 

00:17:30
THOM PANCELLA Ah, does that speak to that as well? 

00:17:35
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Yes, it does. Ah, in fact, I was in a, a National Conference last year and I had gotten a pretty glitzy, uhm, brochure about a treatment, uhm, program for adolescence in another state. And this particular organization had its booth set up, ah, at this National Conference and so I went by. Because when I got the brochure, I, I went through it, ah, pro-- with the fine-tooth comb to find a disclaimer that these were not clients used in this brochure. I didn't find that disclaimer. So I went up to the person in the booth and I said, "Please, tell me that these are not actual clients in your brochure." And the answer was, "Well, there are some of them where." Now to me that's problematic. Uhm, you know, especially for talking about young people was-- or at really any person. We cannot see into the future, ah, in terms of what somebody might choose to do in terms of a profession, ah, or how they live their, their lives. And especially somebody who might be interested later on and going into the public sphere, let's say, uhm, political office or, or something like that. So I'm, I'm just, ah, this is me personally. I'm very, ah, rigid on holding the confidentiality of clients. Uhm, it seems to me there is another way to produce a brochure or an article and that is to let, uhm, people stand in and then make that disclaimer. And I've certainly seeing that for other treatment programs where there'll be a nice article about the treatment program and what it does. And then they show pictures of people in groups, and so fort. And there is a disclaimer at the end that says, none of the people shown in this photographs are clients. 

00:19:30
THOM PANCELLA Do you think that is, is effective? 

00:19:30
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Well, apparently some, ah, board of directors and, and agencies don't think so. For some reason that they want people to see real clients. But if you're looking at it from the prospective of a client, I think the client might be more in client to go to some place where they know their, their privacy is going to be protected rather than some place that doesn't care, uhm, about them. So-- but whether or not it's-- which, which is most effective, I don't know. Probably most people are looking at those pictures and they're not looking at the further disclaimer like I am. That's my own particular, particular thing. I've to watch out that I want become the ethics police. 

00:20:15
THOM PANCELLA Well, that's an interesting, an interesting point too. Because e-- it's, it's the what do you do with it that then I think, ah, comes into play then now you-- you've, you've faced the situation like this or you immersed in a situation like this, what is it that you do with that situation? 

00:20:30
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Yeah. And that's, that's of course the process of ethical decision-making. And here where you have an agency, uhm, e-- and this does become, uhm, more complicated ethical reasoning because let's say on this agency we have a multidisciplinary staff. And each of those disciplines, it has a different Code of Ethics. So they may not have a section in their code that, ah, like the one in the NASW Code. You have a board of directors, generally those are, uhm, laypeople in the sense of they're not, they're not professionals delivering services. Ah, they may be the head of a co-- a company or another program in a, in a community. So they're not really-- they're not bound to follow that Code of Ethics. Ah, what they're there to do is to promote the agency and if they cannot raise money and, and build a new facility or, or, or have funds, they could be out of business or have to limit their services. That's what makes the such of dilemma. 

00:21:35
THOM PANCELLA I think it also makes a dilemma that we talks on earlier is that, people are of this different disciplines, cuz we've talked about when there is a substance abuse treatment but you can have addressing it from the social workers perspective and say this is, this is clearly or-- more, more or less clearly defined at the social workers Code of Ethics but necessarily as much themselves... 

00:21:50
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Yes. Because if I look at the Missouri Substance Abuse Professionals Code of Ethics you don't say anything about that in there, okay. Ah, the other thing is that, our-- the, ah, application of ethics is also very context dependent. Ah, some issues that would be let's say, more easily resolved in an urban area like the Metropolitan, St. Louis area might not necessarily be so easily resolved in outstate Missouri or in rural communities where services are limited, uhm, or the, the treatment staff is involved, uhm, perhaps in recovery themselves and they go to let's say, AA meetings in the community and their clients are those same meetings. So it gets more complicated, ah, as you move into areas where there is as-- are fewer people. 

00:22:40
THOM PANCELLA Can you give us more examples, some of your favorite stories? 

00:22:45
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Uhm, yes. This one is not as complicated. This is, this is, is one is fairly a clear-cut and I pull this one from a Fred Reamer's book on, uhm, social work ethics. And looking at the NASW Code, this is a case where a, a person, ah, this woman obtains her MSW, her Master of Social Work after she is obtained a doctorate in Biology. Okay, so she's making a career change. And after she is received her degree in social work she was hired as a case worker in a family services agency and then later started a private practice. So in their marketing materials, ah, and on her letterhead the social worker list herself as doctor or PhD and referred to herself as a doctor in conversations with clients and others. So the problem here is that you have to represent yourself accurately. Ah, this one really is not so much with dilemma as, as an ethical issue that needs to be resolved, ah, with this person. The-- you, you hold out as your current credential. The one which allows you to practice. PhD is in biology, do not deliver therapy services unless they have a NASW and they're trained to do that. So it's not the, it's not the doctorate. That is the, is the practice degree here, it's the MSW. And that so, she really has to withhold the information about the PhD, because it's irrelevant to the practice. Now somebody who has, uhm, a-- an NASW that goes on for a PhD for example is social work or marriage and family therapy. Those are practice degrees. Ah, that person can fairly represent themselves as having, ah, a doctorate, I call themselves doctor, ah, with no problem because they, they are actually qualified to practice with those degrees. But just because I have a degree in another field doesn't mean I can, ah, call myself that. I can use myself as an example cuz you mentioned at the beginning I have a Master of Arts and Religion and Education from St. Louis University. That's just information, that is not a practice degree at least not for therapy. Okay. It, it qualifies me because of its, ah, components of both religion and education to may be, uhm, you know, do some things in my perish. And it helped to me as a teacher because of the education part of it. But I don't represent to my clients that I have that degree because that's not the degree under which I'm practicing. So I don't put that diploma on the wall. It's not relevant to the work that I'm actually engaged in now. 

00:25:40
THOM PANCELLA And it sounds like the, the stories can go on and on because the, the approaches are always so great. 

00:25:45
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Yes, they are. And, ah, the, the stories could go on. And I also though and you know, when you asked me question like that I have to pause because some of the stories I know, ah, because of the community and how the material that we're producing here will be used. I, I need to protect the confidentiality of people and if I haven't given its sufficient thought or obtained somebody's permission, then I really can't use it. 

00:26:10
THOM PANCELLA On the early you talked about people supervisors are being kind of the frontline of, ah, defense against this stuff. Ah, what are some resource that we can have people have with? 

00:26:20
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Well, it's interesting. The, the-- ah, in social work, the, uhm, the state committee that licensed a social workers, ah, following up on a change in the law is now going to require supervisors to have-- I believe at least 16 continuing education hours in supervision. So the supervisors on a very key role in, uhm, ah, in, in this process of, uhm, inducting people in-- into the profession. So certainly, the continuing education offerings that are around. And I can get that as a social worker. Let's say, when I go to the NASW Missouri Chapter annual conference there are various workshops there on, on different issues. And, uhm, it's really, uhm, important to me to be a member of my professional organization. Uhm, there is a benefit to that, uhm, aside from being able to, uhm, to pay for, ah, a, a reasonable amount for malpractice insurance cuz we're pulled, ah, together. Uhm, as a member I can do an ethics consultation with, ah, NASW a-- as a member of benefit. So they have an 800 number to call, they have hours of operation and I can call and talk to somebody there. The thing I need to understand about any kind of ethics consultation is they're not going to tell me what to do. All right. Whether that's a, a colleague or a supervisor or a, ah, or somebody at the National Office. They're going to help me with the process of reasoning and working my way through with dilemma. And I think that's an important, ah, element to keep in mind. That when we're talking about ethics and the application of Codes of Ethics, we're talking about a process. And that's what I'm responsible for. If, if you call into question, a decision that I've made, I have to be able to explain how I got to that position. And I better be able to say, "Well, did I did this, and this, and this, and this?" And certainly if I follow the template, I can say, "Well, this is what I did." And now, somebody may disagree with the decision I came to. But they're gonna have a hard time disagree with my process particularly if I followed that whole process through beginning to end. 

00:28:50
THOM PANCELLA And the substance abuse counselors have similar resources? 

00:28:55
PEGGY J. KEILHOLZ Ah, they-- I think can contact the, ah, their professional credentialing board. And I know they also now have a requirement, ah, to have to so many hours in substance abuse ethics. I remember when I first took my certification there, I had to have a certain number of hours. I forgotten how many it was. Specifically in, ah, ethics as related to substance abuse counseling. Because another part of ethical reasoning is looking state and federal laws, and state and federal regulations. And I just had this conversation recently with, ah, someone, ah, over somebody, you know, receiving and, uhm, receiving service under an AEP and alcoholism being involved. And I said to the person, well, you need to understand that there are fe-- federal regulations which are very stringent that govern to disclosure of information regarding alcohol and drug treatment, so that is to be part of your process as well. Ah, you can't just disclose information, ah, you, you have to look at a number of things what's the, what's the contract who made the referral, what's the expectation or release the signed and, and so fort. And, ah, my understanding is that, it was, ah, very important for, uhm, in-- when the federal laws were first passed about relating to treatment for alcohol and drugs that there'll be sufficient protection so that people would not be discourage from seeking treatment. So that's why those are, are more stringent provisions then might exist on the, the state or, or, uhm, or local level. I wish I had more knowledge about where the substance abuse counselors could, could call by the start with this state credentialing body and, uhm, and asked, ah, you know, what, what they would recommend if somebody is really faced with that dilemma. Of course, on their own agency or treatment center would be, ah, another line of, ah, an avenue of looking at, uhm, ah, resolving an ethical dilemma.
