00:00:00
What is Pop Culture? 

00:00:00
JULIE TILSEND PH.D. What is pop culture to each of you? When you see that written or hear someone say pop culture, what comes to mind for you guys? What sorts of things? 

00:00:50
Nick 

00:00:50
NICK When I think of pop culture, I think of hip hop. I think of art. I think of techno, I think of any type of music, any type of art, dance. Just everything. 

00:01:00
Grace 

00:01:00
GRACE Like, when I think pop culture, I think of music mostly and Hollywood and stuff but then also, like, Facebook and texting and things like that. So... 

00:01:10
JULIE TILSEND PH.D. Would you say that, um, Facebook and texting, are they a little bit, medium, or kind of super-sized being important or central in your life right now? 

00:01:20
GRACE Um, they are very important in my life right now. 

00:01:25
JULIE TILSEND PH.D. Yeah. 

00:01:25
GRACE I'm always either texting someone or on Facebook, so... 

00:01:25
JULIE TILSEND PH.D. Okay. 

00:01:25
Sheila 

00:01:25
SHEILA When I kind of think of pop culture, it's kind of like it's a projection of what, like, real life is, just only, like, a little bit amplified. I feel like they use ideas from, like, the actual society and they use it to project it, to make it bigger. 

00:01:45

00:01:45
TANGO Um, I feel that pop culture is really what comes out of Hollywood, what's in the mainstream, what, what is being projected into our American culture. You know, some viral video on YouTube to some performance piece or a song or a film, whatever. The fashion industry is really portraying, like, this is what the look of today is. A lot of people really try to portray that look, whatever it is, no matter how stupid it may be sometimes. A lot of people may not use their critical minds to really analyze something. Think oh, it's popular. I might as well get into it so, like, all the cool kids are doing it so I might, I may as well and I think it can really destroy a person in that way.

WORLD OF WARCRAFT 

00:02:30
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. When we're referencing pop culture, popular culture, we mean many things that, um, are products of, uh, popular culture, media culture, um, the culture industries and so specifically that can mean things. Um, everybody look at what you're wearing. Is there a label on the outside of something you're wearing. It can be fashion. It's music, it's film, TV. It's social media. Um, so Facebook, uh, technology, computer, YouTube, chats, um, all those things that we consume, uh, it, by ourselves and in relationship that we will talk about, um, contribute to our identities in some ways. Um, so when we talk about popular culture, we do mean it very broadly. It could be even things that you eat. Uh, if you've got a coffee cup right now with a white label on it. You know, so things like that. Everything from clothes to music to, to videos to, to games, video games, so for gamers. All those things are encompassed, uh, under the, the umbrella of popular culture, media culture, the culture industries. 

00:03:50
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. I would, I would add, 'cuz it's popular culture, it, um, is various, um, uh, practices or texts that are, are shared amongst a group of people, so their popular and, uh, popular culture to me also refers to a text, a text meaning anything that produces meaning. So it's not neutral. It shapes meaning. It shapes identity. 

00:04:20
Why is it important for therapists/counselors to be familiar with Pop Culture? 

00:04:25
[sil.] 

00:04:25
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Uh, we, we think it's very important, in fact almost, uh, of primary importance in the work with everybody and, in this case, particularly with youth, um, in a mass media culture, in a consumer-based, uh, society, uh, popular culture is one of the primary influences on identity construction. 

00:04:45
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. I think we were interested in hearing more of everybody's thoughts around what Dave and I would call this, this, idea of identity and how what you wear, what you listen to, what you watch, what you buy, um, what you do in popular culture says something about who you are. 

00:05:05
SHEILA I have a huge problem with how African American women are presented. Like a huge, huge problem. When I go to school, and at my school, there's a majority of Caucasians and they have an idea that all black women are really loud, obnoxious, ghetto, weave throwing, all that type of stuff and then when they see me and I don't act that way, I kind of act as a proper way. Like, I don't want it perceived as that. Like I make it known not to perceive it as that, they wanna call me an Oreo, white on the inside, black on the outside, and I don't like that just because they're trying to put a label on me. It's like, since you're not that ghetto black person, then you are an Oreo. Like, why can't I just be a person that, you know, finishes her sentences and doesn't scream at people. They won't get the chance to know me before, like, they put a label on me first. 

00:06:00
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. And are you, in what ways are you getting the idea that their ideas about how African American women are supposed to be are coming from pop culture. 

00:06:10
SHEILA I know. Like when I see, there's like YouTube videos out there where it's funny but, like, girls are acting really ghetto, like (inaudible ) and, like, acting really crazy and it's kind of like that and they kind of get the preconceived notion that that's how it's supposed to be. Yeah. 

00:06:35
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. That can kind of like, it sounds like it's, um, an example of popular culture creating in people's minds how the world is and then they're not looking at the world and interacting with, in this case, African American women to see how the many ways African American women go through the world. 

00:06:55
SHEILA Yeah. 

00:06:55
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. They, this popular culture has created an idea from them and they expect you to conform to that. 

00:07:00
SHEILA Yeah. And when they don't see that, they get scared and label. 

00:07:05
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:07:05
SHEILA They don't get to know, they judge, which is actually true for any type of, a lot of races, really. 

00:07:10
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:07:10
SHEILA So... 

00:07:10
NICK One thing I don't like about stereotype that I get is I get, well, I get many different stereotypes. I get stereotyped for when I'm acting polite, I get stereotyped for being uptight. I get stereotyped when I'm with my brother 'cuz he, we live or my dad lives out in Blaine with my little brother. So that's more of a suburban area, so I'm, like, kinda the odd one out the bunch, not to mean anything, but what one of his friends said to me the other day had me think about it. Like, we were talking, we were all downstairs in the basement and we were all just talking and whatever and I, we were talking about vacations. I told 'em we just went down to South Carolina so he asked for what? I said my aunt died and I was kinda, tragic situation and I was kinda upset and he said to me, he said, he said wow I'm surprised you were sad. He's like, I thought black people just get more mad, get more angry. So that had me thinking like, do people actually really think like that or is, do some people think that he can be caring, he can be nice, he can be the person we wanna hang around with. 

00:08:25
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Yeah. What are your ideas, like, about how perhaps media and popular culture's representations of black men influence your friend's idea that you'd only get mad rather than get sad? You were talking about this earlier I think. You know, what's some of the music and how, how are black men represented there? Is there ever a story of sadness? 

00:08:55
NICK (crosstalk) Um, I, um, yeah. 

00:08:55
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Do you gotta go looking for those? 

00:08:55
NICK Yeah, you gotta, you gotta look for 'em 'cuz they're... 

00:09:00
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. You gotta know where to look for different kind of music. 

00:09:00
NICK 'Cuz I can't really find, uh, music, like, that I wanna listen to, like soul, so I listen to people like, like I've listened to Amy Winehouse, to be honest with you. 

00:09:10
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Is, is some of that that stereotype stuff you, that you think some of that music might give people ideas that black men only get mad? 

00:09:20
NICK Yeah, like the other day I'm bump, I had my headphones out and my brother tried to tell me turn the music down. He was like, my brother, he was like, we're here with white people, turn the music down. I'm like then let me play it louder. 

00:09:35
TANGO In pop culture, there's a lot of, like you have to constrict into these set lines, lines of gender, sexual orientation, religion, like, whatever. You have to be in these boxes within these lines and I feel that I don't, I feel that no one really fits into that lines. I mean, people could be really comfortable with their gender or really comfortable with themselves but no one entirely fits into those categories and some, like myself, completely don't fit into those categories and just fall into every sort of gray area possible. 

00:10:15
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. The various, uh, pop culture texts and fashion, music, etc. is where people live out their lives on a daily basis and it has particular significance for young people in terms of how they begin to see themselves from the world. Let's say in the case of, uh, TV, music, film, songs. In those texts, there's a lot of, uh, messages about gender, race, class, um, youth and those, those messages are not neutral. They, um, very much influence the way that people make meaning of their living experience. So in order to work with young people, it's important to engage in those, um, various texts because it's a primary influence, almost as or more important than family or other systems because of its, um, primary influence in this society. 

00:11:10
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Yeah. I think, I think that we would suggest, as others have, that popular culture is very much a dominating, a prevailing culture, um, and what you were just saying Dave that, as much, perhaps more than where we traditionally look as therapists, uh, what we would call, um, vertical culture where generationally young people learn from their families what their culture is. This is a horizontal kind of culture where, uh, culture is created going sideways, horizontally among peers and that is very much more dominant than it used to be in the past and particularly with young people. So the reason we think it's critical to engage, um, with everybody and in particular young people, uh, in therapy around this is it's a, it's a dominating, prevailing culture. It's one of the context people live in and I think as therapists, we often think about well, what are the contexts we need to consider, um, and this is a very important one to young people, uh, and it, often I think therapists will think of it as something to show interest in, to join with them but what we're gonna suggest as we get further into this conversation that it's not only important as a joining, um, tool. It's, it's important for the reasons Dave talked about, that it's critical. Popular culture provides some of the raw materials for identity construction and meaning making for, for young people. 

00:12:45
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. So we think it's, of course it's important to begin an alliance with a young person but we think that's just the, the starting point, not the end point. 

00:12:55
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) That's right. 

00:12:55
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Um, because in the messages of pop culture are tools, um, and material for, uh, talking about problems that young people struggle with and also, uh, a vehicle for solutions and new stories, new identities. Um, we think that pop culture, the mass media, reinforce particular norms of how people should be. 

00:13:20
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:13:20
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. They reinforce certain norms and exclude and marginalize others and with a lot of the young people we work with, including queer youth, those messages reinforce, um, a marginalization of those identities. Um, representations that are, um, deficit based pathologizing. So we think it's important to engage with young people about these conversations and we're always impressed, um, with how young people engage in these texts critically and it could lead to these really fruitful conversations in counseling. 

00:13:50
What are typical assumptions about youth consumption of Pop Culture? 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:13:55
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. You know, we're talking about, um, how people get stereotyped. People have ideas and I'm thinking, you know, Grace, I'm aware of some of your musical interests. Uh, we, we share, um, um, an appreciation for Minneapolis hip hop from the (inaudible ) and I'm thinking how is it you got into that and is there ever any of this kind of stereotype that's happened to you? You know, what's, what's this white girl doing listening and all up into this stuff? 

00:14:25
GRACE (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:14:25
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. You know, anybody go off on you in that way? 

00:14:30
GRACE Like, I don't know. I think that everyone at my school, like, expects me to be listening to pop music and stuff and, I don't know, people are, like, really surprised when I'm like oh yeah, I really like hip hop and stuff like that. And at my school, you're only cool if you're, like, a hipster. Like, if you, there's this one girl. Like, she's popular and stuff but, like, I hear so many people talking about her. They're like, oh man. She's so preppy. Like, she's, doesn't belong here 'cuz she's so preppy and stuff and, um, yeah. So I don't know. 

00:15:00
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. So when you talk about being a hipster or whatever, like what makes someone that? Is it what they listen to, what they wear? What kind of stuff? 

00:15:05
GRACE (crosstalk) Well, yeah. Like, I don't know. Hipster, I guess if you shop at, like, like, thrift stores and stuff or Urban Outfitters and then, like, you're really into photography and you listen to, like, Indie music and, like, anything mainstream. Like, I don't know. It's a stereotype so... 

00:15:25
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:25
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. I think that things that people, I suppose I should specify adults in general, therapists as adults in particular often assume about young people is that, um, while there can be this sort of binary idea that we engage around, either oh, kids will just be kids and it's kind of we can dismiss what they're participating in in popular media, or media culture, what they're consuming is just this thing that they're gonna do no matter what and it's insignificant or there's sort of a moral panic around it. Um, they're consuming all this stuff. Uh, they have no moral values. They're engaging in things that promote violence and misogyny and, and overconsumption, um, and so that's sort of this all or nothing binary rendering that is one way, um, we would suggest that, that young people's participation with and consumption of popular cultural, culture things, um, is construed. 

00:16:40
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:16:40
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Um, it's also often believed that young people are kind of mindless, uh, consumers of these who are unable to, uh, render a critique to make personal meaning of what they're doing with it, uh, to understand some of the things Dave was talking about, uh, when he was speaking to why we do this and the things that, that young people aren't able to see the racialized and gendered, um, for example messages in the items and things that they're consuming and participating in. So those are some of those typical assumptions that we want to invite people to begin examining themselves, uh, because we try to hold, hold that with softer hands and kind of approach it more as both end that absolutely there are problematic messages, as Dave said in, in media text. Uh, we certainly see problems with our, um, hyper-consumer culture that we live in, uh, and that's not just for young people. It's for adults too. And we also see, um, this as a productive clinical opportunity to work with young people to help bring forward the meanings they're making, to teach them literacy skills, media literacy skills and to find out for each young person what it means for them, uh, when they play a particular game or how they negotiate their relationships through texting and Facebook chats and, and things like that. You guys ever thought about who makes this stuff? Like, when you imagine, um, record producers and they're producing maybe mainstream rap, some of the stuff we talked about where they, you know, might get the idea that black men only get angry. Who do you imagine is in charge of that? 

00:18:40
TANGO It, yeah, I feel like corporations or, like, corporate sponsorships are, like, paying people to say certain things that they may not necessarily agree with or there just creating an image just for the sake of a selling point. 

00:19:00
GRACE I don't think that really anyone at my school understands, like, the power that corporations have and stuff and, like, I was trying to explain it to my friend the other day and we're talking about, like, Communism, capitalism, and socialism and she's like well I want to, I'm so glad that we live in a capitalist country because I just want to become rich like those rich people. I was like, you don't, like you don't understand it but, um, my social studies teacher Molly Keenan is doing a unit on multinational corporations so yeah. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) That's awesome. 

00:19:30
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Does it seem that you have to work hard though, to begin to think about these things about the power of corporations and who gets to solve, I mean, it took some work I'm assuming to do that as a teacher or... 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:19:45
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. It's not out there in the mainstream media 'cuz it's owned by corporations so... 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:19:50
Modeling 

00:19:50
SHEILA It's, it's stupid but, like, I feel like if you don't want to be in it, of course, don't do it 'cuz it's not a world that you should be in if you don't wanna be in it. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

00:20:00
SHEILA And then, like, of course they're gonna reject those people that are, that really wanna do it. They work so hard to do it. They're just gonna be like, you know, wanting is not enough. You don't have the look. 

00:20:10
TANGO That's what I feel so bad about. 

00:20:10
SHEILA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:20:10
TANGO It's like I have a body that looks like what they want and I don't want it at all and there are so many girls and so many people who are striving to be that thing and I have it and I don't even want it. 

00:20:25
SHEILA (crosstalk) And they can't have it. Exactly. It's crazy. It's all about the look. That's what's so hard about it. You have to have the look to make it. You have to have the look to do a certain type of thing. To be in a runway in New York, you have to be 5'9". 

00:20:35
TANGO Yeah. 

00:20:35
SHEILA I'm 5'4". 

00:20:35
TANGO I'm 5'9". 

00:20:35
SHEILA Yeah. So. 

00:20:40
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Yeah, so what's really interesting to me as I listen to you guys talk, you're both political. You're political intentionally by what you're doing and how you're thinking about what you're trying to bring to, um, challenge the system and say hey, there's, there's a, when I say story, I mean broadly. The, the story of who they're showing. And you're political by saying I'm not gonna participate in that. 

00:21:00
TANGO Yeah. 

00:21:00
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. You, you, you want this thing that I just lucked into or whatever. 

00:21:05
TANGO Yeah. 

00:21:10
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. And I'm not gonna participate in it. I'm gonna mess it up a little bit by wearing my pirates or something. 

00:21:10
TANGO Yes, that's totally what I do with it and I feel like this just goes into, like, I identify as gender queer and if you don't know what that means, it basically means that I don't, like that, that I identify with the masculine and feminine parts in me very equally. I think more so masculine, like, most of the time but, um, I definitely identify with both of the parts very strongly and I feel that, like with the model industry, you have to be female. You have to wear make up. You have to do this and I say no, screw you guys. I'm gonna put a sock in my pants and I'm gonna darken my face and I'm gonna put on a mustache and I'm gonna slick my hair back and I'm gonna wear a suit and a fedora and I'm gonna pass and I'm gonna look like a guy so screw all of you. And, and I just sort of, I change up. Like I'm gonna wear suit pants and I'm gonna wear my five inch heels and I'm gonna wear a suit and I'm gonna bind but I'm gonna wear a mustache. I'm gonna do eye liner. How about that? Take that. And so I, I, it's an adaptation that I've made. Like, my identifying as gender queer came first and then like seeing, like I guess an adaptation I've made is screwing with people. 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Right, right. 

00:22:30
TANGO And just playing with people like what gender is. 

00:22:35
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Therapists, you know, I, I see this when I'm consulting therapists, when I'm supervising people. It's almost like they feel like they don't have permission, uh, to talk with kids about stuff. It's like, oh, cool you've got that game on. Okay, now put it away. Uh, we gotta, we gotta do therapy now. That's not therapy and so it feels like they, they don't have permission. 

00:22:55
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. (crosstalk) Right. 

00:22:55
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. It's not a legitimate thing to do and so I think in the practice world, those are some assumptions too, that it's not the real work that we're there to do. 

00:23:05
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Sure. 

00:23:05
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. And so what we're gonna be talking about is providing, um, kind of theoretical framework, uh, for some conversational and theoretical resources that we're here to give you permission to engage in pop culture with young people. 

00:23:20
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Right. 

00:23:20
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. And, and some, some theoretical resources that legitimize that practice as sound and necessary clinical work. 

00:23:30
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. What I think contributes to, um, some of the more narrow or conservative, uh, interpretations of pop culture is, um, more empirical effect studies that, um, are conducted by empirical researchers that look at a particular, let's say a video game, a single text, and, um, unpack the meanings in that text and then theorize as to what effect that has on young people's behavior , um, mainly behavior. 

00:24:05
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:05
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. And yet in those very narrow effect studies, the young people themselves are not consulted. It's a very adultist, uh, version of research where we're not engaging with young people's creative meanings of pop culture and it also is very narrowly defined in terms of one text, a book, a song, a video game, as opposed to how all of these different culture industries are crisscrossing to each other to produce complex nuance ways of, uh, relating that are both productive and problematic. 

00:24:40
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. So it's selective in selecting narrowly a single text within a song or a film or a game and selective in just taking that one pop culture artifact... 

00:24:50
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Right. 

00:24:50
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. And selecting that as something to interpret and analyze without, again, consulting the person that's consuming and participating with it. 

00:25:00
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Right. And there is the assumption that in effects, effects research what are the negative effects? 

00:25:10
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:25:10
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. It is not necessarily talked about in terms of what are the productive effects that create possibilties. 

00:25:15
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Right. 

00:25:15
How can therapists engage with youth and Pop Culture in helpful ways? 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:20
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. As an alternative to some of the, um, effects research that we've discussed, we think there's a much more richer, more nuanced, uh, theoretical framework and a set of resources to make sense and analyze, uh, media, pop culture. Uh, there's a long history of cultural studies research that, um, argues first of all that, um, media text, pop culture text are not neutral. They don't just reflect reality. They actually shape reality. They constitute reality and they're constantly being evolved and rearticulated in interaction with the people who are consuming that text. So it looks at media from, uh, what might be called a triangulated, um, perspective or a three pronged approach. First of all, it looks at how, um, let's say in this case a, um, a Harry Potter book. Who's producing that book? What's the company that produces it? Who owns the storytelling rights? And then it looks at, um, a textual analysis. What are the meanings in, uh, Harry Potter? What are the messages around gender, race, class, consumerism? Um, so it requires some skill at, um, critical media literacy and deconstruction, textual analysis. It also requires, um, the counselor researcher and, and the citizens. This is, this is offered to the citizentry at large, the productive, uh, critical consumer to look at, um, a more traditional, um, approach that looks at the larger structures, capitalism and how those shape and help produce the stories that get told in our society and then the third part of that analysis, which is really important, is how does, um, a young person in this case, make meaning of that Harry Potter book. Um, and it's many meanings possible depending on the social location of that young person and their sexual identity, their class position and that those meanings can be not just, um, problematic, that, that, um, reinforce, like, subtle messages, uh, that reinforce problems or social inequities but it also can be a productive way of, um, constructing their identity where they have some sense of personal agency, um, that they can use those texts in ways, um, that give them a sense of purpose and meaning. 

00:28:00
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) Right. Yeah, so this third piece, so there was the production end, who's in charge of this stuff, who makes it and then the textual analysis piece about the meanings. This third one you're talking about is with audience meaning making is really where we, um, assume that there's, young people have agency. That they're not just consuming the messages intended by their producers but they can be in relationship with it and act on 'em and change them and it, and it becomes interactive. That they're shifting and acting on it as well. 

00:28:35
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Definitely. I think that last, uh, uh, the third aspect of cultural studies research is, um, skills that therapists have. 

00:28:45
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) That's right. 

00:28:45
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Of interviewing people and the meaning they make of various aspects to their lived experience so I think we have the tools that makes that, um, a real fit. It's also inviting therapists to have skills at deconstruction, textual analysis in interaction with our clients so it's a collaborative endeavor and also to look back at the larger picture or the macro perspective as to who's telling these stories and to take the position of social justice and that sort of stuff. 

00:29:15
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) You see, I'm not saying for what purpose. 

00:29:15
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Yes. Definitely. 

00:29:15
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. They're, you know, they're trying to make money. 

00:29:20
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:29:20
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. And they can sell a book or a film or a, but that nowadays begets t-shirts and posters and food products and all these things and so to help young people become critical consumers too, we can't escape consuming but we can start to make decisions about it. 

00:29:40
Textual poaching 

00:29:40
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. We talked about cultural studies, you know, three pronged analysis including, uh, the audience analysis, how consumers make meaning of text that may be, uh, what the producer or the text did not intend and one of the ways I think that's really useful is Henry Jenkins, uh, wrote a book on textual poaching, how, uh, particular consumers may make sense and insert themselves in a text, a text that they weren't originally represented in. So. 

00:30:10
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Well yeah, so it, it could be a story, a film, song lyric where someone, in this case, case we're talking about young people, actually insert themselves into the storyline as, uh, a character in that text, in that story and as a person in that story, they can change the meaning, the outcome of the story. 

00:30:35
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. It's really important for us as therapists to pay really close attention to how young people insert themselves into various, uh, stories, media text, and how they use that as a, um, a site of empowerment. 

00:30:55
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:55
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Uh, particularly if they're in a marginalized position: a young woman, a gay young man, etc., a trans youth that, even though they not, they might not be, uh, represented in that movie, let's say, they can imagine themselves in that movie. That gives them a sense of empowerment and that can be a really productive therapeutic conversation. That can help them to, to deal with certain problems they're struggling with. A person that I worked with that I think is a great example of how one can use, um, in this case a video game, to have some really, um, rich conversations around, in this case, gender or violence was, a young man that I was working with whom I'll call Victor and, um, I went on a field visit with one of my, uh, supervisees, I do some consulting work at La Familia and so we went to, um, one of her client's house. He was 16 and the main problem was he was engaging in a lot of defiance at home, at school. He was assaulting his mother, his younger sister, some drug use, was seen as oppositionally defiant. Uh, a young Mexican American man. His father was in prison for drug use and also had a long history of physically abusing his mom and also Victor himself. So my, my, uh, supervisee was really overwhelmed in this, uh, in working with Victor so brought me along for a consultation. So I went to the house 'cuz it was home based work and he was in his room play Grand Theft Auto and when we went to his room, his mom said Victor, turn off that game. You know, your therapist is here. You gotta do the real work and I said no, no. I'm interested in, um, in this game. Um, I have a son who's around the same age and I've heard all about this Grand Theft Auto stuff so I really wanna see what it's about. I don't wanna assume. I've heard all these stories about, um, the violence and the, uh, negative messages in the, uh, video game. So I'd like to, I'd like to sit down and just watch Victor play it and mom was looking at me like who is this guy? SO I sat down and the first thing that struck me of course was the hyper-violence, the hyper-masculinity. Um, there was some, uh, part of the video game where a woman, prostitutes were, um, were killed, were beaten, was shooting at police officers. So I had a suspend my, um, understandable concern of that, of those, um, images, not, not to trivialize them but to put them aside just for a bit to start where Victor was at and then I was impressed with just the skill at the game independent from the content, um, and here was somebody who also had been diagnosed attention deficit disorder and yet he had this incredible ability, like many young people, to concentrate to play this game. So I was really curious about the technique, the strategies, all the buttons and at first he was like don't you get it? You know, you're an adult. This is really easy, but as I really was genuinely curious about how he played this game, he shifted and he said this guy is cool. This guy really tries to understand where I'm at and as we started talking about the game, I asked him some questions about, um, you know, have you noticed that, um, uh, the gender of who's doing the shooting? You know, it tends to be man? And do you know who's being killed? Women. So why do you think that is? And I had in the back of my mind that his father was in prison and, you know, had been physically violent to his mom himself, like, um, what, what kind of attitudes do you think these men in, in the video game might have to justify their violence? Do you think your father was influenced by those same ideas? And he begrudgingly started thinking about it. Yeah, I mean this is a slow conversation as we were playing the video game. So it wasn't like I was sitting face to face. That will often, um, encourage a young person to close down. This was kind of opening up space 'cuz I was really, um, doing what Mike White called doubly listening. Listening to what he was doing and really being appreciative of that but also kind of opening up some space for some new ways of looking at this, this video game that related in some way to his life, to his father. Mom was in the background so she started hearing this and now she was engaged in this conversation that probably otherwise would not have happened if we weren't playing the video game and I said well, what do you, what do you think, um, where, where do you see yourself? Are these ideas, um, that justify this violence, do they suit you? And he said no. So then that led to a conversation on why that isn't who he is and the kind of man he prefers to be, the kind of person he wants to be in terms of, um, how he wants to treat women and it helped connect. His mom was surprised and wanted to hear more about that and that led to some new storylines. Um, from there then he was able to then share that, you know, um, I understand what you're saying David, or whatever he called me, um, probably called me something else but this game helps me to release some of my anger, my pent up anger at school. He went to a predominately, um, white school. He, he went to a parochial school and, um, he, um, felt somewhat marginalized. There was some racism. He wasn't in the insider crowd so it was one way of expressing his anger when he got home, his pent up anger. So he found that productive and then we had conversations as when you put the anger into the video game, how does that help you to be in the world outside of your game and then, you know, he obviously tries to, um, express his anger or control his anger. And then we look for times (inaudible ) that was already happening. Um, and then he, he talked about how in some ways, um, shooting the police officers was a way of him thinking about, um, standing up to racism 'cuz the cops represented dominant white culture and there's some theoretical resources, (inaudible ), who's a cultural studies queer scholar, talks about how marginalized, uh, persons, people of color, queers, can imagine themselves in a movie or, or a video game and it looks at first glance it's just reproducing the violence that's been done to them but she at first who is oppositional imagined violence, it creates some space for, um, agency for fighting oppression. So that really fit with Victor. Lastly talked about, well if he was in charge of producing a video game, what kind of video game would he make up about the story of his life and so it was very different from the Grand Theft Autos, so that conversation and the, the new stories that were developed that I then continued to work with him, I started seeing him then, from there 'cuz he wanted to see me again, um, it, it wouldn't have happened without that video. 

00:38:05
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) That's right. That's right. 

00:38:05
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Without starting with Grand Theft Auto as epitome of what's considered misogynistic text and yet it ended up being, in some ways, a discussion about gender justice. So that's a way of using it productively. 

00:38:20
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Whenever I hear you talk about that story, Dave, it, it brings to mind three little nuggets, little things that I try to hang onto around practice. One is that talking about something doesn't mean we're endorsing it. Just because we engage in a conversation about something or around something like a game like that doesn't mean we think it's all okay. It's not an all or nothing. But we're curious and we're interested which leads to my second little nugget is show interest, not alarm 'cuz if we come from that place of alarm or censorship or don't do this, uh, place where mom started, and I get why she would do that. She doesn't want to see, you to think that her son's out of control or she doesn't, you know, whatever. I can imagine. 

00:39:05
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. (crosstalk) Right. 

00:39:05
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. But to show interest, not alarm. And finally that, I think therapists all the time say meet them where they're at but I really invite people to say are you ready to meet them where they're at? 'Cuz lots of time where people are at, literally and/or figuratively, are places that we may not be comfortable or ready to go but that's where we have to be. And I think that story reminds me of those three pieces that are kinda clinical compass points for me, um, all the time. 

00:39:40
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. (crosstalk) Yeah. I think, um, along, right along with that is, um, if I would have turned off the video game, I wouldn't have been starting where he was at. 

00:39:50
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. That's right. 

00:39:50
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. I would have done what his mom understandably assumed what I should be doing because of the dominant ideas of therapy and my supervisee's, shut that off. Let's have this face to face conversation. 

00:40:00
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) That's right, right. 

00:40:00
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Which, again, privileges a certain way of doing counseling or doing therapy that's about talking face to face that may actually be a rather thin deficit based conversation that is less rich in nuance, significantly so, then the conversation that was brought forth through a cultural studies discussion of this video game. 

00:40:25
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:40:25
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Now Victor wouldn't, wouldn't say that he was a cultural studies scholar, but I think one of the things that really, um, we like about cultural studies is it's a, it's about using ideas not just in the academy. 

00:40:35
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. (crosstalk) That's right. 

00:40:35
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. But as to become public citizens, critical consumers. Um, citizens that are, um, have media literacy skills to not be so subtly manipulated by the media and also to use them productively to become an active engagement in their own cultural forms of expression. So in this one session, we had a discussion of political economy, we analyzed the text and privileges, his meanings and when we do that in the work we find that incredible outcomes occur. 

00:41:00
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Right. Well, I think about what's the conversation he's inviting you to have. 

00:41:05
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Right. 

00:41:05
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. And that's the one you had with him in the sense that this is important to him. This is his world and you didn't turn it off. 

00:41:15
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Right. 

00:41:15
Therapists taking up a culturally informed practice... 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:20
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. You know, one way to, to fight back is to be aware of the top corporations through education. I'm wondering if another way that you might do it is to create your own forms of media creativity that comes bottom up from you rather than the companies feeding it to you. Like making your own film or your own music, things like that. Does that make sense? Does that, is anybody doing that? I know you, you know, you're doing some of your own hip hop. 

00:41:50
NICK Yeah, I have, uh, I have currently just one CD out that I do with my job and I've worked with other kids. 

00:41:55
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. Uh-huh. 

00:41:55
NICK So me, my friend, his name is Comma. Um, he's a really good artist. He makes his own beats and then raps to him but then we just made a little mixed tape, just something for the, the kids that I work with. 

00:42:10
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. So you get to tell your own stories rather than corporations telling you what stories are important. 

00:42:20
NICK (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:42:20
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. What kinds of images would you want to produce? What messages would you want what you're producing to convey to people and particularly young people such as yourselves? 

00:42:30
NICK Um... 

00:42:35
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. How would you change the story? 

00:42:35
NICK You know what? All, all I do is really make music rhyme while having a good time. 

00:42:40
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Mm-hmm. A good time. 

00:42:40
NICK Either a good time or a life story. 

00:42:45
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Life story. 

00:42:45
SHEILA I'd make a fashion magazine to more of a broad spectrum of what everyone looks like, not just that stereotypical. It would be, it would have every type of person in it so that when whoever's looking at the magazine doesn't have to feel bad for them, about themselves. Just like you said. You want to find someone that looks like you and if you look into a magazine and you feel like no one looks like you and then pretty soon you're insecure and you're trying to make yourself into that because I wanna conform to something. I wanna belong to something and if I don't see it in the magazine, of myself of what I am right now, I'll make myself into that that I see. 

00:43:30
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. You'd make a magazine that many, many people could open up and flip to a page and find something like themselves. Okay. 

00:43:35
SHEILA (crosstalk) Yeah. So they don't have to change themselves. 

00:43:40
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. Great. So Tango, what would you do if you had a company to be in charge of? What would you want to produce? 

00:43:45
GRACE You know, instead of making it about one stereotype and whatever and, like, one thing, I don't know, something that can relate to everyone, I guess. 

00:43:55
TANGO Yeah, I'd like to get everybody involved too. And not just, like, you know, everybody, like, with different gender identities or sexual identity or sexual identities and just try to get people to try new things like you were saying. Like, be dangerous. Be adventurous. Be on the edge. Like, try something new for once. Experiment. Like, experimentation. Like, if you discover something about yourself, that's not who you're gonna be for the rest of your life. It may be how you're gonna be for, like, five years, three months but you're just gonna go on from there and just gonna keep expanding. So I think experimentation is something that's really kind of frowned upon. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:35
TANGO In our American culture. 

00:44:40
JULIE TILSEND, PH.D. The last piece we'd want to leave you with is to invite you to be reflexive about your own participation with consumption of, relationship with popular culture, media culture, the culture industries. Do that by starting, going back in time as a little kid. What did you enjoy? What cartoons did you watch? What games did you play? What were the adult responses to that? It, it, what responses were helpful? If there weren't helpful adult responses, what do you wish adults would have done or wouldn't have done? Think about as a teenager what music did your parents really endorse you listening to and which ones could cause you to butt heads? And questions like that but to keep going not only just thinking about when you were a little kid and a teenager but right now. I started our conversation today by saying you know, what might the labels be on your clothes. What does that mean for you? Um, have you thought about where some of these comes, these things come from? What would it mean to not have these? And so for us to be reflexive about how we participate in consumer culture, what in pop culture provides us with some raw materials that are important for us? How have we acted back, spoken back or resisted some of those messages by inserting ourselves in the text or, or analyzing the meaning? For us to do the same thing we're asking you to consider doing with your clients would be the last thing that we'd wanna, uh, invite you to consider in the ideas we're talking about. 

00:46:25
DAVID NYLUND PH.D. It reminds me of a recent conversation I had with, um, a father, um, who was, was involved in his son's therapy and was concerned about, um, how much, um, his, his transgender, uh, male youth son, um, although he, he was supporting transition, um, he was concerned as to how much time he spent Facebooking, texting, video games, computers, understandably so. I mean, for a number of reasons that we explored in counseling but I remember in the beginning part of the conversation, as a way of connecting with the father, um, he's from Wisconsin and I'm from, you know, Michigan. So we had a conversation about the big 10 championship game between Michigan State and Wisconsin and it was helpful to develop alliance with dad and create some connection for this tough conversation we had around gender and then some of these issues around how his son, uh, spends his time is I was able to go back, like I hear you're concerned about these things and yet you watch football and is that also a pop culture and how much time do you spend on that on Sundays? And what are the messages and football? And he, no, that's different. That's, that's, you know, real. So in a sense, we're, we're saying, as Julie said, to really reflect upon how we spent our time and that's just, many times, often because of our, um, corporate consumer capitalist society, um, we're engaged on a daily basis and influenced by the culture industries ourselves that shaped the way we see ourselves, that shape the way we see young people, the, the politics, a whole series of things. So if there really is not much difference, in my opinion, in terms of the concerns we have for youth culture and adult culture. In fact both of us would say often young people have a lot more critical things to say about media, that they might have, uh, more critical media literacy skills than a lot of the adults and friends that we know, so...
