RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. And it's my pleasure to welcome you to this Webcast series: Neuroscience In Action. How the brain matters. So as we have discovered over the last 10 or 15 years in this field uh, there are better ways of understanding the brain than just to put it in a black box and assume that it's irrelevant to the task of psychotherapy. So we've learned a great deal about the nature of the brain, the different components of the brain, brain function. It's now durregur(ph) that we have to refer it to the amygdale in just about any presentation given at a large psychotherapy conference. Uh, the, the question at this point is how are these concepts, how is our understanding of brain function actually be integrated in the way that clinicians operate in their offices everyday. So, that's our focus for this entire series and to get us started on that exploration we have uh, we're very fortunate to have uh, the person who as much as anyone in our field. Has really given us understanding of how the brain operates and the connection between brain function and things as we as psychotherapist do. Uh, uh, and it's my great pleasure here to introduce uh, Dan Siegel, who is. 

00:01:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Hi, Rich. 

00:01:45
RICH SIMON Written about this subject and really been a pioneer and a trade trail blazer. So, Dan what we're gonna be doing today, it's a little bit different from these other conversations you and I have had over, over the last few years in this Webcast series, is really focus very, in a very nuts and bolts way, a concrete way on you as a practicing clinician how you bring your credigeous knowledge of brain science and interpersonal neurobiology into your work with clients. So I thought a good way to do this is to talk about it in um, three stages to really begin with the first stage of assessment. From the get go. Someone's coming into you office for the first time. So, not only as a psychotherapist, but someone whose so steeped in understanding of brain function, what is it that you're doing in that first session to really assess in addition to all the other things that uh, therapist may assess? Uh, the way they're, the nature of brain function for that client and how that's gonna be brought to bear in the course of the therapeutic relationship. 

00:02:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Well thanks, Rich. And I think it's wonderful you're having this uh, subject covered. You know, it's extremely important um, question how therapist can use not only neuroscience but all the branches of science as a foundation for their work. Um, and so it's, I think it's great that you're doing this. So, thank you. Uh, you know, in the assessment phase what's really crucial uh, is to realize that a psychotherapist, someone who is a therapist in the field of mental health is actually assessing the mind. Uh, and the mind is not the same as the brain. Uh, so as we're gonna look at neural science it would be really I think a serious mistake to think that a psychotherapist is a brain therapist. 

00:03:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:03:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Um, because we're not neurologist. Neurologist are wonderful people doing important work. But we are people in the field of psychotherapy, of mental health not brain health. So, in the assessment phase uh, this first part you, you're asking that we talk about it's real important that a therapist realize that as a member of the field of mental health we have these two words; mental and health. And so from the perspective of I and my colleagues work from you called interpersonal neurobiology we see the mind as this process that's both embodied. So, it's more than just what's up in the head in the brain but it's the whole body. Uh, and we also see it as not just embodied but as also relation. So, you know the experience that we have in the assessment phase is going to be fundamentally exploring the mind because as a mental health practitioner you will be actually looking at the relational experience that emerges and trying to tease apart different aspects of the embodied experience. All within the framework of the subjective life of the client, of the patient. 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:05:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Which means their inner felt sense. It means their kind of thinking they have. It means their mood, it means their attitude, their hopes, their dreams, their longings, their intentions. All of that subjective inner mental stuff is the essence of what we look for. It's not what a neurologist looks for, it's what we look for. 

00:05:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:05:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Cuz we're mental professionals, not brain professionals. 

00:05:25
RICH SIMON Right. You're not thinking of the brain dysfunction. You're not looking. 

00:05:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Well, you're not only looking for brain dysfunction, that's right. You're gonna look for that too. Uh, but we're looking at a much larger um, canvas, if you will. 

00:05:40
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:05:40
DANIEL SIEGEL We're looking at the subjective nature of felt life uh, which amazingly is the core of the mind that many fields of academic uh, pursuit have led go because you can't quantify it. You can't measure it. You can't make it objectively absolute. It is my it's nature subjective. But that's the stuff of what we do. 

00:06:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:06:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah, so that's the first thing is to realize it's subjective inner experience, it's intersubjective experience between people. It's the ability of a person to tune into the subjective experience of another person. All that we'll talk about but at the start subjective experience, consciousness, and then this embodied relational organizing process is what we're gonna look at. And I'll talk about how to do that. 

00:06:30
RICH SIMON Maybe there some way to get at it. So there's uh, uh, an enormous overlap. You're trained as a psychotherapist. You've had a lot of different kinds of training. So, what is in addition to what a, all that we've been talking about up to this point are the kinds of things many psychotherapist would agree with you. That this is the part of what they're attempting to assess, they're developing a relationship with their client, they're getting people a sense of what they're trying to accomplish. There's all the initial test in the first session of psychotherapy. As someone whose infor-, whose approach is informed by interpersonal neurology, the field you have created, uh, with your collaborators. What, what would be distinctive here in addition to um, this kind of uh, an agenda that you would share with many other psychotherapist in a concrete way? What are some of the things that you might ask about or pay attention to? 

00:07:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Sure. 

00:07:25
RICH SIMON Because of your, this particular angle vision that you've developed? 

00:07:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Right, so this vision uh, of interpersonal neurology which, you know, draws on all of the different disciplines of science to combine into one. So, it's not the same as social neuroscience which is a branch of neuroscience. Which is a branch of biology. Interpersonal neurology actually combines all the disciplines of science into one. And one of the things that we do is, first of all we're not a form of therapy. We are actually more of a way of knowing so we inform therapy rather than a form of therapy, so. 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON You're not a method of psychotherapy. 

00:08:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Not at all. I mean there maybe strategies uh, that come from this approach as I'll describe now. 

00:08:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:10
DANIEL SIEGEL But we're not, we're not presenting ourselves and we're not trying to be uh, uh, some kind of form of therapy that we pitted against another form. In fact all the different forms, the major forms of therapy that has asked us to come represent an interpersonal neurology view of their way of doing cognitive therapy, family therapy, group therapy, whatever form. Uh, and it's been very rewarding to see IPNB, interpersonal neurobiology can shed new light on what these wonderful forms of therapy are doing. So, one thing we offer that isn't existing anywhere. Which is kind of a shocking reality. But as we offer the definition of the mind. And for a field of mental health which actually lacks a definition of mind this for us is a very grounding place because we're not only a part of mental health but we're a part of the field of education and parenting, and contemplative practice. And we do lots of different ways of um, making uh, supportive presentations to all these different efforts. But for a field of mental health to have no definition of the mind, which after asking a 100 thousand mental health professionals. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:09:25
DANIEL SIEGEL In every discipline of science it's kind of a shocking reality that only 2 to 5% say, "Oh, I was given the definition of mind." So here's the assessment phase, here's why that's important. We define the mind beyond consciousness and nonconsciousness, beyond subjective experience. We define it as a self organizing, which means an emergent property of a complex system; it's self organizing. Embodied relational proccess, so it's both in the body. Not just in the head. And its also in relationships, so it's both. And that it's regulating something. It's regulating energy and information flow. And that's unique. So, we say what's different about IPNB? Nowhere else will you find a definition of the mind. And certainly, since there is no definition you won't find this definition because there's no definition. So, in doing that then we can then take the next step. And say, well if that's a working definition of one part of the mind beyond subjective experience, beyond consciousness what's a healthy mind? And how would assessment try to feel the texture of a healthy mind or an unhealthy mind? 

00:10:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:10:30
DANIEL SIEGEL And we make a statement about that. We through long lines of reasoning, and you can read about this in The Developing Mind or other textbooks, Interpersonal Neurobiological Series from Norton. We say that health comes from integration. And you and I have had conversations about this at length before. 

00:10:45
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:10:45
DANIEL SIEGEL But integration is the linkage between different parts and the energy and information flow in your body or the energy and information flow between you and me right now in our relationship are the same essence. So, this is the part that throws a lot of people in academics or even in, in, uh, other fields that aren't used to thinking this way. Energy and information flow, energy is the capacity to do stuff. It has different forms; kinetic energy, electrical energy, photo, you know, photon energy. Um, all sorts of forms of energy. The brain, the nervous system is getting electrical chemical energy flow. But all aspects of relationship ride along patterns of energy flow. Now sometimes those patterns whether they're in the brain or in our relationship have symbolic value beyond just their pattern. And so an energy flow that has symbolic value we call it information. So that's what that means. And the word flow just means change across time. So when that flow is integrated it's harmonious. And you can get a feeling for that in an assessment when a person talks flexibly. When they seem adaptive to what's changing their environment. So, the stresses they encounter, the what's called the alostatic(ph) load. The changes in all these ways of homeostasis being uh, challenged. You know, my work, job change, uh, my kids went off to school, um, my husband's an alcoholic and he's getting in recovery now. And these are all stressors on me. The way you deal with stressors can, can be done with flexibly. So you adapt. You can stay what's called coherent. Meaning you have a clear view of what's going on. You see the positive, the negatives, and you incorporate your ongoing life story in a open fluid way that's coherent. And you're energized, you have vitality for life or you're excited to be alive. You're appreciative. Uh, and then you have a kind of dynamic stability. Uh, where things change as you move along. But generally, you know, you have a sense of not following off the cliff, you know. So that spells organization. 

00:12:55
RICH SIMON Let me just stop you for a second. 

00:12:55
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:12:55
RICH SIMON As you're describing this. So these concepts inform what you do. If, if, if the people who are listening to this, if they're trying to envision how then this informs what your, what they might do with a client, the kinds of questions you're asking. This if we move it down at the more ground level of uh, of how one gets, assesses this quality of differentiation and integration, this various ways in which you have described um, uh, the healthy functioning of mind. What is it, what, how do you get at this information? What is the kind of things that you, you ask for? What's going on in the first half hour, let's say of uh, of uh, interview? Uh, to begin with, how long is an inter-, your initial interview with uh, with a? 

00:13:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Well I try to have the initial interview, if possible be 90 minutes. 

00:13:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:13:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Rather than 45, for sure. 

00:13:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:13:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Uh, you know, um, and it, you know, in the evolution of Psychotherapy Networker, you know, Jeff Zieg had be do two 60 minute interviews with volunteers in front of 3,000. 

00:14:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:14:05
DANIEL SIEGEL People. 

00:14:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:14:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Wasn't exactly a normal clinical situation but. 

00:14:05
RICH SIMON All right, okay. 

00:14:10
DANIEL SIEGEL You can see that. In our three year program, you know, I do, I do eight hours of demonstrating of how to do the evaluation phase. And I role-play different clients and how they would respond to different questions. So you know, this is you, what you and I are doing is a very condensed version. 

00:14:25
RICH SIMON Very condensed, yeah. 

00:14:25
DANIEL SIEGEL (crosstalk) approach. 

00:14:30
RICH SIMON We're, we're getting the points here, yeah. 

00:14:30
DANIEL SIEGEL So, so but, but here's what you're uh, um, here's what you're looking for ultimately. 

00:14:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:14:35
DANIEL SIEGEL Is when a system is not integrated it's chaotic or rigid. And in fact, the entire DSM can be reinterpreted from interpersonal neurobiology view as all examples of chaos, rigidity or both, that is all the symptoms of all the syndromes, that entire book can be seen as chaos or rigidity, or some combination. 

00:15:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:15:00
DANIEL SIEGEL And when you see that then instead of having the DSM be either your pri-, prison warden. Which some people feel it is. 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, right. 

00:15:10
DANIEL SIEGEL Some people feel it's, you know, uh, something they wanna fight against. You know, just pushing it. We actually see it as an important document that when its interpreted as clusters of symptoms that show cast a rigidity, we say that all the major forms of psychiatric disorders that are listed in there are examples of impaired integration. Like, let's say, let's start with bipolar disorder. 

00:15:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:15:40
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, Hillary Bloomberg at Yale showed that the integrated fibers from the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex to your friend the amygdale are too few in number. And so the ability of this higher upstairs prefrontal region to modulate the lower region at times especially, you know, if things are not in balance that lack of integration leads to either mania or depression. Mania being an example of chaos. Depression being an example of rigidity. And you know you can, you can assess for that, right. It's perfectly possible. 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON So, so as you're, so, if it's, give us an example. Someone is, if you can think of uh, a case you saw recently or something about, someone is coming in and you're, so you're, you're goal one of the first things that's important for you are these dimensions of chaos and rigidity. 

00:16:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON As kind of a guiding principle. And whatever the diagnostic. 

00:16:35
DANIEL SIEGEL And you're gonna look for that, right. 

00:16:35
RICH SIMON So, uh, it, it's, so what would be uh, uh, to, just give us an idea of you in action and how you begin to get at uh, uh, uh, doing that assessment. And then we'll move on to the next step of then how you. 

00:16:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Sure. 

00:16:50
RICH SIMON Develop your treatment plan and, and start. 

00:16:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Absolutely. Sure. 

00:16:55
RICH SIMON And operate. 

00:16:55
DANIEL SIEGEL Well let me, I'll give you an example of uh, you know, uh, uh, a real person. 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:17:00
DANIEL SIEGEL That I saw uh, recently for a follow-up but I'll give you the, the assessment. 

00:17:05
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:17:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Um, you know, he came to me. And uh, the first thing I want to ask is, and this is just a general point. 

00:17:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:10
DANIEL SIEGEL Is, you know, like any therapist would say, "What brings you here?" 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:17:15
DANIEL SIEGEL You know. 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:17:15
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, if they say, you know, the bus. 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:17:20
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, something about what they're, uh, they're interpreting as the meaning of that question. 

00:17:20
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:17:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Uh, and, and, you know, tell me what, what you're here for, you know. And so, if a person says, you know, "Nothing. I'm not here for anything." This guys says nothing. 

00:17:30
RICH SIMON MM-hmm. 

00:17:30
DANIEL SIEGEL And then he says the word, nothing, you know. So I say, "Well, Okay.", you know. "What, what should we talk?" He goes, "Well, my son thinks I should be here.", right. 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:17:40
DANIEL SIEGEL And, uh, so I said, "What do you think?" He goes, "I don't think I need to be here." I said, "Okay." So in this case his son was in the waiting room; we brought his son in. 

00:17:50
RICH SIMON Cool. 

00:17:50
DANIEL SIEGEL This guy was 92 at the time; is the I talk about in the, the Mind Sight, book. You know, and Stewart, we'll call him Stewart. 

00:17:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:00
DANIEL SIEGEL He comes in and, you know, his son says, "I'm worried about my dad. I think he's depressed because all he does is sit around the house. He doesn't interact with his grandchildren, doesn't interact with his children much anymore. He just sits around and I think he's depressed." Frame-, so that's pretty straight forward, right. So, now the son leaves and I say, "Well, tell me Stewart do you, do you feel down in the dumps?" He goes, "No." Do you feel uh, do you have trouble sleeping? "No." Do you, have you lost appetite? "No." So I'm looking at the, the biological signs of a shut down system. 

00:18:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, right. 

00:18:30
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, because the mind in embodied. It isn't just your thinking or it's not your relationships, it's also embodied, right. So, he doesn't have any of the embodied signs of a shutdown rigid process. 

00:18:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:45
DANIEL SIEGEL So I said, "Well, how about your relationships? Tell me about those." And he goes, "Well, they're fine. I don't really like hanging around with people. And you know, my wife is out of the hospital. So, that's fine. And I just like reading books, you know. I'm retired from being an attorney and I just, you know, read my books." 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Now, I said, "Well is there anything bothering you?" "No." 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:05
DANIEL SIEGEL "Nothings bothering me." 

00:19:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:19:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Now at that moment, of course, you could say, nothings bothering him. Let the man go, right. 

00:19:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:10
DANIEL SIEGEL And uh, and that would be fair enough, you know. You'd say, well the subjective experience of Stewart is nothings bothering him. Why do you impose your, you know, as my kids would say, why are you imposing your view of health on to other people. 

00:19:25
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:19:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Just let the man live. 

00:19:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:25
DANIEL SIEGEL You know. So, I said, "Okay. well, you know, if nothings bothering you, I don't know what we're, there is to talk about. Let me ask you a little bit." So, in this case since I knew I would only have one 90 minute visit with him. 

00:19:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:35
DANIEL SIEGEL I wanted to get a feeling for his range of mental functions and how fluid they were or how rigid or chaotic they were. One of those functions for example, is autobiographical memory, right. I wanted to see how he was as a 92-year old. He didn't have any signs of depression. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Despite what his son said. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Um, although other people might have thought he was withdrawn cuz he just wasn't that engaging. It, he apparently been like that, his son said his whole life. Nothing had changed. 

00:20:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:10
DANIEL SIEGEL This is the way his dad was when, I mean Stewart's 92, you know, this is the way his dad was when he was a young man. Um, as far as his son could remember. So, anyway, so now I'm testing his autobiographical memory. I want to see what the mind of Stewart is like. 

00:20:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Right. And since we define the mind as this embodied relational process that regulates energy and information flow. As a therapist at this moment what I'm doing is I'm feeling like a person takes a pulse. I'm taking the pulse of energy and information flow. And that's a really useful way. 

00:20:50
RICH SIMON And, and the question is, how, and how, so what are the questions in a concrete way, how is that you do that? 

00:20:55
DANIEL SIEGEL So, I say to him, "Well, tell me a little bit about your life." I could say, "Tell me about what you had for, for breakfast." It doesn't. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:21:00
DANIEL SIEGEL The issue isn't. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON Tell me a story, okay. 

00:21:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Uh, yeah, tell me a story, right. 

00:21:05
RICH SIMON Nice. 

00:21:05
DANIEL SIEGEL So it's a rela-, narratives are relational process. 

00:21:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:10
DANIEL SIEGEL And, and the energy and information flow that starts emerging from Stewart is very thin. Oh, tell me about your life. "Oh, what do you mean, I'm an attorney, retired, and I'm here. 

00:21:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:20
DANIEL SIEGEL So there's not much, I don't feel much engagement inside of me in terms of this process of evaluation. I need to be taking the pulse of energy information flow in me. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON So you're part of this assessment? You're, uh. 

00:21:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Completely. 

00:21:35
RICH SIMON Responses are very much, uh, very important in the way you approach your work? 

00:21:35
DANIEL SIEGEL That's right, not only in the beautiful, you know, counter transfer issues that psychodynamic therapy. 

00:21:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:40
DANIEL SIEGEL Tells us to be aware of which are very important. But also by defining the mind as relational I'm in that relationship now in this moment with Stewart. 

00:21:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Right. This is why a questionnaire won't cut it. 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:21:55
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, you've got to have a human being who is trained in the science of relationships as well as the science of the brain and the body as a whole. 

00:22:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:22:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Okay. So, so now I'm getting a sense of the thinness of it, right. So he says, "Well, that's it." I said, "Well tell me about, you know, tell me about what goes on at home." "Well, my wife was in the hospital, now she's out, and everything's fine." I said, "Well how'd you feel when she went in the hospital?" 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:20
DANIEL SIEGEL He goes fine. What do you mean? And the feeling in me when he says is it, is there's rigidity. 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:25
DANIEL SIEGEL In our relationality in that communication of energy coming from Stewart to me, me to him. 

00:22:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:22:30
DANIEL SIEGEL So I start feeling, and the beautiful thing about this approach is it's simple. You don't have to remember that much. 

00:22:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:22:35
DANIEL SIEGEL Rigidity or chaos. So, so in that moment I can be fully present. All I'm doing is keeping my mind rigidity or chaos. So, now I'm feeling this rigidity. I go, uh, red flag. This doesn't feel good. 

00:22:50
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:22:50
DANIEL SIEGEL And, and I'm not gonna like name names. Oh, rigid man, you know. No. I'm just saying, this relationality feels rigid. So I say, "Well what does it feel?" "He's, she's back and that's fine." I said, "Well, what was it like when she was in the hospital or what happened?" 

00:23:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:00
DANIEL SIEGEL She's well, she had pneumonia but she's better. 

00:23:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:05
DANIEL SIEGEL I said, "What was it like before she got better?" And the look on his face, in me feels full of terror. 

00:23:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:15
DANIEL SIEGEL And what I kind of expected as a coherent response was I was terrified or it was really scary. He goes, "It was nothing." 

00:23:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:25
DANIEL SIEGEL So now there's a kind of chaotic feeling I get of the terror I could see in his face, the words that came out or it was nothing, and the incongruent, incoherence between the nonverbal signals being sent and the verbal signals being sent gave me a chaotic feeling inside. So, now I flipped from a shutdown rigidity to a feeling of chaotic incoherence. 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:50
DANIEL SIEGEL An so that's another red flag that's popping up in my mind. Stewart in this first three minutes of being alone with him after his son left the room. 

00:24:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Is feeling chaotic and rigid. So I want to explore more. So I say to him, you know, "Uh, let's talk more, you know. What's your relationship with your wife been like?" He gives me a very quick overview, not much detail. Um, and I said, "Would you mind if I ask you a couple of questions about your childhood, you know?" And um, and in this in this moment and this may have, I, I may be conglomerate because it's been a long time with Stewart, but. 

00:24:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:30
RICH SIMON This may have been in the second session. I don't remember exactly. But this can easily be in the first session. Just a brief, brief um, interlude of exploring his long term memory. Because he doesn't seem to be having memory problems. I, you know, just do general things about what's going on in the world. And he remembers. 

00:24:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
DANIEL SIEGEL He's very oriented. There's no signs of dementia. 

00:24:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:55
DANIEL SIEGEL He doesn't complain of any memory problems. His son doesn't complain about them. So now, or a little bit of it has passed. And he says, "I don't remember my childhood. Why would I'm 92." Well, the fact is we, you know, we do have an autobiographical narrative which includes major themes about our childhood that happens way into our senescence. We always have, in fact we hold on that longer than anything else. But he doesn't. So, knowing that, knowing about how the mind develops and knowing about autobiographical memory narrative I understand that this is not a sign of dementia. This actually, or depression, this more feels like a sign of uh, dismissing adult attachment stance. And I want to get the full adult attach interview which ultimately I get with him. 

00:25:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:25:35
DANIEL SIEGEL But that's a narrative that's marked by rigidity. Unlike a preoccupied one that's marked by chaos. So, I'm starting to getting a feeling that there may be something in now the first 17, 20 minutes of this 90 minute experience that's giving me a feeling inside of myself of chaos and rigidity. 

00:25:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:25:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Which means there's integration that's impaired. 

00:25:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:25:55
DANIEL SIEGEL I understand from the framework I work in that everyone comes from a childhood and everyone comes out with some form of mental model of attachment. For 65% of the nonclinical population it is secure. So if there were signs of impaired integration it isn't from, you know, attachment histories. In Stewart's case I'm getting a feeling he may be in the 20, 25% of the nonclinical population that would be counted as having an avoidant attachment history with a dismissing attachment narrative. Which means uh, in a sense if you want to just say it easily. Uh, kids have to develop a, a premature sense of autonomy and depending on others is not their forte. And yet interpersonal relationships depend on interdependence. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:26:45
DANIEL SIEGEL So if his wife of 65 years got ill and potentially was dying that would challenge every adaptation he made since he was a kid. And now we're only half an hour into the evaluation. I haven't said this to him and I haven't. 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Made a proclamation of saying, you're dismissing attachment or anything. I'm just wondering about it. 

00:27:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:05
DANIEL SIEGEL So, I have a four dimensional assessment I'm doing of how an adaptation possibly during early child, of the first few years of childhood. 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Maintained in an adolescences we haven't explored yet um, emerging as an adaptation that kept him surviving with a certain approach would allow him to frame his relationships, the fundamental nature of his mind a certain way for these 92 years. That then now as his wife is getting ill for the first time ever would present him with a life stressor of I can't deal with this because, of course I need my wife but I can't need her because I have a history of avoidance attachment. So I can't need anybody. And this would be something I would tip him over the ability to adapt. Because he's never had an experience like this which basically he's withdrawing from other people, reading all the time, doesn't engage with his family, you know, his grandkids, his kids. Um, doesn't even go into his work anymore. He goes back if, after he retired he goes back all the time. Won't see his friends. And then he says this to me. 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:10
DANIEL SIEGEL "You know, I don't think this makes any sense to talk about my childhood but there is one thing that doesn't make much sense to me." I said, "What's that?" He goes, "You know, this guy I work with, who I've worked with for about 45 years in the law firm is sick and dying and I feel nothing." 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:28:30
DANIEL SIEGEL And he goes, "That's not right. There's something not right with me if I feel nothing." I said, "Well, how do you feel?" He goes, "Nothing." He goes, "In fact, when anyone ever asks me that question, how do you feel? I don't know what they're talking about. I don't understand. All my life I don't know what they mean with that." And now we're like 60, 65 minutes into the interview and I'm getting this feeling of having sat with him for an hour that there's a lot of rigidity in the interpersonal way his mind is able to be present with me. Very tight, not much nonverbal signal demonstration, uh, not much access to autobiographical memory. Um, he doesn't seem very in tuned with his body. And now he's proclaiming that it's wrong. And it's interesting this right, wrong proclamation. 

00:29:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:20
DANIEL SIEGEL About not being aware of feeling state. He doesn't have access to his body. So, I know because I know about the brain as a mental health practitioner, that the signals from the muscles and bones, the signals from the heart, with its intrinsic nervous system around, the cardiac muscle. Um, the system around the intestines, our gut feelings all rise up either through the first layer of the spinal cord, laminal one, or the 10th cranial nerve. And they ultimately arise and allows the interception in certain areas in the brain that are primarily on the right hemisphere. So, I get a feeling as I'm putting all this together minute number 70 that what's rigid about Stewart and what makes him prone to chaos is he's impaired in hid integration to cross the hemispheres. And I know it's politically. 

00:30:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:30:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Incorrect in a neuroscience world to talk about this. But, you know, if you look at Ian MacGilacrest book, The Master's Emissary, and deeply go into this. 

00:30:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:30:20
DANIEL SIEGEL You realize that for millions and millions of years we've had, we've had asymmetry across the hemispheres. And when we have understanding the impairment integration and attachment is this inability of the left and right to work together. So, because the right is involved in stress reduction, because the right is involved in autobiographical memory dominantly, because the right sends and understands nonverbal signals, because the right has an integrated map of the whole body all of that right sided stuff I feel is underdeveloped in Stewart. 

00:30:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:30:50
DANIEL SIEGEL And, and I get a, and I, so now at, at minute number 70 I've got my formulation of where there's chaos and rigidity. 

00:31:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:31:00
DANIEL SIEGEL I've got now the, the eight domains of integration I'm gonna want to explore. Which is integration of consciousness, of bilateral integration. Which we're gonna explore now. Vertical integration, and memory integration which he has impaired. Because he has no access to autobiographical memory of the most part. Um, narrative integration which he has impaired and state integration, and temporal integration, interpersonal integration which he certainly has impaired. There's no sense of joining. 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:31:25
DANIEL SIEGEL And so now, what I'm gonna do is see the chaos or rigidity I'm tapping into in the assessment how might it fit in to those eight domains of integration. And since I'm trained in interpersonal neurobiology as a student of this field then I know how to do that. So I can tell you, for example, integrational consciousness would be where a person can't differentiate the knowing from the known. They have a feeling or a thought, or a memory and it just floods them and that's all there is. And you can do an intervention that's we'll talk about next. You know, how do you actually promote the integration of consciousness for Stewart. The highlighted feature just in this moment in the evaluation because they're often overlapping is I'm gonna start asking him how much his body influences his decision making. He has no idea what I'm talking about. How does the feeling in his heart or intestines influence his reasoning? He has no idea what I'm talking about. Um, does he have much imagery; no. Uh, and I do some nonverbals with him. He's, he's okay picking them up but he certainly doesn't show much of them. Um, you know, and we've already tapped into autobiographical memories, so. Anyway now we're at the end of the assessment. I know he's never gonna come back if I don't give him something to come back for. 

00:32:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:32:45
DANIEL SIEGEL So he goes, "Well, what do you think is going on now that you've asked these stupid questions?", he says, you know. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:32:50
DANIEL SIEGEL So I said, "Well, I, I don't know for sure cuz, we've only been talking for one session. But the feeling I get is you're not depressed. He goes, "Of course, I'm not depressed.", you know. And he goes, "Any idiot could tell me that." And I said, "Okay." But I get the feeling from these brief questions, it's just a feeling I have that, you know, when you say, " I feel nothing that my colleague is dying." That that's something that you really have a question about. So, now, I'm tuning into, I'm been tuning into his internal state the whole time but now I'm tuning into his concern. 

00:33:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:25
DANIEL SIEGEL And I said, and I just wonder, you're 92 and I just wonder if you wanna learn more about that maybe do something about that. And he goes, "Well what could you do about it, I'm 92?" I said, "Well", then I bring in the neuroplasticity piece. The brain is always open to change across a life span. 

00:33:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:45
DANIEL SIEGEL He goes, "What does it have to do with my brain? We're talking about my feelings." He says that, right. 

00:33:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:50
DANIEL SIEGEL So I said, "Well the brain is part of what the mind is, it's not the whole thing. The mind is in your brain and body. And the mind is in your relationships. It's those two places. And he goes, "Well, you know, what would you do about it?" I said, "Well, here's what I think is going on." I said, "There's a hint, I don't know for sure that you may be very dominant in one side of your brain and not in the other. Cuz here's the list of things: autobiographical memory, feelings uh, awareness of your body, you know, all that stuff. 

00:34:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:34:15
DANIEL SIEGEL And it seems underdeveloped. I don't say it's dead. I don't say not there. The other side of your brain as an attorney, of course, is super charged; logic, linear thinking, language, writing, list making. 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON Literality, you know that you're literal. 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Anything else, okay. 

00:34:30
DANIEL SIEGEL So, so I just have a feeling that you've been living with half of brain. 

00:34:30
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:34:30
DANIEL SIEGEL And it's the half that doesn't let you feel things. 

00:34:35
RICH SIMON Wow! 

00:34:35
DANIEL SIEGEL And it's making you, like anything that's not integrated have either chaos in your life. Which sometimes you get a rigidity in your life which sometimes you get. And I don't know if you need to live like that. He goes, "Well, I feel like I'm kind of dead even though I'm alive." He says that. 

00:34:45
RICH SIMON Mmm. Okay. 

00:34:50
DANIEL SIEGEL "And I wonder if there's any way I can feel more alive." I said, "I think there is." And I actually believe that. I'm not just saying that to get him to come back. 

00:34:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, right. 

00:35:00
DANIEL SIEGEL So, that begins the journey, right. It's an assessment of CAS rigidity. It's not a stamping on his forehead, some DSM diagnosis. 

00:35:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:35:05
DANIEL SIEGEL Maybe or maybe he needs one because some people do, some people don't. But the issue is, if people can have trouble in their minds without needing a diagnostic criteria but they still have impairment to integration. And the great news is that we as mental health practitioners can offer them relational experiences and mind training experiences that alter the integrative functioning of their brains so their relationships can become more integrated. Honor differences, promoting linkages, and they can have more vitality in their life. Become more flexible, adaptive, coherent, energized, stable if phases flow. 

00:35:40
RICH SIMON So, (crosstalk) before we move, move on to the next stage of what you do, let me just sort of underline some of the stuff and maybe uh, we can direct people. Because you're, you're uh, very graciously condensing uh, something that's quite intricate and complex into our time format here. So, fortunately you've written about this in the network or in this uh, this, this whole notion of do-, domains of integration and people will have a link to the piece that you wrote about the complexity choir in the network. 

00:36:10
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:36:10
RICH SIMON So they can unpack what you're saying. But basically you're saying in this first phase, you're coming into that first session and there are these you have your uh, very relationally oriented. You're initially these, this construct of, of, of chaos and rigidity. You're just feeling for that, you're looking for that, you're responding to it internally. You're asking questions that give some sense of that with, with your uh, with the, the client. Uh, you're uh, moving on and then you're beginning to have with your map of the brain, hearing what they have to say. And beginning to map on their descriptions of; and here are the key point seems to be this idea about is the first time he's really reaching out to you and asking implicitly anything is this sense of not feeling. And then you bringing to bear all your uh, very complex knowledge about the brain. And then as you move into the relationship having kept stock of, of, kept track of all of your own responses to uh, this gentlemen you have this more intricate notion; domains of integration. And becomes, you, you move into a greater level of complexity. As you understand uh, the, you try to understand where he fits that. You brought in, you're listening for this attachment history. Well, maybe we'll talk a little bit more about the attach- adult attachment interview and how that figures into it. But at the very end of the session you're part of what you're trying to do with a client like this, is condition to assessment giving him some sense of what it is in his terms, his psychotherapy in particularly this relationship with you might have to offer him. 

00:37:55
DANIEL SIEGEL Completely, right. And, and, and, and the last piece is so important to. 

00:38:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:38:00
DANIEL SIEGEL To attune and align with his own kernel of interest. This is a 92-year old who's never been in psychotherapy before. 

00:38:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:38:05
DANIEL SIEGEL And I, let me tell you, I saw him just uh, uh, last week. Uh, he's much old, much, much older than 92 and, and all these things that he learned. And we'll talk, we'll talk about treatment planning and treatment adaptation phase. And you can, you know, in The Mind Sight, book you hear his case. 

00:38:20
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:38:25
DANIEL SIEGEL But he's used these ways his brain has ultimately become more integrated and adaptive. It's a phase that life challenges that happen when you're, you know, at the end of the sen-, you know. 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON Of course. 

00:38:35
DANIEL SIEGEL (inaudible ) Uh, and, and, and it's, it's so beautiful to, to be in a relationship with him. Uh, and to, to continue to work with him uh, in these deep ways. And I think I like to use Stewart as a case because he's in his 90's uh, to remind people of the studies in neuroplasticity. 

00:38:55
RICH SIMON Possible. 

00:38:55
DANIEL SIEGEL That you know, it, it, you know, it, it, your brain, a healthy brain. I mean a brain where you're eating well. 

00:39:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:00
DANIEL SIEGEL You're sleeping well. You're getting exercise. These are all things that feed the body. 

00:39:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:05
DANIEL SIEGEL You, you're able to change. So, it isn't just like someone sits in a, in a chair nothing happens. You got to try to keep the body healthy. Um. 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so as we. 

00:39:10
DANIEL SIEGEL And those are all important parts of mental health. 

00:39:15
RICH SIMON Okay, so, in our, you know, we're, we're, we have our limited time here. But I, I'd love for folks to get a, this full picture of the process. So let's move into the, the treatment planning phase, if that's okay. And take. 

00:39:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:39:25
RICH SIMON Us with this, your story here and let's see if we can in the uh, 25 minutes or so that we have left to see if we can uh, get people uh, kind of the overall arch of what happened with Stewart. So, what, what. 

00:39:40
DANIEL SIEGEL Sure. 

00:39:40
RICH SIMON Did you move into treatment planning. Then give us. 

00:39:40
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:39:40
RICH SIMON The flavor, what happened? 

00:39:45
DANIEL SIEGEL So the assessment, you know, phase is chaos or rigidity. Then you have to ask the question uh, you know, what domain of integration is not integrated so that it is yielding what you found in your assessment. And so, treatment planning naturally evolves from asking that question in the assessment there's a natural movement then to treatment planning. Which you say, okay. You know, he's experiencing rigidity interpersonally. He is not engaging with people at work anymore. Even though, he's retired he used to go in. He's not engage, engaging with his uh, kids or grandchildren. So he's shutting down interpersonally. Internally he's expressed a rigidity as well. You know, where uh, he's not aware of his feelings and things like that. And um, he's expressed also not explicitly but implicitly his incoherence, his chaos uh, when it comes to um, you know, issues about terror and dependency. And all this stuff when his wife was ill. So, there's a, you know, if you want to call it trauma in the sense that it overwhelms his ability to adapt flexibly. That's how you define trauma. His wife going into the hospital just before coming for his evaluation um, is a possible traumatic experience. If you, if you define trauma in that broad sense of overwhelming ability of a person or system to adapt. Okay. 

00:41:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:05
DANIEL SIEGEL So, so now the treatment planning has got to say we've identified chaos, rigidity's three different areas. Um, which domain does that involve? Well, the treatment planning for anyone for the integration of consciousness, even if they don't have impaired integration there, all string that is very important. And what does that mean? Well, our treatment planning approach involves the wheel of awareness. Uh, it's a, it's a uh, thing you and I've talked about for which we literally teach how to integrate consciousness. 

00:41:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:35
DANIEL SIEGEL Uh, it was created years ago in this office around that table where. 

00:41:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:45
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, uh, I would just walk around with my patients. I would walk around this table and say, "Hey, you know, this center hub, there's a glass thing over there, you know, is a, the knowing and the outer rim of this table which we ultimately call the wheel, you know, is what the known. Like what you see, what you hear, what you taste, etc., what you feel in your body. What you know in your thoughts, your feelings, your memories, your hopes, your dreams, your attitudes, your intentions, all that mental life, and even your relational sense. So we have these four sectors that explore the outside world, the body world, the mind world, and the relational world. Um, and then allowing people to go through that wheel practice even if that's not the main problem that's causing them impaired. 

00:42:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:42:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Integration where they have chaos, rigidity. It's a way of sort of strengthening the mind uh, from the inside out. And so I have people do the wheel of awareness. 

00:42:40
RICH SIMON And giving them a metaphor of this, of, for their own experience. 

00:42:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Completely. 

00:42:45
RICH SIMON It becomes a shared frame of reference between you and the client. 

00:42:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Right. So someone can say I was lost on the rim. I have to really build up my hub, that kind of thing. 

00:42:50
RICH SIMON That's right. 

00:42:50
DANIEL SIEGEL And you can, you know, I, they, they, they pull it from my website, you know, Dr.DanSiegel.com, like anyone can for free. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:00
DANIEL SIEGEL We just give it out, you know. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:43:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Tens of thousands people are using it and we get just fantastic feedback. It was designed to be an integration consciousness practice. My Mindfulness colleagues tell me it meets criteria for a Mindfulness practice. Which is beautiful. 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:15
DANIEL SIEGEL But it wasn't designed to be that because it was designed. 

00:43:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:15
DANIEL SIEGEL In a time I didn't even know there was something called Mindfulness. 

00:43:20
RICH SIMON It just emerged, right. Okay. 

00:43:20
DANIEL SIEGEL But that's fine. So, you can say it's a Mindfulness practice but from the domains of integration it was actually designed to be and is a way you differentiate the knowing from the known, and differentiate all the known from each other. And then you link them with a spoke. It goes around the rim from the hub. And that's a spoke of attention. So, we have attention, awareness, and the known. You know, the, the object of your focus of attention. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Anyway, and you systematically and metaphorically, there's no wheel anywhere except here in the office. You know, there's no wheel anywhere in your, but now you have the metaphor. And then you know, in the packet you've got, Interpersonal Neuro, I just explore in detail what that means and the Mindful therapist, you can explore try that out for yourselves. So, so, everyone gets it as a treatment planning thing. It's sort of like basic brushing your teeth, you know. 

00:44:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:44:10
DANIEL SIEGEL Everyone should be brushing their teeth for their health. Everyone should be doing some kind of integration practice, whether you call it a Mindfulness practice, doing the breath practice for us is good. You know, but it's certainly an integration consciousness. 

00:44:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:44:20
DANIEL SIEGEL Now we come to bilateral integration, integrating left and right. This is Stewart's main thing. 

00:44:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:30
DANIEL SIEGEL So, and we'll use this just as an example of you know, treatment planning. 

00:44:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:35
DANIEL SIEGEL So, we say he has a big, big uh, domain of integration bilateral that's not working well. And integration depends on two things, differentiating the different stuff of that domain and then linking it. 

00:44:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:55
DANIEL SIEGEL So, now we're gonna ask, Okay, then Stewart is his problem that he hasn't differentiated right hemisphere from left? You know, is there not a well developed left and a well developed right that can be linked. And so, I'm now gonna test more into that. So in the second session in treatment planning. 

00:45:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:10
DANIEL SIEGEL It's an evolved dynamic process. I need to know more about that. So I do some nonverbal signal things with Stewart to see can he really pick them up, and he can. Can he imitate them, he can. 

00:45:25
RICH SIMON Like, like what? What did you, what do you mean nonverbal signal things? 

00:45:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Okay. So, I go, uh, "Stewart, uh, do." Let's say you're Stewart. I said, um, "Just do what I do." 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:35
DANIEL SIEGEL Right. So that's. 

00:45:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:45
DANIEL SIEGEL So basic facial expressions. 

00:45:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Um, I might do gestures. 

00:45:45
RICH SIMON That's pretty fun. I. 

00:45:45
DANIEL SIEGEL It is fun. It's actually incredibly fun. 

00:45:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:45:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Uh, so. 

00:45:50
RICH SIMON I feel really close to you right now, Dan. 

00:45:55
DANIEL SIEGEL Well, I want to hug you Rich. 

00:45:55
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:45:55
DANIEL SIEGEL So, so we do that, right. It is a way of getting very close. 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:46:00
DANIEL SIEGEL In fact, that becomes. 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:00
DANIEL SIEGEL A relational piece. 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:00
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, how close can he feel and still feel comfortable when as, as we find out later on, you know, being close was something that was dangerous for him as a kid, so. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON And some people uh, presumably that if, if you, you would do that for some people this, oh, of course this is automatic. But this is not a universal. 

00:46:20
DANIEL SIEGEL Oh, no, no, no. I've had other patients. Yeah, they just, they said, "I can't do that. I won't do that. I, I'm not able to do that. I don't know what you're talking about." 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON I can't, I won't, it's just. 

00:46:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Or they try to, you know, they do this. I have one patient, I won't talk about him but a different client. 

00:46:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:35
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, where he cannot do this stuff. His right hemisphere was so undeveloped, I mean we had to work with basic things of getting those muscles to work. 

00:46:40
RICH SIMON He, he can't mirror the facial expressions. 

00:46:45
DANIEL SIEGEL No. 

00:46:45
RICH SIMON Of another human being. 

00:46:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Not Stewart but the other folks. 

00:46:45
RICH SIMON Yeah, the other fella, yeah. 

00:46:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Stewart had some, you know, differentiation of the right but not that much. I had to really do it with him. And at some point what I want to see if he can name it, you know. Uh, uh, there's an interesting moment of integrating left and right when you have someone like be aware of their different body parts because that's a, the whole body is a right. But, but if you're just talking about sensations like in the touch. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:10
DANIEL SIEGEL You can do this yourself right now. Just feel where your right foot is touching the your socks, if you're wearing socks. 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. 

00:47:15
DANIEL SIEGEL And now try your left foot, where your left foot is touching your socks. And now see if you can feel both feet at the same time. 

00:47:25
RICH SIMON Oh, that's quite different isn't it. 

00:47:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:47:30
RICH SIMON It's a little tougher. 

00:47:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:47:30
RICH SIMON Yeah, it's a little tougher, isn't it. Yeah, I can get it. I can get there. 

00:47:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON But it's not, it's not as easy as I thought. 

00:47:35
DANIEL SIEGEL You, you know, Stewart and other people like Stewart could not do that. 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay. Interesting, okay. 

00:47:40
DANIEL SIEGEL So, that's an example where. 

00:47:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:40
DANIEL SIEGEL You got the right working, the right fields, the touch of the left foot, the left hemisphere feels the touch of the right foot. But to get the corpus callosum linking the two hemispheres you got to do both at the same time. 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, it is different. 

00:47:50
DANIEL SIEGEL He could not do it. 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:55
DANIEL SIEGEL So, that's just a feeling for a little fun trick. I mean it's fun when you know about brain anatomy and brain function. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:48:00
DANIEL SIEGEL To see how the mind is being influenced by in this case a lack of linkage of two somewhat developed, at least in the sense of his nonverbal signals. Now when it came to his awareness of his body, the internal state of his body, no; un-, undeveloped. 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:15
DANIEL SIEGEL When it came to talking about feelings which begins in the right, the right is more closely connected to lower his limbic area, including the amygdale, the brain stem and the body proper is more a direct flow to the right. 

00:48:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Stewart did not have that. 

00:48:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:30
DANIEL SIEGEL He, and I could go into details. I'll mention it to you in I guess 30 second thing. 

00:48:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:48:35
DANIEL SIEGEL This stream of information from the body that is riding on energy patterns through laminal one, the 10th cranial nerve come up to something called the right insula, the right interior insula. And the right interior insula also communicates to the right interior singula which makes a map of the whole body through these neurons called vonoconomo(ph) neurons. Wide broad connecting neurons that only link anterior singulet to anterior insulet especially in the right side of the brain. Now there's a correlation to introception sense of what Stewart could not feel. What's going on in my body and how does that influence my emotions. Okay. That's introception. 

00:49:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:15
DANIEL SIEGEL With vonoconomo(ph) neurons. Now, we don't know exactly what gets them to develop. We know they're correlated with introceptability. We know introceptability increases with Mindfulness. We know introceptability increases with empathy. Which Stewart had a very low level of. 

00:49:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:30
DANIEL SIEGEL We know introceptability goes along with um, your ability to have emotions and regulate them. So, these are all things Stewart was not differentiated. 

00:49:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:35
DANIEL SIEGEL He was, differentiate means develop basically. 

00:49:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:40
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, and, and made distinct and unique. So in that assessment elaboration I need to work with Stewart systematically at not so much the nonverbal stuff, he's good at that. But I had him practice that with the sound turned off on the television set, so homework cuz I want all my patients to do homework. 

00:50:00
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:50:00
DANIEL SIEGEL He's watching television shows with no sound. So his left hemisphere can't get the language, it gets distracted. His right has to look at all the incredible nonverbal signals that actors are so exquisite. 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:10
DANIEL SIEGEL At demonstrating. That's what they're paid to do. 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Right. Uh, okay. So, I do that for homework for the nonverbals. I work with him of being aware of his body with a body scan. There's all sorts of issues that come up, we don't have enough time to talk about that. But just slowly developing his right interior insulas, his communication, with the right interior singulet through the vonoconomo(ph) neurons. That's what I believe is going on. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:35
DANIEL SIEGEL It's the gateway to empathy. So I'm gonna ultimately start working with that. I'm gonna also get him to be aware autobiographical memory. Not about his childhood, which he'll never be able encode cuz it's over. But I can encode his experiences with his wife now, encode his experiences with getting up in the morning and coming to see me. I can encode what he thought about what happened between us 20 minutes ago, even. All these are right hemisphere dominant. So I'm gonna start developing those right hemisphere circuits not for gaining access to what was never encoded I think in his childhood. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:05
DANIEL SIEGEL But what happened 10 minutes ago with us. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:10
DANIEL SIEGEL What happened this morning with his wife. You know, what happened three weeks ago when his wife was hospitalized, you see. 

00:51:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:15
DANIEL SIEGEL This is all enriched, these are all elaborate with each other. Your feelings in your body, your access to nonverbal signals, your emotions, your autobiographical memory are all enriching his right hemisphere self. 

00:51:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:51:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Which is both embodied and social. 

00:51:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:30
DANIEL SIEGEL It's also quite directly emotional. Emotion is on both sides of the brain. And now I'm gonna take his super well-developed left, whose always my ally in this because I'm explaining him to the neuro-anatomy with, to Stewart as we go in this treatment planning phase. And I said, "I've got to develop these parts of your brain. This isn't hocus-pocus." These are things I don't know why. We do a little more of the adult attachment interview and explore why. And in fact his wife comes in and helps us say, his parents were the most um, unavailable, emotionally barren people she has met in her entire life. 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:52:05
DANIEL SIEGEL And she's met a lot of people. 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:05
DANIEL SIEGEL With the work she does. I mean never, two people, so we got a double whammy of emotional bareness, right. And so now, what I'm gonna do is see it this way. And I say it to Stewart. I said, "Look, your right hemispheres like a diamond in the rough. It never got polished by the nurturance of an emotionally available set of caregivers. 

00:52:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Right. And you know, these right hemisphere circuits haven't died. They're like um, you know, a seed which is ready to develop into a beautiful tree. 

00:52:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:40
DANIEL SIEGEL But the water wasn't there so its encapsulated and protected. And you've encapsulated yourself with an adaptation of avoidance as a kid and what we call dismissing attachment as an adult, after we do the adult attachment interview. Which doesn't say that's the way you're gonna be the rest of your life cuz as John Molby and Mary Aimesworth always said, "Attachments changeable." 

00:53:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:00
DANIEL SIEGEL So what we have to do is say what happened, your right hemisphere was underdeveloped. Your left took over and kept you safe, fine. Good for you. 

00:53:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:53:10
DANIEL SIEGEL Now, do you want to live a life where you feel nothing about your colleague dying? And you can't be in touch with the feelings you have about life in general and so life feels flat. Or do you want to try to live a life of feelings which originate from the body and from the lower structures of the nervous system and up into the right hemisphere first. And left is really important. But bringing these two together is really important so. 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:30
DANIEL SIEGEL You can have accompany, because he knows about accompanies that collaborates its different divisions. They work together. 

00:53:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:53:35
DANIEL SIEGEL So we do that and ultimately we're working all these right hemispheres processes, that's a treatment planning. 

00:53:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:45
DANIEL SIEGEL And he starts developing these other things that I never thought he would develop. Uh, sort of on his own. We focus primarily on bilateral integration. 

00:53:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:50
DANIEL SIEGEL And this is sort of getting into the treatment implementation in addition to planning. But what. 

00:53:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:55
DANIEL SIEGEL The best laid plans are sometimes undone by the incredible resilience of the power of the healing process. 

00:54:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Which is ultimately the integration process in our view. Once integration starts happening and the safety of the relationship between me and, and Stewart is emerging the treatment implementation unfolds and he starts becoming more empathic with me. He starts developing more kindness and compassion towards himself. He starts getting access to feelings that he never had before. 

00:54:25
RICH SIMON And how does this sound? Just, to give us a little bit of the flavor of how this emerges. 

00:54:30
DANIEL SIEGEL I'll give you an example. Uh. 

00:54:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:54:30
DANIEL SIEGEL You know, one time he came in for a session in the process of working on bilateral integration. And he said, "Dan, you know, this." And I have a bunch of poetry from him actually sitting here in the drawer. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:54:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Which you know. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Wow. 

00:54:45
DANIEL SIEGEL He didn't give me permission to print. But um. 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:50
DANIEL SIEGEL It, it, he started writing poetry. That's one way that it showed up. 

00:54:55
RICH SIMON Wow. 

00:54:55
DANIEL SIEGEL Which he, which blew him away. I mean he said, "I don't know why I'm doing this but here." 

00:54:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:55:00
DANIEL SIEGEL And then what we ended up doing was, is creat-, uh, it's gonna bring tears to my eyes, you know. Right here in this chair I mean he'd bring these things in. He'd go I don't know what's going on with me Here. I said, "Well do you want to read it to me?" He goes, "I want you to read it to me." And I would take his poems and it was like a pattern that we developed, relationally, you know. 

00:55:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:55:20
DANIEL SIEGEL I would take in his, you, you can feel them. I wish I could read them to you but you'd feel these right hemisphere, you know, unbelievable expressions of vulnerability and subtle awareness's of things going on. And I would read them to him and he would feel really, really close to me. 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:55:45
DANIEL SIEGEL It's, really the attunement was so exquisite because I'd read them, I'd read him his words and he would be able to sit and see me soak the man. And because they were so evocative emotionally I mean, I would get teary or I'd get emotional or get enraged depending on what it's all about. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:05
DANIEL SIEGEL You'd see, you know. And so it became this beautiful thing that we had. And, so that's one part. But one time he comes in and he says, "I just got to tell you something that happened." I said, "What happened?" He goes, "You know, we had, we had these friends over for dinner. And we were having dinner, it was fine. And I started just feeling really, really depressed. And I don't ever remember feeling anything like that." 

00:56:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:30
DANIEL SIEGEL "And our friends left and I went to my wife and I've never done this before. And I said, "I need to talk to you." 

00:56:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:35
DANIEL SIEGEL And she, I see her eyes go, go what. Cuz that's not how he talked, you know. He goes, "I'm just feeling something really bad." She goes, "What are you feeling?" He goes, "I don't know. It's like I got this heaviness here and I just, I guess I feel like I want to cry. I don't know." She goes, "Well what's going on?" So he pauses, and he and I had all, all this talk in our, you know, developing his right hemisphere. We talked about the mirror neuron system which I really call the sponge neuron system. Where you sponge in the feelings of other people and sponge in their behaviors and stuff. So, uh, he's talking about these sponge neurons, the mirror neurons. And he said, "I said to my wife, "Oh, my god I realize our friend just told us he was diagnosed with cancer and they did, they only gave him three months to live." And I realized how ho-, hopeless I feel for him. How helpless he feels because his cancers so progressed. 

00:57:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:30
DANIEL SIEGEL And how sad, sad I feel. And he starts to cry in the office here. 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:35
DANIEL SIEGEL With me, telling me about telling his wife about his feelings. And he goes, "Then I thought to myself, it's the mirror neurons. My mirror neurons were sponging in my friend's pain." And this is his pain not mine. So, I can stay with it cuz it's about his sadness and his predicament. And it sort of lifted me up. The depression started lifting and I started actually feeling okay. I felt really, really sad for him. I could feel how much. 

00:58:05
RICH SIMON He, he's saying all this to you? Yeah. 

00:58:10
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah, he's saying this to me. 

00:58:10
RICH SIMON Yeah, right. 

00:58:10
DANIEL SIEGEL And he goes and then the evening was fine after that with my wife. 

00:58:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:58:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Instead of feeling depressed I just felt sad for my friend. Instead of just being oppressive I felt kind of, the clarity of the incredibly grateful for life. 

00:58:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:58:25
DANIEL SIEGEL And this was part of the integration of consciousness. You could see that from understanding the sponge neuron, the mirror neurons that it was a point on his rim, and that's what he talked about. And from his hub he could be open to the incredible mystery of life and the majesty of being able to just be present for whatever arises. Which is the integration of consciousness. And in the bilateral step for the first time ever he went to his wife from an interpersonal integration point of view and said. 

00:58:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:58:50
DANIEL SIEGEL "I'm feeling something different from you but I'm feeling something that I don't understand." You, my wife of 65 years, you can help me explore this thing that feels really bad. And then all this empathy started emerging. This guy became like this maven of mind sight, you know, seeing the mind in himself, other. And to this day, years and years later he's still that way. I mean. 

00:59:15
RICH SIMON How old is he today? 

00:59:15
DANIEL SIEGEL I can't say. 

00:59:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:59:15
DANIEL SIEGEL But he's nearing, nearing a hundred mark. 

00:59:20
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay. All right. 

00:59:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Um, and I can say that part, you know, but. 

00:59:25
RICH SIMON Okay, fine. 

00:59:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Uh, you know, uh, you know, and what's so beautiful that I see him today is, um, I mean, a couple of weeks ago or whenever it was, a few, last week or the week after, uh, the week before that. You know, is that he, these changes that are happening in your brain are not just momentary feeling good. He's developed the skill of empathy, he understands the way connections with other people have. He understands life as an evolving process. We have, there's, there's a domain of integration we deal with too called, um, temporal integration. Where you realize that your brain is embodying time. And Stewart and I have worked on that. And so he's facing new issues today that are directly related to life's uncertainty that, that nothing last forever and that we all die, well at 90 nearing 100 he's of course. 

01:00:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:10
DANIEL SIEGEL That happens. 

01:00:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:00:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Most of his friends have passed away. So uh, these temporal integration issues combined with the state integration, different states he can get to. In this example, I'm talking. 

01:00:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:25
DANIEL SIEGEL About the mirror neurons, uh, that was a state I was in, now I'm in a different state. 

01:00:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Interpersonal integration, vertical integration, being in touch with his body. Um, memory integration, autobiographical narrative integration, everyone of the eight domains of integration we worked on. For Stewart there is a sense of a ninth thing that emerges kind of spontaneously, transpiration integration. It's kind of an integration of identity where you have expanded sense of identity. 

01:00:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:50
DANIEL SIEGEL He does feel that. There's all sorts of ways I can't talk about the details but I can say the general statement that there are ways in which his life has been expanded in the sense of who he is. And his connection to family, to friends, yes that's interpersonal integration but just to the larger sense of humanity in things that he's doing. 

01:01:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:01:10
DANIEL SIEGEL With his efforts. So. 

01:01:10
RICH SIMON So. 

01:01:10
DANIEL SIEGEL That's transpiration integration. So, even though we don't try all the other ones kind of emerge. Integration creates integration. This is the cool thing. I mean you get over the adaptations that lock your rigidity and chaos, you do your assessment, you do your treatment planning. You start doing your treatment implementation then you just participate in this beautiful unfolding of integration. And because it's a nonlinear system you don't know where it's gonna go. Small inputs to help get over a, a blockage lead to large, and when it's integration positive changes that are, are wonderful to behold. Uh, and you let the natural movement toward healing emerge. 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON That's uh, really lovely. What a, what a, a, what a great example. What a great case and what a gripping story that's continuing to evolve. We're, we're uh, all, just about out of time here for this conversation. We want to just remind people that uh, um, that uh, that we're inviting them to be part of the conversation. So all of you folks out there, there's a comment board. Uh, please give us your, what this triggered in you. What this uh, extraordinary case, thoughts about it, ideas, connections with your own experience. What you learned. This is the integrating your own experience through the process of participating in this comment board. Um, and Dan, will uh, has agreed to look at these comments and, and uh, and again not write an encylopedian response but if he's so moved he may. You may hear back from him. But in any case uh, really invite you to, to comment. Dan, for, um, people who are interested in finding out more about your work there's a number of readings of things that you have contributed to the Networker that I would highly recommend, that uh, people who, will be able to get on the site. Um, and uh, so if they want to find out more about your approach and more about this, this way in which you've integrated brain science into therapeutic practice where do they go? 

01:03:15
DANIEL SIEGEL So, if you go to DrDanSiegal.com, D-R-D-A-N-S-I-E-G-E-L.com that's the, uh, connection to the Mindsight Institute. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON And that's, and that's a link on, on the Networker (crosstalk) course. Okay. 

01:03:30
DANIEL SIEGEL There's also MindsightInstitute.com, there's are both active sites. 

01:03:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:03:35
DANIEL SIEGEL But they're linked to each other. 

01:03:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:03:35
DANIEL SIEGEL Um, what you'll find is the Mindsight community which is the home for interpersonal neurobiology. You'll find the three year on-line training program. You could take any or all parts of that. 

01:03:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:03:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Um, you'll find access to our annual interpersonal neurobiology meeting. You'll find uh, information about our, you know, literally two and a half dozen textbooks in interpersonal neurobiology. You'll find access to videos, to audio programs, you'll get the free wheel of awareness practice and other Mindsight practices. Um, and you'll really become a part of a community. We really believe. 

01:04:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:04:10
DANIEL SIEGEL This is all about a Mindsight community that can support each other in whatever work you're doing in mental health, in education of all sorts, in parenting, contemplative practice, in organizational functioning. Across the board in all these different areas including the other arenas uh, this is something we do together as a community. And um, we have monthly meetings that happen. There's all sorts of fun stuff we do. And so please come join us. 

01:04:40
RICH SIMON Thank, thanks. So people have that link and uh, I, I strongly recommend that you, you, you uh, take up Dan's invitation and you checkout this, these sites. So, it's just a wealth of resources most of which are free. Dan, thank you so much! 

01:04:55
DANIEL SIEGEL Rich, great to see you. 

01:04:55
RICH SIMON For sharing your work and sharing your uh, work with Stewart. And uh. 

01:05:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Yes. 

01:05:00
RICH SIMON We uh, I think we all feel apart of that relationship that you've described so compellingly uh, here for us this afternoon. 

01:05:10
DANIEL SIEGEL Thank you. I'm sure if Stewart were here he would say thank you. Thank you too. Thank you from us both. 

01:05:15
RICH SIMON Uh, uh, quite, quite a tale of transformation. 

01:05:20
DANIEL SIEGEL Yep. 

01:05:20
RICH SIMON Um, that's it for this first installment let, of this series Neuroscience In Action. We're off to a great start. We look forward to seeing you next time. Bye-bye.
