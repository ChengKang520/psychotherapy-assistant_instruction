Explaining PTSD is Part of Treating PTSD Lessons for Mental Health Professionals A Presentation of Gift From Within 

00:00:05
The goal of this program is to introduce clinicians, therapists and mental health professionals to post-traumatic stress disorder, to help them learn what PTSD is, how it affects sufferers and their families, and how best to explain what PTSD is in a clinical setting. Dr. Frank Ochberg is a psychiatrist and former associate director of the National Institute of Mental Health. He is one of the team members who wrote the medical definition for post-traumatic stress disorder. 

00:00:30
Frank Ochberg, MD Psychiatrist and PTSD Expert 

00:00:30
Dr. Ochberg was the editor of the first treatment text in America for PTSD and is a recipient of the lifetime achievement award from the International Society for traumatic stress studies. 

00:00:40
Angie Panos, PhD Clinical Psychologist 

00:00:45
Doctor Angie Panos holds a PhD in clinical psychology. She is a licenced marriage and family therapist and a licenced clinical social worker. She has more than 20 years experience in traumatic stress treatment dealing with war refugees, domestic violence, victims of rape, and child abuse. Doctor Ochberg and doctor Panos are friends of gift from within. Historically, PTSD has been referred to as depression, anxiety disorder, paranoid or battle fatigue. It has only been recently that the symptoms were seen in the larger context of post-traumatic stress disorder. Why is it important for clinicians to understand how to explain PTSD? 

00:01:30
ANGIE PANOS It's very important for clinicians to understand how to explain post-traumatic stress disorder to their clients because they're setting the foundation for the information that that person needs to know to guide them in their healing and recovery process. 

00:01:50
FRANK OCHBERG Explaining PTSD is… is actually an important part of treating the PTSD. You are dealing with a situation that can be baffling to your patient, your client. They wanna know that you are familiar with this. They wanna know that when they talk with you about the event that happened to them, you are gonna be able to handle it. 

00:02:20
PTSD is insidious and can be particularly difficult to discern. What is PTSD? 

00:02:20
What is PTSD? • Being Haunted by the Event, Reoccuring Nightmares or Flashbacks • Emotional Anesthesia •Having Too Much Adrenaline Irritabilty, Jumpiness, Sleeplessness 

00:02:25
FRANK OCHBERG Post traumatic stress disorder is three things at once. First being haunted by the event, the memory of the event, the sensations, the feeling of the event comes back when you don't expect it, when you don't want it, it can wake you up in the middle of the night. It… it can be like a hallucination during the day. The second part of PTSD is almost the opposite of the first. It's having emotional anesthesia you… you don't feel, you are a diminished human being. You might think of this as something that fortunately protects you from feeling horror and terror, but unfortunately, it robs you of joy and hope and love. In the last part of PTSD is like having too much adrenaline. You are jumping, you are nervous, you can't concentrate, you don't sleep well, all those things happening for atleast a month or diagnosed as PTSD. 

00:03:25
Unfortunately, there are many events in today's world that can cause severe emotional injury, but not all of them will lead to post traumatic stress disorder. What causes PTSD? 

00:03:35
What Causes PTSD? • Exposure to Events Outside the Realm of Normal Human Experience • Child Abuse • Severe Auto Accidents • Life Threatening Natural Disasters • Exposure to war, i.e. combat vets 

00:03:40
ANGIE PANOS Post traumatic stress disorder is caused by exposure to events that are outside of the realm of normal human experience, things that are horrific, things that are life-threatening, being abused as a child, car accidents, natural disasters such as tornadoes or earthquakes in which your life was threatened, and you saw horrific around you, people who participate in war, combat veterans, who either have their own life threatened or have to take life. So there is a range of horrific, terrible tragic things that people can be exposed to any of these can cause post traumatic stress disorder. 

00:04:20
When in therapy should I begin the educational process with a client? 

00:04:20
Education is a key component of treating PTSD. When in therapy should the clinician begin the educational process with the client? 

00:04:30
FRANK OCHBERG I invariably started on day one, and it doesn't have to be a lot of material, but I might start it by saying do you know what PTSD is. They will tell me yes or no, I'll ask a little bit more about, what they know about it or how they are going about it and then use those cues and those clues to begin. And as they get it, that’s so therapeutic because they may have been a drift, there has been very little that they've accomplished in the way of self -improvement. One of the goals of post traumatic therapy is to have your patient or your client know about PTSD and when they leave your office, day one having learned something, they wanna come back for more. 

00:05:20
ANGIE PANOS The research continues to show that your report and your relationship with the client is a key healing factor and that's the foundation of what you are trying to do? With PTSD educating them is also so vital and important. 

00:05:35
FRANK OCHBERG What the first thing that I do or often on the first meeting is take out the DSM-IV, show them what the book is, show them the criteria in the book and I… I literally get up and I walk over, sometimes pull a chair over, so that we are sitting next to each other and looking at the book together that the physical nature of that act, the sharing of information, giving them a chance to look at it and ask about it and go through it together, that's… that's the form of therapy that I think works best and it… it is coeducation. You don't wanna be too much the professor, teacher, because so often the person with PTSD has been degraded that they may have even been held hostage, they have lost their dignity, their humanity and they wanna know that you know what they have been through and that you are an expert, but they also wanna get on this search with you. So you'll learn together. 

00:06:40
Post traumatic stress disorder can be confusing and difficult to understand when being described by a clinician. How much detail should I use when describing PTSD? 

00:06:50
How much detail should I use when describing PTSD to a patient? 

00:06:50
ANGIE PANOS I think sometimes, you can overdo the detail when maybe someone is not ready to hear about it. So what you might do is to find for them a nice overview that and… and be watchful of their body language and… and how they are handling it and be sure that you are tuning into them and answering their questions if they seem like that's enough you could postpone that to a later time and say you know we'll talk a little more in depth about some of these symptoms at a later time, but right now I am giving you a general overview about it. 

00:07:30
FRANK OCHBERG You explain things in increasing detail as you find that your patient, your client, or the next of kin who is seeing you to learn about this, is ready to absorb that kind of information. Let's not forget early on, part of PTSD is a concentration disorder, and that's in the standard diagnostic criteria. So they are not gonna retain it. If you give somebody a bunch of material to read, take this home and read about PTSD, it's not the same as sitting with them and explaining it and having you be the one who explains it, countless times patients have said to me, you know doc, that's the first time anyone took the time to tell me what this is. 

00:08:20
PTSD is a medical diagnosis comprising various symptoms following exposure to severe trauma. How do I explain PTSD in terms my client can easily understand? 

00:08:30
FRANK OCHBERG Some people don’t really wanna know all about PTSD. They… they don’t wanna know the whole definition. They wanna know what’s happening to them and why. Let’s say a person has become very nervous and they are really not able to handle things because of the anxiety component of PTSD. You might wanna explain that by saying that well, you’ve become more high-strung, you’re like a… an expensive violin and it’s hard to reply and it’s hard to keep in tune. Your sensitivity helps you, you're more aware of things, but it hurts you because you’re more vulnerable. And… and you can sometimes give a metaphor that helps them put it in a positive light. 

00:09:20
Comparing PTSD to physical elements can be useful in helping clients understand and demystify PTSD. What are some useful metaphors for helping clients understand PTSD? 

00:09:30
FRANK OCHBERG One of them has to say, there is something that’s different about your memory system and the brain has a memory system. It’s… it's like a computer or sometimes I use an analogy to a television set that here you are, you are watching channel three and channel seven comes in and channel seven is the worst experience of your life. You don’t want it there, you wanna get it away. Ah… comparing the mind to the TV set or to the computer that dials up its own program and you’re gonna have to learn how to change that. And then saying in one of the ways that will get there is down the road, not right away, but down the road when you are more comfortable with me, I am more comfortable with you, we’re gonna have times when you dial channel seven up on purpose. But then you’ll be turning it on and you’ll be turning it off and you’re gonna learn how to have this haunting horrible memory voluntarily rather than involuntarily. But… but we’re not gonna get there right now. That’s very important and it’s a clinical tool. You… you… you give them a metaphor for their intrusive memory. You let them know that part of the disease is that this intrusive memory turns itself on and then you tell them, down the road we’re gonna use some techniques so that you turn it on and turn it off yourself. 

00:11:00
Should I use a medical analogy when explaining PTSD to a client? 

00:11:05
FRANK OCHBERG So I’ve sometimes compared PTSD to a broken bone or to diabetes. And the broken… the broken bone analogy is the simple one. If something happened to you, it’s not really an illness ah… people don’t think of a broken bone as being their fault, it’s going to heal, but as it heals, it may be painful and we have to be careful of that healing in a bad way getting infected and you can play of those analogies when you’re working with someone with PTSD. The diabetes analogy is very good for people who are unsure that a disorder that affects the brain is real, is medical, is… is physical. I… I… I would use this in quote sometimes when people are trying to trivialize PTSD. And… and most people understand that in diabetes you are missing a chemical that your body makes insulin, you’re not getting enough of it and it’s not doing its job. And in certain parts of PTSD, you can say that there are brain chemicals and you’re gonna to need a boost so that your own brain chemistry can work better. And… and then you can go on to explaining why a serotonin reuptake inhibitor would work and would help in pathways implicated in PTSD. 

00:12:35
Very often PTSD patients are fearful that therapy might trigger flashbacks or recurring nightmares. Are there sensitivities I should be aware of as I treat as client with PTSD? 

00:12:50
ANGIE PANOS One of the big challenges in explaining the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder to clients is you don’t want to (inaudible ) reinforce, maybe a negative belief that they’ve already developed about themselves like they might be saying, oh I am just crazy. Well you don’t want them to have that be the takeaway of your explanation. You want them to have their feelings validated, understand that they do have a disorder, understand the symptoms of that. But have ah… hope and know that healing is possible and know that there are some positive things that they can do with that. 

00:13:30
FRANK OCHBERG Well, you… you don’t wanna overestimate or underestimate the significance and… and the disability that might be associated with the disorder. Obviously, it’s a clinician’s job to inspire hope. And… and PTSD in general is a hopeful process. It’s not one that involves brain deterioration it’s not psychosis. So you can be optimistic, but you don’t wanna explain it in a way that says, oh it’s normal, I’ve heard so many people explain PTSD as a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. And in fact in the beginning I did that. Your patient with PTSD is a normal human being who has gone through a severe and for them an abnormal event. Now the consequences of this or of medical import, the result of them being normal and facing this abnormal event if they have PTSD as a disorder. Umm… and I think by now we should use that word that it is a disorder, it is disabling, you need professional help and we’re gonna do that together. 

00:14:55
By definition, sufferers of PTSD have suffered traumatic events, which can make counseling these clients unusually stressful. What are some common challenges clinicians face in treating PTSD? 

00:15:10
ANGIE PANOS I think there is a couple of challenges that clinicians run into. One particular case the clinician became so empathic and so overwhelmed with the client’s story that the client lost confidence in their ability to handle it and in fact felt like maybe they were harming the therapist. Well the patient shouldn’t be put in that… that role of having to worry about the therapist. So there is a proper amount of empathy that's important to show, but that… there does have to be a certain level of confidence there as well that you can create a safe atmosphere and can contain those intense emotions that the client wants to share with you. 

00:15:55
FRANK OCHBERG Ah… Some patients, clients are gonna to be concerned that you are gonna to ask questions that are going to cause them to have a flashback or a very uncomfortable first session. So pointing that out early that I've heard about you the referring source told me about it. And I don’t wanna go into great detail now. Let’s learn a little more about you and let’s learn a little more about PTSD is… is often clinically a good way to start. You’re showing sensitivity to their fear of your eliciting a flashback and to their fear of you being incapable of handling them or their concerns that you may not be that knowledgeable because they've been dealing with people who are not knowledgeable about them. 

00:16:50
PTSD can be caused by exposure to a wide variety of traumatic events from the accidental natural disasters, to the purposeful physical assault. How does the type of trauma affect the patient’s symptoms? 

00:17:05
ANGIE PANOS In dealing with PTSD you will notice that people who went through different types of crisis may have some specific issues relating to that crisis, for example war refugee who has lost everything in their life is going to (inaudible horrific dangers and… and sights. They're of course going to have many, many other practical issues to deal with. A sexual assault victim is going to have issues around their intimacy and around relationships and around how they feel about their body that might not necessarily affect an earthquake victim. So there are some differences in what it meant to them and differences in what they'll need to do to transform from that traumatic event to a… a full life again. 

00:18:05
It's not only adults who can suffer from PTSD, children who’ve endured trauma can also experience the syndrome. What’s the best way to talk to children about PTSD? 

00:18:15
FRANK OCHBERG What’s most important to a scared child is a fact that their parents can cope with them. And so if you can find a way of explaining what they’re going through and let them know that mom and dad understand this and then know that you’re gonna to get through this that this is something that will pass and they're right in the next room even when you are scared. That could be a good way of explaining that particular symptom to a child. They don’t need a whole lecture on the physiology of brain changes. 

00:18:50
What’s the best way to talk to victims of sexual abuse about PTSD? 

00:18:55
ANGIE PANOS For the clinician that’s dealing with victims of sexual abuse, there are some added dimensions that require some education and… and require some definition in addressing for them. I think for many women their umm… eating patterns change, their relationship to their own body changes, their feelings about intimacy with their partner, all of these things are issues that are going to need to be addressed and there may be deep embarrassment shame on the part of the patient to bring these kind of issues up. So if the clinician can kind of open the subject for discussion in a gentle way by giving factual information, it makes it much easier and much more relaxed for the patient to then discuss it. 

00:19:55
Very often the biggest challenge facing people with PTSD is the acceptance and understanding of those around them. How can I help support my patient’s friends and family? 

00:20:05
ANGIE PANOS I think it's very important for you as a clinician to remember that not only just the patient needs some education about post-traumatic stress disorder, but so does the key significant others in their life because they will be affected by this as well. So giving them a good understanding about what is happening with post-traumatic stress disorder and some things they can do to assist in the healing process is very important. 

00:20:35
FRANK OCHBERG One thing you can usually do in most communities in America is… is refer to a hospital social service agency or a nurse helpline and let them know that there are people who are skilled in directing family members to sources of support and help. In the PTSD area there are websites, there is gift from within which is 00:21:00]giftfromwithin.org a very good site, very friendly site for people with PTSD and people who wanna support them. And there is a site that is a gateway to several others sites, it’s www.ptsdinfo.org I… I've helped to create that site. And friends and collogues had worked with me on it. It’s a… it's really there for the information seeker. But you know its also important for you as the clinician to get this information yourself so that when someone does ask you, you know what’s available in your community. 

00:21:35
Is there one key suggestion for how I can make myself a more effective PTSD counselor? 

00:21:40
ANGIE PANOS I think the key thing for you as the clinician to know is this is a new field, there is lots of research coming out, things change. It's really important for you to participate in a professional community of other PTSD specialist and learn what you can read and stay up to date in current with the clinical information. 

00:22:05
FRANK OCHBERG Education is part of treating your patients who have PTSD. You probably have gifts as an educator already, but you can get better at it and PTSD is a wonderful thing to teach. It's a… It's easy to teach, it’s… it’s right there in the book, you know what it is, you know what the diagnostic criteria or get it across and get it across in a way so that your audience and the most impos… important member of that audience is your patient, your client understands that PTSD is real. It has affected their mind, it’s not a disorder that is going to like Alzheimer’s disease progress and rob them of reason, it's not like schizophrenia. But it is serious and there is good help for it and you understand how to help them.
