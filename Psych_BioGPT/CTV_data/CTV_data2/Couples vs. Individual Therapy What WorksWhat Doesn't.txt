JEFF So our panel today is about Couples and Individuals Therapy. And our educational objectives for this panel… Louder please. Okay. Ready? Okay. So our panel today is on Couples and Individual Therapy, and couples' therapy requires an understanding of interpersonal dynamics where… and clinic… clinicians need to understand the benefits and liabilities of couples versus individual therapy and have a mechanism for deciding when to use each approach, and we hope our able-panel will be able to edify us. But there will be plenty of opportunities for questions and answers from the audience, uh… questions from the audience because this is a concern that's not easy to answer. Our educational objectives to describe three essential differences between couples and individual treatment. Second educational objective given a couple describe the decision process for couples or individual treatment, and also to list three benefits of couples' therapy. So our panel from your left to right is Sue Diamond Potts, and Ellyn Bader, and Janis Abrahms Spring. I commend you into very good hands. Each of the panelists will have up to 10 minutes to present on the topic, and then we'll have time for interaction with the audience and among the panelists. So you chose Sue to start? Sue will begin. 

00:02:15
SUE DIAMOND POTTS Can you hear me? Yeah. Umm… so I spent a lot of my career as an individual therapist and came to couples' therapy later on. And so it seemed really natural for me to want to do individual work with partners. Uh… Initially, it was more in my comfort zone to do that. As I became more confident as a couples' therapist and saw the benefits uh… and also not just professionally with my work with clients, but also personally because I had been in individual therapy a lot, and then I had also done couples' therapy and the hard painful kind of couples therapy of changing a long term conflict avoidant relationship and was able to see the benefits that partners go through when they witness each other healing family of origin pain and trauma, because it really helps develop a… a deeper sense of empathy for your partner, and uh… also motivates you to not repeat behaviors that reenact or trigger pain and hurting your partner, because you've seen how much they've already been hurt. So there's real benefits to that, and I uh… prefer to work that way now. However, in the center uh… that I started in Vancouver, we specialize in treating couples who are in the aftermath of addiction and early life trauma. So often there are reasons to see people individually. The first uh… example I want to use is a couple who I saw that had been married for two years, and they had a one-year-old, and they were a lovely-looking, very handsome, well put-together couple, but they were a hostile dependant couple who fought all the time. And they were extremely mean to each other, and she was especially triggered uh… by him because of her own trauma background. And she had been removed from her home at the age of 12 by child protection services when a teacher saw the bruises on her body, and in fact, she had been beaten by her mother and stepdad for many years. And it was really hard to work effectively with them because she was so triggered. And when I… I had a double session with her, an individual session with her to try to work on that and was able to help her untangle the danger that she felt in her body from the fact… the past which made her… She had this overactive startle response and was hypervigilant to cues in the environment that signaled that there was danger everywhere, so she was always seeing her husband as the enemy. And so we worked in that session to untangle the trauma, the… the danger of the past from the safety of the present uh… with her, with her husband so that she could actually have a felt sense and experience of what it's like to feel safe, uh… and then could move towards that more and more. And this had a very profound effect on her, and it gave us a lot of traction in the couple's work. But what she did after that session was she uh… went to see her mother and stepfather, and actually, confronted them for the first time on how the abuse had affected her and made it impossible for her to have a secure attachment with her husband in the present. So this was a good example of how I used some individual work with her to get better traction in the couple's work. The other thing I wanted to talk about were addiction clients, because there are variations on the theme of why you'd want to use umm… some individual work with partners who are addicted. Uh… First and foremost, it can be uh… the most efficient way to do it if you want to do an assessment with somebody that you suspect has an addiction, and you meet with them individually. Uh… The other reason is because it takes away… I mean, addicts at their core have the tremendous amount of shame, and they are again hypersensitive to any shaming behaviors that may be happening in the environment and often the spouses or partners of the addict are doing a lot of things that are perpetuating this. So when you meet with them individually, you have… you can control the environment more or you can work on deepening the therapeutic relationship with them, and provide a safe place for them to open up and be honest with you. Umm… The other thing I might want to see them for individually is to confront self-centered behaviors uh… that are interfering with the work we're trying to do. If it's really rigid and it's really stuck, and I want to be able to have again an opportunity one-on-one to provide a compassionate caring environment, but also confrontive of how their behavior is… is slowing down or impeding the work of… in the couples' uh… sessions. Because often addicts don't understand uh… their self… They don't understand the… the self-centered nature, and they think they're giving but they're not giving in ways that are really meaningful to their partner, so they really don't count that much. And then lastly, uh… I wanted to say that sometimes it's important to meet with the spouse uh… of the addict because they may have been reeling from years and years of trauma and abuse, often addiction that goes untreated is much like a person having affair, their affair… their primary symbiotic attachment is to their drug of choice, not to their partner, so there is a third in the relationship and there's a lot of hurt. And so giving that support one-on-one can be helpful. Uh… But again, there may be times when the spouse also needs to be confronted with their own ambivalence in their own way that they undermine the couple's work, and so I'll meet with them uh… where I can uh… have more traction with them in the hopes of then doing better work in… in couples' therapy, because really, I want to do the kind of couples therapy that inspires me which is that we're all collaborating together to look forward to create a brighter future rather than spinning our wheels on the pain of the past. That's it. 

00:08:45
ELLYN BADER You. 

00:08:50

00:08:55
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Uh… Can you hear me? 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN Yeah! 

00:08:55
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING It's okay? Okay, all right. Uh… So I was seeing a couple last week. And uh… the husband had an affair. And the woman he had the affair with tricked him and didn't tell him that she want to get pregnant and was using him to get to have a baby. She got pregnant, and uh… his… the wife found out. And the affair person wants to keep the baby, that's the whole idea. Obviously, this created a huge storm. And umm… I call… I… I was thrown by how remarkably okay, the wife was with this situation that this the husband had had an affair and that there was now this baby that was gonna be produced. Uh… They went along with this, the baby was born. The husband wanted to uh… give this woman some child support for the baby. The wife was consented to this again in kind of a remarkably calm way and bought the baby presents for Christmas. And, you know, the whole thing was bizarre to me. So after 40 years of practice… So I work… The way I work with couples is that or any two people is I have what I call my 'Open Secrets Policy'. The open secrets policy allows me to see them both individually and together. Uh… And for… for me to go after the secrets for them to disclose the secrets, the open secrets policy says, "I will hold your secrets. You tell me your secrets, we work individually. I will not reveal to your partner what your secret is, and your partner gives me permission to do this." It's with their knowledge and consent. Please be careful that you make this very clear, because if you are holding a secret and the partner doesn't know, uh… they will feel more betrayed by you as the therapist than they do by their partner who had the secret. So when people first come in, I tell them, "I have this open secrets policy which means I'll be seeing them individually and together, and that I want them to be able to be 100% honest if they have a secret. I will keep the secret but I keep it openly not secretly, meaning with the permission of the other partner." That's why I call it the open secrets policy. So now I meet with the wife and I'm trying to understand why she loves this baby so much. And she tells me, uh… confidentially that she's been having affairs, and umm… actually affairs she's been having one long term affair with her husband's relative, which of course, he doesn't know about. Uh… And really at one point was very attached to this person and even thought of leaving the marriage, so she could be sympathetic to him. Uh… So this might sound very messed up to you. And uh… but the reality is this is… this is what's happening with this couple. The only question is how much as therapists are we gonna know or how much in the dark are we going to be. And when we're doing therapy in the dark, we're… we're usually not serving anyone. And so it was very important for me to understand that the reason she was so sympathetic is because she was cheating too, and he didn't know about that. And we could talk about what are the advantages and disadvantages of her revealing the secret to him at the time. I'm not gonna push her too and I'm not going to uh… step back from it either. So just briefly with my open secrets policy, when I first started doing therapy in the '70s, I gradually begin to… began to discard three cardinal rules of therapy at the time in order to develop this policy. The first is that uh… we see both partners together. And a lot of you may do… which you consider couples' therapy, but you only meet with one partner, you still see it as couples' therapy. The second cardinal rule that I discarded was that the unfaithful partner must give up the affair person as a prerequisite to my doing couples' therapy with them which was a really stupid rule, because if I required them for pushing them to give up the affair person and they had to decide, were they gonna give me up or the fair person, you know, the expression, "You're cute but you're not that cute." So you know, uh… there was a no-brainer they would dropout of therapy, and I would have to question how I was helping this couple. Uh… So I gave up that rule that that… that it was requirement that the unfaithful partner had to give up the affair person plus that was part of his struggle, and the therapy is making the decision whether they wanna give up the affair person and turn to their partner, or go on with this other person. Uh… If it were so easy, they wouldn't need the therapy. So it seemed like a really dumb rule. The third rule that I discarded was that therapist keep no secrets from their patients. And this also seemed to me to be sort of a dumb unworkable rule, because often all of the juices and the secrets, and if you make a rule that you won't keep a secret, you're just gonna not know the secrets. It's not like there won't be secrets. So you're doing therapy without knowing the secrets. You're doing therapy without knowing the conditions that they're struggling with. And so I gave up that role that the therapist keeps no secrets. And when I first meet with people, I tell them if they have secrets, I want them to be able to tell me the secrets, uh… and both partners understand and agree to the policy that I will know the secrets of the other. So this is very controversial and you may find you hate it, and you may find you like it, you may find you wanna try it. I can only say, "If you're going to try it, you have to start from scratch. You can't switch midstream when you're seeing a couple." From the very first contact, they have to know that you are going to hold their secrets, and they give you permission to do this. So this is how I got the information from this woman when she came in to tell me that she was actually had… had… had affairs over the course of the marriage even with his relatives. And umm… it was part of her understanding his having this affair and having a baby with the affair person, and her willingness to support this uh… this baby. So maybe I'll just stop there. 

00:16:05

00:16:10
ELLYN BADER Umm… So, you know, I think we're talking about umm… that interface between individual and couples therapy, and this is one of the stickiest issues, I think, that all of us face in some ways. Umm… It's sticky because it's easiest when you have some rigid guidelines for yourself. And as soon as you open it up beyond any rigid guidelines, umm… it becomes always a matter of each case, and really having to think about it, and wrestle with yourself, and wrestle with some of the concepts and ideas. And also sometimes, you're up against legal and ethical issues or what your state licensing boards are saying about what's okay and what's not okay, so that also helps to make it even stickier. But you know, a question that I ask myself is when you're seeing a couple, you have an allegiance to the couple, and you also have an allegiance to each of the individuals, and what are you gonna privilege? You know, are you gonna privilege one individual over the other? Are you gonna privilege another individual? Are you gonna privilege the couple? And what I say is if you're… I mean, I believe in trying to hold all three in most cases, not all cases, but in most cases. And to hold all three stretches the therapist. Uh… It stretches you, again like I was saying, 'cause you'll have all kinds of interesting decisions to make. And one of the places that I have umm… challenged therapy now for quite a few years is the problem of actually individual therapists who see people with relationship problems and never ever meet the spouse. Umm… And that is definitely no question that you're privileging the individual relationship. However, so often, once you see somebody individually for any extended period of time, their story will predominate, and you will get to hear primarily umm… lots of awful things usually about their husband or wife or lover. And you don't have a very good window into what it is that they themselves are doing to stir up the mischief. And so I like to say that, and I like to challenge people who do a lot of individual therapy to consider meeting the partner at least one time, either in an individual session or in a joint session. And I had a… a good example just recently of exactly why I believe this. And umm… wife came in to see me individually, and she said… Basically, this is a summary of what she said. She said, "I'm here because I'm lonely. My husband refuses to go out with me. He doesn't want to have a social life with me. He sits at home after works, he watches a lot of television. Umm… He's hanging out in kind of our dark den. It's depressing to be around him. And no matter how hard I try to get him to go out, he just won't go, he's like a big blob." Umm… So she said, "I'm going out mostly with my friends, and my marriage feels pretty empty and pretty lonely." Umm… And you know, I… as I listen to her, I actually had a lot of empathy and compassion for what she was describing. Umm… A week later, he came in alone umm… and this is what he said. He said, "You bet! I am sitting home alone a lot. I've been an alcoholic for 20 years. For years, I wouldn't admit that to myself. Finally, I called a spade a spade. And for the first time in my life, I'm motivated to do something about it. I've been completely sober now for two and a half months for the first time ever. I used to go to bars a lot. I also would play poker with my buddies and drink. I'm finally tired of that lifestyle and I'm committed to creating something better, and I don't want to be tempted yet. TV is a great distraction. My wife likes to go to parties where everyone else is drinking. She likes to go out to dinner with a good bottle of wine, and I'm just not ready for those temptations." Very different picture when I hear his side than if I… I was only working with her and continuing, she never ever mentioned to me that he was alcoholic or that he had just recently become a sober. Wasn't… wasn't even in her framework to tell me. Umm… So that's one of the challenges I think we face as individual therapists. Are we willing to go out on that limb and say, "Hey, we really would like to meet your partner"? Umm… Oops, excuse me. Then there's the problem when you're working with a couple of do you see the individuals? And as Sue and Janis both gave some examples, I think, umm… you have tremendously more leverage when you know, and you have the flexibility to work with the individual partners. And I'm not saying you're doing long term individual therapy, but when you can decide as you go along and you can move in and out of individual sessions and couples' sessions. Umm… And I recently had… I've… I mean, I've always done a lot of that but recently, I did something that I've never done before which was I'd… I have a very a lesbian couple, very hostile, angry couple fighting all the time. And until recently for three months, I saw each of them individually, and I never saw them together. Because after… with the extent of the fighting, nothing was happening in the couple sessions and I used those individual sessions for two things primarily. Well, maybe three. One is to develop an alliance basically and a level of trust with each partner so that I could really confront them on what it is they were doing that was getting in their own way and asking them whether they seriously were in a position to want to start facing some of that and changing it or not. Uh… So that was important. But another thing that's very important often with partners like this is, being able to explain the other one to them. So I spent a lot of time in those sessions, actually umm… describing their partner in a different light than they had ever seen them, and why that light made a lot of sense given the trauma histories or given uh… the background of each of their partners, and why they were misconstruing a lot of what they were reacting to. And now we're back to working as a couple again where a lot of the focus right now is on managing the triggers and being able to be more open and vulnerable with each other in a very… very different way. So I think there is a lot that you can do with that kind of in and out, back and forth between individual and couple sessions. Another place this all comes about is an issue, "What do you do when one person shows up and the other one doesn't show up?" Then it's a really important question of who you privilege. Do you privilege uh… the couple and you only ever see the couple, and then the person who decided not to show up is basically getting to run the show, because they didn't show up? Or do you make it clear that you will… you will work with whoever is there? And then if you're working with whoever's there, you have to be a lot better yourself at managing the boundaries and being skillful about how you manage that back and forth between individual and couple sessions. And the last piece I would say it is the confidentiality piece which Janis mentioned. Uh… And there really are three possibilities that I see and that I use at different times. One is the open secrets which Janis was the first person to have the guts to put out into the field. And I have a lot of respect for her for having the guts to put that out. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:35
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING We hear how many people are (inaudible). 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Oh, that's okay. 

00:24:40
ELLYN BADER But another… You know, so that's one where you're clear with the clients that you will hold secrets. The other… another one is that you are clear that you don't hold secrets, and you… that people better be careful about what they tell you. And then there's a third one which I use in a lot of cases, and again, not always because sometimes, I think Janis' position is better. Umm… But it's the position of the couple decides, and I will explain both positions to them, and then say, "Before I have an individual session with either one of you, I want you guys to talk about it here in front of me. And I want you to make the decision." And I tell them the advantages and disadvantages of all those situations, and then have them make the choice. Uh… That can lead to some tension-filled discussions in the office. But I think that there's a lot to be said for that and it actually can be very growth promoting to push them into thinking that through carefully and making a decision about it. So I think I'll stop there. 

00:25:55
JEFF Well done. So are… are there any interaction among panelists, yeah. Any interaction, okay. Mike problem? Sorry. Is there any interaction among the panelists uh… about the things that you've heard from your other panelists. Sue, do you have something? 

00:26:15
SUE DIAMOND POTTS Uh… I could. Uh… One of the things that uh… I was thinking, Ellyn, as you said, the benefit of helping the partner see their… their other partner in a different light and… and how important that is for us to structure that into the therapy. And I guess it made me think about something I said which was to talk to the uh… addict who… about what it means to truly give in a relationship to put… to start to put themselves in the… in their partner's shoes enough to think that giving isn't just what they think is giving, which is very little, but to think about what it is that their partner would want, what matters to them, and what behaviors are completely unacceptable, and how can they stretch themselves to be better partners for the other person. So I thought that… that was a little bit like what you were saying in a sense. And umm… I know that that's been something that I've learned uh… from you, and that it's made a huge difference in terms of putting those interventions in and helping partners change their view of the other person which tends to be very negative, very constricted. And we can help them see things that… that are there that they just simply can't see. 

00:27:40
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Umm… I'm just thinking about what you said about giving the couple a chance to decide whether they want to be seen individually or together. And it would seem to me that the person who has the secret would want to uh… I don't know, if they would want to be seen together uh… Okay. 

00:28:00
ELLYN BADER I just want to be…. I'm not giving them the choice of whether to be seen together or separately, I'm… I'm saying I do see people separately. But what the terms of that will be I'm asking them to decide. 

00:28:15
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING So they would be seen separately. But where… where would you be with secrets then? 

00:28:20
ELLYN BADER They're making the choice. So if they decide that open secrets is fine, then I'd work with open secrets. If they decide that they want, you know, everything umm… that can be shared, then anything can be shared. 

00:28:35
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Okay. So… But if you're seeing somebody individually, and they have a secret, and they don't want their partner to know the secret, then I… I think it limits the use of the individual session. I mean, the individual session for me is a way to get at the secrets and to understand people on a very profound level and what their life experiences and challenges are. That's one of the… would be the… one of the biggest motivations for me of seeing the person individually is to really get to the guts in the heart of what they're doing and how they're feeling about it. And if they know that I won't keep the secret, then they're going to have a presentation. They're not gonna have an honest revealing of what they're struggling with. And so I… I wouldn't… I wouldn't think that… that would work against why I'd see them individually. 

00:29:30
ELLYN BADER So umm… one good example, umm… and this is ways back but was with a particular man who knew umm… that I wasn't going to keep secrets umm… and told me about what we would call a sexual addictive pattern where umm… he traveled a lot for business and every time he went on business, he was having umm… one-night stands with women and he'd had a lot of one-night stands, it felt compulsive, it felt like he couldn't stop. And I kept that secret a short while… while… But while what the… the… the individual sessions were designed for was to help prepare him to go into a significant treatment program, and to be ready to tell his wife, and be ready for the repercussions of that. And so I was able to use that in that way to help move that forward. 

00:30:25
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Okay. 

00:30:30
JEFF Okay, good? 

00:30:30
SUE DIAMOND POTTS Are you going to… Hang on. Umm… I'm wondering on the same topic. If the trouble I've run into and in giving the couple the choice is that, either they're really merged and they'll just say what's the easiest when they don't really mean it, umm… or the person who maybe doesn't want to have it open is afraid to say they don't want to have it open, because it will expose the fact that they want to be able to have secrets. So I… Just wondering if you could comment on that. 

00:31:10
ELLYN BADER Umm… Well, first of all, like I said, it's a very complicated issue. It's not a simple issue. And umm… there are a few couples where I haven't given them the choice, but also with the… the ones that you're talking about who are very merged, umm… I'm probably gonna have to do a lot of work with them to deal with their low levels of differentiation with the merger and all of that, and that's going to be as important as whatever the secret is or to allow… you know, or somebody being able to maintain a secret for a longer period of time. 

00:31:40
SUE DIAMOND POTTS So a lot of work. In other words, there's a lot of work that goes into helping them make that decision in a meaningful way, right? 

00:31:50
ELLYN BADER Yeah. 

00:31:50
JEFF Shall we see what questions we have from the audience? 

00:31:50
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Okay. 

00:31:50
JEFF Do you want more interaction? 

00:31:55
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I could say one more… Do you want me to say one… one more thing? Umm… So umm… to me, I like seeing both people individually and together. I find I get more information. I get the truth. umm… I feel more in control. Okay, that's who I am. Umm… It may not be good for the patient, but it's good for me. So right. Uh… So, you know, I'm thinking of this couple where umm… the wife had an affair and uh… with the guy's best friend, and when he learned of it, obviously, the marriage blew apart, and they began working on trying to rebuild the marriage. And the… the truth is she loved him, they had a wonderful family, she was remorseful. And so we were doing this work together. Umm… In an individual session, I brought her in individually. And I said to her uh… You know, I'm thinking, why now after 12 years of marriage, did she have an affair? Why now? So I pressed her. You can't hear? Okay. Can you hear now? Okay. So I said… I kept pressing her, why now… why now? Uh… Maybe, this isn't the first affair. And again, I'm reminding her, it's an open secrets policy, I will not disclose to her husband without her permission the truth. I will not require her to disclose to the husband. I have the permission of the husband for her to be honest with me. Pressing… pressing… pressing… pressing finally, she said to me, "Okay, okay, it's not the first affair, okay!" Okay. So "Okay, thank you… thank you. What's… what's the story?" "Okay. So my mother died six years ago and I had an affair with the oncologist. Uh… And it went on for about eight months. And umm… it was a very significant relationship for me." "Okay, all right, thank you." So if I don't know the truth, then as a therapist, I it's like putting pieces of the puzzle together without all the pieces. Why after 12 years of marriage did she have an affair? Well, first of all, it's not even true. You know, I'm looking at what happened in their lives so that they had… she had an affair. That's not the story. So uh… it just seems to me, it limits my ability to help them. Uh… So she gave me the truth, and we began looking at, you know, were there other affairs? Why at that age, did she have an affair? What was going on with her, with him, with the marriage and so on? Uh… Separate from whether the husband ever knew, she had to know why she had this affair. And I, as the therapist, had to help her plug and address her vulnerabilities. And if we, as therapists, don't even know the truth, we're not going to be helping patients to the same degree. So that's why to me, this is so very important. So it's gonna make you feel very uncomfortable if you don't do this kind of work. And it may not be for you… It may not be for you. So now I'm meeting with the couple and you know, we've done some work, and he says to her, "Okay, look, you have hurt me more than anyone in my life, and I love you more than anyone in my life. And affair is over. If you ever do this to me again, I'm not doing couples' therapy. I'm hiring an attorney. So that's it. One affair, that's all I can stomach." And then it was like a light bulb that went off in his head, and he said to her, "And this is the only affair you've ever had, is that right… Is that right?" And she looked at me, and she looked at him, and he looked at me, and he looked at her. And she said, "That's right." And he looked at her, and he said, "You swear on the lives of her children, this is the one and only affair?" And she looked at me, and I looked at her, and he looked at me. And she said, "I swear on the lives of our children, this is my one and only affair." So I gave this talk at a psychoanalytic conference, and people were jumping up and screaming. And… and they said, "And what about the counter transference… What about the counter transference?" I said, "Well, what about the counter transference?" They said, "Well, how did you feel… How did you feel being so inauthentic knowing that this woman's lying." I'll tell you how I felt, comfortable. I felt comfortable. Because I knew that I was gonna deal with this woman in trying to excavate what happened then so that she could really love up to her promise to be faithful for the rest of her life as long as she was gonna be in this marriage. I would feel a lot more uncomfortable if I didn't know the truth. So I hold it out to you. I know it's radical. I know a lot of if you will gag on this, but some of you may wanna try it. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:20
JEFF What else? Okay, so let's see… let's see what questions we have from the audience. But maybe I can prompt while we're waiting for the audience to… Okay, we have a mike and a question. And somebody else? So we now prepared here for the next question. Okay. Sir? Please. We have mike working. Nate! 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN It works, good. I can't… So my question as… as it's a lot to absorb thinking about this open secret policy and that's… that's fine. I'm not quite convinced that I actually need to know everything in the objective world uh… for couples as opposed to what's going on in the room. But my question is more logistic wise and how you take notes, keep notes 'cause couples contentious might divorces, might subpoena records, (inaudible) that kind of thing. 

00:38:15
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Right. When… when they come in, they sign a form that says that you can't do therapy, and be vulnerable and open, and also feel threatened that the information is going to be used against you. And so they sign a paper that's probably has no legal value that says they totally give up any rights to the file. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:38:40
JEFF Okay. So please. Uh… We have microphone over here, just to take a second. Wait. No it's okay. Don't, just speak and the audiotape will take care of making sure that you're heard. 

00:39:00
SUE DIAMOND POTTS It's not turned on. 

00:39:00
JEFF It's okay. No. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN I can turn on my voice. All right. 

00:39:05
JEFF No need. 

00:39:05
SUE DIAMOND POTTS It has to be turned on? 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN What if uh… if you learn that something really unethical going to happen, not to the level of reporting? For example, if someone says that they're going to kidnap the… the child and take it out of the country, you probably need to report (inaudible) right now. 

00:39:25
JEFF What are… The question is… 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN But if someone is saying… if someone is saying that I'm siphoning money from (inaudible) 'cause I want to divorce, but I'm going to not disclose it until I'm safely enough. 

00:39:35
JEFF Let me repeat so that we're sure that everybody understands. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:39:40
JEFF So if there is an ethical infraction like, somebody is explaining that they're siphoning money or somebody who's threatening, kidnap their children, what are the limits of the open secrets policy, and how are they… how are they explained to the couple? 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN Well, I believe… Good. I believe that some of it… When it's reportable, it's pretty clear limits. But if it's not reportable, but you feel that that's very… very unethical, that's my question. 

00:40:05
JEFF Great. Okay. 

00:40:10
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I think you have to qualify it. When you… when you present the… the policy, you can say, if there is a threat to human life, for example, umm… I'm not allowed to keep a secret. So you're telling them what secrets you'll keep and what you won't. And if they tell you something where you can't keep it a secret, they know that in advance before they tell you the secret. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN It's siphoning money issue. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Some of it. 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Like, something really clearly unethical, it's not illegal (inaudible) to report. 

00:40:45
JEFF Something unethical that's not a legal responsibility. 

00:40:50
ELLYN BADER I mean, I can tell you, it's a real situation that I dealt with, and I haven't had many, like you're describing. But umm…I did have one with a woman who is committing a kind of insurance fraud. Not on a very big level, but on a level where she would travel and report her luggage lost when it really wasn't and then filed to get all the money back. Uh… You know, that the airlines would pay for the lost luggage. Uh… And so I did tell her, "This is… this is a secret that I'm not willing to hold. And it is affecting your husband if you are caught. And I do want you to come into a joint session and talk to him about what you've been doing, and then two of you figure out what you're gonna do about it together." 

00:41:40
JEFF Super. Okay. Question from here. And wait… wait for the microphone… Speak. Stand up. Say, hello. What's you name? 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:41:55
JEFF Hello, okay. Where? Just keep speaking, and he'll catch up to you if you keep speaking. 

00:42:00
SUE DIAMOND POTTS There's a lot off switch. 

00:42:00
JEFF Question for Janis. It's okay. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Uh… Two years ago at the same conference, after listening to your presentation, I started doing open secret policy with my couples. And I experienced all the benefits of it as you were describing, but here's my ethical dilemma. What if an information disclosed to me which I agreed to keep confidential makes me believe as a clinician that our therapy, couples' therapy is inefficient because of that secret. So I'm not disclosing it, I'm encouraging my client to talk about it to her husband or her… his wife, they're not willing to do it. But as I go to couples' session knowing what I know, I believe that the work we're doing is not gonna go anywhere. And I feel that at this point, if this person is not willing to disclose, I'm… I don't wanna work with them anymore. I don't believe in my work with them. How do I deal with that? How do I explain to the other spouse that has no idea what's going on why I'm terminating or referring them or having difficulties in working with them? 

00:43:10
JEFF Okay, speak. 

00:43:15
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Uh… Well, I… I think that we have the right as a therapist to be authentic and perhaps that authenticity is the most important gift we could give to the patient and to say, if… if you were in that situation, that I don't believe that I'm being helpful to you without necessarily explaining. Uh… I'm not feeling effective, I don't believe I'm being helpful to you. And uh… I'm… I'm going to withdraw from the case. 

00:43:50
JEFF Super, sir. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Yes. Umm… This is for Janis. I am having a difficulty wrapping my mind around the fact that the gentleman uh… who came and… the husband who had committed infidelity came in for… 

00:44:05
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING That the wife committed infidelity, okay. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Well, he was the one who fathered a child, right. 

00:44:15
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Okay, there were two different cases. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I've got it… I've got it, yeah. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Oh, I'm sorry. I was just gonna… So anyhow… Okay. Uh… There was an element of deception, therefore, on his part. 

00:44:25
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Right. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN So even though it started as a couples' therapy, I'm having a difficulty distinguishing that from what it seems that it has turned into an individual therapy because one of the partners is left in the dark as far as deceptive nature of how the case turned into, because there's a big portion of it that is crucial for the person who first committed the adultery is now under… functioning under the assumption that the therapy began because of his infidelity. 

00:44:55
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Right. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN So now, you know, there's a big part of this that has to do with us as a self of therapists and our own values, you know. We're sitting there across from… from a person and another human being who is completely left in the dark, and he's under… again functioning under the presumption of "Yes, I screwed up." And here it is, an opportunity for the wife who is in fact deceiving. He came out clean in a sense, right. He's in there in therapy because of him in essence. Through our own probing, we all of a sudden find out that she, in fact, is really deceiving, continuing the deception. 

00:45:45
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Right. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN So what is our role there as a self of therapist? Is it just to us to kind of find out things for working as individual therapy? If that is the case, then the husband needs to know that I would think, please correct me if I'm wrong. Excuse my (inaudible). 

00:46:00
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Yeah. No, absolutely, it's not a correction. This is… These are such individual issues for us, as therapists, to decide what… how we're going to conduct therapy, their options that give us uh… different levels of information. And uh… you know, we each have to make a decision what our policy is gonna be? What feels most comfortable? What makes us feel more… most effective? And that's why you're hear of these conferences. Maybe you'll go away with something a little new, something you'll try. Maybe you go away thinking, "The way I'm doing it right now works for me, and I'm not going to change." But uh… you will have prodded at that a little bit. So that's… that's… that's what's so great. In the end, uh… whether… whether you have one policy or the other, the truth is that this woman had a secret that she was not going to reveal to the husband. And that happened in their past. And uh… whether you uh… don't have an open secrets policy in which case you don't, as a therapist, even know the truth yourself, or you have the open secrets policy where you know the truth, and she may decide that she's not going to tell him the truth. Uh… You have to decide which of those positions works for you and makes you feel most effective. 

00:47:20
ELLYN BADER One thing I like about your question, and I don't know if you can take a little farther, Janis, but is, uh… you know, are you meeting with her several times more than once, and then how are you positioning yourself (inaudible) her in any future individual sessions? 

00:47:35
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING There's no format to this for me. I meet with both partners often. I mean, if there's a format, I'll meet with both of them individually one week and then together the following week. So if I meet with one individually, I'd like to meet with both of them individually, and then I meet with them both together. 

00:47:55
ELLYN BADER It's okay… 

00:48:00
UNKNOWN My question is… 

00:48:00
SUE DIAMOND POTTS Hang on. 

00:48:00
JEFF I would take a question myself. And when would you go up a level? When would you transfer from a couples' situation to a family therapy situation? Why would you just stay with the couple and why not bring in the family? And what would be the conditions upon which you would do family therapy rather than couples or individual therapy? 

00:48:25
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Yeah. Most of the people who come to see me are having marital problems, and I'm not saying that doesn't involve the children. Uh… So umm… I don't know, I think each of us has a way of working where we feel most effective. Uh… And to me, having two people in the room where there are secrets and there's so much chaos and so much emotional intensity is probably as much as I can manage personally, and I'm… I probably wouldn't bring in the children. But for other people, they might find it essential to bring in the whole family. 

00:49:10
ELLYN BADER Well, Jeff I love your question that could be a whole semester course easily. Uh… But a few guidelines like when I umm…see a couple for example who are separating and there were children at home, and I work with them on how they're going to tell their children and what's involved in that, and then if the children are old enough, I do ask for sessions with the children. Umm… And there's times, you know, when there's intergenerational conflicts with parents where I bring in the parents and so I think that's again, all that flexibility of the system and the greater system and what you will involve. 

00:49:55
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Right. But that wasn't the question. And what if you're talking about dealing with the partners and their infidelity, it's different than talking about issues that relate to… or directly to the children which case, if there is an adult child, and there's an affair, and the child finds out or sees the father watching porn or something, I would very much bring in the child… the child… the adult child with the parent. But this question had to do more with uh… secrets that existed between the partners. 

00:50:30
SUE DIAMOND POTTS I think, you know, in response to what you're saying and I think the idea that people have choice in and it's clear that we know we can decide on our own what are we comfortable with in terms of work. 'Cause if we're working with couples and we see them at all individually, we have to have an idea of what our policy is? What are we comfortable with? And I've talked to lots of therapists who have told me straight out that they are not comfortable with the open secrets policy. I am, but they're not. Because they're afraid that if… Some… If one partner told them something in a session that they can't trust themselves to not, in any way, say something that would lead part of that out. And so they know that about themselves, and they're comfortable with that. And so they design their therapy according to what they're comfortable with. I don't think it's about what's right and what's wrong. Uh… When Carol Gilligan wrote her book on moral reasoning from a female… from a woman's perspective called 'Caring', she, you know, added this dimension of complexity to our behavior to our decision making about what… what… what do we do that we feel is the most caring way to be. And I think we can apply that here in this situation so that each of us gets to say, "How can I be the most effective? What am I comfortable with when I'm seeing couples, and I'm gonna have to talk to each of them separately at some point? What's my policy? What do I wanna do about that? Do I wanna make it confidential in those individual sessions? Do I wanna share it openly? What am I comfortable with?" And then, like Ellyn said, she she… umm… What's the word… You decide, right, what… what you're comfortable with. It's not even one way or the other, she's gonna decide depending on the couple. So she can vary it. Umm… I think it's just important to see, we all have a choice to make here, it's not one right… one… one right way or one wrong way. 

00:52:35
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I'm just thinking this week, for example, a couple of examples of secrets that one partner would tell me that I wouldn't have access to without the individual sessions. One was where the other man had had… the husband had an affair. And in an individual, he said, "You know, what my wife is not telling you is that she is addicted to pain medication, and it has (inaudible), and she uh… is very sensitive to this. And I… she doesn't want me to bring this up, and I don't know how to handle this." So it's just… It's important a sort of piece to the puzzle. Uh… And another example, I'm thinking, where this couple, after an affair, they're back together again uh… after the husband had an affair. But the wife is not having sex with him. And an individual, she said to me, "Look, I don't know how to tell him this, but he doesn't wash. And I don't want to be near him intimately. And, you know, after his having an affair, I'm so afraid he's gonna lose me… leave me anyway. Uh… But may… maybe you could help me figure out how I'm going to say this, but I don't enjoy sex with him." So the individual sessions give you a chance to have an intimate glimpse into the individuals who may be struggling and want to give you information that's really critical for you to help them in the couples' session that they would… will not uh… reveal in front of their partner. So you have to ask, is it better not to know or to know. And then when you know, you know, having its complicated when you know. There are… That makes it complicated, but you have to decide if it's worth it for you. uh… in the end. 

00:54:25
SUE DIAMOND POTTS And we're not… We're not… we're not seeing them in individual therapy only to hear secrets. There are other reasons why we would choose to see a partner or both partners individually, right? 

00:54:35
ELLYN BADER Definitely, yes, definitely. 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN My question… Oh. 

00:54:40
JEFF We have time for two more questions. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Right. I think you act not legally but ethically… 

00:54:50
SUE DIAMOND POTTS Who's speaking? 

00:54:50
ELLYN BADER Yeah, who's talking? 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Not legally but ethically, you might… you might hear something that the children are going to see or hear that you'd want to… For instance, what if one of the partners was having, not only having sex, but the children were seeing it, and are being aware of something. And now as a child advocate, you're thinking, "Okay, between the husband and the wife, I've told them I wouldn't say anything." But if you're gonna follow that policy, I think you probably say, "But if I think it's going to affect the children, then I would say something." And then at what point would I do that? 

00:55:35
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I'm sorry, I didn't follow that. I'm sorry. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN Okay. You're not gonna say anything to the husband about what you find out about the wife or vice versa. 

00:55:45
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING The wife tells you a secret, and you're not gonna tell the husband. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Right, the secret. But I'm asking you, as a child advocate, what if you felt that, not legally but ethically, something comes up that will greatly affect a children… children… a child or children. At what point would you then break that rule and say, " I'm not protecting the husband and wife, but I do want to say something because it's going to affect the child"? 

00:56:15
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Well, personally, I… I tell people that if there's a threat to human life, if there is any federal law that's broken, I can't keep a secret. I tell them that in advance, so they know, if they tell me something, I won't keep the secret. I wanna qualify that in the beginning. But then there are a lot of things you hear that will affect a lot of people. And the truth is, uh… your… unless you cordon that off in some way, you know, you're agreeing to keep the secret, and you believe that, by knowing the secret and working with them on it, in the end, you will help that person more than if you were in the dark. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

00:56:50
JEFF One more quick question. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN I have one question for Janis where it's referring to the example you talked about with the woman who swore on the life of her kids. When the guy looked at you, and looked at her, and looked at you, if he were to have asked you, "Did she have other affairs? Do you know of other affairs?" How would you have handled that question? 

00:57:10
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Yeah. People understand the open secrets policy, and they're not going to say to me, "So if you have a secret, would you tell me?" Because they understand they both have given me permission to hold… hold the secrets. I feel comfortable. It's been 40 years I've been working this way. I feel comfortable holding the secrets, because my work with her is going to help her be faithful to him. And if I didn't understand the truth, I would be less effective to her and to him, and to the family. So personally, I feel comfortable with it. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN I understand. You feel comfortable, but I… And I would imagine, they understand that secrets are gonna be held. But in the heat of that experience, he may have turned to you to say, "Did she? Do you know if she did?" And I'm wondering how you respond to that without obviously giving anything away. 

00:58:05
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I just say, "You know how the open secrets policy works. And if either one of you has told me a secret, I hold the secret." 

00:58:15
JEFF Okay. Well, can we have a way of… of thanking the panel if you have other questions, come on up.
