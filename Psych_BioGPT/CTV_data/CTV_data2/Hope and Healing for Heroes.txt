UNKNOWN The events on September 11th were unusual because, uh, so many firefighters and rescue workers, police officers, felt their feelings overflowing at times because it was so enormous. 

00:00:33
UNKNOWN This tragedy doesn't allow for denial. It doesn't allow people to say, "Oh, this won't have an affect." In fact, what's the first thing we heard most people saying after this event happened? This changes everything. We will never be the same again. 

00:00:53
UNKNOWN Ellen Goodman wrote a really wonderful column in which she said, and started talking about how do you talk to your children? And what she said was talk to them about the heroes.

KAREN W. SAAKVITNE, PH.D. Talk to them about the heroic heroes who wanted to help and what they did. That's what you want your children to take away from an event like this...that so many people had some responded, and responded out of love and altruism, and not out of retaliatory rage and also, not out of despair. I think that's certainly the goal or terrorism...is to create despair... and hope is our only weapon against despair. When the unthinkable happens, we have to rework our belief systems, but they are sturdy. They're resilient. Where I come to in that process is that I come back to my fundamental beliefs; that there is more good than evil in the world and that there is more good in people...than there is violence and a wish to harm, and that doesn't come from a place of denial. I know a lot, actually about people's capacity to harm one another and people's capacity for violence, but because I work in the field of helping people heal from the impact of interpersonal violence, I also feel I have the tremendous honor to see the capacity for resilience, the capacity for love, the capacity for goodness and altruism. Both in people who have been harmed and in people who have, in the past, done harm, and I think those stories of heroism in the, the face of the tragedy are part of what reinforce that and remind me that in fact, while there was a terrible loss of life and a terrible, um, therefore bereavement...there were tens of thousands of people responding with loving kindness and responding with determination to reclaim life and the value of life and the value of love... and the importance of working for a place of love rather than a place of hate, and working for a place of trying to make the world better, and not trying to destroy... what was wrong with it.

ANNE C. PRATT, PH.D. Early on, while it's still going on, it's actually, um, it's actually important for them to be very numb and shut down and anyone whose done that sort of work will tell you that, that they, uh, really try to keep their feelings at bay while they do the work because in the face of such horror, of all that you can do is, is try not to feel it, but over time, I think, um, you know, it's in some ways it's, it's the same thing the rest of us need to do. You need to find people who will listen and share some of those experiences. Often people who have been through something as horrific as that are unwilling to share their experiences with their loved ones or with anyone, even people who ask. Partly because they f-, they know how... dreadful and how damaging it is to hold those experiences; to carry that imagery, to know what they know, and they don't wanna inflict that on anyone else. Sometimes when they've tried to talk to somebody else about this, even people who say they want to hear, the response that they get is, um, people listening avidly for a short time and then they find listeners changing the subject or their eyes wandering, or saying, "Wow, that was really bad, I'm, gotta go now." Um, tha-, it's very hard to be a good listener, uh, to someone who has undergone something awful. Even though it's my field and I'm trained in it, I have to watch myself sometimes when the, uh, listening gets tough. I have to silence my urge to change the subject or to pick up on a side tangent and start responding to that. It's very difficult to, uh, to listen to someone whose gone through something like that. So, I guess what I would urge rescue workers to do is to...spend time with each other and to pay attention to their own and each other's need to talk about it. Often the, uh, the American urge to put it past one and get past it, um, seems to be teaching people to, uh, just process it for a day or two, or attend the parade, or see the flowers, um, taking the donations, thank everybody, make a speech and then get on with your life. Put it past you, and I would, I would urge rescue workers to know that it takes longer. It takes longer than...probably anybody wants to know and th-, they need, they need to reach out and if they can't find good listeners among friends or family, to, uh, seek out clergy people or, um, mental health professionals trained in treatment of trauma or disaster relief work. Um, people who really will take the time to listen. I am heartened by the public's response to these workers so far, and I think that we have an opportunity to help people understand trauma a little better. If we're willing to stop and think about it, w-, we can imagine that, uh, someone who's having nightmares or who can't even go to sleep a week or three weeks after they were involved in something like this is not gonna be fine two months afterward, and that more talking, more sharing of feelings... more sharing the burden lightening our burdens a little bit by letting someone else carry a little bit of it. More of that is gonna be needed. It's not over quickly.

DANIEL J. ABRAHAMSON, PH.D. Healing takes time. None of us knows, the ac-, the exact time frame for healing, but we are understanding that for people who have experienced severely traumatizing events that often times we're talking years, not months. If they have past vulnerabilities, previous losses, previous trauma, that it's really important for them to recognize that they're more vulnerable and to reach out and get help, and that's doubly important for the people with a previous history of trauma or loss, but it's also true for everybody. We know there's good, hard science research to show that when people talk about things that are upsetting, they develop less problems as a result of that. They become sick less often. Their immune system is strengthened. That, that it's actually...it promotes healthy functioning if you talk about what's bothering you, on both a physical and emotional level, and of course the physical and emotional, you know, coincide very closely when you're talking about how people react to a trauma. Talking matters, and it doesn't matter whether you talk to family members, friends; if you're involved in a church or a synagogue, or some other kind of social group or religious group, it's really important to use those connections, to use those resources that are part of your life. Um, they're there. That's what they're there for: to give, to add meaning and strength and depth to your life. Don't turn away from them right now. People who experience trauma tend to feel very isolated, they tend to feel like nobody else is feeling what I'm feeling right now and that's an, a f-, that's a f-, makes pe-, these people feel very alone and very isolated and it's so important for somebody and this is, this is also important for, for the loved ones uh, an-, and friends of people who have been through serious trauma, ya know, and thi-, and, and there's so many people in this kind of incident. Who are those people everywhere have been affected by this and the communities that have been affected. It's really important for those people to get together, to come together to reach out if you know somebody who was affected by this and they're isolated, reach out to them. The isolation is probably your worst enemy i-, in, in responding and coping with this. On the other hand, if somebody needs some space in order to heal, if they say, "Geez, I really appreciate your lending a hand, but right now I need to deal with this myself," it's, it's important to respect that too. Um, don't impose yourself on people, but reach out to people, and don't just reach out a week after, two weeks after, or a month after, six months from now, a year from now, check in with folks that you know were affected and say, "How are you doing?" One of the most important memorials or tributes that we can pay to all of the people who died and all of the, the firefighters and police and emergency personnel who gave up their lives trying to save others, I think the, the, the greatest memorial that we can offer to them as a society is to pay more attention to people's psychological and emotional well being as an important component of American life.

LAURIE ANNE PEARLMAN, PH.D. Many of those people are probably going to have a hard time for some time to come and many of those people may decide that they may need to seek some sort of medical assistance, and, uh, I, I certainly think that they can benefit from talking about what happened, trying to connect with other people who experienced something similar, trying to learn from people who have had other traumatic experiences in the past, who may be further along in the healing process, and some of them may need to have a professional person to talk to; a place where they can really look in detail, talk in detail about what happened, what they experienced, build their internal abilities to cope and try to address some of the specific meanings and difficulties they may be experiencing. Traumatic experiences are fundamentally about a disruption of meaning and spirituality, and so people will need to either create or recreate a spiritual path for themselves to find their way. Spirituality can mean different things to different people. For some people it's about organized religion and God, for other people it's about nature or a connection with humanity, or giving to others. Those kinds of experiences can help enormously with healing. Hope involves being able to take in the realities of the world and maintain a sense of future and possibility. I don't think we need tragedy for that, but we do need commitment, and, um, commitment is not easy to come by. Tragedy makes hope a necessity... uh, but I think there is a possibility of living a life committed to hope.

00:13:03
REV. DR. FREDERICK J. STREETS For me, hope is not something that ignores reality. Hope very much so looks at reality, but it gives a person the capacity to imagine how things can be different and to work towards, uh, making those things happen, and to the extent that they do, as we all feel satisfied of course, but to the extent that they don't, that does not destroy hope. It only helps us to, to reevaluate and to be more open and more imaginative to what we could do. This is, this is how people a-, around the world and throughout history have survived, and it's how my ancestors and, and my parents ge-, more immediate generation survived, uh, racism in this country. To be hopeful is not fancif-, fanciful thinking. It's not ignoring reality. It's looking reality in the face, but yet still having the capacity to dig deep down within one's soul and one's psyche, to imagine how things can be and to work towards that, but it also means hope means having a view of the self that is empowered and not a view of the self as a victim. A person whose experiences this horrible loss, it would be very easy and understandable for them to just give up on, the-, their own, their own like of themselves and give up on human beings; not to trust anybody, not to trust the government anymore, not to trust, uh, be-, living in an open Democratic society, and wha-, that's understandable, but I would encourage the person to give themselves time for the kind of, uh, recuperative, uh, uh, nature, like the-, that will go on again, without saying to them that they should be over this in a year's time or 20 years. It's, it's a matter of integrating this experience and growing from it in such a way that enables them to still move forward and try to create a meaningful life.

KERRY PATRIC CLARK I see the images on television, and I see these men and women comin' off this front line or this Ground Zero or whatever we're calling it now, and I wanna be one of those people. I wanna go lift some iron, and I wanna find somebody and, and, uh, put, help people with closure or, uh, help with the healing. We're gonna reach the bottom... say, we're gonna dig deep. The whole world is watchin', nobody sleeps. Sheer determination... block by block...ain't nobody dyin', not on this watch. I see it in their faces, in the tears and the sweat, and if the dust ever settles, I know we'll never forget...Ground Zero. God bless this land. Ground Zero, and as one we stand. As I look, uh, at my life, I, uh, I'm not that guy. I'm not a guy that goes and lifts iron. My gift is music. Okay, how can I use that gift to do the same thing? To lift some weight off people that these, the events of 911 have created this incredible weight and this fear which, I think, is a mental weight. So hard to remember...a flag half high, a moment of silence, an eye for an eye. It's playin' on the faces, over and over again. We lost somethin' back there...where we all have been. Ground Zero. Ground Zero.

REV. DR. FREDERICK J. STREETS There will be a natural gap, uh, created between people's experience who escaped the trade towers, those who lost loved ones, uh, and, and those who were blocks away or miles away, or a continent away. I-, the analogy is kind of like in real estate; location, location, location. Those most close to the experience will spend a lifetime, uh, adjusting and integrating it, uh, differently than those who were mos-, uh, who were most furthest away. The conc-, concern we have about that is that those who are, who are further away from the experience will begin to discount the experience of those who were closest to it, not being an opening, listening, caring society for those who were directly affected and to learn more from that experience has been all about. So, I hope that that gap does not get created as broadly or as widely as, as it could happen. This is an opportunity for us to bridge, uh, uh, so much that will help us to be a better nation and a better people, and if we, if we segment ourselves from one another as we have in the past, we will lose that opportunity.
