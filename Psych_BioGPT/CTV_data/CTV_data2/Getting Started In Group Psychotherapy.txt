00:00:00
GRAEME MCGRATH  Getting started in group analytic psychotherapy can be a pretty daunting prospect. Say you wanted to start a group, what kind of problems might arise? I mean, how does a group get started in the first place? What if a member of the group asked for some particular help or advice from you directly? What if somebody starts bending the rules like arriving late all the time? What if somebody is very distressed or perhaps even suicidal? Should you take charge or should you allow the group to deal with it? Well these and other questions are ones that we deal within this videotape. What we've done is we've set up a group with a conductor and six other group members. 

00:01:15
GRAEME MCGRATH  Before the first session takes place, the group begins by selecting out people who have appropriate problems for dealing within a group, that's people with relationship problems. It's also important to select people who will get on well together in a group, and to have one or two preparatory interviews with each beforehand. The people that we're going to see in this group have already gone through that process. Chris is a psychology student. She lives alone, is divorced, and has no children. She is unable to self-sustain relationships, getting involved with people who are unable or unwilling to meet her real needs. Under a friendly and capable visage, she feels as though life has no point and she is angry and disillusioned. Maggie is a teacher in a primary school. She has recurrent attacks of depression and is also chronically anxious. She has had a number of close relationships, and has begun to realize that she falls into a pattern of taking over friend's lives until they feel suffocated. This seems to be related to her own intense and unacknowledged need to be helpless and dependent. When anxious, she talks too much. Mary is a housewife who worked for two years as a secretary before getting married early. Her children are now independent and she feels increasingly dissatisfied. During the assessment interview, she recognized her own ambivalence about wanting something different and more fulfilling for herself but clinging to the safety of the life she knows well. She has difficulty asserting her own needs, tending to mother others. Peter is an accountant. He sees his problems as being related to his difficulty expressing his true feelings. His mother was repeatedly ill during his early life and he was forced to be self-contained and independent. He hopes that the group will allow him to make really close relationships for the first time in his life. Mike is single and a computer programmer. He is an only child who has very ambivalent feelings about his parents, experiencing them as cold and withholding, but nevertheless seeing them regularly, trying to get them interested in his daily life. When his facade of independence and emotional self-containment is threatened, he responds with anger and withdrawal. Andrew is 46 and older than the others in the group. He is a financial advisor and married with two children. During his contact before entering the group, he talked of his chronic anxiety, fear of failure, and his sense of personal dissatisfaction and lack of purpose. He believes he is un, unable to have real human feelings and wishes he could cry, something he has not done since boyhood. He appreciates that by normal standards, he has a successful marriage and family life, and a good career. But he's unable to accept this deep down inside. The conductor, Dr. Jones Smith, is a psychiatrist with an interesting group psychotherapy. 

00:04:20
1. Beginning the first group 

00:04:20
GRAEME MCGRATH  Each set of vignettes we're about to show have the same group of people sharing the same problems that typically arise in groups, but dealing with them in different ways. To some extent, these are caricatures of normal group processes, and that they occur much more rapidly than the evolution of a group would be expected to do. So let's look at the first time this group meets, and the way things that might turn out if the conductor takes different styles of(ph) beginning the group. 

00:04:50
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well, I'm glad to see you could all make it tonight. Ah, all that is except ah, Mike. I put a chair out for him, but unfortunately he's got pharyngitis, so he, he couldn't be here this evening. But ah, he sent me a message and he's hopeful that he'd be here next, next time. I think I've, ah, met you all, and ah, told you something about the group. So, I won't go with that again this evening. Uhm, but I do just want to tell you that if for some reason you're not be able to make your group, uhm, or you're gonna be late, do let me know if you haven't been able to tell the group beforehand so that(ph) I can pass the message on. 

00:05:30
 Hmm. 

00:05:30
DR. JOHN SMITH And you can always ring my secretary up to about five o'clock on this day and leave a message for me, and I'll get it to the group. I've never been quite sure whether saying what I think is gonna happen in groups is helpful. Ah, so, I'm not gonna say very much about that tonight, but I do want to say that what happens in the group is not gonna be determined by me. It's just, I mean, it's up for, to everybody to use the group in whatever way they, they want to. 

00:06:10
[sil.] 

00:06:10
ANDREW  No one else is speaking, I'll, I'll make a start. I'll introduce myself. My name's Andrew. I'm a financial adviser and I'm here to beat my drinking problem. 

00:06:20
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well I'm John as most of you know already. 

00:06:25
MAGGIE Ah, I'm Margaret, most people call me Maggie. 

00:06:30
PETER I'm Peter. 

00:06:30
MARY  I'm Mary and, and I'm a housewife. 

00:06:35
CHRISTINE Hmm. And I'm Christine, I'm a psychology student. 

00:06:40
MARY  I don't know if anybody's been in a group like this before. I know I haven't. I was wondering what it was gonna be like when I came along tonight. I hope it's not gonna be like some of those groups on the television. 

00:07:00
ANDREW The most sort of thing, you mean confessional... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
 Hmm. 

00:07:00
ANDREW ...sort of thing? 

00:07:00
MARY Well, I didn't mean that so much and I don't think I mind that. But, what really upsets me is when people shout at each other. And I know in the groups that I saw, the doctors just seem to be aching(ph) them all. He wasn't controlling it at all and people were almost hitting each other. 

00:07:15
DR. JOHN SMITH  And how, any other people in the group are afraid I'm gonna wake(ph) them up? 

00:07:20
CHRISTINE  Perhaps, we'll aching you on. 

00:07:25
 Uh hmm, perhaps. 

00:07:25
PETER I bet you will. 

00:07:30
GRAEME MCGRATH So perhaps we could talk about the first thing you have done. 

00:07:35
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. Well, being the first session, I expected everybody to be quite anxious, but, especially... (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
DR. JOHN SMITH ...Andrew, because he ah, had come across with somebody with a rather different life experience to me before, by what I've seen before a group. 

00:07:45
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. But you made an opening statement, and that certainly reduced the anxiety. But it also seemed to allow the group members not feel so dependent on you for what happened. 

00:07:55
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes, that's right, and when Andrew came in first, showing how anxious he was, it was possible for me to... (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:08:05
DR. JOHN SMITH ...involve him in the group by just following his lead. 

00:08:05
GRAEME MCGRATH  Right. And Mary came out with some of her fears, which Andrew could respond to. I thought he learned quite a lot about Mary from that process as well. 

00:08:15
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. Yes. 

00:08:15
GRAEME MCGRATH  Then you, kind of, opened up the issue by, uhm, suggesting that other people might share Mary's fears. 

00:08:25
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. It's mined(ph) throughout the group, uhm, was to first of all concentrate things on what was happening in the group. 

00:08:35
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:08:35
DR. JOHN SMITH So I wanted it to bring it back to the group. But also, I wanted to stimulate the sense of shared experience, and that's what I was, ah, what I was doing there. 

00:08:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. I mean, I thought when Christine came in, she was being pretty defensive, but Peter's response was fairly illuminating. It sounds like he's got expectations of Christine already. 

00:08:50
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes, yes. And, and what was exciting was the sense that people are forming relationships already and the group was beginning to gel as a group. 

00:08:55
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm, right, just in the first few minutes. 

00:09:00
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. 

00:09:00
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:09:00
GRAEME MCGRATH So here we'd like to show the same group beginning again, illustrating that small differences in the behavior of the conductor can have major effects on the way that the group progresses. 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:15
ANDREW  Well, there's no one else is, ah, saying anything, perhaps I hope to ah, start by introducing myself. My, my name's Andrew, I'm a financial adviser, and I'm here to, to beat my drinking problem. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:09:45
ANDREW  Well, I've been to a few of this sorts of meetings before myself, so, ah, perhaps, ah, I should start because I've, I've always found that it's best if we, ah, start with some sort of agenda. I mean, first on my agenda is to ask the doctor here how to, ah, sort out my drinking problem. Now, I mean if everybody else could do that and, ah, add to the agenda what, what it is they want to put down there. We can get over it, can't we? So, ah, who's first? 

00:10:15
MAGGIE  I wonder if we should all introduce ourselves. I'm Maggie. 

00:10:25
MARY Come on, Peter. 

00:10:25
ANDREW I've already introduced myself. 

00:10:30
MARY Ah, I'm Mary. 

00:10:30
CHRISTINE And I'm Christine. 

00:10:30
DR. JOHN SMITH  I'm Doctor Smith, as you all know. 

00:10:45
[sil.] 

00:10:45
MARY  I don't know if anybody's ever been to a group like this before. I'm, I know I haven't. Uhm, I was thinking about how it might be when I came alone here. And I'm wondering how, how it would start. I, I suppose I was, was thinking that Dr. Smith probably would say something about that and, and sort of get us started. But, uhm, but it's clearly not going to be like that. I suppose he knows what he's doing. Perhaps he's just going to wait and see how we will react together. My only other experience of a group is when I talk to my brother, 'coz I, I told him that I was coming alone(ph) here tonight. And he told me about a television program that he'd seen. And this television program had showed, showed a group actually working together with, with the doctor or therapist or something. And, and they were really getting stuck into each other. I mean, they were having arguments and shouting at each other, and really getting quite aggressive. And there was one particular man in this group who, all the aggression seem to center around. I mean, he was really quite a strong character. 

00:12:00
ANDREW When I saw, saw the doctor before coming here, I mean, the thing that came across to me was that you actually can't come in here with a negative attitude. You've actually got to want to work on your problems. You got to work hard. And the, the thing that strikes me is, well, I know a bit about psychology. I'm sure the doctor here will agree with me that, that you've actually got to get in there and expose your problems, get down to the "nitty-gritty" that's what we've got to do. I mean, me for instance, my problems really begun with, particularly with my wife's affair, I went home and found her in bed with someone else. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:40
DR. JOHN SMITH  I think what ah, Andrew is probably saying is that, ah, he is afraid that he'll have to fight with the other men in the group for the possession of the women. Perhaps, particularly you'll have to fight with me. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:00
CHRISTINE  That's typical. 

00:13:10
[sil.] 

00:13:10
CHRISTINE  All men do all the time is just to come in and take over. It's ego, all ego, to use a bit of psychology. 

00:13:25
ANDREW Jesus Christ! What a load of shit. I've come in here, trying to get things started and all I get accused of is being a typical man. 

00:13:35
PETER I guess none of you failed to get worked up over it. So, perhaps we could all talk about something else for a bit. 

00:13:40
ANDREW Look, it's quite clear to me that I'm not wanted. You know, lots of clever comments going on all around the group. I mean, all you are is a bunch of bloody failures! 

00:13:50
GRAEME MCGRATH  Things seem to go pretty differently this time. 

00:13:55
DR. JOHN SMITH  Yes, I thought I would see what happened if I was much less involved in setting up the structure of the group from the beginning. I was much more distant. 

00:14:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. Well, the lack of an introductory comment seemed to leave Andrew and Maggie struggling. I mean perhaps to see who is gonna be dominant. 

00:14:10
DR. JOHN SMITH  Yes, and I think that's apparent in a much more dogmatic way, which Andrew came across, which felt... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:14:20
DR. JOHN SMITH ...as if very close to surface, there was the possibility of some kind of humiliation. 

00:14:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
DR. JOHN SMITH And it seemed to engender a very hostile reaction too in the other members of the group. 

00:14:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. And you didn't actually pick up Andrew's feelings directly. And it seemed that the rest of the group, ah, watching you do that. And that may well be incorporated in the way they function the fu, the future as a group. 

00:14:40
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes. I mean, I think already, ah, ah, it had set up aside the destructive culture in a group, which... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
DR. JOHN SMITH ...Mary refers to in, in, (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. 

00:14:45
DR. JOHN SMITH  indirect way. 

00:14:50
GRAEME MCGRATH And then when you did make an interpretation, it was not really very appropriate, and probably timed wrongly anyway, so, (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. 

00:14:55
GRAEME MCGRATH it left Andrew feeling perhaps even more humiliated. 

00:15:00
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. Well, I was having not really been involved in a more subtle way at the beginning. (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Yeah. 

00:15:05
DR. JOHN SMITH I was forced then to be involved much more strenuously... (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
DR. JOHN SMITH  and to make us a group interpretation, which actually came across as being both intrusive in one way, or rather distant, cold, whatever. (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm, right. 

00:15:15
GRAEME MCGRATH  The second anxiety provoking situation that we show is one that's likely to arise again and again in different forms while members of the group are establishing relationships with one another and with the leader. 

00:15:25
2. A special request to the leader. 

00:15:25
GRAEME MCGRATH  A member of the group asks for a specific personal relationship with the leader, which, on the face of it, doesn't seem wholly unreasonable. But what should the leader do? Let's assume that this group got through their problems of starting successfully, and move onto a group with the same members at a later date. 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:50
MARY  I know we're not really supposed to talk about this in a group, but I wonder if, if I could ask you something special? 

00:15:55
 Hmm. 

00:15:55
MARY  Well, I've been on these tablets for ages. And I saw a program on television about them. Uhm, the program said that you could get addicted to them, and then you would've, it's actually quite difficult to come off them. 

00:16:10
 Hmm. 

00:16:10
MARY And I got quite worried about that. So I went to see my doctor. And(ph), I mean, really, he just does not listen. He's not a bit like you. And he said I could just come straight off. And I'm sure that's not right. So, I wonder whether you could talk to him for me about that. Because I really do want to come off with these tablets, you know. 

00:16:30
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well, I think you're quite right to be concerned, ah, Mary, and, uhm, you know that these tablets can be a problem, and sometimes it is true that general practitioners don't seem to know very much about that(ph). 

00:16:45
MARY  Well, he doesn't seem to understand the first thing about them. Not like you. 

00:16:50
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well, that's the best thing is if you and I met outside the group, you know, at the end of the group this evening, and ah, you told me more about it, and, uhm, and see what I can do. 

00:17:05
MARY Thank you. 

00:17:05
PETER  Well I don't know. I thought just get us all these drugs anyway. They're just creating a nation of addicts. I bet it wouldn't do any good anyway. 

00:17:15
 Yeah(ph). 

00:17:15
MIKE But I thought we had a rule in this group that we wouldn't meet outside. 

00:17:20
ANDREW Oh it's not, it doesn't apply to, to Doctor Smith here. I mean, something, since being in, in the group, my, my drinking has got worse and there'd be times when I want to, to talk to him and sort things out. 

00:17:30
MAGGIE  Uhm, I found it incredibly useful talking to Doctor Smith. And in fact, I, I always wondered if it will be more useful if we're able to talk individually to you and at the group. 

00:17:45
GRAEME MCGRATH In this vignette, I thought you were modeling an essentially warm and caring but non-analytic conductor. 

00:17:50
DR. JOHN SMITH  Yes, I appear to be responding very favorably to the explicit content of what Mary said. (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
DR. JOHN SMITH But in doing that, I state my own and the group's attention away from what she might be saying in relation to the group. (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Yeah. 

00:18:05
DR. JOHN SMITH And in fact, she was asking me to side with her and attack on her general practitioner. And Peter quite correctly pointed out the significance of that in a group, and his comment that doctors can do damage, indicating that... (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:18:15
DR. JOHN SMITH  there may be some link with what was going on in a group. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. 

00:18:20
DR. JOHN SMITH But all that was missed 'coz I went through what she appeared to be saying right on the service. 

00:18:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm, and it's, those things will continue to be missed as long as you continue to be the boss and continue to be too benign. 

00:18:30
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. 

00:18:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:18:30
MARY  Oh, I've been on these tablets for ages. And I saw a program on the television about them. Uhm, the program said that you could get addicted to them, and that it's actually difficult to come off them. (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
 Hmm. 

00:18:45
MARY And I got quite worried about that. So I went to see my doctor. And(ph), I mean really, he just does not listen. He's not a bit like you. And he said I could just come straight off. And I'm sure that's not right. So, I wonder whether you could talk to him for me, about that. Because I really do want to come off with these tablets, you know? 

00:19:05
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well, ah, much as I'd like to help you, it's been my experience over the years that talking about medication to my patients in, in groups isn't totally helpful. 

00:19:20
CHRISTINE Uhm, but it's a real problem, isn't it? I mean, you know, GP's go around putting women on tablets and then they just don't offer any advice. All doctors are like that. 

00:19:30
MARY  Certainly my doctor's like that. He never listens. 

00:19:40
PETER  Perhaps if you did talk to him and explained it, he'll do something to help you come off it slowly. 

00:19:50
MARY  He said it was all right just to stop. 

00:19:55
MIKE Well, maybe he's really to it. Look, I've no idea why you need tablets anyway. You look all right to me. 

00:20:00
MAGGIE  Well, perhaps she only looks all right because she's on the tablets. I mean, I was all right and I looked all right when I was on the tablet. But when I tried to come of it quickly, it felt dreadful, it's(ph) awful for months. 

00:20:15
MARY Well, that's what this program said. If you do stop these tablets too quickly, you do feel dreadful. And I really can't face that. 

00:20:20
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well, this time I tried a completely different attack, and didn't respond at all... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:20:30
DR. JOHN SMITH ...to the explicit content of what Mary said, but challenged her and, and hope that she would say something about what it all meant as far as the group went. 

00:20:35
GRAEME MCGRATH Right, but the result was that you didn't get to know what Mary actually meant by talking about the tablet. So the group got into a rather sterile discussion while they were all trying to be helpful, but didn't seem to be able to work together. 

00:20:50
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes, and because I was stuck in the mode of, of thinking only in terms of relationships with the group. I couldn't even pick up Mary's indirect allusion to the fact that she felt I was one of those doctors who didn't listen, which is obviously... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
DR. JOHN SMITH ...an important thing to have brought out if I could have done. 

00:21:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm, it's all right. 

00:21:05
MARY So, I wonder whether you could talk to him for me about that. Because I really do want to come off with these tablets, you know? 

00:21:15
DR. JOHN SMITH Well, I can ah, I appreciate your concern about, ah, about the tablets. But, ah, I wonder whether it's really the right way to handle it, for me to ring up your GP. 

00:21:30
MARY  I think that's really evasive. Honestly, I really do. I don't know who else to go to ask for help about this. I mean, he doesn't listen. I thought you'd be different. 

00:21:45
PETER Yeah, the doctors put you on drugs, creating that, a nation of addicts. I don't think they do any good. 

00:21:50
DR. JOHN SMITH  You see, ah, I'm in something of a dilemma, because as you know, and as other members of the group knows, and as Peter knows, I am a doctor. And I do, as a doctor, prescribe tablets for people sometimes. And I do know something about tablets although I'm not sure whether I know anything more than your general practitioner knows. But I can't help feeling that if I were to get into a discussion about the tablets with you or get involved in your treatment by your GP, it would, might stop you being able to use the group to talk about what the tablets mean to you. And it might exclude other members of the group who might actually have something useful to say about tablets themselves. 

00:22:40
MIKE  In the end though, you can have to be responsible yourself as sorting it with your GP so you can get what you want from them. 

00:22:50
MARY But I've tried that. I went along every week to see this man. Every week for a year, and I prepare what I wanted to say. Somehow when I got there, I couldn't(ph) just let it get it out. 

00:23:05
MAGGIE  Mary, listen. I was on tablets for ages and ages. Whenever I was upset I go to the doctor for more tablets. And eventually, a friend sat me down and talked to me. And she made me realize that when I was getting upset, it was because I was getting so frustrated with other people at work, with my headmistress. And I just wasn't putting across what I wanted to say to her. And I found, once I started to do that a bit better, I didn't need the tablets the same. Couldn't you find a way to put yourself across to your doctor? 

00:23:40
MARY Well that's what was happening, wasn't it? I mean, I would go along with all this stuff prepared to say to him and I couldn't get it out. And I come up feeling absolutely furious, resentful and frustrated that, you know, he just didn't seem to want to hear. 

00:23:55
DR. JOHN SMITH Well, my strategy in this vignette was to try and combine both those approaches to hold... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
DR. JOHN SMITH ...in my mind simultaneously what was being said and why it was being said. And to try and get some idea or the attitude that Mary... (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Yeah(ph). 

00:24:05
DR. JOHN SMITH ...had towards the group. 

00:24:05
GRAEME MCGRATH  Let's say you picked up on Mary's dilemma, and without denying that you could help her with it, you looked at what the meaning was for the whole group. 

00:24:15
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes. And that approach seemed to pale(ph) because he's opened it up to other members of the group to make associations to what Mary was saying and to bring in their own feelings about doctors and then about parental figures. 

00:24:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. I mean, the group's actually got a lot of experience in dealing with problems. Uhm, you made use of that experience by handling the problem over to them. 

00:24:35
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. And the fact that Maggie was able to come in, (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
DR. JOHN SMITH ...also, did something for her self-esteem and brought... (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
DR. JOHN SMITH Maggie and Mary closer together to forge a close relationship between them. (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. And I guess Mary would have felt better because you clearly wanted to know about her and not just about her medication. 

00:24:50
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. 

00:24:50
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
GRAEME MCGRATH  As a group conductor, finding the balance between being over controlling and handing everything over to the group can be very difficult. It's true that groups need firm boundaries while they're meeting and that(ph) group processes a particularly sensitive to ruptures in those boundaries. 

00:25:10
3. Breaking the Boundaries 

00:25:10
GRAEME MCGRATH What happens if something happens in the group that breaks those boundaries and what is the leader's responsibility for dealing with it? We'll show that in the next vignette. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:20
MARY  I really think it's too bad that Mike's late again. Last week he said he'd definitely try and make a big effort to get here on time and look, he's not here. 

00:25:30
PETER  He also said that he's got lots of work to do. I think you should be a bit more tolerant, being late yourself before now. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:45
MIKE  Sorry, I'm late. 

00:25:50
MARY I should think so. 

00:25:50
MIKE  What do you mean? I can't help it I (inaudible ) a lot on at work. 

00:26:00
MARY You say that every week. In fact thinking about it, I'm not even sure that you really want to be in this group. 

00:26:05
PETER  I already said you aren't(ph) the only one to come late before you came in. I'm sure you've got a good reason. 

00:26:10
MAGGIE  Well, I could have a good reason for being late. I've got a lot of working to do and I have to leave it. I mean, I think if you make a commitment to people, you should stick to it. 

00:26:20
CHRISTINE This isn't getting us anywhere. I'm really bored. I don't really care whether Mike comes or not, let's think of something better to do. 

00:26:30
ANDREW It's all very well you're saying that young lady but I think good, good time, time keeping is the basis of any social situation. Goodness grace, I mean, what would have happen if we all came late? 

00:26:40
DR. JOHN SMITH  It seems that the group is having a problem agreeing how to make Mike stick to the rules. 

00:26:50
MAGGIE They're you rules, why don't you make him stick? 

00:26:55
MIKE All right, I'll, I'll be here on time next week. 

00:27:00
MARY  You say that every week, and look where it gets us, stuck in the same situation. 

00:27:10
CHRISTINE Who cares whether Mike comes or not? 

00:27:10
GRAEME MCGRATH  It looks in this vignette as though Mike's lateness is already becoming an important problem in the group and it's one they want to see controlled, I mean, either by Mike or by some people in the group. 

00:27:20
DR. JOHN SMITH  Right. It's interesting how the whole emphasis of the group is on control. 

00:27:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
DR. JOHN SMITH It's as if every in the group could think of any other way of handling it. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
DR. JOHN SMITH I don't help them to find any other way. 

00:27:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
DR. JOHN SMITH  And Christine does ask the question of what Mike is doing, but not in the spirit that leads on to any very constructive solutions and the group then didn't really picked up her, her, (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
DR. JOHN SMITH  her idea. 

00:27:45
GRAEME MCGRATH But you recognize social control as an issue but actually what you say seems to hand the whole issue back to the group. 

00:27:50
DR. JOHN SMITH Right, and, and the group end up feeling(ph)p completely powerless and, (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
DR. JOHN SMITH  and wondering what to do because nobody has the power to control Mike. 

00:27:55
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:00
MARY  It really is too bad, you know. I mean Mike promised last week that he'd make a special effort to get here on time and look, he still isn't here tonight. 

00:28:10
DR. JOHN SMITH  Had you have any message from him? What do you think his reason about for not coming? 

00:28:20
MARY  I don't know, but I think if you make a commitment to something, that you totally will come get there on time if you try. 

00:28:30
DR. JOHN SMITH Sounds, it could(ph) really hurts you that Mike isn't here when you expect him to be. 

00:28:35
[sil.] 

00:28:35
MARY  I don't know, but it seems like when he does come, I mean he's not really very interested in being here and I suppose that makes me feel that we're not important enough for him to come to get here in time for. 

00:28:55
PETER  I don't think we should be talking(ph) about him behind his back like this. He isn't here to speak up for himself. I know he's got a lot of work for the moment and you're been late before Mary. 

00:29:05
DR. JOHN SMITH  Do you feel it, as if Mary is criticizing? 

00:29:10
PETER Yes, I do. I think she's acting like his mother or something. 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:20
MIKE  Sorry, I'm late. 

00:29:25
[sil.] 

00:29:25
DR. JOHN SMITH  We were just speculating about your reasons for being late, and, ah, noting that you've been late a few times just recently. 

00:29:35
MIKE Uhm, yes, that's, it is what concern me. But I'm really busy at the moment. 

00:29:40
PETER  And what it's like doesn't allowed it anyway, you've got to do what the boss is saying or you're out. 

00:29:45
MIKE  Yeah, yeah. Although actually it's, it's not done (inaudible ) for me really. I know I said I'd be on time. 

00:29:55
MARY Well, why don't you shed your enough time to come to the group on time? 

00:30:00
CHRIS  I think you want us to notice you. I think that's one of a kind. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:10
MIKE  Look, if, if, if you must know, I always can't (inaudible ) plenty of time to come to the group but don't you think, well, well why should I be the first person here? So, find yourself something to do and then, well I suppose, ah, then I realized I'm late when I come tonight. 

00:30:30
ANDREW  Do you think, you're being (inaudible ) and no one else when you come? 

00:30:36
MIKE Yeah, I do. I mean, I suppose honestly, it's probably the reason why I'm late sometimes. 

00:30:40
ANDREW Hmm. 'Coz, 'coz it's important to know that someone's there, isn't it? 

00:30:45
MIKE Hmm, Yes, I mean, we're too large here, you know. When they come here, there are sound of people's voices talking when, when coming in. So I. 

00:31:00
DR. JOHN SMITH It sounds a bit to me like during your parent's talking, when you're lying behind as a child. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:10
PETER  I wish we'd had a family like that. All I ever heard was rattles. 

00:31:15
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well this time, I want to foster a counter in the group with thinking about Mike's lateness as being a communication... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
DR. JOHN SMITH ...rather than a challenge. So even before he arrives, I set the scene by asking the group "what they think about, what... (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
DR. JOHN SMITH ...it means by being late." 

00:31:35
GRAEME MCGRATH Right, so they start off with an interest in Mike's lateness and what he's going to say about it. 

00:31:40
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. 

00:31:40
GRAEME MCGRATH And the issue of what it means is, has just never left after that. 

00:31:45
DR. JOHN SMITH Right, and when Mike comes instead the group having rather stereotyped responses, (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
DR. JOHN SMITH ...they actually have number of revealing things to say... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
DR. JOHN SMITH ...about themselves in relations to his lateness. 

00:31:55
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. And this facilitates the way the group runs, so actually when it comes down to it, Mike is able to say that his lateness is actually something to do with his insecurity in, in fact related to his feelings of loneliness and abandonment when he was a child. 

00:32:10
DR. JOHN SMITH Right. That's right, and that brings things along for Mike as far as the group case but he also has the added advantage that next time Mike comes to be late, (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
DR. JOHN SMITH ...the group will remember that and think what's Mike saying about his feelings and about his feelings of abandonment... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
DR. JOHN SMITH ...at the moment(ph) and not jumping to the, we've got to control Mike, (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
DR. JOHN SMITH ...kind of, (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
DR. JOHN SMITH ...thing again. 

00:32:30
GRAEME MCGRATH But it might mean that Mike doesn't have to use lateness in that way again. 

00:32:35
DR. JOHN SMITH That's true. That's so true. 

00:32:35
GRAEME MCGRATH  We've considered the conductor's responsibilities to the group and how these differ from the normal everyday ones of the mental health professional. We've shown him taking different degrees of responsibility, and when he takes a share of the responsibility but looks of the meaning of communications for the group, this has seem to work out best. What happens though when the situation arises in which he has a professional obligation to respond? 

00:33:00
4. A psychiatric emergency 

00:33:00
GRAEME MCGRATH What if there is an emergency? This is the situation that we show in the next three scenes. 

00:33:05
MARY  You (inaudible ) tonight Chris, I was thinking about you last week. You said you are feeling very fed up. 

00:33:20
CHRISTINE Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
MARY I've been worried about you. 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:20
CHRIS  Well, I wasn't really gonna say anything this week. I decided not before coming. In fact, I've been thinking whether or not I should leave the group really. It doesn't seem to be doing any good. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:45
PETER  Well I guess that's something we need time to discuss. You're always doing this, bringing in important things right near at the end of the group. 

00:33:55
CHRISTINE Well to tell you the truth, I've been thinking about killing myself for last week. I'm fed up and I'm fed up of coming here week after week and feeling worse. I feel much worse now than I did before I started coming. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:10
DR. JOHN SMITH  In my experience, when people start to think about killing themselves, what they're really wishing for is a kind of reunion with, ah, an idealized mother figure and I'm just wondering whether in saying what she has said, Chris is expressing something on behalf of the whole group, about the group's wish that an idealized parent to come to their aid at the moment and then in fact, the group is really expecting me to play that role. 

00:34:45
CHRISTINE  Jesus. 

00:34:55
[sil.] 

00:34:55
ANDREW  What are we gonna do now with this? We, we can possibly respond to that. Look at the time, about five minutes left in the group. It's ridiculous. 

00:35:10
MAGGIE  You, you know Chris, sometimes ah, you do feel worse before you feel better. I mean, I once felt so bad I had to go into hospital. When I came out, I, I wondered how I could have been so stupid as to have thought of killing myself. 

00:35:25
PETER  Well, it doesn't seem to me that, is there anything we can do? I don't know whether Chris needs be in the hospital or not. I don't see I can stop her doing whatever it is that she wants to do. 

00:35:40
MARY  I don't think any of these is helping Chris. 

00:35:45
CHRISTINE  I don't think so either. I may not, I may not be here next week. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:00
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well I think it is very important we stick to the boundaries with the group and, ah, I do expect you all to be here next week, including Chris. 

00:36:25
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well in this vignette, I think that my most important task is to hang on to my role... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
DR. JOHN SMITH ...as the analytic conductor. So, that results in Chris's immediate feelings being ignored and also her relationship to the group and how things relate to the group being overlooked to. 

00:36:50
GRAEME MCGRATH Well, so you actually make an interpretation which involves the whole group which seems... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
DR. JOHN SMITH Yeah. 

00:36:50
GRAEME MCGRATH  to puzzle them quite a lot, but it also leads, as you say, the meaning of Chris's communication unclear. 

00:37:00
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes, and unfortunately the result of that is that, ah, Chris feels rejected and the group actually itself seems to do rather helpless. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. And overall, the feeling is the group ends too soon. 

00:37:10
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes. 

00:37:10
GRAEME MCGRATH There's a quite a lot of unfinished business and I guess that leaves you feeling quite anxious as reflected in your last statement? 

00:37:15
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes. I, I, I am not really not having dealt with the anxiety for myself either. 

00:37:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Alright. 

00:37:20
ANDREW You always bring an important things just to end of the group. 

00:37:25
CHRISTINE Well to tell you the truth, I've been thinking about killing myself the last week. I'm fed up, and I'm fed up of coming here week after week and feeling worse. I feel much worse now than I did before I started coming. 

00:37:35
DR. JOHN SMITH  You sound very depressed, Chris. 

00:37:45
CHRISTINE I've been depressed for weeks. I just feel so fed up, so tired. 

00:37:55
DR. JOHN SMITH  Are you having trouble with your sleep? 

00:38:00
CHRISTINE I can't sleep, I can't sleep at all. 

00:38:05
DR. JOHN SMITH What about your appetite, how's that? 

00:38:10
CHRISTINE I can't be bothered. I'm not eating very much. 

00:38:15
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well, I wonder if you develop some kind of depressive illness, perhaps, ah, you need some different treatment for that, it's really take a few words about it. 

00:38:30
CHRISTINE Okay. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:35
PETER  I want to speak for my own but, but I didn't know you're allowed. 

00:38:40
MAGGIE  Well, I'd been sleeping badly too, I think I want to go up and see my GP for some tablet 'coz he's very understanding. May, maybe, maybe Chris doesn't need to see a doctors. You can decide if she needs to go into hospital. 

00:39:00
ANDREW It seems to me like this is just what, Chris wants to see the doctor, so plenty of time to talk about it in the group and chosen not too. I mean, the rest of us had brought up problems to the group, she's had the space as well. 

00:39:15
MARY  That's one of her difficult decision, isn't it? She just doesn't talk in the group. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:25
DR. JOHN SMITH  Well we, we don't have to finish. I'm sure, that at(ph), ah, everybody in the group would want me to have a few words with you to make sure you're going to be all right the next week... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
CHRISTINE Okay. 

00:39:45
DR. JOHN SMITH  and stay behind. 

00:39:50
DR. JOHN SMITH  For this time I do respond immediately to Chris's distress but somehow I give the group to understand that I'm the only one who can deal with it. 

00:40:00
GRAEME MCGRATH Right, so that diverts them from either facing her distress or actually finding other ways in dealing with it. 

00:40:05
DR. JOHN SMITH Right, and it leaves them out. So Peter and Andrew look very upset and seemed envious... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
DR. JOHN SMITH  and angry and obviously I'm part on the process of helping and Maggie talks about alternative strategies completely outside the group, going to a GP, for example. 

00:40:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Right so, in some way the group hasn't manage to share in the process of containing Chris's distress and dealing with it. So you're left to deal with it all on your own and in fact deal with it outside the group. 

00:40:30
DR. JOHN SMITH Right, right. 

00:40:35
MARY You haven't said(ph) a lot tonight Chris. I was thinking about you last week. You said you've been very fed up. 

00:40:45
CHRISTINE Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
MARY I've been worried about you. 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:50
CHRISTINE  Well, I wasn't really gonna say anything this week. I decided not before coming. In fact I've been thinking whether or not I should leave the group really. It doesn't seems to be doing me any good. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:10
PETER  Well, I guess that's something we need time to discuss. You're always doing this, bringing here an important things, right near the end of the group. 

00:41:20
CHRISTINE Well, to tell you the truth, I've been thinking about killing myself for last week. I'm fed up, and I'm fed up of coming here week after week and feeling worse. I feel much worse now than I did before I started coming. 

00:41:35
DR. JOHN SMITH I'm conscious on the fact that you told us what you have in the last few minutes of the group and it seems to you haven't given us much of an opening to understand what's stressing you so much. You clearly want us to know how distressed you are. You, you feel that somehow we should be available and yet, it seems as if you don't really expect us to be able to help you. 

00:42:05
CHRISTINE  I just, I just feel here as if nobody cares, as if nobody cares what I think or what I feel. 

00:42:20
MARY  But Chris, that's not right. That's why I just asked you something then. It feels very difficult because you don't talk much in the group and I don't know what goes on inside your head. When we try, you've, ah, you'll just get angry. 

00:42:40
MAGGIE  Hmm, that's right. I, I care too, Chris, but sometimes I just don't know how to get thru to you. 

00:42:50
DR. JOHN SMITH It seems there are several people in the group feel they do care but you can't experience it. 

00:42:55
CHRISTINE  I don't know. 

00:43:00
MIKE  Yeah, I've been feeling like that as well. You know, I love(ph) recently. I was wondering if, I don't know, but if there was something to do with John going away, ah, whatever is it, in three weeks or whatever. 

00:43:20
ANDREW  Now, it didn't seem we have much time left, I don't know what we could possibly do with all of that? 

00:43:30
PETER  Because you didn't have anyone to sit next to if John was away. 

00:43:35
MIKE Hmm. 

00:43:35
CHRISTINE  I, I don't know. I feel scared. I just feel scared. I feel scared about John going away. Ah, I don't understand. 

00:43:55
MARY I'm going to worry about you all week, Chris, unless I know, that you're going to be okay. Uhm, I mean, John, isn't there, anything that you can do in the meantime? 

00:44:10
DR. JOHN SMITH  You mean like seeing Chris or something like that? 

00:44:15
MARY  Uh hmm. 

00:44:20
DR. JOHN SMITH Well, I could do but it seems as if what Chris is anxious about is, depends on life to the group, that everyone is anxious about. And it seems to me that it will be important for her to be able to talk about it in, in the group, if that were possible. In someway, I feel if I were to see Chris during the week, it would, perhaps to track her up, you know? Of course I'm happy to do that if you feel that you need to see me. But I wonder if you, if you can hang on 'til next week. 

00:44:55
CHRISTINE  Uhm, I would like to see you. I would really, I really would like to see you but(ph). I think it's best that, that I don't and, and I think, I think I will be all right. Ah, I think I will be able to come until next week. 

00:45:35
DR. JOHN SMITH  Okay. Well, uhm, you know, you, you do have my phone number like everyone in the group, and please don't hesitate to ring me if you feel you have to and, that's, that's fine. But if I don't hear from you then, also expect to have a space free next time to talk about this which is oversee not only an important issue for you but for the, for the whole group really, isn't it? 

00:46:05
CHRISTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
DR. JOHN SMITH But we do really have to end now. 

00:46:05
MARY  Please, please try to talk next week, Chris? We will try to help you to talk. 

00:46:15
CHRISTINE I'll try. Yeah. Okay. 

00:46:15
GRAEME MCGRATH  So, this time, you concentrated more on the meaning of Chris's communication and in particular, the effect that it was having on individual members of the group. 

00:46:25
DR. JOHN SMITH Right and this seem to allow the, the members of the group in so that, ah, Maggie and Mary were actually able to... (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. 

00:46:30
DR. JOHN SMITH  say how they cared but also to the thing on a bit by talking about their relationship with Chris. Mike and Peter were able to take things on further with thinking about Chris's relationship to me, then natural general air reflection enabled her to go beyond her immediate problem to talk about fears of abandonment. 

00:46:50
GRAEME MCGRATH  Right. And so Chris's distress wasn't just seen as an isolated problem but was seen in terms of her relationships with others in the group, and also something that they could respond to and deal with. 

00:47:00
DR. JOHN SMITH  Yeah. 

00:47:05
GRAEME MCGRATH But I guess they also left you enough flexibly to, flexibility to deal with her depression if you felt you have to. 

00:47:10
DR. JOHN SMITH Yes, but I felt comfortable about doing it that way. I mean, I would have felt bad about not giving her that option but in a sense I felt I've given her the option to choose rather than impose that for myself that I was quite comfortable leading the group as I did. 

00:47:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Right. 

00:47:25
GRAEME MCGRATH Normally, group processes unfold gradually and there may be long periods when nothing seems to be happening. The scenarios in this tape deliberately happen rapidly but we hope that they're emotionally true to life and we hope that they'll have given you some of the flavor of what it's like to actually be in a group. So, if you're thinking of starting a group, take a grip on your anxieties, fix up some supervision, and start, and best of luck.
