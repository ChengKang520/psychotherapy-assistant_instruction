NARRATOR When children are abused either emotionally, physically or sexually. They may no longer feel that their world is a safe place. While all abused children are affected by the experience. Some are able to cope and move on with their lives, others however or not. Play therapy provides an opportunity for these children to work through their problems. 

00:00:40
Essentials of play Therapy with Abused Children PLAY with Eliana Gil 

00:00:50
NARRATOR Many children who are abused are unable to verbalize their feelings. Others are unwilling to, because they believe people are not be trusted. Play therapy offers children an opportunity to express painful emotions, resolve their difficulties and resume the normal process of development. 

00:01:05
ELIANA GIL I think that the most important goal in working with children who have been abused or traumatized is to restore a level of functioning as soon as possible. 

00:01:20
NARRATOR Dr. Eliana Gill is a family therapist as well as a registered play therapist. 

00:01:25
ELIANA GIL , Ph.D. You can draw a picture basically of anything you like, anything you want and using as many colors or as few colors as you want and there is… Events have occurred that have taken the child by surprise, used up some of the energies they would usually have available for other task that have to do with development. Um… They have a certain amount of anxiety or fear, confusion or distress or pain that they've have to deal with. And our goal is basically to provide a corrective reparative experience, make sure that, whatever questions the child has have been answered in some way and make sure that feelings that are associated with the events have been expressed and again not necessarily verbally, but in some way. I mean that the child has had an opportunity to look at this event and put it behind them as suppose to continuing to be engaged with it. But the most important thing is restore the level of functioning. Hopefully get the child back to where they were before this event happened and caused some kind of interruption in their developmental process. 

00:02:35
ELIANA GIL In this videotape, I'll describe how play therapy can address the specific needs of children who've been abused. First I'll explain the impact that abuse has on children. Then I'll show you how to establish rapport with these children by creating an environment that's conducive to the healing process. I'll also demonstrate several play therapy methods that address some of the problems commonly experienced by abused children. 

00:02:55
The Impact of Abuse Establishing Rapport Play Therapy Methods 

00:03:00
ELIANA GIL Hello there, how are you miss? 

00:03:05
ELIANA GIL The children you see me working with are not actual patients. They have volunteered to help in the production of this videotape with the permission of their parents. Although, they are not patients, my work with them will illustrate many of the play therapy techniques I typically employ with abused children. You will notice that the play therapy techniques may be the same, but abused children have unique responses and are common on those differences from time to time. 

00:03:30
The Impact of Abuse 

00:03:40
NARRATOR Feelings of belonging, feelings of significance, feelings of virtue and the attainment of love are critical to a child's development of identity. And it is these very feelings that are compromised in a child who has been abused. Abuse effects children in a variety of ways, creating a wide spectrum of symptoms from apparently mild to obviously severe. These include fear and anxiety, depression, anger, hostility or aggression, precocious or aggressive sexual behavior, low self-esteem and difficulty maintaining relationships. Untreated the effects of abuse will continue to impact the child throughout his or her life. 

00:04:25
SYMPTOMATIC BEHAVIORS Fear and anxiety Depression Anger, hostility or aggression Precocious or aggressive sexual behavior Low self-esteem Difficulty maintaining relationships 

00:04:25
ELIANA GIL It does appear that it has an impact on the development of self, in terms of how people view themselves whether they feel good about themselves or feel that they have something to offer they're lovable or worthwhile. And of course, that feeling of not being a worthwhile human being affects their choices and the decisions they make about things, they pursue or don't pursue. So the self seems to be very affected by the experience of child that abuse. Going along with that, you've problems with trusting people, problems about being dependent on others. Obviously, there are sorts of relationship problems that can come up um… within the concept of relationships. There can be problems with sexual dysfunctions. There can be problems with violence and the repetition sometimes of the dynamics of abuse that they encountered in childhood. So it would not be unusual for example, for someone with a history of physical abuse. To end up in an adult relationship where violence is part of that. I think one of the most insidious lessons of physical abuses is that people who love you will hurt you. There are lots of other areas where people have difficulty, sometimes self-destructive behaviors. If they began to view themselves as people who deserve to be abuse, sometimes they punish themselves. You have behaviors, such as the substance abuse. There is a part that's a punishment and a part that I think involves numbing, so that they don't feel anything and things aren't as difficult and their emotions are easier to deal with for them. Those kinds of situations can come up as well. 

00:05:55
ELIANA GIL In my experience, no two abused children behave the same way. Some externalize their difficulties and those around them can sense there is a problem. Others internalize their pain and apparently develop adaptive behavior such as excelling in school or at sports. Still others see more stress resistant or resilient and apparently fair better. Despite, having a list of symptoms as a guideline for making an assessment of abuse. You should avoid relying on them exclusively as a diagnostic tool to conclude or confirm abuse. The same list of symptoms may indicate distress for example, due to parental divorce of death, family alcoholism, neurological problems, family violence or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

00:06:45
SOURCES OF STRESS Parental divorce of death Family alcoholism Neurological problems Family violence ADHD 

00:06:50
"Sexual abuse and its impact should be seen along a continuum ranging from neutral to very negative. It is important to recognize this variability because it reminds us again of the hopefulness that can be present even in traumatic events and that the possibility for positive change always exists." Otto Friedrich, 1990 Establishing Rapport 

00:07:20
ELIANA GIL They always like to touch the sand it feels good on your hands and underneath… 

00:07:25
NARRATOR When a child first comes to therapy, there are some things that are important to keep in mind. First of all, the child may not know why he or she is coming to therapy. May not know there is a problem, may already be distrustful of adults and in a minimum probably feels anxious. 

00:07:40
ELIANA GIL Let's see if I can, if I make a letter if you know what it is? 

00:07:45
A. 

00:07:45
ELIANA GIL Absolutely. 

00:07:50
NARRATOR Because the child does not know, what to expect. One of the first things to do, is to create a therapeutic rapport. 

00:07:55
ELIANA GIL I think building rapport with children is an interesting process it's challenging. You have to be so open initially to the human being you're going to see and just allow them enough space, enough distance, enough safety and respect, that they can began feeling more and more comfortable and more likely to show themselves to you. Not only the parts of themselves may be that they are comfortable with, but the parts of themselves that they are not. Now, everything is organized for you. Do you like it? 

00:08:35
ELIANA GIL I try to develop rapport by first giving the child a tour of the play therapy room. So the child can see all the available options and choices. I also limit the number of questions I ask initially and I try to empathize with any discomfort, he or she may be having. I'll also let a child's parent stay with us until the child feels more at ease. In our initial meeting, I said the context for the therapy, explaining then I'm someone who works with children by talking some and playing some. And I tell the child that he or she can say as much or as little as they want. I say that we'll use some of the toys in the room and that I'm available to listen or answer any questions. The object is to provide an atmosphere in which the child feels little pressure, some control and eventually feelings of safety and trust. Keep in mind however, that not all children will respond to a safe atmosphere with immediate trust. Some kinds who've been abused find that concept a little uncomfortable. 

00:09:40
ELIANA GIL One child, I'm working with right now has been very-very reluctant to talk about certain things. And she said to me from the first meeting, I'm not gonna tell about that. And I said something to her like, well that's fine. I think it's a really good idea to only say things when you want to and not to have to feel like somebody is making you do, because I can't make you do anything. Well, it's been now about six months in the other day, she said to me. Um… so if I wanna talk about serious things in here I can, can't I. And then I said well, only if you would want to. No but if I wanted to I could. They said yeah, I mean if you want to do, I'm certainly available to listen to you. But it's taken that long to get from point A to point B. 

00:10:25
NARRATOR In the treatment of abused children, there are two different approaches that play therapist use, directive and non-directive. Typically, the theoretical model that the therapist utilizes guides the levels of the therapist activity. For example, psychoanalytic play therapist are non-directive by nature. 

00:10:45
ELIANA GIL The non-directive approach comes from the psychoanalytic theory um… that basically holds to the fact that the child will bring forward, whatever unconscious material that child needs to bring forward and you leave it alone and you let it take as long as it takes. And the directive approach is much more that you need to guide children to certain material. So you got the better of the dinosaur, ah. 

00:11:10
Yep. 

00:11:10
NARRATOR Therapists who work from different theoretical models including behavioral, humanistic and developmental, use to play to direct children to the pertinent issues. 

00:11:20
ELIANA GIL It seems like you have friends and then you lose friends. 

00:11:25
Yep. 

00:11:25
ELIANA GIL What's it like for you when you lose your friends? 

00:11:30
ELIANA GIL How do these approaches differ from each other? I tend to look at it in this way. A non-directive approach provides the child with ample opportunity to direct his or her own therapy and encourages insight and personality development through verbal interpretation of play and behavior. The directive therapist takes primary responsibility for guiding the therapy process and challenges the child to address specific concerns or change specific thoughts or behaviors. In my opinion, the non-directive therapies are most critical and effective at the beginning of treatment. And in some cases, they may be the treatment of choice throughout the full course of therapy. 

00:12:10
ELIANA GIL The non-directive approach demands very little of the child. It also says to the child, you're in control here. You get to select what you want to play with. This is a time that's just for you. This is designed just for you and you're needs and whatever it is that you think might be helpful to you. 

00:12:30
ELIANA GIL I have found that working with abused children requires me to be a eclectic since children fluctuate between wanting to master and at the same time wanting to avoid painful situations. 

00:12:40
ELIANA GIL Children have basically two drives, one drive is to master difficult situations and I think developmentally we see that all the time. Child has a problem, the child is challenged and often finds great pleasure in trying to solve that problem and that has to do with mastering and has to do with control. But along the same lines, I think kids have another drive and that is to suppress material that's difficult, that's painful or that's uncomfortable to them. 

00:13:10
ELIANA GIL Although may play therapist follow a strict theoretical model, others follow an integrated approach in recognition of the fact that children may react more or less favorably to one or another. I let the child determine what approach I will use. 

00:13:30
ELIANA GIL I noticed that in play when children have been abused that they deal with these things so differently. So one child will come in and basically lay the whole thing out in front of you and of obviously in front of themselves and say this is what happened to me and this is what I think about it or this is how I feel about it and they'll do that symbolically sometimes or they'll do that in their art work or they'll do that in a variety of ways, but they're doing it. And other children will come in and they're adamant that this is not anything I'm ever gonna speak about. Um… and their play doesn't even symbolically bring any of those issues that one might expect would be, included in an experience like that. So kids can go either directions, so I think what that means to me is that I have to wait and see what kind of a child I'm working with in order to determine how to best be helpful to the child. 

00:14:30
"Play therapy may be directive in form, that is, the therapist may assume responsibility for guidance and interpretation - or it may be non-directive; the therapist may leave responsibility and direction to the child." Virginia Axline, 1969 Play Therapy Methods 

00:14:55
ELIANA GIL When kids come to see me, what we do is the kids get to decide what they want to play with and what they want to do? 

00:15:00
And I have two… 

00:15:05
ELIANA GIL In working with abused children, I've found that the standard therapeutic toys are very effective. However, I have added a few toys that seem particularly helpful. These include but are not limited to the following toys and activities. Telephones, sunglasses, feeling cards, puppets, sand and miniatures, art materials, nursing bottles, dishes and utensils, medical kits, shields, capes and plastic swords and a courtroom replica 

00:15:35
TOYS AND ACTIVITIES Telephones Sunglasses Feeling Cards Puppets Sand and Miniatures Art Materials Nursing Bottles Dishes and Utensils Medical Kits Shields, Capes and Plastic Swords Courtroom Replica 

00:15:40
ELIANA GIL When we're working with children we have to assume that the most useful medium for them is gonna be play. So we want to have toys that are carefully chosen, purposefully chosen. So that they can use them a symbols to communicate to us, whatever concerns are going on. So for example, one of the first things that I try to teach people when we're talking about play therapy is, you can't just put generic toys in there because then what you're setting up is some kind of a playroom, where kids will come in and do generic play. When you're doing play therapy, you have to carefully select out things that have the potential to be used symbolically for communication of difficult things. Particularly, it's true when we are working with abused traumatized children that we need to have materials available to them that relate to the experience and the dynamics of the experience. 

00:16:35
NARRATOR Children express their inner thoughts and feelings in many different ways. However, drawing and painting are especially useful in the treatment of children who have suffered abuse. 

00:16:45
ELIANA GIL Chris is not an abused child, but his work serves as an example of a child who has a sense of mastery over his life and has a good self-concept. These are some of the factors, artwork and illustrate. 

00:17:00
ELIANA GIL It also helps us see how they organize their own world. So if you say to a child, draw a picture for example of your family? When they do that, it helps us to see how they see things. When you ask children to, to draw something about their family or something about ah… a family activity. The content that comes up usually tends to be something it's fairly important to the family. A lot of the children that we work with who are abused, the issues of self-esteem and the issues of even just bringing up for example family activity may to them suggest something painful or may suggest something that they're longing for. So right away, you'll see a different effect connected to the experience of drawing this difficult material. 

00:17:50
ELIANA GIL The drawings and paintings created by abused children can yield a tremendous amount of information to the therapist. However, interpreting the meaning of their work is not a simple task. Barbara Sobol and Carol Thayer Cox are registered art therapist and professors at George Washington University, Art Therapy Department. 

00:18:10
BARBARA SOBOL , A.T.R Well, I think that art offers children something they are very familiar with and they are very comfortable with. Most kids really like to pick up a paint brush or crayons and draw and it's a natural environment for them to be doing art. Also, I think with abused children. They are more afraid of talking and exposing what really went on and sometimes it's really just simpler and more natural for them to express what happened without having to articulate it and in some ways get themselves in trouble by articulating it. 

00:18:45
CAROL THAYER COX , A.T.R So often children who've been abused have been told not to tell by the abuser and have been threatened if they do tell that something terrible would happen to them. So they often don't and they keep it a secret for years and years and so the opportunity to do something nonverbally is helpful for them to able to communicate what happened. 

00:19:05
ELIANA GIL When assessing the artwork of children who have been abused are subjective responses may be informative as well as the themes that children suggest through their images, colors or verbal descriptions. 

00:19:15
CAROL THAYER COX There are certain themes that, that show up with the children. There are themes about the abuse when they actually are depicting a scenario of abuse and but that's a theme to, to look for the specific theme of looking at the abuser and the victim and what's occurred or, or where the abuse occurred? That, that shows up a lot with the environment which had occurred. 

00:19:40
BARBARA SOBOL Some of those things you might see um… is an expression of particularly with sexual abuse. You might see the sexuality or an over focus on sexuality or explicit focus on sexuality appear in pictures and it's opposite, which would be the absolute avoidance of mentioning or depicting a topic that's frightening. So that if again, if it's sexuality, it would be avoidance of sexual parts so that parts of the body that would (inaudible ) sexuality. 

00:20:11
ELIANA GIL Art work can also be an indicator of the child's sense of self that is how they view and feel about themselves. 

00:20:20
CAROL THAYER COX See you might see the, the sense of being damaged ah… you can see that again it can show up in, in depiction of a tree or a house. Um… when children draw houses with cracks going down the more. Ah… a tree that has scarred(ph) or with broken braches, it's a just a sense of, of not being hold. And as well you could see a sense of fear, sense of being really scared. And children can do that's depict that so poignantly in the… in the work, in the art work. 

00:20:50
SAND TRAY 

00:20:55
NARRATOR Sand play therapy proposes that the sand tray is symbolic of the child's psyche an externalization of their internal world. As the child creates this world, the therapist observes and engages the child, in order to more fully understand the symbolic meaning. 

00:21:10
ELIANA GIL So the idea is you can take whatever you want from over there and then just build the little world inside here. 

00:21:15
Okay. 

00:21:20
ELIANA GIL Okay and you can also put, I told you to pour… 

00:21:20
ELIANA GIL Again Anthony is not an abused child but his work in the sand tray nicely demonstrates how a child's inner world can be expressed externally. The play is therapeutic in and of itself and provides the child with ample opportunities for reparative experiences. My job is to be a quite, but active observer. I pay attention to what he chooses or avoids. What he puts back or keeps in the tray. How he organizes the miniatures? What he pays more or less attention to, if his affect changes during the building of the world? In addition, I watch to see how he interacts with the materials. That is, is he careful and hesitant, looking up for approval or is he care free and comfortable. Children often produce intricate scenarios abundant with symbolism. As with drawings or paintings, I watch for repetitive themes or patterns of interaction overtime before developing clinical hypothesis. 

00:22:25
ELIANA GIL You don't conclude anything on the basis of one drawing or one sand tray. But you take some notes, some mental notes and then you watch for the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and then you see the themes appear are there always catastrophes is that, are the children always in danger. Is someone available to help the children? Do they get rescued or are they always left in this paralyze conditioned and there's no one to help them with. Are they nurtured? Are they safe? You know there are so many themes that come out in these materials. Now, what are you building there, Anthony? 

00:23:00
ANTHONY Oh! This is the dungeon. 

00:23:05
ELIANA GIL Oh! It's a dungeon. Then what happens in the dungeon? 

00:23:10
ANTHONY It's where um… the bad people go. They don't be (inaudible ). 

00:23:16
ELIANA GIL Oh! I see. So break the rules means you go to the dungeon, huh? What kind of rules do you think they might break Anthony? 

00:23:30
ANTHONY Stealing money. 

00:23:30
ELIANA GIL Stealing money 

00:23:35
ANTHONY Thieves. 

00:23:35
ELIANA GIL Ah… ah… 

00:23:35
ELIANA GIL In my experience, the most striking difference in the sand play of abused children compared to non-abuse children is thematic. In contrast to Anthony's tray, abused children may create violent, disorganized, barren, dangerous or frightening environments. A less nurturing and safe world, where danger persists and rescuers are few and far between. 

00:24:00
ELIANA GIL Now, tell me a little bit about what this is? 

00:24:05
ANTHONY This is the king and queen's friend. Um… it's like the person who, (inaudible ) Godzilla to come rescues him. 

00:24:15
ELIANA GIL Um… Hmm… So this is a friend of the king and the queen. And this friend calls Godzilla to be the, you call them the guardian, right. He is going to take of people here. 

00:24:25
ANTHONY That this giant spider is gonna toward(ph) look at tire… tower and this is going to stole the calves. 

00:24:35
ELIANA GIL Umm… Hmm… So there is a lot of danger, but there is also a lot of protectors. A lot of people looking out for things that might happen, ah…? 

00:24:40
ELIANA GIL It's important to not jump to any conclusions about things here because, as I say typically kids may create a world like this what you would want to see is over a time, ah… whether there is a continuation of themes that are problematic to you. The fact that he creates a conflict is not a problem. The fact that he is able to resolve the conflict pretty well is a good indicator that this kid is doing just fine. If you have children where it's a danger valley, but the danger is always present and the danger cannot be overcome and there is no way to protect and there is no nurturing then you begin to see some other themes that of course you can get worried about. 

00:25:25
ELIANA GIL So is this a good place then to take the picture? 

00:25:30
ELIANA GIL It's in many ways a very typical tray for a child of his gender and his age and a child who is fairly healthy and comes from a very nurturing environment. 

00:25:40
PUPPETS 

00:25:45
ELIANA GIL How are you doing man? Give me five. 

00:25:45
NARRATOR Puppet play is another play therapy technique that offers several benefits to children. They can create stories, they can do so anonymously using specific characters to portray hidden conflicts or concerns. 

00:26:00
ELIANA GIL Puppets again are symbols and the puppets have mouth that the kids manipulate and I always encourage people make sure you have the mouth, because it right away cues the child, you're suppose to talk through this. And kids tell stories that are amazing using the puppets. Often times, if a child put a, puts a puppet of their hand they're no longer the child, there now with this puppet and they can tell you things as the squirrel who is lost and scared that they can't tell you as the little boy who is behind that little squirrel. So the putting on of these images and the pretend play that gets elicited by puppets is a remarkable way to again try to ascertain what really is going on for the child. 

00:26:45
I'm giving this to you, okay? 

00:26:50
Hmm… Hmm… 

00:26:50
Then you're like kind to go back down, okay 

00:26:55
Down here. 

00:26:55
Yeah. 

00:26:55
Okay. 

00:26:55
And then you find the dinosaur, okay. 

00:27:00
Uh… Huh… 

00:27:00
Then you like eat you up, okay 

00:27:05
ELIANA GIL The idea behind the puppet play is that it allows the child an opportunity to distance from difficult material to a kind of, if you want to use the words hide behind, but to identify with perhaps an object or a symbol of some kind then to project his or her own feelings and thoughts and situations on to that particular object and then create a story. 

00:27:35
This is a story called Peter and Dinosaur. A long time ago when my, when my little son had a best friend named Pena(ph). One day Pena(ph) died. 

00:27:50
ELIANA GIL Often the stories have a beginning, a middle and an end, and typically stories have a conflict that emerges, somewhere during the story. And then you also get to see through the child's creation of a conflict and then addressing the conflict. The primary modes by which the child might think about taking care of a problem or solving a problem or whatever. 

00:28:20
The wolf was and it's reminding its own business, along comes the dinosaur. Then the wolf eats the dinosaur. 

00:28:30
ELIANA GIL So the putting on of these images and the pretend play that gets elicited by puppets is a remarkable way to again try to ascertain what really is going on for the child. Because you have what the child shows you and then there is all the underlying things that are important for us to know about. And sometimes the behavior and the underlying issues really belie themselves. You can have a child who is angry and beating up every kid in the class. And you say gee what an… what an angry oppositional child. Underneath might be the loneliest, most scared child that you've ever seen or child who feels terribly, a terrible amount of longing for someone to care for him and has absolutely no notion how to get that to happen. So sometimes the best offense, the best defense is offense, so the child will come across as this really rugged strong kid, but underneath there is something else completely different going on. 

00:29:30
NARRATOR Play therapy is usually conducted with an individual child. However, it can also be useful for sibling sessions. Neither of these brothers is an abused victim, yet their puppet play offers an example of ways to explore alternative approaches to behaviors that might be the result of abuse. 

00:29:50
ELIANA GIL Hey, Mr. Dinosaur. 

00:29:50
Yes. 

00:29:50
ELIANA GIL Hey, Mr. Wolf don't go away. Mr. Dinosaur. 

00:29:55
Yes. 

00:29:55
ELIANA GIL Have you ever thought of not eating people? 

00:30:00
No. 

00:30:00
ELIANA GIL No, is it that you're hungry all the time? 

00:30:05
Sometimes. 

00:30:05
ELIANA GIL Sometimes, because I'm just wondering, do you think that you and Mr. Wolf could be friends rather than one of you having to eat the other. 

00:30:10
No I do that. 

00:30:15
ELIANA GIL Huh? 

00:30:15
That's a good idea. 

00:30:15
ELIANA GIL That's right, that's a good idea. 

00:30:15
ELIANA GIL Usually, when I do that with kids, it's in the vein of, well this is something that you guys can think about and at least what it's done is created an alternative option for them in terms of, how they might think about this particular situation. 

00:30:30
ELIANA GIL Okay? 

00:30:30
Okay. 

00:30:30
ELIANA GIL See you guys, bye. 

00:30:35
DOLL HOUSE 

00:30:40
ELIANA GIL And then over here Gio(ph), we have the doll house. 

00:30:45
GIOVANNA Some little baby rabbits. 

00:30:45
ELIANA GIL And lots of different kinds of families. 

00:30:50
NARRATOR Another valuable technique in play therapy that gives children a way to voice their experiences is the doll house. 

00:30:55
ELIANA GIL If we are talking with children, obviously they live in family environments. And so for example, the use of the doll house is… is very important because kids can create their information or communicate information about the environments in which they live. So I always talk to kids about, well let's say it's morning time in the house. So what happens now and how do people wake up and how do they know it's time to wake up. So sometimes, I cue kids to give me information, other times they just go in there and they just recreate things right away. 

00:31:30
GIOVANNA Then and the father goes quick to the living room and says good bye to the kids. 

00:31:35
ELIANA GIL Uh… Huh… 

00:31:35
GIOVANNA And he goes off to work, he uses a taxi. 

00:31:40
ELIANA GIL Uh… Huh… 

00:31:40
GIOVANNA Then you don't see him. 

00:31:40
ELIANA GIL Okay, so he's gone now, he's driving his taxi… I think that what you see with Giovanna is her willingness to ah… engage with me as the person who is available to her at the moment to engage with the play very freely and to report what she's doing. In other words, to verbalize what she is doing as she's doing it. 

00:32:05
GIOVANNA The mom's and dad's room to see… to jump on the beds. They are like jumping on the beds. 

00:32:15
ELIANA GIL That's a fun thing to do. 

00:32:15
GIOVANNA Then they go, then they go to the room to see what time it is to go to school. 

00:32:20
ELIANA GIL Oh! 

00:32:20
GIOVANNA But the brother and the sister has to take something. 

00:32:25
ELIANA GIL The themes that she presented, seem to pretty conflict free but something you might expect with the… a child may be who has been injured is less of a(ph) nobility to trust less willingness to verbalize what they're doing. Ah… perhaps, more of a flat affect and inability to engage us freely in the player to be as spontaneous or to be having as much fun. Yeah, this closes for nighttime. Goodnight everybody. It's very interesting to see all the information that comes out I've had a couple of times very interesting situations where the kids sleep with one parent and the other parent sleeps somewhere else. And so right away, you know that there are something going on in the family. And so I'll just ask about that and come up with some interesting ah… ah… ah… situations that children describe. So the doll house is relevant because it's the context of the child. Sometimes, you want to have more than one doll house if the child's living for example in a foster home and there is a biological home and then you can look the differences, well what's it like here on your home and what's it like in this home? And what are the rules and how do you feel different and where do you spent most of your time and what activities do you do. uh… and the doll house doesn't have to be anything too fancy ah… when I was struggling and didn't have a lot of money to spend on toy materials. I would take shoe boxes and I would staple them together and make two and three story buildings sometimes and, and the kids would cut out windows. So sometimes, it can be actually a creative process where you can make something together with the child then I think that again supports the notion of mastery and self-esteem and things like that. 

00:34:10
NARRATOR In addition to art materials, sand trays, puppets and dollhouses. There are an array of other toys and materials that may help children to express their emotions. 

00:34:20
ELIANA GIL I think it with children who have been hurt, we also have to make sure there are props and tools that can give the child an opportunity for reparation. For example, doctor kits are very important, hospital kits are very important. The other notion, oh… and, and any other caretaking things like dishes and plates, so they can make food and feed the little dolls and create dinner scenarios ah… where families can get together and feed each other or be fed by others. All of this is real important. I also think of with hurt kids, something that has do with ah… shielding and guarding themselves, protecting themselves. So I like to have capes and masks and things that kids can get behind pillows. Um… so that they can feel some kind of cushion of safety. Sometimes when I'm talking to kids and there is something they wanna tell me but it's really difficult for them. The telephones work very nicely, because I can turn around with the phone and they can turn around. We're having contact, but it's with the cushion of safety that they need. So anything that has do with privacy um… is important for kids who have been abused or neglected. There is also one other additional thing that I have with kids who've been hurt, who go to court and that is a courtroom, ah… ah… set and that's something not so much because we need to rehearse what they're going to say ah… exactly in terms of testimony. But because it's important for them to see what it looks like and this is where you're gonna sit and the person who hurt you or allegedly who hurt you is gonna be over here and there's gonna be attorneys and those are grown ups and you'll have one on your table and there'll be one over here. Here is where jurors are gonna sit and just so that they can get a look what that looks like. I have had kids come back after going to court where they come in and, and they set up the courtroom and then they do something, they wish they could have done in the courtroom or they yell out something they wish, they had said or they're very proud of what they said and they wanna to tell me verbatim what they've just testified up at in court. So that's another component that I've introduced into the play therapy room with kids who've been abused that I think can be very useful to them. 

00:36:45
ELIANA GIL I cannot imagine a situation in which an abused child would not benefit from individual therapy. Their experience of victimization is painful, alarming and confusing enough to want(ph) speedy intervention. The individual therapy may be short term and may precipitate the need for family or group work. It's my belief that every abused child deserves the one-on-one experience with a trained professional as well as clinical attempts to ensure a safe environment for the child. 

00:37:20
ELIANA GIL Probably, the most important opportunity that we have when we have children come to us is to provide them with an environment that is safe and that accepts them and that encourages them and then facilitates them. We have to make sure that we both communicate this in our posture and in our tone and by the content of what we say. But we also have to make sure that we communicate this by creating physically an environment that is user friendly to children and that has the types of props and tools and games that are conducive to symbolic playing through. So that children have ample opportunity to demonstrate their concerns, their preoccupations, their joys um… the things they know about and feel good about as well as the things that they're confused by or that they just don't simply feel good about. And so to create opportunities for them I think is probably the most important gift that we have to offer and it's our responsibility as well as our privilege. It's neat.
