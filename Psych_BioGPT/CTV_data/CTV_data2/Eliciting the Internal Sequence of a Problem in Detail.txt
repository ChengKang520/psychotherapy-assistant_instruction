Eliciting the Internal Sequence 

00:00:40
of a Problem in Detail 

00:00:40
Steve Andreas, MA 

00:00:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Lisa, I have not met before, but we just talked and I gave an opening description of what I would be offering her and that is that I will be exploring the sequence of events that goes through her mind during a problem and I'll be offering ways to ameliorate it or make it better if I can, but I'm not gonna guarantee that those will work. What I can guarantee that she'll learn more about the sequence of what goes on when she has a problem. And so, my opening frame goes like this. You'd probably like a break from this problem, wouldn't you? 

00:01:15
LISA I would like a break from the problem 

00:01:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now, let's say I had to fill in for you for a day. How would I have your problem? What would I do? What would I notice in the world around me? How would I think about it? What would I talk to myself about it -- 

00:01:35
LISA Okay, you would -- 

00:01:35
STEVE ANDREAS Feelings that I would have and stuff like that. 

00:01:35
LISA Sure, yeah you would notice that no one has picked up any of their stuff. 

00:01:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So it's a bunch of litter around. 

00:01:40
LISA A bunch of litter. Toys -- 

00:01:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:01:45
LISA Shoes, socks, things that have been opened and not closed. 

00:01:50
STEVE ANDREAS I got it. 

00:01:50
LISA Okay. 

00:01:50
STEVE ANDREAS That's enough. 

00:01:50
STEVE ANDREAS I can fill in the blanks. 

00:01:55
LISA Alright. 

00:01:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So you notice this -- the clutter around you? 

00:02:00
LISA Right. 

00:02:00
STEVE ANDREAS I would have to notice the clutter around you, around me -- 

00:02:00
LISA Right. 

00:02:00
STEVE ANDREAS And then what would I do? 

00:02:05
LISA You would say to yourself "God damn it, why can't anybody pick up that themselves?" 

00:02:10
STEVE ANDREAS Oh! that's a great one. Now, this is gonna be a real short one. Luckily, we have a second volunteer and then we can get some more. 

00:02:15
LISA I said it was an easier problem. 

00:02:15
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Oh! I didn't hear that. Ah! okay. So, that's a good tonality too, right. "God damn it, why can't people pick up after themselves?" Now, once you've said that, you're in the soup, right? 

00:02:30
LISA Yes. 

00:02:30
STEVE ANDREAS I mean forget it after that. 

00:02:30
LISA That's it. 

00:02:30
STEVE ANDREAS After that it's just the detritus falling down the cliff -- 

00:02:35
LISA That's right. 

00:02:35
STEVE ANDREAS -- or something like that. 

00:02:35
LISA My body language takes on a different -- 

00:02:40
STEVE ANDREAS Everything is ruined after that? 

00:02:40
LISA Yes. 

00:02:40
STEVE ANDREAS And this is one of the principles of this that you try and find the first time something goes wrong, 'cos there's no harm in looking around at the litter, right? 

00:02:50
LISA Right. 

00:02:50
STEVE ANDREAS Accept that, then you say, "God, why can't anybody clean it up?" 

00:02:55
LISA Right. Especially at certain times of the month. 

00:02:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:02:55
LISA Right. 

00:03:00
STEVE ANDREAS Well, our thresholds change with our physiology, don't they? 

00:03:05
LISA Yeah. 

00:03:05
STEVE ANDREAS Guys have this too. It's a little different, but, okay, now, you understand that as soon as you say that to yourself, you're lost. Right? 

00:03:15
LISA Yeah. 

00:03:15
STEVE ANDREAS So what else could you just say? Or what else could I say? 

00:03:20
LISA I could say, you know what, I'd rather sit down and look at this magazine and pick up this stuff. 

00:03:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And if you did that, would that be satisfactory? 

00:03:30
LISA I think it would. 

00:03:30
STEVE ANDREAS Try it out in your imagination. Close your eyes. 

00:03:35
LISA Okay. 

00:03:35
STEVE ANDREAS And you see all litter lying around, and you say to yourself, "I'd rather just sit down and read a magazine." 

00:03:45
[sil.] 

00:03:55
STEVE ANDREAS Did that work for you? 

00:03:55
LISA Hmm, hmm 

00:03:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well, this is too -- like you say, I didn't realize you said it was too easy. This is too easy. Is there something else we could do? 

00:04:05
LISA  Something else I can do rather than read the magazine. 

00:04:10
STEVE ANDREAS Well, as more thinking of some other problem that you might have, 'cos that one's resolved, it sounds to me. 

00:04:15
LISA It's probably, it's probably resolved. 

00:04:20
STEVE ANDREAS Now, the litter is still there. 

00:04:20
LISA Right. 

00:04:25
STEVE ANDREAS But if you just sit -- I mean, there are plenty of people in this world who sit around, reading magazines and you know those beer cans and all kinds of stuff all over the place. Right? 

00:04:30
LISA That's right. 

00:04:30
STEVE ANDREAS And they're totally cool with it. 

00:04:35
LISA Right. 

00:04:35
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:04:35
LISA Yeah. 

00:04:35
STEVE ANDREAS You might not be. 

00:04:35
LISA Right. No, I like -- the truth is that I like a pretty organized environment. 

00:04:45
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:04:45
LISA So -- in any environment, but it takes a lot of time and investment to -- it takes more time to teach someone else how to pick up an environment and discipline than it does for me to just do it. 

00:05:00
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. You have kids, right? 

00:05:00
LISA Yes. 

00:05:00
STEVE ANDREAS Yes. Well, this is one of the burdens we bear -- 

00:05:05
LISA Yes. 

00:05:05
STEVE ANDREAS -- as parents. 

00:05:05
LISA hmm, hmm 

00:05:05
STEVE ANDREAS Now, let me explore this a little further, because I have a hunch, fairly soon, you'd probably look around at the litter and again and go goddamn it again. 

00:05:15
LISA Yeah. 

00:05:15
STEVE ANDREAS Is that right? 

00:05:15
LISA I think probably it's true. 

00:05:15
STEVE ANDREAS So -- 

00:05:15
LISA Maybe, I would not be goddamn it, but I'd say, I have to pick it up. 

00:05:20
STEVE ANDREAS I have to pick it up. 

00:05:20
LISA Right. 

00:05:20
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Have to is never a good plan either, right? 

00:05:25
LISA No. 

00:05:25
STEVE ANDREAS 'cos as soon as you say you have to, what's the next words? 

00:05:30
LISA Goddamn it. 

00:05:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. I was more thinking I don't wanna. 

00:05:35
LISA Right. I don't, yes, that's what it is. I don't want to. 

00:05:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. The typical -- 

00:05:40
LISA I don't want to. Yes. 

00:05:40
STEVE ANDREAS The typical answer is to you gotta, is I don't wanna. 

00:05:45
LISA Right. 

00:05:45
STEVE ANDREAS Right? 

00:05:45
LISA Yes. 

00:05:45
STEVE ANDREAS The whole parent-child thing. Okay. Now, there is -- I am a practical problem solver, I am a guy, I have to do that. What if you just got a snow shovel and a big box, so you didn't really have to pickup stuff, you're just gonna scoop it all off against the wall and then throw it in the box, something like that. 

00:06:05
LISA I'd love to do that. 

00:06:05
STEVE ANDREAS Will that work for you? 

00:06:10
LISA Yeah. Great. 

00:06:10
STEVE ANDREAS It worked great for me in college. I had a very messy roommate and everything that he left around, I put in a box, we call it the CYOS box, Claim Your Own Shit. 

00:06:25
LISA You know I think that -- 

00:06:25
STEVE ANDREAS Now, sometimes the leftover pizza got in on top of a white shirt and things like that you know, it taught him pretty fast, pretty soon, he got real need. 

00:06:35
STEVE ANDREAS I did that in college too with the roommate who wouldn't wash her dishes, which I would just stack 'em up in a box. 

00:06:40
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Wonderful. We think alike. 

00:06:40
LISA Yes. 

00:06:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now, does that sound like something that would be useful to you? 

00:06:45
LISA Yeah. It would be, 'cos I like a need, but I really, it's a lot of work to put it all away, and if it was just in a box, then they say, "Where is my -- where is my dish? Look at the box. 

00:06:55
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Exactly. 

00:06:55
LISA Right. 

00:07:00
STEVE ANDREAS And you know what, that will tend to teach them to put it away. 

00:07:00
LISA Yeah. 

00:07:00
STEVE ANDREAS Because if they really want something and it's buried in the bottom of the box, that's gonna motivate them to put it away. 

00:07:10
LISA Yeah. 

00:07:10
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:07:10
LISA Yeah. 

00:07:10
STEVE ANDREAS Now, here's another possibility. Can you have a part of the house that's basically your's that you can keep neat, that you can keep orderly, and when there is all this litter all across the kitchen and the living room or wherever it is -- 

00:07:30
LISA Right. 

00:07:30
STEVE ANDREAS -- then you can simply go away from that and read your magazine or whatever. 

00:07:35
LISA I kind of wish I did and I've tried to create that, but I have a fairly small house and a husband who's really in to sharing, everything is shared and I have to lock the bathroom door to keep him out. So, that's the culture of the -- that was the culture that have developed. 

00:07:50
STEVE ANDREAS The Cam(ph) family that pees together. 

00:07:55
LISA Exactly. And I'm pretty over it. 

00:07:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:07:55
LISA Yeah. 

00:08:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well, you might think about educating him about your need for your own private space or something like that. 

00:08:05
LISA Yeah. 

00:08:05
STEVE ANDREAS If that's important to you. 

00:08:05
LISA Yes. 

00:08:05
STEVE ANDREAS All of this is predicated on what works for you and I'm just offering some--. 

00:08:15
LISA Right. 

00:08:15
STEVE ANDREAS possibilities and stuff. 

00:08:15
LISA Yeah. Well, its more of a priority that I can ask for that, because I had bought in to a lot of the culture by husband that we created and that some what he created, and now I'm changing about what I want -- 

00:08:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. And you can still be with him in the bathroom or some other place like that, but --. 

00:08:35
LISA Right. 

00:08:35
STEVE ANDREAS Whatever. 

00:08:35
LISA Right. 

00:08:35
STEVE ANDREAS I mean, you need to work it out in terms of you and him and your desires and all the rest of it. 

00:08:40
LISA Right. 

00:08:40
STEVE ANDREAS But if you had some little corner or some little space or maybe your bedroom is off limits for the kids, most of the times --. 

00:08:50
LISA Right. 

00:08:50
STEVE ANDREAS -- that they don't -- not in their throwing their legos all over around it, whatever it is. 

00:08:50
LISA Right. 

00:08:50
STEVE ANDREAS So that you could simply just go away from the litter for a while you know and use the snow shovel later. 

00:09:00
LISA Right. 

00:09:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:09:00
LISA Right. I mean, it's a small problem, but my husband's in the salvage business. 

00:09:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:09:10
LISA So it -- 

00:09:10
STEVE ANDREAS He is a junk artist. 

00:09:10
LISA Yes. He is a junk -- I mean, we have 10,000 square foot warehouse and 30,000 square feet of yard -- outside space and architectural salvage and it's like Sanford and Son. 

00:09:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:09:25
LISA But you know so that's the kind of culture of the family. 

00:09:25
STEVE ANDREAS Mindset. 

00:09:25
LISA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:09:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well, what do you think? Is this going to work for you? 

00:09:35
LISA I think I love this box idea and I had done it in college and it worked and she got a little mad I remember about me putting her dirty dishes. 

00:09:45
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:09:45
LISA But -- 

00:09:45
STEVE ANDREAS The kids will probably get a little pissed off sometimes --. 

00:09:50
LISA Yeah. 

00:09:50
STEVE ANDREAS -- 'cos they don't know where their good stuff is. 

00:09:50
LISA Right. 

00:09:50
STEVE ANDREAS And all I have to do is say, "Well, you know if--" and you can do it in a nice tonality. "If you put it away, then you'll know where it is." 

00:10:00
LISA Right. 

00:10:00
STEVE ANDREAS And that make me a start on motivating them to take over some of the cleanup stuff. 

00:10:05
LISA Right. Right. 

00:10:05
STEVE ANDREAS Now, let's say you saw the clutter and you really wanted to express your dislike for it, how could you do it otherwise than saying goddamn it, that whole thing? 

00:10:20
LISA Well, most of the time I can't express it in a pretty decent way, except at certain times of the month and I can -- and it really makes me feel common side to have an environment that -- to my husband mostly and I'd like him to help me, you know help me and motivate the children and supervise. 

00:10:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So you might need to have some conversations with your husband. But is that something you do already? 

00:10:45
LISA Hmm, hmm. 

00:10:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Great. So that's not messing. 

00:10:50
LISA No. 

00:10:50
STEVE ANDREAS Well, I just need -- I'd like to do it more consistently. 

00:10:55
STEVE ANDREAS The talking or the getting help? What is it that you want to be? 

00:11:00
LISA Probably getting help and listening help in a positive way. 

00:11:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Great. Now, do you have a way to do that with your husband? 

00:11:10
LISA As long as I don't let it get too far and that I reach a frustration level, which I think taking a thing, I don't have to deal with it will help like I'll read the magazine first -- 

00:11:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Yeah. 

00:11:15
LISA -- and take care of me first. 

00:11:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And put him -- you can put him in charge of the snow shovel too. 

00:11:20
LISA Right. Yeah. 

00:11:25
STEVE ANDREAS Alright? 

00:11:25
LISA I could. 

00:11:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:11:25
LISA He's in charge of it right now along with the kids. 

00:11:25
STEVE ANDREAS Great. 

00:11:30
LISA We'll see. 

00:11:30
STEVE ANDREAS Now, what I had more in mind to something else. How could you get him to want to help you? Just have a good friend who taught me long ago with her son. Her son would ask her for something and she would say "Can you make me want to?" So, how could you make him want to help you clean up. You know it could be the same old, well, I think, I forgot what it's called now, reward, you know the operant conditioning kind of thing. 

00:12:05
LISA Right. 

00:12:05
STEVE ANDREAS How could you lure him in to helping you out? 

00:12:15
LISA I lured him -- 

00:12:15
STEVE ANDREAS You know like stroke the inside of his thigh or something like that. So, have a TASA agent, I'm gonna give you a good time. 

00:12:20
STEVE ANDREAS  I think that might work, but I think that really to being calm enough to tell him that he wants to please me, he does. And if not, because he is a junk man, he's a literally -- it doesn't -- the stuff --. 

00:12:45
STEVE ANDREAS He's got -- he's used to it. 

00:12:45
LISA That it absolutely had no impact on him. 

00:12:45
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Well, let's explore this just a little bit. 

00:12:50
LISA Okay. 

00:12:50
STEVE ANDREAS So, I will think for a moment here. When you -- let's do this, close your eyes. Imagine it's the wrong time of the month, you're already frustrated, there is litter all over the place, and notice how you feel in your body, is it easy for you under these circumstances to just say whatever you would say to your husband, "Hi honey, would you help me clean up really at the end of my rope or something like that?" 

00:13:30
LISA Is it easy? 

00:13:30
STEVE ANDREAS It is easy? 

00:13:30
LISA No. 

00:13:30
STEVE ANDREAS Not easy. What could we do to make it easy? 

00:13:35
LISA Well, I feel even thinking about it, I feel -- oops! sorry, tension in my head --. 

00:13:45
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:13:45
LISA And so I felt that even thinking about how I would feel. 

00:13:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:13:50
STEVE ANDREAS Now, how did you get to the tension in your head? 

00:13:55
LISA I think I just felt my inside kind of squashing up, yeah. 

00:14:00
STEVE ANDREAS Crunch up? okay. And what happened just before that? 

00:14:05
LISA I thought about what the house looked like and that I had an expectation that someone would do something without me telling them to do it. 

00:14:15
STEVE ANDREAS Oh, they had an obligation. Yeah. Well, that's what I was trying to get out with the luring thing, 'cos obligations typically don't work for you well. People don't like obligations. I mean, do you like obligations generically? Most people, don't. 

00:14:30
LISA Yeah. 

00:14:35
STEVE ANDREAS But if it's something that's freely offered or freely given or -- "Hey, would you do this for-- " A request rather than an obligation, people then generally respond better, okay. So, you saw the clutter, in your mind, you saw the clutter and you are -- and just before that, you had this sense of the obligation, I wish people would basically do what they should. Is that a fair summary? 

00:15:05
LISA Yeah. 

00:15:05
STEVE ANDREAS Short form? Telegraph? Okay. Now, again I get back to the luring thing, rather than they should, rather than -- it's a deal, you made a deal, come on, you should do it, which is not likely to lead to good feelings for you or for the other -- for your husband for instance or for the kids. How could you lure him into helping or lure the kids into helping? You don't have to tell me the details. 

00:15:35
LISA Right. I mean, I think on the one hand, I get the -- I think about how I can do this, get a haircut, and you're more sexually attracted to me if you take care of your hair. 

00:15:50
STEVE ANDREAS So he has got a hair like a junkyard. 

00:15:50
LISA He does at times. Yeah, at the time -- and he immediately went out and got his hair cut. 

00:15:55
STEVE ANDREAS Great. So you know how to do it? 

00:16:00
LISA Yeah. But I don't know if it's okay to you. 

00:16:05
STEVE ANDREAS Why not? 

00:16:05
LISA It seems manipulative. 

00:16:10
STEVE ANDREAS Well. There was no jewels fire for cartoon long ago. And said, couple are together and say, they said something like, "We're using each other." The next come back is, "Of course we're using each other." What else is using for? Well, here is the thing. I wouldn't want you to do anything with your husband that he didn't like. But if you do something and you have some way of making him smile or making him -- and you know you've got all these ways of -- you know his buttons went out, how long have you been together. 

00:16:55
LISA Since I was 19, I'm 42. 

00:16:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So you know what buttons he's got, you can push certain buttons and you'll go ballistic, right? 

00:17:05
LISA For him ballistic, he is a pretty calm guy. Yeah. 

00:17:05
STEVE ANDREAS Well, for you -- whatever. 

00:17:10
LISA Yeah, I mean like -- yeah. 

00:17:10
STEVE ANDREAS Well, you got buttons the other way too. And so you can call it manipulation. Now as far as I'm concerned, the word manipulation in the bad sense is when you get somebody else to do something that they really don't wanna do and they will -- or that'll harm them or something like that, sales manipulation, you get somebody to buy something that they don't need and they don't want and they won't enjoy. 

00:17:35
LISA Right. Right. 

00:17:35
STEVE ANDREAS But in terms of manipulation to the other -- to me the other meaning of the word is just do whatever works to have the free exchange and I'm sure you have lots of ways of getting a refection or -- 

00:17:50
LISA Right. 

00:17:50
STEVE ANDREAS Whatever, you know. And that involves your tone of voice and the way you behave and if you get scranched up, it's not going to work very well. 

00:18:00
LISA Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:00
STEVE ANDREAS Because when you're scranched up, almost everything you do will get poisoned, right? 

00:18:05
LISA Yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. 

00:18:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:18:05
LISA Definitely. 

00:18:10
STEVE ANDREAS So what could you say to yourself when you are in wrong time of the month, you're tired, end of the day, and you see all these clutter and you'd like to get it cleaned up, what can you say to yourself to be more useful than I wish everybody would do their job around here or whatever it is. 

00:18:30
LISA Someone is gonna help me. 

00:18:30
STEVE ANDREAS Someone is gonna help me. 

00:18:30
LISA Right. 

00:18:30
STEVE ANDREAS Great. How about, how can I get somebody to help me? 

00:18:35
LISA Okay. 

00:18:35
STEVE ANDREAS Because that's a little more directed. 

00:18:35
LISA Right. 

00:18:35
STEVE ANDREAS Right? 

00:18:35
LISA Right. 

00:18:40
STEVE ANDREAS And can you say to yourself in a nice seductive tone of voice? 

00:18:45
LISA How, seductive? 

00:18:45
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. To yourself. 

00:18:45
LISA Oh! to myself. 

00:18:45
STEVE ANDREAS Just internally. 

00:18:45
LISA Okay. It's hard to be -- 

00:18:50
STEVE ANDREAS -- or excited or something that's fun. "Hey, how can I get these guys to clean up all these junk?" 

00:19:00
LISA Okay. 

00:19:00
STEVE ANDREAS Now, as soon as you say that, can you start imagining ways that you could get them all collected. "Hey, we're gonna have pizza tonight, but we got to have things clean before we have pizza" or something like that. I mean, bribery works, right. 

00:19:15
LISA Right, right. 

00:19:15
STEVE ANDREAS And again as long as it's not a substitute for love or a substitute for connection, but it's part of your interaction and you get goodies from your husband, your husband gets goodies from you and likewise your kids and so on. 

00:19:30
LISA Right. 

00:19:30
STEVE ANDREAS Is that okay with you? Can you think of a lot of ways to do that? 

00:19:35
LISA I can't, 'cos I did it when they were little. And I did it in a really positive way when they were little. I think I had the expectation that somehow it would stick. And that it wouldn't require years of maintenance. But I think that's at the -- 

00:19:55
STEVE ANDREAS It might or it might not eventually. 

00:19:55
LISA Right. 

00:19:55
STEVE ANDREAS And one of the things my wife and I did when our kids were growing up is the kid's room they could do whatever they wanted as long as -- 

00:20:00
LISA Right. 

00:20:00
STEVE ANDREAS it wasn't -- doesn't breed disease or something like that you know -- 

00:20:05
LISA Okay. 

00:20:05
STEVE ANDREAS As long as that, the kid's room they can have mess, whatever, that was up to them. 

00:20:10
LISA Right. 

00:20:10
STEVE ANDREAS But the common area we wanted it nice, so we got the collaboration on that in that way. 

00:20:15
LISA Right. 

00:20:20
STEVE ANDREAS And it can always point -- good to point out that kind of thing, "Hey, you guys get totally freedom, mess up your bed, you can mess up your thing, you can paint on the walls or whatever your limits are -- 

00:20:30
LISA Right. 

00:20:30
STEVE ANDREAS Here by implication, it means not here -- 

00:20:35
LISA Right, right 

00:20:40
STEVE ANDREAS So run the scenario again, close your eyes. 

00:20:40
LISA Okay. 

00:20:40
STEVE ANDREAS And let's double check this. I always like to test how things work, 'cos earlier it didn't work as you said, "Oh! everybody should do stuff." something like that. So, it's the wrong time of the month, it's late in the day, you're tired, you're looking around at all the clutter, and all the mess and it's 3 feet deep, you think to yourself, "Hmmm, how can I get these guys to help?" Or something like that. You can always edit and you can always re-edit, just start thinking of things to do. That would be fun for you as well as enticing or luring or in some way get them to help you out. When you are on that scenario, what is it like for you? 

00:21:35
LISA I come up with different solutions I didn't feel so irritated by -- 

00:21:40
STEVE ANDREAS What was that? 

00:21:40
LISA I came up with different solution, a couple of different ways of doing it which that I kind of, I did when they were little too, so -- 

00:21:45
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Okay, I recommended that in your spare time, you pick up another hundred scenarios of what else you could do -- 

00:22:00
LISA Right. 

00:22:00
STEVE ANDREAS Because the first one might not work, second one might not work, third one might not work -- 

00:22:05
LISA Right. 

00:22:05
STEVE ANDREAS -- but if you got a whole bunch of those in there -- 

00:22:05
LISA Right. 

00:22:10
STEVE ANDREAS Then you won't come up short. 

00:22:10
LISA Right. 

00:22:10
STEVE ANDREAS And have to go back to the old thing. 

00:22:15
LISA I like the box idea. 

00:22:15
STEVE ANDREAS The box? 

00:22:15
LISA Yes. 

00:22:15
STEVE ANDREAS I think the box is real simple. 

00:22:20
LISA Right. 

00:22:20
STEVE ANDREAS And literally, you can get a plastic snow shovel and it will scrape up everything off the carpet and everything -- 

00:22:25
LISA Right. 

00:22:25
STEVE ANDREAS And you just dump it up. 

00:22:25
LISA Right, yeah. 

00:22:25
STEVE ANDREAS Maybe pull out the pizza first and -- 

00:22:30
LISA Right. 

00:22:30
STEVE ANDREAS And half opened bottle of coke first -- something like that. 

00:22:35
LISA Great. 

00:22:35
STEVE ANDREAS But then just shovel it all in, do you have anything else that can be used? 

00:22:40
LISA We'll let the next person come. 

00:22:45
STEVE ANDREAS Do you have any comments or -- 

00:22:45
LISA Oh! it does helps being out -- one of the things that I -- because it's such a small problem, I've --even though it causes me distress, I just try to kind of push it out of the way, rather than and cling on to my belief that I shouldn't have to do this. That's what I realize, that's what I realized that I was holding on to that. 

00:23:10
STEVE ANDREAS I agree you shouldn't have to deal with this. 

00:23:10
LISA Right. 

00:23:10
STEVE ANDREAS But you know what? 

00:23:15
LISA It's life. 

00:23:15
STEVE ANDREAS Exactly. 

00:23:15
LISA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:23:15
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:23:20
LISA Right. 

00:23:20
STEVE ANDREAS I thought it would be wonderful if everyone would always love me, but didn't work. 

00:23:25
LISA Right, yeah, right. 

00:23:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well, do you have any comments? 

00:23:30
LISA No. 

00:23:30
STEVE ANDREAS Would it be all right if these folks ask you question or two? 

00:23:30
LISA Sure. Yeah. 

00:23:35
STEVE ANDREAS As long as you have complete freedom to not answer if you'd rather not. 

00:23:35
LISA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:23:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Are there any questions? It's pretty straightforward, so there may not be any questions, there is a mic back there, well, I think we're done. 

00:23:45
LISA Okay, good. 

00:23:45
STEVE ANDREAS And luckily I lined up a second volunteer, where is she? Thanks, a lot. Are you coming? Yes. Let's take of your batch 'cos sometimes the camera doesn't like it. 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:15
STEVE ANDREAS And then this goes on from the back, like that, like glasses, right, like that, great. And your name, I've forgotten. 

00:24:20
JANET It's Janet. 

00:24:20
STEVE ANDREAS Janet? 

00:24:25
JANET Janet. 

00:24:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:24:25
JANET Testing 1,2,3 can you hear, yeah. 

00:24:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, I think you're on. 

00:24:30
JANET Right. 

00:24:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, what have you got for me? 

00:24:35
JANET Well, I have a hard time throwing things away. 

00:24:40
STEVE ANDREAS Hard time, oh good. Hard time in throwing things away. 

00:24:40
JANET Yes. 

00:24:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. You're one of these people where you walk through the kitchen and there are piles of newspapers on both sides things like that. 

00:24:45
JANET It's not quite that bad. 

00:24:50
STEVE ANDREAS It's not quite that bad. 

00:24:50
JANET No. 

00:24:50
STEVE ANDREAS Do you save bits of string too small to use? 

00:24:50
JANET No, no it's not that way. 

00:24:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, okay, how bad is it. 

00:25:00
JANET It's starting to get worse because my husband would use -- what he would do is he just pick things up and take it away and for a number of the things that I kept, I didn't really notice what he had taken and put away. And besides, I didn't have the energy to go through it myself. So I thought -- 

00:25:15
STEVE ANDREAS So he's taken a bunch of your stuff and put it away or thrown it away? 

00:25:20
JANET Books to the library, it centers a lot around books. 

00:25:25
STEVE ANDREAS Centers around books? 

00:25:25
JANET Yeah. 

00:25:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so you have lot of books in the house? 

00:25:30
JANET Books and pictures. 

00:25:30
STEVE ANDREAS Magazines, pictures? 

00:25:30
JANET Not so much magazines. 

00:25:35
STEVE ANDREAS You don't save old milk cartons? 

00:25:35
STEVE ANDREAS No. unless they're really good. 

00:25:40
STEVE ANDREAS Your problem is too easy. Okay, So what would like to have happened? I'm going a little different track here than I promised initially, but I think -- 

00:25:50
JANET And one of the reasons that it's causing me stress is in a couple of places not only at home, but at work, because I'm gonna very retiring in probably about eight months. 

00:26:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:26:00
JANET And so particularly on the office. 

00:26:00
STEVE ANDREAS So everything from the office is going to end up in your house. 

00:26:05
JANET Yeah. 

00:26:05
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, okay. 

00:26:05
JANET Yeah. 

00:26:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:26:10
JANET And I did that once when my office was painted and redone and that stuff is still in box, hasn't gotten back to my office. 

00:26:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So what would you like to -- this doesn't sound like serious wording, but you like to clean out the clutter? 

00:26:30
JANET Yeah and I -- 

00:26:30
STEVE ANDREAS When you start to clean out, how do you -- do you clean out the clutter at all, I mean some people don't at all. 

00:26:35
JANET From time to time, I do, yeah. 

00:26:40
STEVE ANDREAS How do you do it? 

00:26:40
JANET I -- I'll just focus on a small area and then that usually at some external event that causes me to do that. 

00:26:50
STEVE ANDREAS Relatives coming over. 

00:26:55
JANET Yeah. Somebody coming over or having company something like that and I really would like to just sort of have this internalized characteristic of being a little tidier. 

00:27:05
STEVE ANDREAS Well, you can just invite people over more often. 

00:27:10
JANET Actually, we do a lot of that. 

00:27:10
STEVE ANDREAS I mean seriously, this is a this is a potential solution, some of these things are just too simple, if you just invite people over every day, then you tend to clean up more, right? 

00:27:25
JANET Well, I don't -- that wouldn't be a good solution. 

00:27:25
STEVE ANDREAS That would be not a good -- 

00:27:25
JANET It will be exhausting. 

00:27:30
STEVE ANDREAS Good. Okay. Now, when people clean up usually they take up and it's good to take a limited piece of the stuff, the clutter, because that limits the -- makes the problem smaller, right? Now what a lot of people do is they look at the stuff and they're trying to decide where the things belong and what they wanna keep and what they wanna throw away? 

00:27:55
JANET Yeah. 

00:27:55
STEVE ANDREAS I recommend the reverse of that. I recommend that you take a certain amount of clutter and put it in a box somewhere or lay it out on a carpet or something like that and then pick through for what you want to keep. Do you understand that's different than what you want to throw away? 

00:28:20
JANET Hmmm, yeah. 

00:28:20
STEVE ANDREAS What you want to throw away requires negation. I don't want that. I don't use this. This won't be good, whatever. And if you spread it all out and you look and say, "Well, what do I want to keep?" This is more like the normal thing that you do when you look around in a grocery store, what do I wanna buy? not what do I don't wanna buy, but what do I wanna buy and so then you can pick out whatever it is you want and then shove the rest in the garbage, or give it to the goodwill or whatever or a little of both. If you imagine doing that in your mind -- close your eyes for a minute, imagine doing that in your mind, find out if that works for you and if so how well it works for you? 

00:29:05
JANET I can do that with some things, but there are other things I can't do that with. 

00:29:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. What are the things you can't do that with? 

00:29:15
JANET Books. 

00:29:15
STEVE ANDREAS Books. Okay. You got to keep 'em all? 

00:29:15
JANET Yeah. It's really hard for me to throw books away. 

00:29:20
STEVE ANDREAS How about give them away. To a good will or a library or a -- 

00:29:25
JANET That's hard to do too. I can do that and I have done that, but that's hard to do. 

00:29:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And what makes it hard, close your eyes and look at some books somewhere in the table or your bedside or wherever you put your books and look at them and tell me what makes it difficult depart with them? Do books have some kind of special meaning for you? 

00:29:50
JANET Well, I have a lot of books and some I haven't read and so I'm going to get to those. 

00:30:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So those you would -- that's a good reason for keeping them. How about the others? 

00:30:05
JANET There's -- 

00:30:05
STEVE ANDREAS How about the ones you've read? 

00:30:05
JANET Pardon me. 

00:30:05
STEVE ANDREAS How about the ones you've read? 

00:30:10
JANET Some of those I'd like to keep, because I like to reread 'em, because I like them so much. 

00:30:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well you can build a lot of book shelves. 

00:30:25
JANET We have a lot of book shelves. 

00:30:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well you know it's your life and your values and your -- you know what's important to you? But given that you would like to clear out some of these things. I mean maybe you want to keep all of your books. 

00:30:40
JANET No, no. My husband's comment is that we have to get rid of some. 

00:30:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well, you don't have to do everything your husband wants you to do? 

00:30:55
JANET Oh! that's a good point. And I have stood my ground on some things. 

00:31:00
STEVE ANDREAS You could, some of these, how many books do you have, do you think? Thousand, two thousand? 

00:31:05
JANET No. No. Not that many, maybe maybe four or five hundred. 

00:31:10
STEVE ANDREAS Four or five hundred. Okay, well, if you got a basement or some shed out back, you could build some more bookshelves and stuck them out -- and stick them out there. They wouldn't be in your way, you could alphabetize them, you can even do decimal if you wanted to. 

00:31:25
JANET Don't really have the space for them. 

00:31:30
STEVE ANDREAS What's that? 

00:31:30
JANET Don't really, don't really have space for them and I have kind of filled up all those spaces. 

00:31:35
STEVE ANDREAS How about renting a used store up? 

00:31:35
JANET No. 

00:31:40
STEVE ANDREAS You don't wanna do that? 

00:31:40
JANET No. I don't want to rent, I don't want to rent. 

00:31:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. It will be money, wouldn't it? 

00:31:45
JANET Yeah. There is a kind of ethical thing like, we build places to store our stuff, but people don't have houses to live in. So, that's kind of an ethic thing for me. 

00:31:55
STEVE ANDREAS People don't have books to read either? 

00:32:00
JANET Oh that's, ah-- 

00:32:00
STEVE ANDREAS Your thought of that? 

00:32:05
JANET No. 

00:32:05
STEVE ANDREAS If you could know that your books were going to some place where they would be valued and used like the house, like the storage. Would that make any difference to you? 

00:32:20
JANET Yeah. That would make a lot a difference. 

00:32:25
STEVE ANDREAS Is that would satisfy your values about not wasting things. 

00:32:25
JANET Right. 

00:32:30
STEVE ANDREAS Right? Do you think you could find out places and this -- you know the range of possibilities is almost endless. Things are going digital, so lot of book are just turning out. 

00:32:35
JANET Redundant. 

00:32:40
STEVE ANDREAS A lot of 'em are redundant. But there are places it still need books, there are still libraries for children's books and things like that. And the libraries should have a real solid books rather than the e-books and so on. There are also people who send books to Africa and Solomon Islands and things like that where they really need something and they don't have all the electronic stuff. Can you think of some solution like that, that would make it easier for you to sort through and -- as I said before, spread out a bunch of books on a table or something like that and then pick out the ones that you really wanna save, that you really -- you think you'll read in the next 20 years or something like that, that you really might read, not that you might read someday. 

00:33:25
JANET Great, but some yeah. 

00:33:25
STEVE ANDREAS But seriously the ones that you would want to keep and then think of, where are these -- the rest of these could go that would be good for you. Satisfy your husband to get him out of the house and also satisfy you that they were going somewhere useful. 

00:33:45
JANET And I think that's really a piece of it, some place that they would be useful, because some of the books have memories. Some of them and when you mentioned children's books are books that I read to my children. 

00:33:55
STEVE ANDREAS Keep a few of those. 

00:34:00
JANET Yeah. 

00:34:00
STEVE ANDREAS Keep a few of those as memories, but that's not true with all the books right? 

00:34:05
JANET No. 

00:34:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Keep, keep a half a dozen maybe of the books that you read to your kids and you can remember. Because they are wonderful, you can pull them off the shelf and settle your kids around you and they are small again. I do this and you know it is a real touchstone, like you can touch something and bring back memories that are satisfying and supportive and so on. 

00:34:35
JANET Yeah. And that's just really an excellent point, because to use that kind of a filter to look at other things that need to be paired, paired down. Because I have gotten to the age that we've collected a lot of stuff over time. It's our house is a pretty good size and we need to downsize. 

00:34:55
STEVE ANDREAS You stay in one place too long, you get a lot of clutter. 

00:35:00
JANET Yeah. 

00:35:00
STEVE ANDREAS And some of it's wonderful clutter, I've got a clutter desk, it's got all kinds of stuff, I love it. 

00:35:10
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, I do too. I have some very strange things, but I really can't bear parting with them. 

00:35:15
STEVE ANDREAS I love strange things. I've got a little dish of dinosaur gizzard stones. Have you ever heard of those? 

00:35:20
JANET Yeah. 

00:35:20
STEVE ANDREAS Heard of those? Like chickens, the dinosaur swallowed rocks and then they got all polished and tumbled in. I love them. I think they are beautiful. They would worth nothing at all, but I couldn't sell them on eBay, but I love 'em. 

00:35:35
JANET I love rocks too. But now I have found a place for those, because they were stacking up too. 

00:35:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:35:40
JANET They were stacking up too. 

00:35:45
STEVE ANDREAS They were stacking up too. 

00:35:45
JANET Yeah. So I need to go through the same thing with my rocks as well. 

00:35:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now, so one of the criteria that could make it easy for you to do this, is to know that they were going in a place that they could be used. Right? Now, you can't always be sure that, sometimes you give something to a library and throwing 'em away. But you can do your best to place whatever it is you clear out in some place that satisfies that criteria. And I wonder if there is anything else that you can think of that would make it easier for you to let go some of these things. 

00:36:20
JANET Limiting the number that I have, like the children's book, I have a fair number of children's books, right? 

00:36:25
STEVE ANDREAS How many do you have do you think? 

00:36:25
JANET How many children's books? Oh! I don't know probably about 30, 35, maybe 40 children book. 

00:36:35
STEVE ANDREAS I got more than that. Maybe I should clear up my place. 

00:36:40
JANET Well and maybe the other thing is just to make a children's bookshelf. Because I have six grandchildren, and they come and they love to read the books too. 

00:36:45
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Then you could read them with them too. 

00:36:50
JANET Yeah. 

00:36:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now anything else? 

00:36:55
JANET That I can think of? 

00:36:55
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. To make it even easier for you to let go of them. I mean the one thing we picked up here is, that is you're sure that it can be used, so they are not wasted. That's an important criterion for you and it is for me too. I put almost nothing in the trash except old newspapers and empty milk cartons and things like that. I've been recycling a whole bunch of stuff, 'cos I want things to be used. So, I find places and people to give away things to and here is another possibility, I -- once in awhile, I have a what I call a giveaway, I take a bunch of things that I think are kind of neat, but I got too many of 'em and I put them all out on a table and I invite a whole bunch of friends over, and I ask them to pick out something that they would particularly like. And then I know that they're gonna pick up something they like, not just grab it or it's just not going to the goodwill and end up in the garbage. 

00:37:55
JANET That's a great idea? 

00:37:55
STEVE ANDREAS Does that appeal to you? 

00:37:55
JANET Yeah. That's a great idea. 

00:37:55
STEVE ANDREAS And you can make it a party, you know or a part of party. Should have some people over for dinner and then, "Oh! by the way I've got all the stuff, would you like to help yourself?" 

00:38:05
JANET Well, and we do that. I do that a little bit at Christmas, we can do a white elephant thing. 

00:38:10
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:38:10
JANET But, something -- 

00:38:10
STEVE ANDREAS This is even easier, you don't have to wrap 'em up. 

00:38:15
JANET Yeah. Yeah 

00:38:15
STEVE ANDREAS That's real quick stuff vanishes so fast and the stuff that doesn't vanish you can give away to goodwill. 

00:38:25
JANET Yeah. That's a great idea too. 

00:38:25
STEVE ANDREAS Now. I would like you to close your eyes for a minute and again do a little scenario, how you would actually go about doing this? When is the best time in your life to do this? So, a particular time of the day or particular day of the week that would be good to set up to start clearing out all these things. And just kind of imagine doing it the way we've talked about or you take a certain amount of stuff not everything, just certain amount and you spread it out. And you first pull back the things that you want and then you have a bunch of stuff left over, and then you figure out how can I -- maybe, even say to yourself. "How can I place these somewhere where someone will value them?" 

00:39:20
STEVE ANDREAS Well, that becomes another issue in terms of finding your time. 

00:39:25
JANET Okay. 

00:39:25
STEVE ANDREAS Finding time? 

00:39:25
STEVE ANDREAS Finding time. Yeah finding, finding your time. But I'm trying to stretch my mind, in terms of thinking. Maybe I just have to do it once a month. 

00:39:35
STEVE ANDREAS You're very busy? But you're gonna retire soon right? 

00:39:35
JANET Yeah, in eight months. 

00:39:40
STEVE ANDREAS Will you have -- you should have more time when you retire. Is that right? 

00:39:40
JANET Yeah. 

00:39:40
STEVE ANDREAS So, if can you -- you said six months? 

00:39:45
JANET Eight. 

00:39:45
STEVE ANDREAS Eight months. Okay, so close your eyes, eight months in to the future. Now, actually you talked about this stuff in the office too right? You might wanna start there right now. 

00:40:00
JANET Yeah. 

00:40:00
STEVE ANDREAS Right? Use that part of your work time to clean up the stuff, somebody's gonna to have to clean it out eventually. 

00:40:05
JANET Yeah. And it's a good idea to start at the office first, so with that just taking. 

00:40:15
STEVE ANDREAS What do you want to keep from your office? I wouldn't wanna keep anything from office wherever it is outside. I mean, you might have some personal things on your desk, but you're gonna bring records or anything? 

00:40:25
JANET No. No but I'm thinking about the next person coming in and what they might need? 

00:40:35
STEVE ANDREAS What they -- 

00:40:35
JANET What they might need. 

00:40:35
STEVE ANDREAS What they might need? Or you could just leave it all there, and then they can throw out what they don't want. 

00:40:40
JANET That seems a little cruel. 

00:40:45
STEVE ANDREAS That would be cruel? 

00:40:45
JANET That would be cruel. 

00:40:45
STEVE ANDREAS Cruel and unusual punishment? 

00:40:45
JANET Yes that would be cruel and unusual. 

00:40:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, but again can you use the same kind of criterion that you have five folders or writing pads and pencils and whatever like that. You could give them away to other people in your office or the adjoining office. I don't know where you work, but there must be other people around that you know who could use that kind of things. 

00:41:10
JANET It's probably going through the files is -- 

00:41:10
STEVE ANDREAS Going through files? 

00:41:10
JANET Going through files. Yeah. 

00:41:15
STEVE ANDREAS Why don't you just throw them out? What do you want to keep? 

00:41:20
JANET Well sometimes I've kept things that probably should have gone in the administrative files. So I just kind of can't blank at -- 

00:41:25
STEVE ANDREAS How about -- How about letting the administrator do that? Just say, I've got all my files here, you can have anything you want. 

00:41:35
JANET I am the administrator. 

00:41:35
STEVE ANDREAS You are the administrator? Okay. I was just putting in from one end into the other. 

00:41:45
JANET Yeah. That's great. 

00:41:50
STEVE ANDREAS So who would care if you throw away all the stuff? Would you care? Would anybody else care? 

00:41:55
JANET Probably not. The only thing that might be problematic if I hadn't put something in the administrative files that really should be there. But that's probably. 

00:42:10
STEVE ANDREAS Whose problem is that going to be? In eight months? 

00:42:15
JANET It would probably be the agency secretary's problem. 

00:42:20
STEVE ANDREAS What is it? 

00:42:20
JANET Probably be the agency secretary's problem. 

00:42:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well you could offer her then. If there is anything you need here is my files, pick out anything you want. 

00:42:35
JANET As she would have a good sense of what was in the administrative files and what wasn't? 

00:42:40
STEVE ANDREAS Well, then she won't be good at noticing what she doesn't have that she doesn't need? 

00:42:45
JANET Yeah. She wouldn't. 

00:42:45
STEVE ANDREAS She wouldn't? 

00:42:45
JANET Yeah. She would be good at noticing, whether, oh, I don't think I have this. She would be good at them. 

00:42:55
STEVE ANDREAS And whose problem would that be? 

00:42:55
JANET Ah! say that again. 

00:43:00
STEVE ANDREAS Whose problem would that be. If you threw out all those files, whose problem would it be that there is something missing? 

00:43:10
JANET They probably wouldn't know. 

00:43:10
STEVE ANDREAS What? 

00:43:10
JANET They probably wouldn't know. 

00:43:15
STEVE ANDREAS That's that I was getting at. That's what I was thinking. 

00:43:15
JANET Yeah. They probably wouldn't know. I tend to be rather over responsible. 

00:43:25
STEVE ANDREAS Could you be over responsible for yourself? 

00:43:30
[sil.] 

00:43:35
JANET It's hard to be over responsible for myself. 

00:43:35
STEVE ANDREAS I don't think it is possible. I think everybody should be totally responsible for themselves and do what they want and what they need and so on. I mean it's your life and I'm just trying to offer you know, a smorgasbord and you take whatever works for you and discard whatever doesn't work for you, but the burden of clutter I assume that you are familiar with. Is it a burden for you or maybe not? 

00:44:15
JANET Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is, because it, the clutter kind of -- I am not claustrophobic, but it-- it's just, I find that if I've got something that is cleaned up, I just -- I feel better and I function better. 

00:44:35
STEVE ANDREAS I do too. Now, some people don't, some people are quite happy with clutter. 

00:44:40
JANET And I, I think I tell myself I'm happy with the clutter, but yet when something is kind of straightened up and everything is ordered and put away, it's kind of like ahh. 

00:44:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Close your eyes. 

00:44:55
JANET Okay. 

00:44:55
STEVE ANDREAS Memorize that feeling, that ah! that relief, that pleasure at seeing things at least more or less in order. The freedom and openness or whatever -- however you would describe it for yourself. And however you picture it too, you can see the stuff in order right, okay? So you can see the stuff in order and then you have that nice feeling, right? Now, let's put that together with you cleaning out. So, whether you clean out stuff from the office or you clean out some stuff at home. As you see the stuff and you're beginning to pick out the things that you really want to keep, you imagine that clarity or the orderliness or however you would want to talk about it, and have that nice feeling of relief. 

00:45:55
[sil.] 

00:46:10
JANET That feels very nice. 

00:46:10
STEVE ANDREAS What's that? 

00:46:10
JANET I said, that feels very nice. 

00:46:10
STEVE ANDREAS Feel very nice, okay. Now as you do that, as you imagine taking a certain number of books and spreading 'em out and looking for what you want to keep, did that work for you, was it easy to keep going? 

00:46:25
JANET Yeah. 

00:46:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Great, that's what I am after. And I think that the image of the cleaned up section or whatever it is, the neatness, whatever you want to call it. 

00:46:40
JANET Clutter free. 

00:46:40
STEVE ANDREAS Clutter free? 

00:46:40
JANET Clutter free. 

00:46:40
STEVE ANDREAS Clutter free And that nice feeling can be a continual motivator to take one chunk at the time, one chunk at a time and just each time, you have that feeling at the end of it, you'll have that feeling, because certain number of things will be in a box to go to goodwill or to giveaway party or something like that. Now when you see that, I'm curious how do you see that, when you look at the books that is spread out to go through and I ask due to superimpose on it the -- somehow, the image of the clutter free. How do you actually see it in your mind? The number of ways to do it. 

00:47:30
JANET I'm not understanding. 

00:47:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well, there is a number of ways to do it. One is you can look at the clutter like that up here, you can see an image of the clutter free. 

00:47:35
JANET Okay. 

00:47:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay? And that works great for some people, 'cos they just kind of keep that image up there and then they can work and can do the cleanup and they have this image guiding them, pulling them forward. Another way to do it is to superimpose it on the clutter, on the stuff that you're working through. So the clutter free is like a transparency that you're looking through to see that. 

00:48:05
JANET Okay. Yeah. I think it would be easier-- it would work better to have like this clutter free picture that I am grooving towards. 

00:48:15
STEVE ANDREAS Great. And you like it right in front of you like that, right? 

00:48:15
JANET Yeah. Here is the clutter here and then just kind of right here. 

00:48:20
STEVE ANDREAS Right. I think that's a wonderful choice, and I just want to check up how you were doing it, because there are better ways and not so good ways to do it okay? So, close your eyes again and just run it through it one more time. Imagine it is next week and you have a little bit of time and you want to clean up the children's books for starters. So, you take the 30 or 35 books or something and spread 'em out and you have that picture of the clutter free right there in front of you, leading you forward. You pick out the ones that are special and you can remember really reading what the kids really liked or that you really enjoyed reading to the kids or something like that. Set those aside, and then do whatever you do with the ones that you're going to send on to greener pastures. And just check out how well it works, 'cos if it doesn't work well, we want to find out now and find out how we can tweak it a little bit to make it work for you. 

00:49:30
[sil.] 

00:49:35
JANET I think that would work. I would have to go several places. 

00:49:40
STEVE ANDREAS Several places? 

00:49:40
JANET Yeah. I would have to go on my attic and then I've got a bookshelf downstairs and a bookshelf 

00:49:45
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah sure. Where would you like to start? 

00:49:50
JANET Probably, the best place would be on the bookshelf where I would like to eventually keep 'em all. 

00:49:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Yeah cleanout space for what you want to keep. 

00:50:00
JANET Right. 

00:50:00
STEVE ANDREAS Right? 

00:50:00
JANET Right. 

00:50:00
STEVE ANDREAS That would be a double motivation right, okay. 

00:50:05
JANET Win win. It would be win-win. 

00:50:05
STEVE ANDREAS Win-win got it. I miss that, okay. 

00:50:10
JANET But I just have to stay really focused on that, because if I'm cleaning out another place sometimes I take a left turn and then I get involved with that and then I lose focus on that. 

00:50:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Yep. That's easy to do. Okay, one more rehearsal, so you're going to clean out this particular shelf where the kids books are now, and you want to make space so that whatever you keep you have a nice clean clutter free shelf to put those on. And you start to get distracted by something. What do you do? Can you stay on task, remember you got this picture here in front of you leading you on into the future of the clutter free. Do you have any problems staying on task? 

00:50:55
JANET I can -- I think, I can just say well if there is something, there are now, I'll just put that in a box and then maybe my next after I get done with that books, maybe the next task is the box. 

00:51:10
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Sounds good. Okay, well I think I'm done. Now, lemme just mention couple of other things that could be useful for you. Somebody else -- this is clutter day apparently and I don't know what title this video. My clutter, your clutter, our clutter. What it does is when you have a bunch of stuff, he didn't really thinks he doesn't want. He puts it in a garbage can, clean garbage can and if he doesn't want anything back out of that for the next week, he moves that down the line, he has three garbage cans in a row. The one at the end goes out to the garbage each week and then it comes over here and then it is empty to more stuff in. 

00:51:55
JANET Okay. 

00:51:55
STEVE ANDREAS And he just puts a whole bunch of stuff in there. This is a clearly radical solution and you may not want it. But it might stimulate your cerebral cortex or something like that or maybe your amygdala who knows. Excuse me -- 

00:52:10
JANET Or my cerebellum. 

00:52:10
STEVE ANDREAS anyway he puts a whole bunch of stuff in this garbage can. If it is there for a week and he hasn't used anything out of it or wanted anything out of it, he moves it down. This one moves down into this position and this one gets thrown out in the garbage. Now you may want to first pull out stuff that you are sure would be useful to somebody else, because of this criterion and you have a saving and not wasting things, which I totally agree with, but everything else could just go in a garbage can, if you don't want it in a week move it down. So it gets a week here, a week here, week here and then it goes out. That's for the stuff that probably isn't useful to anybody or nobody would want. 

00:53:00
JANET Right. Right. That seems kind of drastic, but what I, but what I can see is looking, I have this tub of stuff I don't know what to do, but they are -- I haven't gone through it for a while. So the thing to do would be go through the tub, figure out what's worth keeping that I want and take care of that and then look at what's worth it might be useful to somebody put that some place else and then what's left put in the garbage. 

00:53:35
STEVE ANDREAS Great. 

00:53:40
JANET Or give to somebody else. 

00:53:40
STEVE ANDREAS Sure, okay. Funnel out of the house. 

00:53:45
JANET Funnel it out of the house. Yeah. 

00:53:45
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Let me add one more thing I just thought of. Whenever you funnel something out of the house, could you have a nice pleasant sucking sound, is this? That doesn't ring a bell? 

00:54:05
JANET It isn't sucking sound, it's a blowing sound. 

00:54:15
STEVE ANDREAS Blowing sound? Oh! great. Okay, so that would work for you. 

00:54:15
JANET Yeah, and I think the blowing sound. 

00:54:20
STEVE ANDREAS So, the blowing sound. Good that could be kind of a nice reminder of what you're all about here is that when you blow that sound and if anytime you got distracted in terms of putting something else away, you found something behind the books on the shelf or where does that belong, you just set it aside and you hear that blowing sound blowing, close your eyes and do that, see if that adds anything good to it. 

00:54:45
JANET Yeah. It does. 

00:54:45
STEVE ANDREAS Good. 

00:54:45
JANET Because I just feel myself relaxing. 

00:54:50
STEVE ANDREAS Ah! great. Now, you might be able to tune this up even better than what we have done here, but do you understand what the principles of what I am doing here, try and make it easy for you, make it worthwhile, make it fit with your values and make it easy for you. And I've really -- I've done this with a lot of people and the difference between looking at a bunch of stuff and deciding what you want to throw away, and looking at a bunch of stuff and deciding what you want to keep is a world of difference. 

00:55:25
JANET Yeah. It really is. 

00:55:25
STEVE ANDREAS If you don't believe it, try it out. 

00:55:25
JANET Yeah. Yeah. Well, I can sense that. 

00:55:30
STEVE ANDREAS Because, it is just the normal thing we do. Typically, we look around and we go well what do I want, and that's much easier, it's much more natural, what do I don't want, you have to go through some mental gymnastics it's just a lot harder, but if you pretend like you're throwing it away and then you pull back what you want. 

00:55:45
JANET And I think, it would give me an opportunity to kind of pause to and -- I want this, why do I want this, what is the rationale for wanting it and does that really make sense? 

00:56:00
STEVE ANDREAS Well, you could do that. That might take a long time try it out in your imagination two ways. I am checking at time, here we're getting close. Close your eyes for a minute and try just looking at the books and just looking at which ones appeal to you and you pull those out, that's one option. Let me know when you have done that and then the other is you look through and you start thinking about, well, do I really want it and so on and so on and so on. I think the first might work a lot better. 

00:56:35
JANET Yes. That feels, that feels a lot better. 

00:56:40
STEVE ANDREAS I think it will work a lot better. 

00:56:40
JANET Thinking too much is -- 

00:56:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. I think -- this is where your unconscious mind can really be a help. You just look at the books, you look at the covers, the kids books and so on. Just look at them and see which ones pop out to you or more appealing or more colorful or whatever. And just pullout what works for you and don't go through a whole of bunch of thinking about it. I think it will work a lot better, I mean -- 

00:57:05
JANET Yeah it's too. 

00:57:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. It did in the little scenario, right? 

00:57:10
JANET Yeah, it did, absolutely. 

00:57:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now what we have done here or what we have done with you is to try and streamline your process a little bit and add in the difference between throwing stuff away and keeping stuff and things like that and adding in the blowing sound, because that works better for -- see if sucking would be better for me, if I hear a big sucking sound, and I think "Oh! boy, all I have to do is hold the stuff up and it's gonna go, go away." But if blowing works better for you, that's wonderful. Now, you could always jazz this up somehow in other ways. And you can always experiment with this and change what we've done if you want to. You could take that image of the non-clutter, look at it right now, close your eyes, what if you added some sparkles to it like they have on TV. Juice it up little bit, is it in color? 

00:58:10
JANET Actually what comes to mind is a nice little bookshelf. 

00:58:15
STEVE ANDREAS A nice little bookshelf? 

00:58:15
JANET Yeah, a nice tidy little bookshelf. 

00:58:15
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Now in that image of the bookshelf, can you add a few little sparkles or something like that. Would that make any difference in terms of making it more appealing. Now, you can always do more like this, you can always juice it up more by adding to that image something that makes sense to you or somehow it is appealing to you whatever. I am giving you a little license to experiment further that's all, okay? 

00:58:50
JANET It’s great. 

00:58:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. I think we are done. I think we're done with time too, but does anybody have a question or so? This isn't quite what I had in mind when I decided to do this, but the kind of -- I think particularly with the second example, you see a lot of things that are directly applicable to almost any problem your clients deal with. If you want to reprogram them to go in a different direction and do something that's more useful than what they are already doing, this shows how to do that. Find out what is the chain of events revamp the change, change pieces in the chain, change the flip from the throwing away to choosing or whatever it is that you think of doing, and you can literally build in a sort of a streamlined process to make life easy instead of difficult. I think we're out of time now, is that right? Okay, well thank you very much. 

00:59:50
JANET Well, thank you. 

00:59:55
STEVE ANDREAS And thank you all. 

00:59:55
