FACE-SPIRIT: A New Model for Integrating Spirituality into Counseling and Psychotherapy 

00:00:05
Where is God when I need help? 

00:00:10
How do I cope? 

00:00:15
Does God still care for me? 

00:00:15
What is the meaning of my life? 

00:00:20
Life asks us many questions that are difficult to answer, often the answers can only come from spiritual perspective, so why is this so seldom addressed in counseling and therapy and how can it be accomplished? 

00:00:35
Radha J. Horton-Parker, Ph. D., NCC, NCSC & R. Charles Fawcett, M.S.Ed., NCC Why, When, and How? Integrating Spirituality into Counseling and Therapy Why? 

00:00:35
Experts Radha J. Horton-Parker and Charles Fawcett are going to explore these issues in this video, which will address the why, when and how of integrating spirituality into counseling and therapy. 

00:00:50
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Ph. D., NCC For many years spirituality was not addressed in counseling and psychotherapy. In fact, therapists were trained to avoid discussing sensitive topics. Things such as religion or politics. We didn't discuss issues like that with our clients. These consensus has shifted in light of overwhelming data, demonstrating that spirituality is in a central component of wellness. Numerous studies have shown the spiritualities associated with decreased depression, suicidal ideation, alcohol and drug use. Spirituality is also correlated with increase substance use recovery rates and even increased marital satisfaction. 

00:01:35
Spirituality Is Associated With Decreased: Depression Suicidal Ideation Alcohol & Drug Use Spirituality Is Associated With Increased Substance Abuse Recovery Rates Marital Satisfaction 

00:01:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT M.S.Ed., NCC That's right Radha. As a matter of fact, studies in efficacy of prayer have also yield to remarkable findings. For example, a recent study focused on 219 women undergoing in vitro fertilization. In the double blind study, one-half of the women were prayed for and the other half were not. The group that was not prayed for showed the 26% pregnancy rate, while the women, who were prayed for demonstrated a 50% pregnancy rate. 

00:02:05
Gallup Poll 95% Believe in God 68% Members of a church or synagogue 55% Religion is very important 28% Religion is fairly important 65% Religion helps address problems in society 

00:02:05
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Those are amazing statistics. Clients as well as for researchers recognize that spirituality and mental health go together. After all according to a recent Gallup poll, 95% of Americans believe in God and 68% identify themselves as members of a church or synagogue, 55% report the religion is very important in their lives and 28% say that it is fairly important. Almost 65% believe that religion helps to address problems within society. So it should come as no surprise that many clients expect their spiritual and religious values to be addressed in counseling. 

00:02:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Finally, our professional and recruiting(ph) associations agree on the importance of spirituality. 

00:02:55
National Associations American Psychological Association Council on Social Work Education National Association of Social Workers American Counseling Association Association for Spiritual, Ethical, and Religious Values In Counseling Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs National Organization for Human Services 

00:02:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT The National associations that you seen in your screen now includes spirituality in their professional standards. They assume that helping professionals should be prepared to address spiritual issues with their clients. All these agencies have concluded that meeting a client spiritual needs is crucial in providing total care. Even medical schools have begun training their students to pray with their patients before doing surgery or other procedures if the patient so desires. The medical and scientific communities are now embracing spirituality in prayer and is evidence for therapeutic efficacy is abundant. However, to remains a strong anti-religious biased among some mental health professionals. Won't you agree Radha? 

00:03:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Absolutely. There are some in our professional who are very biased against religion and spirituality. In the opinion of many, however, such bias would be account to therapist saying that they don't believe in the value of anti-depressants and therefore will not recommend them for clients who might clearly benefit from their use. Despite the solid clinical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of drugs in treating depression. Would this be either a rational or ethical position to take? The ethical guidelines for therapist state that we must be unbiased in our work and do what's best for our client. Some clients can afford private religiously based counseling and so they will seek secular counseling through an agency, but these clients don't leave their spirituality at their door. They rightly expect their psychotherapist to honor their religious concerns and believes. On the other hand, it would be of course be absolutely unethical for therapist to impose their un-believes or spiritual practices on clients. 

00:04:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT It sounds like we’re in the midst of a real sea change in this area. 

00:04:50
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Yes. Thankfully contemporary counseling models such as those develop by maples and Myers, Witmer and Sweeney among others. Now shows spirituality to be an essential part if not the very core of mental health. Many therapists too recognized the tremendous value of spirituality in their own lives, as well as in those of their clients. At this point, not enough practical emphasis has been placed on the role of spirituality in therapist training. So mental health professionals who want to integrate spirituality into therapy are often at a loss regarding how to do so. They may not consider themselves informed enough to feel comfortable, integrating spirituality in their work. They may fear that to attempt to do so would be unauthentic. It's for this reason, that we have created the face-spirit model and accompanying video. In this video, we will discuss how to integrate spirituality into counseling and we will show examples how the model can be used in working with clients. Now that we have discussed that why a spirituality in counseling, lets discuss some important terms. 

00:06:05
Religion and Spirituality 

00:06:05
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Religion and spirituality. 

00:06:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Well as therapist, it is important to understand that these words may have different connotations for different people. When we asked groups to identify the positive and the negative connotations of the term religion we often get the following responses. 

00:06:25
Positive Connotations with Religion Foundation Fellowship Tradition Unity Negative Connotations with Religion Judgmental Hypocrisy Sacrifice Sin & Damnation. 

00:06:25
R. CHARLES FAWCETT For positive we have, foundation, fellowship, tradition and unity. Negative associations are judgmental, hypocrisy, sacrifice, and sin and damnation. Individuals also see both positive and negative connotations associated with the term spirituality. Here are some of the typical responses on the positive side. 

00:06:50
Positive Connotations with Spirituality Self-awareness Holistic Open-minded Enlightenment Negative Connotations with Spirituality Lack of structure Isolation Egotistical "Dark side" potential 

00:06:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT We end up with self-awareness, holistic, Open-minded and enlightenment. On the negative side, we find such words as, lack of structure, isolation, egotistical and Dark side potential. 

00:07:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER It's interesting that there are both positive and negative connotations with both terms. 

00:07:20
Religion The practice of spirituality that involves traditions and beliefs, usually in a formal organization or setting Spirituality Personal beliefs or practices that people apply to make a connection with the infinite 

00:07:20
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Oh sure it is, perhaps a good working definition that we can use for religion might be the practice of spirituality that involves traditions and beliefs, usually in a formal organization or setting. And we can define spirituality as personal beliefs or practices that people apply to make a connection with the infinite. Our point here is that some clients will be more comfortable thinking in terms of spirituality while others will be more comfortable thinking and communicating in traditional religious terms. As therapist we need to be aware of this and accommodate our clients accordingly. We also want to emphasize that both spirituality and religion can be sources of comfort or incredible distress depending on the client situation. For example, one client's faith in religious community may contribute to her resilience while another's feelings of shame and sinfulness may add to his depression. Therefore it’s important for the therapist to be prepared for both possibilities. Professional should attempt to learn reasonable amount regarding the major religions. Although is beyond the scope of this video to discuss the beliefs and practices of all the worlds religions, today we are going to focus on integrating spirituality into counseling. Now that we discuss some important terms and why of integrating spirituality into counseling. Lets talk about the When? 

00:08:50
When? 

00:08:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Radha, as a life-span development scholar, are their times in people's lives when spirituality is more important or in the forefront? 

00:09:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Well, I'd hate to say that there is ever a time when spirituality is not important in someone's life. Of course, Fowler suggested that spirituality develops in stages as we go through life much as cognitive and moral development does. In his model, spiritual development is a normal part of the human experience. Although spirituality is always an essential aspect of our human potential, however, there are times when spirituality may become especially prominent in our awareness. Spiritual and religious issues often arise as individuals face major life transitions. These life changes fall into two categories; normative and non-normative. Normative changes are developmental transitions that arise as individuals move from one life stage to the next. 

00:09:55
Normative changes are developmental transitions that arise as individuals move from one life stage to the next. 

00:09:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Although normal and expected, these transitions often bring about a change in roles and sometimes require making adjustments. Such transitions may initially create a sense of disequilibrium and leave us feeling just a little out of balance. Such transitions, for example, becoming a caregiver for aging parents at midlife, something I have experienced. Are often accompanied by spiritual and existential concerns especially if the transition is difficult. This might be a goodtime to introduce two case studies that will refer to throughout the video. 

00:10:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT That's good idea. My clients Shawnell is a 35-year-old African-American woman, who is married and has two children. One of her presenting concerns is the stress she is experiencing caring for her elderly mother. It appears that Shawnell is going through one of those normative transitions right now. Shawnell, Why don't you tell me more about your mother. 

00:11:00
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Well, it seems as though I can never do anything right for her. I'd taken to all her doctors' appointments, I buy her groceries, I clean her house and she is still criticizes and it makes me feel like a failure. Sometimes I wonder why I was ever born. 

00:11:15
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmmm... It must be a very frustrating to do all that and then be so, so valued so little. 

00:11:20
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yeah it really bothers me. 

00:11:25
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmm... 

00:11:25
Non-normative changes are random life events that arise without warning. 

00:11:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER While normative changes are often very difficult at least they’re predictable. On the other hand, non-normative changes are random life events that arise without warning. These transitions which may be positive or negative cannot be prepared for an advance. An example of a negative non-normative transition might be a traumatic event such as debilitating accident that causes one to question his or her essential beliefs. On a more pleasant note however, a positive non-normative transition might still necessitate rearranging priorities. For example, winning the lottery or becoming famous. Something like this happened to my client Dale, who came to counseling after encountering a non-normative transition and most of us might envy. Dale is a 42-year-old gay man who spend with his life partner Steve for 15 years. Dale who had been employed as an accountant for 17 years, suddenly no longer needed to work after inheriting some very lucrative stocks from an elderly relative. In spite of their wealth, Dale's partner Steve decided to continue working as a successful CPA. Dale on the other hand chose to leave accounting because he'd never particularly enjoyed it. Here is a clip of Dale describing his situation and his presenting concern. 

00:13:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Dale now that we’ve gone over the limits of confidentiality and the other things that we had to talk about. What brings you to counseling? 

00:13:10
DALE Well, most recently I came into a lot of money from an inheritance from a family member and um, it’s sufficient enough that’s um, cause me to have the opportunity to quit the job I’m currently working with and to make bigger decisions um, for my life in terms of will I work? If I do work what will I be doing? Just a variety of things um, that I didn’t have to think about before, I’m beginning to think about now. What are my goals? What is my purpose and um, with this inheritance and these… these questions I’m getting these overwhelming sense of feeling empty of… of being unsure um, and unclear about my purpose. And um, so I’m feeling uncomfortable with that. 

00:13:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER It sounds very confusing. 

00:14:00
DALE Yes. Yes it is. 

00:14:00
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Well I won’t mind having that money part of the problem. 

00:14:05
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Dawn right. I don’t think I would either. But having to totally re-think one’s life set a new goals and manage it completely new set of choices and options would surely produce stress. Although I think that’s one kind of stress I could learn to manage. On a more serious note, non-normative transitions whether negative or positive are generally more stressful than normative changes. And they may result in a spiritual or existential crisis. At such times, individuals may be especially inclined to focus on spiritual, religious or existential issues in counseling in psychotherapy. Both Shawnell and Dale were considering the meaning of their lives as they moved into their new roles. They were questioning how to live honorably in the world and in relation to others. I realized however that some therapist may wonder how to recognize and broach such spiritual issues with their clients. So Charlie why don’t you talk about that? 

00:15:10
Recognizing and Broaching Spiritual Issues 

00:15:15
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Sure Radha. Spiritual issues can either be directly stated by the client or indirectly implied. In the following vineyard Shawnell directly states the spiritual concern related to her Christian beliefs. As you will see, she questions we were able to even work together. 

00:15:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Shawnell now that we’ve had a chance to talk about some of your concerns. Do you have any questions for me? 

00:15:40
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yes. Are you saved? Have you taken the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior? 

00:15:40
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmmm… you are a devote Christian and you’re worried about working with some body who is slightly different perspective? 

00:15:50
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD I’m worried about working with some one who doesn’t have strong Christian values? 

00:15:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmmm… they might steer you in the wrong direction. 

00:15:55
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yeah and may not understand my perspective. 

00:15:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT I see. Well, can I ask you a question? 

00:16:00
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Sure. 

00:16:00
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Now when you go to church, do all the members of your congregation agree on different bible passages or different church doctrine in the same way? 

00:16:10
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Well, no. We actually have some pretty heated debates on how to interpret different passages. 

00:16:15
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Sure. So, I’m wondering if may be we have just slightly different perspectives but as long as I’m sensitive and receptive to your points of view that if we could work together kind of in the same way as your church does um, you don’t think you could still benefit from that. 

00:16:30
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yeah, I think not that you put it like that… that would work. 

00:16:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Okay, well good. I look forward to working with you. 

00:16:35
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Okay. 

00:16:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER In Shawnell's case, the spiritual issues were very obvious and clearly needed to be addressed. However, some times there are more covert, indirect or… or hidden. 

00:16:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Do you mean like with Dale? 

00:16:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Exactly. As you saw in the previous vineyard, he talked about feeling empty. This was a clue that deeper spiritual or existential issues were present even though he didn’t state them. 

00:17:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Many therapist might wonder how to work with the client like Dale when the issues are not spiritual as I’m not directly stated. 

00:17:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Well, that’s tricky Charlie. This is one of the reasons that we created the face-spirit model and so your questions leads us into the most important part of the video the How section. 

00:17:30
How? 

00:17:30
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Before we talk about how to integrate spirituality and the counseling, may be you could discuss spiritual assessment. 

00:17:35
Spiritual Assessment 

00:17:40
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Sure Radha. An important component that should be included in the intake process is an assessment of the clients spiritual and religious history. This assessment should give the therapist information about the clients spiritual orientation and other pertinent facts or concerns that may be of focus of clinical attention. 

00:18:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER You mean like some one who was raised in a very strictly religious home and may be who no longer has the same believes but still suffers from guilt. 

00:18:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Exactly. One way to do this will be to add a question or a section on an intake form, would be important for the client to know that, none is an acceptable answer. Another useful tool is the genogram, to which a religious or spiritual component can be added. Or specifically religious and spiritual genograms can be created. Here is a view of such a genogram for Shawnell. Radha you didn’t use a genogram with Dale, did you? 

00:18:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER No Charlie. I didn’t. I didn’t use a genogram but I did include a question on the intake form that address spirituality. Um, and on that item on the form, Dale indicated that although he was raised catholic he no longer considered himself to be a member of that faith tradition. Instead he said that he practiced meditation, yoga and chanting which he’d learned from various Hindu, Buddhist and Sufi spiritual teachers. Speaking of assessment Charlie you have some formal spiritual assessment forms, don’t you? 

00:19:15
R. CHARLES FAWCETT I do. There are numerous forms available for taking spiritual assessments. The form that you see in your screen is an example of one created by us and there are directions at the end of the video, if you’d like a copy. 

00:19:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER I’m glad we assessed our two client’s spirituality because they were very different, weren’t they? 

00:19:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Oh they sure were. Shawnell is a Pentecostal and very involved in her church. 

00:19:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER And my client Dale described himself as a recovering catholic who never went to church anymore. Yet, he indicated that spirituality was very important to him, although religion was not. 

00:19:50
Working with Diverse Beliefs 

00:19:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Radha one question that beginning therapist often ask is how do I work with somebody who has a different religious background from myself or um, I know very little about the religion. 

00:20:10
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That’s a great question. And I would respond with the following advice. Don’t be afraid to ask about what you don’t know. In fact, adopting your stance of not knowing is often a highly productive means of discovering more about your clients spirituality. For example, you can ask clients to share their believes about the cause of their distress. As well as what they might consider to be the best means to alleviate it which may include spirituality. Doing this can help to reveal if clients associate their issues with spirituality. For example, a client might say this suffering is my karma for doing something wrong or God is punishing me for having impure thoughts and I need to repent. Like wise, some client may believe that certain spiritual interventions would be helpful in resolving their issues. Such as prayer or perhaps meditation. It can therefore be very beneficial to join forces collaboratively with clients in the selection of such interventions. For example, you might suggest home work assignments like keeping a prayer journal or attending a meditation group. These interventions would obviously be based on the clients own needs and desires rather than the spiritual inclinations of the therapist. In addition, therapist should create a collaborative alliances with pastoral counselors, religious studies experts and clergy persons from many spiritual traditions. Such person can act a subject matter experts and it can come in quite handy to call them when you have questions. In some cases, the client may even appreciate having these individuals participate in his or her counseling sessions. 

00:22:05
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Probably there is a lot to learn and we need to be open. 

00:22:05
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Yes, we do. Its critical that we maintain an attitude of openness and avoid imposing your own personal values in counseling. Some times this can inadvertently occur as a result of our lack of familiarity with the believes and practices of other religions and cultures. So it’s very important to learn about their customs and expressions of spirituality. For example, the clinician should take into consideration whether the client is from a culture that’s individualistic as in our western culture or collectivist in their thinking, as this is generally true of traditional eastern cultures. This differentiation can help the therapist tailor his or her approach to the world view of the client. Also, one should consider the types of spiritual believes and practices valued in the clients religion. Examples might include culture specific attitudes regarding elders or parents. The importance of spiritual disciplines such as meditation, fasting or prayer or notions such as karma, scriptural inerrancy or being filled with the holy spirit. 

00:23:20
R. CHARLES FAWCETT I encourage mental health and human services professionals to periodically conduct a self inventory of their own world view in spiritual believes and to strive to become aware of their own biases. A good way to do this is engage in inter-religious dialogue or research. Of course these activities should be considered an ongoing process and to be continued throughout one’s professional life. 

00:23:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Charlie you recently mentioned to me something that happened in one of your sessions with Shawnell. 

00:23:45
R. CHARLES FAWCETT That’s right. She was describing to me an event that occurred with her last weekend at church. Shawnell what was that you wanted to tell me about um, this weekend? 

00:23:55
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Oh it was incredible. The holy spirit fell on me and before I knew what it hit me, I was on the floor on my back for 20 minutes. I was so blessed to be in the presence of the Lord. 

00:24:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Wow sounds like quite an experience. 

00:24:10
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Oh it was awesome. 

00:24:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Indeed. Fortunately I knew Shawnell was Pentecostal. A belief system that consider such experiences to be sacred and transcendent, otherwise, I might have feared psychopathology or assume she had a physical condition requiring treatment. 

00:24:30
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That’s right. We could see from your example why its important to understand our clients belief systems. I too had some thing come up in a session with Dale that might have been misunderstood. He described to me an out of body experience that he had one night which was quite important to him. Dale you mentioned some thing that happened last night. 

00:24:50
DALE Yeah it was a fairly unusual for me. It has never… never happened before. Um, I’m going to call it an out of body experience and that um, we were sleeping and I raised up out of the bed and was able to look down on Steve and I and we were arm in arm and it was just a really calm image as they came into mind. And what's interesting is the contrast with um, this man of stress that I’m going through in this decision process that I’m having to go to… to decide um and I realize looking at this image of Steve and I, that as long as we are together arm in arm I got this overwhelming sense of confidence. The serene feeling of confidence that together we are going to be able to get through this. 

00:25:35
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Sounds like that was really significant for you and very comforting. 

00:25:40
DALE Yeah. It was a very… very powerful for me. 

00:25:45
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Wow. Many people might have considered Dale’s experience is highly unusual or dismissed it as a dream. 

00:25:50
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Yes. That’s right. I too might not have taken his experience seriously or perhaps even worried about Dale’s mental health. However, my graduate studies in eastern religions allowed me to understand that such experiences are not uncommon. Although they can seem extraordinary to westerners such occurrences are often taken as a matter of course in Hinduism and Buddhism. Their phenomena such as astral projection or some times byproducts of spiritual practice. These examples illustrate the need to have appropriate knowledge and attitudes when working with the plethora of belief systems and spiritual experiences that exist. 

00:26:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT That’s right Radha. There are many spiritual paths and much to learn. I think this would be a good time to introduce our specific strategies and interventions for integrating spirituality into counseling, the face-spirit model. 

00:26:50
FACE-SPIRIT Model 

00:26:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT We developed the face-spirit model to show how spirituality could be integrated into secular counseling. Tying into the work of torn and others we have suggested that integration could occur either implicitly or explicitly. We developed a model to give mental health professionals a practical guide regarding how both might be done. In designing the model, we hope to show how spirituality could be welcomed into rather than excluded from the counseling process. The face-spirit model is an acronym for the implicit and the explicit interventions we will discuss. As you can see from the graphic of the model, the acronym face is on the inside of the circle because this is the inner work that is done with oneself. And the outer portion of the model spells spirit because these interventions that are performed with the client. 

00:27:45
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Beginning on the inside FACE is an acronym for the implicit strategies that involve only the therapist. They may be practiced at the therapist discussion, perhaps before the client arrives. Face stands for the inner work that we do within ourselves that promotes harmony and balance. The face strategies help us to transcend our separateness and to realize the interdependent nature of reality. Another way of thinking a face beyond the acronym for which it stands is the notion of alterity or otherness. Its believed by many that we find God in the face of another person. That when we have a moment of truly authentic connection what Buber called an ‘I thou relationship’. We experience a taste of divine love. It’s that… it’s in that instant in which we truly honor the humanity of the other person and break away from the smallness, the very separateness. Involves the change of perspective of what I like to call, the little me to the big we. When I speak of this vantage point I’m reminded of a very beautiful greeting in Hinduism. In which one person says to another, Namaste which means the divine in me greets the divine in you. The implicit strategies of face which are done within the therapist himself or herself are designed to bring about this sense of profound connection that allows genuine helping to occur. 

00:29:40
R. CHARLES FAWCETT And spirit is an acronym for the explicit strategies which involve addressing spiritual issues directly with the client. The spirit strategies entail the therapist and client together honoring the role of the spirituality plays in the client’s life. As you can see, the spirit strategies comprise the entire outer circle of the model which is intentional because we believe strongly that the are of marginalizing spirituality has passed. It’s time for spirituality to claim its rightful place in counseling and therapy. We will discuss the spirit part of the model in more detail later in the video but for now, lets emphasize that together the implicit and the explicit parts of the model combined to read face-spirit and we think that’s a good model for mental health. Now, lets move on to the model itself. I’ll begin by discussing the first implicit integration strategy. 

00:30:35
FACE Implicit Integration Strategies Focusing on the Present 

00:30:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT The F in FACE stands for Focusing on the Present. Our minds have a tendency to want to focus on the past often with regret or focus on the future with either fear or eager anticipation. In either case, we are not in the present moment. Most religions include practices that help us bring the mind to a still point in which such anxieties are forgotten. So that we may focus on higher concerns. From the therapist stand point, the present is the only place where we can truly be with our clients or patients. I have found one of the quickest and easiest ways to focus in the present is to become aware of the world immediately around me. I simply sit back in my chair, close my eyes, I feel the arms of the chair supporting my arms and my hands. I know there is the back of the chair supporting me. The way the chair feels under my tarsal and the way my feet fell against the floor. Next I focus on my breathing. I observe the air passing in and out of my lungs through my nose or mouth. I notice that neither tactile sensations in my body. I may do this for either a few second or some times for several minutes. As a result, I found my awareness becomes focused in the present and I engage the client and attend to him or her with high insensitivity. 

00:32:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That practice sounds very similar to Buddhist vipassana and Zen meditation practices in which one just observes thoughts and sensations without clinging to any of them. 

00:32:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, I like to do this before I meet with the client. Just ensure that I’m in the right state of mind. 

00:32:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That’s so important. Although Charlie demonstrated one method of focusing on the present, there are many ways that you can do this. So use what ever works for you. Charlie why don’t you now tell us about the A in FACE? 

00:32:30
Asking for Guidance 

00:32:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT The A in FACE stands for Asking for Guidance. Of course, this practice will vary from person to person depending on his or her beliefs, if any regarding God or higher power. I tend to ask for guides using affirmations as you will see from the next vineyard(ph) Father, Mother God. I know the divine intelligence of the universe is in this room. I know it is every where and in every thing. It is in this furniture, its in my very own body. I know that I’m one with that intelligence and it is one with me. I know that it guides me as I work with Shawnell in a few moments. I know that I will have divine insight into her situation. I will able to conceptualize her case and I will have wisdom in her treatment planning. I’m thankful for this guidance and this wisdom that will be directing me and I release these words to the universe of Lord knowing that its so and so it is. 

00:33:45
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Charlie I notice that you stated that more as an affirmation. But I imagine some therapist might feel more comfortable reciting the more traditional prayer or may be one from the prayer book or reading a passage from some sacred text. These would be methods of asking for guidance too wouldn’t they? 

00:34:05
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Yes. There are many ways to ask for guidance. 

00:34:05
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER So its up to each of us to… to connect to the source in our own way. 

00:34:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Yes exactly. 

00:34:15
Cultivation of Compassion 

00:34:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER After asking for guidance, the next part of our model is the C in FACE which stands for Cultivation of compassion. I sometimes think that this C is at the very core of counseling because compassion allows us to develop unconditional positive regard for our clients and ourselves. It puts the heart in what we do. I considered compassion to be much like the concept of love or charity in Christianity which is said to be the greatest of all spiritual gifts. Compassion is also much like the concept of metta or loving kindness in Buddhism. In fact, I like to cultivate compassion in myself before seeing clients by doing a short visualization called the practice of loving kindness which came from the Buddhist tradition. Cornfield and others suggested that this practice should begin by first extending loving kindness to yourself because without being appease with yourself its probably impossible to help anyone else. You visualize yourself first as being a beloved child and being well happy and peaceful. Next you visualize someone in your life who is truly cared for you. Some one that you respect and who has given you a lot of love and support. It should be someone toward whom you can easily extend love and thoughts and compassion. You extend love and kindness to that person. Then you extend love and kindness outward to other such as friends acquaintances and to your client. If you wish, you may extend it out even further to people every where and to all living beings. You can eventually even extend compassion to your enemies and to the most difficult people you know and we’d probably all know a few of those. The key to the practice however, is it you really feel the compassion rather than just saying the words. Here is a clip of me doing a very abbreviated exercise to cultivate compassion before Dale arrives. This might begin after I’d already gotten myself relaxed by focusing on the present and asking for guidance or I might just do this practice alone and with all of these strategies please feel free to pick and choose and do what feels right to you at the moment. I would begin the practice of love and kindness with myself and then expand it out to others. May I be well happy and peaceful. May I also have patience, courage and wisdom. May my family be well, happy and peaceful. May they also have patience, courage and wisdom. May Dale be well, happy and peaceful. May he also have patience, courage and wisdom. May all beings be well, happy and peaceful. May they also have patience, courage and wisdom. 

00:37:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Radha I noticed the extent of love and kindness to your family. Could it have been to anyone? 

00:38:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Possibly. It best to think of some one living who won’t arouse any conflicting emotions in you. Of course your mind have become less than calm but other than that its totally up to you. 

00:38:15
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Good. Then this must have really helped you to get ready for Dale. 

00:38:20
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Yes it did. And I tried to maintain that sense of peace and equanimity through out the session because it really helps me to listen and have empathy. That brings us to the last implicit component of the model. That’s the E in FACE which stands for Existential Empathy. 

00:38:40
Existential Empathy 

00:38:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Existential empathy consist of listening for the spiritual earning of the client. The deeper longing behind the words, the logos or meaning that the client is striving to find in his or her life. Frankl coined the term logotherapy to describe how he worked with his clients to achieve greater meaning. And, when I speak of existential empathy, I think of that as being very similar. Existential empathy involves more than simply hearing the ordinary details that are conveyed through the client stories. It, instead, it allows us to attend to the clients engagement with the larger issues that are inhere in existence itself. Perhaps, it would be easier to illustrate this by showing you a clip of a session with Dale. So, Dale you were talking about all the changes you’ve been through since you inherited all this money. I wonder if you could tell me more about that. 

00:39:40
DALE Yeah, it’s… it’s… it’s actually, what was that, complicated ah… And with this inheritance it’s giving me the opportunity not to… to work where I’m currently working, and actually, the decision is not even to work at all. Um… Steve is talking to me about going back to school, but I never was sure. If I wanna go back to school, what would I go back to school for. You know and so, the process I’m going through is if I do you know what will it be, will let you something that really matters and… and do I really know what… what… you know what I can do that really matters. So, it’s a real… it’s… it’s a struggle. Um… I’m going to find something that I enjoy doing um… and um… that’s not pointless, that’s something that’s you know that has some value and that’s not pointless. 

00:40:25
As I listen do Dale, I realized that his real issue might involve the need to feel that he is making a contribution that he has something a value to give to his relationships and to the world. Dale’s longing to do something that matters and his own questioning of who he really is will guide my response. 

00:40:50
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Dale, it sounds like you're feeling very uncertain of what you should do with your life now and… and how your situation fits into the divine plan. 

00:41:05
DALE Well yeah, I mean I’m certain and also this is overwhelming sense of guilt for me is you know why me, why did I inherit this money and the power of that guilt is you know, now what? 

00:41:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER And you wanna make sense out of it all, it seems like that you want to find some purpose of some way that you can contribute to the world. 

00:41:30
DALE Yeah purpose and… and you know… and it is making something doing something with a lot of meaning, not like just working in 95 or something with a lot more meaning, it doesn’t may be necessarily relate to material thing; something good for the world is… is what I’m looking for. 

00:41:45
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER You wanna get back something. 

00:41:45
DALE That’s its exactly. 

00:41:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Existential empathy really seem to help you go with the heart of Dale’s issue. 

00:41:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Yes, it did, but there are times when we may wish to not only use implicit strategies, but also explicit ones. This brings us to the end of our discussion of implicit strategies and the beginning of our discussion of explicit strategies or the spirit part of the model. 

00:42:15
SPIRIT Explicit Integration Strategies 

00:42:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER In our presentation of the spirit part of our model, we’ll show you how to use explicit strategies to integrate spirituality directly into you work with clients. But before we began our discussion of spirit interventions there are several critically important caveat that must be addressed. 

00:42:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Good point, Radha. These interventions should never be pushed on clients. To attempt to do so, it would be to meet the of the clinician, rather than the client. Explicit strategies should only be used, if the client ask for them, or if you know they are appropriate. Even if you feel it’s certain at these interventions would be acceptable to the client, ask the client’s permission before attempting to use them. 

00:43:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER With that said, let’s move on to the first explicit strategy, the S in spirit. The S in spirit refers to Similes and Metaphors, which can be used to help client work through issues that are troubling them. 

00:43:15
Similes and Metaphors 

00:43:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Similes and Metaphors compared too seemingly dissimilar objects such as my heart is like the ocean or I’m a rock. Similes and Metaphors can be used to convey feeling and work through issues and are often very useful in problem solving. Gladding talked a lot about Similes and Metaphors and said that they work because they help us see our lives in new ways by making the strange familiar and the familiar strange. Using Similes and Metaphors can help to increase feelings of competence and connectedness and we believe they can also help us get in touch with ultimate concerns. Therefore, we’ve included them as the S in spirit. Perhaps, it would be helpful to illustrate the strategy by showing how I Simile and Metaphor with Dale. I had mentioned to Dale in the previous session that I wondered about the role that spirituality played in his life. As mentioned before I knew that Dale didn’t belong to any particular religious group, but that he considered himself to be on a spiritual path. To make it easier to address the topic of spirituality. I asked Dale, if he would be willing to do a homework assignment for me. The task was to find something that could serve as a simile or a metaphor for his own spiritual journey or in the role that spirit or a higher power played in his life. Dale asked if it could be anything even a close finch(ph). And I assured him that it could be anything that accurately symbolize spirituality to him. In the next video clip, you’ll see what happened. Hi Dale, how are you today? 

00:45:05
DALE God, I’m doing great and look I’ve done my homework. 

00:45:10
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Great. Where did you bring? 

00:45:10
DALE Well, I brought in lilac bush and… and in… and in… in many ways, it represents for me spirituality and that it is beautiful and… and delicate and in another ways, it can be easily stamped on and crushed. 

00:45:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER So, it sounds like spirituality is really important in your life because it brings your life beauty, but it’s also very tenuous and delicate. 

00:45:40
DALE Well, much so. I… you know, I think that I’ve been sort of mystical in most of my life. Even, I can remember as a kid um… and telling my mother about how if I look up into the stars long enough that I could actually sort of travel to the stars. And… and her reaction was… was very much negative. She told me that if I continue talking that way, it worried her to the point that she would take me to a psychiatrist. And… and from that moment on, it sort of, maybe feel like you know it was bad, and so I put it away, I shut it off. 

00:46:10
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER So, your mother stomped on your flower. 

00:46:15
DALE Yeah, yes, she did. And… and um… you know it’s… it… it cause me to think how important um… um… the mystical side, the spiritual side is of me and um… it’s been you know been a struggle and it’s been a struggle to find a place for. 

00:46:35
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER And so, it sounds like that’s a very important part of your life, but you feel that you need to protect it because it is so delicate. 

00:46:40
DALE If I can find a way, I think what would be great for me is to figure out a way to build a wall or a motor or something around it to… to protect it. 

00:46:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER I wonder how that relates to your relationship with other people, particularly I’m thinking about Steve. 

00:47:05
DALE Well, it’s interesting you say that. I sense that I do that. I do that with Steve and I do that with others. Um… I keep them out, they… they come and just a slight, but that I can recall this with Steve, but… but then there’s a point that I completely shut them down. So I… I like the image as to figure a way to… to… to leap over that. 

00:47:20
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER So, it sounds like, maybe you need a bridge and a gate to go along with your moat in your wall, so that the people that you really trust could come in and water it the precious flower. But only the one she trust. 

00:47:40
DALE That would be wonderful. That would be wonderful, I… I can just see that image, it will be a great image. 

00:47:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Radha, it sounds like the flower similarly in such were very effective with working with Dale. But what if he had forgotten to bring in an object. 

00:47:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Oh, Charlie, that wouldn’t have been a problem. You can simply use words to express similes and metaphors. They can also work quite well as long as the client can think abstractly. I found however, they’re having actual tangible objects that clients can touch and sometimes, makes it easier to approach the subject of spirituality. I would like to keep a simile box in my office and inside it I have small items like a sun, and a moon, shells, feathers, stones, silk flowers, animals, hearts and other things that could be used a similes. I’ll then ask clients to pick one of the items from the simile box and consider questions such as how might this object be a simile or metaphor for your own spiritual development?. Or, how might it represent the function that spirituality serves in your life or what place would you like it to have in the future like one client picked a little stone and said well, this is how spirituality is in my life now, but in the future, I would like it to be bolder. Another way you might use simile would be to ask clients if they can think of any character or situation in a holy book such as the bible or Quran that could serve as a simile or metaphor for things happening in their own lives. 

00:49:25
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Do you mean like David slaying Goliath? 

00:49:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Exactly. Sometimes, similes can be used to help clients reframe the way they think about what they are experiencing in order to gain strength or feel empowered. You can then go along with the simile they mentioned and ask how might that character deal with your problem or what would Jesus do in that situation, or what would the Brutus say about that depending, of course on the client spiritual tradition. 

00:49:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, that certainly could be beneficial. Now, let’s move on to the P part of the spirit and talk about that. The P in the spirit model stands for Prayer. As we mentioned earlier, it’s critical to follow the client’s lead regarding this issue. I never ask the client to pray during the session, unless I’m certain of several things. For example, I want to make sure the client has strong spiritual or religious believes that he or she currently practice those believes in his or her life and is open about discussing his or her spirituality. Once I know these things, then and only then, do I ask permission to [00:50:35integrate prayer into therapy. It’s so important to respect that only the client spirituality that his or her desire or willingness to integrate into counseling. I’m gonna suggest three functions that prayer considered in a therapeutic context. These are, one, for explicit guidance with the session, which is usually done at the beginning with the client. Two, for specific and direct outcomes for client issues. This can occur anytime during the session, but will occur most often at the end, once goals or outcomes have been determined. And three, as homework for the client, this is a way for therapist who don’t have strong spiritual believes for themselves who nevertheless support and encourage their client’s spirituality. 

00:51:20
Functions of Prayer within a Therapeutic Context: 1. Explicit guidance during session 2. Request for specific and direct outcomes 3. Homework to address issues and concerns 

00:51:20
R. CHARLES FAWCETT As you will see in the following winceyette I’ll ask Shawnell if she wants to pray for guidance during or the beginning of our session. Although, I wouldn’t consider myself a born again Christian. I do believe in the power of prayer, and I’ve even seen how effective that was in the research. What would you think about you and I praying together during this session? 

00:51:40
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD That would be okay. 

00:51:40
R. CHARLES FAWCETT What would you think about us praying maybe even right now, before we get started in this session just asking for god’s guidance. 

00:51:45
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Sure. 

00:51:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Okay well, would you like to do it or should I do it? 

00:51:50
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD You go ahead. I’ll do it next time. 

00:51:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Okay. Dear god, we know that your presence is here with us, in this room. We know that it is with us wherever we go. We know that you care so much about us that you know of every hair on Shawnell’s and my head that is lost. And we are asking for your divine wisdom and guidance to lead us together today in this session. Because we know how deeply you care about every concern and issue that Shawnell has. We are thankful for this wisdom and guidance that leads us and for the blessings that you bestow upon us. Amen. 

00:52:30
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD In Jesus name, amen. Thank you. 

00:52:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT You're welcome. 

00:52:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Charlie what has been your experience in asking clients to pray with you? 

00:52:45
R. CHARLES FAWCETT As you know Radha, I only ask certain clients. But I’m always amazed by how much they appreciate it. It really seems to build an alliance between the client and myself. It tells them how much I respect and appreciate such an important part of their life. 

00:53:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Great. Now, why didn’t you tell us about the I part of the model. 

00:53:05
R. CHARLES FAWCETT The first I in the spirit model stands for interpretation of sacred texts. 

00:53:10
Interpretation of Sacred Texts. 

00:53:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT This technique is useful for clarifying client’s believes, revealing logical or (inaudible ) incongruencies and inaccuracies, and helping clients to use their own wisdom traditions, the self problems in their lives. 

00:53:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER But Charlie that might seem intimidating to some. What about therapist who aren’t theologians or scholars of the Bible or Quran? How do they do this? 

00:53:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT That’s a good point Radha. You don’t have to be scholar, but some familiarity with the clients wisdom tradition is not only helpful, but reasonable expectation if the therapist is to practice ethically. As we mentioned earlier, it is wise to have relationship with pastoral counselor or receptive clergy person to whom one can turn for insight and input. And, of course, now there is an abundance of literature available. Counselors, social workers, psychologist must have sensitivity and humility and be aware of when they need to collaborate. However, while working with their own comfort zones, we can still ask questions and observe possible conceptual and consistencies on the client’s part. That might help address the issues that are contributing to the client’s emotional distress. We have to remember that debating client’s believes is never helpful. However, we can help them critique and clarify certain aspects of their beliefs. By appealing to a broader, and perhaps better new ways to understanding of their scriptural basis of their beliefs, clients can sometimes gain better understanding. This has the potential to be very liberating. As the following video(ph) indicates it would be very difficult to help this client without referring to the sacred texts. So Shawnell, what is it that you like to talk about today? 

00:54:55
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Well, not only do I have to deal with my mother, but I’m confused and frustrated about my husband and my marriage. 

00:55:05
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Umm… You're feeling conflicted about it. 

00:55:10
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yeah, my husband, he is a kind man and he treats me fair, but lately, I’ve been having thoughts of divorce and we’re both very religious and we did make vows till death do us part. 

00:55:20
R. CHARLES FAWCETT So, you feel guilty about or even thinking about that, it sounds like. 

00:55:25
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yeah. 

00:55:30
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmm… What… what seems to be the… the major issue? 

00:55:30
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Well, I hasn’t had a job in a while he hasn’t worked in a while, he hasn’t worked in a few years about eight or nine of them. 

00:55:40
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Umm… And you must be extremely frustrated. 

00:55:45
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Actually, I’m at his heck about it. 

00:55:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Yeah, I can… I can imagine. Um… So certainly you’ve talked about this what… what comes up from that? 

00:55:55
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD His response is the make shall here at the earth and, he is right you know it is in the Bible. 

00:56:05
Next Session 

00:56:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Shawnell, I’d like to revisit our conversation we had last week about neatness. I believe what you had mentioned was from the Sermon on the Mount. Matthew 5:5 "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." 

00:56:25
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Umm… Yeah, that sounds right. 

00:56:25
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Okay. What is the word meek mean to you? 

00:56:30
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Umm… I don’t know. Passive, quite, and easy going. My husband is really easy going. 

00:56:40
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmm…Hmm… Why we have a chance to do some research, since the last time we met, and do you know who the Bible considers to be the meekest person? 

00:56:50
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD No. Who? 

00:56:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Well, according to numbers 12:3, it is Mosses. This way a guy who stood up to the Pharaoh, lead the nation of Israel for 40 years and was very much of a take-charge kind of person. It’s bit surprising, isn’t it? 

00:57:05
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yes. 

00:57:05
R. CHARLES FAWCETT According to William Barclay’s commentary, biblical meekness means a take-charge kind of attribute that’s something that you normally associate with being this, but something that Mosses, in fact had. An example that they gave us in proverb 16:32 “He that rules the spirit is better than he who takes the city.” 

00:57:30
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD And if that’s what meek means, I wish my husband was meeker. 

00:57:35
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Well Charlie, it looks like Shawnell’s husband might have been interpreting meekness and obedience differently than the Bible globally defines these terms. 

00:57:45
R. CHARLES FAWCETT That’s right, Radha. It is not uncommon for one spouse to twist a meaning in a sacred text for his or her benefit. With a little persistence, this can often be clarified. 

00:57:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER But Charlie unless you're are a biblical scholar that must take a tremendous amount of time and research. 

00:58:05
R. CHARLES FAWCETT And of course, I’m not a biblical scholar. However, it’s amazing what a Google search can do nowadays. Alternatively, calling an expert or a clergy person could produce quick and helpful information. And if you don’t have time for either of those, assign the research to the client as bibliotherapy homework that’s what I often do and why don’t you tell us about the R in the spirit model, Radha. 

00:58:30
Rituals 

00:58:30
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Sure Charlie, I would be glad to. Rituals are incorporated in most religious traditions, and rituals can also be used in counseling and therapy. So what are rituals? Rituals are symbolic rites that help individuals relate, hea and change. And they can serve three major purposes, celebration, liberation and transformation. 

00:58:55
Types of Rituals Celebration Liberation Transformation 

00:58:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Celebration rituals honor what has been achieved, express love and caring, affirm relationships and create a heightened sense of community. Celebration rituals occur frequently and most of us would probably experience many celebration rituals in our daily lives. Typical examples of celebration rituals might include a party to honor an achievement such as a promotion or being a… being given a chip in AA for staying sober. On the other hand, liberation rituals promote catharsis and provide freedom from painful memories. An example of a liberation ritual might be to write down a persistent negative thought, and then burn the paper that it’s written on. Finally, transformation rituals signify endings and beginnings and mark entry into new developmental phases. They allow closer to occur and promote anticipation of what’s to come. 

01:00:05
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Radha you used a ritual with Dale. Why don’t you go ahead and share that with us? 

01:00:05
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Yes, I would be glad to. I did help Dale develop a ritual. As you know, now that he had had… had inherited such grade well. Dale was really struggling to make sense out of his life. Since, he no longer had to work to bring in money, Dale was uncertain of what he had offer to the world. As you saw in the previous clip, Dale considered himself to be a spiritual person at heart and also to be very sensitive in caring. Therefore, Dale thought it might be a good idea to go back to graduate school and study social work and in that way he could help others and give back something to society. Through service to others, Dale hope to get in touch with his own higher nature and maybe, even feel less guilty about being so privileged. Although, Dale had reached a tentative carrier decision and he has still felt somewhat insecure about moving from his former field of accounting to a profession that was really quite different. Although Dale had never felt totally congruent as an accountant, he still thought of himself as one. For that reason, I believed it might be beneficial to help Dale design a transformation ritual to redefine himself. Through the ritual, he might craft a new identity and move more freely into this new phase of his life. The next clip will show us discussing the ritual. Dale as I’ve listened to your concerns about moving into a new feel. It occurred to me that it might be helpful to you to design a ritual that would help you move into this new phase of your life. 

01:01:55
DALE Well, when you say ritual, do you mean like a retirement party or like something that I had when I left my last job? 

01:02:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER A retirement party is a great example of a celebration ritual, but what I’m thinking about is actually more of a transformation ritual and in a transformation ritual, you really do something that will help you get closer on your own way of life, and then enter you’re your new one. In other words, it’ll represent the new year. 

01:02:25
DALE That’s pretty interesting and is there way that I could bring Steve into that? I mean we talked about just either day about the flower and how I create a moat around the flower that… and then many ways do that to people, especially with Steve. Um… Is there just like an incorporate him in the ritual? 

01:02:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Absolutely. You definitely can involve Steve. In fact, you can involve as people as you want or you could do it totally alone that’s really up to you. 

01:02:50
DALE Well that’s great and tell me, can you tell how to… how do you do a ritual? What’s… what’s involved? 

01:02:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER What you would do is to plan something that would be personally meaningful and, you can usually do things like incorporate places that are special to you or food or music, pictures, anything that really say something to you. But the real important thing in rituals is that you do some symbolic action that will really represent your moving into to this new phase of your life. 

01:03:30
DALE God, that sounds so exciting. I’m actually ready to go. 

01:03:35
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Great. Well, I’ll be really excited about hearing how it turns out for you and what you planned to do? 

01:03:40
DALE It’s great. 

01:03:40
Next Session 

01:03:45
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Hi, Dale? How are you today? 

01:03:50
DALE Doing great. 

01:03:50
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER You look really exuberant. 

01:03:50
DALE Well I am, I mean we’ve… we’ve got the ritual of all rituals planned. I’m… I’m really excited about it. 

01:03:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Oh, could you tell me more? 

01:04:00
DALE Yeah… we’re gonna to do… there is a lot of significance to the first place where Steve and I met. So we’re gonna go back to that place it’s where I had um… my first real job and certainly where I met Steve for the first time. And there is some really significance attached to this. It’s not the most exciting place to some, but for me there’s… there is some very important aspects of that location. Um… it’s an office park and in the office park there is this wonderful fountain right in the front. I just… you just... I just can always remember that fountain. And when I go there, um… sort of there is a starting point um… we still have some friends that live in the area. So we’re gonna invite the friends from… from back then that are still in the area, so have them involve as well. And um… it’s gonna be sort of a picnic. We’re gonna have one of my favorite restaurants both of ours favorite restaurants from… only lived in the area um… cater, a picnic for everybody. And so we’re gonna have some… some special food. And along with the food I’m gonna do this um… centerpiece is gonna be this slideshow. And it’s gonna to be on my laptop. I got a fairly large screen on my laptop. And it will show the old me and new me sort of a transformation. It will show pictures of me in my old job. It will show activities that I used to do um… it’ll have pictures. You know some old interesting pictures of me and what was I… I was involved with back then. And then it’ll have pictures of me today, pictures today of me volunteering, pictures of the different things and… things I’m doing today and sort of show that transformation from the old Dale to the new Dale. Umm… I’m also gonna do something special for everybody attending. I’m gonna create a special gift that I’m gonna hand make for everybody that’s attending, sort of as a special gift from me to commemorate the special occasion that they’ve joined me in. And then finally I’m gonna do something that um… is probably outrageous for me. It’s… it’s… it’s just gonna reflect my risk-taking. There is this pond that I told you about. It’s really beautiful. It’s sort of a pond and there is this wonderful fountain in the middle of it. And just that image has… has always been on my mind. And you know I… I was always tempted to jump in the… the fountain and I never did. But I’m gonna do it this time. I’m gonna surprise everybody. It’s gonna reflect sort of the new me and sort of the risk taking that’s in me. And so sort of at the end of this… this ritual, I’m gonna jump in the pond and my expectation is that mostly everybody will join me and it will be this kind of wonderful sort of combined new all of us. So I’m … I’m really looking forward to it. 

01:06:30
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER It sounds like you have really planned a meaningful ritual. I really look forward to hearing how it goes. 

01:06:35
DALE Yeah, I am really looking forward to this. This is gonna be pretty exciting. 

01:06:40
R. CHARLES FAWCETT So how did it go with Dale? 

01:06:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER The ritual went extremely well. Steve and his friends were very supportive and doing the ritual really helped Dale to feel more solid in his newly chosen path. Ironically, many of his friends told Dale that they’ve never really thought his heart was in accounting, even though he was good at it. And they were surprised he had made the change years ago. I think this enabled Dale to feel even more confident that he was on the right track because it can sometimes be difficult to make spiritual progress and isolation from others, I also suggested today… try to seek out a spiritual teacher or find some kindred spirits with whom he could practice meditation and yoga. He actually knew of the spiritual community where he felt very much at home and decided to start participating in their activities. 

01:07:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT So was that the end of your work with Dale? 

01:07:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER No, actually we had one more session after that and it was quite interesting. I used imagery with Dale in the last session and that’s the second eye in the spirit part of their model. Imagery has been used extensively in the wisdom traditions. In Catholicism Saint Ignatius prescribed practices using the visual imagination. Tantric Buddhism relies heavily on visualization practices and Eastern Orthodox, it has a rich history of using icons as aids to spiritual development. Imagery can also be quite effective in helping clients achieve spiritual insight and counseling and therapy. There are various ways to incorporate spiritual imagery in your practice. One way is to invite clients to close their eyes, take several deep breaths, relax and imagine that they're in a very peaceful place. If you know the client well, you can tailor your description of the place to somewhere that you know he or she would feel comfortable. Or you can just leave it open-ended You can then have the client visualize a very spiritual figure who approaches and has a special message or gift to convey to the person. 

01:09:00
R. CHARLES FAWCETT So would the spiritual figure be something like an angel? 

01:09:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER It could be. It might also be a person, a profit, or even the sacred animal. It could be any type of messenger that comes to the client. Would you like to see how imagery worked with Dale? 

01:09:15
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Absolutely. 

01:09:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Okay. Here is a clip that occurred in our last session. Dale had begun taking social work classes and was really enjoying them. And he was also receiving positive feedback on his skills. Almost all of his classmates were women however. And he was experiencing some self-doubt about going into what appeared to him to be a primarily female professor. Although Dale was gay, he took pride in not being feminine and going into a profession dominated by women seem somehow to threaten his masculinity. Although he was still committed to becoming a social worker, he wanted some reassurance that he wasn’t making a mistake. So Dale, you’ve started your social work program. How is that going? 

01:10:10
DALE Well it’s going very well. But at the same time, I’m still not sure. I… I am uncertain is this the right thing to do and you know I… I’m actually really looking for somebody to tell me what to do and I love for you to tell me what to do, but I’m sure you’re not gonna do that. 

01:10:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That’s right. As you know, that’s not my role to tell you what to do, but maybe you could find some answers by going within. Would you like to try some imagery? 

01:10:35
DALE I’m certainly willing to give it a try. 

01:10:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Okay. What I’d like to invite you to do is get very comfortable in you chair. And if you like, you may close your eyes and take a several deep breaths and with each breath in, just try to breath in, deep relaxation. And with each breath out that all the stress flow out of you. So just breathe in relaxation and breathe out stress. 

01:11:25
[sil.] 

01:11:30
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER And now I invite you to visualize yourself being in a very deep green forest, it’s very quiet and peaceful and you feel totally release, you smell the rich dark aroma of the earth, you hear the birds chirping above you, singing their happy songs. You feel the coolness of a breeze caressing your skin, and you delight in the colors that surround you, the bright blues of the wild flowers and the green of the leaves and the sparking water that’s flowing in a little brook that goes along the rocks through the woods. And as you sit there close to the water and feel a soft breeze caressing your skin. In the distance you hear a gentle wresting and you see a figure that’s luminous and full of love. This figure has a gift that’s especially for you and if you like you can invite the figure to come closer and give you that gift. The gift is yours to accept if you choose and you may do anything with the gift that you wish. If you do decide to accept the gift, it will be yours to keep, you may use it anyway you want and you may accepted it so completely that it will become a part of you. 

01:14:05
[sil.] 

01:14:10
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER And ask you say goodbye to this figure, you’ll feel a heart full of gratitude, you’ll be totally… totally at peace and very-very comfortable. And when you’re ready, you may open your eyes and return to this room. 

01:14:45
[sil.] 

01:14:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Dale I notice you’re smiling. 

01:15:00
DALE That’s amazing. I just… had this wonderful image of my grandfather who passed away several years ago and we were very-very close. And I have this image of him giving me this book and in the book was this picture ah… and the image was this very violent, rough sea with the small boat and somebody on the boat. And it was you know fairly rough scene and um… in the sky you could see these clouds, powerful clouds. Amongst the clouds I can see this um… these hands… his… his arms are reaching out and… and… and you know very strong and they’re… they’re in the image. Um… almost like blessing the individual on the boat and giving the person on the boat directions sort of you know pointing to the way home. And what’s interesting is that I’m seeing that I’m the person in the boat. And um… and I’m feeling protected if I’m willing to look up and see these arms this… this… this spiritual um… strength is if I’m willing to look up and see it that I have um… that I have direction that I actually have the answers that I'm looking for. So it’s just a real powerful image. 

01:16:35
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER It sounds like… So how are you feeling about your decision to go into social work now? 

01:16:45
DALE I can feel great about it. 

01:16:45
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER You look like you feel very confident. 

01:16:50
DALE That’s great. 

01:16:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER As you just saw, the use of imagery can be very instrumental in helping clients gain insight and achieve peace. Another way to use spiritual imagery would be to assign clients homework in which they visualize themselves developing the positive qualities of characters from their own religious traditions. For example, a Hindu might practice visualizing the cultivation of the faithfulness of Hanuman, while for a Christian or Jew, it might involve visualizing the development of the obedience of Abraham or perhaps the patience of Job. 

01:17:30
R. CHARLES FAWCETT It is interesting to me the number of studies that have shown that imagining something is just as effective often as actually doing it. 

01:17:40
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Yes that… those studies are so impressive. I’ve also found that imagery can be very empowering for clients. Charlie at this point why don’t you tell us about the last letter, the T in sprit? 

01:18:00
R. CHARLES FAWCETT The T in the model is for Transgression Relief or we might say forgiveness for oneself and for others. Through transgression relief, we can help a client experience closure regarding someone who has wrong her or him. Commonly this relief would be in the form of forgiveness and/or reconciliation. In addition, we may help clients for themselves of guilt they may have for their own self-transgressions. 

01:18:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Charlie I noticed that you said forgiveness and/or reconciliation. 

01:18:30
R. CHARLES FAWCETT That’s right Radha. It is important to let our clients or patients know there is a distinction between these two concepts. Forgiveness is when a person who has been hurt gives up a resentment towards his or her wrongdoer. Reconciliation on the other hand is resuming the relationship with someone who has hurt us. So we may choose to forgive someone without reconciling with him or her or in some cases we may choose to reconcile with the offender but not forgive him or her. Sometimes these people aren’t ready to forgive someone, which is when the real healing work happens, but they need to reconcile with that person sort of abandoned for the time being. 

01:19:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER So that might be like somebody that we have to see on a regular basis like somebody we work with or a family member. And the feeling might be well I have to get along with this person but I am not going to forgive him or her. 

01:19:30
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Exactly. 

01:19:35
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER But Charlie, don’t a number of holy books say that it’s important to forgive? I’m thinking of holy books like the Bible, and the Talmud and the Hadeeds and the Dhammapada, don’t they say that we’re forgiven our transgressions as we forgive others. 

01:19:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT That’s absolutely correct. So not only it’s important to be sure that clients understand this distinction between the two terms, but there are also other frequent misconceptions about forgiveness that might even be cleared up. People often believe the wrongdoer, must apologize or change his or her behavior before they can be forgiven. We must remember that forgiveness only happens within the hurt person and does not require anything of the offender. Another misconception is that to forgive someone we condone or approve of his/her behavior. For example, a survivor of incest can forgive her perpetrator but obviously not approve of such grievous acts. And finally and maybe useful to remind clients they’re giving up a resentment does not mean they must forget what happened. I sometimes hear people who are clinging on to some old hurts say, but I don’t wanna forget. 

01:20:50
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER It might be useful to remind these people of the benefits of transgression relief. 

01:20:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT It’s good point Radha. On the one hand, there is a large by the research that demonstrate the harmful effects of anger and hostility . And on the other hand, studies have found that teaching forgiveness significantly reduces emotional symptoms such as hurt, anger and stress as well as physical symptoms such as dizziness, stomach pains, backache and muscle tension. 

01:21:25
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That’s impressive. But sometimes it’s hard to forgive. Why don’t you go for some strategies to help people with transgression relief in the forgiveness process? 

01:21:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Sure Radha. Of course some clients achieve catharsis just from telling about their experience but more can be gained from true forgiveness. When I’m working with a client on forgiveness, I first make sure the client understands the difference between forgiveness and reconciliation. Next I teach some clients cognitive and behavioral strategies. Relaxation techniques can reduce some of the physical symptoms they may be experiencing as a result of having painful thoughts about the offender. Other strategies are more cognitively based. It can be useful to remind clients that the pain they’re experience is from the thoughts and feelings they’re having, not from the actual event or events that occurred in the past. It can also be helpful to discuss what expectations clients have regarding the offender. Often we cling on to thoughts about how someone should have treated us. If clients can let go of these expectations it can aid in the healing process. Finally it can be useful to ask clients what they wanted from the offender. It might have been love, kindness, respect or some other unfulfilled need. If we can help clients find ways to get those needs met, this can focus energy away form the recollection of the pain created by the wrongdoer and toward another source that can meet those unmet needs. 

01:23:05
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER In this final vineyard(ph) you’ll see Charlie using a few of these techniques as he works with Shawnell on transgression relief. 

01:23:10
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Shawnell you had mentioned that you had never been able to forgive your father for abandoning you and your family when you were five. Is that something you’ll be willing to explore today forgiving him? 

01:23:25
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Sure. It’s just something that has been really hard for me to forgive him for. 

01:23:30
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmm…Hmm…What expectations did you have for your father? 

01:23:35
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD He should have stayed with the family, my mother and he should have supported us financially. It was his responsibility, his duty. 

01:23:45
R. CHARLES FAWCETT And what did he end up actually doing? 

01:23:50
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD He left us and he never communicated with us and never supported us. 

01:24:00
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Hmm…Hmm… So let me ask you this. Where is it written that he must support you into that? I mean I realize that is preferable that he did… but where is it written that he must do it that way? 

01:24:15
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Nowhere. 

01:24:20
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Okay. So what is that belief that he must do that? What does that cause you? 

01:24:25
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Pain, hurt. 

01:24:30
R. CHARLES FAWCETT So it might be something you’re willing to try to let go. 

01:24:35
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Yeah. 

01:24:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Okay. What I’d like to ask you to do is to meet with your church group that you mentioned and pray with them that God would help you to forgive your father. I’d also like you to do some homework, which will involve looking up the word forgiveness in the scriptures, okay. 

01:24:55
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Okay. 

01:24:55
R. CHARLES FAWCETT And just one last thing. You had um… mentioned that your father makes you sad and angry. Isn’t… isn’t there someone else in your life that you mentioned really that makes you sad and angry? 

01:25:10
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD Oh my gosh! My husband. I felt the same way about my husband. 

01:25:20
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Umm… So what do you think the connection might be? 

01:25:20
SHAWNELL WHITEHEAD I felt abandoned by him like I do my father financially. Did I marry my father? 

01:25:30
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That must have been an extremely powerful insight for Shawnell. But Charlie as hard as it is to forgive others sometimes it’s even more difficult to forgive ourselves. What about transgression relief to relief guilt... guilt in ourselves? 

01:25:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Well excellent point Radha. Often it is more difficult to forgive ourselves, but yet very necessary. The same principles can be applied to self-forgiveness. For example I’ll not be upset with myself or not having spent more time with the dying relative. Sometimes the expectations we have for ourselves are greater than those we have for others. If we can help clients realize the pain and the impact of not forgiving self this will often help start the process. And then asking them to outline their expectations for themselves is usually quite interesting. It often becomes a parent, they’re standing(ph) for themselves or unrealistically hard, much harder than they would hold for some other person. Finally asking clients to research forgiveness and the scriptural can be very fruitful and make a great homework assignment. 

01:26:45
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Self-forgiveness is a beautiful thing and probably most of us have quite a bit to forgive within ourselves. 

01:26:50
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Yes. As a matter of fact, so to Shawnell as it turned out, Shawnell’s anger toward her father and husband was only part of the story. Based on her religious beliefs she also felt tremendous guilt for not honoring her mother and father. As you may remember not only she mad at her father but also she was frustrated with having to care for her mother. And then the guilt was compounded by even thinking about divorce are really no-no because of her marriage covenant. So beyond doing mean forgiveness work with her father, I…Shawnell and forgiving herself and helped her to see that she had said impossibly high standards for herself. Shawnell was able to see that she was honoring her mother and I educated her that was normal to feel frustrated as a sandwich generationer. Finally I encouraged her to join support group for caregivers of aging parents and suggested couples counseling. 

01:27:55
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Charlie before we close, I think we need to briefly mention some ethical issues. 

01:28:00
Ethical Concerns and Concluding Thoughts 

01:28:00
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER There are a few ethical issues associated with the explicit integration of spirituality and therapy, the spirit part of their model. First it’s critical that we as helping professionals avoid imposing our own values. In addition we should never exceed our competency level when working with spiritual issues and counseling. It’s also important to carefully consider whether a spiritual intervention is appropriate especially for a severely disturbed client. 

01:28:35
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Clinicians should also avoid violating laws, governing separation of church and state. It’s important to avoid allowing bounders to become blurred or creating a dual relationship, for example being both a counselor and a spiritual director. 

01:28:50
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER Additionally psychotherapist should never attempt to assist other without working on their own spiritual development. 

01:29:00
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Which brings up an excellent point Radha. If for whatever reason, you found uncomfortable or worry that may be an ethical to explicitly integrate spirituality with your client, you can still work on the inner part of the model, the implicit interventions without the client ever knowing it. 

01:29:15
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER That’s right Charlie. 

01:29:20
R. CHARLES FAWCETT Well it looks like we’re out of time. We wanna thank you for spending these moments with us. And we both hope we’ve given you some ideas to think about and perhaps some methods of integrating spirituality into your work. 

01:29:35
RADHA J. HORTON-PARKER And although we’ve come to the end of the video, we hope that… it will be the beginning of something new. 

01:29:40
