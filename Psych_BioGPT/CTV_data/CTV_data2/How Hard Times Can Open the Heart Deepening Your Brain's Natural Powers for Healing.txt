Rick Hanson, Ph.D. 

00:00:20
RICK HANSON Thank you, Rich. When he started talking here I began getting terrified like, "What am I Bozo, the Clown? Clown jack, minister, go real I… making me pretty nervous there. So as usual with your penetrating insight acquired through what, 39 years of symposia, so that's another reason to come back so you could be more like Rich, right next year, that are more insightful and not too bad and playful. Uh… I'm really, really honored to be here and I'm umm… honored to be here in part because in my view, what we do day in and day out as therapists or related professions, coaches, healthcare professionals, educators, uh… mindfulness trainers, Human Resources Trainers and all the rest is a noble calling because we deal with the hard things in life, the classic hard things uh… like old age, disease and death, uh… systemic issues, poverty, discrimination, war, ordinary uh… personal tragedies uh… that are not so ordinary for being so tragic. And also we deal with the other things anxiety, stress, transitions, you know, teenagers sitting across from you at a dinner table give you that look, you know, the look. You know that one, large and small. We deal with it professionally out there and we deal with that in our own situation. And uh… we deal with the hard things, and I wanted to depart from kind of my normal state uh… if you're familiar with my work, this will be a little different, and it will include some experiential practice 'cause of course we are therapists, right? We do experiential things, so we'll have a little of that here as well this morning. Umm… I wanna talk about the hard things and using the hard things and tapping into our brains natural capacities to heal and to grow through hard things and to cope with them if nothing else in this presentation this morning with you. And umm… to introduce it, I'd like to start with a, an ancient story apparently an historically true story. A mother living in India 2,500 years ago lost her child and out of her mind with grief she went to the Buddha, and she said, "Please, please, Noble Sir, can you heal my child?" And he could see what was going on, and he said, "I can heal your child but you must bring me a mustard seed from homes that have not known disease, death, suffering, fear, loss and trauma, and I will take those mustard seeds to make a medicine for you." And so she goes from home to home to home looking for homes that have not known disease and death, not known great difficulty, not known personal pain uh… to get a mustard seed for me… from one of them, and she cannot find a single one, and realizing the common humanity of suffering, the common humanity of loss and difficulty and just challenges large and small. The very dignified personal struggle with issues that most people don't really know we're facing, recognizing that common humanity she's eased in her pain. It's like a soothing balm for her, and it sets her on her own personal path of awakening. So it's in that context that, that I'd like to explore with you these great issues of sorrow and pain, and how we cope with them, who among us has not known sorrow and pain, who among us has not known or is facing around the corner around the band some great difficulties, I certainly have. Uh… This is my father, this is my father William Broderick Hanson, I share his middle name as my first name, uh… born in a sod house in a ranch, the logging camp ranch in North Dakota, November 25th, 1918 and then who died six months ago on Halloween uh… three weeks or so short of his 97th birthday. At the end of a very long, very decent, very generous and very good life somewhere in there, he was a cowboy, a schoolteacher, a soldier uh… served as a weatherman in World War II and got interested in animals, uh… fishing game, acquired a PhD in zoology, became a professor and along the way raised three children. I'm the oldest of three and uh… married to his wife, my mother, Helen Hanson uh… for I think about 60 plus years. Uh… About nine months ago in the summer, last summer he developed some strokes and tipped into a series of health problems and those health issues combined with a lot of family drama, right? Who among us has not known family drama, you know, as well. Uh… created for me the tide for last place, most stressful two, three months of my life and also tide for first place as the most proud… profoundly heart opening important uh… growth producing time of my life as well. So it's from umm… those uh… lessons and that I'd like to speak to you today because it is Hemingway's words here "The world breaks everyone and afterward some are strong in the broken places." We're going to be broken. We are broken already. We work with people who've, who've been cracked, who have been broken by life routinely, but how can we help them and how can we help ourselves to get stronger, actually at the broken places? And that's what I'd like to explore with you here, uh… and as I said, well, along with a little practice for each one of these five major lessons here. I'm very interested in how we can engage this process, this soulful matter, this deep, deep emotional felt matter informed by modern science. Why not? why not draw on that uh… those uh… that material umm… especially modern science that has to do with the brain, the final common pathway of all the causes streaming through us, right now to make this moment of consciousness? For as the increasingly famous saying has it from the work of the Canadian psychologist, Donald Hebb, "Neurons that fire together, wire together." In other words our experiences leave lasting traces behind in changes of neural structure and function. This means that we can deliberately stimulate the underlying neural circuitry of wholesome states of mind, useful beneficial factors of coping and healing and growth and even if it's of interest, spiritual practice. And by stimulating the circuitry strength in it, like growing muscles for healing, and happiness, and love, and benefit for ourselves and other beings in this world. It's a wonderful opportunity using Modern Science, Modern Psychology, Modern Neuroscience informed by ancient contemplative wisdom to take skillful action inside your own mind where helping our clients or patients, whatever we call them, our children definitely uh… take skillful action inside the mind. They will gradually grow resources there that we can draw upon for our own sake and that of other beings. This is especially important because of what scientists call "The Negativity Bias," that we've evolved in our brain. And as I say it's like Velcro for bad experiences but Teflon for good ones. That's because our ancestors needed to really, really learn from their difficult painful experiences or potentially difficult painful experiences in order to live to see the sunrise. In a rule one, in the wild is eat lunch today, don't be lunch today, alright? And so uh… it's poignant on the one hand uh… we are designed through evolution, biological evolution to crave, to suffer to worry, to get angry, to feel disappointed and frustrated, to feel hurt and lonely, ashamed and aggressive toward others. We are designed to do that in order to live to see the sunrise and pass on genes that pass on genes. On the other hand the brain of each one of us, you, myself, everyone in this room umm… contains powerful natural forces that we can free, that can free us from this ancient programming and bring us home to a lasting peace and contentment and love even in the face of awful challenges. So this morning I would like to share with you five lessons that I acquired from like I said tied for last place the hardest time really in my entire life, which has had some hard times in it even before what happened with my father. And umm… go through each one and use them as opportunities to draw on the innate healing resources inside our own brain. So these are the uh… lessons here, it's like this. First dart, second dart, maybe yes, maybe no, tranquility and urgency and refuge. So let's get to it. Umm… The first one is it's like this, one thing that's so striking when you go through difficult times is what are you going to do with those experiences? Experiences so umm… intense, isn't it? It's so here, it's so immediate, you know, the feeling in the gut, when you get the bad news. Oh, dear. The shock and denial, the sweetness when you're feeding your father applesauce, who's too weak to lift a spoon to his mouth. Umm… the weariness in your legs and the pain in your back, uh… the gratitude for the kindness of others, it's like this, each experience is like this. What shall we do, with the piercing intimacy of our own experience? If we turn away from that uh… if we fight it, it just makes it worse or we lose opportunities to learn from that and to claim our own selves, to claim our own being in this moment and the next one. When we lean into our feelings instead, when we open to that the sadness, the anger, the doubt as well as the love, the gratitude, the awe, the mystery. There is a softening and an opening and a release. This is one of the three great ways to practice in my view. One of the three great ways to engage the mind skillfully for ourselves and for, for those we help which is to be with it, letting it be without trying to change it. It's as if the mind and brain were a garden, we simply see it, we witness it, we let it be as it is clearly as it is. And then there is the second great way to practice which is to let go, to release tension in the body, to let the feelings flow, to cry, to vent, uh… to yell out loud as you're driving home and for one more maddening day at the hospital, umm… to umm… you know, let go thoughts that make you crazy and make you suffer more than you need to, to abandon on wholesome desires to let go, in the garden of the mind pulling weeds. The second great way to practice and then there is the third great way to practice to grow, which is to let in, to open to, to create, protect and grow that which brings wellbeing and other benefits to yourself and others. In other words to plant seeds and grow flowers in the garden of the mind-brain system. When hard things happen, there's a natural flow that moves us through each one of these ways to practice. We start by letting be. Sometimes that's all we can do to, ride the wave, just try not to pour gasoline on that fire, try not to make a bad thing worse. Just ride it out. That's all we can actually do. And then at some point often it feels authentic to make a little effort in the mind, be a little deliberate, to release, to let go, let the feelings flow still liberally step back, disengage from some of those thoughts that uh… are, you know, problematic for us and other people. And then at some point after we've pulled a few weeds, it feels time to plant some flowers, to replace what we've released with something beneficial because as every gardener knows if you don't replace those weeds with something else, the weeds will keep coming back, alright? But we can't jump too quickly to pulling weeds and planting flowers as I've learned myself as someone who here uh… didn't want to feel those bad things. Uh… I was really good at pulling weeds and planting flowers but first I had to really learn to be with the garden of the mind otherwise pulling weeds or planting flowers doesn't have much traction, doesn't really uh… work very well. So to stay with our experience though, no matter how beneficial that is, is not always so easy. It's easier said than done especially when we're really upset. So this is where a little knowledge of the brain can be very helpful. So this is my first fancy slide Don't worry there will be no midterm about this material. Umm… This is an image of the brain and it shows that on the sides of the brain distinct from networks in the middle, these are the red blobs on the sides of the brain are these lateral networks on the right side for most people, right handed people roughly half of all left handed people uh… and these networks on the sides of your brain so actually support present moment on put awareness, staying with it letting it be just being with experience. You can actually stimulate and strengthen these lateral networks as studies show to support your ability and help your clients do the same to support the capacity to stay present in the moment umm… letting experience be. So I thought we could actually do a little thing right down, an experiential practice, a minute or two. It's all private if you want to think about your shopping lists or what you need to pack to get home, whatever it's really okay. No one will know umm… or you can, you know, check it out. So want to try right now and do a little practice here, right now? Okay. So two things that really help us activate these lateral moment networks, the first is to come into the present moment. So let's take a minute or so to do that. Letting go of the past, letting go the future. Tuning in, landing, letting time flow. Not trying to control it.

00:15:10
RICK HANSON Letting consciousness keep on streaming in this moment. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:35
RICK HANSON And second be aware of your body as a whole. Opening out into all the sensations of breathing in your torso. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:50
RICK HANSON Taking your torso as a whole. And then moving out to your body as a whole. 

00:16:05
[sil.] 

00:16:10
RICK HANSON Abiding as a whole body breathing. 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:30
RICK HANSON Attention not skittering from sensation to sensation but rather opening wide the spotlight of attention to include the whole body. Being and breathing. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:17:10
RICK HANSON Okay. Come on back. It's okay to continue experiencing your body as a whole or experience as a whole because that keep supporting that lateral mode, and as you repeatedly stimulate those neural networks that are the underlying basis for an experience of wholeness umm… you gradually strengthen them. And then with practice, with repeated practice something can remark… remarkable can begin to happen in terms of, of your relationship with experience all together. As you rest increasingly in letting the instable open receptive awareness you feel and recognize more deeply the nature of experience, experience itself distinct from the content of experience, the sound, the thought, the emotion, the sensation, the desire, and you start recognizing more and more that the nature of experience is to flow, has to pass away due to a vast web of causes arising in the next moment. Experiences being transient, a femoral also made up of many parts and having an insubstantial foamy quality to it, impossible to hold on to. Although actually were designed to keep trying. Uh… To function and survive and pass on genes that pass on genes the brain keeps trying to thinkify our experiences to reify them, to turn them into static little brick like things that can hold onto or control or push away. But this doesn't really work very well, does it? It's as if we're sitting on the edge of a waterfall in every single moment with time streaming by, our experience flowing by, continually trying to grab it, hold on to it, turn it into something else or keep it because it feels good. But that act itself creates so much of our suffering. Instead, we can let experience flow. Letting it pass away at the emergent edge of now continually booed by the next moment of arising. Umm… in that moment of rising to passing away. When we recognize the foamy impermanent nature of all experiences, even the worst ones, they don't hurt so much as they pass on through us. Then there is the next lesson I got, "First dart, Second dart." In life there are unavoidable physical emotional discomforts. No way of getting around them from subtle to excruciating what could be called the first darts in this life. The physical darts of illness, pain in the body, a headache, a backache, uh… My wife's grappled with chronic pain for quite some time, umm… the need to keep standing by a bed even though you really, really, really want to sit down, the weariness of driving back and forth from your home to a hospital, 50 miles away many times a week. And then there are of course the first darts that are social. That have to deal with being the most social species on the entire planet. The heaviness and hopelessness of seeing a loved one, irrevocably fade away. The bitter admits the sweet of compassion for a child you see wheeled down the hallway in a gurney with his red eyed father by his side, umm… the hurt from being yelled at by your sister, who is sick of your damn suggestions. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
RICK HANSON Then there are the second darts, the ones we throw ourselves. Uh… I'm kind of a specialist in second darts. Uh… The brain naturally reacts to what unpleasant rather than letting it be, you know, it's like this, instead of doing that uh… the brain reacts by fighting or fleeing or freezing or appeasing, that's all second darts. And a lot of these second darts that happened as I learned came from getting attached to our views and a certain outcomes, like I got really attached to my own views about what was important, about what was true and what was not true, whose fault it really was, that's an important one. I just want always want to know who to blame then I'm okay, I'm in peace, alright? My views about other people and my views about myself, I also got attached to outcomes, outcomes I couldn't control, like wanting a nurse to explain something the right way to my father uh… or wanting an apology from my sister or wanting the neural psyche about to make a particular recommendation. I also got attached to, I think we can all do, to what's happening inside the black box of that other person's mind, alright, really, really wanting to install umm… my module somehow in their motherboard. But, you know, how could you think this? Why don't you think that, alright? Understandable as this it is, it creates a lot of needless excess suffering in this process of getting caught up in our views, in our attachments to various outcomes is very much driven by the default mode network in the midline of your brain. That's for those red dots are concentrated in that top down view of the brain in the slide. Uh… That's what I call the simulator, you know, which is uh… where we tend to go when we are caught up in ruminating and dwelling on the past or obsessing about our future that we'd like. This simulator is one of the great evolutionary advances. It's probably one of the top II over the last several million years, in terms of neural evolution, the other being the adaptation of group living, as this profoundly social species. And the simulator is great. It breaks this out of the prison of the present. It enables us to reflect upon the past and imagine different alternative futures so we uh… can rehearse them and get ready for them and sort them out and figure out which ones would be best for us and others. But the simulator is also the neurological basis for rumination, hashing and rehashing, writing e-mails at 3 O'clock in the morning in your mind that you never actually send, thank goodness, going over events again and again and again, obsessing about this and that, you know, going over conversations what you could, what you wish you had said, why you can't believe they said that, right? Working on your case about those other people, you know, that inner prosecutor in your mind, that's banging on them or banging on you with self-criticism, finding fault with yourself or finding fault with others. What are we going to do? To interrupt this second dart process and to disengage from the simulator, we can draw on the brains a natural shock absorber, which is the felt sense of our needs actually already met so that we're not approaching life from a place of deficit or disturbance but rather from a place of fullness and balance. To summarize and go through a lot, a lot of material, it's a kind of a road map for this uh… idea of experiencing our core needs is actually already being met in an ongoing way. The brain evolved from the bottom up like building a house in three floors. You know, we have the reptilian brain stem for 600 million years of neural evolution and then we have the kind of mammalian sub cortex in the primate human, cortex on the top. And as the brain evolved so did its capacity to meet these three fundamental needs that every animal has including a big complicated human animal, needs for safety and satisfaction and connection as umbrella terms. I think there is some needs that don't fit neatly into that framework but most of what we need one way or another actually does. There's no getting around these needs. The only question is how, how do we go about meeting them? Even when things are hard and painful, when there are real challenges, real first darts to our need for safety and satisfaction and connection we can still feel a fullness in the core of our being, a sense of calm strength even when we're threatened in terms of safety. A sense of gratitude and accomplishment in our core underneath it all even when we're frustrated in terms of our need for satisfaction and a sense of compassion and worth inside even when others treat us badly, in terms of our needs for connection. In effect, we can stay centered in a good place deep down inside, I call it "The Green Zone" uh… as opposed to the Red Zone when the world is flashing red or the world inside the mind so that we can stop throwing second darts and stop making hard things even harder. To repeat… to do this how do you grow a green zone brain? In a way, that's what we do for a living. A major pathway into the this is to repeatedly look for our little opportunities as Rich said in his introduction for me, little opportunities in everyday life to experience that your core need or core needs are already met in some way, little authentic experience as in the flow of your day of safety or satisfaction or connection and as you do this, since neurons that fire together wire together through really marinating in and taking in the good of these ordinary experiences of core needs met, you gradually build up an increasingly unshakable, unconditional, not based on conditions outside you or inside you and unshakable, unconditional core of inner peace and contentment and love. To put this in a way that's a little silly but for me is really memorable, we need to repeatedly pet the lizard in terms of their brainstem like sense of safety, we need to repeatedly feed the mouse in terms of uh… those sub cortical networks that are involved especially in experiences of satisfaction and of course we need to hug the monkey, to feel more connected. Gradually building up the circuits of a green zone brain. So I thought we could do this right now for maybe a minute or so each, you know, for that. Okay. I'm very fond of lizards so I wanna start by petting the lizard. So I'm gonna offer a few prompts, I'll just do it for about a minute each. Normally I take considerably longer but uh… that's the setting here, just for a minute or so. So if you can, right now look for legitimate opportunities to feel as safe as you reasonably can. Most of us are much more anxious moment to moment than we naturally need to be. Looking for opportunities to recognize that your inner protected setting, letting go of needless anxiety. Finding a sense of strength inside so that even if there are challenges there's a sense of confidence in being able to meet them. 

00:28:25
[sil.] 

00:28:35
RICK HANSON Any signs of threat level orange passing away. Opening into and enjoying a growing internal sense of safety and peace. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:20
RICK HANSON And then letting whatever sense of calm or strength or peace is present, move to the back of the mind and focusing now on feeding your inner mouse. Not chasing, not straining rather opening to authentic experiences of gratitude. Gladness, thinking of things that bring a little smile. For me, it could be our children or to all the meadows in Yosemite park and good times with friends. A sense of fullness already, you're in now. 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:35
RICK HANSON And then letting whatever sense of satisfaction or fullness is here move to the back of the mind and focusing on hugging your inner monkey. If you like seeing that there are four monkeys in that picture, a little baby monkey in the center there. Bringing to mind being secured about you and those you care about to. Love flowing, in love flowing out, it's love either way. 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:10
RICK HANSON Finding your warm-heartedness, your compassion for others, your kindness and your good wishes for others, for all beings including yourself. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:31:45
RICK HANSON Okay, start coming back. This is become a very important practice for me to look for those little opportunities in everyday life again and again and again, to feel authentically safe and authentically satisfied and authentically loved and loving as well, and as we do this increasingly, we can rest more and more in the green zone even as we deal with the hard things in life. Then there was the third lesson for me, maybe yes, maybe no. The brain is a jumbo prediction machine, constantly forming expectations of what the next moment will be like and then matching the next moment against those expectations. But you just don't really know, do you? You know, one of the things I saw again and again and people that spend a lot of time in healthcare environments or in the families of a loved one with a chronic illness is that they knew they didn't know, since I know for a living and I'm trained to know for a living, it was a great lesson for me to keep disengaging from my knowingness as it were. Uh… This treatment might work or it might not. Uh… My wife would tell me things with great certainty, and I would know in my heart she just didn't know 'cause I didn't know, no one knew. You might be able to get your down off the ventilator, maybe not. Uh, you don't know what's true until you actually know it's true with other people they might see the things the way you want them to or they might not. Even something as important as how long we live, we don't know. You know, each one of us will cross this line some day when we have a year to live, and we don't know when that day will come. It may have already come for some of us in this room, perhaps me, and then there are 364 days left, 363 and eventually two and eventually one, maybe yes, maybe no. I've got friends who are in a couple and when they say goodbye to each other in the morning, see you later, they actually realize they take a moment to register they may actually never see each other again, not in a morbid sense, not in a bomber sense but really out of appreciating who they are with and the realities of life. It's hard to live with this uncertainty, with all the question marks, but if we fight the fact of not knowing for sure, we just make things worse. So I've got a couple suggestions here about this. To allow this not knowing, to be brave enough, to live with this fundamental uncertainty in life it's really helpful to tune into the signals coming up into the brain from within the body which is where roughly 80% certainly the great majority of the information coming into the brain originates from inside ourselves not from outside ourselves. Most of those signals are like the calls of a night watchman saying again and again and again. All is well, all is well. Not all is perfect, uh… but you're going on being your core is intact, you're basically alright right now. There's enough air to breathe, the internal organs are working, no shark is chewing on your leg uh… you know, you're not in a moment of agonizing pain, uh… there's not a moment of terrible loss. It's probably not a great moment, you know, your back could be sore and to be worried about something where you're a bit irritated about something, but you're basically okay. You may not have been basically okay in the past, you may not be basically okay in the future but in this moment, in this moment and this one and this one sitting there right at the waterfall, you're still basically alright right now, and when we register this, when we open to this remarkable fact right under our noses most of the seconds of most of the years uh… of most people's lives umm… it helps us tolerate uncertainty and live in the present moment without trying to control and predict it so much. So I thought we could do this as well. This is one of my personal favorite practices to tune into the actual fact in this moment in this ballroom that you're basically alright right now. You want to try it? Here we go. Take a moment. Recognize the truth. It's not pie in the sky, I don't believe in positive thinking, I believe in realistic thinking, seeing what's true, the whole mosaic of reality, including those tiles of reality that were basically okay in this moment. Keep helping yourself recognize. You're breathing, there's a going on being, going on living now and now. 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:45
RICK HANSON There might be a sense of relief. How wonderful? I am actually not dying in this moment. 

00:36:55
[sil.] 

00:37:10
RICK HANSON I'm basically alright right now. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:30
RICK HANSON It's kind of amazing, isn't it? Okay, under the fourth lesson, tranquility and urgency. All the great uh… contemplative traditions of the world value tranquility. You know, a mind increasingly like a quiet pond unshaken, unruffled so we can see what's happening inside it really, really clearly. There is also the tranquility, the inner stillness that we can find even in the midst of action. We can be tranquil in our core even as we are externally really, really busy. But the wisdom traditions of the world also emphasize a sense of urgency that life is short, death is certain, and each day is a gift, an opportunity for practice for healing and for growing the good inside ourselves and others. As they say in Tibet if you take care of the minutes the years will take care of themselves. I found out there was the saying from places besides Tibet as well, if you take care of the minutes, the years will take care of themselves. What's the most important minute of your life? I think it's the next one and the next one after that because that's the one that we have some influence over. Once it is gone we can never get it back. Will you waste what is good in it, as I certainly have with many of the precious minutes of my own life or will you recognize the good in this minute or can we help our clients, our students, our patients, our children recognize the good in the next minute, in the most important minute of their life minute after minute? And open to it in an intimacy with our own body, our own experience letting whatever is good there, gradually sinking and fill the hole in the heart. I've been thinking about the same from sailing throughout the time with my father and since you have all the time in the world until you have no time at all, alright. Uh… No more time to say what's in your heart to someone who's passed away, no more time to repair how you parented a teenager who will not repair with you as an adult, no more time to say the words that matter because your stroke has blown out the circuits speech in your brain, no more time to nudge treatment in a better direction for someone you love or tell someone how much they matter to you, no more time to write that poem, take that class, get that license or send your book proposal to the publisher. Why do we not make use of what's available to us in the most important of our life again and again and again? What makes us swerve away from speaking from our heart saying the things that matter or taking the actions that matter most even though the clock is ticking day after day after day? I found for myself it's usually because I don't want to risk some kind of dreaded experience, all right, and so I back away, swerve away from the possibility of that kind of pain. Maybe that dread… that dreadful experience happened when you were young for real, it really did happen or maybe you saw it happen to somebody else or you knew or imagined that it could happen to you, and now today to avoid this tragic experience the brain very quickly protects us and it within seconds or even milliseconds swerves the supply from that full self expression. Sometimes, there's a good reason to be careful and avoid that dreaded experience but most of us, speaking for myself certainly, most of the time played smaller and safer than we really need to kind of like walking around in a suit of armor, it's three sizes too small, made sense in childhood but it's really constricting for us today. To deal with this there's a wonderful way to use the brains machinery of emotional memory to clear out those dreaded experiences and to live and think and speak and act more freely. This is the matter of being aware of both positive and negative at the same time so that the positive, which could simply be the space of open spacious untroubled awareness so that the positive gradually associates with the negative in the moment in your awareness since neurons that fire together wire together the positive gradually easing and soothing and potentially even where there's only a green ball in the, in the jar uh… replacing that negative entirely. That's a first very skillful useful thing to do, very central to much therapy, and then there's a second opportunity shown to us increasing with the science of the reconsolidation of memory, this window of reconsolidation in which immediately after doing this linking of positive and negative what you do is you just experience only the positive and associate that positive to whatever course of action you want to encourage and in so doing you disrupt what's called "The Window Of Reconsolidation." You literally block the re-in-coding, the re-wiring of that negative material, back into uh… the underlying fabric of the brain. So I want to do that little practice with you right now if you'd like to, to bring to mind something that you know you'd like to encourage in yourself but you've been swerving away from it, maybe it's speaking truth to power in a certain way, maybe it's being one step more vulnerable in a difficult relationship, maybe it's going back to your sister and trying to, you know, make one more effort to heal things there, uh… maybe it's to really start that blog, you know, or as a writer myself get going, send that proposal out. You never know until you cast your bread upon the waters. So if you like right now for a moment bring to mind, something you'd like to encourage and also bring to mind uh… it going realistically well with realistic rewards, good feelings uh… for yourself and for other people. Can all be quiet here for some moments as you just kind of marinate in this sense of what you want to encourage? Only the positive, disengaging from the negative. Associating what you'd like to encourage with realistically anticipated rewards.

RICK HANSON I think this is one of the great mental health skills to be able to imagine a realistically positive future, imagining the rewards associated with it, and if we use this skill for the first half hour or so after we engage negative material during that half hour or so roughly window of reconsolidation, we can actually disrupt the re-coding of negative material and become more and more willing to risk the dreaded experience. And then in the last few minutes here, I'd like to talk about the fifth lesson for me, the lesson of refuge. Life is often a hard trail and hopefully it's also a long one. Uh… To walk at all to walk it with joy and peace and love we all need refuges, people, practices, places and things that fuel us, that protect us, that repair us to give us sanctuary. Refuge is like finally getting home after a long day at the hospital and being able to sleep next to your wife. Refuge is like a chocolate chip cookie, a hot shower, a quiet sunset or a poem from David Whyte. Also a classic refuge's like the community of fellow practitioners or wisdom teachings or great teachers or reason and science, what feeds your own heart, what are some of the important refuges that had meant a lot to you, and how could you spend more time in them? One of the great refuges, of course, is other people or relationships all together including our own sense of loving us. Uh… As I've said we're the most social species on the planet and the sense of love is the primal refuge. It's the universal medicine because it meets all three of our needs. It's a fundamental signal of safety, uh… it's also very rewarding and, of course, love broadly defined uh… connects us with others. Uh… This is of course an image of Mr. Rogers, Fred Rogers. He says here "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, "Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping." Alright. One of the more remarkable YouTube videos you can find is Mr. Rogers accepting an Emmy Award uh… for lifetime achievement uh… after saying a few obligatory things he looked around the room, and he reminded all the fancy people there, all the makeup, all the plastic surgery, all the fancy dresses, and suits, and tuxedoes, and jewelry, and all the beautifully massed people in the room that they were each there because someone had loved them into being, and then he said, he was brave enough to say, "And I'd like to ask you to take 10 seconds now on national television to remember someone who has loved you into the end" and you could see in the faces, you can watch it on YouTube, it's amazing. The initial shock and defensiveness "Oh, my God, this is really happening here" and then as these ten long beautiful heart touching seconds ticked by the masks began to fall and the tears began to flow. So I'd like to invite you right now as we finish up to consider who has loved you in to being. Mr. Rogers asked his audience to take just 10 seconds but because we're therapists, we're hardcore I'll take 60 seconds here, and as Mr. Rogers said I'll keep time. So for 60 seconds who has loved you into being?

RICK HANSON And for another minute who have you loved into being?

RICK HANSON Love is a great refuge. As we as therapists and those in related professions know it's other people and as the theme of this conference and the symposium points out it's through attachment and through establishing a sense of secure base inside ourselves and in our relationships and in the world all together. We're able to be truly creative to go forth into the future with courage as Bernie Brown says, during greatly connected to those around us including those in the room right now. The people sitting next to you on your left, on your right, in front of you and behind you and all around you as a phenomenal refuge, and I would like to express now my own gratitude to all of you as a refuge for me, individually and collectively and also express my gratitude to one of my great benefactors Rich Simon, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ah, Good, heart.
