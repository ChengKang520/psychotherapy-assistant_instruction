UNKNOWN In these series we are allowed the privilege of seeing the therapist-child interaction. And feeling the emotions generated in an initial play therapy session with a child, from the moment of entering the play room, to ending the session. We recognize and applaud the courage of these play therapists, in allowing us to video tape their spontaneous interactions with a child. These are not planned experiences, there is no script. They are spontaneous interactions that allow us a unique view into each therapist's typical approach to a child play therapy. These play therapists were eager to share their experiences, in hopes that you will learn more about play therapy, children, and yourself. In this video you will see Dr. Viola Brody. Founder of Developmental Play Therapy. Dr. Brody is a registered play therapy supervisor, and is nationally recognized as one of the leading pioneers in the field of play therapy. She is the Author of the Dialogue of Touch, Developmental Play Therapy. And has presented workshops throughout the United States, and in Ireland, London and Canada. Dr. Brody believes a child who experiences being touched, develops a sense of self. The intent of touching the child then, is to bring about a fruitful dialogue between the therapist and the child. Following the play therapy sessions, Dr. Brody is interviewed by Dr. Garry Landreth Director of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas.

An Interview With 

00:32:55
Dr. Viola Brody 

00:32:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Good morning Dr. Brody, and welcome to the Center for Play Therapy's interview series with distinguished professionals, who have made a significant contribution to the field of play therapy. We are delighted to have you with us this morning. Uh, for the uh, person who may not be familiar with developmental play therapy, could you briefly summarize uh, a description of what it is. 

00:33:20
DR. VIOLA BRODY Okay, well, what it is, is um, my basic goal then then I did have a goal. My basic goal is to help the child develop an inner self. A core self that’s inside here. And the way you do it is through a relationship. Its through touch and, and in order to have touch you have two people. Because touch is different than just physical contact. Touch is a communication between two. There is a toucher, and the one touched. And as you touch you are communicating without words. Uh, you send a message to what it is. And the one touched gets a message back of what the sender giving you. You become a part. When you touch someone, Montihue says, when you touch someone you become a part of the one you touched. And when you are being touched by someone you become, you become a part of the other. And so, so, that’s very very, that’s very true. And you don’t need any interpretations, it’s very clear, the message is very clear. You don’t need even any words. You can tell that the people in the workshop when I had then just simply hold hands and do nothing we amazed at what uh, the message they got back and forth and the feeling of the energy, just the feeling of the energy. if your body is tense and your touching somebody, you’re not wanting to with that person very well. And the child knows it from the mother right away. So when they feel, the basis of it is, when they feel the touch, they have to feel it. Schizophrenics don’t feel it and neither do autistics. But, so, you have to touch them a little, uh a little firmer to get them to feel it. When they feel it, they feel the energy in their body, they feel alive, and they feel they exist. They are real, I am here, here I am. The very first things that infants start saying when they start, is here I am see me. See, and so and then there is a pleasurable sense of that feeling. Golly, I am alive, and when that is pleasurable, so, first you have the feeling of their body, and that they are here, and then there is a um, the experience of emotion, its pleasurable. It has to be pleasurable. So they want more of it. SO, they reach out, they want to be touched again. SO they start the attachment process right there. And you see it in Melanie's film, do it again, do it again. So you know, and kids say do it again. So you start that attachment process and so, the goal in my program is to make my presence felt in a way um, that the child feels his physical body, and I try to find a way that is pleasurable for him. I am very much against these holding therapies, that just hold the kids forever. Like them, they scream and holler, I don’t, I don’t have preplanned sessions that this is what we are going to do in this session. But I do have a plan, that sooner or later I am working in the direction for him to feel his body through touch, and to let him trust me enough that he would let me hold him. And when any children get to that place, they move. They move like no one’s business. They start, they start talking and verbalizing. 

00:36:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, you are really sensing the child's lead. When they are 

00:36:35
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right, um, but sometimes, they are not, sometimes you have to help them being ready by initiating it. And I initiate it in small doses to find what's acceptable for them. But if I don’t start it, they are not going to initiate. If they never had that touch, they are not going to initiate it. SO, I have to initiate it to give them that experience. 

00:37:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Uh, a minute ago you mentioned the, uh, importance of the relationship. Could you say a bit more about that? 

00:37:05
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, uh, so through the touch, and wanting to be touched, they develop a relationship. You cannot, since there is a communication between two people, that communication is a relationship, is a relationship. And what it is is really like a parent child relationship. I am in it, I am not sitting observing them, I am within the process. I am in the relationship so I am not sitting there interpreting, It is very interactive. So, in the beginning I initiate it, but sooner or later the child begins to, they will initiate it. So then I I am really doing more responding to it, rather than initiating it. But I add, I always am in there. I am always adding my two cents worth. My contribution. And then I, um, then I move as the child moves, as he begins to get a sense of who he is and wants to show he has some power, I behave in a way that he feels his power. And um, so, I am there, for him to, or wait so then, hers the, first the child becomes very attached to you, and um, threes nothing you do that they can’t see. When they become attached to you, you know, really, it’s like a symbiotic relationship. For, in one stage, they go back to their infant period and, I don’t, I don’t like calling it regression, I call it going back to the beginning and picking up something they need and bring it forward. And when they do, they immediately move to where, the age they should be. When they get that, when Melanie in that film behaved like a little infant, even in the same hour she came out of doing that, to being um, more like a four year old and I need, she doesn’t want to stop the hour, I need more of this, it’s not enough what I'm getting, I mean, its verbalized. Um. 

00:39:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, the child will go back to recover what they need. 

00:39:00
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right. 

00:39:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And then come forward to here and now. 

00:39:05
DR. VIOLA BRODY You have to allow them to be this baby, and they are not pretending, in the beginning. Allow to be there and be this baby. and, so later on when, see, where the value of this comes is that um, later on they can pretend and they can use some symbols and things. You can’t pretend something that you haven’t been. Because in the beginning of the sessions she is the baby, but in the end she says pick me up and carry me, and pretended I'm your tiny baby. So then you know, when they get upset or something, they are not, not with their mother or somebody they know, they can sit and imagine where they are. So they could hear their own selves, quiet their own selves. By remembering that place, see. But the experience has to be there first or else there is nothing there to remember. And it’s in the body, its where the body remembers it. But, in terms it’s a relationship all along. I mean I just agree with you focus of folkies that therapy for me is a relationship. I'm not sitting trying to get the child some insight, and there is nothing wrong with them. I am not saying what's wrong, that’s not what I do, sit and analyze his behavior. We are creating something new between us. So then the child copies me. She learns, she learns because she is attached to me, whatever I do she learns. So I can move her up to another high stage 'cause she. When I began to write some words under the drawings, she says she is going to write something too. See. 

00:40:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So this is a very alive process. 

00:40:40
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right, right. 

00:40:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And I get the feeling as I listen to ya, you’re a very warm kind of process. 

00:40:45
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, it is, it’s very exciting. And you, you learn so much so it is a very intimate relationship. And intimacy is just really being present. Totally present with the other. And you get as much out of it as the child does. I mean that you are seen by that child like no one’s business. And when you are trying, when you make the child feel safe, so it goes both ways. 

00:41:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Dr. Brody, in, in your book you describe um, um many specific techniques that can be used in your approach. What caution would you have for the play therapists who, who perhaps just focuses on picking up some of those techniques and then then doesn’t build the relationship? 

00:41:35
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, um, that’s a wonderful question. Its important 'cause I wanted to, I wanted to emphasize that, too. And if somebody doesn’t remind me, sometimes I forget. And that is, one of the big things that we learn in doing training, is in the beginning, mostly what we focused on is helping them do, focus on the child. These are things that you so with a child. And we did one way mirror rooms. And did things like that, but the focus is what to do with child. But we didn’t wait very long before we realized, for our kind of approach, and I think it’s true for other approaches also, the adults in training need to experience themselves uh, what it is that they want the child to experience. So, in a program of focus on touch, they need to experience what it’s like to touch, and to be touched. And the people in the workshop yesterday, when we simply just sat and help hands, they were so amazed of what they, what they got out, what it feels like. They had no idea, some of them said, that that’s what it's like. Because we shake hands a lot, like we shake hands, we say hello, you know and that’s it, and I say glad to see you, and that’s it. You know. But, I bet they'll never shake hands again. Like immediately when you did, because I do it. I felt the why, we don’t feel the, especially meeting new people we don’t feel, we don’t feel the energy in the other persons hand. What kind of a person they are, and that that might have anything to do with whether you like that person or not. Like, like I immediately experienced you have a very warm hand, and you grasp very firmly. Like you sort of meant that you wanted to, wanted to um, meet me. And, and yet you didn’t grab me so hard that it hurt my hands. And I have people that squeeze my hand, uh, at my age, it sometimes, you don’t have to squeeze too hard and it really hurts my hand. But they do that, and you didn’t do that. Se, so look how much I got out of you. What kind of a person you are. Just from that, even though we didn’t spend much time doing it. 

00:43:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, you are always coming back to the relationship. You may emphasize uh, a technique that can be used, but it seems to me uh, what I hear you saying is, that’s based on the relationship. 

00:44:00
DR. VIOLA BRODY Exactly, that’s how you get the relationship, that’s how you know that you are related. And like I would, like, like I would like to know you more from just shaking hands with you, and um, so you develop the relationship, and it, it becomes um, more abstract in a way. But there is this feeling of, of, you really love the child that you are working with. And there is a feeling against that And there certainly is in some places. You are not supposed to allow yourself to feel that, and, uh so the relation comes up sooner or later. 

00:44:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Dr. Brody, in your book, The Dialogue of Touch, you wrote that a child who experiences herself as touched, develops a sense of self. What did you mean by that? 

00:44:50
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, a sense of self is the inner part of you that guides you, tells you what you need, that takes care of you. It’s the I part in the beginning, it’s the ego part. And in the beginning it begins with your body, like Freud says there is a body ego first. But, to be aware that you have a voice inside of you. And, and so when a child begins to have that, they begin to use the pronoun I also. Um, like when I started with her, she never um, never could say anything that she wanted. All she did was um, rule and uh, control other people. All she did was react to the outer world, instead of starting from the inside out. After, she, after the first, uh, session three with her, from then on, what she did was from the inside out. Do it again, when I did the touching, she says do it again. And it was a game that I, a game that I created. And in the book I have a series of games, but they weren’t really games in the beginning, they were things that I did to help a child. I said well, here's a way to say hello. Um, can I demonstrate it on you? Okay, it goes like this. This is her favorite game. Now, when I count music, there is a song in the kindergarten book that says, knock at the door, peek in, lift the latch and walk in. So, I made that a game, and I said it goes like this. Knock at the door, peek in, lift the latch, and walk in. I never put my finger, people ask me, I never put the finger in, well I just, like that. So, I make it, really as symbolic play, 'cause if the mouth is shut, its oh no, the door is shut, nobody is home. 

00:46:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH This sounds very tender. 

00:46:50
DR. VIOLA BRODY See, so then she would say do it again. And, and then it could, it was creative on her part and creative on my part also. Cuz, after she would keep her mouth shut, then I would say well nobody is home. So, another thing I would say to therapists is if it gets boring to you, what you do, do something else. Cuz, if it is boring to you, it will be 'cause sometimes she would just say the same thing. So, I would say well, my goodness, here I came to play with her, see already I am up into fantasy in a way, but I am using her body instead of a doll, see, or something else. I walk around her head, I wrap around the eye, I walk around the yard, and after a while maybe she will be home. And she'll say well, walk around again and maybe I'll be home. So she gets the touch again, see. So, uh. 

00:47:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, you are very much in contact with the, with the person of this child. 

00:47:45
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right, right. 

00:47:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Through the physical touch. 

00:47:45
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right. 

00:47:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Dr. Brody, is it possible for a child to be touched in a best sense of the word, and yet not feel touched? 

00:48:00
DR. VIOLA BRODY Um, yes you can. You could, they could be um, autistic children, some schizophrenic children, you can put your hand on them and they, they don’t feel it. Um, and it may be true with sexually abused, some of them too. Um, so, in those cases then you have to work with a touch um, in a, of giving, if they will do it. In a different way, like a take your hand, and you don’t feel it, see. I'd say, well can you squeeze my hand, see how hard you can squeeze my hand. And I squeeze it a little harder so it’s like, you know, but they are doing it with me. Until they begin to feel. Like, you can feel your muscles squeeze like that, um, I demonstrated this yesterday in the workshop, and there was one autistic boy that I had, he was six years old when I started which was, he was too old to even start but, he is totally autistic, and um, he wasn’t toilet trained even, he was just nothing. He had two behaviors. One, he would stare and not do anything, and it was this kind of stuff all the time, or else he would race from one end of the room and tear the curtains off, and that kind of stuff. But, in the very first session, I just watched him, his mother was there, he was very handsome, autistic children are beautiful children, they are like dolls, so one day when he one time he ran by me, and I grabbed his hand, like I grab your hand, and he pulled, 'cause if he pulls away, I don’t know what the term is now, but you pull, okay, so I hold it for a minute. Then I let go, and then he runs around the room again, and then, he comes back and gives me his hand. Now if you, and he pulled again, now you pull, and tell me what you feel. tell me what you feel right now. 

00:49:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I feel um, some strength from you. 

00:49:55
DR. VIOLA BRODY Yeah. 

00:49:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, and also, you, your willing to come with my pulling. 

00:50:00
DR. VIOLA BRODY Yes. And, when you pull do you feel- 

00:50:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I feel my strength. 

00:50:05
DR. VIOLA BRODY Do you feel these muscles? Do you feel these muscles tense? 

00:50:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Yes, yes. 

00:50:10
DR. VIOLA BRODY And do you feel your hand? Grabbing hard? So, you feel these muscles, see. So he begins to feel some life. He feels me, but he also feels his own muscles. 

00:50:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH He feels his own life. 

00:50:20
DR. VIOLA BRODY See, and everyone that I do with that, they don’t feel, they don’t feel that tenseness until I draw their attention to it. But that’s what he felt, that’s why he came around. Even though he pulled away again, as if he didn’t want it, but you don’t know what it is. 

00:50:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So he's discovering a part of himself, the person. 

00:50:35
DR. VIOLA BRODY That’s exactly. 

00:50:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH The self. 

00:50:35
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right. And so from then on I had um, one thing that I did with him that he initiated, he hadn’t, he didn’t have any speech, but I would play my slippery, I invented my slippery hand game since he liked that. So, you have to keep your presence, so I had brought some lotion and I put the lotion all on his arm, and then I tell him, I tell him to pull. He didn’t understand what the word pull is. But, I am going up his arm like this, and then I say, okay, pull, so in the beginning, I have to slide my hand through because he doesn’t understand what to do. But after a while he does. So when he does I make it a game. I make everything a fun game, so it’s not like sitting and doing a massage. It’s not a medical treatment, so I said pull your arm, oh, you’re getting away, you’re getting away, your losing, you’re getting away, you’re getting away, you’re getting away oh, you’re getting away, oh, oh, you’re just about to let go. Aw, look you let go. And see, that’s, and then he holds his hand up, he wants it again. So, for a while- 

00:51:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Because its pleasurable. 

00:51:30
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right, its pleasurable, he feels that. And, he um, for several sessions, after he came in, he still doesn’t talk, but he's already got a little bit of an inner self because he, he takes the bottle of lotion, he hands it to me, and he takes his shoes and socks off, and he wants me to do, and he holds out his hands, and he wants me to do his hands and his feet. So he is communicating. And to this day, this boy is in his 20s one of the things he still wants his mother to do when she visits him is to play his feet game. It’s still there. 

00:52:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So important. 

00:52:10
DR. VIOLA BRODY Yeah. 

00:52:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Dr. Brody, uh, also in your book, you emphasized that the intent of touching the child is to bring about a fruitful dialogue between an adult therapist and a child. What did you mean by that? 

00:52:25
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, um, when I shook your hands, like if I, if I take your hand, you know, um, you can tell um, what can you, what can you tell about me from just holding my hands for a minute? 

00:52:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Uh, that you are uh, you’re comfortable, um, you’re not resisting, um, your easy to be with. And, also, there is some strength there in you that is not being exerted. I sense that. 

00:53:10
DR. VIOLA BRODY Okay, alright. And, from you uh, I feel a great deal of warmth in your hand, and if I am really still I can feel a little, I can feel a little vibration. I have to be still in order to be able to feel it, you can feel the little vibrations around the edge of my hand, and yours and my hand tends to get warmer, as I hold it. So, its saying, in one way or another, you don’t have words, as I be here with you, I am here with you you’re, and you’re here with me. Now, what some of the people, so, so, there is a communication there. 

00:53:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, this is the dialogue. 

00:53:50
DR. VIOLA BRODY That’s the dialogue, That is the dialogue. And it’s there without uh. So, supposedly, supposedly, your one of these acting out kids, that doesn’t want anything to do with me. So, pretend if I just touch you, and you and you pull back or indicate, so, supposedly you are one of these and I said, oh, you brought your hand here, did ya? Right, so what’s the communication right there. 

00:54:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH A very powerful message that, uh, I don’t either trust you or want you to do that. 

00:54:25
DR. VIOLA BRODY Alright, so see, the touch is a communication, right there. I touch you, and it’s like you don’t want it. For whatever reason, leave me alone, or whatever. So, that means there is a dialogue. 

00:54:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, it is a dialogue of touch. 

00:54:40
DR. VIOLA BRODY Right. 

00:54:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH That is in some way similar to the dialogue of verbal communication, but it is the touch communication. And, what I hear you describing is a more powerful message. 

00:54:55
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, it’s the basic one, it’s the basic one. It’s the first kind of communication. If there is not a non verbal communication like this, those children to not really develop verbal communication. they don’t do it, they may talk, and they may even learn to read, but their talking they are not there. They are not in, they are not their bodies when they are talking, and when they read they don’t make any sense out of it because they have no images that go with the words. You see? So, if you looked at the pictures as a child, of a, two people holding hands or something, or doing something in a picture book, you already have the image in your body. Oh yeah, you know, you don’t say that consciously, but oh, yeah I know what that means. Because that is what my mother and I do and my father and I do this together, you know. 

00:55:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Dr. Brody, what age group would you, would developmental play therapy be appropriate for? 

00:55:50
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, um, some of this body focusing on touch, on body emphasis, on some level, and some instances is good for all of them. All of them. Because sometimes you have some very bright kids, highly intelligent, with high IQs, but they are depressed, they don’t have much ego, and self esteem, um, some of them even are, like that, they don’t even know it, you have these kids that can commit suicide. It’s because they are not aware of their own inner aliveness. And those kinds of kids would benefit tremendous by some. They wouldn’t need a lot of it, but I think my view is you need some of this as long as you live. And that the, 'cause you do it, you know? And, um. 

00:56:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So a therapist could readily use this uh, with um, with eight to ten year olds, and perhaps even older. Dr. Brody, are there particular uh, problems that you think developmental play therapy is more appropriate for, or is do you recommend your approach across the board? 

00:57:00
DR. VIOLA BRODY Well, I recommend a little bit across the board. But there are people, children now, that I think um, are really needing it, I think it’s about the only thing that they, that will do the trick of starting them into go at least these um, attachment problem children, these children that have cocaine babies and born with alcoholic mothers. And they don’t have any parents. They don’t have any parents. The mothers are on drugs or are in jail, they don’t get any parent. That, that is really that’s really, really basic that they, they need. That I don’t think anything else uh, will take its place. But they need somebody to be with them. They need a mother someplace. Uh, so just being one hour, just being one hour a day with therapy, that isn’t going to do it for those kids either. If you could train people in day care centers to do this, that you have a holding period, a rocking period, that they spend every, each day 'cause they come every day, if you have some adults that would do that. And, there are some adults that are skilled and willing to do it and, do have, would like to do it if the atmosphere was more amenable or they felt safe in doing it. We need to do that, and there is a movement in this country toward accepting touch, that touch is, is, uh, is something that is needed. I think that child abuse has made us aware of the way touch that, touch is communication. And um, just because some people are inappropriate and, and abuse children, doesn’t mean that you should deprive all children of something like this, if they need. So, um, there's, there's a movement toward helping children get in touch with their bodies. And then training people for it, and what it means. 

00:58:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Does your approach vary with the age or problem of the child? 

00:59:00
DR. VIOLA BRODY Oh, sure it does, um, I've done it with teenagers but I don’t recommend people off the hand. They, it’s another problem with the teenagers. Um, but, uh, some form of body contact, and it has to be appropriate. So, right now, I am focusing my attention on the younger ones, where you can't, it doesn't make sense to say you shouldn’t do it for the younger ones. 

00:59:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Uh, sitting and visiting with you is a very warm uh, experience and uh, I was just sitting here and being aware of the fact that uh, I can better understand now, why children are so comfortable in your presence. And, why being touched by you would be uh, very much a an inter person kind of touching experience. I am feeling that with you here now, and I want to thank you so much for um, being here and this has been a delightful opportunity for me to visit with you. Thank you for coming and uh, being here. 

01:00:10
DR. VIOLA BRODY Thanks I enjoyed doing it with you too. 

01:00:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Thank you very much. 

01:00:15
DR. VIOLA BRODY Thank you for asking me. 

01:00:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I, I want to touch you. 

01:00:15
