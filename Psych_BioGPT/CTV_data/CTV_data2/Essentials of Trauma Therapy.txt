BETTY ALICE ERICKSON God afternoon and welcome to Point Counter Point four, Essentials of Trauma Therapy. I'm Betty Alice Erickson and the presenter is Dr. France-- Francine Shapiro and the discussant is David Barlow. Dr. Shapiro, ah, Dr. Shapiro is literally the inventor of the treatment of EMDR. She did an enormous amount of research showing its efficacy to such organizations as the Department of Defense and the American Psychiatric Association. She has received numerous awards and honors including the Sigmund Freud Award for Psychotherapy from the Vienna, from the city of Vienna, Austria and the distinguished scientia-- scientific achievement award for outstanding contribution to the practice intr-- or in treatment of trauma form the California Psychological Association. She is an author of multiple books. Her latest on is written for lay as well as lay people as well as clinicians and the first half of the title which I love is getting past your past. Dr. Barlow, Dr. David Barlow who will be the discussant for this is equally as distinguished. He is, he is the-- he looked up at me as well. I smiled. He is the founder and the Ameritas director of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University. He has an extraordinary-- he has an extraordinarily prolific writer. I'm just blown away by this. Over 500 articles and contributions including chapters to over 60 books. He's won numerous awards as well including the James McKeen Fellow award for lifetime achievement in psychological research. So, the format of the program is Dr. Shapiro will speak for an hour. Dr. Barlow will have 15 minutes and then we welcome questions. Please use the microphone and speak a little slowly and very clearly and recognize that when we're standing up here we can't see people standing at the microphones. So wave your arms, somehow get our attention okay. Thank you. And with that, Dr. Shapiro.

FRANCINE SHAPIRO Thank you very much. Can you hear me? No, that's not gonna work. Can we put on the mic? Does it work now? Oh, good. All right. All right, so essentials of Trauma Treatment, part of my message here is that, uhm, the elimination of suffering an symptoms is only one part of it. When we're dealing with PTSD, you know we have different symptom clusters that we look at. That's just one piece of what I'd like us to do as profession-- is to look beyond the simple cyst, ah,-- symptoms and take a look at who the individual becomes. What else do we need to do to make sure we have a healthy adult or a child with, including the ability to self soothe and feel the full range of emotion. Have a good sense of self and awareness and even more than that, be an integral member of a larger society. Interact and bond properly, be resilient, have a positive outlook, cope adaptively, be able to set boundaries, contribute, emphasi-- ah, emphasize. So we're looking at the clinical picture in terms of what needs to be addressed. Not just, gee, can we get right of the flashbacks and get rid of the nightmares cuz that's, that's just a really small part of it. Just to give you a bit of background in terms of EMDR therapy and its empirical status. It's considered an A level treatment for trauma, recommended by organizations like the department of defense and the world health organization. There's a list of ref-- research references on, ah, on the website so you can see the references for these different things I'm talking about. The randomized control trials, and there are about 24 across trauma populations have indicated that 84-100% of single trauma victims no longer have PTSD after the equivalent of three 90 minute sessions. And, uhm, set-- combat trauma, we're looking at 80, ah, 78% after 12 sessions. This is just the research itself. And clearly, more pervasive trauma throughout childhood is going to need more sessions so what we're looking at is we're not going for our rates but we do wanna look out what is efficient. And for instance, when you're dealing with a single trauma, ah, and you have that rule of thumb of-- actually its one to three sessions. You can see changes within single sessions, uhm, and I'm gonna show you some treatment tapes so you can take a look at that. If we look at the world health organization these are their new practice guidelines. Then there, uhm, and again, the references on that sheet. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and EMDR are the only psychotherapies that are recommended for the treatment of PTSD in children, adolescents and adults. No pharmaceuticals are recommended. So the amount of people that you know that have gone to physicians and then given medication for their PTSD keep in mind the world health organization does not support that. Rather, we would be looking at how can we treat them through appropriate psychotherapy. Now, you have CBT. Trauma-focused CBT is validated. EMDR therapy is validated but there are differences between the two treatments as per the, ah, WHO guidelines. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve a detailed descriptions of the event, direct challenging beliefs, extended exposure, or homework. So, what we would need to be looking is if you have two forms of therapy which are validated treatment of the same disorder but are so different, what might be potential differences in underlying neurobiological mechanisms and I'll talk a little bit of that as well. Uhm, because basically what we're looking about-- at is any form of psychotherapy is guided by a particular conceptualization that's going guide how you view the client and the procedures that you use. So Psychodynamic Therapy-- how many have primary orientation of psychodynamic? Okay. Let's say the foundation of the pathology is just believed to be the intrapsychic conflicts and the treatment involves transference and verbal working though okay. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. How many of you have that as a primary orientation? Okay. Ah, the foundation of the pathology, dysfunctional beliefs or behaviors and the treatment is the direct procedural manipulations of beliefs or behaviors. The challenging of beliefs workbook, etcetera. Uhm, behaviors might be with exposure therapy. For instance, prolonged exposure therapy where the client would be describing the memory in detail and be asked to hold it in mind, describing it as if they're reliving it. I feel, I feel the rapist's hands, I smelled the breath, etcetera. The idea is to prevent avoidance thing which is believed to be the reason that the PTSD would be maintained. For EMDR therapy-- believe-- we believe the foundation of the pathology are the unprocessed physiologically stored memories of these experiences. And therefore the treatment is the accessing and processing of these memories and also the current situations that trigger the negative responses and also templates for appropriate future functioning which I'll describe later on. But it's a three pronged protocol and all of it has to do with processing. The, uhm, Adaptive Information Processing is basically saying that it has to suppress it because we all have an information processing system that geared to make sense of the world. And if I had never seen a cup I wouldn't know what to do with it. But because I have, the image, the perceptions link into my memory networks and I make sense of it and I know how to function with it automatically. I don't have to think about it. It just happens. Now, these automatic responses. I mean, how you respond in the world. So, for instance, if I say a line-- I'm gonna say a sentence to you, just yell back the first thing that comes to mind, okay. Roses are red. Are they blue? No, they're actually purple but it came up automatically right? You couldn't prevent it, it was just there and when was the last time you heard that rhyme but that is automatically there. Now this is same thing with automatic responses in the world, they're there. So if we have an unprocessed memory, it's going to have a neg-- cause a negative affect to emerge because we're basically saying that except in the cases of genetic organic deficits stored unprocessed memories are the basis of this functional perception, response, attitude, self-cons-- ah, concept, personality creates symptoms. In other words, cross the DSM. We're looking at the unprocessed memory that are the basis of it because one of the other functions of the information processing system is to take disturbance to a level of resolution. So if I have a fight with someone at work, I have automatic physical-- everyone ever have a fight with someone at work, right. Negative self talk and the anger and the physical, you know. And then, you know, you walk away and you think about it, you dream about it which is very important. And you wake up the next morning and you maybe feel better about it. Anybody, anybody there ever had the experience of going to bed disturbed about something and waking up the next day feeling better? That's what happens with REM okay. But if the experience is too disturbing, it overwhelms that information processing system and the memory gets stored and in isolation. Not able to link up with anything more adapted. That learning, future learning is not able to take place. And these unprocessed memories contain the affect, the thoughts, sensations, behavioral responses encoded at the time of the event. So, flashbacks, nightmares, those positive symptoms of PTSD. This is the triggering of these unprocessed memories that are manifesting in those types of, uhm, you know, those types of symptoms and it's the processing of these etiological memories whether it's for PTSD or whatever other dysfunction we're looking at results in change in symptom but also in trait and personality change. Now, I think what we need to look at as I have mentioned previously, what is a redefinition of trauma. We all recognize the major criterion. A event that-- unnecessary to diagnose PTSD but researchers clearly indicated that general live events can cause even more PTSD symptoms and major trauma. And in a w-- and this is so important to understand because the amount of people that are going in to physicians and being medicated for anxiety responses, for depression, etcetera when what they really have is the post traumatic symptoms but they've never been raped, they've never been to war so they positioned us, recognized that as an issue. The fact that we can look at a whole bunch of research. I'm going to go more of it in the, uhm, presentation I'm doing tomorrow. That there's a whole slew of research that indicating that these general life experiences are-- make a major contribution to dysfunction and if we are able to communicate that to our clients, it's a relief for them as well because most everyone can feel compassion if the know someone has been raped, right? If they know someone has been molested. Most people can feel tremendous compassion for combat veterans because of what they've gone through. But most people cannot have compassion for themselves with their symptoms because they just feel, oh, there's something wrong with me, I'm just damaged. No, what they need to know is they have the same physiological issue as any of those who have been raped, molested in combat. It's a physiological problem and that this experience is physiologically stored and processed in their brain and can continue to be sparked and come out automatically and the feelings that they have of guilt, shame, I'm not good enough and not lovable is no different than violets are blue. That's not true and the way they're feeling isn't true either. So this notion that they are suffering from a physiological issue also can take away the stigma from mental health, ah, mental health therapy in being able to recognize that if I broke my leg I'd have no difficulty going to a physician to have it aligned and with a cast to allow to heal. So I should have no stigma in going to a mental health professional to stimulate my stalled information processing and allow that digestion of that unprocessed memory to take place. Other examples, a substantial data that work has established that environmental adversity can have a deleterious effect on child functioning including socioemotional behavior problems and cognitive deficits. I mean, it really runs across the board. So if we're looking at examples adverse life experiences besides the criterion A trauma, marital conflict, flight fights that mom and dad were having, negative or anger expressiveness to the child, maternal depression, harsh, restrictive parenting or school-peer humiliations and failures, bullying. All of these things can have such a negative effect again because the disturbance at the time was so high it overwhelms the information processing system and that those memories get stored in that way and continue running that show. So the EMDR therapy is an eight phase treatment. We identify the targets for processing which include the past events that at the groundwork for whatever problem it is we're addressing. The present triggers. That means the current situations that trigger the disturbance, that trigger these memories and any future needed behaviors which is going to be different depending upon how pervasive the negative experiences were. If you have a rape for instance and that's the only really adverse life experience. The individual has already has a well developed sense of self, etcetera. The future template might be simply making sure imaginarily that they can go to the same areas, dark alleys, let's say if they want to, ah, where they might have been raped so that would be a future template that would be-- you would use. For someone with pervasive developmental trauma, you'd be looking at incorporating these skills that are needed for rela-- appropriate relationships, etcetera. So you're identifying what is, what is needed depending upon the complexity if the case and that's gonna determine how many memories need to be processed and how many templates are need-- gonna be incorporated. Uhm, the reprocessing phases, the desensitization installution-- installation body progresses after we have identified through an assessment-- I'm sorry, the preparation, ah, is going to be techniques for affect control in processing. That is to make sure that the client can stay feeling fully in control and safe while processing takes place because during that time, you're going to be accessing the memory and there's gonna be a certain amount of disturbance that arises and so we want the client to make sure that they have a technique that if they need to stop. They hold up their hand, they use the technique, feel better and then move on. You wouldn't do that for instance in prolonged exposure because the, uhm, the view is that avoidance in doing things to get away from it is why the PTSD remains. So you wouldn't want to encourage stopping during processing. EMDR therapy, it's, it's different. It's a different form and I'll show you that with some treatment tax. So we access-- we assess the memory for targeting. Ah, what, ah, what the most disturbing image, the negative belief they have currently, ah, positive belief they prefer to have if they hold the negative image and the negative belief, what emotion arises and, ah, what are the physical sensations they're feeling and then there are measures to, to see how strong the positive belief is and how high the negative disturbances. So, desensitization installation and body scan continue processing with emphasis on the first part, the elish-- elicitation that inside the elimination and change from negative into positive ones because as new associations are made positive information, ah, becomes incorporated, strengthening the positive belief and also evaluating how's my bod-- how's the body feel? Okay, so, ah, an example is your bringing up a negative belief in negative imagery and you might feel anxiety, you might feel guilt, you'd be feeling it at different parts of your body. So bringing together the image, the negative belief and where you're feeling and in your body, then begin with bilateral stimulation which can be either eye movements or taps or tones and there is a meta analysis that has shown the positive effects of the eye movement is about 24 studies that are showing that. Then after processing is complete for that session, you use the self control techniques again that you taught during preparation to make sure the client feels good. Ah, sense of equilibrium, has the tools in case disturbance comes up midsession, identify what might need to be target and then the next session you will re-evaluate by bringing back, see if there's anything more to be processed and overall there are standardized procedures for each of these different phases. So the client history phase again if it's not purely organic. We're based on lack of information. We're looking at one of the targets that have sent the groundwork for the pathology and we trace the present reactions to the past experiences on a heav-- go into more of that in detail than my presentation tomorrow. What present experiences cause the disturbance and what targets will fill the deficit and in order to have processing take place cuz again, processing is the notion but you have an isolated, unprocessed memory network. It's stored so-- and it has not been able to link up with anything more adaptive. Processing means you're stimulating the inherent information processing system and so it begins to make the associations to adaptive networks but if they don't exist, in your client the processing will not take place. Part of your evaluation is, does that client have positive experiences? Most people do. Times where they occasionally felt good about themselves. Relationships that they've had that had been somewhat supportive, etcetera. But when those don't exist you have to encode them and that's where you would be using your relationship, therapeutic relationship to be incorporating positive experiences so they can feel the positive regard, etcetera and their different procedures to allow you to link in those memories and make them more accessible. So here's an example of a study that was done by Bessel van der Kolk and this was a comparison of EMDR therapy with Prozac and you can see there's a difference here. I-- the child onset had after eight session, those eight sessions of, ah, EMDR therapy compared to eight weeks of Prozac then both treatments was stopped and then checked. Ah 88 for a child onset PTSD, 88.9, ah, percent had PTSD we measure. For adult onset, it was 91.7% PTSD remission. But look in the-- look at the difference and of course, better than Prozac but look at the difference in a symptomatic. The difference between 30% at follow up and 80 be-- 80% at follow up depending upon onset. And that's what again we would be looking at as how much treatment is needed when you have child onset and there are more memories to be processed. You would expand beyond eight sessions clearly, ah, in order to complete. But we-- so we don't only wanna look at the PTSD remission because they're comfortable but rather how were they and in the rest of their life what is the full clinical picture look like? And now it's a part of the essentials of trauma treatment again as don't get fixed aid and just the positive symptoms of PTSD but whether they look like fully in their lives. So, uhm, as new experiences are stored in memory, the dysfunctional network expands and reinforces the positive vic-- the negative experiences. So from childhood, if that's when you started with, you're gonna have larger networks in order to process cause each negative experience also becomes encoded and needs to be dealt with. So earlier experiences, increased vulnerability to anxiety disorders, depression, other diagnoses, even overt symptoms of PTSD from depression, ah, identified critical incident can be fed by earlier ones. So, for instance the tape that I showed earlier today of an earthquake victim clear criterion of a event, clear symptoms of PTSD but what happens is that when you target that memory, the brain begins to make the appropriate associations and what came up were earlier childhood experiences that we're feeding it. Where he felt her sense of reality being rocked as a child. And so earlier experiences are being molested which he had not made her symptomatic for PTSD until this second earthquake had occurred. Since her-- and she-- what she realized during the processing was it jarred her, it jarred her sense of reality that her brother she adored molested her and look how that linked in to an earthquake where the earth is literally being shaken. Also, other experiences of her mother and father fighting and her cowering under the covers when she was a child very similar to the major negative image he had as in, in the earthquake where she was cowering in the doorway trying to protect her son So the thing is, don't again, get caught up in only the major trauma. Be willing to look underneath and see what else may be there. So it's important to evaluate the entire clinical picture to assess vulnerability and including clinical and relational difficulties. So, ah, processing being the forging of new connections between that dysfunctional network and a positive one in order for processing to take place the client needs to know they can do it without fear and just let whatever happens happen. Prices of experience must exist. They must be able to stay present and client history doesn't dictate whether positive networks exist cuz even those with pervasive developmental trauma could have had one, even one significant other in their childhood who protected them, who gave them a good sense of self and that what you can use in order to allow the processing to take place. As far as the hypotheses that had been supported by research. Ah, again they were there were, ah, 20 randomized control trials showing positive effects of the eye movement. One is that the eye movement tax working memory so for instance, phone numbers, seven numbers cuz that all we can kinda hold in mind. So with the theory being that if you bring up this trauma and then you add in the bilateral st-- bilateral stimulation. It over taxes the ability of your working memory to hold it and it begins to degrade the imagery and lowers the arousal. Okay, and there's research support for that. Then there's research support for that, the bilateral stimulation appears to stimulate, ah, affect similar to that which occur in rapid eye movement sleep when sleep dependent processing of episodic memory so that episodic memory-- what happens to you in a moment is, is stored in memory has the negative emotions, physical sensations, etcetera during REM sleep, that memory is able to link with all of your other associated memories and therefore those connections are able to get made and it gets integrated and ends appropriately stored. The research indicates, ah, that the beginning of the eye movement, just inaugurating you see an, an, an activation of the parasympathetic symptom-- system and that there's an automatic relaxation response that emerges. So this also assist trauma victims to make it easier for them to process their own. And, uhm, again and that med analysis which you'll see on that research list has shown that in both clinical and analog trials, ah, the eye movement have pronounced effects. So going back to the notion of adverse life experiences, this is an extremely important study that was done actually in 98. Found a strong dose response relationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and muh-- multiple risk factors for several, ah, of the leading causes of death in adult and conditions that have been shown to be-- that, that, that those relationship include alcoholism, drug abuse, severe obesity, depression, suicide attempts, heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, skeletal fractures and liver disease. So these adverse life experiences from childhood, the tough life that some people had. The more of those experiences they had, the greater the change of them having these conditions as adults. That means we need to look at not only treatment but prevention of these disorders. The sooner we're able to treat these children who have had these experience, the less possibility they have of having these major difficult adult conditions. So, for pervasive developmental issues, use that three pronged protocol; past, present and future. And you process memories relative to personal and relational difficulties evaluating the entire clinical picture and that means that processing of memories can change because they're associated, changes on multiple domains and I'm gonna show you a tape that illustrates that. And processing results and generalization of facts meaning you do not have to process every negative memory this individual has had because it is stored, stored associationally. What we do is we look for a cluster of events, times of humiliation you need to process one and you can generalize to associate it once in the cluster. Molestation by brother, chose one. It can, ah, generalize to the associated memories. Now a brother brought in his friends to help, help him out. You're gonna have to process that separately probably because it's different enough but you don't-- again, you don't have to process each and every memory you're identifying, uhm, the clusters and one from each of the different clusters. So here an illustration of a treatment and the generalization of facts in the treatment of an adult child, and alcoholic parent who experience parental neglect, abuse, molestation and was also presenting with a dental phobia, okay. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
 Okay, so you've had two weeks. 

00:33:50
 Uhm, since the last target. 

00:33:55
 Yes. 

00:33:55
 Do you remember what we target? 

00:34:00
 Uhm, we targeted my, uhm, molestation experience. 

00:34:10
 And without any particular experience in mind when you think about that issue? Just as it appeared to you and any wish you would say. 

00:34:25
 You know, I'm okay with it. I'm even okay with my mom in the whole situation of it whereas before I was so angry with her at her lack of being responsible and a bit alone. Uhm, she made a mistake, she wasn't there. I understand that she was a bad mom. 

00:34:45
 Yeah. 

00:34:50
 That's what it would sound to you and I can't change the past. 

00:34:50
 Mm-hmm. 

00:34:50
 And I just think of myself being there for that young child. 

00:35:00
 Now. 

00:35:00
 Now. 

00:35:00
 Yeah. 

00:35:05
Generalization Effects When client was being re-evaluated from previous sessions, multiple generalization effects were reported on other targets we had planned to address "The Birth Session" An earlier session had focused on client feeling responsible and guilty for mother's post-birth trauma..... Client's foot had been "caught" on mother's ribs making it impossible for her to emerge NC: "it's my fault, I'm bad" PC: "I am worthy" 

00:35:10
[sil.] 

00:35:20
 Sometimes where we-- are we on materials and targeted and cleared. Some of the later thing may be not be there, ah, to spend a little, a little disturbance, sometimes it just-- it was disturbingly-- did before you did there earlier to turn up. So just checking out where you are in this list of targets would be happy. Uhm, the issue, all right, surrounding your birth. 

00:35:45
 Mm-hmm. 

00:35:45
 Does that, just how does that feel to you? 

00:35:50
 It was fine. 

00:35:50
 Okay. Clear? 

00:35:50
 One hundred percent clear. 

00:35:55
 Okay. 

00:36:00
Medical and dental neglect At age 5, she had accumulated cavities. When she was finally talk for dental work, no anesthesia was used.... The dentist didn't think she needed any because the cavities were so "small".... Dental phobia ever since... This target also ended up resolved through previous sessions, though not targeted directly... 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:10
 Does that have a church on the pedestal? 

00:36:15
 You know what? I don't think so. Uhm, I actually just went to the dentist again and since I've had the EMDR, going to the dentist is so much easier. I mean, significantly easier. 

00:36:35
 What you have done that by then since we started? 

00:36:35
 Uhm, I just had one, uhm, last week and I had to get a crown. 

00:36:40
 Holy cow! 

00:36:45
 Yeah. 

00:36:45
 Well, when did you notice what you were doing in this thing cuz it's obviously a ches... 

00:36:50
 Trigger. 

00:36:50
 A potential trigger point. 

00:36:50
 You know, I think, I think it had to do with knowing that I could keep myself safe, that I was worth keeping myself safe and when I had met this-- the-- this guy I felt... 

00:37:05
 Like you want to. 

00:37:05
 Exactly. 

00:37:05
 Yeah, I remember. That was great. So I think with, ah, changes in me, ah, I can allow my, uhm, me to protect myself as well as other people to protect myself, that I am worth it. That is just-- it was fine. I had my i-pod and and I actually even turned it off and just sat with it, sitting in the chair by myself doing nothing, no i-pod. 

00:37:35
 Wow. 

00:37:35
 That's amazing considering the earlier events which we had, not even talking. 

00:37:45
 Yeah. 

00:37:50
Phase 3 Assessment of new target 

00:37:50
 Then, ah, I would say, ah, from this list, the next place you went was becoming the ages of 10 and 16 where your mom became an alcoholic. 

00:38:00
 Mm-hmm. 

00:38:00
 She just started drinking everyday, you know, morning to night. And you told me about a time where you actually remember trying to break your own ankles. 

00:38:10
 Yeah. 

00:38:10
 Okay. 

00:38:15
Target Description She had a plan to climb to the top of her bunk bed, stick her ankles into the frame & throw herself over, thereby breaking her ankles. Then show wouldn't have to take care of everyone & everything..... 

00:38:20
 And I believe that you told me you had a-- about that, wasn't trapped. 

00:38:25
 Mm-hmm. 

00:38:30
 So (inaudible ) I have two choices here. 

00:38:32
 Right. 

00:38:35
 This is it. How did this strike you too? 

00:38:35
 I just get this clenching in my gut. 

00:38:40
 Okay. 

00:38:40
 It was the first. 

00:38:45
 So you have a picture of this in your mind. 

00:38:45
 Yes. 

00:38:45
 Think of all the image that comes to you about this. This is saying that you believe filtering. 

00:38:55
 Yes. 

00:38:55
 Okay, you try. And you would prefer to believe filtering. 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:10
 Ah, I mean I like to just say I have options but I don't know if that. When you think about this, "Can they hear me now". 

00:39:25
 And disguise the memory. How true does it guarantee that you have options? 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
 I mean, I wish I had option. I mean I definitely did not have options then. 

00:39:45
 No. 

00:39:50
Choices One of this client's issues is that she "cannot speak up for herself" and therefore feels trapped in her present situations, unable to make adult choices on her behalf 

00:39:55
 Anna(ph), I've got level while you're holding this particular rumor in your life. How true does not enough options feel? It certainly feels totally true or you got level? And how one feels about their faults. 

00:40:05
 What? 

00:40:10
 What emotions you noticed? 

00:40:10
 Being upset and strong. Crying, like I could cry at any second. And sadness too. 

00:40:20
 (inaudible ) to you. How certain do you think that was his. It's you're tummy saying you're... 

00:40:35
 Uhm, I would say that this is a seven. 

00:40:40
 What are you gonna say-- upset your mommy. 

00:40:40
 Right here. 

00:40:40
Phase 4 Reprocessing 

00:40:45
 If you hold this package together and that's your ability would lie. You just heard the word. 

00:40:55
[sil.] 

00:41:05
 Gonna need some... That isn't correct. 

00:41:10
 I had, uhm,-- call the cops one day and this crying and explained everything to them what was going on and I, I couldn't live there anymore. That something needed to be done. And, the cop on the other end said, "Even though, she's hoping I can too." 

00:41:35
 Did you read her poem? 

00:41:35
 Yeah. 

00:41:35
 There's nothing I could do. 

00:41:40
 Now, this one is... all right. 

00:41:45
 I, uhm, was in the back yard cleaning and I remember thinking to myself I should commit suicide. There's no way out. Like, I can't, I can't handle this anymore, there's nothing I can do and there's no way out. Remember thinking I can't do that because I don't, don't, don't wanna take care of these children. 

00:42:20
 Look. 

00:42:25
 I'm, I'm just seeing myself getting walked all over, never standing up for myself even to present day situations, especially in in work or any type of authority, any type of authority think you're, you're just not expressing yourself in my opinion or what I feel like I should or deserve. Not even want. I don't feel like I can ever express myself. I feel like it's what I want to try to break my ankles. 

00:43:00
 Right where we started. 

00:43:00
 Right where we started. That was the combination of me not feeling like I had a voice. 

00:43:10
 Okay. 

00:43:15
 I, uhm, I did have some choices. I ran track and played basketball, uhm, starting in fifth grade. And I loved sports. I mean, that was my outlet and that was my voice. I'm 16, I'm a sophomore in high school and the doctors told me that I can't play sports anymore because of my knees. 

00:44:00
 Great. 

00:44:05
 And that's like, everything was taken away. 

00:44:10
 Thank you miss (inaudible ) appropriate ATM. 

00:44:15
 Okay, I'll see you, right. 

00:44:20
 Yeah. 

00:44:20
 It's all right? 

00:44:25
 Yeah. So much anger toward my parents that they won a ticket or game or be--- allow me to take care of me by them listening to what I'm saying. Telling them I'm pain and I need help. 

00:44:50
 What did you notice Anna(ph)? Are you sure? 

00:44:50
 I'm feeling it in my knees right now. 

00:44:55
 Okay, just continue to look. 

00:45:00
[sil.] 

00:45:05
 I was so blue when I had this image of-- this time I was, uhm, a freshman in high school. I'm in basketball, at a game on a Friday night and I got a concussion and my mom had to come and pick me up. I have this concussion, I on biking and for the whole weekend and for the whole next week I'm out. And that weekend my dad had planned out in redoing the kitchen floor. Well, because I wasn't there my mom had to do it and she was very angry. And to this day, she still talks about me getting a concussion like I had done enough of it so I won't have to be the forced. 

00:46:10
 You laughed now. 

00:46:10
 Yeah. Now it's, it's funny. I mean I don't know how I got there but it just backed into me and it's like-- it's ridiculous. 

00:46:25
 Bring it on. 

00:46:25
 A 15-year-old girl redoing a tile floor and she has a concussion and, and mom is angry at her. 

00:46:35
Adaptive adult perspective begins to emerge 

00:46:35
 Just so you get this overall sense of, ah, support and knowing that-- Even though I made out a pact, so many choices within my home. Outside of my home I did have choices and, you know, at school, in, ah, at work that I did have a voice. I'm just sitting on the bed with her. It's funny how everything was gonna be okay and it's okay for her to feel all the feelings I should get as, the feeling trapped, the feeling sad and frustrated and lonely and all of that. 

00:47:30
 It's the life she's living, she live. Its... 

00:47:35
 But... 

00:47:35

FRANCINE SHAPIRO Going to move on just for time's sake but you can see that the adult perspective isn't linked in and what was previously very disturbing is now with the processing knot because that childhood event had linked in, had-- was holding the negative emotion, physical sensations and beliefs as processing is taking place in the appropriate linkages it's not moving to the adult perspective. And it's with that then that it becomes stored when its appropriately fully processed, it becomes stored in an adaptive form. Now it becomes the basis of resilience. Look what I went through and I'm a strong person. It's a different sense of self and when we're looking-- because of time I'm gonna move through quickly now. Uhm, the difference between EMDR therapy and traditional exposure therapies is also potentially the difference in underlying biological mechanism and that research has indicated that extinction like the prolonged exposure description we are concentrating on for extended time, actually causes extinction and that means that the original memory is not changed, it creates a new one. The original memory that says if I stay with this anxiety for a long period of time I'm gonna go crazy, I'm gonna die. If the client is forced to stay attentive to it, it creates a new memory within the therapeutic environment that says I won't die from it and that's what becomes dominant but that old one is still there. What the research indicates that these expen-- extended exposures would be causing extinction. The research indicates that shorter exposures as you saw here in EMDR would be causing recondu-- reconsolidation. The original memory is accessed. It becomes changeable. Those new linkages take place. And now, that original memory is changed and stored in an altered form. So there's potentially difference in treatment outcome for instance. This is a study comparing EMDR therapy to an exposure therapy for complicated grief. Ah, and so when someone is-- had a loved one die very suddenly and the grief is not resolving. What often goes along with is are negative pictures, images of the person dying and suffering. Images of what the client should have done or could have done and didn't do so the guilt that goes along with it goes with these neg-- these negative images. The processing with EMDR as compared to exposure resulted in double the amount of positive recall of the deceased event after the memory is processed possibly because extinction would have left the old grief memory negative memory there still running interference but if it's reconsolidation for the EMDR therapy that's not. So this is important information for people who have lost a loved one whether family member or, or combat veteran who feel that they have to hold on to their pain because they're afraid they're gonna forget the loved one. And what you basically get to say is you don't forget the person. You can remember him even more but in a positive way so it reinforces that connection. The, ah, N, ah, MDR, ah, application to chronic pain. Again, that the, the traumatic experience in which the limb was damaged is also holding in the unprocessed memory, the physical sensations that were there at the time. So if the, ah, pain that the person is experiencing in, in a phantom limb pain, if it's actual cause by nerve damage, EMDR is not going to be able to affect that. But if it is indeed the unprocessed memory of the trauma, it is going to be able to affect it and indeed that's what we see. For instance here, the treatment of a combat veteran who had PTSD and you can see over on the two sessions, post two sessions and then three week follow up the impacted events scale declines. The, ah, back depression inventory declines but also importantly, the phantom limb pain declines. So the original experience he had in feeling the phantom limb was a sawing pain, a shooting pain radiation, a, ah, radiating pain aching and tingling. All of those disappeared except for some of the tingling which might actually be neuropathy and the five different studies that have been published, ah, indicating an aggregate of about 80% of either complete elimination or substantial reduction of pain. We love to see randomized control trials on this because it is also not just phantom limb pain but variety of, of unexplained medical symptoms that clients can have after a traumatic event may simply be the unprocessed memory holding those physical sensations and wanted to process the symptom the pain is able to remain. Examples now moving to relational issues. People reacting in different ways but really what's driving it? We would say it is the unprocessed memory underlying it. The book the, ah, ah, handbook of EMDR and family therapy processes. How many of you are family therapy people? Various different orientations may be looking at the interactional issues and what skills need to be incorporated but you have to teach in order to change the interaction but very often you can reach a therapeutic impact because as beautifully as you teaching it, they're not learning it. Because of the amount of anger, let's say, they have. The, the outburst, the clinginess because you have the unprocessed drivers the unprocessed memories that are pushing the negative affect that don't allow them to assert themselves or causing them to be aggressive. So if you use the EMDR processing of these earlier memories and allow those to be drained, then when you teach the skill they can actually learn it and you can do your full evaluation. So educate the client, process the past events, the current situations that set them off. Often the look on her is the same one he got from his mother. The sound of his voice is the sound that she got from her father. Often these things are pushing it and and pressing it actually liberates them. Ah, so again, we're looking at past, present and future. Also, ah, which would love to get across is that nobody needs to be left behind. There's the, the impact of stored memories and what we found is with a subset of molesters, child molesters that had themselves been molested as children. Once that memory of their own molestation is processed, the denial goes away, the empathy for the victim. They take responsibility for what they're doing and here's and example of the, ah, penile plethysmograph graph which actually measures penis-- uhm, deviant arousal and you can see the decline in deviant arousal. They no longer saw the children as sexual objects. What they did was they saw that people because in the processing of their own memory of molestation. They got in touch with how they had actually felt and they were no longer in denial. How many victims, molestation victims believed they caused it. Well, that's what they were holding too. So they were not blaming the perpetrator for it. Therefore, they weren't blamed either. They must have wanted it. Their victim must have wanted it. Once the processing occurs, all of that is able to turn around. Ah, had another tape but, ah, ran out of time and show that tomorrow. Ah, but here's an example, would happen after processing in terms of be attached, the attachment scores moving into addictions and compulsions. Vi-- lot of literature talks about that linkage between trauma and addiction. That desire to self medicate and whatever the drug of choice might be or action whether it's sex or gambling, etcetera. By processing the earlier memories that are causing the pain, that are causing the lack of self esteem. So when they get a gambling win that high. Keeps them going after and wanting for more. There are specific EMDR protocols that, that we use in order to process that. And again, it's extremely important to look at the adverse life experiences that are pushing the addiction as you can see here. Shame he experiences of all types in childhood were part of the ideological event pushing the addiction as well as death of parents childhood, etcetera. So here's an example of data from a drug court up in Washington state graduation from drug court is considered, ah, the highest indicator of recidivism. Uhm, graduation means that they're not going to, to be back and, uhm, there is-- here you can see the treatment is usual graduation rate was, ah, 5.5 to the addition of, ah, seeking safety which is a preparation for the we-- they use for doing the MDR processing, 62%. And then with the addition of EMDR therapy, 91%. Again going in and processing those earlier memories. So to put a face on it, the drugs of choice were alcohol, marijuana, meth, coke, ah, heroine, opiates. Here's the difference in terms of pre and post. So we're really talking about changing the life experience because they're no longer being pushed into it. And the personality disorder is that we sometimes as immutable. We're just saying these individual characteristics that an individual has, whether it be BPD or any other of the, of the, uhm, disorders is really based each characteristic on the unprocessed memory that's pushing back particular type of behavior. It's those affects that are causing these types of negative responses. Proceg them-- processing them allows them to shift inst-- in light of neu-- ah, in this neurophysiological research that complements and the PTSD study. So here you see the difference between pre/post EMDR Treatment. This was Amen's group. Ah, the change in limbic anterior cingulate, basal ganglia all calmed, post treatment. The important thing is this was not, ah, uhm, these were of, uhm, policeman that had encountered a line of duty, death were involved in the line of duty death, so is PTSD but this wasn't one of-- this high activation wasn't when they were thinking of the event. This is when they were simply concentrating on a different task meaning that's that brain, highly activated to respond negatively to the world in so many different ways cuz it's already primed to do it and the processing bring-- can bring back normal function. Same here in terms of, uhm, hypocampus clear, ah, shrinkage of hypocampus in PTSD and with EMDR you can see 12 sessions, ah, 6% increase in hypocampal growth. Meaning, huh, we don't have to assume people have to be left behind simply because there is a negative neurobiological concomitant. There is neuroplasticity. We would say that the continual feeding of the reactivity from these negative experiences are keeping the negative, ah, neurophysiological, ah, indicators there but once processed, then it's able to regenerate and grow. Important research also, maternal PTSD and depression is associated with child maltreatment and frequency of child exposures to traumatic events. Meaning people who are hurting can hurt other people and so what we would love to see is sufficient amount of treatment for those who are experiencing these negative events as soon as possible in order to prevent the intergenerational transfer of pro-- of these problems. Now, think of it if moms who have PTSD are more likely to cause traumatic events for their children and maltreat them. Think of the numbers of women and men out there suffering all these clima-- if its climate change as they say. All of these major events, hurricanes, that have been going on. All of these weather associated that in the Philippines, how many people were devastated there with PTSD? Uhm, the earthquakes, the natural and the man-made disasters in wars, etcetera. How many adults have PTSD because of these major trauma and then transmit the trauma to their children. So what we're trying to do is get as much pro bono treatment out there as possible. Here's an example because you do not need to do homework with EMDR therapy. You can use extended sessions or consecutive day sessions. And so here's an example of one session after an earthquake in, ah, Mexico even though it would end with a 12 week follow up, even though there were continued aftershocks. So you can see the possible effect of one session. So, uhm, the ability then to have teams of mental health workers go out there and treat even in field work even in the most remote areas. We're looking at the completion of therapy in days, not even weeks and not even months because again, the research-- they randomize control trials, single event trauma is generally handled within three sessions. Here you can do it in extended sessions or consecutive day sessions. And here's an example. There's also a group therapy protocol and this is one that, ah, was inaugurated by use of something they called the butterfly hug where the individual is doing bilateral stimulation as they are with artwork allowing it to be done in a group. So these were women who had been raped in the Congo reporting with PTSD symptoms. The first image is the house in which they were raped. I mean, sorry. This is the safe place cuz part of the preparation incorporating positive feelings. Their house gave them a positive feeling. Ah, palm oil tree, ah, very nice house. This gave 'em positive feelings that gives them the ability to go back with an imagery to a positive, ah, experience. Doing that bilateral stimulation in groups as their drawing first, ah, the house for the safe place. Then the fear that they had during the combat experience in which they were raped. Third picture, how we fled and others dead. Again, with each set, what comes up, new picture and in the fourth picture, it's amazingly, ah, even for me generally resolved. Here you have the refugees coming back, ah, to new construction. The reports of these women, ah, after the two sessions, group sessions not only where the PTSD symptoms gone but the back, the spontaneously told the researcher, the clinician that back aches that they had since the rape had disappeared. Again, physical sensations stored from where they're held down. So what we are looking at is research that indicates that in order to imagine a po-- a future, it activates the same parts of the brain that are there when you think of something from the past. So if we want a positive future that allows a sense of emotional healing and forgiveness with self acceptance, etcetera, we would be looking at pro-- processing these earlier experiences that are preventing people from being able to connect. Whether it's on opposite sides of ethno-political divide or just within our own communities. And here is, ah, the humanitarian assistance program we have which offers pro bono treatment. Ah, for the trauma recovery programs and also low cost trainings for nonprofit agencies and that's my time. Thank you.

DAVID BARLOW So on the counterpoint of the point, counterpoint, ah, duo but I'll just limit my remarks to, uhm, a couple of comments that struck me as the, ah, uhm, hearing about all these very exciting, ah, the research and, and clinical work and, and one of 'em is that, uhm, there really is a lot of, ah, ah, coming together in concepts. It's not to say that the kinds of operations we're talking about our, uhm, entirely kinda isomorphic or that the rationales underlying them are the same but this, uhm,-- inevitably dealing with, ah, the human experience we're dealing with, ah, I think a developing kind of a consensus into some of the important things we have to deal with and I'll talk about maybe some of the points of divergence in a second. Uhm, first of all, we had, ah, going back into our history, you know, a period of kind of a classical psychoanalysis with a great deal of, ah, emphasis on unconscious processes if not most of the emphasis on that. And then there was a reaction in the 60's, ah, from behavior therapist, I think Rockman and the like who basically ran the other way from anything, ah, unconscious. Uhm, and there was very radical diversion set that point in time. Talked about conditioning processes and it is accounting for much of the emotional phenomenology and the like. Then in the 70s and 80s we have push, pushes from, ah, the laboratories of cognitive and behavioral science particularly cognitive science, uhm, CBT kind of, ah, inexorably, ah, rediscovered the unconscious. Only then we called it implicit knowledge in a more respectable scientific term I guess. But it really meant the same thing, it was knowledge of which people for one reason or another were unaware. If anything has become more powerful as we have delve back into emotional responding and looked at the nature of emotions and the various ways in which we process emotions I don't know. And the way out in science magazines this week, some of you may have seen the article looking at, ah, in terms of all your family therapist, ah, in the audience looking at couples, uhm, and assessing, first of all, their, uhm, actual, ah, conscious reaction to their new spouse which, ah, just as they were getting married which was of course uniform and extremely positive. Uhm, the bad news comes later right? You all know. But then, interestingly they assess their implicit evaluation of, ah, their new, ah, spouse using some of the traditional, ah, measures of implicit associations in, uhm, cognitive psychology these days. The very brief word associations almost below the level of awareness, 30 milliseconds and the like. And what they found was, ah, there was very little relation between the two. All right, so there was, uhm, you know, the positive implicit ones and there was a range of implicit-- positive explicit, a range of implicit, then they followed them every year for four years and what they found was the implicit evaluations predicted the outcome of the marriage at four years. And now, the explicit ones but these were being roundly denied by the people entering into the, ah, the marriage. So, ah, clearly these things are important and it's been all these years. I mean, as clinicians we say all these stuff is very important, uhm, and it is but, uhm, until we actually, through the hard work of research, nail down the actual relationships between what's going on in the brain and what going on in the memories, what are the characteristics of it and does it predict the future, most important of all. Then we're still just guessing quite frankly. And this is one of the first examples that's why I, ah, I'm bringing up tonight. One of the first examples we can really predict the future based on some of these implicit, ah, processes and interestingly they should be more of these, ah, to come. Ah, we're coming-- there, there's a, a general recognition and I think you'll see it on Dr, Shapiro's talk and if you heard me speak earlier about the importance of early adverse experiences and how it interacts with, ah, ah, and you kind of a ge-- genetic, ah, predisposition to create a temperament which we think we call neuroticism so we don't think these are just early precursors to trauma. We don't think it's just the broadened definition of trauma. We think it actually is the psychological diathesis through creating a temperament of neuroticism out of which all emotional disorders spring. We think there increasing, ah, evidence for that and I think much of that I think were in, in, ah, ah, pretty much, ah, agreed on that. Uhm, we certainly also agree on the, ah, importance of processing these, ah, uhm, we can call it memories or we can call them emotion or they disagree on that but, uhm, the, ah, processing and that's not a new idea. You just got to go back to catharsis in, in some sense. It's been around a long time. A lot of agreement that, ah, you know, you need to pluck out this Shakespeare pointed out, you know, pluck out the, these, ah, seeds of sorrow and, ah, uhm, you know, exonerate them from the brain and somehow deal with them. Get them on-- get them out on the open where you can deal with 'em. Uhm, maybe just to-- since it's my job to also, ah, draw out some differences there'd be a few areas of probably, ah, less than perfect, ah, divergence. Uhm, ah, first of all in the CBT I was glad to see Dr. Shapiro bring up the work on what we're learned about the process of extinction and how we can, ah, ah, really creating new memories and the various ways of doing that and the importance. You know, we even now know research from some of the neuroscientist, uhm, that there are when we can queue these emotions and these, ah, associations. There are periods at which we are able to affect reconsolidation. There are time periods and those periods are typically within, say, 30 minutes after we queue the memories. Thirty minutes to an hour and this is true in both rats and in people. And if you try to go back and queue the memories at one point and then go back a few hours later and attempt to, ah, you know, create, ah, new memories or do the extinction process. Let's say, the exposure and the extinction doesn't work. You don't create the new memories so we're learning very specifically about the temporal relations. This is all from basic research in the laboratory. Between when you begin to process these thing, when you begin to do your exposure therapy let's say or you're queuing these, these old memories and when you can affect the reconsolidation. Uhm, the way we do exposure these days, we stop all the time too so the prolonged exposure in terms of a really unbroken kind of recording, that used to be the way we do it. We no longer do that. We know that, uhm, in fact, the, uhm, it doesn't make much difference whether we even experience some anxiety or fear reduction in the session itself. As long as we do it during the window of reconsolidation and, ah, and are able to, ah, create some new memories, ah, in that regard. We are also increasingly-- in our clinic we routinely do treatment in, uhm, anywhere from a day to a week if patients are really interested in that. We find, for example, that our, ah, our adolescents who, if they're not out of school all together and, you know, in a hospital or someplace but they still are trying to re-- remain in all their activities. They're very busy here at school and after school activities. They often live in the suburbs, our clinics in the city. You know, slopping them in yet another place. You know, it's just absolutely creates discord in the family so we, we have the families actually come to us and say is there some way we can do this during summer vacation or during school vacation. And so we routinely now treat our adolescents with, ah, any variety of disorders in, intensive programs in a week's time. You know, just take a week schedule and then do it. Uhm, so there is that. We do use homework still to talk about another thing Dr. Shapiro brought up. We use that really to bring the treatment into the real world, ah, more than anything. We use that to bring, you know, by monitoring the emotions actually experiencing out in the real world. We find there's a lot of research showing that that contemporary is monitor as opposed to saying Oh how wa-- how was your week last week? You know, how much, ah, anxiety did you fell. How much fear did you fear. You're not gonna get the information that way. They, they're not gonna get half of it, they don't remember. But when you, you know, do have them actually monitor in real time, you know, we found over the year, you know, you get a lot more information and you get a lot more, ah, kind of a material to, ah, work with. And finally and probably the biggest point of the version and maybe we can discuss it in the last-- with the questions, when we have our question. Uhm, we, we don't, ah, went but we know, I'm talking about, ah, the way we will save you. The way we, ah, this-- forget the, ah, yeah. The way we, ah, now have isolated the five change principles that we think are applicable across the-- of emotional disorders. Uhm, the wa-- the, the way we, ah, introduce these. We don't feel it necessary to go back after the old memories so this would be a point of divergence I think between Dr. Shapiro and myself. We don't trace back to all the old memories. Do they come up. Yes, many times they come up. Of course they come up. We go after the emotions they're experiencing right now. We go after their intense emotional experience and we look to provoke that and work with that and create our reconsolidation around that. Does the same thing happen along the way? Maybe it does. That sort of remains to be seen. Is the result the same? It could be. Other mechanism that we both use, the appropriate ones to explain it, we don't know. In many ti-- many ways. We're just guessing about what's going happening inside the brain right now and the good guess is we don't know but time will tell. They th-- there are testable hypothesis I think. Uhm, the dental, ah, example for, you know, we, we wouldn't go after a dental memory unless they were a dental problem right now. A problem going to the dentist, ah, you know, right now. Then we would obviously take that and work with a new as an occasion to, ah, deal with the memories. So again, I, I could certainly, ah, go on. Ah, our goal, we totally agree. I think our goal ultimately is prevention. Our goal is to build in resilience. I think we're learning more about it. I think we're getting to-- there's a, there's a number of project just beginning, hard work to do, takes decades of course to see if it works, ah, these preventive studies but there's a number of projects underway that are attempting to do that. They look promising in terms of preventing anxiety and depression and, ah, we're in-- we're, uhm, initiating one ourselves. So I think that, uhm, the future is very interesting, the hard work of, uhm, actually confirming if all these processes, you know, just what role they play, just what the mechanisms of action are, is-- lies in front of us but in the mean time I think we can proceed forward as clinicians with an emerging consensus on at least the basic, ah, ways in which we go about, ah, relieving our, ah, the suffering of our patients in enhancing their, their functioning. Thank you. 

01:20:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And again, we have convergence and divergence and, ah, that's the purpose and we have time for one, maybe two questions. Does anyone have a question for either of our presenters? And then all I can say-- oh, is our question... 

01:20:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Ah, I just wanted to clarify something for Dr. Barlow. When the, the different-- we don't do in vivo exposure as part of the treatment when the person is feeling anxiety such as with the prolonged exposure protocol of going to a location and staying there until anxiety relents. But we do have prolonged exposure after the anxiety is gone. Uhm, basically, we'll go ahead and do it. Mostly they go ahead and do it on their own so we're able to get the feedback. We do want real world feedback. We just, as I said, don't ma-- it's not part of the treatment to get rid of the anxiety or, or dysfunction. 

01:21:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And we have a question. It's point counter point counter point. Yes ma'am. 

01:21:40
 Ah, question for Francine, uhm, in between EMDR sessions, uhm, when let's say, going to safe place or some other, uhm, methods of affect regulations aren't working when let's say new memories have come up and someone is very anxious and having a lot of, uhm, flashbacks. What are your recommendations for, uhm, dealing with that, ah, this regulation? 

01:22:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, re-recognizing that because you can do consecutive day treatment if you really have a hot memory that's something you can do. You can schedule morning and afternoon or a consecutive day and just clean out that memory within a very short period of time. So for the more difficult clients who are, are feeling too deregulated and of course, you've thought in the self control techniques during the preparation phase but if they're finding it's even more difficult for them, then you can simply do extended session and clean up the memory. 

01:22:50
 I have a quick question. Uhm, what would you-- I guess or y'all make of the, ah, treatment results that Dr. Shapiro, uhm, indicated, uhm, from the EMDR. 

01:23:00
DAVID BARLOW Was that for me? That question? 

01:23:05
 Yes. 

01:23:05
DAVID BARLOW What would I make of them? 

01:23:05
 Yes. What's your-- what, ah, what's your thought or your response to, uhm, kinda those statistics. 

01:23:10
DAVID BARLOW Oh, ah, they look very interesting. It's the first I've seen, many of those studies, uhm, ah, so, ah, yeah. I'd be very interested in, ah, now having learned about them. I'd be very interested to go back and, and look at them. If, uhm, I'm not sure quite what you're getting at unless you're trying to get us to need a, ah, said, I like them something. But, ah, the, the, ah, I mean, you know, the, the, the best way to answer that probably is the process of science. You know, how does science perceive? You know, how do we, ah, advance our knowledge and, ah, particularly in any field. Whether it's physics or, or our own field of psychotherapy where you start out with competing hypothesis, competing methods, competing, ah, ah, kinds of, ah, ideas. Sometimes there's-- you know, you think we fight. We, we're actually very civil. You should see the, the chemist and the physicist, you know. That their meetings knocked down and they drag out fights about their competing hypothesis and, you know, what's the origin of the sun and all that. But, uhm, science is a method. It's, it's a philosophy and a method of being able to go beyond that. To go beyond anecdote, to go beyond impressions and clinical work and actually establish, ah, what is true. And you'll get finding, ah, come out that seem to be competing and you have debates about them. And that's very important. Get familiar with them, you debate them and then I suggest maybe ways to clarify that. Then you do the next experiment. Uhm, and, uhm, you know, ultimately, you come to some kind of a, ah, consensus. I just, ah, you know, we'll say no more than the very contemptuous issue of, ah, of, uhm, you know, early memories of trauma and the malleability of memories. This was extraordinarily contentious. You know, my clinicians and scientists, and slowly we're coming into an understanding that yes, the process of memory is a very imperfect record of what happens. It's influenced by many, many different things. And, ah, you know, you can-- under certain circumstances create false memories that may not, ah, that may or may not be important clinically. If-- what may be important clinically is whether that memory is there or not and whether it needs to be, ah, dealt with. But, you know, science has proceed it along. Once all the, the weeping and noshing of teeth was kind of over five or eight years ago, the science continued. There's a lot more coming out. The major protagonist have kind of step aside and the new generation have come up and we're testing it. And this is the way our technology advances. And, ultimately, we have to have confidence. We're gonna be able to establish the truth and come to some greater understanding of what's happening. 

01:26:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And this is the last question. This we have to finish. 

01:26:20
 Okay. I was wondering if EMDR have been used in children who often-- or adolescents to often get traumatize at taking test. They're-- they have the knowledge, they studied, but when it comes to the actual taking of a test even us adults, we get to that test and they can't do it. Uhm, has EMDR been utilized to... 

01:26:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. That's a randomized control trial that shows positive effects with testing anxiety. And again, it's processing the earlier memories that cause that anxiety-- begin with. Yeah. And the research that I mentioned, you can find it on that research list that's part of the hand out that's on the, ah, evolution website and take a look. Okay, thank you. 

01:27:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And I thank you all for coming and I especially thank Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Barlow for an extremely interesting and thought provoking point counterpoint. Thank you.
