Culturally-Competent Counseling and Therapy Sponsored And Produced By The Society For The Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues Division 45 of the American Psychological Association With The Support Of Microtraining Associates Part IV: Innovative Approaches To Counseling Native-American Indian People Demonstrations by: Art Martinez Nora Martinez 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  Welcome. This is the fifth and final tape of our series on innovations in multi-cultural competence. I'm Allen Ivey of microtraining and I'd like to introduce Patricia Arredondo. Patricia is a professor at Arizona State University and president-elect of Division 45 of APA. Patricia? 

00:00:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Thank you, Allan. Ah, as Allan indicated, this film series focuses on innovative approaches to counseling from culturally-competent perspectives. Ah, this particular tape will focus on counseling from Native American, American-Indian traditional ways. I think you'll find it not only inspirational, but wonderful learning for all of us who have been schooled in very uhm, I almost wanna say, traditional ways of counseling. 

00:01:05
ALLEN IVEY Yes. 

00:01:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO But ah, in ways that I think, we're learning through this series ah, ways that we need to learn more about. Today's presenters are from Nevada, they are Dr. Art Martinez and Nora Martinez. I'd also like to acknowledge that this series is a joint venture between Division 45, the Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues and Microtraining Associates, Allen's organization. 

00:01:30
ALLEN IVEY So, let us begin. 

00:01:35
ART MARTINEZ  Good afternoon. My name is, ah, Dr. Art Martinez, I'm a clinical psychologist with the Washoe Family Trauma Healing Center in Gardnerville, Nevada. This afternoon, we're going to be demonstrating some techniques of engaging native families, ah, in a way that might be typical, ah, of the native family coming into our clinic in the Indian Health Service, and we'll be looking at four critical points. A critical point of engagement and introduction, a point of recognition, uhm, of issues within the family, and how to join the, as the parent as a representative of their family, and how to, uhm, how then we might turn those issues to the family's benefit and, of course, to the individual client's benefit. I have ah, with me, our fictitious Ms. Pete, who will be playing, ah, ah, the role of the client here. And so we'll just go ahead and begin. Good afternoon, Ms. Pete, how are you? 

00:03:00
MS. PETE Fine. 

00:03:00
ART MARTINEZ I know we met before, but ah, just to refresh your memory, ah, I know we had a lot of forums and, and other things that, I'm sorry, we had to go through, ah, ah, at intake, but I thought I'd tell you a little bit of my, about myself before we get ah, to started, we did have uhm, some time to go through some checklists of issues that your family is dealing with, uhm, at our prior meeting. Ah, let me tell you a little bit about myself just to start. Uhm, my name is Art Martinez, I'm a member of the Chumash tribe. I'm from the Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez Bands, and, ah, our tribe is predominantly one of the predominant tribes in California. Uhm, I noticed that you're here from the local area. Ah, is, are you related to several bands in here in the local area or several families? 

00:03:55
MS. PETE  Yes, I am. I'm a Paiute. 

00:04:00
ART MARTINEZ All right. 

00:04:00
MS. PETE I'm from Dresselville, uh hmm. 

00:04:05
ART MARTINEZ Uh hmm. Do you uhm, I understand from the, the brief discussion that we had last time that your, your family, uhm, has been going through some transitional problems lately, uhm, and also some understanding you come from a very deep traditional background within your family, could you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:04:25
MS. PETE  Well, uhm, you mean as far as, uhm, with the issues in my household or about my, about my traditional family? 

00:04:45
ALLEN IVEY Whichever one you wanna start with you. 

00:04:45
MS. PETE  Okay. Well, uhm, I come from a, uhm, from a traditional family. Uhm, my family here is highly respected, but uhm, the reason that I'm here to see you is, uhm, I need help. I have, uhm, three daughters, they're 6, 9, and 12. And, uhm, my husband is an alcoholic and, uhm, I feel like uhm, things have gotten out of control and my family is falling apart. And I don't know what to do. 

00:05:35
ART MARTINEZ Uh hmm. Your family are the, the Petes from this area? (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
MS. PETE Yes, uh hmm. 

00:05:40
ART MARTINEZ Yes, I know, I know of their family. They're a very large and traditional family. Uhm, when we talked earlier, we talked about how deeply you feel about the traditional values within your family and within your culture... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
MS. PETE Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
ART MARTINEZ  uhm, probably, the first thing I wanted to say today is I, I wanted to thank you for showing up today. I know it must be really hard for you, uhm, to seek help. I know the drug and alcohol counseling program has been putting some pressure on you to come in. And in that way, that's, maybe that's okay. That's the way that the community maybe of, of recovering people is saying that we all need to do our own individual work. Does that sound okay with you? Is that something you're willing to do? 

00:06:30
MS. PETE Yes. 

00:06:30
ART MARTINEZ All right. Uhm, when we talked earlier, you talked, ah, you mentioned that ah, your husband is seeking ah, recovery from his alcohol issues? 

00:06:45
MS. PETE He's trying, yes. 

00:06:50
ART MARTINEZ Uh hmm. 

00:06:50
MS. PETE Uh hmm. 

00:06:50
ART MARTINEZ Is he going to in-patient care or is he... (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
 Yes. 

00:06:50
ART MARTINEZ ...going to a half-way house, or? (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
MS. PETE He's going to an in-patient drug and alcohol treatment. 

00:06:55
ART MARTINEZ Okay. So if I'm understanding right, then your interest in coming here would be to find recovery for yourself and for your family around issues of ah, either co-dependency or alcoholism, how this may have affected your family? 

00:07:20
MS. PETE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
ART MARTINEZ Does that sound about right? 

00:07:20
MS. PETE Yes. Uhm, my three daughters, ah, especially the two older ones are starting to uhm, to get into trouble, you know, with other teens and I'm afraid that ah, that they'll start drinking. And I'm trying to figure out how to ah, prevent this from happening. 

00:07:35
ART MARTINEZ  When you come in to seek help, it seems as though uhm, you come here very concerned about your family, is that true? 

00:07:50
MS. PETE  Yes. 

00:07:55
ART MARTINEZ Your, your concerns are for your children? 

00:07:55
MS. PETE Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
ART MARTINEZ  All right. That's really appropriate. Last time we talked, we, we talked about how the history of your family, ah, your family roots here in the community... (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
MS. PETE Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
ART MARTINEZ  runs so deep and so strong and in a very traditional way, it seems that your family uhm, expectations, let's say, of your grandparents who I know aren't around anymore. 

00:08:20
MS. PETE Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
ART MARTINEZ But your grandparents, uhm, that have raised you originally... (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
MS. PETE Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
ART MARTINEZ ...uhm, had expectations of you that maybe you feel you haven't fulfilled, is that it? 

00:08:35
MS. PETE Uhm, yes, that's true. Uhm, my grandfather was uhm, a, was a Sweat leader and, uhm, my grandparents had, uhm, had trained me to, uhm, to run Sweats and they had hoped, uhm, that when it was time, that I would do this and then I would also uhm, the one I married that, uhm, that we would raise our children in this way, and it, it hasn't happened. 

00:09:05
ART MARTINEZ  So your part then is that you will be able to raise your children in the way that your grandparents had intended their great, their great grandchildren to be raised? 

00:09:20
MS. PETE Yes. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
ART MARTINEZ And to carry on... (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
MS. PETE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
ART MARTINEZ ...ah, a healthy way? 

00:09:25
MS. PETE Uh hmm. 

00:09:25
ART MARTINEZ How, how long have you had this desire to following the, the ah, road that was laid out for you? Most of your life or has it been a more recent pressure? 

00:09:45
MS. PETE It's been more of a recent. Uhm, when I first married, I, I kinda got lost there for a while and I'd say in the last five years, it's been really strong, but I didn't know how to, uhm, uhm, I was too embarrassed to ask my family for help and, uhm, I, I just didn't know how to, to get, how to start and how to, uhm, you know, because we didn't raise our children the way that I was raised. 

00:10:25
ART MARTINEZ  Well, I'm, I'm very honored that you were, that you're able to come here, that you found a strength in yourself and I know it probably took a lot of courage for you to come here, uhm, and to seek help in this way. In reality, what we're doing is we're hoping to change the history of your family, aren't we? 

00:10:50
MS. PETE Yes. 

00:10:50
ART MARTINEZ Uhm, and maybe to bring your family back on to the red road or the road of, of, uhm, spiritual ways that you've been taught. Uhm, what are you, what do you do currently that, ah, that maybe that's consistent with that? Do you go to Sweat ceremonies or any kind of spiritual program? 

00:11:10
MS. PETE  I go to Sweat, uhm, once a month, sometimes every other month and sometimes, uhm, I try to get my children to go with me and, uhm, sometimes that's difficult and I end up going by myself, but, ah, I would like to, you know, to encourage them to go. 

00:11:35
ART MARTINEZ When you go there, do you feel like you're part of the community of people in that Sweat circle? 

00:11:40
MS. PETE Where I go? Yes, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
ART MARTINEZ Okay. So you feel very comfortable there? 

00:11:40
MS. PETE  Yes. 

00:11:45
ART MARTINEZ All right. One of the things that we might talk about later is would between, ah, ways of increasing your participation there and building on that strength of, in, in spiritual foundation that you already have. At this point though, let's, let's just take a look at what we're doing. We're really talking about some important issues here. Uhm, some issues that may effect, affect your family and your children's families for generations to come. It seems as though a long time ago, the Creator set your family upon a path and that path was handed down generation to generation, somewhere within your generation and maybe generations before you that you, your family somehow got diverted from that path. Does that seem, does that seem true to you, that's really true? (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
MS. PETE Yes. Yes. 

00:12:45
ART MARTINEZ Uhm, so the, the work that we were talking about doing here, even though it may not have been, uhm, the most comfortable thing to come into the office and to ask for help, I know how hard that must be, but the, but the Creator gave you the strength to do it, and I think you're really to be honored. I'm, I'm very honored that you came in. We have to honor that commitment, we have to honor that work, you know, uhm, through the work that we set forward to do. That work, uhm, will involve, first of all, getting yourself healthy or healthier in a way that you can, uhm, begin to follow in the ways that, that had been laid out for you and we may need to bring your daughters in also uhm, to talk about how we change the, the family history, so to speak, for future generations. Uhm, does that sound like something you're ready for? 

00:13:50
MS. PETE That's why I'm here, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
ART MARTINEZ Okay. Do you, do you believe that your husband also is interested in that, changing the family history in that way? 

00:14:00
MS. PETE  We both come from the same background but I don't feel, uhm, that it's as, ah, strong in him as it is in me, no. 

00:14:15
ART MARTINEZ Okay. So you're, you have, you both have your own personal work to do and whether that he continues as part of your family will be something that you'll have to decide later, and maybe you're not ready to decide that right now. That's okay. Uhm, as we begin to change this direction in your family, a big part of that is gonna be getting yourself healthy. Now, I know we kind of don't think of ourselves a lot, we tend to think of our children and we tend to think of everyone else in the world. Uhm, is that okay if we talk about that? About what it might, what you might do, uhm, to set your life, your own personal life on the red road? 

00:15:00
MS. PETE Uh hmm. Yes. 

00:15:00
ART MARTINEZ Okay. Part of that red road might be recovery, part of that red road might be facing some issues that you carry with you and that, that ah, you may have even passed on inadvertently, uhm, or lived with your children. I'm sure there's been a lot of trauma in your life given the, the, the brief history that you've already told me. Uhm, and I'd like your permission to be able to talk about those things with you. Would that be all right? 

00:15:25
MS. PETE Yes. 

00:15:25
ART MARTINEZ  All right. Well, the next time we come in we'll talk about that. We wouldn't normally cut the session that short but for the purpose of this demonstration, there are some critical factors, uhm, that I think I'd like to highlight at this point. One is that in our, in our greeting of, ah, Ms. Pete, we, I thanked her, thanked her, uhm, for having the courage to come in, for having the courage to, uhm, begin to change, ah, some things that are problematic that she identifies as problematic within her family, uhm, so that we might change the history of her family. Uhm, I'm taking the stand, the stand in speaking for her relatives in a sense and thanking and honoring her, uhm, and also being honored for ah, being a part of that change. One of the other issues, uhm, that we have discussed and, and looked at is that history of struggle and, uhm, that, and what we will look at and we've got a permission to look at now, is the traumatic history of the family and how the traumatic history has basically led this family to a point where, uhm, the family is, is, uhm, seeking help, ah, from professionals. And it's, it's very important to understand when native people that's seeking help from professionals may be the hardest thing, uhm, to do. Typically native families, native individuals will not come in under their own volition but through the suggestion of someone else or even the pressure of someone else. In that respect, we talk about changing the family history by beginning to make the individuals within the immediate family healthier by setting out on a road of traditional healing that is congruent with what, uhm, the mother has already identified as her goals. This will be important in the sense that immed, an immediate behavioral change within the family, uhm, will allow the family to feel, feel reinforced and feel like some, they are getting something out of the, ah, the therapy. Engaging the family through the mother, through, through an individual and allowing the family to, ah, extending your hand, I should say, and, uhm, and joining the family and allowing the family to define its own, its own change is also an important issue. Also in, in a, uhm, respectful way, it's very important to engage and confront the issues that, ah, the mother herself may have to deal with and be there, uhm, as a, as an assistant to this process, uhm, as there will be many other assistants in this process. That assistantship will come from other family members, from traditional leaders and elders, from the community of people that we had discussed her joining the Sweat Lodge circle, uhm, and through other resources that we just have not identified yet. As we go forward in therapy, we then start with one person of the family, of a very important person, a leader of her immediate family and we begin then to engage others as time is appropriate. Uhm, in that sense what we've done is we have taken the family, taken a, we have taken recognition of the fact that this family has come into the office as maybe a gesture of last hope. Uhm, we have given them a little bit of hope that things could be get, could be better and then talked about how we will begin to, how the family can begin to raise up again, uhm, to find a life that was meant to be ah, for this family. Along that road, we're gonna spend a great deal of time talking about the traumatic events, the traumatic history of the family ah, for many generations back that has beaten the self-esteem, the honor, the cohesiveness of the family down, uhm, to this point. Uhm, but it's very important to have behavioral change start immediately. So, in, in that ah, light, I would hope I had given some tools that might be useful in, ah, joining native families, uhm, in this very important process of change and healing. Thank you. 

00:21:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  All right. Well, I'm going to start this discussion and, again, thank you for joining us and sharing with us a very rich vignette. Ah, there's so much to take away from this, so, we have two or three questions that we're trying to ask ah, with each vignette and this, the first question focuses on the multi-cultural competencies. We've talked about the need to be culturally competent in order to work in a culture specific environment. Uhm, from your perspective, if you were to recommend to a non-native person who's, who wants to do counseling with a native person, a couple of recommendations you would make about being culturally competent. 

00:22:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  What do you think, Nora? 

00:22:15
NORA MARTINEZ  I think that's very important because, uhm, as it was mentioned earlier, you know, it's very hard for native people to uhm, to ask for help. 

00:22:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:22:30
NORA MARTINEZ And, uhm, and it's very important that the counselor understands, uhm, a native, ah, cultural ways because that's part of what, uhm, you know, their problems are. You know, they've lost their way... (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
NORA MARTINEZ ...and, uhm, you know, they should talk about their dreams... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh-hmm. 

00:22:55
NORA MARTINEZ ...or, uhm, and dreams are very important to a native people and if the counselor doesn't understand what they're saying then they've lost the ah, you know, the client and they won't come back again. 

00:23:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO All right. Do have any examples, Art? 

00:23:10
NORA MARTINEZ You can add to that. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
ART MARTINEZ Oh, I think one of the things I would want a, a non-native therapist to, to understand would be that, uhm, it's very hard for, for the native client to walk through the door... (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:23:25
ART MARTINEZ ...and to admit uhm, that there are problems that the best minds of their family, the best efforts of their family have not been able to overcome. Ah, that can be a great embarrassment... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh-hmm. 

00:23:35
ART MARTINEZ ...in some sense to uhm, ah, to the client that is coming in. Because of that ah, factor and because we're not, we don't typically ask for help, in general, uhm, we are way of communicating that we need help is to have others look at us and see that we need help and then assist us. Uhm, so, I would, ah, take particular time to honor the person for their, for making the step... (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
ART MARTINEZ  uhm, on their own. Even if that's step has been somehow coerced through a court order, through a uhm, referral, ah, through part of the treatment program, anything like that, uhm, important than that step is that not that the person is being coerced, but that the person has been given permission by those, uhm, referring agencies, ah, that are saying that the community has identified that they need help... (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
ART MARTINEZ ...or that they need assistance or that they may be need to change the course of the way things are going within their family. And so typically, ah, native families will come in, uhm, under the guise of the, the people, whoever the people are... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Right. 

00:24:55
ART MARTINEZ ...have said I should talk to you. 

00:24:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO That sounds very powerful to come that way as well. It's not uhm, it's not the individual, but again, it's the collective, it's a group caring about that individual. 

00:25:05
ART MARTINEZ Right, it is and we, we don't ah, ah, the person doesn't have to own blame... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
ART MARTINEZ ...or embarrassment... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

00:25:10
ART MARTINEZ  in that sense. 

00:25:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

00:25:15
ALLEN IVEY One of the things that you highlighted which I thought was incredibly important was that issue of trauma, and ah, I know from ah, Eduardo de Terran's(ph) (inaudible ) book is that really, uhm, we should not deal really with any native American Indian client without awareness that there is a vast history of trauma and a recurring trauma and awareness of that issue. And ah, I thought that would be well worth highlighting just a bit a more. 

00:25:45
ART MARTINEZ Well, yeah, the uhm, it's important uhm, as a native person ah, I can say when, with a native client that I'm glad they're here, I'm glad they're here for two reasons. One is that now we can begin on, begin working on therapeutic change, ah, for their family. Uhm, but in addition, just that their family and my family survived... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
ART MARTINEZ ...to this point. Uhm, against all odds, actually... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
ART MARTINEZ  uhm, and though that carnage still continues today... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh-hmm. 

00:26:25
ART MARTINEZ  ah, with the native communities. Ah, the removal of native children from their homes and placement in non-native homes still uhm, accounts for ah, depending on whose figures you, you operate by as much as a quarter of all of the children in our communities. Uhm, those levels of trauma that are caused by, uhm, violence, alcoholism, depression, other things within that, that impact our families, uhm, are something that native people have, have learned ah, to self-blame about, uhm, rather than to, ah, take an, an active stand in changing that history. 

00:27:15
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, I've been working just this past ah, I've worked back up with the past 15, 20 years with aboriginal people in Australia. And ah, it's been fascinating to watch the change in consciousness and distinctions between, say, Australia and the U.S. A major issue in the newspapers currently in Australia is stolen children. And the Australian Psychiatric Association has come out and recognized their complicity in this. And it's, you know, and, and it's quite a shock to me when I'm working, say, with David Rathman down there. And he says, "My mother was taken from the front of her home without any notification of the family. Well, that was perhaps, 19, you know, well, that's perhaps 50 years ago, but then we're working on the Tiwi islands with the 24-year-old who still was taken away from her family under very similar conditions. And I would, myself, I get pretty angry about the complicity of American psychologists and social workers, and what I see is an ongoing issue. 

00:28:20
ART MARTINEZ Well, in, uhm, furthermore, in, in the United States that's been uhm, that was actually, that complacency was actually found and cited in, in federal law... (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
ART MARTINEZ ...uhm, over 20 years ago. The native people today uhm, one of the barriers to getting services is that, ah, in the not-so-recent past and in this, in, in the present, in many communities ah, taking the step to getting help in the community, ah, can be a real jeopardy to the family itself... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
ART MARTINEZ ...it can, it can result in losing the children. Uhm, I have seen, ah, clients who are young people today, who can tell you that, uhm, they were being raised in their village or in their community. And ah, when they were very young, maybe five or six years old that they remember a bus pulling up and that a church group was gonna take all the children to, to go get ice cream or to on some outing and that was the last time they ever saw their families or community. Uhm, they come ah, to us now saying how do I now begin to raise my children? How do I teach my children everything that was meant for my family to live and I don't know that myself. 

00:29:50
ALLEN IVEY And, and one of the things that corns, concerns me is the failure of white folks, European-Americans, to acknowledge even that this happened. Ah, as my own state here in Massachusetts, of course, refuses to recognize any, most of the native people. And liberal Massachusetts, I think in some ways is with the most depressive, one of the most depressive of all states. 

00:30:10
ART MARTINEZ  Well, liberal California which I have a great deal of experience with, uhm, also uhm, suffers from some of the same... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:30:20
ART MARTINEZ ...issues. Uhm, some. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
ALLEN IVEY For me, part of this is ah, that the role of the psychologist, this ties in something you're saying earlier, Art. It isn't just doing individual therapy, I think there is a responsibility for white European psychologist is to get in the community and become aware of some of these socio-political issues which (inaudible ) rather than us, other psychologists, social work... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm 

00:30:50
ALLEN IVEY ...many times are part of the problem, rather than. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
ART MARTINEZ I think part of that problem comes from a, uhm, from being thoughts of our collective ah, educational experiences... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO (inaudible ) 

00:31:06
ART MARTINEZ ...that, uhm, somehow we, as psychologists, have to be uhm, respected and revered by the client... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Hmm. 

00:31:15
ART MARTINEZ ...and that in, in that respect and reverence, the client will get better... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
ART MARTINEZ ...through their trust in us. That, that may, that's a, uhm, a foundational assumption that may work, I'm not sure it does, but it may work for European ah, cultures, but it certainly doesn't work for native cultures. And native cultures, uhm, our helpers, our healers, our prayer leaders and singers are all part of the community that they are uhm, when, when you help someone, they become like a relative... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
ART MARTINEZ ...because they become part of your circle of healing that's going on. And so, in that sense, uhm, the psychologists can be, ah, very effective as one of those many people in the community that stands ready to help. Uhm, it's important for psychologists to understand that when a client walks into your office or your room, it, ah, that you may be the, this may be the first time that, that client has said to anyone in that... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
ART MARTINEZ ...in that community of health that uhm, they actually need help. And if they're not, ah, if they don't see hope there that ah, it may be also the last time. 

00:32:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO This discussion has been very helpful because as, as we're closing here, what it certainly puts in front of us is this challenge that we've been talking about and that is the way we've all been trained as psychologists. 

00:32:55
NORA MARTINEZ Uh huh. 

00:32:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO It certainly leaves a lot of gap in what we need to know in order to be competent from cultures, specific perspectives uhm, there's just a great deal of education that we need to have in order to understand, you know, whether it's native ways, Asian perspectives, Latino perspectives, African-American, you know, philosophy and, and how that affects helping. And clearly that's nothing that any of us where trained in, so, we're beginning at least to move in those directions and, and thank you ah, very, very much again for opening the door to all of us. 

00:33:30
ALLEN IVEY  All right. Thank you very much, Patricia.
