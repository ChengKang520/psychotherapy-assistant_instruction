ADAM Hello. Umm… I'm here to talk about American-Indian recruitment.

Oh yeah, you're that Indian boy, right? 

00:00:20
ADAM Umm… Yeah, my name is Adam. We’re supposed to talk about how the University goes about recruiting American Indians. 

00:00:25
Well, the University does general recruitment, nothing special for any one group. 

00:00:30
ADAM Umm… Well, could you give me some details on what general recruitment would be. 

00:00:40
Well, as I hope you know the University admits students based on merit, nothing else, so.

You know what, I’m really busy right now, so if you really wanna talk about this just schedule a meeting with my secretary outside.

00:01:10
Tom, I didn’t think you’re gonna make it. 

00:01:10
TOM Yeah, I am late sorry about that. 

00:01:15
It’s okay. I mean, you are ready for this test?

BLACK Adam, if I remember, you were telling me about those Med school interviews you had. 

00:01:25
ADAM Oh yeah, yeah. I had ah… two last week. They went up pretty good. And I think, I got really good chance to getting into both of those. 

00:01:35
Good for you man, good for you. 

00:01:35
ADAM How about you? 

00:01:35
BLACK I’ve got one coming up tomorrow night, and two scheduled for next week. So, I’m pretty happy about it, yeah. 

00:01:40

00:01:40
TOM Wow, that crazy! I've been waiting for a response, an invitation and you know, we haven't got a single thing.

ADAM Uh…Huh… 

00:01:55
TOM Do you think may be there is a different standard for different people? 

00:02:00
ADAM What are you trying to say? Because… What… Because I’m American-Indian, I got a better chance of getting in? 

00:02:05
No, I mean, I just… I don't think we’re saying that. I mean, it’s just, you know, you've got much interviews, we got none, and we got pretty similar scores on the test, I mean. 

00:02:15
ADAM On another score. 

00:02:15
I’m just told… I mean, I don't know.

Jackie, I asked you to come in this afternoon because I understand that you did not participate in the group project. And we need to talk about why and the impact that's going to have on your grade. 

00:02:50
JACKIE I know, I feel really worried about this. But you know when it come to discussion, group discussion, it was really hard for me to speak out my ideas because a lot of time, because my English is not that good, a lot of time when I come up to ideas, people already talk a lot and I couldn't jump in. 

00:03:15
Well, I am very sympathetic with the situation that you’re talking about, however you need to remember that we do have a syllabus, that your grade is going to depend strongly on your participation in this. And so you’re just going to have to overcome these fears. Otherwise, you are going to end up failing this class.

00:06:26
It is for the creation of funding for an Asian-American Institute on campus.

00:06:30
Well, for one it creates a really safe environment. For Asian-Americans or anyone else like just to come together and learn about Asian-American culture. 

00:06:40
But, I mean, don’t we learn enough about Asian-American culture in class? 

00:06:45
Well, actually for me, before I came here, I didn't learn anything about Asian-Americans. And so, coming here, I did… I took it upon myself to learn about, you know, not only immigration acts and building ten continents of railroad ah… you there is… To direct a issue, Asian-American studies, this own issue and just helping on (inaudible ) people.

And he goes; “Bob, come on, you know, we don't have all day, let’s… let’s… let’s get it going.” And the guy who is about to hit it goes; “Well, you know my wife is up in the clubhouse, so want to hit a perfect shot.” And the partner goes,”Bob, you’ll never be able to hit her from here.” 

00:08:20

Why… Why would one ever think of you know hitting his wife?

00:08:45
Funny! 

00:08:45
Yeah, that she would get hit by a golf ball. 

00:08:45
Funny! 

00:08:45
Hitting his wife is funny? 

00:08:50
Umm… It won't… May be just with a… with a golf, the thought of it is funny. He is not actually going to do it. But… 

00:08:55
No, but to think, you know, the other guy thinks that he’s actually…

REKHA (ph) Hey Adam.

ADAM Hello, Rekha(ph).

REKHA (ph) I just got out of this anthropology class.

REKHA (ph) And I know you’re native American, right?

REKHA (ph) Well, we’re doing this really cool dig at St. Augustine. We’re going to dig up burial mounds, native American burial mounds. I think, that’s so cool. I think, you should check it out. I mean… 

00:12:40
ADAM You’re digging out mounds? Haven’t anthropologists dug up all the mounds in Florida already and you're digging out more for just a stupid project? 

00:12:45
REKHA (ph) Well, why you offend it? I mean, this is something good as for science, it’s for knowledge. We can get all this information before it all goes away, put it into a book… 

00:12:55
ADAM This is… 

00:12:55
REKHA (ph) …so we can always have it. 

00:12:55
ADAM Native people have never dug up bones. It goes totally against our spiritual believes and it’s just something that we never would do. It would be desecrating our ancestors if we did it. 

00:13:05
REKHA (ph) But, you’ll be learning about your culture. I mean, your people, your culture, where you came from, this is important. 

00:13:10

“Family Expectations” Scene: Friends talking in dorm room 

00:13:25
Hi! How is it going? What’s the matter? 

00:13:25
I’m sad. I’m angry. Eh… Nothing my parents, they make me angry all the time. Umm… I mean, all the time (inaudible ) but they want me to be something that I’m not and I don’t want to be what they want me to be. 

00:13:40
Hold on, don’t you wanna be a doctor? 

00:13:45
No, I don’t wanna be a doctor. I wanna be an artist. I wanna create works of awry. I wanna people admire my… my artistic talents, stuff like that. 

00:13:50
So, wait, so, if you wanna be an artist then why don’t you be an artist? 

00:13:55
Because my parents don’t want me to be an artist. They want me to be a doctor. They think that’s the only great thing out there. 

00:14:00
Because your parents don’t want you to be an artist. Who care your parents think? 

00:14:05
No, but I care of my parents saying… 

00:14:05
How old are you, 12? 

00:14:05
No, I’m 18. 

00:14:10
And you’re in college? 

00:14:10
That doesn’t mean anything. I mean, they’re still my parents. I still care for them. I wanna make them proud. I just, you know, I don’t want to be something going on so well. 

00:14:15
Are they gonna be here 20 years from now? 

00:14:20
No, but still. 

00:14:20
So then? 

00:14:20
I mean… Well, you don’t know that, may be my parents well. I mean, I have to look after them when they’re older. I mean, that’s just the way it is, the law you know. 

00:14:30
So that you’re gonna looking after them unhappy being a doctor? Does that make any sense? 

00:14:30
I don’t know. It’s just that they’ll be happy and if they’re happy… 

00:14:35
They’ll listen to all of these excuses. Why don’t you just call your parents and tell them that you don’t wanna be a doctor? 

00:14:40
No, because they’ll never understand. It’s not that easy. You know my parents work so hard for me to come to school, be a better person, and then you know all of a sudden like, no I don’t wanna be a doctor, I want to be some artist. 

00:14:50
Hello they’re your parents, they’re gonna understand . They’re not just gonna disown you, are they? 

00:14:50
Just may. You don’t know mam. My mom is pretty rough. I mean, she sometimes that she takes a decision she doesn’t go back. I don’t know, I’m just scared. I mean, I don’t want to make them upset or anything. 

00:15:00
I have an idea. 

00:15:00
What? 

00:15:00
Why don’t we call your parents? 

00:15:00
No, you’re crazy. I would not. 

00:15:05
Come on you (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:15:05
No, my parents will not… No, stop. What are you doing? No, my parents will never know what are you on. 

00:15:10
Talk to her, talk to her. 

00:15:10
Hello, mummy!

”Caught between two cultures” Scene: Student expresses her confusion 

00:27:50
Whether you like it or not when people look at you, you’re judged based on your appearance. Being biracial, in case people hold bunch of other questions to ask you as to where are you coming from umm… Who… Like… What… What sort of ethnicity are you? What’s your makeup? What… Who is your parent? Is your parent white or is your parent black? And I think for me it’s been difficult. Umm… I grew up in a rich affluent suburbia with my white mother and my coincidentally white step-father as well. And I was never really exposed to what it was like to be African American. There is definitely African American kids at my school, but it was sort of like everybody stuck together. And so that’s what (inaudible ) so where is my place. Umm… In returning to and coming down to college, it was sort of the same experience. I mean, as you walk through our main campus area, you see that all the black African American students are all clustered together and you know everybody else just sort of walks through and passing. And the question then comes up as to where… where should I go? Should I stay what I’m comfortable or should I really start exposing myself to something that I’m uncomfortable with and something that I’m new to? But at the same time, it’s definitely still part of who I’m and where I come from. Umm… So the question then comes up as to, I mean, where… where I should go in campus? I mean, I’m one student in 40,000 and… and how can I find my place? What organizations should I join and again I know there are multi-cultural organizations, but then you see the white sororities and the black sororities and you think about well, which one can I join? I would feel, definitely feel uncomfortable on the African American sorority because I don’t even feel like I understand wherein these people are coming from, but then also in the white sorority, it sort of like I’m tired of being that different person and I’m tired of being the person that sort of sticks out and stands out, because I don’t have the blonde hair and brown eyes or the brown hair and the green eyes or whatever it may be. People notice that I’m different. So here… here I have it as in sort like the same… same scenario as before. I’m at college, I’m a student and I’m trying to figure out where my place is and where do I fit in. You know and this sort of difficult in the sense that you don’t want to choice one or the other, because you also know that both cultures are part for who you are today. But, at the same time, you almost feel like you have to. And then you think about what’s going to be socially acceptable. I mean, what I be, would it be acceptable for me to be hanging out with other people African Americans when I’m obviously going to be, the lighter skinned one out there or if I’m hanging out with the… a whole group of white people, well I also be, I’ll also obviously standout at the same time. So, sort of like who should I hangout with and where should it be and what would people think of me as I go with each or none of the groups for that matter.

W. Max Parker, Ph.D. and Chun-Chung Choi, Ph.D. University of Florida Gainesville, Florida The short vignettes presented in this DVD were developed and role played by students based on their own experiences of the experiences of others. These are the reflections of the actual encounters of the students in their daily lives on campus. These vignettes are powerful and dynamic stimulators for group discussions. In field tests and trial runs, participants became excited and anxious to talk when certain characters or scenes with which they could identity were presented. While we are pleased to share some of the ways we have used this tool successfully, we strongly encourage facilitators to tailor the scenarios to meet their group needs. The more creative the facilitators can be, the greater value the DVD will be for them. Thank you!
