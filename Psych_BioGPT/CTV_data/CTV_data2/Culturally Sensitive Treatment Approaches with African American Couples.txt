THERAPY Talks

KATHERINE B. HELM What is a culturally sensitive counselor? Do they behave differently than other counselors? I mean how do we know we're being culturally competent? The American Psychological Association says that culturally competent counselors have a particular knowledge base, a certain set of skills, and a high level of awareness. Awareness about themselves, their own cultural background, as well as the client's background in which they're working. I believe that culturally sensitive counselors, I think that awareness is the absolute most important thing to be a culturally sensitive counselor. Now I consider myself to be a student of multicultural issues. I study on the topic, write on the topic, read on the topic, and yet I still struggle to figure out exactly what is culturally sensitive counseling. I've recently had the pleasure of seeing a gay married couple in couples counseling. The elder member of the couple is 37 years old and was born and raised in China. And the younger member of the couple is about 26 years of age and was born and raised in the United States and is half Mexican American and also of Irish descent. This couple has come struggling with several issues. They've been married for two years and they were together one year prior to them getting married. They also moved from some southern states to some northern states to go to school. Some of the things that the couple is struggling with is communication and they have lower levels of emotional intimacy. They are not getting along very well. One of the things that the elder member of the couple said, the man from China, is “We fight too much. We have way too much conflict and it makes me wanna get a divorce. This is not healthy.” And the younger member of the couple told me, “I don't think there's anything wrong with conflict. I think conflict can be healthy.” One of the things I was able to do with the couple is join with them, and I will talk to you a little bit about the importance of joining with the couple, becoming part of the couple system by recognizing all of the cultural variables operating their relationship very early on in our sessions together. I think that culturally competent counselors are aware of how cultural issues operate in a couple's relationship. I think culturally sensitive treatment with African American couples means you have to recognize particular cultural factors and specific threats to intimacy. Many of these threats operate completely outside of the couple's control but deeply impact the couple's relationship. A lot of these contextual factors have to do with the negative legacy of slavery that we continue to deal with today. I liken slavery to a black cloud that hangs over our heads and we breathe it in and we're completely unaware of how it impacts our lives. And yet it has forever positioned race and our understanding of race in society as well as the idea that African Americans are problem people whether or not we individually believe that, that is how many African Americans are positioned. This deeply impacts couples. As a result, many African American couples are dealing with specific threats to intimacy like internalized negative gender stereotypes. African American men being unmotivated, criminals, threats to society. African American women being angry, domineering, emasculating and unfeminine. And frequently these couples not only internalize these gender stereotypes, which may sometimes be passed down to them from their own families, but then treat one another sometimes unconsciously negatively based on these stereotypes. Two out of every three or 67 percent of African American marriages fail. Why is this? What's happening here? I also think it's incredibly important for culturally competent counselors to explore the connection between family of origin issues and the issues currently operating the couple. Now I do this by meeting the couple for a session as a couple, kind of getting their mutual assessment of what's happening, going over the ground rules for couples counseling, for example; letting them know that they, the couple, is my client, not individually and that I won't keep secrets. And then I separate them for the very next session and do an hour of individual counseling with them each so I can get a good understanding of how they grew up, what the important adults were in their life, and how specific family of origin issues impact their relationship. A culturally sensitive approach that comes to us from feminist therapy has to do with gender analysis. Now John Gotman, who I'll talk about later, is kind of the couples, our modern day couples guru, if you will. And he talks about how the assessment process can be very powerful for couples because it can get them to get a complete understanding of what's happening in their relationship as well as set goals for treatment. Part of this would be to look at gender roles. Gender role analysis might include things like asking each member of the couple, “How are gender roles distributed in your family?” ”How do you perceive men and women?” The same thing for power roles. Looking at how power is distributed in a couple. This to me is part of the couple's contract. Do they agree? Who is the primary decision maker? Does one member of the couple feel the other has more power than the other? I think these are important things to know and also culturally sensitive treatment approaches. In African American couples, power is not typically distributed by gender, but frequently by who has the time, also what is the negotiation. And because African American couples tend to be more gender egalitarian, power roles do not necessarily fall down by gender. So this is an important area of assessment. Now Nancy Boyd Franklin, whose foundational work really sort of helped lead the way to looking at the contextual factors that influence black families and black couples. And she talked about the importance of strength based assessment. When I say strength based assessment, what I mean is assessing the strengths of the couple. How the couple got through times of crisis. How have they successfully negotiated conflicts in the past? Many African American couples respond extremely well when the clinician looks at their strengths. I've already talked about the importance of understanding and assessing the impact of racism and oppression on the couple's lives because again, many couples are completely unaware of how these factors are operating. Many African Americans are aware that they affect their daily lives but not necessarily that they may bring them home and enact this negativity with their partners. Finally, I believe that as APA says, culturally sensitive counselors are aware of their own values and biases and how they impact your relationship with your clients. It's important to understand not only your own world view, but what your couples' is and indirectly incorporate their world view into the treatment process, which gives the couple more buy in to what you're doing. I also think it's incredibly important and also very culturally sensitive to understand the diversity of African American families. African American couples and families should not be compared to a Euro-centric norm. Looking at the fact that many African Americans come to therapy that are married, never married, co-habitating or maybe just raising children together. So understanding the diversity of African American families is extremely important. African American children may be raised by grandparents, aunts and uncles, even play uncles and play cousins who live down the street. Raising African American children is sometimes seen as a community effort. Finally, the importance of joining. I believe the importance of joining with a couple is in some ways an emotionally intimate process. You become part of the couple's relationship. This builds credibility and it also allows the clinician excellent ways of really becoming part of the couples' dynamic and assessing what's happening. It also builds a mutual sense of trust. Now I'm gonna talk about a few culturally sensitive treatment approaches with African American couples. I'm not gonna talk about all of them. But I'm gonna talk about a few. I think awareness about how to modify treatment approaches is key here. So for example, cognitive behavioral couples' therapy focuses on discreet problems, as opposed to global ones and focuses on dysfunctional cognitions. For example; let's say you have a married couple in therapy and the woman said, “You know what? I am tired of you not taking the garbage out.” That would be a complaint. But let's say she said, “You know what? You are no good. You're a jerk because you never take the garbage out.” Well where does that cognition come from? Clearly it's harmful to the relationship. Does it come from the contextual factors of which I spoke about earlier? This idea that maybe she was raised in a family that may be passed down negative stereotypes of black men? This is something that can be looked at. So I think that looking at the context in which these cognitions occur make it a culturally sensitive approach. Now the next approach I wanna talk about is narrative therapy. Narrative therapy in itself is already inherently culturally sensitive for several reasons. One; narrative therapy talks about how reality is co-constructed and frequently influenced by the dominant narrative. So dominant majority society influences our narrative. And I'll give you an example of this. It's a well known research fact that teenage girls who look at fashion magazines of very very skinny models tend to have more negative body images. African American couples unknowingly may also internalize a norm for their relationship that's outside of themselves. So for example the dominant white majority narrative about how their relationship is supposed to proceed. What narrative therapy does is first help the couple; one, name the problem, two, externalize it. So it brings the couple together and it says, “Hey, the problem is outside of us. We need to collaboratively work to fix that problem out there. The problem is not us.” It incorporates looking at contextual factors and then empowers the couple to come up with their own new healthier narrative about themselves and their relationship. Finally, structural couples' therapy can also be culturally modified to look at, because structural couples' therapy is based on systems and it looks at problems and systems. So instead of blaming the couple themselves for the problems, it looks at the problematic systems in which the couples live in. A few more approaches here. John Gotman, as I said, our modern day couples' guru, is famous for bringing couples into his love lab. And he would watch them in video tapes and watch their interactions and said he could predict divorce rates upwards of 90 percent by viewing their interactions. And this was based on a few factors. Most importantly, he looked at four patterns which he called the four horsemen of the apocalypse. The first would be criticism. So couples frequently have complaints, you leave your socks on the floor, taking out the garbage. But if a complaint becomes generalized to the person's character, you're such a jerk because you leave your socks on the floor, that's a criticism. And that's a problem. The second problematic communication style is defensiveness. Like this. So when one member of the couple is stating a complaint, the other person is defending against it and not accepting responsibility for his or her own behavior. The third problematic communication style is contempt, and this is significantly problematic. It includes things like rolling your eyes when the other person is talking, huge sighs, huh, and even correcting the other person's grammar. Contempt is extremely problematic and it implies inherent disrespect. And the fourth area is stonewalling, which involves complete emotional withdrawal. So he looked at these areas and some ways he began to work with couples were a few. Number one he sort of encouraged couples to have a positive image, hold a positive image of your partner in your head. Two, increase the sense of we-ness or togetherness with the couple. Three, increase their sense of shared dreams and shared vision. The last culturally sensitive approach with African American couples is community based programs. And I think this is important because African Americans tend to be collectivistic. In other words, they tend to have a group identity as African Americans as well as an individual identity. And about 78 percent of African Americans state that they're either religious or spiritual. With community based programs, many African Americans who do attend church have couples' ministries available to them. So there may be an older couple who host the group at church once a week and couples get together and receive support for the issues that they're going through. So marriage is viewed and long term committed relationships are viewed as based in the community. So a couple of things in closing. I think that culturally sensitive counselors do the following; I think they're deeply aware of who they are and what they bring to the therapeutic counter. I think they are not afraid to discuss race and other differences early and often in the process. And I also think that they may acknowledge their own privilege, what they bring to the encounter, where they themselves as clinicians may be advantaged over their clients. I think these are important culturally sensitive approaches. And the last thing I wanna leave with you is this; I think that being aware and having a sense of openness and honesty is the key to culturally sensitive counseling. Thank you.

THERAPY Talks 

00:16:35
SHANNON DERMER Doctor Helm. I wanna start off first by saying I don't know how old you are but I might have to take deep personal offense to you referring to someone who's 37 as elder. 

00:16:45
KATHERINE B. HELM The elder member of the couple. Yes. I'm older than 37 if it makes you feel better. I said the elder member of the couple. 

00:16:50
SHANNON DERMER  Okay. That was a fascinating story that you started off your talk with. And I wanna ask you a few questions about it. But first, before I forget, I want to make sure and let everyone know about your book, ”Love, Intimacy and the African American Couple.” I mentioned it in the beginning but I wanted them to see it because I think it actually is a wonderful book for working with couples, especially African American couples, obviously. But I think Nancy Boyd Franklin wrote, I don't remember the last time she updated her book and that was on families. But it feels like, oh, thank goodness you've filled a void that's out there right now. I think it's been many years since she did her last addition of black families, which you referred to in your presentation. So I definitely encourage people to go out and get your book. I've actually read parts of it and looked through all the table of contents and it is an amazing source. 

00:17:50
KATHERINE B. HELM Thank you. 

00:17:50
SHANNON DERMER  I do wanna ask you some questions. You mentioned that couple in the beginning. 

00:17:55
KATHERINE B. HELM  Yes. 

00:18:00
SHANNON DERMER And obviously there were probably some big differences between you and that couple. 

00:18:05
KATHERINE B. HELM There were. There were. One of the things I think that's important is culturally sensitive counselors do not take a color blind approach. I think many of us have been raised to take a color blind approach because we consider it to be respectful. But the world doesn't operate that way. And I always ask my students, “Do you see gender?” “Yes.” “Well then you see color and race and other things.” 

00:18:25
SHANNON DERMER  We're not color blind. 

00:18:30
KATHERINE B. HELM Exactly. And taking a color blind approach doesn't really see the client nor acknowledge the world in which they live. And so with this particular couple, I really do believe that it was my ability to sort of recognize all of these cultural factors, the age difference between the two of them, educational difference and world view differences that allowed me to join with them. And in some ways they're like, ”Why didn't we see that?” And so I think being culturally sensitive really has to do with being aware. 

00:19:00
SHANNON DERMER Good. Now I have to say that awareness, sometimes when we do see obvious differences, or no obvious differences between us and our clients, sexual orientation, maybe religion, sometimes we don't know that, but race, age, some of those things might be obvious. And so it maybe compels us to explore some of those things. What about, though, cultural awareness when the outside that appears that we're actually very similar to our clients? Like maybe you working with some of your African American clients. What about cultural awareness then? 

00:19:30
KATHERINE B. HELM  I'm smiling because as I always tell my students, some of my biggest mistakes as a clinician have been with people who are culturally similar to myself cause I've made all kinds of assumptions about our mutual backgrounds that have not turned out to be true. So I believe that every interaction at its core is multicultural. Even if you're working with somebody who is you are assuming to be culturally similar. So I really do think that each culturally competent counselor does their own due diligence and tries not to make assumptions that just because you're culturally similar to the other person, that you can kind of turn off your cultural sensitivity, I think that's a mistake and I myself have fallen into that trap before. 

00:20:15
SHANNON DERMER Me too. I think it's easier to do sometimes and actually that's some of the biggest mistakes I've seen when I've supervised students. Like oh thank goodness, here's someone just like me and that's when they've gotten caught... 

00:20:25
KATHERINE B. HELM Exactly. Exactly. 

00:20:30
SHANNON DERMER I recall one where it was a student who had a strong Christian faith. And so of course we talked a lot about what will happen when you work with people who have different religions, what will happen when you work with gay and lesbian clients, talk about all that. We didn't really talk about what will happen when you work with another client who has a strong Christian background. And even though they both identified strongly with Christianity, they had very different views on Christianity and it caused a lot of problems. 

00:20:55
KATHERINE B. HELM Yeah. I can see that. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER So you're saying that of course when there are differences between the clients or differences between you and your clients, you have to be culturally aware. But you have to even remind yourself even more to be culturally aware when there are similarities. 

00:21:10
KATHERINE B. HELM Yes. And I think that culturally competent counselors bring these differences up. I mean many of us grow up in households where we're not to talk about race, you know. The little kid in the store who sees somebody who's culturally different asks the parent why is that person brown? He says shhh. Which teaches the child don't ask about that. But I think that the opposite should be true and that culturally sensitive counselors do bring these things up early in the relationship, which then gives a chance for mutual dialogue about any differences that could be interfering with the relationship. 

00:21:40
SHANNON DERMER And I'm glad you brought up narrative. I don't think as many people talk about narrative as they should which is perfect, as you mentioned, for especially cultural awareness because it really is about deconstructing whether we see ourselves as similar, different, deconstructing all of our ideas about what expectations about beauty and relationships and gender and all of those things are. And I agree whether you're part of a dominant culture or part of the non-dominant culture, we are taught don't talk about race specifically. 

00:22:15
KATHERINE B. HELM Exactly. 

00:22:15
SHANNON DERMER I remember I worked with an African American mother and her son, I think he was about 12 years old. And he started to bring up something about race at school, about how he wasn't trusted as much as the white kids that were there. He said that he felt he was picked on more, that they were quick to pick up on his misbehavior versus his white classmates. And the mother was like mortified. And she said, “No no no. I taught you not to look at race.” And it was interesting the process we had to go through where I said, “It's okay. It doesn't offend me.” And eventually she became comfortable letting her son talk about it. But it came from both ways. 

00:22:50
KATHERINE B. HELM  Yeah. What I find interesting is how can you be taught not to look at race? I mean if you can see differences in hair color you know, children achieve gender and race constancy around five years of age. So they know. And yet we're sort of teaching them something counter-intuitive. And I think that works against us as counselors in the counseling process. You know, a lot of times there's a lot of unlearning that happens, I'm sure with your students as well, that you really have to say, “You do really need to bring it up.” And that's a really scary thing to do. But the more you do it, the easier it gets. 

00:23:25
SHANNON DERMER That's a good point. A lot of times we have to unlearn what society has taught us so we can be real with our clients. 

00:23:30
KATHERINE B. HELM Yes. 

00:23:30
SHANNON DERMER Good. And so is that what's, I imagine that sometimes it's uncomfortable for clients when society says we're not supposed to speak about this, especially inter-culturally, we're not supposed to talk about race. Are some of these things you talked about taking a strength based approach and really focusing in on joining and some of those things, are those specifically to help make it more comfortable for people to talk about their cultural similarities and differences? 

00:24:00
KATHERINE B. HELM I believe so. But I also believe that when the clinician brings it up it gives a language and it makes it okay for the client to bring it up. Frequently my students will say, “Well my client didn't bring it up. So therefore it's not an issue.” And I say, “It is an issue. It does exist.” So I think that bringing these things up allows the client to be more comfortable if they wanna bring it up. A lot of times these things proceed. So for example we actually surveyed African American couples in our book and many of them did not say, “Yes, if I went to counseling, I would only wanna see an African American counselor.” Many of them said, “I just wanna be comfortable talking to the person who I'm speaking to. I want them to understand what's happening. But not necessarily race.” Oh there's African American couples who said, “Yes, I'd like an African American couples”, but many did not. 

00:24:45
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So the whole point is to, that clients may not bring up things that they want to discuss. 

00:24:50
KATHERINE B. HELM Absolutely. 

00:24:50
SHANNON DERMER  That it's our job to be comfortable being uncomfortable. 

00:24:55
KATHERINE B. HELM Yes. Absolutely. 

00:25:00
SHANNON DERMER Alright. And yes I do hear a lot of students say, “Well they didn't bring it up.” It's not their job to. It's ours. 

00:25:05
KATHERINE B. HELM Exactly. 

00:25:05
SHANNON DERMER So what are some of the things that if you only had one session with a client that you'd feel like it was your duty to bring up with them as far as being culturally aware and sensitive? 

00:25:15
KATHERINE B. HELM So is this clients that are culturally similar to myself or different? 

00:25:20
SHANNON DERMER Good question. Let's say culturally different from yourself. 

00:25:25
KATHERINE B. HELM Culturally different. I think it would be important to bring up some of the differences that I see. I think relationships are built on similarity. So I would bring up racial differences. Sometimes I bring up age differences, if there's a huge age difference because a lot of times what people wanna know is can you understand me, can you connect with people, connect with me, will these things get in the way. And by bringing it up, and if a client's like, “no no, it's fine.” Well, now you have an answer. But at least it's out there. I don't think you even have to spend a whole lot of time doing these things but being comfortable presenting the issue and putting it out there, at least allows the client if they wanna pick it up and have more of a dialogue about it, at least it gives you a basis for doing that. So I think if I had one session with the client, I think I would bring up some of the differences between us but mostly I'd be focused on what they came in with. 

00:26:15
SHANNON DERMER Good. Okay. So your main focus is what they came in with. But you also just wanna make sure that they know that you're open to talking about some of the things that they may be uncomfortable talking about? 

00:26:25
KATHERINE B. HELM Exactly. And the way that I present it is this can be a barrier to our relationship. And the relationship as we know it is a key part of counseling. 

00:26:30
SHANNON DERMER  Yes. The most important part of counseling, I believe the outcome research shows that beyond some of the things we don't have control over like are clients' communication abilities and their intelligence that the relationship is the number one predictor of outcome. 

00:26:50
KATHERINE B. HELM That's right. 

00:26:50
SHANNON DERMER And do you think that it's more difficult to create a relationship when there are obvious differences between a couple? 

00:27:00
KATHERINE B. HELM  A couple and the counselor themselves? 

00:27:05
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:27:05
KATHERINE B. HELM You know I would like to say yes but I don't think that's always true. I think sometimes it depends, couples come to counseling when they're in crisis and so a lot of times they're looking for someone to help them. So I would like to state that. But I've been wrong so many times with that in the past and made my own mistakes with people who I assumed were culturally different than I, I think it depends on so many factors. But I really do believe the first session is key. The first session is key to building the relationship and the first session is key to demonstrating cultural competence so that both people feel comfortable coming back to you. 

00:27:40
SHANNON DERMER Good. So I know you've talked about it's important for couples to be able to talk about their similarities and differences, but also you're talking about it's important for clinicians to be able to talk about their similarities and differences between them and their clients. But you also mentioned that it's not just talking about it, you as a clinician have to be aware of who you are. And we all have them, what your biases are. 

00:28:05
KATHERINE B. HELM Exactly. So for example, in the couple, the beginning of the presentation, I definitely brought up the fact that I have one individual in the room who's from China and yet has lived in the United States for over ten years. The other individual has been born and raised in the United States, is half Mexican American and of Irish descent, and I'm African American and how does that influence the interaction. And I think that was important to bring up because we're all bringing in a different perspective. And I wanted to highlight that even in here. So at home you see this perspective and now you're coming to a counselor who's culturally dissimilar as well. What does that do to our interaction? 

00:28:40
SHANNON DERMER Right. We only have a little bit of time left. So I want to again encourage everyone to find your book, I'm gonna put it up again, the camera person's gonna be mad at me. But this is a great book and explores a lot of things we talked about here today, but so much more. I also want to encourage all of you out there to look at Doctor Helm's other therapy talks and our other experts' therapy talks at the Alexander Street Press website. And Doctor Helm, I wanna thank you so much for bringing up a topic that sometimes is difficult for all of us to enact in session but is extremely important. 

00:29:25
KATHERINE B. HELM Thank you. 

00:29:25
SHANNON DERMER Thank you.
