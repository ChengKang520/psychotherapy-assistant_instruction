ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Hello I'm Dr. Robert Schwartz and I'm very pleased to speak with you about assessment, differential diagnosis and the documentation process using DSM. I'm professor in the School of Counseling in the College of Health Professions at the University Akron, and I have worked on teaching, supervising, and researching mental disorders over the past 20 years. And one thing that I have learned consistently is how important the assessment process is, in order to make an affective and an efficient diagnosis. This can be very-very complex. When you have client's coming into see you and you generally don't know what they're suffering is about. And increasingly what I've noticed in our society is that the type of suffering becomes much more multidimensional, much deeper, more profound and it causes many other types of pervasive life problems. So, it's complex to really pinpoint. How we could label a person suffering, in order to begin the treatment process and the specific interventions that you choose to use with them. So, the key to that is the assessment process. Assessment is basically gathering information with the client, in order to determine together what the source of their suffering is, how it affects their life and ultimately in order to narrow that down to a pinpoint to diagnosis, so you could communicate that to others, including the client themselves. So, let's talk first a little bit about the purposes of conducting this thorough diagnostic assessment and really it does need to be very thorough. You know, lot of people ask me well, what's, the rush, we have plenty of time to make the diagnosis right. Well actually increasingly in our manage care, health care system, we don't have much time at all. From accounts that I've received of from CEOs and presidents of mental health agencies, to clinicians, to researchers, we generally have today one or at the most, two sessions to make a diagnosis and submit that for billing and record keeping purposes. One to two sessions, that's generally one to two hours. In fact, in Ohio where I'm from, Medicaid actually only pays for two hours of assessment per year, per client that's all you are given. So, this must be done very, very quickly, very efficiently and theâ€¦ the process here is a funneling technique, where you start broad and you narrow, narrow, narrow until you come up with hopefully a pinpointed and accurate diagnosis that you can build on the rest of the process with. So, first of all in the assessment process, your main starting point is to just generally identify what signs and symptoms are present for the client, causing them suffering, emotionally, behaviorally, psychologically, spiritually? Signs are things that are observable to outside viewers, like yourselves has a clinician. So, for example, a sign of sadness might be crying, that's affect or the expression of that emotion. A sign of anxiety might be gitteringness(ph) in the seat with you, it's something that's observable from the outside. On the other hand, symptoms are things that really need to be reported by the client, these are things that are internal states like reporting, feeling nervous. If someone didn't have any signs of that and they were sitting perfectly, still you may not know they were nervous at all until they report it to you or reporting feeling depressed or reporting hallucinations or whatever it maybe that the list is potentially annulus, but you're trying to observe signs and then discuss with the client, their symptoms, so you could try and determine what are the most impairing or distressing things that the client is suffering from right now, that's the first step. Then, after you try narrow that down, to pinpoint the most important signs and symptoms currently, then you really want to determine how severe and how pervasive they're in the person's life right now. Depression is not depression is not, depression for everyone, there is no one thing that is depression for human kind. It's the same thing with anxiety or psychosis or cognitive disorders or anything in the DSM. They're different faces to every kind of disorder and one of the different faces is how severe it is. So, you can have, for example, very minor depression that may not be very impairing at all or you can have extreme depression like a client that I can remember, who was so down and so lethargic, he couldn't even move. He was so dysphoric which means intense negative affect that he couldn't even have a discussion with me. It took everything he had to even come to the session, he couldn't hold the job, because he was too depressed, his house was being foreclosed on and he just lost a significant relationship, because it was difficult, he reported for the other person to cope with his depression. So, there is any level of severity and the more severe a certain condition is, the worst prognosis, generally speaking. Prognosis is prediction of a positive outcome or prediction of recovery in treatment. So, severity is one thing to look for, the second thing is pervasiveness. Well, pervasiveness means how broad reaching, the signs and symptoms are in the person's life. What different parts of their life do these signs and symptoms touch on? Is it just something internal for them, that they are trying to cope with themselves? Or is it something that affects their friends and family, their internet relationships, their work life, their school? Any number of things. The more pervasive, the signs and symptoms are again usually the worst prognosis, for that condition and then this will affect often the level of career provide to them and the treatment interventions. Once you determine what the signs and symptoms are so you could identify them, and then you work with the client to figure out how severe they are and how impairing they are in a pervasive way, then you could finally determine through it an assessment process whether the person has a mental disorder at all. And I know that this might shock you, but someone could come in and meet with you and go through an entire assessment process and not be diagnose with the mental disorder. Surprising isn't it, but true, there are hundreds of mental disorders in the DSM, but there are also hundreds of other conditions that are non-mental disorders. Things like V-codes, Z-codes, T-codes, G-codes various things that are just considered life concerns. Academic problem is a Z-code, relational problem with a partner or parents-sibling relational problems these are Z-codes, phase of life problem, if someone in entering retirement, could be of a Z-code. These are things that people struggle with that they might seek assistance or support for, but they're not necessarily mental disorders. So, we have to determine then, does someone actually have a mental disorder diagnosis or another diagnosis. One thing is for sure though, you will virtually always have to make a diagnosis, after the first session or two, depending on what setting it is. Some places that are very generous might give you three sessions, but generally there are one or two. You do not have to make a mental disorder diagnosis though, but you have to make a diagnosis because that is what is documented as the reason for the visit. Okay. More aspects of the diagnostic assessment process that are important are that, it helps to justify the level of care, so you might know that there is outpatient counseling, which is the vast majority of services that mental health providers give. But there is also intensive outpatient counseling more than one day a week, there is partial hospitalization which usually includes most days a week for several hours a day, then there is residential treatment where it's in a residential setting, but it's also a treatment environment with mental health professionals and then there is of course inpatient treatment. So, the diagnosis does not ultimately determine what level of care someone is triaged to or referred to, but it can help, it can help. Again, in terms of prognosis, if someone has something that's generally short term and mild like what's called an adjustment disorder, that would almost never indicate something like partial hospitalization, residential treatment or inpatient treatment. Someone who has some a condition that might be more severe and more pervasive like schizophrenia might at times necessitate some higher level or more invasive type of treatment to stabilize the symptoms. So, that is part of assessment process. And then, ultimately, assessment is something that you should continue to do long after you narrow down and pinpoint that diagnosis, it's something you should do throughout the entire treatment process, because it helps provide this baseline for you to follow as a clinician and for the client to follow themselves. So, if someone comes in and you document the signs and the symptoms, the severity of those, the pervasiveness, how it affects the person's life, you can see if that changes for the better overtime as you're working with them. Very, very important. In my opinion, our goal as mental health professionals is not only to focus on signs and symptoms of mental disorders, but if someone does have a mental disorder and they have impairing signs and symptoms, that they're struggling with, it should be part of the treatment picture. And you should do your best to help work with them so they can recover from those. Now there is a process to this and this is not easy to do in practice, but in theory, you would generally warm-up slowly, follow up on some questions, then get a personal history, assess their mental status exam and then narrow down and try and pinpoint that diagnosis. Let's go through this piece-by-piece and you'll see how not only important is, but how important it is that it flows from one step to the next. The more fluid and smooth this process is, the more it won't feel like you're just playing 20 questions with your client. And they are almost not part of the process and I've had many, many clients tell me that. When they see a mental health professional, it's like they're sitting in the chair and theâ€¦ the counselor or social worker or psychologist or what have you, almost doesn't even know that they are there, they are just going down a checklist of signs and symptoms and they're just answering questions one after another, not knowing why. Not knowing where it will lead, well, that's really not the way to form a collaborative relationship, so you help the person learn what their suffering is and how to recover. This is the process that I would recommend using. First, the warm-up, it's vital to create a safe comfortable environment for the client. The warm-up process is generally about understanding their presenting issues. What are they struggling with right now? What are the things that we call in our field signs and symptoms that might lead to their distress or some kind of disability in their life? So, how do you provide a safe comfortable environment? Building rapport, being empathic, not being judgmental as they are talking about possibly seeing or hearing things that other people don't see or hear or different ways of viewing the world that seem odd or eccentric to you or being very, very anxious to the point, may be they can't even sit still in the room with you. It's being open and embracing to them, so they feel like you care, that's a very, very important, theyâ€¦ for them to feel like you're working with them and you're not doing an assessment on them, very, very different mindset. So, you help them feel safe, you help them feel comfortable in the room physically, emotionally, psychologically and then you start with broader open-ended questions. Now, generally speaking, most people will have a client questionnaire, that's already been filled out, it could be online or it could be paper and pen format that they fill out in a waiting room or some other format, but you'll usually have some information that will give you a starting point and then you really usually want to start with open-ended questions like, what do you feel is the most difficult part of your life to deal with right now? What are some of the things that your suffering with most, right now? Open-ended questions you might remember are things that you do not answer with a yes or no. What, how, when, so, you allow the person to tell their story. That's a very key part of the beginning assessment process. And even if it's not a question, you could still ask something broad that will help facilitate them self-disclosing more so you can understand their suffering like, "You know, you mentioned before that you were feeling really, really down and this has been effecting you for long time and it's been difficult to bare for you. Could you tell me a little bit more about what difficult to bare means for you?" That helps you understand their perspective and how it's impacting them. But, it's broad right, you leave the door open, so they could tell their story. That's the warm-up process. Then, in the funneling technique, you go one step more narrow and that's when you start following up. And this is where you ask more specific or closed-ended questions. And if you look how I mention that open-ended questions don't get answered by yes or no, while close-ended question do. So, closed-ended question might be, to the same example of depression, "You said that this has been going on for a long time, it's been very difficult for you, hard to bare. Hasâ€¦ Have these feelings of depression lasted more than two weeks? That's answered with a yes or no question. Now, the reason you might ask that question is, because the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder says it has to go on longer than two weeks. So, you start narrowing it down to rule in or out certain disorders. And you ask more specific questions that's part of the funneling process. So, part of what you're trying to do here is gather history of their presenting concerns. How long have the sign and symptoms being going on? What are the specific impairments or disabilities that are consequences of the signs and symptoms? Etcetera. Get a more detailed picture of this. And ideally this would flow from the warm-up process, not come out of the blue, that's very important. One builds on the other. After you feel and the client feels like they've had enough time to discuss the presenting concerns and give the picture of that, so you both are in the same page then the next step is what's called the personal history. Now, this can be very long, very detailed and frankly very tedious, but it doesn't have to be. I remember when I was learning in my mental health counseling program, and as an intern and as a new clinician, we had literally 15 to 20 pages of personal history information that we needed to gather and it took so long that it was exhausting for the client and myself. So, what I'm going to recommend to you unless you have a very standard kind of format that you have to complete is that you are a little more flexible with the historyâ€¦ personal history process. And you focus on the parts of the client's personal history that would relate most to the first two steps. So, let me explain what personal history is. First of all, part of personal history might be recent stressors in the client's life. Have there been anything recently that really impacted you that, that happened in your life that might relate to the things that we were discussing before about depression, any life changes, any extremely stressful events for you? You're not looking to see if something stressful happened to a client 10 years ago or you're not interested so much in where something stressful happening in a completely other area of your life, you know. I'm here for depression, because I just lost a significant other who passed away. Yes, Iâ€¦ I had, something stressful, I got a D on a mid-term exam in one of my classes, but that doesn't really relate to why I'm here. You're focused really on things that relate to the presenting concern to help you better understand that. The second part of personal history has to do with family history. Now, again, in my opinion, it's not important to go into a very, very long detailed developmental history of the person's entire family life. But, does anyone in their family suffer from the same kind or presenting concerns? Because some mental disorders have a genetic component, some have a lot of modeling involved, the social components. So, you want to know who else to close to the person might have impacted their signs and symptoms to either bringing them on quicker or make them more severe etcetera. So, for example, you talked about, you know, severe depression, difficult to deal with, this has been going on a long time, it's really affecting your ability to work, to relate to other people. Has anyone in your close family suffered from something similar? Your parents, siblings and allow the client to share that with you. And again if, both parents have recently suffered from the same thing or both siblings especially if it's, for example, an identical twin, monozygotic twin, that would make it more likely that this could impact the client themselves. Then personal relationships, friends or significant others have the presenting concerns that the client is suffering from and helping to recover from, impacted their relationships with their friends or partners orâ€¦ or any intimate relationships. This is very, very important to know, because it tells you again about the severity and pervasiveness, but it also potentially could tell about the prognosis, because the more it's impacting their friendships and their intimate relationships possibly the less support they'll have, there is any number ofâ€¦ of consequences to that. So, you would want to ask somebody that. Also, does it affect their work or school depending on where they are out in life? Does it impact their ability to do well academically or to perform at work or rather is it causing them to drop out of school? Or is it causing them to miss work extensively and perhaps even be reprimanded for it. I've had clients that that's happened to. This is understanding the client, but also knowing the bigger picture, so you could work with them to focus on what's most important or most impactful at this point. And something that I personally include in the personal history is, a history of treatment. I think that's important. Some people may not put it in this part of the assessment process, but I think a prior history of mental healthcare is important to know, especially, if it's for the same kind of concern, because again the more often something recurs usually the worst the prognosis is and it tell you a lot about how to work with the person. After you do this personal history, so you even get a much more comprehensive picture, then you got to something much more technical and it's called the mental status exam. The more medical, a healthcare professional is, the more likely they will do a more complete mental status exam. The more medical, a mental health professional is the more likely a fuller mental health, mental status exam will be completed. So, what is a mental status exam? Well, it'sâ€¦ and now I guess, in physical healthcare to a physical exam and what is a physical exam, it's broad, right. You go in for a checkup and what happens in a physical exam? They take your weight, they usually take your temperature, right. They usually check your reflexes, broad things to find out if there's any gross abnormalities orâ€¦ or issues. That's really what a mental status exam is geared towards. Any gross psychological or social orâ€¦ or biological issues and again in my opinion related to the presenting concerns, because your time isâ€¦ is very limited in the assessment process. So, some examples of what's included within the mental status exam are appearance. If a client comes in and they are very disheveled, dirty, uncapped, it could be a socio-economic issue, which is something you'd have to rule out, but it could also tell you if it's something related to a mental health concern, like, for example, some psychotic disorders, where clients often lose the ability to maintain adult daily living skills, personal hygiene, one example. So, appearance is just something that youâ€¦ you would assess. Speech is another thing that you could assess. Is their speech normal pace, normal tone, normal volume or one example, are they speaking extremely rapidly to the point that you can't even understand what they are saying and they won't stop talking then they just keeping going on and on and on and on, you're trying to answer question, but they won't even answer your questions, because you keep etcetera. That could potentially be an indication of either severe anxiety or possibly even manic like symptoms. If there is other behavioral systems attached to that. So, you want to look at the tone, the volume, the rate of their speech, see if it's within a typical range. And then, a key component of the mental statics exam is what's called cognitive functions. And these have do with memory, orientation, which relates to person, place, time and situation, meaning are they aware of who you are, as a mental health professional and who they are. Are they aware of where they are in for example an outpatient counseling setting? Are they aware of the date and the year, the time? Okay, and then are they aware of why they are there, the situation? Generally, the cognitive functions, if there's any gross abnormalities, there might potentially indicate a cognitive disorder, delirium, dementia, something like that, possibly substance intoxication also. So, again you are looking forâ€¦ for gross abnormalities. After you do that, which again, I recommend only focusing on the things that you have yellow flags for, rather than going through all of the detailed assessment parts of every mental status exam component, which could take half of a session right there, look for gross abnormalities and once you have ruled those out, then you could start focusing a little more on diagnostic follow up. This is theâ€¦ the most focused part of that funnel. The narrowest part that you're trying to get to in the assessment process. So, you understand why they came in, you've build a rapport with them, they feel safe and comfortable, you followed up on some questions, so you really try to narrow things down andâ€¦ and understand more specifically and then you've discussed with them how it's affecting different parts of their life. And you've ruled out if there's anything major biologically or psychologically or emotionally that you must focus on in-depth, then you could get to the actually DSM-5. And we'll talk a little bit more about how to do that. Because there's 20 different chapters of mental disorders in the DSM-5 and literally 100s of diagnosis. But this will lead you at least to opening the DSM-5 and trying to pinpoint something specific that you could code and record for the treatment process and the record, and billing third parties, very important. The reason I said that we will come back to discussing exactly how to do that DSM diagnostic process is, because first, before you open the DSM and start looking at disorders and people forget this, you first have to determine if back to the beginning, if there is a mental disorder at all? And most people forget that there's actually a definition for mental disorder. And they just immediately flip to different parts of the DSM and start rattling off questions related to symptoms, but they haven't even determined if there's a mental disorder present. So, this is the main parts of the definition of the mental disorder from DSM-5, which is a syndrome that's a collection of signs and symptoms, that is characterized by clinically significant disturbance. In the individual, you cannot diagnose a couple or a family or a group just like physical healthcare, you must diagnose one individual, that's the way our healthcare system is setup. So, you're looking for a collection signs and symptoms that are clinically significant disturbance in one individual that is the primary client or patient. So, how do you know if a disturbance is clinically significant? 

00:32:35

00:32:40
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ I don't have the answer either. The truth is, that it's up to you. You as a clinician have to determine if something has a severe and a pervasive enough to warrant a mental disorder diagnosis and keep in mind, when you diagnose the mental disorder you're actually diagnosing a medical condition. So, if you think that something is clinically significant, it should cause problems in a person's thinking emotions or behaviors, it should be dysfunctional for the person or maladaptive. And it should be associated with significant distress or disability. And to me the bottom two lines here really help you determine if something is clinically significant or not. Does it cause significant personal distress for your client or some concrete disability in their life, work, school, etcetera. Now before you open the DSM to specific disorders, you really need to document how they need this definition, that's how you cover yourself and that's how you provide for the record for future clinicians or courts or insurance companies or anything else. Why is it clinically significant and what is the distress or disability that leads you to think that way? This is very, very important. If you think that it does meet the definition of the mental disorder, then you will start narrowing that down to something highly, highly specific if possible. Now here's a hierarchy of certainty with diagnosis. So, the higher up on this slide, the more certain you are as a clinician about what the diagnosis is. So, if you decide someone does have a mental disorder, then you're next job is to open the DSM and try and figure out which category of mental disorder it is out of the 20 chapters. So, a category or chapter is psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, neuro-cognitive disorders, there are 20 of them. You should try to first figure out the category and then literally review the criteria for each separate disorder. I cannot tell you how many times clinicians believe, Iâ€¦ I know what major depressive disorder is, but if I were to actually ask them to tell me what the criteria are? How long you have to have the symptoms, etcetera? They routinely fail, because you are just getting this routine of almost informally understanding what that is and then you risk being inaccurate and miss-diagnosing the client. So, you find the category, then you read again each specific disorder criteria and then you come up with a diagnosis or more. How many diagnosis can a person have? Mental disorder diagnosis, how many physical health diagnoses can you have? Any number, any number. You should diagnose whatever conditions the person is currently suffering from. If you have more than one, you are technically supposed to write next to the primary one, that they are coming in for treatment for principal diagnosis, if its inpatient or reason for visit if its outpatient. Now most people don't do that to be honest with you, most people just list them and the top disorder, on the list is the primary one. And that's generally how insurance companies and Medicaid and other funding sources will view more than one diagnosis, the top one is the presenting concern that you are primarily focused on in the treatment process, not that you can't focus on the others as well. So, you can add specifiers to that, like, severity, mild, moderate, severe and various other things that you could read about on page 22 to 23 of DSM-5. But the main point is, you try to make a diagnosis or list, the most important, primary one at the top. If you're not 100% sure, but you are 90% sure that it meets criteria for a specific disorder, major depressive disorder, for example, you could put the code and the name, but then in parenthesis right provisional, that tells everyone that I'm making the diagnosis, but I'm going to follow up again over the next session or two, because I'm not 100% on it. If you are even less certain than that and you can't even find a specific code, you can diagnose what's called unspecified or other specified. Every single category of mental disorders has unspecified diagnosis that are very wide open and flexible for you. Depressive disorder, unspecified, that means I know that they meet the definition of a mental disorder, if you remember that. And I know that it's specifically related to depression, but it's not major depressive disorder or (inaudible ) disorder, output depressive disorder, unspecified, perfectly acceptable almost always perfectly reimbursable by third parties, it just gives you the broad window, you're almost diagnosing a category in a sense versus one specific disorder. Other specified is a little bit more specific and personally I don't recommend using that, because it's basically saying that you don't meet the criteria for any other disorder in that category, but you do know what it is and then you have to describe what it is and itsâ€¦ its challenging especially for neuro-clinicians, I would recommend sticking with unspecified and it gives you a lot of flexibility. You will not see in the DSM "rule out", but it's something you will see in practice in the field. "Rule out" is a more informal way to just document that I'm not sure if they have this disorder or not. So, actually you're ruling it in or out either way, but often you'll just see R/O rule out schizophrenia. Now, generally, what happens is, you would only rule out something that is more severe than the thing you're diagnosing or completely different. So, for example, if you have brief psychotic disorder, which is a short-term mild form of psychosis, you might rule out schizophrenia form disorder or schizophrenia a longer more severe kind. So, you diagnose brief psychotic disorder, but you rule out that it's a more severe form that you will continue to access for, but I'm not diagnosing it yet. It doesn't make sense to have a rule out something less severe, you can't diagnose schizophrenia and rule out brief psychotic disorder, because one already trump the other, see. And if it's none of these, if it's no mental disorder at all, that's when you go to Z-codes or T-codes or G-codes, which are just life concerns. So, you start with the most severe, specific kinds of diagnosis and you go down the ladder, until you reach a diagnosis that's not a mental disorder at all. And then, to be sure, you always rule out a substance induced condition or medical condition that's causing the symptoms and signs, very, very important. You have to ask the client about substance use and about if they've had any recent physical illnesses or changes in their health status, to ensure that whatever's happening up here is not caused by something external. As, general points throughout this process, I would just recommend that you keep all of these key elements in mind, because this will help do what we talked about in the very beginning, which is make the process smooth, comfortable for the client and effective for you. So, you gather the information you need to make an evidence based diagnosis. You stay calm, you stay emphatic, go slow, patience is the key here. It's difficult to find that balance. When you have a lot of pressure to make a diagnosis during the first session or two. But patience is key because the stakes are high. You do not want to rush the process to the point that you just jump to a conclusion and miss-diagnose somebody with a mental disorder that could impact their sense of self andâ€¦ and their relationships with other people, their work life anything. So, be patient, look at signs as well as symptoms and connect with the client, that's what avoid excessive note taking means. Often clinicians are so focused on getting the data, data, data, that I've seen people not even look at the client, they're actually sitting here sometimes with a legal pad that you have to look over to even make sure the client still on the room and then they are back down, they are writing notes, writing notes, asking questions. Ideally, you would want to put the data gathering aside and focus on what the client is telling you, so you could continue to use empathy and be genuine and keep that connection with them, so they know that you care. That's the way to have honest, open self-disclosure from them and for you to support them as a client. Of course, you would not want to make judgments as they are telling you things, because you never know what a client's going to report, but one thing is for sure, guaranteed, they are going to have different experiences than you. And they might seem strange, they might seem odd, but your goal as a clinician is not to judge whether something is deviant or different, your job is to try and understand if they have extreme personal stress or disability from a mental condition they're suffering with, that's very different. So, being open and available to them going with their story to understand them better and most importantly in my book is explaining to them what you're doing as you're doing it. Again, back to the beginning, the hope is that you're not doing an assessment on somebody, but you're learning about their suffering with them. That way, as you're assessing, they can actually learn about themselves at the same time and then it could help them in their own recovery, very, very important. So, I hope you can see how if you follow this process of effective interviewing and you follow the assessment stages, it can lead to a very smooth, very collaborative and hopefully very effective assessment that could lead to an accurate DSM diagnosis. Why don't we open it up for questions and we could see what you would like to know a little bit more about? 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN I was wondering if you had any questions that you always, always would ask the client? 

00:46:00
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ I'm glad you asked that because although this is very individual to each clinician and it should be tailored to the client to their readiness to self-disclose, to their readiness for change, I think it's important to ask a few questions for every client, one is how distressing do you feel that this is in your life at this time on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being unbearable, unmanageable and 1 meaning, I got this. I think I can cope with it. I'mâ€¦ I'm doing fine, even though it's a concern of mind. I'd like to know, where the client falls on that. I'd also like to know in a similar way, how much they feel that it's impacting their functioning, in their life, their ability to live, to love and to work. Then again may be on a 1 to 10 scale. A third question that I usually ask is how's thatâ€¦ number that they have given about the level of distress that they have experienced or the amount ofâ€¦ of impairment that its caused changed recently over the last few weeks or month or two. Because I'd like to know if that has gotten worse or better or stays the same. These are very important to gauge where the client it is that, in terms of prognosis and in terms of the definition of the mental disorder, but also their own insight into the process. Are there any other questions? 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN Yes. Earlier you mentioned the various codes. Ummâ€¦ Could you expand a little bit more on the differences? 

00:47:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Sure. Well, you know we talked about the complexity of coding different diagnosis and the way that the system works is, starting in 2015, when America uses the International Classification of Diseases â€“ Clinical Modification version, the ICD-CM, there is a chapter in that of F-codes, it is a chapter of mental disorder diagnosis and all of the diagnosis start with the letter F. And then they have numbers after it. So, if you are diagnosing a mental disorder, you are diagnosing an F-code. In contrast, there are other chapters, that are Z, or T or G-codes, sometimes even what's V-codes that used to be the most common and previous versions of the DSM and the ICD-CM. Each of these different chapters is a different title and it's a different group of symptoms and signs or a different types of illnesses and they are very broad. For example, Z-codes are not mental disorders because they are not F-codes, but they are contact with health services and it could be anything related to seeking services to experiencing difficulty with the life transition or requiring out-patient counseling orâ€¦ or things like that. Then you have a separate chapter called T-codes that have to do with injury or poisoning or some other conditions. A lot of these are physical conditions that you would not diagnose as a mental health professional, but there are psychological and social conditions within those chapters as well. Ans the same thing with the G-codes, nervous system conditions. It might have to with memory or might have to do with other things that might relate to a mental health concern, but no Z, T, G or V-code is a mental disorder, because it's not an F-code, it's not in the mental disorder category. So, it doesn't rise to that level of severity or pervasiveness that a mental disorder needs to be at, to be clinically significant. So, that's part of the assessment and diagnosis is figuring out whether something is a mental disorder or not, and anything above this line where it describes the different letter codes would be and F-code. If it's not and F-code, you have many, many choices in other chapters of the diagnosis manuals to choose from. Are there any other last questions? Okay well, remember as you are moving through this process it will be difficult because you are working with another human being who isâ€¦ is suffering. It may be hard for them to share everything about signs and symptoms because they don't have the technical language to do that and they are in distress. They are there for support, they are there for guidance, they are there for compassion and they are there to figure out how to recover from a healthcare professional who is a mental health professional. The key is to be sensitive, patient, open-minded and to go through the process smoothly and consciously, so you can help the client become collaborative within that process as well. Thank you.
