DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Hi, my name is Doctor Manivong J. Ratts and I am Associate Professor in the Department of Counseling and School Psychology at Seattle University. Today what you're going to be doing is watching a video series titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy. We're going to be going over the major theoretical paradigms, if you will, or forces that have really shaped uh, how counseling is practiced with clients. We're going to look at the first force, which is the psychoanalytic tradition, the second force, which is also referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition in counseling and psychotherapy. Then we'll highlight and provide an overview of the third force in counseling, which is the existential/ humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology. Then we'll look at the fourth force in counseling, which is referred to as the multicultural paradigm in the field. And then last but not least, we'll examine and look at social justice as the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. Within each of these particular theories or paradigms or forces, if you will, I'll be interviewing experts in the field. Each of these experts will be sharing and talking about their current research within that particular paradigm as well as some of the major tenets of the particular force that uh, they are specializing in in the particular field. So I'll be interviewing uh, a psychoanalytic uh, scholar. I'll be interviewing a CBT scholar, existential scholar, uh, multicultural oriented scholar, and then last but not least, a social justice oriented scholar who've really helped shape each of those particular forces and made them what they are today. Following each of those particular interviews, uh, what you'll see is a series of therapy sessions with the same client. The client will be working with five different therapists. Each therapist will be operating from a particular tradition, paradigm or force, if you will. The first therapist will be operating from a psychoanalytic tradition. The second therapist will be working from a CBT perspective, a cognitive/behavioral uh, orientation. The third therapist will be operating from a existential/humanistic perspective in counseling. The fourth therapist will be working from a multicultural oriented perspective. And then the last but not least, we have a demonstration of the therapist working from a social justice oriented perspective. My hope is that by watching each of these particular videos, uh, or interviews, if you will, as well as each of these particular counseling sessions, it will really highlight and provide you with some of the strengths and weaknesses of each particular counseling force that have really shaped counseling as practiced to this day.

DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Today what you're going to be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy. The first interview will be taking place with Doctor Cirecie West-Olatunji and Doctor Allen Ivey. Both are experts in the multicultural uhm, movement in counseling and psychotherapy. The second interview that you'll be able to watch is an interview with Doctor Patricia Arredondo and Doctor Thomas Parham. Again, multicultural scholars who've really helped shape the multicultural counseling perspective uh, into what it is today. In each of these particular interviews, uh, we'll be highlighting some of the major historical events as well as figures who helped shape the multicultural perspective to what it is today. Each interviewee will also have an opportunity to highlight some of the major tenets of the multicultural perspective as well as discuss uh, some of the major research that's happening now that is impacting the field of multicultural counseling. Following both of these particular interviews, uh, you'll have an opportunity to watch a live demonstration of a counseling session with uh, Doctor Agnes Kwong, who's a psychologist at the University of Washington. And what Doctor Kwong will be doing is working with a particular client uh, and uh, from a multicultural perspective. And so, within this particular uh, uh, clinical session, you'll have an opportunity to sort of see how she operationalizes multiculturalism with this particular client. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy, where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling uh, as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition, which is the first force in counseling. The second force is referred to as a cognitive/behavioral tradition, the third being the existential/humanistic tradition, the fourth the multicultural counseling paradigm, and last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy.

4th Force: The Multicultural Paradigm Interviews First Interview Cirecie West-Olatunji, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of Florida Allen E. Ivey, Ed.D., Professor Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Amherst 

00:05:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS I am here with Doctor Allen Ivey and Doctor Cirecie West-Olatunji, and what we're going to be doing today is talking about multiculturalism as the fourth force in counseling. And I'm pretty excited to interview the both of you because you've been uh, really the movers and shakers of helping to forge the movement and, and sort of take it to a different level in terms of how do you incorporate multiculturalism uh, in counseling and psychotherapy. Uhm, so I'm going to ask you a series of questions and so you can, in, in the hopes that you can elaborate a little more in terms of what multicultural counseling is uh, and how do you operationalize it with students, or I mean with clients in, in counseling and, and psychotherapy. Uh, one of the first questions I wanted to ask was what got you involved in the multicultural counseling movement? How did that begin for you? 

00:06:20
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY I guess I would say for me, just personally as a child, experiencing a-, I mean I'm white, but I experienced an immense amount of oppression in a rural elementary school in Mount Vernon, Washington (inaudible ). And my father ran a small grocery store. And every day I went to school I'd be called the K word or Jew boy or something like that day after day. And then the parents would come to the store. I'd have to smile. And I didn't really talk to anybody that really understood me until I was counseling at Boston University. And I said, 55]hey these Jewish kids from New York had an experience like mine. So that basically kind of results in kind of an underlying passion for the movement. How'd I get into it? Uh, that's another story, but I think I'll pass it on to you. 

00:07:05
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Well, that's very interesting to hear that. Of course my life has had a similar kind of trajectory of, uh, being marginalized uh, in a lot of different ways. And in the education realm I think it's probably the largest uhm, body of experiences for me. Uh, but where I came into multicultural counseling. Uh, I remember working in higher education. I was working at a medical school. And I was wondering, uhm, why are all these bright students having difficulty getting through the medical, medical school curriculum. And I noticed they were, there were all non-traditional in some kind of way. Uhm, the school uh, was very open to a diverse population of students, so they were interested in students who were not only the traditional pre-med students, but also students who were uh, world renowned ballerinas, or uhm, were musicians. But also they had uhm, orthodox Jews. They also had uh, ethnic, diverse, ethnically diverse students, and I noticed that it was that group of non-traditional students who were struggling in the curriculum. And I didn't know anything about uh, the field of counseling at all. But I wondered, what is it about this demographic of not being conventional that created this disconnect for these students who, on paper, should have been doing very well. And I discovered a program at a nearby university uh, that had a concentration in multicultural counseling, took my first course and fell in love with counseling as a discipline. And then also gained some understanding and some answers, some knowledge about what it means to be marginalized, what it has to do with our ability to function, uhm, and how it can compromise our emotional and psychological health. So that's how I came into it. 

00:09:00
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So it sounds like for the both of you, it's really been your personal experiences that got you involved in, in the multicultural movement. And in a sense, happenstance a little bit in terms of recognizing unfairness and trying to figure out what that all means, for the both of you. When you think about the movement, if you will, sort of if your experiences, how did it evolve, multicultural counseling as a paradigm, as a fourth force in counseling and psychology? 

00:09:30
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY You know, that's something that I haven't really-, and I think is terribly, terribly important, because it's Africans and African-Americans that really formed the foundation of the whole multicultural movement, which means we go back to Steve Biko in South Africa dealing with apartheid. Martin Luther King uh, and they sort of-, and Desmond Tutu, sort of formed this, basically the moral foundation for getting us into counseling. And so I just say that's it's really important to say that. And the early people that were involved in this, Charles Thomas, the first cultural identity theory. And then Bill Cross comes along, identifies more precisely. And then a whole raft of people follow from that. The women's movement evolved from that. The gay pride movement evolved from that. The disability movement. All of that stuff, I think, came from, from my perspective, those key people. How would you react to that? 

00:10:25
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI I would agree with that. Uhm, I would also say that I probably enter into this with uh, more of a historiography of uhm, what it's been to be of African descent uh, in, in the U.S. So actually, I would go back to uh, early psychology in the United States where, you know, what I think about it the term drapetomania. And this was a term that was used for enslaved Africans who were running away. 

00:10:50
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:10:55
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI You know? So that was a psychological term for people who were running to freedom that was a pathology. So you have these early scholars who build on that understanding- 

00:11:05
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY That they be devoid- 

00:11:05
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. Absolutely. That uh, people who are different are being pathologized. 

00:11:10
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yes. 

00:11:10
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI For thinking very correctly, for having their heads on straight. So it's that, I think, that fuels this whole movement that says that we really do need to think about multiple realities, and that if we look from a different lens, that we would conceptualize people differently and have a different kind of understanding of what the behavior would look like and what the etiology would be for anything. So I would add to that, that you know, perhaps we could go back even further, to say that uhm, there were people who were resisting- 

00:11:45
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Oh yes. 

00:11:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI That kind of hegemony, the cultural hegemony, even earlier. 

00:11:50
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Oh right. It goes back into, and you can go back for centuries, if you want to go into African history. It's incredible. 

00:11:55
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. Yeah. 

00:12:00
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Incredible. Uh, in terms of getting into counseling, I guess for me it becomes Bill Cross, uh, and his cultural identity theory, which is kind of the foundation for this. Would you agree with that? 

00:12:10
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. 

00:12:10
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And then- 

00:12:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Can you say more about that? Because his work and, and how (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Okay, well basically, we'll work together on this, okay? Basically, I wish Bill were here. I feel like I'm in an exam now. But, but basically, there is sort of a naive stage, you're not aware that you are a cultural being. And uh, basically you kind of, this is the way things are. And uh, an African American or a gay person would, a gay person would stay in the closet. A disabled person would say well, that's the way the society is. I just have to accept it. And they don't do anything healthy. So it's basically what they might call a naive stage. And then along comes encounter stage. And what happens at the encounter stage? 

00:12:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI They begin to have some dissonance of course, because they experience things that they don't understand. So, uh, an example that's been given to me in my training is uh, perhaps uhm, a young man who thinks that anyone can join a fraternity, for example, on a campus. And they think well, there isn't that kind of discrimination. I think anyone can get ahead. And they apply to go into a fraternity, and they're not accepted. And they might apply again, and they're not accepted. 

00:13:25
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And they begin to realize that really it is unfair. It's not me. It's the system. 

00:13:30
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. Exactly. 

00:13:30
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY So out of this can-, often comes the emotion of anger. And we, we heard the phrase, Black Pride, so forth, uh, Gay Pride. I remember in Northampton, Massachusetts, which is a strong lesbian community, as a white male walking down the street at one point was very uncomfortable me. It's all because, there'd be a-, uh, they have a large lesbian population. They saw a white male and sometimes they'd actually directly confront me in the street, even though I didn't know them. A lot of anger and frustration. But interesting enough, another stage appeared in Northampton. And I think it's what, which I would call, I think it's called, what I would call a reflective period, where the lesbian community suddenly disappeared. And they got together in their own consciousness raising groups. How do we want to be in Northampton? The veterans in the Vietnam War did kind of the same thing. But black consciousness raising groups is the model. 

00:14:25
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. 

00:14:30
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And the other people adapted what originally came from black consciousness. 

00:14:30
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. And I think, if I understand uh, you know, what, what Doctor Cross has done is that he's presented us with this idea that uhm, these developmental stages are necessary for us to reach uh, this crystallizing identity, where we can discern better that we're, we're better, we're not using uh, these very static uh, demographics to be able to define uh, what alliances we have. Instead, we look inside. We look at people's values. so this idea of sort of going into a cocoon and learning about oneself, increasing knowledge about one's reference group, uh, is necessary. So we need to go through that stage where uh, we really surround ourselves with these like-minded people. But eventually, as we move through that we begin to think in more gray areas. So in the example of the young man who would apply for uhm, to go into a fraternity, would pledge a fraternity and would then perhaps decide that they have this very strong black identity, would refute all their white friends, everybody, just categorically, you know, as like we're not going to engage in our interactions with whites. 

00:15:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Kind of dichotomous type thinking. 

00:15:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Well, yes because they need to go into this cocoon to really appreciate. There, there has to be a mechanism to reject these negative uh, negative externally driven views of one's reference group. 

00:16:05
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY In order to understand your own group more fully. 

00:16:05
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. So there, there has to be that stage. But that same young man might begin to realize that his best friend is his this uh, you know, white young man whom he grew up with. 

00:16:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. 

00:16:20
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Forever. And that this person really cares about him and uh, perhaps can be uh, a supporter or can be uh, someone who in an alliance for him. And uh, and so he needs to begin to think about that. Well, maybe I don't want to throw away that friendship. Maybe that's a very deep friendship. So I need to make space for that somewhere. So there is this second stage of confusion where they emerge out of uh, this cocoon and begin to see things more clearly to say, well, it's not categorical. Well, maybe some white people really can be friends and understand what I'm going through. And then that's, there they have the potential to move into this synergistic stage where they can make decisions about uh, their friendships and their compatriots based on more deeper values. Would that be-? 

00:17:15
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:17:15
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI You something like that? 

00:17:20
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Uh, the integration, I think that's a marvelous summary. And, and for practical purposes in the counseling movement, what it-, each different style of awareness needs a unique approach to counseling. Now this is one of the great approaches in multicultural counseling. We do individual counseling and we do this exact theory in this particular way. Multicultural counseling says hey, it's a little more complex than that folks. 

00:17:45
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI That's right. 

00:17:45
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY A little more complex than that. And if you're a person that coming with a more naive consciousness, the goal really is to help them become aware of who they are, because they don't have a sense of identity. And if they're dealing with anger, you're going to have to support them, because I, as a white person, they won't even, probably won't even want to talk to me. I might be, as a white person, I'd work them reflectively. Each level of consciousness needs a different style. And different theories in the, in the, well, it's the good old theory books, will be helpful at different stages. But don't, those people want to say, this is the theory I'm going to use. I think it's probably a very dangerous thing. 

00:18:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. Well it sounds like in a, if I can summarize what you're sharing is, the multicultural counseling movement has really provided a framework to understand culturally diverse clients in a different way, in a way that doesn't necessarily pathologize clients, but in a way that helps us understand their experience from a different lens, from a different world view, to see how issues of equity and fairness, uh, impact people psychologically. And it sounds like what you're both also saying is what's happened in the field of counseling and psychology has really been a microcosm of what's happening in society in terms of the civil rights movement, the gay and lesbian movements, the disabilities movement. It sort of evolved and influenced the counseling profession, and, and, it has forced the profession of counseling and psychology to sort of look at themselves and look at are we being inclusive uh, in providing uh, multiculturally competent services. 

00:19:20
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And Rong (ph), it also kicks back another way. And we haven't paid enough attention to this. Counseling itself is the evolution of consciousness. This point has not really been realized. And you get a person who comes in. They basically, many of our clients come in with a naive level of consciousness about the nature of the problem, depression, anxiety, you name it. And they think it's their fault. And that's a naive consciousness. A lot of therapists and theories will reinforce that naive consciousness and keep them coming for therapy. So the issue here is the African American movement and the other ones that said there's, there's a person in social context Until you see yourself as a person in relationship to others, rather than as an individual, I mean this is a very linear individual. You are, who you are connected to is equally important. And so it's been very helpful for me in terms of clients from all races, ethnicities, and so forth. And white folks, in particular, need to know, we too have a culture. 

00:20:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. It's really (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And we've had a lot of naive white folks that aren't aware they're white. 

00:20:25
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. 

00:20:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So multicultural counseling has really shifted the paradigm of how, how we can help people- 

00:20:30
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yes. 

00:20:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS From an interpsychic paradigm, looking internally at what's going on in terms of cognition, thoughts and feelings with a client, to really looking at clients in context of a larger environment and how does contextual factors, sociopolitical factors, influence what's going on internally. 

00:20:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI What's resonated for me is this word consciousness. And uhm, there's a term that's being used, a discussion of disconsciousness, and disconsciousness theory. And the idea that, this, of moving people from a disconsciousness to a consciousness. And that this idea of these external factors, of these contextual factors, really impeding people's ability to develop fully as human beings. So when you place it on a level of being fully human, that, that's what's wrong with racism, sexism, homophobia, is that it prevents us from being fully human. And it doesn't matter which side of that you're on, whether you're the person who is inadvertently even, perpetrating that or whether you're the person who's experiencing that marginalization. That it, it depletes us of those things that make us fully human. And so this idea of moving from disconsciousness to consciousness is something that's needed. That's why, when we look at the multicultural counseling literature, uh, we, we have this idea of awareness, one's own awareness, awareness of one's own story, of where one enters into the work that we do with our clients. Is that it's got to be beyond this cognitive intellectual level of well, I sort of understand these issues of poverty, or I understand intellectually about racism. But we have to be present in order to develop that therapeutic alliance to actually move people, you know through their developmental consciousness. We have to be aware of what are we bringing to the table? What's our story? Where did we enter into that? And so a lot of times students don't understand, well, what is my white supremacy have to do with being a good counselor? So what does that have to do with anything? But it's because you can't be present. You're not fully human until you deconstruct those racist aspects of your identity and reconstruct a cultural identity, one that's based on some substance and some humanity. Then we can move from disconciousness to a greater level of consciousness. 

00:23:00
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS A couple of things come up for me as as you both talk about this. One is, what happens when clients become conscious of their situation and context and gain that critical consciousness uhm, what's a therapist's role? And then the other sort of question that comes up is, what you're talking about doesn't sound very neutral, which in counseling and psychotherapy traditionally counselors have been trained to be neutral with their clients. And what you're talking about in terms of creating this consciousness is a little bit different. 

00:23:40
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Okay, and what I would say is, neutrality is naive consciousness. 

00:23:45
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. 

00:23:45
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Why do I say it's naive consciousness? Who wrote our theories? White males. Uh, and so we come of an individualistic helper/helpee therapist/patient relationship. And that really is a model, that is a power model, which is I think predominates throughout the counseling and therapy fields still. And the, the difference in the multicultural train you want to move more, I would argue that all counseling therapy needs to work much more on an egalitarian contextual view. It's that simple. It's the person in context and you are egalitarian working with, rather than on client. 

00:24:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah, what you're sort of saying is clients don't exist is a vacuum. And to really have a comprehensive understanding of what's going on, you need to look at the larger picture. 

00:24:35
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yes. 

00:24:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS What happens when clients become aware of their situation and context in the therapeutic realm? And how do counselors deal with that? Because I would imagine there's a lot of emotion involved from moving from something's wrong with me to well, maybe it's not me. 

00:24:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI I would imagine that they would move to action, you know, once they become aware. Then, you know, that's what critical consciousness says. That we move from this consciousness into action. So we've eliminated, you know we create these limit acts, so we become aware of what these limitations are that are externally driven. And then we move toward action. So, I mean that is the theory of critical consciousness. So I think we get out of the way and allow clients to do the work that they need to do. What I was going to add to the idea of you know, neutrality of you know, this myth of objectivity is that it's very similar to the discussion going on in research. The idea of objectivity and neutrality in conducting research. But, you know, similarly, a similar vein of people who are talking about different ways to conduct research, you know what we call emancipatory research. This idea that first of all, there is no objectivity. That every researcher has a position and that their position needs to be revealed and included in what's going on. So, you know, if that discussion's going on in research, then it certainly should be going on in counseling and psychotherapy. 

00:26:05
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And that's one of the things you need to do, is just, in terms of elementary practice. You need to be open to questions, to let them question you, particularly if there's a gender difference, a sexual orientation difference, a racial difference, it's particularly important to put it on the table rather than leaving an elephant that you never talk about. So that just needs, it very much needs to be brought to the front. In terms of action, uh, I honestly, I see veterans uh, returned war veterans as a particularly important cultural group, which we tend not to. But they went through the same process. They came back from uh, Vietnam, I remember working in the VA and my job was to find out who are the malingers. We didn't have the word post-traumatic stress. As I began to listen to these people, I said, hmm, who's crazy? The person that sent this fellow to the hospital? No, it's-, a really an incredible thing for me to move me from my consciousness (inaudible ). Then in terms of action, oh, I'm not sick. I've been dealing with this external situation. I better stop this blaming. But as-, and the veterans got together and like African Americans shared this, and then APA had to begin some five disorders. A logical response to an insane situation is a disorder? And of course, now what's going on in the VA is they're changing to post-traumatic stress reaction, which I like the term better, but you know what? That means that if they make it that, they don't have to give as many benefits to the soldiers. So it becomes an excuse. 

00:27:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So the multicultural counseling is really a push back against the medical model? It sounds like what you're talking about. You talked about some (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY But that's the-, I, I don't want to be anti-medical. There's lots of good medical stuff. But, and particularly keep in mind public health, prevention. I took a course, the best course I took at Stanford in my whole psych program, they're the best in the country, was in education in community, community, community education. And I suddenly said, what's all going on? And I followed this by a year in Denmark, and I realized, hey, this Stanford psychology department didn't get it. And for the most part, they still don't. Brilliant though they are, and the great research, they still don't get social context. 

00:28:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So sounds though what you're really talking about is the merging of the fields of biology, psychology and sociology. Counselors, psychologists and therapists really need to operate from a biopsychosocial perspective uh, and be more balanced in, in uh, looking at clients from each of those three lenses and, and using all three disciplines to really understand clients. 

00:28:45
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yeah, and out of this, I've become in the last six years very committed to neuroscience. And one of the reasons I got into neuroscience, I began to discover that if a child is, goes through hunger, oppression, abuse, lives in Detroit, experiences multiple traumas, there's a loss of gray matter in the brain which will stay there permanently. And thus, social justice becomes an important part of multicultural counseling. I know there's a separate program on that. But part of action is to-, one of the best things that happens to-, if you're working with a woman or an African American, one of the best things you can do is encourage them to go out and help others become conscious. Women take back the night. African Americans get involved in community change. Nothing healthier for a person's self-concept than helping somebody else. And that's the task of therapists, to encourage and help. And while we're doing this stuff, we ought be active ourselves. 

00:29:40
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI So the idea of thinking about what kinds of interventions that are being uh, promoted within multicultural counseling, we think about this very integrated holistic approach of moving beyond the 50 minutes sitting in session. Of being able to identify some pathology. Of thinking about more organic kinds of interventions, about using peer uh, sponsored interventions, about intervening within one's system. And the more we do that, the more likely we are to be successful in doing the work that we do. So we see a lot of work in which we're talking about traumatic stress. We haven't talked about that. And there's a whole body of literature that's about a decade old now in talking about traumatic stress. And it's really talking about uhm, looking at pervasive systemic acts of marginalization and oppression and the impact that is has on our system in a holistic way. So we know that it's not enough just to look at the psychological or the emotional, but also to take a look at the biological. But at the same time, we're also looking at coping and human beings' ability to cope. And so there's a lot of literature that's beginning to talk about how are people who should have either gone crazy or be dead, how are they resilient? How are these communities- 

00:31:10
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Resiliency. 

00:31:10
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Resilient. Absolutely. And so we, as counselors, we need to use this, this body of knowledge and advance it so that we begin to understand not only what's happening, to look at the phenomenon, but also to look at the exceptions to that and to begin to question and be curious about (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY What are their strengths? 

00:31:30
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Exactly. Exactly. And I think that that's you know, part of the multicultural counseling movement. 

00:31:35
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And Cirecie, I want to go back to something you mentioned a couple times earlier on, and that's story and storytelling. What we're really doing in multicultural counseling, I think, from one perspective, and I think it's an accurate one too, is we're taking a story which isn't very effective and we're working on re-storying. We're changing the narrative. 

00:31:55
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. 

00:31:55
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And so narrative therapy becomes particularly useful. But then you need relationships and some of the Rogerian concepts to come into this. So, but I think the storytelling thing is particularly telling and important as a strategy to work on. Basically, a person who has a story, then you've got issues of life meaning, uh, as a whole. Multiple things. In that sense we draw from all different theories. But we're looking always at person and context, considering oppression. 

00:32:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So you talked about some pretty key concepts. Uh, I hear you talking about counselors and psychologists and therapists needing to understand clients in the context of their environment. The notion of creating, helping to create critical consciousness. Looking at how issues of equity and oppression are influencing mental health issues, uh, as well as cultural identity and crosses cultural identity development model. I'm wondering what are other key concepts that are important within the multicultural counseling course? 

00:33:00
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY I could take a first shot at that if you don't mind. 

00:33:00
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Oh no. Go ahead. 

00:33:00
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And that is basically the multicultural competencies. And they provide a map of the key concepts. And I think that they really need to be, I like them, see, at the core of the total counseling curriculum. Uh, I was lucky enough to be President of Counseling Psychology in the APA in 1980, and my one thing I'm most proud of is I named Derald Wing Sue the head of a committee. His committee report was the multicultural competencies, the first edition. And 1980 to 2002, a lot of people, a couple hundred actually got involved before were implemented. And I think this awareness of yourself, awareness of the issues, the knowledge of what the things are, and then developing the skills, and then you get into the fine points of that, provide a very good framework for the concepts we've been talking about. What would you, uh, how would you take that? 

00:33:55
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI I would agree, really. I think that as we move forward, one of the challenges that we've had is merging practice with the theory. So, you know, one of the things that, you know, I constantly uh, talk to my students about in classes is that uhm, often times we don't really know what to do when we get in our offices and close the door. So we have an intellectual understanding of awareness, knowledge and skills. But we don't really know what to do differently. And part of that is because we haven't really provided a, a lot of demonstrations of what does that look like? And that involves practitioners. So it's very important for us as scholars to partner with practitioners, people who are doing the work day in, day out, who, for the most part, aren't writing these articles, aren't writing these books. But are in there doing the work. And I think they can tell us the nuances of what it's like to try to use culture-centered techniques in helping people to move from disconsciousness to consciousness. So I think as, as we think about what has provided the foundation for the work that we do, that we still need to articulate what does that look like in our offices. When no one else is looking, do we really understand how to enact multicultural competence uh, in working with our clients? So we really do need to find ways to demonstrate that. One of the things that I've been doing is creating a lot of immersion experiences for students and I do those locally as well as internationally, uh, to be able to help them to see what it looks like. So, you know, uhm, I think about a trip that we took in 2007. And uhm, we went to South Africa and Botswana. And in the suburbs of Johannesburg, we were providing professional development with outreach workers. And they were showing us what culture-centered interventions look like. And the students gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about the interventions, about how do you dance an intervention? So, how do you use non-talk therapy to move people along expediently with very little recidivism? So how do we access that in a way that really helps people. So it's important for us to go into environments where we are confronted with these other ways in which we can intervene without clients and to learn how to do that. So people need to first be told how to do it, and then get a demonstration of how it's done, and then have the opportunity to practice that with support. But I think that we need to begin to move forward with our understanding of the competencies and learn how to practice it. I think that's where we are today, of really doing it. And Patricia Arredondo has done that in talking about the Latino-centric competencies. And the work that she's doing now, she's partnering with practitioners. And she's writing books that give examples, so a recent graduate or even an experienced practitioner can open up uh, you know, that material, those resources, and see an intervention that is uniquely culture-centered, not an adaptation of a Western-oriented intervention, but one that draws from the world views of those people and think about using it with a client in your own context. 

00:37:40
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And another type of intervention, in getting in the neuroscience and really looking at the research. And by the way, the best research currently being done in the medical literature, not in the psychological literature, and that is stress management. And for example, uh, an African American has hypertension. You can give them meds or you can work with them on exercise, meditation, social relationships, sleep patterns, all of these things in stress management. Uh, there's multiculturalism, stress management, multicultural competencies, I think it's all you need for effective practice. But stress management has been undersold. Uh, stress management will produce all the more gray matter in the brain. Uh, they've shown with African Americans who are facing Alzheimer's that exercise will slow down the progress of Alzheimer's. And that's a functional magnetic resonance imaging. This is science. We now have a science who can validate multicultural counseling. And many, many times I'll find wonderful multicultural stuff in the medical literature more effective than our own work. 

00:38:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI I'd agree. 

00:38:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So it sounds like the field's really evolved from a theoretical abstract concept with the multicultural counseling competencies, which is really about how the world should be, how a therapist should operate to looking at the practicalities of it. How do you operationalize the competencies? How do you, as a therapist, bridge the gap between theory and practice, which is really what you've been involved with. Uh, uhm, in the field. And I like what you talked about earlier, which is not taking what, a theory that already exists and adapting it to a different population, but creating something completely different. Uh, moving beyond that, you know, that additive approach to helping where we take a theory, tweak it, but the core constructs of that theory sort of are the same. What, what you're saying is doing something, what both of you are saying is doing something completely different which is meeting clients where they're at essentially. 

00:39:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. 

00:39:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Versus having clients adapt to our way of knowing, our way of practicing. 

00:40:00
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. I often say that, you know when I first graduated and became licensed, that uhm, as long as my clients were white males, I was good to go. So I spent weeks getting my clients to learn how to be a good client. 

00:40:15
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. 

00:40:15
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Uh, vis a vis, what I had learned in my textbooks. And over time, my clients taught me to meet them where they are. So they taught me how to be a more effective counselor. But, you know, when I started, yeah, until they were on board with being a white male client, I couldn't do anything because I didn't understand them. I didn't understand what they were doing. So they had to follow me down that path uhm, in order for them to, to receive some assistance. But over time as I got better, I opened myself up to be vulnerable to that, to receive them. And they taught me a lot. So whether that client was uh, you know, uhm, a middle aged uh, white female who was struggling with maturing into a place where she's comfortable with how her life has evolved. Whether it's working with uh, a retiring priest who is searching for meaning and context, uh, moving into that. Whether it's working with a client who has experienced some kind of sexual trauma and is a 23 year old female college student. Whatever kind of client that was, that I decided what I need to do is find out who are they? And what does help or healing look like in their own context? And once I went there, I was much expedient. I was much more respectful. And I was transformed. So I grew as a person and a professional. 

00:41:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Sounds like for counselors they really need to be at a certain level to be able to critique themselves in a way. I wondering, I kind of want to switch gears a little bit. What are the benefits for counselors? 

00:42:05
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Reality comes to my mind. That's the benefit. 

00:42:10
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yeah. 

00:42:10
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY It's this is the way the world is. Let's face it and deal with it. And it's a world of interconnections. It's a world of difference. And let's start facing reality. I think that's what has to, has to be faced. And uh, if they-, and that's what it's done for me. And the thing is, I never stop learning. I think I've come to the top of the mountain, oh, no, Martin Luther King (inaudible ). Another mountain top to go. There's always something new for me to learn. 

00:42:35
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yeah. 

00:42:35
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Always something new. It's exciting. You can tell, for me. 

00:42:40
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI And for me. 

00:42:40
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY It's reality, I think is what it is. 

00:42:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS what's the challenge in operating from this paradigm? What challenges can counselors expect? 

00:42:50
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Well, I think maybe I, I think Elsa Arrayo (ph), a wonderful uh, Columbian graduate I had. She was the internship that's an example of the challenge you're going to have. Uh, a woman came to her in a clinic in Boston who was being abused and had no place to go that night. Elsa went out and found a place for her to stay. She came back and her supervisor berated her for being unprofessional. And that's one of the great challenges you have. And I think one of the challenges, one of the great challenges is the huge monolith that says that this is the way you shall do it. Another great challenge is DSM. and worse is DSM-5. And, by the way, NIMH is planning a brain-based system which for diagnosis would be both biosocial, in other words, they're going to look at-, the new model will be looking at developmental history as well as biological issues. And also that new model coming up probably in 10, 15 years, has specific treatment. DSM-5 slows down, wastes money and gets in the way. So that-, one of the great challenges is just the existing system. And then the challenges are racism, sexism, and inability to understand the disabled. You go down that whole list of -ism's. They're still there. 

00:44:15
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS As you talk about that, that just seems overwhelming for a therapist. 

00:44:20
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yes. 

00:44:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS And so, how do you-, what recommendations do you have to-, as-, especially for emerging counselors and therapists who really resonate with the multicultural movement and perspective, if you will, in terms of uh, what recommendations do you have in terms of, you know, to not get burned out? Because I would imagine uh, and not to get overwhelmed, because I would imagine is what you're describing a very, or can be very overwhelming. 

00:44:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Well, you know, there are a lot of metaphors that can help people who are just getting started. You know, one is the starfish story. You know, to understand that uhm, the idea of a man walking along on the beach and uh, is throwing the star-, picking up the starfish and throwing him back into the ocean. And someone comes along and says, What are you doing? And he says I'm throwing the starfish back into the ocean. And the person said, Do you know how many starfish are on this beach? You know, it's like, it's an impossible task. It's not going to make a difference. And the man looks and throws another starfish in and says, It matters to that one. So the idea is that we have to deal with it one piece at a time and not be overwhelmed by the huge task. But deal with it at this micro level to say, it'll matter with this client right here. It'll matter today. Now I can't account for tomorrow. But it will matter today. So I think that it's important to do that. I think one of the challenges that I would add to that is just our own growth about being honest and being authentic and coming to the table and being vulnerable. So I think that when we don't admit things to ourselves, when we understand that sometimes we can be the obstacle to change, that uh, we can impede the progress. So, you know, I like to talk about that as well. And I, I think we never reach this level where we're so competent, multiculturally, that we don't have those challenges with our clients. It doesn't matter what you know about the field that a client, each client brings a different challenge. And sometimes that challenge is related to our own growth and development. So I think that in, in being multiculturally competent, that sometimes the challenge is us and the work that we have to do with ourselves. And that never ends, so we can never be a card-carrying multiculturally competent counselor. And, you know, when someone challenges us on what we're saying we just pull out our card and say, Well, you can't challenge me on that because see, I'm a multiculturally competent counselor. That's not true. And oftentimes people will do that. They'll take a multicultural counseling course or they'll be with a particular scholar, that's another thing, and say well, you know, I studied under-, you know? So, but we never reach that end. We're always challenged. And we can never feel that uh, that, that we've arrived at some point. So I think we're, we are the challenge sometimes and that we need to do that work. So it's important for us to include that in the mix. 

00:47:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Because what you're saying is it starts with us. It's a lifelong process. It requires a lot of self-awareness. Awareness of external factors as well. It requires us to be vulnerable and okay with being uncomfortable and asking that question, talking about that elephant in the room, that can impede on the therapeutic relationship, that can contribute to that barrier. 

00:48:00
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY I would want to reinforce the starfish example. Don't expect to do it all. Uh, it's not the mistakes you make. It's the way you recover from mistakes and learn from them. Uh, there's also (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Being okay with not being perfect. 

00:48:20
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yeah. It's, it's too complex. I've been in this stuff uh, I did my first writing literally 46 years ago in multicultural counseling, before most of the people out were born. And yet, there's always something new and someplace else I find I've been wrong. 

00:48:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. 

00:48:35
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And there's always something to learn. Although there's the other piece, while we're striving there's the whole issue of burnout, which you mentioned. You've got to take care of yourself. And I-, this week, of course I always talk about the latest study I read, but this week I read a study about brain scans of physicians. And they say they had patients and physicians. And they had videotapes of, of a patient experiencing pain, and uh, a patient not experiencing pain. Uh, vast difference between the control subjects that were patients. They could-, their brains tightened up. The scan all lightened up. Uh, the physicians did what they call deregulated. And they were not impacted by that, which basically means it's both good and bad. It's good because if you see enough pain, you've got to distance yourself. But if you distance yourself too further, too far, and we've all seen physicians that are really good at deregulating their observation of pain, that they lose the empathy. And so there's that incredibly important balance. It's most important to care. And when you sense yourself deregulating uh, then I think it's time to step back and take a break, get supervision, find yourself. Because you're only going to do damage if you're too deregulated. 

00:50:00
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So I want to talk about future developments. Uhm, where do you see the multicultural counseling movement going in the future? Where's it headed? 

00:50:10
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY I think the first thing we see is it's just awesome how it's more and more predominating in literature. And uh, I can recall when I knew all the literature, literally I knew all the literature. By the way, I can remember when there wasn't any. And I knew all the literature. I knew different journals. Suddenly there's so many journals, so much going on, so much good stuff and I think you made a really good point when you pointed out that really, and you have too, Vong. It's really are moving much more into interdisciplinary issues. It's anthropology. It's sociology. And yet, we still remain counselors and there's that core, but to know what we're doing demands an incredible breadth of knowledge. And I think where we're going to go is a more broader awareness. The biosocial model, CACREP standards have changed to a more biosocial model. Uh, developmental model, these things, this is-, the developmental model particularly uh, I think we need to pay a lot more attention. I think stress management. I think uh, the issue of uh, signing up programs with them. I think these things are all in development. And the research we're seeing constantly. And just, a new Counseling Psychologist came out and the new AMCD journal full of new, new and good things. 

00:51:35
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI It's true. 

00:51:35
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Where there wasn't anything. It's, it's just amazing good stuff. It's going to become more and more central. 

00:51:40
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So it's really evolved to a point where the multicultural perspective is, is core to what we do as counselors. Core into our training programs that's, that's in the code of ethics. It's part of the CACREP accreditation requirements. Uh, the multicultural count it sounds like has, has had a major influence in terms of shifting the field. 

00:52:00
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yeah, I think how vastly it's changed. I remember when Michael D'Andrea, Patricia Arredondo, I think Derald Wing Sue, Thomas Parham and I were ready to picket at an Asus (ph) meeting because they wouldn't deal with the multicultural competence. We literally were threatening to break up the conference unless they did something. Uh, and that was only about 15, 20 years ago. So you can see how, how much things have changed in a fairly short time. 

00:52:30
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI And has given birth to that kind of change in other disciplines. 

00:52:30
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY I guess one of the things is advocacy and getting in people's face now and then. You're taking a risk. 

00:52:40
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS It's helped spurn the social justice movement. 

00:52:40
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:52:40
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. 

00:52:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS In a sense. 

00:52:45
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Yeah, the social justice movement came out of that. Counseling is not enough. 

00:52:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. 

00:52:50
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. I would add one other piece that uh, seems to be on the horizon. And that is the integration of multicultural counseling with sort of this international counseling movement. So as we, we see an emergence of counseling in other countries, and people are asking for assistance and consultation from the American Counseling Association and other counseling organizations, uh, as more multicultural counseling people become involved in that, they bring with them that expertise. And so with an exchange, with a true dialogue, what we're going to get is new kinds of definitions, new terms, as people in other contexts talk about what counseling looks like there. So, you know, one of the things I've heard Courtland and Lee talk about is that once we really begin a true conversation globally, about counseling and we're actually learning from other people, that what we do might not be the word counseling. That it might be some other word that more fully expresses the kinds of things that we do. And so we need to open ourselves up to a true global conversation about what healing looks like in all these different places. So we don't need to be the, you know, the true core of what counseling is. People have been resolving their problems for centuries well before Freud came along and provided us with our foundation in counseling and psychotherapy. So as we began to be more tolerant and open ourselves us to conversations with people in the Pacific Rim, with people in, on the continent of Africa, people in Eastern and Western Europe, and people in uh, the Americas outside of the U.S., that what we'll get are other definitions. We'll get these other things and so it'll become more diverse. We'll have a better understanding and we might learn something actually about how this work is done. So I would say that that's also on the horizon, that there is very much the potential to be able to integrate multicultural counseling as a movement in a global context. I think we need to be a part of that conversation uh, and I'm hoping that in, in my role in counseling that I actually can insert us in very intentionally so that that can happen. 

00:55:30
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY I'm very thrilled to hear you talk about a conversation. Uh, the predominance of my work now is international. And they're a good, fair number of people internationally that, that see, U.S. counselors coming over as imperialists. 

00:55:45
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. 

00:55:45
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY Uh, suspect everything, to suspect the CIA and so forth. They come in, here's our answer. Uh, too many of us Americans have that attitude. And your conversation can really shift but they've heard too much of the we're going to fix you. And uh, there's some places that don't want us anymore. So the conversation you're talking about, I'm delighted to hear this is going to be your emphasis. I can't tell you how, I can't tell you how pleased I am. I think that is so important. And I think we're basically back to a new story. We go over as the naive ugly Americans and let's have a conversation. What can we learn? 

00:56:20
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI That's right. 

00:56:20
DOCTOR ALLEN IVEY And we can learn an awful lot. In fact our old multicultural movement. What's going on in South Africa affects us here. 

00:56:30
DOCTOR CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI That's right. 

00:56:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS We've become, it sounds like the movement's sort of expanded and become more global in a sense. Doctor West-Olatunji, Doctor Ivey, I want to thank you for this time and, and giving me an opportunity to talk with you a little bit more about multiculturalism as the fourth force in counseling. I know I've learned a lot and that hopefully the viewers have as well. Thank you.

4th Force: The Multicultural Paradigm Interviews Second Interview Patricia Arredondo, Ed.D., Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Thomas Parham, Ph.D., Assistant Vice Chancellor, University of California, Irvine 

00:57:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS I am here with Doctor Patricia Arredondo and Doctor Thomas Parham and what we're here to do today is talk about multiculturalism as the fourth force in counseling. Uhm, first I just want to say thank you so much for coming here today and taking time to uh, help us understand what multicultural counseling is. Both of you have been, uh, in my experience, pretty significant figures in helping to shape the movement, if you will, and uh, uh, help us understand what multiculturalism is and its relevance in counseling. What I wanted to begin with was just to talk a little bit about what got you involved with the multicultural counseling movement? How did that begin for you? 

00:57:50
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well first, I want to say thank you for continuing this work. Uhm, Thomas and I have been at this for a few years. Uh, and really a long time. And it's very refreshing, encouraging and validating to know that there is yet another generation of professionals who is advancing the thought on multiculturalism in counseling. 

00:58:15
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Thank you. 

00:58:15
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Thank you. 

00:58:20
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And thank you uh, as well. I mean it's our pleasure, I think, to be here. But I think what, what Patricia talks about in reminding us about, there's another generation coming behind, uhm, we are really the latest arm of that legacy. Uhm, the great Algerian Frantz Fanon reminds us that, that every generation out of relative obscurity must reach out and seek to fulfill its legacy and portray it. And so, as we have been nurtured and mentored by the elders who came before us, we are the latest generation of those who've come behind to really pick up and try to fulfill the legacy that they left us. And so what you see reflected in the work that we have tried to produce and the bodies and the minds that we have tried to influence over the years, has really been the fulfillment of that legacy. 

00:59:15
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO And nothing starts in a vacuum, you know, you, we, we've talked about it, I believe in, in, our writing and in our presentations about the historical context. And that that historical context as, as Thomas eloquently said, had a lot of uh, spokespersons. Perhaps they didn't have the kind of platform that is, you know, we're continuing to have now. Uh, at the same time, that's why we are fortunate enough to reach into that uh, that history that, that thought leadership that was going on for many years when it comes to speaking about the voices of the underrepresented. The role of culture in our lives and how culture shapes all of us, you know, from our thinking to our values, to our behavior. And, you know, that's embedded in what we have framed as uh, multicultural competency and multicultural counseling. Uh, so it's not a historical, it's not a contextual, uhm, and it really does uh, address the, the phenomena of human development. 

01:00:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS What is, you talk a little bit about, there's a historical context in multicultural counseling. What is that? What's the history of multicultural counseling? What were the major events that helped shape the movement? Who are the major figures, in addition to yourselves, I think, who helped shape the multicultural counseling movement? 

01:00:45
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM For me, the historical context for the, the multicultural counseling movement does not begin in counseling or psychology. For me, I think the historical context emerges outside of the disciplines. So that there is a personal context in which human beings decided that they wanted to stand up and demand that they be recognized as members of the human family. And so you begin to see that quest for human authenticity within the context of that. The second element behind the personal is the social. And so there are a number of social movements which, you know, we'll talk about shortly that certainly have helped to shape the consciousness of a nation that then permeated into the profession. Uhm, and then third, for me, there's an operational uh, element to it. So we move from the personal to the social to the operational, where people said I am now looking for ways in which I can operationalize this new sense of consciousness, this new sense of awareness, this new sense of social justice, this new sense of the need for validation and affirmation, etcetera. And those are the things that then swept, I think, into the movement. And so then when you then begin to look at the, the historical anchors for where that is, you can look at several things. You can look at uhm, civil rights certainly. 

01:02:20
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Absolutely. 

01:02:20
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM As, as, as the major force in that. Uhm- 

01:02:20
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, you can link it even further back. I mean, I always think about the, you know, 1954 uh, Brown versus Board of Education as significant to, again, that was a huge consciousness raising event for, you know, uhm, looking back on it and as you read it. But, you know, that already was a marker in terms of the civil rights uhm, activity. 

01:02:45
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And that to me is, is really about, you know, civil rights. But ironically about that, uhm, if you think about that as a historical anchor, the Brown versus Board of Education was about African American kids in Topeka, Kansas in 1954, except, uh, for those who know the history, it begins really with brothers and sisters in both the Asian community and the Latino community. Uh, a few years before then, when you find, for example, in the case of uh, Westminster versus Mendez, uhm, that preceded Brown. Even through it had the same players and the Thurgood Marshalls and the Judge Carters and other folk who were uh, working with that particular case even before Brown came, uhm, Japanese farmers on the land, they are uh, expected to be able to uh, you know, work the land, do that, run into the questions about internment. And they're herded away. They lend the farm to Mendez family. Mendez family, who is Latino then tries to pick that up and want to send their children to Westminster schools, who then deny them admission to the schools. So the Westminster fight had both Asian roots, Latino roots, right? It proceeds up into Brown versus Board of Education. I mean it's those kinds of social movements that were taking place all around the country. But it's the people demanding, again, that human authenticity, demanding access to opportunity, and the privileges of full citizenship. And those kind of social movements Brown versus Board of Education, Emmett Till, Rosa Parks and Montgomery's bus boycott, civil rights, Doctor King, black power movements. Uhm, the peace movement. 

01:04:40
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, and the peace movement and then of course the migrant farmers- 

01:04:40
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Migrant farmers, exactly. 

01:04:45
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Workers movement here in California. You had all of these social, social movements that were uhm, about rights uh, about equity, about discrimination. And in putting it on the front page, you know, I was in Boston in the early seventies when they had a grape strike, uhm, out at the supermarkets. So we were, we were told to boycott the grapes. And that was the way the movements had already, you know, taken on much more of a national scope, uhm, and you didn't have to be in California to think about it. And, you know- 

01:05:20
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And that's the operational aspects that we were talking about earlier, sure. 

01:05:25
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

01:05:25
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM So all those things I think have had an impact on, on uhm, you know, what we do. 

01:05:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So it sounds like the multicultural movement really developed, evolved as-, it was really a microcosm of what was happening in society. 

01:05:40
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Exactly. 

01:05:40
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Uh, civil rights issues that were, were were occurring, issues related to equity, really spurned the multicultural counseling movement and forced the field of counseling and psychology to look internally in terms of what are we doing or not doing adequately to serve folks. 

01:05:55
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, and I, I think that we're probably being a little bit too uhm, generous by saying it, it uhm, led the professions to do that, because you know, if you look at this from a structural standpoint, you know, whether it's ACA or APA, I mean those structures were, you know, dominated by a particular mindset that was not inclusive, obviously, of multicultural thought. 

01:06:25
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Not just not inclusive, but resistant. 

01:06:25
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Resistant too, as well. So, I mean, even at the time and I forgot one more movement that was going on. Part of the civil rights was the whole awakening of the women's movement. And how that became uh, also a force. So you had this convergence of force. But again, to come back to your question, uh, and you said it before Thomas. It were, you know, the individuals who really marshalled the efforts to begin with. 

01:06:55
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And that's the piece that is so critical. I mean, it's important, I think, for our, our viewers to understand that much like individuals go through developmental transitions in their lives, so do social movements and so do organizations. And since organizations are, you know, inhabited and you know, the membership roles have filled up with individuals, the organizations themselves then move through similar developmental transitions in the say way that individuals do. And so it's not unlikely that those things would ultimately go head to head with trying to decide, you know, what that, that force would be as it wound up against lack of inclusion, as it butted up against elements of resistance, as it butted up against those things. But all that I think is part and parcel of what you're talking about in terms of that history and movement. 

01:07:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So what was happening in society was also happening in APA and ACA. 

01:07:50
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Oh, absolutely. 

01:07:55
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. Yes. Yeah. And you know, I can only, I'll speak more about uhm, ACA uh, and AMCD because, although I wasn't there at the time, that it started, but to Thomas' point, uh, you know, a group primarily of African American professionals uhm, championed by Samuel Johnson, who, you know, is very well known in AMCD. I mean that's why AMCD in many ways came to be was his, his stamina, his perseverance to, to bring this to fruition. And there's probably more details than, you know, than we have time to talk about, but it was those uhm, actions of exclusion that fueled the, the energy to persist. You know, when you can't have a room for a session to meet and organize yourself, you know, you're, you're just not included even though you're a member of what was then the Personnel and Guidance Association. All of that fuels people to take action and to empower themselves. 

01:09:05
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And demand expression, exactly. 

01:09:05
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Absolute-, yeah you have to. I mean, you know, you, you cannot be silenced. We won't be silenced. And that was you know, there's more history if we have some tapes, I think by Samuel Johnson, who was interviewed and talked about how all of this came about. Uhm, 1972, 1971-72. I think that's when we were chartered as the Association of Non-White Concerns. 

01:09:35
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And that becomes, yeah, that, that becomes really the operational, you know, definition of what we talked about earlier. But, it's important, I think, particularly for professionals and students alike who will view the tape, to not really have a surface structure understanding of what was going on, but rather really push to have more of a deep structure understanding, because to the, to the untrained eye, you can look at, for example, American Psychological Association, 1968, when a group of African American psychologists decide we've had enough. And they break away from APA. And they're talking about issues of inclusion. They're talking about issues of legitimacy. They're talking about the particular theoretical frameworks that pathologized black life so, you know, bad. They're talking about the testing movement and the degree to which it had a detrimental effect on black and Latino and Asian kids. I mean, all those kinds of things were going on in the context. So when people look at AB Psy (ph) in 1968 that becomes a precursor to a lot of this. The joint memberships of some of these folk, the Sam Johnsons, the Tom Gunnings, the Gloria Smiths, those folk early on who were involved in the, uh, what was the ANWC, The Association of Non-White Concerns of Personnel and Guidance in the early seventies. You know, they were deciding that we want to demand inclusion. And so what we will do is create our own, you know, association. But the point being, to the untrained eye, it looks like ah, these were just a group of frustrated you know, people of color who decided they're going to break away and do their own thing. I think at the deep structural level, what you want to understand in my mind is that this was about a cultural war. When you think about war, you think about really a protracted struggle. This was a protracted struggle around the ideology of different world views and how people were going to operationalize that within the context of their own life space. And the battlefield was fought on academic institutions, community health centers, hospitals, training programs, and in fact even within the professional associations like APA, ACA, etcetera. So if you think about a cultural war, what I talk about uh, is four elements. This was a war of ideology, where which world view, in fact, is going to be the one that people embrace. It was also a war of cultural values in that what are the values that we hold near and dear. The simplest one being, is it about the individualism or about the collective, you know, group of the folk. Uh, it was a war of cultural relevance, meaning if we're going to develop theories and constructs, how relevant are they not just to the psychologists and the counselors, but how relevant are they to the people? And fourth, it was a war of self-determination, meaning real power is about the ability to define your own reality. And so as you look at people engaging in more self-determined attempts to say let us define our own reality with our own segments and associations, with our own journals, with our own newsletters, with our own conventions, within conventions, all that was really about self-determination. So when you think, for me, at the deep structural level, it's important I think for our uhm, viewers to understand that this was really not just about frustrated people of color saying the institutions are just unresponsive to our needs. 

01:13:00
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO I think, and also the in addition, I think it's that very important uhm, multidimensional way of looking at it. That uh, I would want our viewers to take with them. It's complex. And I think the way Thomas laid it out suggests that this is complex change and it's not a matter of taking a document and running with it. Uh, fundamentally, there's more that has to change for-, structurally as well obviously for individuals and groups. And, you know, change never comes easily anyhow. Uhm- 

01:13:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS And it takes time. 

01:13:45
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO And it takes time. And, and that's why we're continuing to see uhm, changes, movements, uh, what you're doing today, which is 40, 50 years from when, when uh, AMCD started if we look, '72, my goodness. So we're, you know, we're looking at some uh, a need for uhm, refining, always-. You can't be complacent about any of this. Uhm, I know some of my colleagues were uh, reporting on a session they taught last night as a learning uh, conference here on supervision. And they took a poll of how many people had heard about the multicultural competencies. These are graduate students, okay, in our programs here. Less than half. Okay, now this is 2012. Uh, and, and I, I always find that perplexing. 

01:14:50
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM We were rolling competencies out in what? Early nineties? 

01:14:50
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Nineties, early nineties. Early to mid-nineties. So we're talking about 20 years. Oh, Thomas, this is 20 years from that article being published. My God, we should have been-, we have to celebrate that at the luncheon. Uhm, my point is that there are a couple of, of generations of faculty who've been taught in the milieu of the competencies. So yeah, you, you, I can never rest uhm, thinking that we're home. 

01:15:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Right, right. 

01:15:20
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uhm, that we're, our work is done. Hardly. 

01:15:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS And it sounds like you're saying the movement has accomplished a lot and yet there's still- 

01:15:30
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Oh, you know, it's accomplished a lot, yes. And I think that the word multiculturalism doesn't scare people perhaps like it used to. Uhm, and that the, the world actually, the change in the world, I think has benefitted the acceptance of looking at cross-cultural, multicultural issues, competency issues and doing business internationally on our college campuses, in the workplace, you know? Cultural competency is what people talk about at work, not, not even language as much. It's the competency to work interpersonally. So- 

01:16:10
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And that's the piece where you begin to see the discipline benefitting from the social movements internally. But now beginning to export its own theories and constructs into awareness to other disciplines outside. So lots of us do consulting in organization and development. So if you're in corporations, they know the language of multicultural competence. You know, if you're, if you're looking at uh, law firms. They know the language of cultural competence. When you're looking at people serving as expert witnesses, they know the language of cultural competence. You know, when you look at law enforcement. 

01:16:40
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

01:16:40
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Right. And having to work with and policing different communities. They know the language of cultural competence. So in many respects, the transformation that has occurred for me is not just about what we've done I think in the, in the counseling profession. Again, picking up on the legacy that we were blessed to inherit by some of the early pioneers. But also looking at the way in which uh, uh, other disciplines have begun to pick up momentum as well. 

01:17:10
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. It's application over (ph). 

01:17:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. Yeah. How did, because of the multicultural movement, from what you're describing sounds like it really focused on issues of race and ethnic issues and racism. How did other perspectives sort of join the movement? Issues of disability, women's rights, gay and lesbian? 

01:17:30
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, I think, I think that if you- 

01:17:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Because it seems to sort of broaden. 

01:17:35
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, yeah. Absolutely. I don't think it was that narrow to begin with. Because if you look at the original competencies, whether it was the document that Derald and some folks wrote in 1982 and then the 1992, 1992 version that we were a part of with Derald and, Derald Wing Sue and Rod McDavis. You know, we were really looking at structural issues and the effects of structural issues on client care, on uhm, you know, malpractice as I call it. You know, you're doing malpractice because you're so culturally uninformed and the, the agencies are just not providing services that are going to benefit the client in need. The training programs are not preparing uh, our students for the real world. So if you look at those documents, they talk about barriers, uhm, to, to serve as barriers to effectiveness, ethical behavior that really was not benefitting uhm, the clients and, and uh, even the students we were teaching. So I think that's part of it. But uhm, I would say that uhm, in the early nineties I wrote a couple pieces on the woman factor in multicultural counseling. And to me that was a big issue. Uh, you know, it's, it's part of our, our history too, of you know, gender inequities and sexism. And if you look at the 1996 document on operationalization was where we talked more comprehensively about multiple identities that we need to be knowledgeable about. You know, it's not (crosstalk) 

01:19:25
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Except if you look at that. Let's, let's, let's leave and pick up on that. If you think about where you know, we wrote about that, particularly I think with you and Rebecca and other folk picking that up. Uh, Rebecca Toporek we're talking about, uhm, and others. That was 25 years removed from when these associations and the movements first began to take hold within the counseling profession. So, you know, if we don't get ourselves caught in a, in a, in the time warp- 

01:19:50
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO This time warp, yeah. 

01:19:55
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Uhm, you know, we, we, we sometime have a tendency to in some cases almost delude ourselves into believing that somehow things were always like this. I think is wasn't. I think in, in, in my memory, in the original multicultural movement that took place, even in that cultural war, the war was primarily about race and ethnicity because the country was at that point was so focused on the discrimination and oppression that was endured by people of color. And so when you look at the original documents, even when, when uhm, uh, the Association of Non-white Concerns of Personnel and Guidance was started, uhm, you had primarily uh, African American folk in the forefront of that. But those elders had the good sense to say that we want to invite to the table, brothers and sisters from other cultural groups. And they even put a provision in- 

01:20:45
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO We still provide in the bylaws. 

01:20:45
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM In the bylaws. 

01:20:50
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

01:20:50
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM That said that we will create vice-presidential spots for the next group that has a certain threshold of membership. And they were looking for Latino folk and Asian folk and Indian folk, you know? And so there was less conversation at that point, I think, about gender. There was less conversation about disability. There was less conversation about uhm, sexual orientation. You know, those things I think emerged, I think, much later on. 

01:21:15
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

01:21:15
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And I think Patricia's right. That when you look at Derald's document. When Allen Ivey served as president of Division 17 in APA, Derald produced for him as part of a committee, a report that was ultimately submitted and received by APA in Division 17, but never really acted upon. 

01:21:35
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO It sat on the shelf. 

01:21:35
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM It sat on the shelf, really. That was 1981. And so that one begins to put in some of the structural elements that provide a different layer of inclusiveness, but even remember that's a decade removed from even when it first began. So even from that point to then go to '96 when you're doing that magnificent work with operationalizing it and putting in all those other elements of, of, of inclusion, that's another 15 years even from then. So you get, you get a chance to see the, the, the inclusion and the progressiveness. But the other piece, you know, I don't want to say that it was just all evolving, you know, consciousness that says we need to be more inclusive. Part of including that also there was an element of resistance. Like, we never thought about gender because women were such a part of the movement that we were involved in. You know, so the relationship between gender and race and ethnicity overlapped pretty clearly. But when you look at the other elements of diversity, what we saw was the profession itself beginning to embrace that, not so much the, the people of color. So the counseling association said, well let's think about disability. And the uhm, counseling association said let's think about gender. And the counseling association said let's think about the internationalization. Those things began to happen. But one of the things that we saw from the, from you know, the background is that you could address sexual orientation, disability, uhm, and you know, other elements of diversity, even social class, and never change the color. And so that's where the, when the movement began to come in, you began to see people begin to look back and go, uh, is that broader inclusion a threat to the progress that we are making on these core issues? And so we had to even, I think, work through some issues with that in order to say, no it isn't a threat. 

01:23:25
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

01:23:25
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM It really isn't. Inclusion is really going to help everybody. 

01:23:25
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Correct. 

01:23:25
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM But that's what you see going on, I think, in that 25 year span, and then a ten year span, and then the 15 year span, up to '96. And I think it's, it's now, kind of commonplace. 

01:23:35
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO And you know, and Thomas you bring up a really important point that, that happens when we have uhm, actions and movements and consciousness raising uhm, led by, you know, people like us who you know, have seen the disenfranchisement uh, within the association, with the profession, you know, for, for the people we serve. That it, that it is important for us to uhm, check with each other because you know, we could also feel like well, you know, we're, our multicultural movement is being left behind because now it's all about women, or now it's all about uhm, uhm, gay/lesbian/ bisexual/transgender issues. Rather I think to the inclusion point, what began to happen were co-movements that, that speak about the inclusion because you had people at the table who were really thinking about all of these uhm, uh, necessities to bring women in, to uhm, to give voice to what hadn't been at the table. And I just have to point out the women thing because I, I have historically championed that as well. And in the mid, I think is was mid-eighties, in ACA, and I was active in ACES. I was junior professor and uhm, I don't know if I've told this story on tape before, but I was at a luncheon at an at a, I guess we were AACD then, or one of our names, and this was my second luncheon. And the only people getting awards were men. And the woman who was up there was like handing the award, which was you know, too classic at the time. And I, I was just, just beside myself, and uhm, just had met some other women and uh, during the winter organized a group of women from ACES to come to the next conference which was in Houston and create uh, the Women's Interest Network within ACES. Uh, which I know still goes on. And uh, I think what's important in the work we do also is the extent to which we can institutionalize. So, these movements have a life that exists and, and continues long after those of us who perhaps championed it to begin with, you know, are moving on to other interests, or you know, so that the fact is that there's-, it's still relevant. Uh, there's still a need for it. There's still women who coalesce around it. And I remember when I was president of AMCD in '95, '96. And at the table were other-, the presidents of other associations. Uh, Agglebic(ph) at the time was not a division. And uhm, that was probably one of the, the fact that we had generated the '92 and '96 versions of the competencies was uh, another point of convergence. And I, what's the word when you, when people come together sort of uh, you know, coalition building, yeah. Uh, collaboration, coalition building. It was a sense of empowerment, you know? You, you, you know, AMCD was able to pull this off and was giving more fuel than to Agglebic. 

01:27:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. Yeah. So it sounds like the multicultural movement has really gone from an exclusive definition of multiculturalism to an inclusive definition as it really embraced what Audre Lorde talks about and that's that there's no hierarchy of oppression. 

01:27:25
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah, right. 

01:27:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS And it's all harmful. And it's really about working collaboratively power numbers that address our concerns. 

01:27:35
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Yes. Yes. 

01:27:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS You talk uh, throughout this interview about the competencies. Uh, what are the multicultural competencies in a nutshell? 

01:27:45
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Uhm, 

01:27:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Because they seem like they've been really important in helping shape the movement. 

01:27:50
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Oh it's been a, been a, been a critical not only movement but, but uhm, really document that allows us to really again move to that space of how do we operationalize this? That people have developed the uhm, the mindset that says I need to be more culturally competent. For me the two most important questions in therapy are either what and how? What do I want to do? How do I do it? The profession was clear that what it needed to do was to be more multiculturally competent. What it didn't have you know, much of a clue about was how do I do it? So if I line up in African American, in Asian American, Chicano Latino, American Indian, you know, folk in chairs, and said to any clinician who would sit on the other side, how would your theoretical approach vary based upon the culture of those particular individuals that you're seeing. Most folk couldn't pass that test because they know that they need to be more culturally sensitive, but what does that mean? They know they need to have an understanding of world view, but what does that mean? They know they need to have different techniques that are based on, on the culture and the lifestyles and the mindsets and the values and the morays and customs and traditions of those people who are culturally different but didn't have a sense of that. So what we were able to do in producing that uhm, in fact the first document in '92 came out of in fact a, a, some friends doing some favors really. Because I had to-, when I was president of AMCD I said I will not leave this presidency not having produced a couple of fundamental documents. uhm, one of them was to pull together Derald Sue, Rod McDavis, Patricia Arredondo, and I said I need to twist some arms. I didn't have to do much twisting. They were more than glad to do it. I said that I want to come out of this presidency having produced a document that tells people how we do this. So, it's out of that piece with the stellar work that they did as a committee, and Patricia and Rod and Derald produced that document that then we received. But strategically what we decided to do was also to publish the document rather than sit it on a shelf like Division 17 did with Derald's piece in '81. We published it on two places. We published it in the AMCD journal so that the people of color would see it. But we also published it right, in the Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development. But we also published it in the JCD in the Journal of Counseling and Development for the broader association to be able to see, because we knew that some of them would not read the AMCD journal. And so that was really the, the you know, context in which a lot of that occurred. And, and that was so central to that. But what's important about even looking at the competencies, we looked at developing awareness. We looked at developing knowledge. And we looked at developing skill. In that sequential order. And what we wanted to do, I think, in terms of institution building we were talking about earlier is the multicultural movement and its strength cannot be based on personality. 

01:31:05
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Right. 

01:31:05
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM So whether, you know, the Joe White's of the world, you know, seminal thinker in what we've done. The Sam Johnsons of the world. The Carol Anthonys (ph) of the world. The Rico Trues (ph) of the world. The Stanley Sues and Derald Sues of the world. The Allen Iveys of the world. The Paul Petersons of the world. All those other folk who have been the elders of the profession have really given us lots of that information. If it's only personality driven, then when those personalities fade, so does the movement. Our job was to try to institutionalize it in a way that said that irrespective of who's doing the lecture or you know, who's reading it, the principle is sound. And the principle of the competency said, No we're not going to start with give me 25 words or less without commercial interruption. No, we're not going to start with here's the one book or two books you can read to enhance your knowledge base. What we're going to start with is a mindset that says if we can't help you interrogate the biases and assumptions you bring with you into this therapeutic space, the awareness piece, then all else is for naught. So that's why it starts sequentially with awareness, then moves to knowledge to then say let's enhance your knowledge base. And then finally to the techniques and skills that will help you operationalize it. 

01:32:20
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO And understanding that the techniques and skills are the nexus. It's sort of an interdependent nexus of the awareness, knowledge and skills. The skills never happen, as you know, independently of, of the knowledge uh, and of the skills. And again, when I think about, and the awareness rather. When I think about the knowledge, too, as we've described it, it's not just what do I know about a Mexican American woman or a Mexican American college student. Where is she? Is she on a, at a college campus? Is she from Texas versus Florida? Uh, you know, what is her, what are her achievement goals? what is the class? I mean, so it's more complicated than simply knowledge around culture and you know, the stereotypes that come in when you just think of, of culture from you know, the menu of attributes of a person. And, and in so much that I think how this has continued to be a force, and I'm not sure if we're answering your question because it's all so organic. 

01:33:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS You are. 

01:33:25
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Good. But I think about what Thomas said that it's not about personalities. And yet, how we've moved from the eighties, a number of us together, the eighties, the nineties, to where we are today. It's been intentionally uhm, an intentional engagement that we knew that publishing the documents was one piece of dissemination and one way that we communicated the knowledge. But we needed to have training institutes. We needed to come to ACA and insure that the programs were not going to be hit or miss when it came to talking about multicultural issues. We charged and at that ACA have criteria in the programs that speaks of, that it includes diversity, addressing diversity as one of the criteria. So we were really also looking at informing organizational change. I guess what I would also like to add it, and we know that a lot of what has occurred is the development of more identity movements. Uh, competency movements related to identity groups, I guess is what I could say. With those same, the tri-part model of awareness, knowledge and skills for working with American Indians or First Nations people. In Milwaukee we call, in Wisconsin it's First Nations people. I think it depends on where you are geographically. You know, the competencies for working with Latinos. Now, that's again a very pan-ethnic word. Uh, when you talk about that, you get a little deeper. Competencies for working with gay/lesbian/bisexual/ transgender individuals. And I know there are uh, documents for working with transgendered individuals, competencies, statements. So I just think that this movement continues to uh, empower, as I said, empower identity groups and actually those groups as well consider the, the interdimensionality or multidimensionality of the identity. Because you can be Latino and you can be wealthy. And you can be Latino and you can come from the migrant farm uhm, family situation. So it, it really challenged us to think complexly. I think that's one of the things. It's, it's, you know multicultural uh, competencies, the whole movement is about complex thinking, analytical thinking, perspectives taking, you know, challenging again our fundamental biases and assumptions about our lives, needless to say, and also the lives of others. And you know, what's, what's fair and what's not fair in life? You know? Anyway, I was going to go down a- 

01:36:20
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM No, but what's true about that, and, and picking back up on the question. It's important, I think, that people not just learn kind of the breadth of the multicultural counseling which is where people are moving in terms of force, but the depth. And I think what I hear in Patricia's remarks is really talking about the depth. It's like, if you think about the movement and the force and how the competencies are the latest attempt to operationalize that, the force has always been about human authenticity. It has always been about trying to counter some of what we saw traditional counseling and psychology with respect to pathology with strength. So it's strength versus pathology. It's always kind of the collective versus the individual. You know, it's always about those elements that are there that looked at that. But at a deep structural level, what we're really talking about is a cultural movement. And the cultural movement is not simply about the people. It's not simply about the, that's perhaps one of the greatest misunderstandings about the multicultural movement and the force is that, you know, there's a, a, a sameness between skin color and consciousness. You know, there's a sameness between the demographic you represent and the competency that you display. And it isn't. At a deep structural level what we're really talking about in culture is really a, a complex constellation of these morays and values and customs and traditions that really provide a general design for living and a pattern for interpreting reality. So the question that becomes, if you're looking across at a client, or you're looking at a student in a classroom, or someone in the community that you're, you're, you're training or consulting with, what is their design for living and what patterns do they use to interpret reality? So when you think about understanding the competencies at a deep structural level, it's not just the breadth of the awareness, not a skill on all even the, the different domains that, that we put in there. At the depth of that, to me, is really an understanding of five elements of culture. One is ontology. What are the onotological assumptions? What's the nature of reality for different people? Second would be axiology, meaning what is the value system that people embrace? The third element of culture would be cosmology, meaning what is the relationship between a people and a divine force in the universe because we talk a lot about spirituality as one of the fundamental differences between our, our movements and traditional psychology and counseling. The fourth would be epistemology, piston. What is your system for knowing and understanding what is true? And the fifth would be praxis, meaning what is the system for human contact and human interaction? So that if you look at those five elements ontology, axiology, cosmology, epistemology, and praxis, and you look at those then across different elements. So whether you are African American, Asian American, Latino, Caucasian, uh, American Indian, International la, la, la, whatever the group is, you can find that there are ways in which people relate to that at the cultural deep structure level that is operationalized within the context of the competencies that, that uh, that we developed. 

01:39:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS And, and, and just-, it sounds like the multicultural counseling movement in a nutshell has sort of pushed back against the first and second and third forces which operate from a one size fits all approach. 

01:39:50
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Absolutely. 

01:39:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS This theory will apply to any client, all clients. And, and multiculturalism has said, well, not really. I mean, that sounds challenging and so, for counselors, and so what's the buy in for counselors to operate from a multicultural (crosstalk) 

01:40:05
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, understandably those forces, you know, existentialism, and, and uhm, CBT and psychodynamic, you know, they're not going to weigh in. They will always exist and, and, and there are, uhm, it's a methodology for working. Uhm, I think it's a world view. Uhm, albeit I can be doing CBT therapy, but I still have to think about the multicultural framework that I would introduce in, in that kind of therapy modality. Uhm, you know, it doesn't, and same thing, I remember when I was back East in psychodynamics theory and I had a client from Latin America who had been in more psychodynamics theory, psychoanalytic you know, theory, and I-, she's Latina, an immigrant from Columbia. But, you know, anybody who's in psychoanalytic, I mean if if you're aware, you know, it's only for privileged people. And, so she came from a different sort of context than some of the Puerto Rican people I was working with in Boston. And, so you have to adjust. So from a cultural standpoint, I understood it. I'm not a, I don't practice psychoanalysis. I didn't at the time. But what I'm saying is you do have to look at the cultural aspect regardless of the modality that we're talking about. The second thing I want to add and it's actually to build on what Thomas said in terms of the uh, understanding uhm, the client or all of us understanding ourselves. You know, you take it to the supervisor. And, and where the supervisor's mindset is uhm, around praxis, around cosmology. And this is where we do have a lot of Achilles heels in the profession. Uhm, because our supervisors, I believe, still work from a paradigm that's, that's very status quo. 

01:42:15
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Yeah. 

01:42:15
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO And, and they, and I only see it because I have had doctoral students who did their dissertations in the supervision area. And uh, they were kind of blown away because they had come out of a very strong multicultural movement at ASU and, you know, we lived and breathed it. And they're doing their dissertations in college counseling centers where we think that there's more, you know, awareness of, of multicultural competencies. And uhm, you know, to find out, and I'll just give one real small example where this supervisor was not bringing up issues with the supervisee uh, because he wasn't sure how to talk, talk about LGBTQ issues with the supervisee. 

01:43:05
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM So their own, you know, discomfort with that? 

01:43:10
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. 

01:43:10
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Well, see and see part of (crosstalk) 

01:43:10
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO What a loss. What a loss. 

01:43:10
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Well, and clearly around all those dimensions of culture and competence that we talk about. But what's interesting in terms of a phenomenon that you highlight very clearly is we are now entering probably the second generation of trainees who are coming through with young professionals who still need supervision for licensure or for, you know, to get out of the doctoral and masters programs who are actually more culturally competent than the people who supervise them. 

01:43:35
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Supervisors, yeah. 

01:43:40
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And so, that's the tension, I think, that Patricia talks about. But, backing up also to the to the uh, the question about you know, the, kind of the form and the force. It isn't that we were just pushing against the theories. You know, the psychodynamic, the existential, the cognitive behavioral force, whatever. But what we had to understand is even if you grapple with human authenticity, even as you grapple with, you have to find strength and not just pathology. Even as you grapple with, we have to find, you know a collective sense of consciousness, not just, you know, focus on the individual. What we're really talking about there is a fundamental understanding of the human condition. And that as we are trained to use theories as sets of abstract concepts that we use to make sense out of data that we see. In my mind, there ought to be something wrong with a theoretical approach that leaves any client or a people strangers to themselves, aliens to their culture, oblivious to their condition and inhuman to their oppressors. And that to me is what some of these theories did. 

01:44:50
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Right. And I, and I think too, if you, there's a piece that I still like to quote that was published in '88 on neglecting the cultural factor in counseling, neglecting the cultural factor in psychology, and why do we neglect it. And I think it speaks to some of what Thomas is saying is, you know, focus too much on the pathology, you know, looking at biological explanations for people's conditions versus looking at the the society and policy and, you know, legislation that, you know, oppresses people. So we overly focused on the biological. You know, second was the whole ideology in the United States that we're all equal, that everyone has the same, you know, rights to access and to freedom. And so if we really believe that, I mean, philosophically, fine, you know? That there's equal rights. But if-, we know in practice that doesn't happen. So, you know, and then there's also, you know, using stereotypes was another reason as, as neglecting you-, I think I know you because uh, you know, I think you're Asian American maybe, you know? And, and, but then, you know that's obviously so superficial. The fourth reason was that there was just a fear of, of getting to know people who were different from ourselves. 

01:46:05
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Right. 

01:46:10
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Because, you know, some people just have, some individuals just have the convenience in life to, to not have to do that and figured, why? I mean, I can go back to the mid-eighties when I was teaching at BU, and, and one of my doctoral students who said, I don't know why we have to take this multicultural counseling course, because I'm not going to work with people "like that". And I said, okay, you know? So here's the moment of truth. Uhm, the point is that that's, that was another reason we neglected it is, you know, professors thinking well, I'm not preparing students for that, that kind of clientele. So, you know, you, you look at reasons, and this is where, I think, those of us who've worked so hard at this, is you have to think all the way around. You have to have like this 360 perspective uh, to anticipate what the uhm, the dissing is going to be about, you know, what the resistance is going to be about. You have to think and I remember in some of the literature we talk about being hypervigilent, which you know, it's hypervigilent in a different kind of sense. 

01:47:20
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM It's like paranoia. 

01:47:20
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO But you, you know, you have to be, you know, your, your mindset has to be 360 degrees so what is going to be the opposing viewpoint on why the competencies aren't endorsed? Uhm, so we, we can never be, I think, rest on our laurels that this is morally sound, you know? As Thomas said, we really argue about how important it is to change structures, to prepare the next few generations of people who are going to be practicing and living and working in a very different society. 

01:48:00
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM And to not do so without relying on other folk. I mean the, in the 2002 book I wrote on counseling persons of African descent, I devoted an entire page to one line. And the publishers said, You don't want to do a whole page. Yes I do. The first line of the book in the preamble says, Healing is therapeutic but not all therapy is healing. 

01:48:20
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Right. Right. 

01:48:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So you talked a lot about the benefits of multicultural counseling for counselors, for clients. You talked a little bit about the challenges, for example, supervision and the lack of cultural competence around supervisors. Where do you see the movement heading in the future? The multicultural counseling movement? As you look at where we've been, where we're at, where are we going? Or where does it need to go? 

01:48:55
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO It's going to continue to be a movement that uhm, informs the profession of counseling. Albeit, I think there are times uhm, and I remember this book about, the conspiracy theories, right? Anyway, I won't go there. Conspiracy theories back in the early eighties. Uhm, what I think is development of, as we both said earlier, this generation of leaders who will continue to expand on the uhm, the basis of the framework for multicultural counseling, the, sort of the beliefs, the philosophy and the practice side of it. Uhm, and do it in a way that uh, begins to demonstrate change in the lives of people. Now that's going to be the hardest thing to do because we continue to get asked about data. You know, show us the data. You know, how is multicultural counseling- 

01:50:00
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Empirically based. 

01:50:00
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Empirically based. 

01:50:00
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Different, even a different world view assumption. You know, I think for me, the movement is going to continue to grow. And I think it will do that, but its growth will also bring with it some danger points. For me, the biggest danger point is the, on, on two levels. The first is how do we sustain the momentum without losing the substance, because what passes for multicultural competence nowadays in some cases is very substantive. But in some cases what passes is just comical. So we've got to be able to sustain the momentum but also not lose the substance. The other piece is we have to teach our students that you cannot be a healing presence. Counselors and psychologists, we are healers. And you can't be a healing presence in the lives of other people if you lose the capacity to believe that people can, can elevate themselves to rightful places of rulership and mastery over their own circumstance. And so there has to be a level of social engineering that is tied to what we do and the same thing we do around social justice that is not just about treating clients in the individual context of therapy. 

01:51:10
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Right. 

01:51:10
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM But in fact, uses the force and the profession to be able to transform really the lives of people and transform the larger society. 

01:51:20
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO And, and this is where the whole piece on the social justice movement comes in. And the real, uh, boundary-less tie in together. Uhm, is that the advocacy part of the social justice movement is so important for involvement of our clients, of ourselves, to see how we can affect change at a local level. And, and you know, that's without being grandiose. You know, I can't change society but locally I can work with a couple of MPS schools, Milwaukee Public Schools, uh, through a math literacy program that you know, empowers the counselor who is there, the teachers, the kids ultimately. And I really believe it does require us to look at these, and it's not random acts of kindness. It's intentional acts that will help to change systems. And, and using our consciousness to change the systems, our knowledge to change the systems. And, and not have expectations that we're going to change the whole school system. But maybe we'll affect change in that particular building. And you asked me before about, you know, where we're going and where social justice fits in. I think the advocacy movement and the multicultural movement are both forces that are, are just interdependent. I mean- 

01:52:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah, they seem to be complementary forces, sort of two sides of the same coin. You can't do one without the other. You talked a lot about a lot. Uhm, I want to thank the both of you for your time. Uhm, your passion for, for helping to develop the movement, if you will, and your continued work in it. 

01:53:10
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM We appreciate it. And thank you and beyond thanking even the viewers, I hope what happens is that the ancestors and the elders who have really given us the shoulders that we stand on will be pleased with the work we do. And hopefully the students that we have trained, the professionals we've impacted will in fact be motivated and excited enough, stimulated enough by the work we've done to continue this on so that we all continue to fill that legacy rather than betray it. 

01:53:35
DOCTOR PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, it's a lifelong journey. 

01:53:40
DOCTOR THOMAS PARHAM Yeah.

Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

01:54:40
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Today what you're going to be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy. The first interview will be taking place with Doctor Cirecie West-Olatunji and Doctor Allen Ivey. Both are experts in the multicultural uhm, movement in counseling and psychotherapy. The second interview that you'll be able to watch is an interview with Doctor Patricia Arredondo and Doctor Thomas Parham. Again, multicultural scholars who've really helped shape the multicultural counseling perspective uh, into what it is today. In each of these particular interviews, uh, we'll be highlighting some of the major historical events as well as figures who helped shape the multicultural perspective to what it is today. Each interviewee will also have an opportunity to highlight some of the major tenets of the multicultural perspective as well as discuss uh, some of the major research that's happening now that is impacting the field of multicultural counseling. Following both of these particular interviews, uh, you'll have an opportunity to watch a live demonstration of a counseling session with uh, Doctor Agnes Kwong, who's a psychologist at the University of Washington. And what Doctor Kwong will be doing is working with a particular client uh, and uh, from a multicultural perspective. And so, within this particular uh, uh, clinical session, you'll have an opportunity to sort of see how she operationalizes multiculturalism with this particular client. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy, where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling uh, as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition, which is the first force in counseling. The second force is referred to as a cognitive/behavioral tradition, the third being the existential/humanistic tradition, the fourth the multicultural counseling paradigm, and last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy.

4th Force: The Multicultural Approach to Psychotherapy Agnes Kwong, Ph.D. Psychologist, University of Washington 

01:56:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So hi, Annie. 

01:56:55
ANNIE Hi. 

01:56:55
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Uhm, so thank you for coming in today. We have about 45, 50 minutes of so for me to get a sense of what brings you in and uhm, how I might be able to help you. Uhm, before we begin, do you have any questions for me and how I work? 

01:57:10
ANNIE Not really. I don't really know how this works in general. 

01:57:15
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

01:57:15
ANNIE This is my first time here. And I kind of didn't want to come anyway. Uhm, so I don't really have any questions. But if I have questions later on, I can ask? 

01:57:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Absolutely. At any point in time if you have any questions, you know, about how I work, or any questions about what we're, you know, what we're doing and why we're doing what we're doing, uhm, please feel free to ask me. Uhm, so yeah, I know the first time can be a little bit scary. 

01:57:45
ANNIE I've never been to see a counselor or a therapist before. 

01:57:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So what brought you in now? 

01:57:50
ANNIE Uh, my, well, my friend Lauren said I should come. 

01:57:55
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

01:57:55
ANNIE I haven't been going to class for the last three or four weeks. Uhm, so she was kind of, you know, worried, because she hasn't heard from me in a while. Uhm, so she came into my house and made me come. 

01:58:10
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Do you have a sense why you haven't been going to class? 

01:58:20
ANNIE I, I don't think I, well, I was, the reason I, you know, went back to school was to get a degree to get a job to help out with the finances at home. Uhm, with my husband uhm, but now, you know, it's gotten better in terms of his ability of his job. So now it's, well he's saying that maybe, you know, that I don't need to go. You know? And I could just stay home and you know, I could start my family. And we don't-, I don't, I don't need a degree. I don't need to go to school. Uhm, so that's why. And I'm not the best student. I don't get A's or anything. So, maybe it's no big deal. 

01:59:10
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. So what I'm hearing is you came to school to have, get, to hopefully get a job to help out with family. And now it sounds like that isn't a necessity anymore. But it, what, what do you want to do? I'm curious. Do you want to continue? Do you not? Because I'm hearing that he said, oh, you don't have to, you don't have to do this anymore. But, what, what do you want? 

01:59:45
[sil.] 

01:59:45
ANNIE I like school. And it's, it's actually really fun. You know, it's uhm, I like being in classes and I like going out with my classmates after class and talking about what we learned. But, if I don't need to, you know, why go? So- 

02:00:10
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. How have you been feeling in the last few weeks? 

02:00:20
[sil.] 

02:00:25
ANNIE I guess, I guess kind of sad, because I do like school. You know? So being at home and not being around that, I miss it. You know, and running a home, it's just me. My husband works. And I sit at home and watch the TV and you know it's not the same. You know? So it's, yeah, it's kind of sad. I miss it. 

02:01:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah, you do. What do you think would happen if you said you wanted to continue in school? If you shared with your husband that that's what you wanted. 

02:01:10
ANNIE I don't think he'd be happy about that. I know he won't be happy about that. Because and I, he's not happy when I'm not home. You know, and he's, he's worried about me. You know, when I'm not home. You know? So, I think he'd be happier you know, if I'm home, and you know. And you know, and the house is cleaner and you know, things get taken care of easier, because when I go to school I come home pretty tired. You know? And there's things at home I could do. So it's easier in general to stay home. 

02:01:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG It's easier but it sounds like you're not very happy. 

02:02:00
ANNIE I could be happy, you know? You know, it's, I feel like I'll miss it for a while. But, you know, then I'll get used to life back in the house, you know? I'll just, I'll just take some time to get used to it again. 

02:02:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. What was it like before? It sounds like you had some period of time where you weren't in school. What was that like? 

02:02:25
ANNIE It just, it was just, you know, it was kind of boring, you know, staying at home, taking care of the house. Because you know, going shopping. I shop a lot. I think I shop a lot because I'm bored. Uhm, yeah. I guess I was kind of bored. 

02:02:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. Do you know what uhm, what your husband's concerns would be if you were to go to school or what his hopes are? 

02:03:05
ANNIE Well, our hope, you know, hopes when we talked about it before is just, you know, to start a family but more when we're stable in terms of financially. And we are now, because his job's more stable now. So now would be a great time to start a family, you know? 

02:03:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So timing might be right. 

02:03:25
ANNIE Right. 

02:03:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Is that-? What do you want to do? 

02:03:35
ANNIE I wish I could have both. And go to school and have a family. 

02:03:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Mmm hmm. 

02:03:45
ANNIE But I don't think that's possible. 

02:03:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Do you have anybody in your life that you've seen who has made that happen before, where they have a relationship and even maybe a family and go to school? 

02:04:05
ANNIE Well, I don't have, I don't really have that many friends. 

02:04:05
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

02:04:10
ANNIE And I would call them more acquaintances. I can't think of any that has both at the same time. I would say no. 

02:04:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So it feels unattainable? 

02:04:25
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. 

02:04:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Do you have a sense if you had all the support that you could have to do what you wanted to do, and you didn't have the pressure of starting the family right now, what you would want to do? What your dreams are? 

02:04:50
ANNIE Oh, that's a (inaudible )questions. I think if I was younger, you know, if I went to college right after high school, I could do that. You know, but I'm not that age anymore. And I, if I was that age, if I was that age, I think I could, you know, get a degree and then I think work for a bit and then have kids. But I didn't realize that was what I wanted back then when I was that age, you know? So I feel like the time's passed for that. Second guess. 

02:05:40
[sil.] 

02:05:45
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Is it bringing up some regrets for you? 

02:05:45
ANNIE Yeah. Yes it is. 

02:05:55
[sil.] 

02:06:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG When I, I'm aware you didn't even really, it's hard to even talk about what those dreams would be. 

02:06:10
ANNIE I don't know if-, it's still not really, it's not really concrete in my head, you know? So I don't really know what they are either. It's just, I've just really been really, I'm just saying if I went that route. 

02:06:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:06:25
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:06:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG I guess I'm curious. Well, when, when did you get married with your husband? 

02:06:35
ANNIE Uhm, let's see. It must have been when I was 18, so that would make 20-ish. 20. 

02:06:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. So how many years since then? 

02:06:45
ANNIE Uh, it's almost ten. 

02:06:45
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. Okay. Uhm, I'm curious about some of your values about what it means to be a wife, or a partner. Uhm, yeah, what's important to you in that role? 

02:07:10
[sil.] 

02:07:10
ANNIE I think it's really important to be there for your children. It's really important to be supportive, you know, of my husband, because he's, you know, he works really hard. And he brings home the money. Uhm, you know, and I think kids need, need to have the mom home. And that's real important. 

02:07:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. And does that feel consistent with your husband's partners value? 

02:07:50
ANNIE Mmm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I don't want to put my kids in day care. You know? 

02:08:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:08:00
ANNIE And, and in my, in my culture, I guess we can ask my mom to come and stay with us for a while, but we live too far away. So I don't think it's an option. 

02:08:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:08:20
ANNIE You know? So- 

02:08:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Where is your family? 

02:08:25
ANNIE Uhm, like on the East Coast. 

02:08:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about your, your parents or family and maybe even what their, your family structure was like? Who worked? 

02:08:45
ANNIE Yeah, uhm, well they both worked. Uhm, it's me and my brother who was uh, four years younger. Uhm, my mom was a nanny. And my dad uhm, worked in a restaurant. 

02:09:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

02:09:00
ANNIE Uh, you know, so my mom was never home. She took care of other children. 

02:09:10
[sil.] 

02:09:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So that absence. It still touches you today. 

02:09:25
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:09:30
[sil.] 

02:09:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG And I imagine that's hard as you think about whether or not you would want to go back to school or even thinking about going back to school and potentially being absent for your children and what that would be like. 

02:09:45
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:09:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:09:50
ANNIE Yeah. And I'm, I'm good with kids. You know, I took care of my brother growing up. You know, so- 

02:10:00
ANNIE So you were really put into an adult role pretty early on? 

02:10:10
ANNIE Right. Yeah. 

02:10:15
[sil.] 

02:10:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG How did your dad feel about your mom working? 

02:10:20
ANNIE Well, it's not really like she had a choice, you know? They came here and they didn't have any money so they both had to work. But I know that, you know, even though it's never been said, I know that we would have been better off or they would have preferred to have my mom home with us. So-, yeah. 

02:10:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So you're feeling kind of stuck. 

02:10:50
ANNIE Yeah. I guess. I mean, I-, I guess. I don't think-, I don't know. I don't think I'd be stuck for a while, for long, you know, because like I said, I'll get over it. I'll get over it. You know, and we'll move on and yeah, I'll get over it. And it just, because I'm just stuck for now. But it's only, it's not going to last very long. 

02:11:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Oh, I guess I-, and it, it sounds like this has been going on for a while, feeling bored. 

02:11:35
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah, it has. 

02:11:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. Well, what brings you joy? What brings you joy when you're not in school? 

02:11:50
ANNIE I know, my husband. Uhm, you know, we do things together. That's really fun. I don't know. Yeah, that's about it. 

02:12:05
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG You mentioned shopping. 

02:12:05
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah, I like to shop. I like to find deals. I think, you know, when I, when I outsmart a deal or outsmart a store, that's kind of fun. 

02:12:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:12:20
ANNIE So, because finding a bargain-. It's challenging, I guess in that sense to do that, to figure out how to best, the best way to get a bargain. 

02:12:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. Well, I'm hearing that when you were in school you, you felt a sense of uhm, a sense of meaning. You met more people. Uhm, and you know, I, I, it, I agree with you. It would be challenging having a family and, and school and uhm-. But I also know it's doable. Uhm- 

02:13:00
ANNIE Is it? 

02:13:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG I have met with people who have, you know, somehow managed it and uhm, and so I, I've seen it happen. Uhm, but, but not without its challenges. Uh, and often with the support of family and, and partners. 

02:13:25
ANNIE I don't think I'm like those people. 

02:13:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG How so? 

02:13:30
ANNIE I'm not smart enough to do both. 

02:13:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Where did you get that belief? 

02:13:35
ANNIE I'm just not. I'm just not. You know, I've never gotten really good grades in school. I have to work really hard to get even B's. So it's-, I don't think I can do both. I've met people who just, can just read a book and just get really good grades. And I just, I could spend, you know, hours and days on a, a paragraph or something and I, and I won't be able to regurgitate that on a test. I've met people who can do that, and I'm just, I'm just not one of those people that can do that. 

02:14:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG And yet you've been getting B's you said. 

02:14:20
ANNIE Well, yeah, but I have to work really hard. But B's aren't good enough. 

02:14:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG What's good enough? 

02:14:35
ANNIE You know, A's. So yeah, I'm not a model student or the best student. So I think if I, if I don't go to school it's not, it's not like uhm, it's not like nothing's-, it's no big deal. 

02:14:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Where did you get the idea that A's was-, it sounds like some of the belief is that A's is what you need to, to be in school and to be good enough. And I'm wondering where that comes from? Those are really high standards. 

02:15:10
ANNIE Well, I guess from my parents. At one, and I guess a lot of, you know, my friends who are mostly [02:15:20 Asian, you know, who have good grades. 

02:15:15
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. Yeah. 

02:15:25
ANNIE You know, they're the type to get degrees. You know? And be professionals. So, I'm just not that type. So- 

02:15:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG What was-, when you were in school for the short period of time-. And how long was it that you were in school? 

02:15:45
ANNIE Uhm, it was, it was a year. 

02:15:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

02:15:50
ANNIE And then I went uh, fall quarter this year. And then winter quarter. 

02:15:55
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

02:16:00
ANNIE And I went for like, three weeks, and then haven't gone the last three or four weeks. 

02:16:05
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. How did you do in that year? 

02:16:05
ANNIE You know, B's-ish. Yeah. It's hard. You know? It's a lot of writings, lot of reading, and I, when I'm doing well, but I can't be home, you know, to get my husband in the house. And if I have kids, I can't do that. So- 

02:16:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Were you doing full time courses? 

02:16:35
ANNIE Yeah, because we were trying to you know, get my degree as soon as possible so then I could help out, get a job and help out with the finances. Because you can't really get a job nowadays with just you know, a high school diploma. You need to get a degree in something. 

02:16:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Well, and I also know people sometimes take, you know, go part-time, you know, particularly if they're starting a family. And it may not happen in the exactly the same way that your friends might do it, or you know? 

02:17:15
ANNIE I don't know. Maybe it's just the time's passed, you know? So, it's just not the right time anymore. 

02:17:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. I'm curious about uhm, the pressure to start a family. You mentioned that, that the timing is good and it's something your, your husband had, had said that he would like to do now. If were up to you, let's say it were, what, what would you, what would you want to do? When would you want to start a family? 

02:17:55
ANNIE If it was up to me, and even in terms of biology, maybe like in five more years? But you know, the chance of birth defects increases when someone's past like 30, or 35, something like that. So it's like, like it's now. 

02:18:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So you're feeling that biological time pressure as well? 

02:18:30
ANNIE Right. 

02:18:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG And how old are you right now? 

02:18:35
ANNIE Uhm, 31. 

02:18:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. Okay. Are there pressures from other places aside from your husband, who's really wanting you to have children and start a family? 

02:18:50
ANNIE Well, yeah, my parents. You know, we've been together for so long that it's just, it's natural. We haven't yet because it's been so hard in terms of finances, and the economy and everything. So- 

02:19:05
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So how do they communicate to you that they would like you start a family? 

02:19:10
ANNIE They ask. You know, when are you going to start a family? When are you going to start having kids? You know? You're not getting any younger. You know? 

02:19:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So there's always that reminder. 

02:19:20
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:19:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG From family. 

02:19:25
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:19:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:19:30
[sil.] 

02:19:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG I guess I'm really hearing different sources in your life pulling you in one direction, family, husband, whom sounds like you really value what your husband believes. Uhm, wanting a certain path for you. And you too, a part of yourself is what I'm really hearing is, you know, it's not you wanting one thing and you know, these other people wanting something else. But, uhm, you know, there's just different desires that you have. Yeah. How have you made decisions moving, I guess when you reflect back on your life, when you have wanted one thing or different things and your family or partner wants something else. How do you, what do you consider in making those decisions? 

02:20:30
ANNIE If it's like big decisions, like this, you know, I go along, I go along with what everybody else wants because it's what you're supposed to want. Right? You know, you finish school, then get married, then have kids. So it's, I don't know, I never really had to make those big decisions. It just sort of happened. 

02:21:05
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So it doesn't feel like you've had, had any dilemmas moving forward in terms of-? 

02:21:10
ANNIE No. 

02:21:10
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Choosing a partner, or- 

02:21:15
ANNIE No. 

02:21:15
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Where to-. What was it like to move to, I guess, being in the Pacific Northwest and you said they're in the East Coast? 

02:21:20
ANNIE Yeah. It was really hard. I don't have any friends here. And I pretty much lost uhm, touch with most of my friends back home anyway. 

02:21:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:21:35
ANNIE Uhm, yeah. It's uhm, and it's different here. You know, the way we communicate is different here too. Yeah, but it's been hard. You know, it's like it's, been hard. 

02:21:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG How did you make that decision? 

02:21:50
ANNIE Well we came uhm, because my husband's job. 

02:21:55
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

02:21:55
ANNIE He had a better offer here so we came here. And he had some family here too, you know? So, uhm, yeah. He has uh, his parents are here and his brother is here. And his sister's in California. 

02:22:10
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. So it sounds like it wasn't even a, a dilemma so much. He got a job here and uhm- 

02:22:25
ANNIE Yeah. It just made sense. You know? 

02:22:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG I'm getting a sense of what brought you in. what were your hopes in coming in? What were you hoping to get out of today? 

02:22:40
ANNIE I didn't really want to come in actually. Uhm, my friend Lauren made me come. She's one of my classmates and she was worried about me because she hasn't seen me in class the last three or four weeks. 

02:22:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:22:50
ANNIE And so basically she was so annoying. Uhm, she wouldn't stop calling and came by my house. So I just sort of came basically to get her off my back. 

02:23:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. So, now that you're here, do you have, do you have any hopes? It sounds like even coming in here was really uhm, you know, she had asked you to and so you kind of went along and took her advice. And now that we're here and we're talking about some of this, do you have any hopes if you were to come back? Or even- 

02:23:30
ANNIE I don't know. I may, I think I'll get over it, you know? And I think that in time, you know, things will be okay. And it's I mean, ideally if it was the right time, then I'd like to have continued with school. Because even though it's hard, I like it. I mean I really like it. 

02:23:55
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:23:55
ANNIE Like, I'm thinking about things that I've never had to think about in high school. 

02:24:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:24:05
ANNIE Yeah, and talking to people about you know, different ideas and some of the projects have been really fun to work on. So, yeah. And so, I think, you know, my friend Lauren sees how much I like it. 

02:24:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:24:20
ANNIE Uhm, she doesn't understand why you know, why I don't finish it. But she doesn't understand because she's not, it's, she has a different culture. 

02:24:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:24:35
ANNIE And she's really independent. 

02:24:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Right. 

02:24:35
ANNIE She does what she wants. But I can't do that. Right? Because it's not just me. So, yeah. 

02:24:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG How much of this have you shared with your husband, just how you're feeling and, and how you've been. Even just what's it been like to transition back to not going to school? 

02:25:05
ANNIE He doesn't get it. And he's just kind of annoyed, you know? And he's not really listening so I don't, I don't bother to tell him about it. I know he doesn't like me going to school because I'm not home. And he's worried about me when I'm out or when I'm not home by the time that he's home. 

02:25:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:25:25
ANNIE You know? And he doesn't like Lauren. He doesn't like Lauren. 

02:25:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG How come? 

02:25:35
ANNIE She's very opinionated too. He's very opinionated too. 

02:25:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG I mean I'm hearing that some of the values that has really helped you move along in life and go through different transitions is to really consider your partner at times, your family, you know, taking care of your brother, uhm, when the family's needed it. And kind of putting, putting, putting forward more of the family uhm, first. 

02:26:05
ANNIE Right. Yeah. But that's, that's what you're supposed to do. You know, because it's what's good for the family, I think. So-. 

02:26:35
[sil.] 

02:26:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG You look sad when you're saying that. 

02:26:40
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

02:26:50
[sil.] 

02:26:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Can you talk a little bit about that sadness that comes out? 

02:27:00
[sil.] 

02:27:05
ANNIE Just, I don't know, it's just hard, you know? Uhm, not like getting what you want sometimes? But I understand that though, you know? Because you can't, you can't always have what you want, especially if it's at the expense of other people, you know? So- 

02:27:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG So you'd feel unappreciative if you were to ask for what you wanted? 

02:27:30
ANNIE I guess. Yeah. I think that would be the worst, to be unappreciative, you know? I'd feel so guilty. Yeah. 

02:28:00
[sil.] 

02:28:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Is that what you think your husband would think if you said you wanted to go to school? 

02:28:05
ANNIE Well, he definitely doesn't want me to go. So, and it would, yeah, it would be my fault if uhm, you know, if we don't have kids now and what if we have kids later and there's something wrong with the child. It would be my fault. You know? And if I'm not home and they get into trouble, like an accident happens, it'd be my fault, because I'm not there. 

02:28:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG And you're taking on a lot of responsibility. That's a lot of pressure. 

02:28:45
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

02:28:55
[sil.] 

02:29:00
ANNIE You know I think if I, if I had a chance to do it over again, I'd just get my degree. It'd be really cool. It'd be cool. I'd do some more travelling, do some travelling. That'd be really great. 

02:29:20
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Well, I guess, I guess I'm, I am hearing what's really important to you, and, and what it would mean for you to start a family now. And given some of the pressures and some of your values and peers and uhm, and I guess I also want to offer you some hope then. Because I'm also hearing you closing that door. 02:29:50]Like oh well. I wish I did it, but I can't and that opportunity is completely gone. Uhm, and life is long. Longer than we sometimes think it is. Uh, and and there are lots of different ways that it can be done, even if it were after children. 

02:30:15
ANNIE Yeah, but I don't want to be, I don't want to be like you know, a 60 year old student. That'd be awkward. That'd be too embarrassing. 

02:30:25
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Well, I don't think you're going to have children until you're 60. 

02:30:30
ANNIE Oh, I know, but, but, you know, I don't want to be leaving them until like they're adults and they're, you know? 

02:30:40
[sil.] 

02:30:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Can you tell me why it's been difficult to talk to your husband about how you've been feeling? 

02:30:50
ANNIE He doesn't really want to, usually want to hear it, you know? And when we get into these arguments he's very, he's very accusatory. You know? But he makes sense. You know, like I'm not, I, I hate getting into arguments with him because I'm not a fast thinker. And in those moments I just like, I feel like an idiot. And he just could just, sort of, out-argue me. You know? And I don't really know how to explain to him why I want to do it. So how I can get him to understand if I can't explain it to him? I can't make the case for it. You know? So- 

02:31:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Do you want him to understand you more, even if it's not about making your case? 

02:31:45
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:31:45
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:31:50
ANNIE Yeah. But he's, it's, he's not, I don't think he do that though. He's not that type of person. You know? He's not, he's not easy going as I am. He, he wants what he wants, which is great because then-. It's great sometimes not having to make that choice, to make decisions, you know? 

02:32:15
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:32:20
ANNIE So I guess I've always just, you know, just went along with it. It was just, it was just a lot easier. 

02:32:30
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Sounds like that's been a coping strategy for you, as sometimes just kind of going with the, with the flow a little bit. 

02:32:35
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:32:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG And not, not to push against. 

02:32:40
ANNIE It's just a lot easier. 

02:32:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:32:45
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. 

02:32:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Does that feel familiar? The kind of going with the flow? 

02:32:55
ANNIE Yeah. Very familiar. Yeah. 

02:33:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG What were some of the expectations your parents had of you in terms of how you were uhm, growing up and I guess, just hearing when you say go with the flow. I'm wondering what were some of the expectations your parents had of you? 

02:33:20
ANNIE You know, just to help out at home, you know because they both had to work. So, you know, I'm the oldest and I'm a girl. So I had to do you know, the housework, uhm, looking after my brother, you know? And then going to school of course. And then you know, if, getting a job, getting a, going to school, finishing my academic job and getting married, having kids. That's it. 

02:33:50
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG That's a lot of flow to go with. 

02:33:55
ANNIE Yeah, but it's just the natural order of things, right? So it's what everyone does. 

02:34:05
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Uh, when you say the natural order of things, is that what you mean? That everybody kind of does this? 

02:34:10
ANNIE Yeah. Uhm, yeah. Yeah. 

02:34:15
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Within your cultural context. 

02:34:15
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. I mean I think it's lucky of me that I don't have to work, right? How many, you know, that I don't have to go to school and I don't have to work? How many women are just allowed to stay home and not have to go to work? Or have to go to school and deal with papers and bosses, you know? Because I can just stay home and take care of the house. I think that's pretty lucky. 

02:34:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Well, I think for women who really, really want that, that is really lucky, who are really happy in that role. 

02:34:50
ANNIE Yeah, so yeah. 

02:35:00
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG I'm hearing that it's kind of mixed for you though. 

02:35:05
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:35:10
[sil.] 

02:35:10
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:35:15
[sil.] 

02:35:20
ANNIE But, it's-, I'll get over it. You know, I'll get over it. It's sad, but I'll get over it. 

02:35:35
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Well, I'm curious uh, now that we've, yet there's just a few minutes left in our time together. And I know your, your friend was the one who urged you to come in and uhm, and you did. And I appreciate that even though it's been really difficult that you shared and you shared you know, openly and uhm, I guess I wonder how it was for you to come in and talk about family and your feelings and- 

02:36:10
ANNIE It was kind of strange, you know, I don't really talk about it. Uhm, yeah, I don't really talk about feelings. We don't do that in our family. And, I don't think we know how. So it's kind of uh, it's actually, it's been kind of nice talking about it. And it, I didn't realize that I'm so emotional about it. 

02:36:45
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Yeah. 

02:36:45
ANNIE So it's kind of nice. I do feel better than when I came in. I was kind of frustrated when I came in. I was kind of angry at Lauren for making me come. 

02:36:55
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Sounds like you've not had a lot of opportunities in your life to really sit down and think about what, what you want, or how you're feeling, which in some ways I'm also hearing that it's, that's part of, you know, the culture and some of the values. 

02:37:15
ANNIE Right. 

02:37:15
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG That your family has these prescribed kind of roles and things you do and so there's, you know, you haven't had to question too much. Uhm, and that's worked out in a large part for you. But now you're feeling, now I'm also sensing there's some uhm, other emotions coming up. Right? 

02:37:40
ANNIE Yeah. It's fine when I'm with you know, my husband. But when I'm alone, I think that's when it's hardest. Because just things just goes on in my head, you know? I think that's when I get sad. But when I'm, when I'm with people, I'm actually pretty happy. 

02:38:05
[sil.] 

02:38:10
ANNIE So I just, I just have to stop being, being alone. 

02:38:15
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Well, I'm wondering given uhm, you know, I guess where I was going originally with it was also you came here at the, kind of, persuasion of your friend. And I'm wondering if this is a place you would like to come to again to just talk and share your feelings? 

02:38:40
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:38:40
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG And if that feels like it would be a good fit for you? 

02:38:40
ANNIE Yeah, it's-, I do feel better talking to you afterwards. 

02:38:45
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. 

02:38:45
ANNIE So, yeah. 

02:38:45
DOCTOR AGNES KWONG Okay. Well, I would look forward to that. 

02:38:50
ANNIE Thanks, likewise. 

02:38:55

5 "Forces" of Counseling and Psychotherapy The Multicultural Counseling Session 

02:38:55
Processing the 5 Approaches to Psychotherapy with the Client Manivong J. Ratts, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Seattle University and Annie, the client 

02:39:15
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Hi Annie, how are you? 

02:39:15
ANNIE Hi Vong. Good thanks. And you? 

02:39:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS I'm really good. Thank you. Uhm, well I just want to say thank you for uh, being able to work with each of our five therapists you've had an opportunity to work with Doctor Sheri Hunt, who was really operating from a psychoanalytic perspective. Uhm, Katherine Nordell, who was working as a CBT therapist, uh, demonstrating the elements of CBT. And you also had an opportunity to work with Steven Scheutz who worked uh, from an existential humanistic paradigm. Uhm, Doctor Agnes Kwong, who was working from a multicultural framework and then uh, the last therapist you worked with was Doctor Michael Hutchins, who was operating from a social justice framework. 

02:40:00
ANNIE Right. 

02:40:00
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS And what I wanted to do today was just spend some time with you just sort of to process each of those sessions uhm, and if, just sort of hear from you in terms of what you liked, didn't like about your work with each of the therapists and, and what resonated with you. Uhm, is that okay? 

02:40:20
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. 

02:40:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS If we can start with the psychoanalytic perspective. That was the first therapist you worked with, Doctor Sheri Hunt. Uhm, what was your experience like uhm, as a client working with her? If you can share a little bit. 

02:40:35
ANNIE I felt really enlightment. Uhm, I know when I was telling my story she just drew so many connections uhm, from my childhood and how that uhm, plays out into how I'm currently acting. Uhm, so in that moment when I was sitting with her, she made so much sense. And it felt very like, yes. Yes, yes. You know? Everything she says makes so much sense. Uhm, and I just felt, like there was such a groove going on. Uhm, it felt, it felt really enlightening. 

02:41:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Sounds like a lot of, you were gaining a lot of insight. 

02:41:15
ANNIE Right. Right. But then, you know, after, after the session, and having time to think about it and process it, I felt very, I felt like I couldn't really say no because the connection she was making made so much sense. But then, it just felt a bit, it felt, because it makes so much sense but it didn't feel pinpoint. Does that make sense? Uhm, 

02:41:55
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Help me understand that. 

02:41:55
ANNIE Uhm, the, yeah, the connection just made a lot of sense, however, you know when I went on and processed it, I'm like, well, it could, it could have been this. It could have been that. Uhm, so I felt like the conclusions were kind of assumed, but maybe not accurate, if that makes sense. But at the moment when I was with her, she made a lot of sense, you know? So, uhm, it was really, it was really enlightening. Uhm, but I do wonder about uhm, the accuracy of it. 

02:42:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Okay. 

02:42:35
ANNIE Yeah, and she just seemed so knowledgeable that it was kind of hard to like, you know? But I don't know. But she seemed so knowledgeable. And was drawing so many connections and so fast. And as I was telling my story I was very, there's a lot of stuff going on inside, you know? So I felt like it just made sense, everything she connected. And I couldn't sit down and filter it and process her uhm, connections. But at the moment it felt like the flow was so good. So it just felt like yes, yes, yes. 

02:43:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah, it sounds like, what I hear you saying is you really connected with her, during the session. You liked the insight she was giving you. 

02:43:15
ANNIE Right. 

02:43:15
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Because it made a lot of sense, logical sense. 

02:43:20
ANNIE Right. 

02:43:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS In terms of connecting with the, your life story, if you will. And I hear you saying also at the same time, you liked her expertise and knowledge, uhm, that she brought into, into the session. Uhm, I'm also hearing you say in a sense, you wonder if, if maybe needing more time is important to be able to make sure these connections she's making, these insights are, are accurate. 

02:43:45
ANNIE Right. 

02:43:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS If I'm hearing you correctly. 

02:43:50
ANNIE Yes. 

02:43:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Uhm, once you went outside of the session and just sort of had time to process it a little bit more. 

02:43:55
ANNIE Right. 

02:43:55
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. 

02:43:55
ANNIE Right. 

02:44:00
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS How about the cognitive behavioral therapist, Katherine Nordell? 

02:44:05
ANNIE Right. Yeah, I really, I really felt like we had a really-. It felt, our relationship felt more equal. Uhm- 

02:44:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Than the first one? 

02:44:10
ANNIE Right, than with Doctor Hunt. Uhm, it felt more equal. Uhm, but I felt like, she focused a lot on of course, on my thoughts and my feelings. Uhm, and it, it, I didn't feel as listened to. Uhm, it just felt like there was a sort of a pattern or a path she wanted to drive me to. uhm, because I, I feel that my story is so much more. Uhm, and it felt, it felt kind of narrow. 

02:44:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Okay. Okay. Sounds like you're saying you felt like she had a direction that she wanted to take you. 

02:44:50
ANNIE Right. Right. 

02:44:55
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Uhm, and, and that felt limiting. 

02:44:55
ANNIE Right. 

02:44:55
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS But at the same time I'm hearing you say you felt the relationship was more egalitarian. 

02:45:00
ANNIE Right. 

02:45:05
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Uhm, you were equals, in, in, in your work together, if you will compared to with Doctor Hunt. 

02:45:10
ANNIE Right. 

02:45:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Uhm, anything else you like about your work with Nordell, Katherine Nordell? 

02:45:20
ANNIE Uhm, yeah. I just think that we had a really rapport, I think. I really trusted her. Uhm, yeah, I think that's the thing that sticks out the most, the rapport we had with each other. And I felt yeah, I just felt it was really equal. 

02:45:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Okay. 

02:45:35
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:45:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS How about with Steven Scheutz, the therapist who was operating from an existential/humanistic paradigm? What was that experience like for you? 

02:45:45
ANNIE Uhm, I, I felt kind of confused with the whole experience because the questions he asked, to me, didn't make much sense for me to do certain things. Uhm, and I felt like it was about me, me, me. And I understand that therapy is about me, but there's so many other things going on, like my family, my husband, that to focus only on me and not bring them into the equation, it felt kind of silly. Not silly, but uhm, yeah, it was, it just wasn't uhm, because I can't just think about me. You know, I can't just focus on me. There's other people, you know, near me. Uhm, so it felt like, like uhm, it felt like that he couldn't really- to what I was going through. I remember the one, the one question about uhm, don't forget I'm going to get the, the slushy question. Uhm, you know, I feel like that's not, that's not me. That's not what I would do. Uhm, and it seemed a bit strange to ask that question. And it seemed kind of irrelevant with the stuff going on. Yeah. But however, I did like, I think it was him, uhm, where he said that, you know, that this is a safe space for you, for you to feel your uhm, to say what you want and feel your emotions. Because I think he's the one who said that. Yeah, uhm, I really appreciated that. Because I didn't realize that this is what this space is for. 

02:47:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So you like the fact that he was able to set that tone for you. Uhm, but I also hear you saying one of the limitations that you had was you didn't feel like he truly connected with you. 

02:47:35
ANNIE Right. 

02:47:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Kind of really understood you as uhm, an Asian American in terms of just looking at your family dynamics and focusing more so on sort of you as an individual. 

02:47:50
ANNIE Right. Right. Which I'm hearing you say is a limited perspective of who you are in relation to your experience. 

02:48:00
ANNIE Right. It felt, it felt really Western. Uhm, yeah. It felt really Western. 

02:48:05
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS It's interesting because with Katherine you were talking about how it seemed like there was more direction or she kind of knew where she was going. Uhm, and, and there was a logical sequence- 

02:48:15
ANNIE Yes. 

02:48:15
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS In terms of her work with you. And with Steven, what I'm hearing you say if I'm hearing you correctly is that there wasn't necessarily that logical progression of, of what you were doing. 

02:48:30
ANNIE Right. 

02:48:30
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Is that-? Did you feel that? 

02:48:30
ANNIE Yeah. It felt very much like bouncing back and forth. 

02:48:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Okay. 

02:48:35
ANNIE The questions that were asked. Uhm, because I know uhm, there was some frustration because of the way I answered the questions. Uhm, I couldn't answer the questions the way he wanted me to answer it. And I can sense that he was kind of frustrated. Uhm, because I couldn't see what he wanting me to see. Uhm, so I felt he was repeating a lot of things, repeating a lot of questions in a different way, to sort of get me to an answer that he wants me to see. Uhm, yeah. So it didn't feel logical. It just felt sort of circular and like a tennis ball back and forth, back and forth. 

02:49:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is interesting because existential humanistic theorists and practitioners tend to be, are known to be directionless in terms of just just non-directive. 

02:49:25
ANNIE Right. 

02:49:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS In their approach and cognitive behaviorists uh, tend to be a little bit more uh, uh, structured in their work with clients and it's interesting that you pointing that out. 

02:49:35
ANNIE Oh, okay. 

02:49:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Or that you're experiencing that. 

02:49:40
ANNIE Oh cool. 

02:49:40
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So, how about with uh, Doctor Agnes Kwong. The, the, uh, multicultural therapist? 

02:49:45
ANNIE I honestly must say that I felt the most listened to with her. I felt the pacing was equal. I just the pacing was really good. I just felt really listened to. And I felt like she had no agenda. Uhm, and she just listened. So, yeah, I think the pacing- 

02:50:10
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS What were things she was doing that made you feel connected or that you were feeling listened to? Were there things in the session that was happening? 

02:50:20
ANNIE I think a lot of it is body language. You know? Uhm, yeah. It's just the way maybe she says Mmm hmm, you know? Uhm, I can't pinpoint, I can't remember any exact phrases. 

02:50:35
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. 

02:50:40
ANNIE But just, I just felt listened to. Just the simple maybe verbal and facial responses. Yeah, I just felt really listened to, listened with her. Uhm, yeah. 

02:50:55
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Did you feel that uh, her uhm, racial identity sort of uhm, helped in terms of you connecting with her? Or have an influence in your ability to connect with her? The fact that you were both Asian females? 

02:51:10
ANNIE I think maybe. But I'm not quite sure, because I felt, I feel more equal with uhm, Katherine. 

02:51:20
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Okay. 

02:51:20
ANNIE In terms of like, just personality and uhm, not personality but like, just equal. But with Nancy, with Doctor Kwong, she's so, a little more knowledgeable than I am. But still there's still that sense of like, caring, I guess. So, I don't know exactly what it is that made me feel that way with her. I'm not quite sure if it is our similar cultural identity. I'm not quite sure. 

02:51:50
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. What was your experience like with Doctor Michael Hutchins. He was really operating from a social justice framework and did something a little bit different. 

02:52:00
ANNIE Right. 

02:52:00
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Than the other therapists. 

02:52:00
ANNIE Yeah, he did stuff I didn't know that counseling do. Uhm, and I like that he thought outside the box and helped me, you know, find resources and other options. Uhm, so that part I really uhm, liked because I saw a bigger picture of what counseling can do. But similar to CBT, it felt very uhm, directed. Uhm, I just felt I was answering questions back and like-. I just, I was just constantly answering questions. I didn't feel like, I didn't feel like he really knew me. I just felt like I just kept answering the questions that he had for me. So- 

02:52:45
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Yeah. Well now that you've had an opportunity to work with all five therapists, if there was a therapist you were going to uh, uh, continue working with, who might that be? 

02:52:55
ANNIE Uhm, I think personally, I think I'm a better fit with Doctor Kwong. Uhm, Doctor Kwong? Uhm, and perhaps it is because we're the same uhm, same culture, background. Uhm, I just felt, it's the fact that I felt really listened to. I felt like she saw me and she heard me. I felt like she didn't rush me. And I think that the directions the other counselors went I think if I had more time with her, she would have gone those directions also. Uhm, and it was only our first session. Uhm, yeah. So I'd like to think that you know, if we had more time, we would have gone-, because she did ask a bit about my childhood, Uhm, like, uhm, Doctor Hunt. And she did ask me about stuff I was thinking and feeling, like uhm, Katherine uhm, uhm. Yeah, so- 

02:53:55
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS So she kind of brought elements of other theories, you felt, in your work with her. 

02:54:00
ANNIE Right. Right. 

02:54:05
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Or in her work with you. 

02:54:05
ANNIE Right. 

02:54:05
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS She had a little bit of everything. 

02:54:05
ANNIE I think so. 

02:54:05
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS And then that cultural piece it sounds like was important for you. 

02:54:10
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. So I think, and it was only one session. So I think that more sessions uhm, we could have gotten all the other stuff out perhaps. Uhm, but yeah, the most important thing I just felt really listened to. 

02:54:25
DOCTOR MANIVONG RATTS Well, I just want to thank you for your time and for uhm, giving of yourself and sharing your, your uh, experiences with each of the therapists. I really appreciate it. And I know students who watch this video will as well. So, thank you. 

02:54:40
ANNIE Great. Thank you. You're welcome.
