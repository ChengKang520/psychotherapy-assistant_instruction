UNKNOWN Welcome. Thank you. Thank you for being here. This is a topical panel about couples and family therapy and we are privileged to have three of the, the most esteemed leaders in this field here with us today. I would like to introduce Dr. John Gottman, Dr. Julie Gottman, and Cloé Madanes, all of whom have made very significant contributions to, to this field. And it should be a really dynamic in the interest in panel. There has not been a lot of preparations so there is a lot of spontaneous, uhm, comments between them, discussion. Uhm, I have invited them to let us know what commonalities and what differences they have discovered or encountered in the way they approach family and couples therapy. But overall, the-- I think if we're just here to learn a little bit of the-- their basic philosophy about how to work with the couples and family therapy. So with that, I'll turn it over to the panel.

00:01:25
CLOÉ MADANES All right. They're forcing me to start. Okay. 

00:01:30
JULIE GOTTMAN She's the smart one. 

00:01:35
CLOÉ MADANES All right. So, uhm, I, I want to give you some of the guiding principles of, uhm, my approach to family and couples therapy. And then I'll try to point out some similarities and differences with the Gottman's. So, ah, the, the first important principle is that this is an approach where we believe in self-determination. We don't believe in predetermination of any kind, that there is always a choice to be made. So whatever a person's situation, we will not attribute it to their chemistry, ah, their genes, ah, their brain, their parents, their childhood. No matter what the difficulties and their obstacles, there's always a choice and there's always a-- the possibility of having a better life and we believe that that is the task of the therapist, is to orient people and guide people towards the idea that they are in charge of their destiny, that they're not predetermined in any way. It was interesting because when the field of family therapy started, it was very much against the concepts of segue. Now this is in the idea that everything was determined in the first few years of life. And then, I saw a family therapy begin with some kind of predetermination in terms of the dynamics in the family so the social context determine the individual. And it's true. We believe that the most efficient and fastest way of changing an individual is to change their social context, their relationships, the people with whom they interact, their significant others who are usually the family, sometimes it's the workplace or the school. But that all of a sudden became another form of determinism where the social context was determining the, the individual. And so we have to be very careful not to fall in to that determinism again. The fact that intervening in the social context makes it easier to change an individual doesn't mean that the individual is determined by forces outside of himself. All right. Ah, so personal responsibility together with this is a hugely important concept. We hold people accountable for how they treat themselves and how they treat others. This is a basic principle. The family therapy related to my presentation earlier today because-- and you realize the importance of this when you're working with problems of violence. So it's very important to attribute individual responsibility. When a crime is committed, somebody did it. It's not something that happened and that it was a whole group that committed the crime. Action. My therapy is a therapy of action. We believe that no matter how much you talk to someone, change doesn't really happen until the person does something different. So we encourage people to action. It's not just about talking on. Although talking is very valuable of course. Uhm, the, the directive. Uhm, the directive is the main tool that we use in the therapy. So we ask people to do certain things in the session, out of the session, between sessions with each other. And directives can be direct or indirect. So a direct metaphor is, for example, I'd like you to help your son with your homework. And indirect, uhm, directive could be talking in metaphor about, uhm, an animal that was helping another animal. Whatever, whatever metaphor you want to create so that in your story, and this is very Ericksonian, Ericksonian love to give those kinds of directives, he would just tell the story and the story that might have been about a plant in the desert contained an indirect suggestion about what the client could do. Uhm, this is not a neutral approach. We believe that you cannot be neutral in therapy because people have huge possibility of arming each other or healing each other. And so we have to take a position that is ethical and moral about what is right and wrong and so we're very aware about the human rights of children, and this is a big part of my therapy because I've worked so much with cases of violence and abuse and so on that, ah, to defend children's rights in, in terms not only of the family but of the greater social context it's very important to me. So I've had cases for example where I threatened the judge in the case because I thought the judge-- I didn't-- it wasn't that I thought the judge was making these issues that were really abusing a child. Then if any of you is interested in reading about, this is a chapter in my book six, Love and Violence. Uhm, spirituality is an important concept and important part of the work again because of my work with violence. Because I'm not a particularly spiritual person in the sense that I don't really practice any religion and I don't think of myself as particularly spiritual. But I came to it through understanding the pain that people experience when people harm each other. And so through the experience of the pain of the victim and the pain of the victimizer, ah, I came to realize that there's a certain kind of pain that is more than physical and more than emotional, that it's spiritual. And, and if we don't understand that, we cannot help the people that have suffered that. And it's not just in my work with abusing families. It's because I'm Argentinian and we had, ah, 20,000 disappeared people in Argentine and we had torture and persecutions, some of which I experience myself. And so I came to understand this from, from that point of view, from the point of view of White human beings are capable of doing to each other and the pain that, that results. Ah, another important concept is the family as a self-help group. Self-help groups are very important in our culture groups like AA, the feminist movement and so on. Well, I think that the family is the ultimate self-help group because the family is the institution in society that exists solely for the protection of each other and for helping each other. That's the purpose of the family. And so when I gather a family together, I make it very clear that we're here to help one another, they're here to help one another, and I'm just to facilitate therefore how they're going to help and heal each other. I'm losing track of the time here. Okay, I still have a few minutes. Uhm, I think it's important to understand that, ah, we need to have a plan for our relationships. If we don't make a plan for our lives, somebody else will and so we, we encourage people to make a plan for what they want their life to be like six months from now, a year from now, five years from now because, uhm, it's, it's interesting to think how people can plan ahead in ways that are sometimes unfortunate. I like to tell very quickly that it's, it's C.S. Lewis story, the famous biologist about, uhm, a little bug, the mimosa girdler, that when it's born it begins to hunt for a mimosa tree. It's a Japanese tree that exist in Texas. When it finds the tree, the little bug climbs up the tree, finds a weak limb, lays its eggs on the branch then nibbles around the branch until the first wind will break the branch and he'll fall in the ground and he'll begin to rot providing the perfect environment for the eggs to hatch. And then the little bug disappears, we don't know where it goes. But if a little bug can have a complex behavior like this in finding a particular tree and doing this whole process, imagine how a child can plan to get the parents to stay together, for example, and not divorce or to bring attention to himself so the-- to pre-- so as to prevent the concern about something else. So being aware of the protectiveness of family members towards each other particularly of children towards their parents is crucially important in understanding families so that we can provide better ways of protecting each other. Very often the problems that are presented in families are children that are out of control, children, adolescence, young adults, drug addicts, delinquent, out of control, mentally ill, and very often the function of these, these problems are protective of other family members. So I was in a panel yesterday with Harriet Lerner that was talking about how when she was, ah, 12 years old her mother was dying of cancer and she began to fail in school and to commit delinquent acts, minor delinquent acts, but still delinquent acts because she heard several times the mother say on the phone to her friends, "I can't die because Harriet is a mess." And so Harriet remembers consciously, ah, having problems to keep her mother alive. Her mother lived until the of age 94 or something. And Harriet did have to do the problems all the time. So being aware of the indirect ways that people protect each other is very important. And I think-- okay, okay. I have-- I've gone for 30 minutes, I'm sorry. Okay. No, I haven't. We started at 9:20. 

00:12:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Oh, you're right. Keep going. 

00:12:55
CLOÉ MADANES All right. A couple of more. Yeah, just a minute more. Ah, some... 

00:13:00
JULIE GOTTMAN I thought we started at nine. 

00:13:00
CLOÉ MADANES No, no, 9:20. 

00:13:00
JULIE GOTTMAN More, more. 

00:13:00
CLOÉ MADANES Okay. So then very important to understand that the family is a hierarchical organization where some people are in charge of others. And typically, in Corvette hierarchy parents are in charge of children. Grandparents are in an advisory capacity. But sometimes this hierarchy gets confused. And, ah, often, the work of the therapist is to restore the proper hierarchy. Uhm, and one can do this in direct or indirect ways. I have used strategies where we put the children deliberately in charge of the parents' happiness. Just so to exaggerate the opposite situation in the family of what it could be and then the family we organize is if we have time later I'll tell the story about that because it's one of my most interesting strategies. So a phenomenon that is typical in, uhm, in family therapy is that you find that there are cross generation coalitions where for example one parent sides with the child against the other parent. Or a parent sides with the grandparent against the spouse. And these are situations that we have to correct and we have to-- we have a variety of strategies for doing this. But one last thing that I want to emphasize is that my approach is not on orthodoxy. We take from every other approach whatever works. So, uhm, I, I probably in a few-- it, it would take me just a few minutes to remember about 70 or 80 strategies of therapy that we use and some of them come from individual therapy, some are from psychoanalysis, behaviors-- behavioral schools, we use all of the Gottman strategies. Uhm, because we incorporate whatever works. So this, this is not a school of thought where we say, "Oh, no, that is wrong." If it works, it's wonderful. It's, it's the right thing to do. And also therapists have different personalities, different styles, different backgrounds, different cultures. And, ah, therapist needs to pick what feels comfortable to them what they feel that they can do successfully and that is useful. Okay. That's right. Thank you. No, it's, it's okay. It's okay. 

00:15:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Now is, now is... 

00:15:45
JOHN GOTTMAN I wanted to make a few comments about, ah, the history of, ah, couples and family therapy and I, I remember when I was in graduate school and, and, ah, it came to this, came to this conference that, uhm, it seemed like, you know, there were these masters of therapy that got wheeled out. A lot of, a lot of it was-- it seemed like it was sort of wheeling out the old dinosaurs so we could see them before they died, you know. Uhm, we had read about them in the textbooks. And, and they were-- you know, they had this magic about, ah, ah, how to do therapy and, and we all watched them, watched them do therapy or watched tapes of them doing therapy and, and try to glean what the magic is. I think we're in the new era, ah, of couples and family therapy where, ah, we therapists aren't, aren't doing anything magical. We're, we're really basing what we do as couples and families on research. And, ah, and research takes a long time. It's a-- and it-- ah, it's really painstaking and slow. But, but it's been, it's been very effective and, and it seems like we now we have methods that really aren't magical. They're really, they're really pretty are learnable, they're, you know, they're-- uhm, they're the kinds of things that, you know, sensitive therapist like, like you guys are can learn and do and really, ah, have hopes that you'll be really very effective between 70 and 80% of the time. Not that we've solved all the problems, but because we've really have based research on a very simple idea. And Don Meichenbaum talked about this when we talked about, uhm, the predominant reaction to, to trauma is res-- resilience. And, you know, there-- and studying resilience helps you to know and to help people who really aren't so resilient. All right, and to understand those processes. And that's really what has, what has guided off my work is there are some people who really know how to do this relationship thing, how to do this parenting thing. And, and we've just studied them and compared them to the people who really have trouble with relationships and parenting. And there are very systematic differences and they're not very complicated. And when you base a therapy on those differences and, ah, and not only create the therapy based upon just research findings but based the therapy on, ah, what it is that we clinicians know when we connect with couples. Because the clinical world is as important a laboratory as the psychological laboratory. And when you put those two things together, you're going to have getting therapies that actually work very well and have very little relapse and they're very learnable. And the same thing is true for parenting, for working, working with families, working with children. We understand so much more than we did 50 years ago about children's peer relationships, their emotional development, ah, what babies need, what fetal development is like, how, how the family system really relates to one another. So now I think we're in new era of, of therapy, ah, where there's a remarkable convergence in, ah, attachment theory based approaches to, to families and adult relationships and children's relationships and, and more broadly in the attachment theory, ah, you know, a real empirical approach to understanding what families and couples are all about. What-- and you know, what it is about them that functions well. What processes are important? And what, what goes array when they're not functioning well? So we don't need the magicians. You know, the therapist who seemed to have some hidden magic. Ah, the processes are clear. Ah, we know a lot about love. We know about how to maintain it, how to nurture it, and what happens when it goes wrong? So I think we're in a new place. Ah, and I think it's a very place exciting place. Not that we know everything about, there's really a need for a lot more research as well. But we now know how to, how to do therapy with families and with couples and, and also it help children develop, ah, in a healthy way. We know about emotions. We know about cognitive development, and brain, and how these things are related, emotional development, cognitive development, and social development. And, ah, and now we have the, the basic science that can make a real difference, and the clinical wisdom that can make a real difference. That's all I want to say. 

00:20:35
[sil.] 

00:20:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah. That's great, sweetie. Uhm, that's my cue. He's so smart. So, okay. Uhm, how do I follow these two stellar people? Uhm, you know, John speaks very, ah, modestly about his contribution. But what I want you to know is that he looked at over 3,000 couples 100th of a second by 100th of a second. While they were having conflict discussions, while they were having end of the day, "How was your day, dear?" discussions, while they were sitting in an apartment, uhm, that was just like a B&B except that it had cameras bolted to the walls and one way mirrors and they're collected, etcetera. But just like a B&B. What were these couples actually doing? So, you know, we, we both knew that you know, based on our history of relationships there was no way in hell that we were gonna be taking our experience and knowledge and putting it into clinical work. We have to really look at the experts. Who were the masters of relationship? And that's what we were doing in our research, comparing the masters of relationship with the disasters. And we came out as John said with this very clear predictive factors about what sustained relationships and also what cause their demise. At that point then, we were ready to begin to think about a theory of what the couples need in order to sustain happy and long lasting relationships. And we begin this process while sitting in a canoe in the middle of the Pacific Ocean which is a really great place to think. You know, there's no distraction, there's no phones. And so we created what we call the Sound Relationship House Theory and maybe because we were in the middle of the sea and figuring out how the world are we gonna get back. Then we came up with a really nice house on solid ground as our metaphor. So basically, you know, we found that there were seven things, just seven things that couples needed to be able to do. One was they needed to, ah, create good love maps for each other which has to do with the process of asking each other questions, questions about their inner world, questions about their needs, questions about their favorite priorities, their dreams, etcetera. Couples needed to be asking each other questions all the time. It's one of the things that builds friendship. Friendship. Romance, passion were also related to people feeling known. We also wanted to encourage admiration and fondness and the expression of those, absolutely crucial. People may feel it but they won't express it. So we worked on ways of helping couples be appreciative of one another and scan the horizon for what they were doing right, not just what they were doing wrong. We also found in the apartment lab that the tiny little ways the couples respond to each other as bits of connection. As you may have heard in our, ah, lecture on infidelity, it made a huge difference in terms of how close they felt to one another, how willing they were to be transparent with one another and really voice those needs. We looked at, did they give their partners the benefit of the doubt when their partners were crumby? You know, one of the things that-- ah, I guess it's been kind of a pet peeve of mind is that the vision of what is a good relationship is often idealized. It's you're supposed to heal all of your partner's wounds or you're supposed to be able to never have regrettable incidents or never lose it with your partner. And, you know, what we saw with our master couples is that that just isn't the way it works. You know, as we like to say if you have a good enough relationship where you can sit down, have a cup of coffee, and share a good pastry, and you're happy doing that, that's good enough. So we were really after creating the good enough relationship, not the perfect one. Cuz who's perfect in this room? Anybody? No. So, we also look of course at managing conflicts. So we dealt with friendship but also managing conflict. And what we saw with managing conflict was really interesting. We really had to study the masters here. What they did is they avoided criticism, they avoided contempt, defensiveness and stonewalling. And the interesting thing about stonewalling which is completely shutting down and not responding to your partner in the middle of a conflict, or it's that men usually were the ones who were stonewalling. And so the women felt punished, they felt shut out, they felt abandoned. But the reality for those men who were stonewalling, and incidentally there is women who do it too was that they were physiologically aroused, their heart rates sitting there gently talking to their partner just like this, their heart rates would be beating at a 140 beats per minute. You try and get your heart rate up that high, right? So fight or flight was going on. And we know that when people run fight or flight, everything feels like in an attack. So what these people were doing when they were stonewalling. It's a very natural response. They were trying to shut down the stimuli that was elevating their body physiology and making them feel like they were gonna have a heart attack. That's what they were doing, trying to calm themselves down by not taking in the stimuli that had gotten them there in the first place. Once that was explained to couples, then we understood and they understood that it was better to take a break, calm down, don't rehearse what you're gonna say, do something different to calm down that physiology then come back together, maybe an hour later in order to discuss the topic with calmness and we found that it made a huge difference. It was like somebody just had a brain transplant and come back into a conversation where they could now creatively problem solve. Speaking of problem solving, we found that 69% of all problems couples have are unsolvable. They never get solved. How about that? So when you think about-- you know, when we were looking in the lab actually, and couples were coming back year after year for as long as 20 years, they were discussing exactly the same topic with exactly the same points, only they change their hairstyle. We saw the mullet, all right. You know, we saw the bell-bottoms. Then we saw the, you know, princess die cuts. You know, it was-- but it was exactly the same conversation. Only, the masters were able to have dialogues about this that were full of humor, that were full of warmth, that had positive, ah, components to those conversations. And acceptance, so that the masters with this perpetual problems had a basic attitude which was this. You know, I love you so much. You are the most wonderful man or woman on the planet. You are so phenomenal. I totally think everything about you is perfect. But for God's sakes, would you please change? So we say. So, what we worked on also was the existential level. And I think, uhm, Cloé, this is also relevant to the spiritual level. That is the heart of the partners, where do they live inside? What gives their life purpose? What gives their life meaning? Is there a greater being that they believe in? What are their deepest values? There are a lot of couples who don't share that about themselves with one another. So it was very important to help couples to share at that level. And you know what we found in the midst of the deepest most horrific reedlike conflicts? When we took couples to that level, the underlying dream, the underlying belief, the underlying core need that they had relative to that conflict, by golly, the edge is softened. They became much more compassionate to one another. And then they could move towards compromise. If they didn't get to that level, there was no way they can do it. That was the secret. Finally, I think the last thing I wanna say is that, uhm, you know at work, we have a, a goal that maybe a little bit different, ah, for our therapy. And that is our goal is to make ourselves obsolete. That's our goal. And we do that by making the therapy as dyadic as possible. That means we are giving couples ways of talking with one another. Yes, we are giving them skills that they can take home, that they can try at home. We're giving them ways to process bad fights just with one another. We're giving them particular questions to ask each other in the midst of a terrible conflict in which they can really understand where the other person is coming from because profound understanding, the person's position must precede trying to solve it. It has to. So we give couples ways of having dialogues about that. We give couples alternative ways of speaking about their problems other than criticism content, defensiveness and stonewalling. We teach people how to self soothe their physiology. And of course, what we're also doing just as Cloé was pointing out is that we are borrowing the wisdom of so many other people who have preceded us and who sit right next to us. In terms of the work that they are doing that they have done, that bring in for example a psychodynamic approach. Understanding your internal self-criticism that often manifest as outward criticism. Understanding their enduring vulnerability is perhaps from childhood abuse and how they are still reacting to those in the context of the here and now their current relationship. So you know, to sum it up I guess, uhm, we're actually really continuing to learn every single day from the best teachers in the world and that is the couples and the children in front of us, so God bless them. Thank you. 

00:33:55
CLOÉ MADANES I would like to say something. Ah, two concepts that you mention that are especially important to me. One is the idea of attributing good intentions like to teach couples and families, parents to make their best effort to always attribute good intentions to the other person. If you do that, most of the family problems and couples problems can be solved. If you help people not to think he did it on purpose, he's mean, ah, rebellious, or whatever, he had good intentions. It didn't come out right, but the intention was good is a much better way. And then to helping people to find the meaning in life. That is crucial. That is ultimately our goal because a life without meaning is just a very difficult sad life to live. So we can consider that a therapy is not over unless the person has a purpose, a meaning something that they're going to pursue. But I have to take issue with John here because, uhm, I want to clarify whether I'm one of those dinosaurs or magicians. Because I've been in this conference since 1985 so I guess you were talking about me. I'm not a dinosaur or magician. 

00:35:30
JULIE GOTTMAN She certainly isn't, is she? 

00:35:35
CLOÉ MADANES But I want to, I want to add one thing. I think one of the differences between us that makes our relationship interesting here and that is important is that you come from a research perspective and I've spent most of my life behind the one way mirror trying to direct a therapist on the other side of the mirror who's working with a very difficult family couple, individual, whoever, and having to come with-- come up with some suggestion for what they could do to help those people who tend to be random people to just work in through the door, they're not part of the sand bar or anybody and that's how I spent most of my life. You know that there's research that shows that if you put chimpanzees in that situation the chimpanzee will have a nervous breakdown. And that's what I've done on my life. You speak about resiliency. 

00:36:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Yes. She, she is a magician. That's great. 

00:36:45
CLOÉ MADANES All right. 

00:36:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Do we take questions? 

00:36:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Let's take questions from the audience. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. That was a very interesting introduction and, ah, it showed not only the, the harmony and the way of, ah, of working-- that they're all working. Uhm, and even in, in conflict resolution, the, the cooperative venture was, was really illustrated very nicely. Uhm, the-- I would like to open the floor to questions. We have about 20 minutes remaining. And for those of you who have questions, please approach the microphone and we will, we will take questions, we will alternate the microphones there, there, and there. So go ahead. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Uhm, so, ah, I came here really excited because I'm trying to learn more and more about family therapy and, uhm, so I had a question for the Gottmans. Uhm, I hear a lot about how you use your approach with couples. Uhm, that's what your famous for. I'm wondering how you might use some of these approaches in the family that includes children that, uhm, I'm presenting with, you know, serious problems. Just any, any examples, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. 

00:37:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Sure. Uhm, one, ah, one of the things that we discovered, uhm, is that the relationship between parents is the same fabric as parent-child relationships. And this, this goes back to infancy and even the, even the last trimester of pregnancy. Uhm, so that the, uhm, the couple relationship really, uhm, reflects the way people parent. And again, there were masters and disasters of parenting. Uhm, the masters were emotion coaches. They're connected with, uhm, kids during moments when the children were emotional. And essentially, the research rediscovered the clinical work of Haim Ginott in the 1960's. And, ah, and, and really explicated five steps of emotion coaching. And it turns out that when, ah, parents do this emotion coaching, it predicts a very different launch into new trajectory for the children. They really do learn emotional intelligence. There is something like emotional intelligence. It's a real construct and it-- and the skills that make kids successful in different times in life especially with peers are very different in early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence and ear-- and the early adulthood. And the tasks are different. Ah, but emotion coaching, ah, really teaches the emotional intelligence and savvy and moxie that kids need. And it's turned out that, uhm, this is a pretty easy skill to teach parents. And, uhm, enroll to teachers in about their own emotions. So it opens, it opens a window into their own heart about their own feelings. And, ah, one of the things that's so amazing, ah, to last is that, you know, this research was done in, ah, Southern Illinois and, ah, and Seattle. And yet, ah, we've applied it in South Korea and other countries, and, ah, Australia, for example. The randomized clinical trial is really, you know, ah, testing whether this approach really does anything. And they've through than the most clinical trials in Australia and Melbourne, ah, by Sophie Havighurst. And, ah, and it's been applied in South Korea as well as emotion coaching training parents and teachers on how to relate the kids when they're emotional. And, ah, and the effects are really impressive. And kids are the same everyone in the planet. That's pretty amazing. So we, we really can, ah, teach people how to have a very different emotional life in their intimate relationships and in the way they love and understand their children. And it turns out the children then are impacted in their peer relations which is probably the most important place to look for healthy development in children, ah, their, their own relationships with their peers and how their change is over development. So that's another example. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, can I go ahead? I myself, I'm in my 70's and I find that I am now seeing people that are 70 or 80 or 90 because that has pertinence to me. I saw some before that, and certainly in my own family, I have people that are of those ages. But I find that whether your physical problem is diabetes, lupus, a bone problem, a heart problem. There are limits in your life and often it's hard to keep finding-- I can find my own joy, but to tell people about how to find their joy with limitations, I, I got frustrated finding out that there are many automatic doors here. It-- sometimes I get very mad. Ah, it's just-- I don't mean, it's just something that happens every day and I'm wondering how, how do you stop or how do you often the children, the grandchildren, your bestfriends, other people who wanna tell you how to live, how to be safe, or you should move out of your home, you should go to assisted living, ah, but you mean not wanna move it all. 

00:42:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhm, uhm, may I answer, ah, just a little bit of that question. Uhm, first of all, I congratulate you on your courage to bring up that question. I think it's a very important question. Uhm, and I think there are many people in their senior years, ah, who, ah, people somehow look at them as not having their own mind anymore. Ah, and trying to tell them how to live in naturally what you're describing. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:43:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhm, and so, ah, I like to tell family members, ah, who have elderly parents or perhaps or in relationships themselves, ah, in their older years that, ah, what people need as they face aging and the limitations that the years bring to them, what people really need more than anything else is to not feel alone. And the way that family members or others can help that person to feel less alone is listening, is seeing, putting themselves in the other shoes, expressing empathy, expressing compassion, asking questions that or essentially asking that elderly person. So what are you inside now, and how can I show you respect? How can I show you love? How can I understand your plot? As oppose to problem solving kind of broadcasting what they think is best, they need to understand that the elderly know better than anyone else just like every individual no matter what age knows better than anyone else, what their own needs are, what their own feelings are, what their own values are, and what their own solutions are. All we have to do is just listen. So thank you for letting us listen to you. 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. And that's it. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN So I'd like to take from this microphone. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Is it-- okay, ah, we, we all know that certain dysfunctional and any relationships could result in resentment and anger. And I wonder how-- when this anger manifests itself in the romantic relationship, uhm, it could undermine the capacity to introspect and see how much a person has, a person has a contribution to the conflict. Uhm, how would you address that? 

00:45:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Let, let me, let me say something about anger. Ah, cuz, ah, not everybody has the same attitude that we do about anger. And, uhm, and there's-- uhm, probably one of the most important, uhm, books written about anger is called the Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion by Carol Tavris because not only she's a journalist, ah, she has a PhD in psychology. She actually went to the library to read and research on anger. Anger is a healthy emotion. It's, ah, it's an approach emotion. Ah, and Richard Davidson's work at the University of Wisconsin shows that it's tends to be more localized in the left hemisphere, ah, along with other approached emotions like curiosity and interest. When we face our own anger or when we face our partner's anger, the most important thing that we can do, ah, especially facing our partner's anger is to really say, "Honey, what are your concerns?" you know, "What-- tell me, tell me what you're feeling, I wanna hear it." We need to embrace our partner's anger even if it's directed at us. Cuz anger is a very functional emotion as are all emotions. It has a purpose. It's usually a goal that's being blocked. As, ah, Jerry Clore and Andrew Ortony, ah, pointed out on their book on emotions. And so, ah, we need to embrace our partner's anger cuz all of the distressed relationships that we-- that I see in my office have left one another in pain for a long time. And the masters really say, "You know, honey, when you're hurt, the world stops and I listen." Anger is a very important emotion. It's, ah, often a reaction to injustice in the relationship, unfairness or, you know, frustrated dreams and goals and hopes and wishes. So within every so-called negative emotion there is a longing. And within that longing there is a recipe for success with that person and that's what you have to do with anger as well. It's not a dysfunctional emotion. 

00:47:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Let me just add one piece to that. A lot of people get, ah, ah, several things confused and merge together. They think anger is the same thing as criticism and contempt. Those are very different. Anger is a statement about yourself. You're describing yourself, you're not describing the other partner, you're describing yourself. I'm furious, about what? What's the situation you're angry about? I'm furious that the bills haven't been paid. As oppose to, "You're so irresponsible, what's the matter with you?" Which is a criticism and a blaming? So part of our work in therapy is to help people give voice to their anger and their feelings without using criticism and contempt which sabotages their getting listened to. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. Now, we can te-- we only have time for about two or three more questions. But-- oh, there, right, at the back microphone in this and this one will be after the other. So the back microphone. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. Uhm, thank you, uhm, all three of you for the wonderful, ah, information and pioneering you have done in this field, it's very, very much and has been needed. One of the things appoints to that I believe has been the increased divorce rate over the past 50 years at least within the American culture leaving a lot of single parenting families. And so, ah, I know Cloé, you talked about how the couple is the hierarchy you know within the family or this and, uhm, can you comment about what happens when that hierarchy disbands and, uhm, you end up with the single parent family and, uhm, you know, the implications of that for the children, not only now, but the implications of that possibly for children who are now adults who had not witnessed really, you know, what maybe a healthy relationship is. 

00:50:05
CLOÉ MADANES Yes. Uhm, I have worked, ah, in the last few years a great deal in divorce prevention, ah, because how you feel more and more, I think it's so important for us to address this issue. Ah, when the divorce is inevitable or when it has already happened, I still work with the couple together to bring together to an understanding that they're always going to be parents together and that they're going to be grandparents together and that they have to be able to get along and have the best possible relationship. One of the issues and when there's a threat of divorce or the divorce has recently happened is that one or more of the children begin to act out in the hope that they will bring the parents back together. And so, let me give you quickly. I have a strategy that I use for that that I've called the human rights and divorce. And, ah, so what I do is that I bring the family together. Whether their parents are divorced or not, I ask everybody to come in with the children. And I, uhm, I say that I want to explain something very important to the children and that is that divorce only exists in democratic, uhm, in, in democratic countries because it is a human right. Just like in, ah, in our culture, we don't have arranged marriage. We don't, don't expect, ah, children to have to obey their parents and marry who their parents say they should marry. So in our culture we have the right to not have to continue to live with somebody when we don't-- we're not happy in that situation. And actually, that this is contemplated in the preamble to our constitution that says that every person has the right to the pursuit of happiness. So this is just an introduction. It doesn't solve anything, but it relates the child to something that they learned in school. So it's something that they can understand. So then I say that, ah, I want each of the parents to take and tell the children that it's their decision to separate and divorce or not and there's nothing that the children can do to change that, it's an adult decision and then list the things that child could do. For example, if you get sick, if you become violent, if you steal, if you break things, if you fail in school, still our decision. We're not going to change it because of you. And so, typically what happens is that one of the parents just cannot say this. So, let's say it's the mother and she will say, "I always love you, Johnny and I always will love you and you're the most important person for me." So then, you will say, "Mrs. so and so, that's very nice but it's not what I asked you to say." And you repeat, "Could you please tell your son that there's nothing he can do to bring you back again?" She tries again and she's can't do it. So then it become so very obvious to everyone in the room that that's the parent that is somehow eliciting the difficult behavior in the child to bring back the other parent into the family. So then I might even act and say to the child, "You know, I admire you for being so concerned about your parents because I've never been so concerned about my parents. I would not fail in school for just for the sake of my mother. I always cared about myself and my friends, what I was going to do with my life. So I really admire you for being so preoccupied with your parents that you're messing up your life for their sake." And that, that really provokes them. So this is, this is the kind of way that you can play with the children and the parents, ah, to get them to collaborate with each other instead of this, ah, the antagonism that typically develops. I don't know if you're going to ask for it. Okay. All right. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN Okay, from, from this microphone. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Okay. So I wanted to ask to Cloé if she can follow up on that, ah, story that she had. I was like very interested and very curious. 

00:54:25
CLOÉ MADANES Ah, okay, so very quickly. One of the strategies, ah, then I use that I come reversing the hierarchy is very useful when have a parent that is very incompetent, ah, for some reasons. So I give you an example of story. This was a father who was a drug addict and he forged prescriptions for painkillers and he had been in jail for this a couple of times and he went back to the painkillers and forging prescriptions. Three teenage children, the mother was so sick of him but she was a very religious person so marriage was out of the question that she was going to stay in the marriage but she have developed a relationship with a priest that it was as if she were married to the priest and the priest was not being help on in the situation. And so the strongest people in the family, I realized, were the teenagers who actually have problems but they didn't notice the problems at the beginning. Uhm, so I decided to do something completely different from the usual thing of putting the parents in, in charge or helping the couple to get together or preventing the addiction. I decided to put the children in charge of their parents' happiness. So I had the therapist say to the children, "You know, your parents have forgotten how to be happy. But you're still young. You can show that, you can teach them. So tell them what could they do to be happy." And at first, the children didn't understand. They didn't know what to say. So I said, "For example, do they go out with friends? Do they go to a movie?" So then the children began to say, "No, they never go out. They don't have friends," and so on. So I-- we organize the children to send the parents out. So one evening a week the parents have to go out and do something and the children would behave like angels until the parents came home. Another day, the children would make dinner for the parents with candlelight then old people's music and so on so their parents could have that quiet dinner and their parents were not allowed to talk about money. Their children would have been sure of it. 

00:56:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Could I, could I have those children, please? I wanna adopt those children. 

00:56:50
CLOÉ MADANES And, ah, weeks and weeks went by like this and the father began to come to decision that a terrible flu and cold and cough and he just sit and have the flu, but it was withdrawal. He had stopped the drugs completely he was going through the withdrawal not even noticing it. And the mother was so moved by the children's loving behavior that she began to be nice to the husband and to practice her Christianity towards, towards her husband not just in relation to the priest and at the, at the end of this, we discovered, ah, that the youngest child was a girl that was, ah, 12 or 13 years old was severely dyslexic. And not knowing this, we had her make notes of what the parents had to do when they went out, what movie they would see, what friends they would go out, with what they would do. And in making these notes, somehow this therapy had an amazing effect because she almost completely recovered from the dyslexia and was able to be in her normal grade with her normal class. So connecting this to the previous question about the single parent, I've used this with single parents and it's so moving. I remember the most moving case probably was a little five-year-old boy with a single mother who was overwhelmed working too much. Ah, she also had teenage children that were giving her trouble, very difficult life. And we ask the little five-year-old, "What could your mother do to be happy?" And he said, "How can she be happy if she never goes out to play? She has to go out to play." 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN So... 

00:58:40
CLOÉ MADANES All right. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN Thank you very much for the richness and it's wealth that you presented.
