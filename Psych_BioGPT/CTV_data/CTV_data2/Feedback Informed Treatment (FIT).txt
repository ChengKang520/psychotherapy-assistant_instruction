Scott Miller Ph.D. Director, International Center for Clinical Excellence 

00:00:25
SCOTT MILLER I'm Scott Miller, the director of the International Center for Clinical Excellence. 

00:00:30
Julie Tilsen Ph.D. Training Coordinator, International Center For Clinical Excellence 

00:00:35
JULIE TILSEN And I'm Julie Tilsen, training coordinator of the International Center for Clinical Excellence. 

00:00:40
What is the origin of Feedback Informed Treatment? 

00:00:45
SCOTT MILLER I, I think what you're going to see in, ah, in both this presentation that Julie and I are doing and in the video vignettes is that, ah, FIT or Feedback Informed Treatment is an evolving perspective about clinical work. Uhm, for me, it really started at the beginning of my career when like most students, I was introduced to specific models of therapy, found one that I wanted to learn more about, uhm, moved specifically to a location to learn about that approach and learned it thoroughly and did it, I think well, at least, ah, with fidelity. Uhm, the problem was that researchers came in about I would say three or four years after we'd started and contacted prior clients, did some research. It turns out that our approach was no more effective than any other treatment approach, which is not bad except that we were claiming that our approach would make you faster, ah, did boost therapy more briefly, to have more single one-off sessions with clients that would be successful. And as a result, I wasn't satisfied with simply doing something that, ah, worked but it didn't, it didn't really tell us why it worked, ah, and it didn't work any better than our existing approaches. Why do what I was doing versus any other, ah, clinicians might do. 

00:02:10
Common Core Factors Factors that all approaches share 

00:02:15
SCOTT MILLER That led a group of colleagues and I to begin exploring what are known as common factors in treatment, if it's not specific approach, then it might be factors that all approaches share that really account for effectiveness. Knowing those, we thought at the time was critical, ah, because that would help us build better treatment approaches. Uhm, and we did that for a number of years. We wrote several books about that. The problem is again, that if all treatment models work because of a group of common core factors then there's really no need to study common core factors. You might as well just pick up a particular model. I've had some experiences with a college professor, Mike Lambert, and a supervisor, Lynn Johnson, and they were talking about measurement, getting feedback from their clients, both in terms of outcome and the connection between a client and a therapist and so, the idea was that perhaps by measuring, ah, we could, uhm, find out whether or not a particular treatment was working. It didn't so much make a difference which one you are using. We began measuring and actually it was quite helpful. 

00:03:15
Talking about Outcomes Relationship with Client improves Outcomes Alliance + Feedback= more successful therapeutic relationship 

00:03:20
SCOTT MILLER We found that talking about the outcomes, the relationship with the client actually improved those outcomes and the relationship had decreased dropout. And we also noticed a side effect, which was that some therapists had uniformly better outcomes than other therapists, which led us to then wonder what is it about these therapists that really makes a difference in them. Uhm, these folks have better alliances. They form better relationships, uhm, and they seek and obtain more feedback on a routine and ongoing basis from their clients. So, feedback informed therapy really is about checking each time you meet your client regardless of the approach that is your preferred approach whether it fits with the person you're working with, and if not that gives you an opportunity critically to, uhm, work with the client, collaborate and develop something that might fit or decide together that this particular style and you as a person might not be a good fit for them and they can be referred on to someone else. 

00:04:20
FIT is NOT a treatment approach universally utilized with any approach 

00:04:20
SCOTT MILLER I, I think what's critical about thinking and feedback informed way, is knowing that this is not a treatment approach. It's not a method for doing therapy. It doesn't tell you how to do the treatment. That's up to you and your client together. It's gonna be based on the qualities of that particular client and the training that that therapist has had, what they, what they know how to do. Uhm, I'm really underscoring that were not saying how you work, or asking the question, "Is your way of working helping this particular person at this time and place?" 

00:05:00
Three steps to becoming FIT-competent 1. Create a "culture of feedback" 2. Integrate alliance and outcome data into clinical care 3. Learn to "fail successfully" 

00:05:10
JULIE TILSEN Well, FIT is, uhm, essentially a systematic way of, uhm, gathering feedback and measuring both the outcome, how things are going, is change happening, as the client defines it and determines it and feedback regarding the alliance. How is this going at this time in this moment with this session, ah, between this client and this therapist? So, with FIT, uhm, as Scott had mentioned earlier, we are not proposing a particular approach or theory or model, ah, to use in your work but what we're saying is, uhm, you need to be monitoring outcome and alliance and that's what FIT is. It's a way to systematize the collection and them monitoring of, uhm, outcome and alliance feedback. 

00:06:00
FIT Monitoring outcome and alliance feedback 

00:06:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. And you know, as I, as I listen to you talk about it there might be some question about why, why outcome? Why alliance? 

00:06:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:06:10
97% of variability in clinicians is in alliance as perceived by client 

00:06:10
SCOTT MILLER So, let's talk about that. Uhm, we know that there is a variation in outcome between clinicians. Uhm, so the question is why are some better at it than others? It turns out that 97% of the variability in outcome between clinicians is an alliance as perceived by the client. Yeah, so, what we need to find out is does the client feel like we have a relationship with them and if not, again this gives us crucial opportunity as you were saying, Julie, to back up, retract, collaborate and see if we can make the relationship actually work. And I think that this fits for a lot of therapist because they see themselves as more eclectic overtime. They know from their experience that no one thing works with everybody they meet. There are a few purists, but not very many, ah, after having been in practice for a while. The second piece about measurement is the outcome. So, why measure outcome and what actually is outcome? 

00:07:05
Functional Outcomes How is clients life, relationships, socially? Improvement in client functioning should appear sooner rather than later 

00:07:05
SCOTT MILLER And in FIT, we're talking about what the research refers to as "functional outcomes." Ah, how's the client's life in general? How's their relationships? How are they doing socially in their work, friends, outside of the home? And the reason measuring outcome is critical is because there is evidence that if a particular relationship between a given provider and a client is going to work, you should start to see improvement in their functioning sooner rather than later. Again, this gives us a critical opportunity as therapists, as helpers to chat with the client if what we do doesn't really lead to changes in their life outside the therapy or consulting room. 

00:07:45
Competence alone doesn't guarantee effectiveness 

00:07:45
JULIE TILSEN I think that one more thing I'd add in terms of why outcome and why measure is something that I really organize around, is this difference between competence and effectiveness and I think traditionally because were trained up in model and often encouraged to pick a model that works for you, uhm, then what we do is we get good at it. We get competent at delivering a certain model. 

00:08:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:08:10
JULIE TILSEN And so, you know, I might be really competent as a narrative therapist, at having conversations I mean, and deconstructing and mapping the landscape of consciousness and action and all these things and I might be super good at that, but that may, you know, just fall dead in the room with someone - 

00:08:30
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:08:30
JULIE TILSEN And be not helpful. 

00:08:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:08:30
JULIE TILSEN And so, to be thinking about being effective from the clients percept-- perspective, what is benefiting them? 

00:08:40
SCOTT MILLER Absolutely. 

00:08:40
JULIE TILSEN Rather than me doing some magical thing, uhm, and getting applause from, uhm, theory geeks or, or technicians. Uhm, that's I think another piece that, uhm, for me, is really helpful to organize around. 

00:08:50
SCOTT MILLER Absolutely. You know, again, and I think what you're saying, ah, I, I, it resonates for me because very early in my career it seemed like, ah, the client's hadn't read the book - 

00:09:05
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:09:05
SCOTT MILLER - about how they were supposed to act. 

00:09:05
JULIE TILSEN They're not making you look good. 

00:09:05
SCOTT MILLER They're not making you look good from visit to visit. Uhm, and, ah, what I did was cling ever tighter to - 

00:09:15
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:09:15
SCOTT MILLER - my rituals, my model, my approach and, ah, if it still didn't work well, then of course, you in a way shifted the burden to the client. 

00:09:20
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:09:20
SCOTT MILLER If it's not the wrong diagnosis and the wrong treatment, it must be the wrong client. 

00:09:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, they're not ready for treatment. 

00:09:25
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:09:30
JULIE TILSEN Or I'm not good at this. 

00:09:30
SCOTT MILLER That's right, which is the other piece. 

00:09:35
The difference between CDOI (Client-Directed, Outcome Informed) and FIT (Feedback Informed Treatment) 

00:09:40
SCOTT MILLER What the difference really calls attention to is that this is an evolving process that we're trying to understand, stretch boundaries and we really never arriving. So, we started with a very specific model of treatment that evolved into the common factors, ah, thinking that evolved into, ah, adding measurement, et cetera and part of the team, ah, believed, ah, at the time we were common factors and working with outcomes, that there was a lot of evidence that said, ah, that the client should be the focus and actually that something we all agreed with. Uhm, but the Client-Directed and Outcome Informed began to take on the qualities of a treatment model, that it was also telling therapists, "here is a way to work." Uhm, you have specific ideas, strategies, as well as techniques that you should use and FIT represents a departure from that. Ah, when, when I have been thinking about it, working with colleagues such as yourself we're attempting to keep this at a metalevel, ah, meaning that we're commenting about how you can evaluate your work, whatever that might be and not tell you how to work with your client. That's something you have to decide locally, between you and this client, their culture, your skills, who they are and not have some disembodied person like me telling you, "here's how you must work." We know that's not true because all of the models that have been developed up to this particular point achieve equal results. What does that mean? That doesn't mean that you can do whatever you want. It means exactly the opposite, you have to find a narrative that fits for your particular client and you. 

00:11:30
JULIE TILSEN I te-- tend to tell folks that the feedback will tell you how to practice. 

00:11:35
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:11:35
JULIE TILSEN So if, if there is, in fact, a wayward telling you how to practice, were telling you to practice with a ritualized, systematic use of feedback and that to use the feedback to inform - 

00:11:45
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:11:45
JULIE TILSEN - what you're gonna select or how you're gonna mix-and-match ways of approaching. 

00:11:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:11:50
Most common challenges and concerns regarding FIT 

00:11:55
SCOTT MILLER As you say that the ritualized piece, Julie, I'm thinking also that another concern that sometimes comes up is about that. 

00:12:00
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:12:00
SCOTT MILLER It's about, wait a second - 

00:12:05
JULIE TILSEN Are you going to get results. 

00:12:05
SCOTT MILLER I'm supposed to use this paper every time - 

00:12:05
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:12:05
SCOTT MILLER And what about the numbers? 

00:12:10
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:12:10
SCOTT MILLER uhm, this also can be, I think, a concern of, of clinicians, as well. Any thoughts about that? 

00:12:15
JULIE TILSEN I honor those concerns - 

00:12:15
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:12:15
JULIE TILSEN And critiques, and I share some. 

00:12:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:12:20
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, and I think that, uhm, for me when we enter into the number land, you know, world of empirical or quantitative, uhm, science, for me, that is one frame. 

00:12:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:12:35
JULIE TILSEN It's a very dominant frame. 

00:12:35
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:12:35
JULIE TILSEN And, ah, but it is a frame and I think of my participation with FIT and using the measures, uhm, as a way to participate in a frame that has a lot of cache- 

00:12:50
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:12:50
JULIE TILSEN - and meaning in our culture and that frankly is the, how, how we move forward- 

00:12:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:12:55
JULIE TILSEN In terms of having a place at the table and if we're going to, uhm, have any freedom to practice. 

00:13:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. Right. 

00:13:05
JULIE TILSEN uhm, there's a way that we, sort of, strategically have to participate in that world. 

00:13:10
SCOTT MILLER Sure. 

00:13:10
JULIE TILSEN And, sort of, the paradox is by participating in that world, subversively my clients and I get to do what we need to do - 

00:13:20
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:13:20
JULIE TILSEN - to be helpful. 

00:13:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And when I, when I listen to you talk about this, I, I, and I hear the key things that, that, ah, I think about with regard to the numbers as well. Number one, uhm, if, if trust me, somebody's counting. Somebody's looking at the numbers. 

00:13:35
JULIE TILSEN That's right. 

00:13:35
SCOTT MILLER So, it's good to speak the language and that's a piece of it. The other piece is giving us, me and the client something to talk around and about other than my internal model or theory. uhm, this is simply a reference point, however. 

00:13:50
JULIE TILSEN That's right. 

00:13:50
SCOTT MILLER I tell clients it's not the truth. I tell therapists it's not the truth. We're not doing assessments. 

00:13:55
JULIE TILSEN That's right. 

00:13:55
SCOTT MILLER We're creating an opportunity to chat with some other reference other than, that words. Uhm, and if you can take that attitude when you approach the scales, ah, I think that they will feel freeing, rather than, uhm, narrowing of the frame that you have with your client. 

00:14:15
What does FIT look like in practice? 

00:14:20
SCOTT MILLER So, what does FIT, Feedback Informed Treatment, ah, look like in practice from day to day? Uhm, and working with colleagues, members of ICCE, ah, we've tried to break this, uhm, continuous process into some discrete pieces. 

00:14:40
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:14:40
1. Creating a "culture of feedback" 

00:14:40
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, uhm, the, the first piece of it that stands out to most people as they watch it being done is what we've called 'creating a culture of feedback,' ah, meaning that it is the practitioner's job to invite the client into giving feedback, to help the client feel like that, ah, their feedback is, will be valued and will be used to guide service and alter service if that, if that's what, ah, the client wants from that particular service. We know again that, ah, therapists vary tremendously in outcome and that most of that is in the alliance, uhm, and that it is variability in the alliance between therapists and their clients that really makes the difference. So, I position the responsibility for creating this culture, initiating this culture on the shoulders of, of the clinician. What can you do? uhm, to begin with, you can work at creating an open atmosphere of communication, ah, letting the client know that, ah, you're really very interested in their feedback, that you work in a slightly different way, that, uhm, if you're going to be helpful that they should feel better sooner rather than later, that that doesn't mean if they do feel better that you're going to end the services. In fact, as long as treatment is working you can meet them as long as you like. The critical twist here, what you referred to, Julie, as turning the system on it's head - 

00:16:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:16:10
SCOTT MILLER - is that what we're going to do if what we do doesn't work. And in that particular instance, we're going to talk, chat, invite others to come in, witness, participate, perhaps consider, ah, referring out. 

00:16:25
JULIE TILSEN One of the things that I make a point of adding about the culture of feedback is, uhm, it's not just when you close the door and you're sitting there with a client - 

00:16:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:16:30
JULIE TILSEN - that needs to go into supervision. 

00:16:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:16:35
JULIE TILSEN The supervisors are working with, uhm, their staff, ah, in that way so that staff feel like they can come in and talk about their struggles and ask questions and have, have a place to do that. 

00:16:45
SCOTT MILLER And this, to me, is related to what you said earlier about competence - 

00:16:50
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:16:50
SCOTT MILLER - versus effectiveness. That competence is not a place where you arrive. 

00:16:55
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:16:55
SCOTT MILLER What you do is continuously push the boundaries of your realm of reliable performance, what you're good at. If you don't discuss where you're not good - 

00:17:00
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:17:00
SCOTT MILLER If you don't get to the edge of what you're proficient at doing, you will never, ever grow. 

00:17:10
Importance of negative feedback rather than confirmatory feedback. 

00:17:15
JULIE TILSEN Okay, one thing that I maybe just want to put a point on when we're talking about the culture of feedback, uhm, is I think people go, okay, yeah. You know, I'll ask my clients how I'm doing and then we're doing well and that's cool. 

00:17:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:17:25
JULIE TILSEN We're really focusing on, uhm, soliciting feedback when we're not doing so well, ah, because that means that's where we have an opportunity to make a choi-- a change. 

00:17:35
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:17:35
JULIE TILSEN And that we need to make a change - 

00:17:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:17:35
JULIE TILSEN - to do something differently. If it's going well - 

00:17:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:17:40
JULIE TILSEN - if the standing alliance is going well and the outcomes are demonstrated and are going well, so again there's also those two working in concert. 

00:17:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:17:45
JULIE TILSEN I think sometimes people think of them separately, uhm, fine, that's good. It's being able to solicit feedback, ah, that, that, you know, I tell people, "You cannot hurt my feeling." 

00:18:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:18:00
JULIE TILSEN I have one left. It's impenetrable. You know, things like this, uhm, that it, it's about soliciting feedback so that we can make adjustments - 

00:18:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:18:10
JULIE TILSEN - in order to do that continual improvement. 

00:18:15
SCOTT MILLER And, uhm, the, the empirical literature supports this. It, it, it indicates, in fact, that these top performing, the clinicians who achieve the best outcomes who are most effective tend to get more negative feedback at the outset of their care. They are like sponges. 

00:18:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:18:30
SCOTT MILLER They simply suck it out of the process. Clients feel willing to tell them. 

00:18:35
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:35
SCOTT MILLER And we're not talking, at least from my experience, huge, big problems. Minor adjustments, ah, the same as what either makes a restaurant experience a good one or a bad one. Too much salt, too little salt, the food a little bit cold - these are things that can be adjusted quickly. 

00:18:50
JULIE TILSEN Very often things that I would, that never would have occurred to me. 

00:18:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:18:50
JULIE TILSEN Very, just seem almost random. 

00:18:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, yeah 

00:18:55
JULIE TILSEN The-- the-- they're very personal things that would be unique to that client or that client's system in the moment- 

00:19:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:19:00
JULIE TILSEN That wouldn't have occurred to me if I wasn't able to have them tell me. 

00:19:05
SCOTT MILLER There have been, and I think that the viewers will see in one of the video vignettes that I do, ah, sometimes when client-, when I've missed the mark. 

00:19:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:19:10
SCOTT MILLER Or when I've conveyed something - 

00:19:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:19:15
SCOTT MILLER - either knowingly or unknowingly - 

00:19:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:19:15
SCOTT MILLER - uhm, that is big. 

00:19:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:19:15
SCOTT MILLER And I'm glad that they say. 

00:19:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:19:20
SCOTT MILLER But my experience is exactly as yours. These are minor things. Didn't like the time, uhm, this chair's uncomfortable, uhm, and you didn't quite get this or - 

00:19:30
JULIE TILSEN Right 

00:19:30
SCOTT MILLER - we didn't talk about what I wanted. 

00:19:30
JULIE TILSEN And so I, I, tell people this is a practice of humility. 

00:19:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:19:35
JULIE TILSEN It's a practice of humility. 

00:19:35
SCOTT MILLER Well, if not then it will certainly make you humble. 

00:19:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:19:40
2. Integrate outcome and alliance feedback into clinical care 

00:19:45
JULIE TILSEN After the culture of feedback, what we talk about is integrating feedback into care. And so, most importantly that means that we're not just giving measures to people and then setting them aside and then doing what we do. It's that we take it seriously. 

00:20:00
Partnering with client to make meaning of their feedback 

00:20:00
JULIE TILSEN We continue to partner with the client around making meaning of what they've said, ah, the outcome rating scale - 

00:20:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah 

00:20:10
JULIE TILSEN - in terms of how things are going and on the session rating scale in terms of how, how they're experiencing the work. So, uhm, we're, we're referring back to that, sometimes very explicitly - 

00:20:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:20:20
JULIE TILSEN - and sometimes, for me, it's sort of in the background and we might have conversation ways of referencing it. Uhm, but it's making sure that it's not just this thing we do that sets, that's set aside, that it's central and integral to what we're doing. 

00:20:35
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:20:35
JULIE TILSEN Ah, so whether it's checking in around, you're saying things are a little better, uhm, can we talk about that and, and, and generate what that means and - 

00:20:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:20:45
JULIE TILSEN - and, and, and talk about that or in the, in the session rating scale, you know, we get some ideas about what they might want to do differently. 

00:20:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:20:55
Must integrate client feedback not a token asking 

00:20:55
JULIE TILSEN You better do those things that they suggested or that you guys came up with as something to try, that it's not a token asking for how this is going and what we're doing, that you're gonna act on it. 

00:21:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:21:05
JULIE TILSEN So, those would be the two very, uhm, explicit things I would say- 

00:21:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:21:10
JULIE TILSEN - in terms of integrating into care and then there's the subtler ways of making sure that, uhm, we're moving, were moving forward as the ORS is indicating and, and, uhm, we're continuing to, uhm, act on and seek and then act on and then act on and seek- 

00:21:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:21:30
JULIE TILSEN Feedback regarding the alliance. 

00:21:30
Session Rating Scale (SRS) and Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) 

00:21:35
SCOTT MILLER The-, there are two ways, two scales that we use. 

00:21:40
Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) Name Age Individually Interpersonally Socially Overall 

00:21:40
SCOTT MILLER Ah, one measures outcome. It's called the ORS or Outcome Rating Scale. Ah, it's given at the beginning of the visit, ah, before you meet, before you start talking. 

00:21:45
Session Rating Scale (SRS V.3.0) Name Age Relationship Goals and Topics Approach or Method Overall ORS Cutoff 

00:21:50
SCOTT MILLER The other is the Session Rating Scale, which is an alliance measure. We give that at the end of the session. Uhm, each of these scales has numbers and cutoffs. What are these cutoffs? Uhm, for example, on the ORS there is a cutoff that separates clients from, ah, clients who are saying things are okay in their lives on average from folks who are saying that things are problematic and they'd like to talk about it. You're gonna see the use of the cutoff in the case with Joanne, uhm, little bit later and how that can be used to foster a discussion, even though this person feels like things in her life are fine, but she's under duress. Somebody else has said, "You must go to therapy," which again is a fairly common occurrence for most practitioners working with folks whose , you know, lives they think are fine, but someone else is concerned. 

00:22:35
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:22:45
3. Learn to "fail successfully" 

00:22:50
SCOTT MILLER Creating a culture of feedback, integrating feedback into clinical care and then, ah, the third part that we talk about is failing successfully. And I think the reason we pull this out of the river of therapeutic process is, ah, because we fail more often than we'd like to admit and therapists are a hopeful group and they're committed to helping people and having a good relationship but something we know from the research literature and most know from their clinical experience is that each individual therapist doesn't help everybody that they see. What are the rates? 

00:23:25
50% of clients you begin with will not have reliable improvement 

00:23:25
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, depending on the study you look at, I'd say that the average is around 50% of people you start with will go on not to have a reliable improvement in their functioning as a result of that work. What happens to these people? A lot of the simply vanish. They go away. They drop out. 

00:23:40
47% drop-out rates on average 

00:23:40
SCOTT MILLER Our dropout rates on average over the last 20 years have been about 47%. So, not only are we not helping folks, but they're often dropping out because we don't know that we're not helping them, or that we're not giving them the kind of help that they wanted. And so, failing successfully means being aware of that, planning, ah, for the, ah, eventuality that we're not going to be successful with everybody and having an extended continuum of care. We have other options that extend beyond our door. 

00:24:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:15
SCOTT MILLER It can include community resources, family, friends and perhaps in the last, ah, piece, other professionals. 

00:24:20
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:25
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, but making sure that there are other avenues for help for clients when we don't help them, and this is discussed from the outset. I don't help everybody. I'm very hopeful that we'll go somewhere but if we don't, you don't have to worry about that. 

00:24:35
JULIE TILSEN I think that the discussing from the outset piece is something that's really important, you know, ah, an old saw-- an old saying we have is discharge starts, ah, at intake. 

00:24:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:24:50
JULIE TILSEN And because lots of times when I talk with people in training about failing successfully they have a lot of anxiety about is this abandonment or giving up on people or predicting hope-- you know, hopelessness or predicting these sorts of things, uhm, and also seeing out, you know, five, six, ten sessions or beyond and then sitting down and having this meeting, sort of like, this dear John or dear Jane letter meeting - 

00:25:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:25:15
JULIE TILSEN That this isn't working and we can't do this anymore. But the point is because we're creating a culture of feedback and we're integrating these things and talking about it, this wouldn't be a surprise. That doesn't mean it may not be difficult or painful or challenging- 

00:25:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. Uh-hmm. 

00:25:30
JULIE TILSEN - or scary for a client or something, but it, it shouldn't be a surprise and they should have been included every step of the way as we're monitoring, uhm, how things are going. That, hah, is this, were-- it's not going so well, things, we're kind of flat lined here but you're not where you want to be. We're trying some new things. These are conversations that we're having along the way because that's part of the culture of feedback and integrating into care - 

00:25:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:25:55
JULIE TILSEN - the, the, the information from the feedback - 

00:26:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:26:00
JULIE TILSEN - and the measures. 

00:26:00
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:26:00
JULIE TILSEN So, it shouldn't be a surprise. It doesn't mean it's not completely difficult. 

00:26:05
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:26:05
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, but I think that people often conceptualize this as a thing that drops out of the blue, that we're, sort of, in charge of- 

00:26:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:26:10
JULIE TILSEN - because some numbers ding or something. 

00:26:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. And in fact, I think that's the key. If you've discussed every single visit the outcomes, if you've, ah, given the ORS, you've plotted the score, you look at how they're progressing over time, uhm, it in fact is as you say, not a surprise to people that they're not going forward. The key to hope and avoiding a feeling of abandonment is working with the client beyond you. Where else can they go? Who else can they see? I think the, the temptation as progress is not forthcoming is for the therapist to assume more and more responsibility and to have less and less dialog with the client. 

00:26:50
JULIE TILSEN Right, right. 

00:26:50
SCOTT MILLER This has to be part of their decision-making process. 

00:26:50
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:26:50
SCOTT MILLER Do we continue or not, as opposed to me making that decision internally because I'm fearful that they may feel abandoned or that they really frankly need help- 

00:27:00
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:27:00
SCOTT MILLER - that I'm just not being successful giving them. 

00:27:10
Continuous Professional Development 

00:27:10
SCOTT MILLER The last piece, and it's probably the newest, ah, for ICCE, ah, and I'm assuming, I know that you do, that, that there will be more things- 

00:27:20
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:27:20
SCOTT MILLER - as time goes on, and we may blow this whole thing up start over again. uhm, but the, the last piece, piece four is, ah, continuous professional development and we hinted at this earlier by saying that, ah, by getting feedback you can essentially see the areas that need improvement. Uhm, now, perhaps I've gone cynical in my, in my, the longer I've been in, in, in, ah, working as a clinician, but I don't think you're going to expand your knowledge base by attending another continuing education event or learning another treatment approach. I think you have to establish a baseline of performance and push the limits. Say, " How can I improve my effectiveness? How can I engage a broader, more diverse clientele in a more effective way?" And the data will give you a heads-up. At that point, you can seek out options and possibilities, supervision, consultation coaching from somebody who has an expertise in a particular area, joining a community of expertise, uhm, the International Center for Clinical Excellence is one of those choices, ah, where you can rub shoulders with people who are doing exactly what you're doing and that is trying to push the realm of reliable performance. 

00:28:35
JULIE TILSEN So, I think to be clear about what I, what you're talking about is the thing we can get better at is how we solicit feedback - 

00:28:45
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:28:45
JULIE TILSEN Creating a culture of change so that people can really let us have it- 

00:28:50
SCOTT MILLER Yes, that's right. 

00:28:50
JULIE TILSEN - about when it's not going well and what we can get good at is having those responsive conversations with people. 

00:28:55
SCOTT MILLER When I'm out in training sometimes about this continuous professional development, I ask therapists, "When was the last time you were affected by one of your clients?" Now, I don't mean going home and worrying about them. 

00:29:05
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:29:05
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, I mean that your experience with a client actually changes how you live your life - 

00:29:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:29:10
SCOTT MILLER - how you think about your life. If that hasn't happened recently- 

00:29:15
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:29:15
SCOTT MILLER - growth really isn't happening. 

00:29:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:29:20
SCOTT MILLER And that's where, I think, the feedback can really make a big difference. 

00:29:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, you're, you're as open to being touched as- 

00:29:30
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:29:30
JULIE TILSEN As you expect them to be. 

00:29:30
SCOTT MILLER Yup. 

00:29:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:29:35
For More information on FIT and the International Center for Clinical Excellencce (ICCE) visit www.centerforclinicalexcellence.com Working with Calvin 

00:29:55
SCOTT MILLER In this first vignette, you're going to see me working with a gentleman named Calvin. Calvin is a kind of client that some might call 'SPMI' or severely and persistently mentally ill. Let me just say that the measures, the ORS and the SRS are being used with virtually all kinds of clients that all ranges of diagnoses in all kinds of settings, residential, outpatient, intensive outpatient, ah, and in case management. And this particular gentleman could be seen in any of those formats, really. And what happens here in this first segment is I introduce and work with Calvin to create a culture of feedback, uhm, and as the conversation unfolds, ah, some challenges o-- occur in the conversation. Ah, one of them is that Calvin is reticent about touching the paper, and you're going to see, hopefully, my effort at flexibly accommodating that during the conversation with him. As you watch, ah, I also think you'll see that I try very hard to listen to what Calvin says. Really, what I'm doing is desperately trying to understand him, who he is, what's important to him, what his preferences are. In other words, I'm trying to establish a working alliance. 

00:31:30
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, uhm, I'm, uhm, I'm Scott. 

00:31:35
CALVIN I'm Calvin. 

00:31:40
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, welcome. Welcome, Calvin. Uhm, is it okay if I call you by your first name, Calvin? 

00:31:45
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:31:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay, great. Please call me Scott. 

00:31:45
CALVIN Okay. 

00:31:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, I prefer that rather than Dr. Miller or some of the other things I get called sometimes. You, you found us okay? 

00:32:00
CALVIN Yeah, yeah. I knew a friend who's come here. They said you guys were over here and so it was okay just to come over. 

00:32:10
SCOTT MILLER Absolutely, that's-- we've been here about, oh, I don't know, almost, uhm, 17 years now, a little clinic in the neighborhood and, uhm, we usually work with people who live right in the area, uhm, and uhm, uhm, we've run it as a free clinic for all that time. So, I'm very glad you came in. 

00:32:35
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:32:35
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, and, uhm, do you know much about us other than where we were? 

00:32:40
CALVIN Just that you help people. 

00:32:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:32:45
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:32:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. We do our best. 

00:32:45
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:32:45
Creating a culture of feedback "we work differently here" 

00:32:45
SCOTT MILLER And, uhm, we work somewhat differently than other places do. 

00:32:50
You get what YOU want 

00:32:55
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, yeah, uhm, if you've had any experience with therapists and professional mental health people, ah, before, uhm, we're really wanting to make sure that, uhm, you get what you want by coming here. And, uhm, part of our way of working is that we, we, uhm, ask people to help us know if we're on track and we usually do that every time we meet. And here's our, here's our idea. 

00:33:30
Culture of Feedback" signs of improvement sooner than later 

00:33:30
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, if what I know is gonna be of help to you, then you should see some signs of improvement sooner rather than later. 

00:33:40
CALVIN Okay. 

00:33:40
Introducing idea of "colleagues helping out" in very first session 

00:33:45
SCOTT MILLER It doesn't have to take years, even months. Uhm, I don't know everything. Uhm, I have a group of colleagues here that, ah, can help out if I happen to not know the best way, but it all depends on, uhm, uhm, us, kind of, talking and tracking to make sure that you feel like this is the right fit for you. Does that, does that make sense, Calvin? 

00:34:15
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:34:15
Introducing the measures 

00:34:15
SCOTT MILLER And the way we like to track is to, uhm, use a brief form, kind of a measure, uhm, where it's purpose is to help you help me stay on track. Uhm, am I making sense? 

00:34:35
CALVIN Yeah. You gotta fill something out. 

00:34:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, yeah. Let me, let me show you. It's, uhm, it's a short scale, actually where we ask people if, how they're doing in four different areas of their life. 

00:34:55
CALVIN And my name goes on that at the top? 

00:35:00
SCOTT MILLER It doesn't have to, but it can. Would you prefer it to be on there or not? 

00:35:05
CALVIN Not on there. I mean, where does this go in, once we're finished with it? 

00:35:10
SCOTT MILLER You know, I didn't explain that very well. 

00:35:10
CALVIN Right. 

00:35:10
Accepting responsibility for not being clear 

00:35:15
SCOTT MILLER This is just for me and you, because as I said, the whole purpose of all this is to make sure I'm giving you what you want. 

00:35:20
CALVIN There a lot of people around here. Do they see it? 

00:35:30
SCOTT MILLER Only if you say they should. Otherwise, it's me and you. 

00:35:35
CALVIN I don't really want anyone else to see it. 

00:35:35
SCOTT MILLER That's perfect. That's fine. That's absolutely fine because that's the most important thing- 

00:35:40
CALVIN Okay. 

00:35:40
SCOTT MILLER - that you and I figure out am I doing things, what we're talking about, is it helping you in your individual life, in your relationships, socially, uhm, with friends or work and such and then kind of a overall general category and what I ask folks to do if they can or are willing is to mark on each of these four lines and low scores are here, high scores here and you kind of mark along this line low to high, ah, for each of these areas, uhm, kind of based on how you feel over the last week. Does that make sense to you? 

00:36:35
CALVIN Uh-huh. 

00:36:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Would you, would you be willing to fill it out for me? 

00:36:40
CALVIN Uhm, I don't think so. 

00:36:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Some concerns about filling it out, more than just who sees it. 

00:36:55
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:36:55
SCOTT MILLER Well, would you feel comfortable sharing what that concern might be, or should we just kind of set it aside for now? What do you think? 

00:37:00
Therapist makes no assumptions, works to clarify client's concerns 

00:37:05
CALVIN I don't know where it came from. 

00:37:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:37:10
CALVIN I don't know where it's been. 

00:37:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:37:15
CALVIN You told me where it would go. 

00:37:20
SCOTT MILLER Right, right. 

00:37:20
CALVIN But, ah, I don't know who had it before. 

00:37:25
SCOTT MILLER Right, right. Well, let me just tell you. I printed this form in my office on the computer today. 

00:37:35
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:37:35
SCOTT MILLER But it also sounds to me like you have some concerns about where this paper might have been - 

00:37:40
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:37:40
SCOTT MILLER - who's touched it. 

00:37:45
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:37:45
SCOTT MILLER Am I right about that? 

00:37:45
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:37:45
The ORS is available in over 20 languages including sign language and an oral version 

00:37:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. How about this, then? Instead of doing the paper, would it be okay if I just ask you these questions and mark it for you? Would that be alright? 

00:37:55
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:37:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Kind of a relief there, eh? 

00:38:00
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:38:00
SCOTT MILLER Well, that's the whole idea, right? We do things so that they fit for you. 

00:38:05
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:38:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So, if it's okay then, let me just ask you, uhm, on a, like, a number scale from zero to ten where ten is the best things of ever been and zero is the worst, does this make sense? 

00:38:30
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:38:30
SCOTT MILLER How are things for you individually, for you as a person right now, zero on the bottom side, ten or anywhere in between? 

00:38:40
CALVIN Maybe a three. 

00:38:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay, perfect. Is that number just kind of, sort of, came quickly to you. 

00:38:45
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:38:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right, perfect. In your relationships, the same thing your, like, family or close relationships, more like loved ones, zero to ten? Ten is the best. 

00:39:05
CALVIN Ah, one. 

00:39:10
SCOTT MILLER One. So, in that area things are not going quite as well as they are individually. 

00:39:20
Important information emerges that will be helpful in forming an alliance 

00:39:20
CALVIN Ah, ah, I do my own research. I have to work alone on it, so, I don't really work around a lot of people. 

00:39:30
goals (research) references (spending time alone) 

00:39:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Okay. I'm taking some notes here, by the way. That's because I have a poor memory. 

00:39:35
CALVIN Okay. 

00:39:40
SCOTT MILLER And, ah, but you're welcome to take these notes if you want. 

00:39:40
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:40
SCOTT MILLER Or I can keep them in the special place for you. 

00:39:45
CALVIN In the special place. 

00:39:45
SCOTT MILLER If ever you wanted them, you could have them. 

00:39:45
CALVIN Okay. 

00:39:50
SCOTT MILLER It's a deal? 

00:39:50
CALVIN It's a deal. 

00:39:50
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. So, you work, uhm, alone, do some research on your own. 

00:39:55
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:55
SCOTT MILLER And because of that you're not interacting. You're not out with people as, as often? 

00:40:00
CALVIN Right. 

00:40:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. Somehow, I feel a kinship with you. I, when I'm not talking to people, uhm, I spend a lot of time in my office doing research and writing. 

00:40:15
CALVIN Uh-hmm. Yeah. 

00:40:20
SCOTT MILLER And you do the same. 

00:40:20
CALVIN It's important, yeah. 

00:40:20
SCOTT MILLER It is important. I'm sort of a-- my own interest here, is there a particular topic that you're interested in? 

00:40:30
CALVIN No, I just go to the library and - 

00:40:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:40:30
Calvin reveals more about his goals and preferences 

00:40:30
CALVIN - use books or the computer to do research. 

00:40:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yeah, it is. 

00:40:35
CALVIN Yes, it's important. 

00:40:35
SCOTT MILLER Absolutely important. And, uhm, library, incredible resource. 

00:40:40
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:40:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, uhm, next question, socially that would be like work or school, maybe your research, friends, zero on the low side ten on the high side. 

00:40:55
CALVIN Oh, I, I go to work. Maybe a three. 

00:41:05
SCOTT MILLER Maybe a three. Okay. A three. And then, kind of a overall catch all category, anything that the three prior questions didn't ask about, uhm, or kind of an average of all of them. 

00:41:30
SCOTT MILLER Maybe a three. 

00:41:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Okay. And then I'll show you, if it's okay, what I do here is I add up these numbers, this is the hard part for me, uhm, three, three, three, uhm, nine plus one and the total is 10. And then what I do is I have a, graphs here and every week you come in, we are here at our first time right here. 

00:42:00
CALVIN Right. 

00:42:05
SCOTT MILLER Making sense? 

00:42:05
CALVIN Uh-huh. 

00:42:05
SCOTT MILLER And you were right at a 10 here. 

00:42:10
CALVIN Uh-huh. 

00:42:10
Score and plot at each visit to track progress 

00:42:10
SCOTT MILLER Right there. And, uhm, what we would do each time we meet is tracked and hopefully, our work together, the scores would go up over time. 

00:42:20
Continuing to work on creating a "culture of feedback" 

00:42:25
SCOTT MILLER If it doesn't go up, then you and I will chat and figure out what else do I need to do, what other ideas do I have - 

00:42:30
CALVIN Uh-huh. 

00:42:30
SCOTT MILLER - to be of help to you. Sometimes, if you're interested I can even invite colleagues. 

00:42:40
Preparing to "fail successfully 

00:42:40
SCOTT MILLER But only if you're interested, to come in and consult with us, give some suggestions. The important part about this is it puts you in the driver's seat. You, kind of, say push on the gas or slow down, turn right or turn left, Scott, so that we get it just right for you. Does that make some sense? 

00:43:05
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:43:05
SCOTT MILLER And so if it goes up, I will meet you as long as you like. 

00:43:10
Outcome drives process. If it's helping, we can continue to meet 

00:43:10
SCOTT MILLER We can meet forever, if that would help, if it's helping. If it's not helping, I'll change. 

00:43:15
CALVIN Wha-- what are the, the lines? 

00:43:20
SCOTT MILLER That's great. I love that. 

00:43:20
Calvin shows interest. Engagement is the best predictor of outcome 

00:43:20
SCOTT MILLER These lines right here, this one is a big, thick dashed line. 

00:43:25
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:43:25
SCOTT MILLER That's called the cut off and what that means is that when scores are below this, which you can see your score is, that means that the person is saying, " I'd like to talk to somebody. There are some parts of my life I'd like to change, something I'd like different for me." Is that, did it catch it? 

00:43:50
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:43:50
SCOTT MILLER It did? 

00:43:50
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:43:50
SCOTT MILLER And, uhm, if it's above the line then people are saying, "I'm pretty good. I'm doing well." And so our, my hope for us would be that as we work together the scores will go up, potentially right across that line over time. 

00:44:05
CALVIN Good. 

00:44:10
SCOTT MILLER Does it make sense? 

00:44:10
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:44:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And so, I guess what it says here is you're in the right place. Does it feel that way so far? 

00:44:20
CALVIN Yeah, it feels good. 

00:44:20
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. And so, uhm, would it be okay then if we, kind of, talked about what, what made you decide to come in today and - 

00:44:30
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:44:30
Client beings to talk about reasons for seeking services 

00:44:30
SCOTT MILLER - what you were hoping for, what's been going on? 

00:44:35
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:44:35
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. Perfect. Well, Calvin, how about that then? 

00:44:40
CALVIN Yeah, okay. 

00:44:45
SCOTT MILLER Ah, what's been going on of late that made you think, "Now's the time to talk to those guys down the street"? 

00:44:50
CALVIN Well, I've been doing my research - 

00:44:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah? 

00:44:55
CALVIN - every day. 

00:44:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:44:55
Scott listens, trying to understand the Alliance (goals, means, client preferences) 

00:44:55
CALVIN I may miss a day. I sometimes have to work and can't get to the library before closes. 

00:45:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:05
CALVIN But last week I didn't go at all. 

00:45:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:45:10
CALVIN And I didn't work every day so there were days I could've go but I didn't go. 

00:45:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:15
CALVIN And I'm getting behind on my research. 

00:45:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:20
CALVIN And I can't get caught up now because I missed four days last week. 

00:45:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:45:30
CALVIN And so this week I've missed two days already and I'm even further behind and I don't know why. I know I need to. I know it's important. 

00:45:40
Important information for building alliance Client: "research is important" 

00:45:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:45
CALVIN So, I talked to my friend Jacob, who's been here before. 

00:45:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:45:50
CALVIN And he said you were able to help him go back and do what he was doing- 

00:45:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:55
CALVIN - when he couldn't do it anymore. 

00:46:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:46:00
CALVIN And he said that it didn't cost anything and that you were, you know would help me with that. 

00:46:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:46:10
Client goal: getting back to research 

00:46:10
CALVIN But I need to get back to my research- 

00:46:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:46:10
CALVIN - because it's important. 

00:46:10
SCOTT MILLER Alright. 

00:46:10
CALVIN But I'm six days behind now. 

00:46:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:46:15
CALVIN and I don't know how to get back to where I was on my research. 

00:46:20
SCOTT MILLER You sound like you keep very careful track of the days you spend on the researching you're doing. 

00:46:25
CALVIN Uh-hmm. It's important. 

00:46:25
SCOTT MILLER And so, now that that's not happening, this is quite unusual for you. 

00:46:30
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:46:30
Scott reflects his understanding of what is important to Calvin (goals, preferences) 

00:46:30
SCOTT MILLER Because usually you're very planned, I could say methodical about getting to the library, making sure you get the books out - 

00:46:40
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:46:45
SCOTT MILLER - checking on the computer there. 

00:46:45
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:46:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. And now, six days behind, four days last week. 

00:46:50
CALVIN Two days this week. 

00:46:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So, six total and two days this which is quite unusual. 

00:47:00
SCOTT MILLER In the next segment that you're going to see, I'm still working with Calvin and trying to understand what kind of relationship we are going to have. The research literature is very clear about what constitutes a good working alliance with clients. Number one, mutually and collaboratively determine goals, meaning or purpose. We have to agree what are we about. Uhm, secondly, agreement on the means or methods that are going to be used to achieve those goals. Third, the client has to experience me and the interaction as warm, empathic and genuine, what, ah, has long been called the Rogerian core conditions and all of this is held together, ah, the glue is that there's an accommodation of the clients' preferences, uhm, how they want to be viewed by me and how they want the two of us to interact and make meaning together. And so that's the central focus of this next segment. 

00:48:00
SCOTT MILLER Calvin, I'm, I'm intrigued, uhm, because you said two or three weeks ago, things were going differently. 

00:48:10
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:10
SCOTT MILLER And something about it helps when you have work. 

00:48:20
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:48:20
Exploring means he has used in the past to achieve his goals 

00:48:20
SCOTT MILLER If i-- if it's a regular work day or if you have regular work every so often - 

00:48:25
CALVIN If I, yeah. 

00:48:25
SCOTT MILLER - then you're less likely to end up sleeping in. 

00:48:30
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:48:30
SCOTT MILLER And things getting behind. 

00:48:30
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:48:35
SCOTT MILLER What, what kind of work are you talking about? 

00:48:35
CALVIN I, I go to Home Depot - 

00:48:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:48:40
CALVIN - and wait, cause they hire people to work every day, so I get down there early - 

00:48:45
SCOTT MILLER Really? 

00:48:45
CALVIN - like six o'clock. 

00:48:45
SCOTT MILLER Hire them to do? 

00:48:45
CALVIN Whatever. 

00:48:50
SCOTT MILLER You're kind of a jack-of-all-trades. 

00:48:50
CALVIN Yeah, loading drywall, ah - 

00:48:55
SCOTT MILLER Really? 

00:48:55
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:48:55
SCOTT MILLER How'd you learn about this? 

00:48:55
CALVIN I just, ah, ah, my friend Jacob does it, too. We go down there every morning. 

00:49:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:49:05
CALVIN Some mornings there are guys coming in and they're, they're picking up supplies - 

00:49:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:49:05
CALVIN - and they just need extra hands, so they hire you for the day. 

00:49:10
SCOTT MILLER Alright. 

00:49:10
CALVIN If they don't hire me, then I still have to go work and I go to the library. 

00:49:15
SCOTT MILLER Oh, I see. I see. 

00:49:15
CALVIN And, uhm, so, some days, some weeks I work every day. 

00:49:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:49:20
CALVIN But I work every day. 

00:49:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:49:25
CALVIN Cause if I don't there, I go and work at the library. 

00:49:25
SCOTT MILLER Exactly. And Jacob usually comes over to your house, or you to Jacob's house? 

00:49:30
CALVIN Jacob has a car. 

00:49:30
SCOTT MILLER He does. 

00:49:30
CALVIN So, he takes me to Home Depot. 

00:49:35
SCOTT MILLER Alright. 

00:49:35
CALVIN If he gets hired and I don't, I can get to the library by the bus and the train. 

00:49:40
SCOTT MILLER All right. 

00:49:40
CALVIN I, if neither one of us get on, he drops me by the library. 

00:49:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay, and then he does what he does. 

00:49:45
CALVIN He do-- I, I don't know what Jacob does dur-- for his work every day. 

00:49:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Alright. And has Jacob still been coming around? 

00:49:55
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:49:55
SCOTT MILLER He does. But the work hasn't been as consistent or... 

00:49:55
CALVIN Well, I just haven't been getting up in time. 

00:50:00
SCOTT MILLER I see. Okay. 

00:50:00
CALVIN I been staying in and missing, he won't wait very long. 

00:50:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay, all right. And that started happening two or three weeks ago? 

00:50:10
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:50:15
SCOTT MILLER And before that you were getting up. 

00:50:15
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:50:15
SCOTT MILLER Is that right? 

00:50:15
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:50:15
SCOTT MILLER What's different, then? 

00:50:15
Further explore successful means previously used to meet goals 

00:50:20
CALVIN Well, it's just, it's just that the research isn't really creating anything. 

00:50:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:50:30
CALVIN I just spend a lot of time floating around and I wanted to, to create something. 

00:50:35
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:50:35
CALVIN I wanted to, to make something. I wanted it to come together and I've been working on it a long time. 

00:50:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:50:45
CALVIN I-- it should make something. 

00:50:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. It should end up somewhere. 

00:50:50
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:50:50
SCOTT MILLER It should create something. 

00:50:50
Client goal: to make something meaningful 

00:50:55
CALVIN And I wanted two weeks ago, I went in with this idea that I had a lot of stuff written down, cause I write stuff down. 

00:51:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:51:05
CALVIN And I thought I, I think I see a, a pattern. 

00:51:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:51:05
CALVIN I think I see where it's going to come together. 

00:51:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:51:10
CALVIN And that was going to be the day it was going to happen, and I worked all day and, and, and I even stayed over on the computer longer and I stayed in the library till they made the announcement you had to take your stuff and check out cause I wanted it to be- 

00:51:25
SCOTT MILLER It was almost there. 

00:51:25
CALVIN It's there and then I had to leave and the next day I couldn't get back to where I'd been and... 

00:51:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:51:35
CALVIN I couldn't see the pattern anymore and, so, I just went home that day. I thought maybe if I take a day and the next day the pattern wasn't there and the next day, but I, I just know that was the day, if I'd had just 30 more minutes- 

00:51:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:51:45
CALVIN - I would have had, I could have, it could have come together. 

00:51:50
SCOTT MILLER It kind of evaporated? 

00:51:55
CALVIN I can't get it back. 

00:51:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:51:55
CALVIN And, so, I, I stay at home waiting to see the pattern again and - 

00:52:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:52:00
CALVIN But when I do see the pattern, it's going to be too many hours to make up - 

00:52:05
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:52:10
CALVIN - on, on the work and it's important. 

00:52:10
Identify client's goal: meaningful research 

00:52:10
SCOTT MILLER You're, you're looking for that pattern because if it's there, it really helps focus you? 

00:52:15
CALVIN It was there. 

00:52:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:52:20
CALVIN I had it. 

00:52:20
SCOTT MILLER If the pattern started to come into focus again- 

00:52:20
CALVIN Uh-huh. 

00:52:20
SCOTT MILLER You would be out of bed, rushing to that library to make sure your standing in line. 

00:52:25
CALVIN It's important. 

00:52:25
SCOTT MILLER That's exactly right. 

00:52:30
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:52:30
SCOTT MILLER Sometimes when I'm writing, I'll spend days on a paragraph and I feel such despair - 

00:52:35
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:52:35
SCOTT MILLER - I'm never, It just won't come together. 

00:52:40
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:52:45
Assessing the Alliance with the SRS 

00:52:50
SCOTT MILLER In FIT, the session ends with the administration of the SRS, or Session Rating Scale. This is the final opportunity, the last chance for you and the client to make sure that your working alliance is going well or determine if there's some feedback from the client that can help you establish a better fit and better relationship. 

00:53:10
Introducing the Session Rating Scale (SRS) creating a culture of feedback 

00:53:10
SCOTT MILLER So, in this particular section, I introduce the SRS and I try to create a culture of feedback so that, ah, Calvin will feel very comfortable letting me know if there are things that could be changed about the interaction and interestingly enough, Calvin says there's something that could be different. Importantly, the fact that he tells me this is a sign that we're engaged, because most people, if, ah, they have thoughts but they're not engaged, they simply disappear. They, they decide not to say, that it's not worth it. They figure out that you're not going to listen to it anyway. So, here I'm trying to take seriously what he says and see how we can change what we do together so that the next visit will be, uhm, better from his point of view. 

00:54:05
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, Calvin, we're, uhm, we're nearing the end of our time this time. I, I've, uhm, I, I feel like you've, ah, painted a really clear picture of, ah, how things are for you and where you'd like to go, bringing this pattern into more focus so that you can get back to your work and research and, uhm, I, I have to say that, uhm, in fact, the hair's kind of standing up, I'm anticipating, uhm, some research that, that, ah, that is, is important. I know it, yeah. And so, uhm, as I said at the beginning we generally like to end these conversations by asking people for some feedback about the meeting, about the time. And I have a, uhm, I have another, uhm, set of very short and brief questions about how things have gone and, uhm, I'll just keep them here on my lap, if that's okay. 

00:55:20
CALVIN Okay. 

00:55:20
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, um... 

00:55:20
CALVIN And you - 

00:55:20
SCOTT MILLER And I... 

00:55:25
CALVIN - you see these and no one else? 

00:55:25
SCOTT MILLER Absolutely. I should have said that. Again, I'm the person who sees it and you and I are the ones who will talk about it and that's it. Unless and until, ah, you say otherwise. 

00:55:40
CALVIN Okay. 

00:55:40
The SRS assesses the components of the alliance: goals, means, relationship 

00:55:40
SCOTT MILLER Alright. uhm, and really this is about how things were here, uhm, uhm, in different areas, our relationship, whether you felt heard and understood and respected about the goals and topics. Did, did we really talk about what you want, uhm, about this approach. Does it feel like it's a fit? Is it coming together? 

00:56:05
Setting the stage for negative feedback 

00:56:05
SCOTT MILLER And then, overall did it feel complete? Were there some things missing? And I have to tell you that, I'm not interested in perfect scores. uhm, you don't have to worry about hurting my feelings because, as I hope I made clear at the beginning, it's really about me figuring out how to be of help to you, fine-tuning, sort of like your research. I have to work very hard at making sure that it's just right. 

00:56:40
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

00:56:40
SCOTT MILLER So that we accomplish what we're here to accomplish. Does that make sense? 

00:56:45
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:56:45
SCOTT MILLER So, the first one is about relationship, and the one side says, I did not feel heard, understood and respected.' The other side, I left feeling, feeling heard, understood and respected. And it goes again from zero to 10? 

00:57:05
[sil.] 

00:57:10
CALVIN Maybe five. 

00:57:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So, that would be right in the center. Good. 'We did not work on or talk about what I wanted to work on and talk about.' 'We worked on and talked about what I wanted to talk about.' Again, a zero to a 10? 

00:57:25
CALVIN A ten. 

00:57:25
SCOTT MILLER A ten? 

00:57:30
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:57:30
SCOTT MILLER So, we, we, kind of, really fit there. 

00:57:35
CALVIN My research is important. 

00:57:35
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. The approach we used, the appro-- the therapist's approach is not a good fit for me. The therapist's approach is a good fit for me. Zero to ten? 

00:57:45
CALVIN A five. 

00:57:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. This is a five. And then, There was something missing in the session today. Overall, today's session was right for me. Zero to ten? 

00:58:10
CALVIN Seven. 

00:58:10
SCOTT MILLER Seven. I love how careful you are. You give things lots of thought. What we do, again, is we add these up, five, ten, fifteen, twenty and twenty-seven, right? 

00:58:25
Scott scores the SRS... 

00:58:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Let me just write that down, twenty-seven. No name up here, uhm, and you remember that graph? 

00:58:35
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:58:35
SCOTT MILLER Well, we also can mark here's your score on the ORS and a what was that? Twenty-seven? 

00:58:45
CALVIN Twenty-seven. 

00:58:45
SCOTT MILLER Twenty-seven, right. Twenty-seven would be about right here on the SRS. 

00:58:50
CALVIN Is it above the line? 

00:58:55
SCOTT MILLER It's above this line for the ORS but it's a little bit below the line for the SRS. 

00:59:00
...and compares it to a cut-off of 36 

00:59:00
SCOTT MILLER The SRS has - 

00:59:00
CALVIN Yeah. 

00:59:00
SCOTT MILLER - one of those lines, as well. 

00:59:00
CALVIN So, we have to go above that line? 

00:59:05
SCOTT MILLER We have to figure out what I need to do to make sure that you feel like this is right for you. So, actually you can give us a few hints, uhm, what did I do with it here? There it is. 

00:59:20
Scott uses the specific scores to elicit feedback 

00:59:20
SCOTT MILLER It seems like the ar-- areas where I can really use some help from you on is the approach or the method, number one. Anything that could have happened here today to make sure you feel like, 'Ah, this is even a better approach for me'? Anything that didn't happen, anything that you can put your finger on? 

00:59:40
CALVIN There were a lot of questions but I, you didn't tell me how to get back to my research. 

00:59:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:59:50
Client gives very specific negative feedback 

00:59:55
CALVIN And I thought when I talked to Jacob that it, it would be like a, there would be something I could do to get back. 

01:00:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay, so some more direction about how to do that. 

01:00:05
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:00:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. That would help you? 

01:00:10
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:00:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Perfect. And the second thing, ah, let me just ask, just my thought, if you felt like there were more directions in our work together, would that have you feeling more like I'd heard and understood what you were here for? 

01:00:25
CALVIN Yeah, a little bit. 

01:00:30
SCOTT MILLER A little bit? 

01:00:30
CALVIN Ah, yeah, I just don't have a lot of friends and people, so I, I don't feel good talking to new people right away. 

01:00:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:00:45
CALVIN It would help but I, I still need to feel better - 

01:00:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:00:50
CALVIN - with you. 

01:00:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:00:55
CALVIN When, when that happens that will be higher. 

01:01:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:01:00
CALVIN It's just I don't know you. 

01:01:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. Is there anything I can do to add any more sense of comfort in coming here? 

01:01:10
CALVIN No, I, I feel comfortable - 

01:01:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:01:10
CALVIN - with you. I just need to know you. 

01:01:15
SCOTT MILLER More time? 

01:01:15
CALVIN More time. 

01:01:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. I like that. It's good to be, uhm, cautious - 

01:01:20
CALVIN Right. 

01:01:25
SCOTT MILLER - and to take time to get to know people. 

01:01:25
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:01:25
SCOTT MILLER First impressions aren't always right. 

01:01:30
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

01:01:30
SCOTT MILLER I want you to know, though, that anytime you have any feedback, I'm very willing to hear it and I'll make some adjustments. 

01:01:40
CALVIN Okay. 

01:01:40
SCOTT MILLER And one key thing I feel like I need to give more thought to is how to give you more direction about how to get back to your research. 

01:01:50
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:01:50
Scott responds to Calvin's feedback by giving a specific suggestion 

01:01:50
SCOTT MILLER And so, I have one small idea. It's not well-formed, but I am willing to share it with you if it would be of interest. 

01:02:00
Client responds positively 

01:02:05
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:02:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. I was interested that two or three weeks ago you had this focus. You felt like you saw the pattern. Sometimes when we chase things, they remain out of grasp. And so, we work harder and it kind of doesn't come into being. It just eludes us. Am I making sense? 

01:02:30
CALVIN Yeah, yeah. 

01:02:35
SCOTT MILLER And our drive and our passion make us sit and try even harder. We only end up frustrated. My one brief suggestion is to just notice, maybe spending a little time in the mornings right when you wake up, just noticing, letting your mind go, float, noticing any sort of clarity about that pattern. Is there a time when you feel like the pattern is more clear, any moment at all? Just notice it. Don't chase it, just notice it. 

01:03:10
CALVIN Okay. 

01:03:10
SCOTT MILLER And see if that happens at all. When we, until we meet next time. 

01:03:15
CALVIN Okay. 

01:03:15
SCOTT MILLER It could come at any moment. It could come while you're eating dinner and suddenly some new idea comes, ahh. It may actually be a different pattern than you were looking for in the beginning - 

01:03:25
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:03:25
SCOTT MILLER - but a pattern nonetheless. Does this make sense to you? 

01:03:30
CALVIN Yeah, yeah. 

01:03:30
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. When do you think about meeting again? 

01:03:40
SCOTT MILLER The next section features Calvin at his second visit, and it begins like all sessions with FIT, with the ORS, the Outcome Rating Scale, how have things been since the last visit. That's a critical component to actually making sure as you, ah, meet the client and introduce the scale again for the second time that you work purposefully to create that culture of feedback, letting them know that we're not interested so much in what they feel right this second, but how things have been over the prior week's experience. And, as I think you'll see, there have been some changes. We manage the scale. There's been an interesting change in Calvin's willingness to, ah, fill out the form and then we plot that on a graph and we discuss what's happened in between visits. 

01:04:30
SCOTT MILLER Welcome back. 

01:04:30
CALVIN Thank you. 

01:04:35
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, uhm, you remember from last time that, uhm, uhm, each time we meet, I ask, ah, some questions about how things have been. 

01:04:45
Begins session by reinforcing "culture of feedback" 

01:04:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, so that we can figure out, uhm, is this helping? 

01:04:55
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

01:04:55
SCOTT MILLER And last time you, uhm, I reviewed the paperwork and last time you gave me some really important feedback. I really appreciated it. And so, I'd like to start, if it's okay, with, ah, with the same questions again and, uhm, you remember that the, the first one is about how things are for you in your life, no name here. I printed this off today on my computer and I'm the person who's carried it here to the office. Uhm, uhm, would it be okay if we start with this? 

01:05:35
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

01:05:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Uhm, uhm, there are the four questions. How are you doing? Uhm, how are things in your relationships? Uhm, socially? Uhm, uhm, and overall? Uhm, and, ah, uhm, uhm, I, I can read these to you again, Uhm, and m-- mark the numbers here for you. Uhm, uhm, uhm, if you, if you'd like. 

01:06:20
CALVIN I, I, I could write 'em down, too. 

01:06:25
SCOTT MILLER You could? 

01:06:25
CALVIN Yeah, I mean it's my paper. 

01:06:30
SCOTT MILLER It is. And, uhm, so you, would you like to fill it out and, ah, yourself then? 

01:06:40
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:06:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:06:40
CALVIN My paper. 

01:06:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay, because it's perfectly okay with me if we, if I read them to you but I, you know, it would be cool to see how it works for you, uhm, with the, with the paper. Is that alright? 

01:07:00
CALVIN Yes. 

01:07:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:07:00
CALVIN Yeah. My paper. 

01:07:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And here's the pen, and you mark, uhm, low scores to the left, high scores to the right. How are things for you? 

01:07:15
[sil.] 

01:07:20
CALVIN Four would be? 

01:07:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, sure. 

01:07:20
CALVIN Four. 

01:07:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. I love that. 

01:07:25
CALVIN This was... 

01:07:30
SCOTT MILLER How are things in your relationships, family, close, close relationships? 

01:07:35
CALVIN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. The, the one still. 

01:07:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay, one. Work and school, friendships. 

01:07:50
CALVIN Work, hmm, like four. 

01:07:55
SCOTT MILLER Four? 

01:07:55
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

01:07:55
SCOTT MILLER And then this is overall, either kind of an averages or something that might not be captured by the other areas. 

01:08:05
CALVIN Ah, ah, ah, a three. 

01:08:10
SCOTT MILLER Three? Okay. 

01:08:10
CALVIN Yeah, three. 

01:08:10
SCOTT MILLER Three. Perfect. Perfect. And we can add those together. Would you like to do that, or would you like me to do it? 

01:08:15
CALVIN Yeah, I can, I can - that's five, twelve. 

01:08:25
SCOTT MILLER Twelve. 

01:08:25
CALVIN I write it here? 

01:08:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, sure. 

01:08:25
CALVIN Twelve. 

01:08:30
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. And then right underneath there, and I kinda like the way you did this, uhm, where you actually put the number, we can, we actually can also use a ruler, ah, sometimes but you did the work for me. You wrote the number. I can get a ruler, 'cause each one of these lines is, is 10 cm. long. But, you know, this makes the work even easier. 

01:08:55
CALVIN Good. 

01:08:55
SCOTT MILLER uhm, and, ah, now would you like to keep this paper or, or me to keep it in that chart? 

01:09:00
CALVIN You're gonna keep it in a place. 

01:09:05
SCOTT MILLER In that place? Perfect. 

01:09:05
CALVIN Sure. 

01:09:05
SCOTT MILLER I, I'll do that. My, I'll do that. You remember last time, here's that graph and here's the line. 

01:09:15
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

01:09:15
SCOTT MILLER Ah, and you were saying last time you marked the form it was about a ten. 

01:09:20
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:09:25
SCOTT MILLER This time, a twelve. 

01:09:25
CALVIN Twelve. 

01:09:30
SCOTT MILLER Things have moved up a smidgen. 

01:09:30
CALVIN It did better. 

01:09:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:09:30
CALVIN I'm closer to the line. 

01:09:35
SCOTT MILLER We're closer to the line. 

01:09:35
CALVIN Uh-hmm. 

01:09:35
SCOTT MILLER And so that would mean we're about right, let's see here. Session two, we're about right here. And if we kinda con-- connect those points, you're right. We're heading... 

01:09:45
CALVIN It goes up. 

01:09:50
Take care to connect client ORS scores to his felt experience 

01:09:50
SCOTT MILLER It went up, and do-- does that fit with your experience of this last three days, that things are, uhm, that's my word, a, a smidgen - 

01:10:00
to confirm any changes as real form the client's point of view 

01:10:05
CALVIN Yeah, smidgen better. 

01:10:05
SCOTT MILLER - better? 

01:10:05
SCOTT MILLER They are? 

01:10:05
CALVIN Yeah. 

01:10:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm.

Miller, Ph.D. and Julie Tilsen, Ph.D. Working with Joanne a client mandated to treatment. 

01:11:30
SCOTT MILLER This next segment with Joanne is one of my favorites. It features a person who was arrested because of drunk driving, ah, and in sentenced to treatment by the courts as I travelled around at the county and even the world talking with therapists working with clients who are forced into treatment is a very common occurrence and present some unique challenges as a clinician. The ORS and the SRS can really help form a solid bond with the client and can also be used facilitate dialogue, uhm, creation of possibilities and, ah, solutions, so pay close attention. I worked hard at creating a culture feedback with this person who is forced to come to treatment and then the segment also illustrates how you can use the clinical cut off, the client now surprisingly has been sent to treatment forced mandated in the care. And here scores are above the clinical cut off. What is she saying? She is saying that life is actually pretty good. So what's the challenge for the clinician? What are we supposed to work on here if life is so good. I think traditionally we might, ah, confront the client and, ah, try to present a different story to them. In their opinion however that is the clients, we're going to be siding with the court, uhm, which is not likely to endear us, ah, to that particular person or engaged them in the treatment process. First scores are above the clinician cut off. And so I'd say help me understand how the court would view this because, she is there to fulfill the obligation of the courts into his lean off and I think quite commonly the scores she says, for the court would be much lower. The question simply becomes then if she want to fulfill the obligation of the court, somehow our work together has to have the court seen her like she sees herself. And that's really what the segment illustrates. 

01:13:30
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, Joanne. 

01:13:35
JOANNE Yes? 

01:13:35
SCOTT MILLER Is it, is it okay if I call you Joanne? 

01:13:40
JOANNE Well, of course its okay to call me Joanne. 

01:13:40
SCOTT MILLER Ah, well, you know, I don't ever want to assume, please call me Scott. 

01:13:45
JOANNE Sure. 

01:13:45
SCOTT MILLER Is it okay? 

01:13:45
JOANNE That's fine too. 

01:13:45
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. 

01:13:45
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:13:45
Introducing FIT "We work a bit differently..." 

01:13:45
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, thanks for coming in today, uhm, and, uhm, you know, I told you a bit on the phone about how we work a little differently, ah, then some psychologist, therapist do. 

01:14:00
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:14:00
Introducing "culture of feedback" We will know sooner rather than later 

01:14:00
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, we're very much driven by what you would like us to do, how-- what you would like to accomplish here. And so, each time we meet, uhm, I actually ask folks for some feedback to let us know are you getting what you came for here. And if not, then I will change and adjust and adapt to see if I can be of help. Sometimes it's not always but sometimes I am not the guy who knows how to help. And the key here is will know that sooner rather than later we can figure out, uhm, guest or someone help or some place helps, we need to get involve or you can go to, to get the help you need. Uhm, sort of like the idea that if same thing, if you were visiting your physician, you know, that one physician doesn't know everything. And maybe you need someone else. Maybe not, but we'll check every time. Am I making some sense to you? 

01:15:05
JOANNE Yes, you are. 

01:15:05
Introducing the ORS 

01:15:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay, good, perfect. The way we monitor this is I, I actually have a very brief measurement, ah, scale, uhm, and it has you, ah, think back over the last week including today. 

01:15:20
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:20
SCOTT MILLER And rate how are your feeling in this various areas of your life. You, in your relationships - 

01:15:25
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:30
SCOTT MILLER - socially, work, school, friendships, and kind of overall. 

01:15:30
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:30
SCOTT MILLER And you, you do-- fill this up by its kind of like an, ah, ah, the line here from low to high. 

01:15:40
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:40
SCOTT MILLER Anywhere along the line or in between. Does this make sense to you? 

01:15:45
JOANNE Sure it does. 

01:15:45
SCOTT MILLER Perfect! And so would it be if you fill this out? 

01:15:45
JOANNE Sure! 

01:15:45
SCOTT MILLER Great. 

01:15:50
JOANNE All right. 

01:15:50
SCOTT MILLER And then I'll score it and I show you how we monitor and make sure that you... 

01:15:55
JOANNE You want me to at this top part? 

01:15:55
SCOTT MILLER You don't have to. 

01:15:55
JOANNE Okay, just this bottom? 

01:15:55
SCOTT MILLER But if you fill it out better, just the bottom. 

01:15:55
JOANNE Okay, great. Okay. 

01:16:00
SCOTT MILLER All right, thanks for filling that up. 

01:16:05
JOANNE Yeah. 

01:16:05
SCOTT MILLER And I actually have a ruler here. 

01:16:05
JOANNE Yeah. 

01:16:05
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, because this is how you score this, it's actually scorable. And then each time we meet, uhm, you can fill it out and we can kind of plot on this graph right here - 

01:16:20
JOANNE Okay. 

01:16:20
SCOTT MILLER - how things are for you. 

01:16:20
JOANNE Uh-huh. 

01:16:20
SCOTT MILLER And the idea is that if I'm helping then the scores will improve. 

01:16:25
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:16:25
SCOTT MILLER In case would, would and if not then that gives us an opportunity to talk and figure out what else we need to do. 

01:16:30
JOANNE Okay. 

01:16:35
SCOTT MILLER All right, good enough. And so let me just show you here this is about a nine, I'm gonna mark this upside down, this is an eight and a-half, this is a seven and a half, and again this is about a nine. So now this is the hard part adding it up, so don't, ah, watch too close for here, nine and nine. 

01:16:55
JOANNE You need calculator? 

01:16:55
SCOTT MILLER I, I would, I would that would actually help me, nine and nine, 18 plus eight point five, 26.5, and if I get this this numbers wrong you tell me. Zero, seven point five, 14, 34, that are 34. 

01:17:10
JOANNE Great. 

01:17:10
SCOTT MILLER And, uhm, then we take that score of 34. 

01:17:15
JOANNE Right. 

01:17:15
SCOTT MILLER And we plot it on this graph here. 

01:17:15
JOANNE Uh-huh. 

01:17:20
SCOTT MILLER We're here at the first time. 

01:17:20
JOANNE Yep. 

01:17:20
SCOTT MILLER And your score is gonna be right about here. 

01:17:25
Plotting and explaining the scores 

01:17:25
JOANNE Okay. 

01:17:25
SCOTT MILLER And, uhm, the, the score of course goes from zero to 40, uhm, and your score is above this heavy thick dash line. 

01:17:35
JOANNE What does that mean? 

01:17:35
SCOTT MILLER Well, you know, people who are scoring above this line right here is a cut off are scoring more like people who are not in treatment, and who are saying, you know, life is actually fairly good. 

01:17:50
JOANNE Which is the case? 

01:17:50
SCOTT MILLER Which is the case. Sometimes people also who scoring above this line, their lives are going relatively well but they might have one kind of specific problem or concern - 

01:18:00
JOANNE Okay. 

01:18:00
SCOTT MILLER - that are coming in with. Does that make any sense to you? 

01:18:05
JOANNE So far. 

01:18:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And sense they are very high - 

01:18:10
JOANNE Okay. 

01:18:10
SCOTT MILLER - and you are saying life is going relatively well, so one of the obvious question here is, what brings you in? What would, what would make you come to see a person like me? 

01:18:20
Using clinical cut-off to explore client's goals and preferences 

01:18:20
JOANNE Well, uhm, I'm not really sure why they would have me come here - 

01:18:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

01:18:30
JOANNE - but, uhm... 

01:18:35
SCOTT MILLER I'm just gonna take some notes, I have a really bad memory. Ah, ba-- by the way you are welcome to take any of this with you if you want, make copies of it, ah - 

01:18:40
JOANNE Sure. 

01:18:40
SCOTT MILLER - you have to just ask for me. 

01:18:45
JOANNE Sure. 

01:18:45
SCOTT MILLER So they, they, they you are not what you are-- what they want. 

01:18:45
JOANNE Yeah. This, this, you know, I had a night out with some friends - 

01:18:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:18:50
JOANNE - who is totally normal.

JOANNE Probably, you know, during the yellow part. 

01:19:40

So, if they were to fill this out then i-- i-- if, if like the judge or the person you dealt with the court, you're, you're saying things are really good, uhm, oh-- where do you think they would fill it out? Because obviously you have to come here and satisfy them. That's what you're saying, I'm willing to be sa-- I'm gonna do this, I wanna get this out of the way. Am I right? 

01:22:50
JOANNE Right. 

01:22:50
SCOTT MILLER Right, so somehow whether they have to begin or be able to ion whatever reports we write they have to be able to se-- believe that things are as you say. 

01:23:00
JOANNE Okay. 

01:23:00
SCOTT MILLER Is that right? 

01:23:00
JOANNE They're gonna put me here. 

01:23:05
SCOTT MILLER All right. 

01:23:05
JOANNE I don't know what? Maybe... 

01:23:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

01:23:15
JOANNE Maybe. 

01:23:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

01:23:15
JOANNE That's what they do. 

01:23:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay, okay. 

01:23:20
JOANNE Of course. 

01:23:20
SCOTT MILLER Let, let's just take this and I, I can basically guess at this numbers but obviously it's lower, right? So this is, ah, two point five, about a three, a, ah, let's just call it a three. And, ah, one point five. So, we've got five point five plus three is eight point five. So they see you down here as a ten. 

01:23:45
JOANNE Yeah, well how else? 

01:23:45
SCOTT MILLER This is significantly different than you see yourself. 

01:23:50
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:23:50
Exploring client preferences: how do they prefer to be viewed/seen/experienced 

01:23:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. All right. So, here we are, they see you here you have to come here for as long as they think you need to be here to do whatever it is they think you were supposed to do. 

01:24:00
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:24:00
SCOTT MILLER You're saying let's get this thing done. 

01:24:05
JOANNE Sure. 

01:24:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. So, my question is, uhm, what do you suppose its gonna take to have them see things like you do? What is it they don't know about you that you know about yourself? That if, they begin to know that part of you, that they would, they-- their scores would be different? What, what, what would they know about you? You have given me some, for example you said, you know, everybody has a party, everybody has friends, that's what they would know about me. This isn't you said you don't drink that much. 

01:24:40
JOANNE Yeah. 

01:24:40
SCOTT MILLER This isn't a regular occurrence. 

01:24:40
JOANNE What else would they know about you? 

01:24:45
Joanne and the SRS 

01:24:50
SCOTT MILLER In this next section Joanne and I, ah, complete the SRS. I give it to her to try to create a culture of feedback and in this particular instance gives me some very pointed feedback. Ah, it's critical I think to watch how, ah, passionate she feels about it and then my response to that feedback because even though I didn't intend what was experienced it is the effect of my behavior that matters most. She also gives me very specific feedback like continuing the conversation with her about how I can improve what happens and how she experiences the work together. 

01:25:35
SCOTT MILLER Ah, Joanne as I told you at the beginning of the visit, ah, uhm, I, I really, uhm, interested in your feedback both about how life is for you and, uhm, also how you experienced the time we have together. 

01:25:50
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:25:50
Introducing the SRS 

01:25:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, whether its helpful, whether you feel like I'm getting it or not. And so I have one other brief scale that I take I swear, dead serious, uhm, ah, and I'd asks, ah, ah, ah, for you to tend of rate again low to the left, high to the right in this four areas about the work we did here today. 

01:26:10
JOANNE Uh-huh. 

01:26:10
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, one about our relationship? Did you feel that I heard, understood and respected you or not? 

01:26:15
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:26:15
SCOTT MILLER Whether we talked about, whether not we talked about what you wanted to talk about? My approach, well do you feel like it was a fit for you? And overall whether it was complete, they'll complete or something was missing. Does this make, make sense to you? 

01:26:35
JOANNE Yes, it does. 

01:26:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:26:40
JOANNE Already. 

01:26:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:26:40
JOANNE Yup! 

01:26:40
SCOTT MILLER And it scored essentially that exact same way, uhm, so, ah, okay. And, uhm, ten plus 16, so, uhm, this, this is actually the score is about a 34. 

01:27:05
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:27:05
SCOTT MILLER And if we put that on the graph here - 

01:27:10
JOANNE Okay. 

01:27:10
SCOTT MILLER - uhm, you're gonna see that, uhm, ah, that's right it's the graph again, ah, its, its right below this dotted line. 

01:27:20
JOANNE Uh-huh. 

01:27:20
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, so we'll just put it right here and that's your SRS this is where the court you were on the SRS. 

01:27:30
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:27:30
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, and so, uhm, this is your SRS score and if its below this dotted line - 

01:27:35
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:27:35
SCOTT MILLER - uhm, ah, sometimes it means that there are things that you would like to have different about what we did here. 

01:27:45
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:27:45
Setting the stage for negative feedback 

01:27:45
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, making it to be large things that seemed to go completely wrong although most of the time it's the, it's not at some small thing the word, something I did, ah, that would be better if we changed it or did it different in the future for you. 

01:28:00
JOANNE Uh-huh. 

01:28:00
SCOTT MILLER Is there anything at all that you can put your finger on that, that you'd like to be different next time? 

01:28:10
JOANNE Well, uhm, I mean a phrases in a question. Do you realize that I probably have the same amount of education that you do? 

01:28:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. I-- 

01:28:25
JOANNE Do you know what I'm saying? 

01:28:30
SCOTT MILLER I think so, yes. 

01:28:30
JOANNE That I'm smart, okay? 

01:28:35
SCOTT MILLER Hmm, hmm, hmm. 

01:28:35
JOANNE And, uhm, one thing that I would probably change is to for you to see that I'm just as smart as you - 

01:28:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:28:40
JOANNE - and you don't have to like explain yourself a whole lot. 

01:28:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:28:45
JOANNE Because I'm not dumb. 

01:28:50
SCOTT MILLER All right, okay. 

01:28:50
JOANNE You see? 

01:28:50
SCOTT MILLER All right. 

01:28:50
JOANNE Yeah. 

01:28:50
SCOTT MILLER And so some other way I was explaining things, you, you're talking about the forms or in the visit or the entire it felt like I was, ah, I was talking down to you? 

01:29:00
JOANNE Uhm, a li-- probably overall. 

01:29:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:29:05
JOANNE I just don't, I, I just don't know. 

01:29:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:29:05
JOANNE Like that's why I'm like asking. 

01:29:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:29:10
JOANNE Like, do you? 

01:29:10
SCOTT MILLER I don't really know I didn't ask any questions about your education. But what's critical for me is that you told me, I, I feel, I feel grateful for that. 

01:29:20
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:29:20
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, because I think it would be easy, e specially if I missed that - 

01:29:25
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:29:25
SCOTT MILLER - to leave and think, you know, here's another guy who doesn't see it like me, doesn't know what is like top live on my skin. And I feel a little bit on the outside. 

01:29:35
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:29:35
SCOTT MILLER So, ah, I'm really quite grateful that would say. Gives me a chance to learn, to grow and expand and that's what I like to do. 

01:29:40
JOANNE Oh, good. 

01:29:45
SCOTT MILLER Is that okay? 

01:29:45
JOANNE Yeah. Okay. 

01:29:45
SCOTT MILLER Now I wanna make sure that I don't do that, I want you to know that in my head, I wasn't thinking that at all. 

01:29:50
JOANNE Okay. 

01:29:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, but that doesn't matter, what matters is how you experience this. 

01:29:55
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:29:55
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, and I have had a similar experience before actually multiple times where it feels like people don't quite get me or their thinking of me in a way that doesn't fit with my perception and what I know - 

01:30:10
JOANNE Okay. 

01:30:10
SCOTT MILLER - about myself. 

01:30:10
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:30:10
SCOTT MILLER So I wanna make sure that you be willing to tell me that just like you've done here now. Tell me early that you're doing it again, would you be willing to do that? 

01:30:20
JOANNE Sure. 

01:30:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay, ah, because then, then we get a chance of, uhm, of me correcting it and learning, uhm, each person is different, uhm, and, ah, once I get to know them a bit, uhm, I'm willing to bend and flex. 

01:30:35
JOANNE Okay. 

01:30:35
SCOTT MILLER Is that all right? 

01:30:35
JOANNE That's fine. 

01:30:35
SCOTT MILLER Now did you get any impression from the court how often they were hoping we would need to. Do you have a sense of that whether you like to meet in a week or two weeks, try to get this taken care of, spread it out, you have any sense of that? 

01:30:50
JOANNE Uhm, what I'd like to do is get it taking care of very quickly. 

01:30:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay, okay. Of course. 

01:30:55
JOANNE So, uhm, I think this that I had like three or four sessions - 

01:30:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay, perfect. 

01:30:55
JOANNE - or something like that. 

01:31:00
SCOTT MILLER Good. 

01:31:00
JOANNE Then if we can just do those once a week can be done in the month that would be fantastic. 

01:31:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay, perfect. Then let's take a look at my book - 

01:31:05
JOANNE Great. 

01:31:05
SCOTT MILLER - to make sure that gets you in the book for a week. 

01:31:10
JOANNE Great. 

01:31:10
SCOTT MILLER All right, thanks Joanne. 

01:31:10
JOANNE No problem. 

01:31:15
3. Learn to "fail successfully" 

01:31:20
SCOTT MILLER As we said, ah, in the introductory part to this video series, it happens about 50% of the time that what we do doesn't work for a particular client and in this case with Joanne we've have established, ah, really nice working relationship that has gone nowhere. She has not achieved what she has hoped to achieved and in fact matters have worsen for here. And so we have conversation about what else we could do either together by adding other resources or by sending her elsewhere to achieve what is very important to her. 

01:32:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay, Joanne, so, uhm, as you can see, ah, the scores have, have gone down again since last week. Uhm, and, ah, so what, I mean things are, things you're saying here are, are, ah, not so good. 

01:32:20
JOANNE Okay. All right. 

01:32:25
SCOTT MILLER Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out, so... 

01:32:25
JOANNE Right, right. 

01:32:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, what's - 

01:32:30
JOANNE Right. 

01:32:30
SCOTT MILLER - what's happening? 

01:32:35
JOANNE Things feel like they're closing in. 

01:32:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm, okay. 

01:32:40
JOANNE Like I'm not as, like I'm affected by things - 

01:32:45
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm, okay. 

01:32:45
JOANNE - a lot easier - 

01:32:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:32:45
JOANNE - and more sensitive to them. 

01:32:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:32:50
JOANNE Not like before. 

01:32:50
SCOTT MILLER And do you feel like that's a result of something we've done here to open you up to be too sensitive to things, or things just in your life, feeling like they are more out of control or more. 

01:33:00
JOANNE I think, I really don't know - 

01:33:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:33:00
JOANNE - I think its a little, both. 

01:33:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:33:05
JOANNE Uhm, I before here really wasn't thinking about things the way - 

01:33:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:33:05
JOANNE - that I've started thinking about them. 

01:33:10
SCOTT MILLER All right, all right. And I mean as you can see we started in a very different place appear around a 34 I think it was if I remember that first visit, right. 

01:33:20
JOANNE Yeah. Uh-hmm. 

01:33:20
SCOTT MILLER And now we're down around that, how this, this time at 15. And it's kinda gonna up and down a little bit? 

01:33:25
JOANNE Right. 

01:33:30
SCOTT MILLER Like, uhm, ah, what you're telling me confirms what the score say which is that even if this isn't responsible for the way you're feeling completely its not neither is it helping you, in a way you'd, you'd hope. 

01:33:45
JOANNE Okay, yeah. 

01:33:45
SCOTT MILLER Does that feel right to you? 

01:33:50
JOANNE I don't want it too but yeah. 

01:33:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:33:50
JOANNE Yeah. 

01:33:50
SCOTT MILLER And, you know, ah, I, I want to make sure that you get what you come for and that you're feeling better and you say things are closing in on and then I start to wonder since we have met actually more times than originally said, remember in the beginning you said, I wanna get this done, get done in a month. And the things are kind of gone up and down and we extend it a bit to see if I could come up for something that might be more helpful to you. But in spite of what we been doing here things are still closing in for you. 

01:34:25
JOANNE Right, so what do you, what do you saying? 

01:34:25
SCOTT MILLER Well, I'm, I'm beginning to wonder as I've said before that it, I don't know everything and I'm not the be all and end all of treatment people. 

01:34:35
JOANNE Yeheey! You've learned. 

01:34:35
SCOTT MILLER That's right, I have, I have. And, you know, there are other options, there are other options available and I'm, I'm beginning to wonder if maybe we should explore those things. 

01:34:45
JOANNE You mean like not meet with you? 

01:34:50
SCOTT MILLER Either not meet with me or, uhm, continue to meet with me but add some other resources, some other options, some other kind of care. 

01:35:00
JOANNE What do you, what do you, what do you-- What would that look like? Like you mean... 

01:35:05
SCOTT MILLER Well that's the, that's the question really, that's the best question, what, what, what would it look like. But I wanna make sure that I'm, ah, because I get a sense that initially it feels like I'm really, I'm really bringing up a lot of stuff right here, right now. 

01:35:20
JOANNE Uh-hmm. 

01:35:20
SCOTT MILLER Can you say something about that? 

01:35:25
JOANNE Ah, you mean like what's going on right now? 

01:35:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:35:25
JOANNE Well, I'm, I, I really like surprisingly I like talking to you. 

01:35:30
SCOTT MILLER Thanks, makes you feel by the way. 

01:35:35
JOANNE Uhm, and, uhm, I, I see my life differently since I'd been talking to you. 

01:35:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:35:40
JOANNE So I don't, I don't wanna stop per se but I also, I don't know. It's confusing. 

01:35:50
SCOTT MILLER But-- okay. But at the same time you wouldn't object to adding something else that might be of help? 

01:36:00
JOANNE No, if it all get me where I'm supposed to be I, I'll do-- yeah, I need to do it. 

01:36:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay, because as you say things are closing in. And I can remember from last time you said some things about your mom and... 

01:36:15
JOANNE Oh, yeah, like the, uhm, you know, it's my brother and-- the, the main thing that my brother-in-law and he starting to get on my case - 

01:36:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:36:20
JOANNE - a lot and start to keep me my sister from talking. 

01:36:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:36:25
JOANNE And, yeah, my mom is sick a lot more and that's just stressful. 

01:36:30
SCOTT MILLER You know that the weight have mustered that has all of it really it's been on you the entire time. 

01:36:35
JOANNE Yeah, and... 

01:36:35
SCOTT MILLER And then work and such and so... 

01:36:40
JOANNE Yeah, uhm, yeah, work is, yeah, actually they called me in the office for some errors because I don't make errors. 

01:36:50
SCOTT MILLER All right I know, I know how important from the very first time you met me you said you were efficient. 

01:36:55
JOANNE Yeah. 

01:36:55
SCOTT MILLER And making an error does doesn't fit with who you are. 

01:37:00
JOANNE No. 

01:37:00
SCOTT MILLER All right. And so I wanna just return to this because, ah, again as I, as you said-- I actually kind of I, I, I, I, I've, I really enjoyed talking with you. I feel like I been learning a lot. 

01:37:10
JOANNE Well, me too. 

01:37:15
SCOTT MILLER And we probably do need to add some additional stuff at this point. 

01:37:20
JOANNE Okay. When-- what, what, what do you think? 

01:37:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:37:25
JOANNE What, uhm, what other options do you want to show me? 

01:37:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. That's the right question, that's exactly the right question. Let's, lets talk about those. 

01:37:35
JOANNE Go on. 

01:37:40
[sil.] 

01:37:45
Working with Multiple Scores: Mother and Daughter 

01:37:50
JULIE TILSEN In this next section, uhm, you gonna see me meeting at a first session with Susan and Frankie, Frankie is the 14 or 15 year old daughter of Susan. And, uhm, in a situation that is probably very familiar to many people that work with families, uhm, it was that the young persons idea to seek help, uhm, and so she, Frankie and Susan have very different ideas about what's going on. Uhm, so this is a demonstration of several things, one how to administer the ORS to more than one person, that's a common question we get in terms of, ah, the use of the measures, and keep in mind while this is a single parent with one child this could be, you know, a family with many kids, it could with many concerned others involved it could be a group. Uhm, so this is one demonstration and one instance of how to use the measures with more than one person in the room. And what you see when they mark the scores, what my efforts then are to begin now in continuing the culture of feedback but to begin to integrate two different scores into a conversation that has meaning and purpose for them. 

01:39:05
JULIE TILSEN All right, Susan, Frankie thanks for coming in. Uhm, Julie, Frankie of you didn't know that I know your mom and I had a chance to speak on phone briefly once you called for the appointment, okay. Uhm, we're gonna jump in to talking about whatever you guys would find helpful in a moment, uhm. 

01:39:20
SUSAN Okay. 

01:39:20
Creating a "culture of feedback" 

01:39:25
JULIE TILSEN But one of the things that I talk with your mom about on the phone is part of how I work, ah, is to be sure that I get from you guys a good sense of how you think things are for you. 

01:39:35
SUSAN Sure. 

01:39:35
JULIE TILSEN And so at the beginning of our conversation I'm gonna ask you guys to take a moment here to fill out a, a quick forms so that I hear from you, how things are going in your lives. And if we all make it together to the end of this hour, well stop again and I'll give you another quick form, I had to get some feedback from you guys about how this was for you, how I was for you, okay? 

01:39:55
SUSAN Okay. 

01:39:55
JULIE TILSEN So let me show you how this works, uhm, let's see well, we're color coded. Frankie am I, am I making assumption if I set you down with purple? Does that work for you? 

01:40:05
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:40:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay, cool. So, Frankie you can have that one, Susan I'll give you a blue one. 

01:40:10
SUSAN Excellent. 

01:40:10
Introducing the ORS 

01:40:10
JULIE TILSEN And what I have here, what's it was red, is, uhm, on each of this pages there is four lines and you see there was four areas individually into personal, social and overall. And what I'd like to ask each of you to do is thinking about-- thinking back over the last week or so including today, I'd like you to think about how things are going where marks more this side of line things are, are going very well. 

01:40:40
SUSAN Okay. 

01:40:40
Parents gives perspective on child's functioning on the ORS 

01:40:40
JULIE TILSEN Kind of suck, okay, marks to the right things are really cool, they're awesome on a beach in Jamaica wherever you'd like to be, okay. Now for you Susan what I'd like you to do is if you called with a concern about Frankie don't mark this like how you're doing in your life mark it how you think she is doing. 

01:41:00
SUSAN I think she doing okay. 

01:41:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:41:05
SUSAN All right. 

01:41:05
JULIE TILSEN It's kind of a gut check, it's sort of like, kind of this gut check for you guys, how are you doing and how's your world going, gut check for you how do you think your kids doing. 

01:41:10
SUSAN Okay. 

01:41:10
Feedback helps me help you 

01:41:10
JULIE TILSEN Take a moment with that and when you're done show that how that will help me, help you guys. Okay? 

01:41:15
SUSAN Okay, great. 

01:41:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay thanks to you guys. So what I'm gonna do is, uhm, each of this four lines is ten centimeters long, so I'm gonna mark em up. Hmm. Gonna mark them up if I get my pen to cooperate. And Susan we have here two, and one point five and to, four. And this is a one four, so two three four five six and what's eight and five Frankie? 

01:41:55
FRANKIE Thirteen. 

01:41:55
JULIE TILSEN Thirteen, so that's seven point three, uhm, so set that one aside for a sec. and Frankie and, you know, just looking at this is I fear I've say you guys kind of have a wildly and different opinion on how things are going. 

01:42:10
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:42:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. 

01:42:10
SUSAN That's okay, the problem. 

01:42:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, that's become part of the problem Susan? Is that what you're saying? 

01:42:15
SUSAN Yes. Seems to be. 

01:42:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. 

01:42:15
SUSAN Not seeing things eye to eye right now. 

01:42:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay, not seeing things eye to eye. 

01:42:20
FRANKIE She is crazy. 

01:42:25
JULIE TILSEN Oh, okay. Hold that thought, okay. All right, so ten and 15 would be 25.7. So really different perspective and so what we do you guys is that, I just have this very simple graph. 

01:42:40
SUSAN Okay. 

01:42:40
JULIE TILSEN And, uhm, well we're color coded, uhm, Susan you were blue, right? 

01:42:40
SUSAN Yes. 

01:42:45
JULIE TILSEN So seven point three would be right about here. 

01:42:45
SUSAN Okay. 

01:42:45
Explaining the use of the scores 

01:42:45
JULIE TILSEN So this is Susan. And show this a minute we got Frankie is purple, and Frankie you put yourself at a 25.7, which is up here. So what we do is like I said this first session is like a, like a gut check and it serves as an anchor point. As we meet again, if we were to meet again, we'll do this every time we meet and we wanna see things getting better from your perspective. 

01:43:15
SUSAN Okay. The number is getting closer together? 

01:43:20
JULIE TILSEN No-- well, that maybe one thing that would be, if, if, if for you Susan that might be the way to think about things improving that you guys have worn the same page. 

01:43:25
SUSAN See more eye to eye. 

01:43:30
JULIE TILSEN See more eye to eye. 

01:43:30
SUSAN Okay. 

01:43:30
Making meaning of scores 

01:43:30
JULIE TILSEN See more eye to eye maybe that when their differences such as a gap between them - 

01:43:35
SUSAN Yeah. 

01:43:35
JULIE TILSEN Sounds like is this never almost like metaphor. 

01:43:40
SUSAN Right. 

01:43:40
JULIE TILSEN So the goal could exist to the team between you guys right now, do you know what I mean by that? Sort of like, this grand canyon between you and your mom right now. 

01:43:50
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:43:50
JULIE TILSEN Do you ever feel like you, you're gonna fall in? Or you wanna push her in? 

01:43:55
SUSAN That might be more accurate. 

01:43:55
JULIE TILSEN That might be more accurate, okay. So, perhaps getting closer together but also getting higher. 

01:44:00
SUSAN Okay. 

01:44:00
JULIE TILSEN So from your perspective not mine, or another experts or whatever the doctor or the teachers perspective the things are moving as you define them better. 

01:44:10
SUSAN Okay. 

01:44:10
Alliance: clarifying goals and purposes 

01:44:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay? Uhm, so that's, that's kind of what this serve this is anchor point just for a second. Now you said Susan that, uhm, you are not seeing eye to eye and that, that would be kind of a, a goal for you to see eye to eye? 

01:44:25
SUSAN Yes, just check on to maybe but more than understanding or sense of agreement about how she's doing and, and, and how I'm doing. 

01:44:35
JULIE TILSEN Okay, yeah. So seeing eye to eye and sense of agreement about how you're both doing? 

01:44:45
SUSAN Uh-hmm. 

01:44:45
Negotiating purpose and goals 

01:44:45
JULIE TILSEN Okay, and, you know, Frankie, uhm, and I want guess that purple, you're done of purple. Uhm, can I make another guess that, uhm, ah, you're thinking that well or that it was your mom's idea, its her thinking that brought you here today? 

01:45:05
FRANKIE Yeah, I don't see a problem. I think she is the problem I don't see why we're here. 

01:45:10
JULIE TILSEN You don't see why? So have you guys talk about that at all? 

01:45:15
FRANKIE She is just kind of blurted it out at times. 

01:45:15
JULIE TILSEN Oh, what was in the blurt that you caught? 

01:45:20
FRANKIE We don't understand each other, you're, you're acting different and I don't understand it. 

01:45:25
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm, hmm. 

01:45:25
FRANKIE I don't see what's different, my scores are high she is the one who needs to get up. 

01:45:30
Engaging multiple scores: soliciting client descriptions 

01:45:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So when I-- so for you almost certainly this is what the problems is, is that she doesn't see you as you see you? 

01:45:40
FRANKIE I guess so. 

01:45:40
JULIE TILSEN Oh, ah, ah, I don't wanna put word in your mouth I'm wondering how, how would you say it? 

01:45:45
FRANKIE Ah, she doesn't see what I see I guess. 

01:45:50
JULIE TILSEN Doesn't see what you see. 

01:45:50
FRANKIE I think my eye is the right eye and her eye needs to see to my eye. 

01:45:55
JULIE TILSEN I see, okay. So when you go eye to eye you want her eye to come to your eye? 

01:46:00
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:46:00
Continuing "culture of feedback": goals and purposes 

01:46:00
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Okay, I see. And, uhm, Frankie if your could imagine this scores getting closer together were whether its moms eye getting to your eye, or maybe you guys creating some third eyes, some people ways of seeing together. Uhm, well if you imagine that you were seeing more eye to eye like your mom says, uhm, would you feel like there is less of the problem? 

01:46:25
FRANKIE I didn't knew and think there was a problem. 

01:46:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. So that's why I'm wondering is, is this kind of what the problem is that you guys don't see eye to eye like your mom said, would you agree on that? 

01:46:40
FRANKIE I guess. 

01:46:40
JULIE TILSEN Guess, what part of that maybe is agreeable, what part of that you're going, no? 

01:46:45
FRANKIE Well, obviously there's a problem because if there not a problem so we fix our problem then there's a problem. 

01:46:50
JULIE TILSEN Right, okay, so the problem is that she is thinking there's a problem. 

01:46:55
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:46:55
JULIE TILSEN Okay, all right. 

01:46:55
SUSAN We have this discussion it's just keep turn around and around, uhm, but - 

01:47:00
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, uhm, yeah. 

01:47:00
SUSAN - I notice the difference and she doesn't and, and we just can't quite seem to get to, to how to fix it. 

01:47:10
JULIE TILSEN This next vignette is the end of this first session so I'm giving the SRS, the Session Rating Scale and so again what its demonstrating is administration to more than one person and its demonstrating, ah, what to do when people in the room have different experiences of the session. But before I can get to that what I find out, ah, something that commonly happens in a family or couples session is that one family member rates her experience based on how it was for her with the other family member. Kind of Frankie rated mom and, and rather me or the session. And, uhm, I, I check that she was clear and I find out that she was confused about that, so I re-explain it, but I'm also really clear to say, hey, my bad, I wasn't clear, uhm, you know, it's my responsibility to be clear and makes you people understand what we're doing. So she re-scores it and then what this becomes, uhm, a process said is continuing with the culture of feedback trying to solicit from Frankie in particular, cause she is the one I wasn't feeling really good about the session, uhm, what we could do definitely next time so that it had meaning purpose, uhm, ah, utility for her, ah, and so we come up with some ideas and sort of a plan for the next session. 

01:48:40
JULIE TILSEN Can you-- so we're about to the end of the session here and, uhm, you know, I appreciate the conversation we've had around, uhm, this ideas of seeing eye to eye, trying to see things together, seeing each other's perspectives, uhm, maybe going somewhere else to have a different views, sometimes. 

01:49:00
SUSAN Yeah. 

01:49:00
Introducing the SRS 

01:49:00
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, and, uhm, one of the things I'd like to do now is get you to tell me how you saw this time together. 

01:49:05
SUSAN Okay. 

01:49:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay, uhm, cuz like I said at the beginning, uhm, at the beginning we did the, the first form, how you guys feel like its going in your life. I'd like to know how you saw this, how this went for you. So let me make sure you get the right pen for the right person. Frankie, ah, you haven't changed from purple over last 45 or 50 minutes have you? Or its still okay marking in purple? Okay, uhm, so here is the purple pen is my hand. So he-- takes this just for second and I explain it let me get one for your mom, and she is using blue. Okay, so this form its a session rating scale, and what this does is give you an opportunity to give me some feedback so that I can, ah, best help you. And again on each of those fault lines if you would make a mark where mark more than this side of the page is like those comments and things weren't going very well. 

01:50:05
FRANKIE Okay. 

01:50:05
JULIE TILSEN I didn't hear you, this wasn't a good productive use of our time. Uhm, something was missing and more, much more the right at the page, it was being on, this was helpful, productive, meaningful, I got you, you got me. It was good, okay. 

01:50:20
FRANKIE Okay. 

01:50:20
JULIE TILSEN So you take a moment with that. 

01:50:20
SUSAN Great. 

01:50:25
JULIE TILSEN So, again they're ten centimeters I'm gonna mark them up and, uhm, we'll keep them on the same graph - 

01:50:30
SUSAN Okay. 

01:50:30
JULIE TILSEN - I will just instead of dot I use an X to distinguished which is which, so be nine here, hmm. Always be better do this with my glasses but we'll get by, uhm, okay, and again, okay. So, nine, nine, nine, is 36, so 37 Susan. Uhm, and Frankie it looks like, uhm, you know, Susan I'm wondering how do you think Frankie felt about this meeting, do you have any sense? 

01:51:05
SUSAN Well, I, I caught a glimpse of her paper. 

01:51:10
JULIE TILSEN You caught a glimpse, okay. 

01:51:10
SUSAN Just knowing her personality I didn't drag her here, kicking and screaming but she wasn't terribly thrilled about it a bit. 

01:51:15
JULIE TILSEN She wasn't thrilled. 

01:51:15
SUSAN I hope maybe, hopefully you're a little more positive about it. 

01:51:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:51:25
SUSAN Maybe after another few days of thinking about it maybe, we'll get from where. 

01:51:25
Acknowledging negative feedback 

01:51:30
JULIE TILSEN Seven point one, so generally Frankie on a suck-o-meter(ph) this really blow-junks(ph) for you? 

01:51:35
FRANKIE Well, I mean, she, we didn't do anything like she is not any better, she is not doing anything different she didn't learn anything. 

01:51:45
JULIE TILSEN She didn't learn anything. So, is not-- its like you're not walking out any different than you're walking in? You think - 

01:51:55
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:51:55
Therapist accountable for clear explanation 

01:51:55
JULIE TILSEN - you're not taking something a way different, now can I ask you a question? Cause I may screwed up and not then a good job of explaining this to you, uhm, when you were thinking about making the marks on this, on this scales we're you thinking about how she was for you? 

01:52:10
FRANKIE Yeah, I thought you wanted to. 

01:52:15
Re-explaining the SRS and providing chance to re-score 

01:52:15
JULIE TILSEN Oh, no my bet, my bet, can you think about like how I did like how was I in terms of hearing you? 

01:52:25
FRANKIE I think you... 

01:52:25
JULIE TILSEN And, and, and, you know, how was, in terms of the goals and the topics my ability to help us talk about things that mattered to you, approach the method, how I went about doing that? By asking enough questions, not enough, I talk too much, not enough and overall, so if you were to think about it in those terms would, would you re-mark it, oh, blue pen. Purple. And, and Susan for you, you un-- did I? Was I clear for you? 

01:52:50
Client giving specific suggestions for session 

01:52:50
SUSAN Yes, I thought like we were starting to talk about the things that Frankie and I need to talk about and, and being able to start seeing eye to eye, and what I would like is, you know, more of that time to really be able to figure out how we can come together a bit more. 

01:53:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, okay. 

01:53:10
SUSAN That's by meeting helps. 

01:53:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, so for you this session you felt like I was on the right track, I was eye to eye with you? 

01:53:20
SUSAN I, I felt like that. 

01:53:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay, okay. 

01:53:20
FRANKIE I think, I think you were fine. 

01:53:20
JULIE TILSEN I was fine, okay. 

01:53:20
FRANKIE I was... 

01:53:20
Therapists seeking client suggestions 

01:53:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay, so I can definitely see Frankie that this is a whole lot different than the first scos-- scores but I'm still kind of wondering what would make this time feel like it was more useful for you, like perhaps you were living with something different, uhm, if, if it were just a little bit better each of this new mark went even a little more to this direction, what might I be doing differently or, or what can we do differently together? 

01:53:50
Client states preferences 

01:53:55
FRANKIE Well, I think that your method was good but the ones that said, ah, I talked about what I wanna talk about and, ah, the ones that said I felt like I said what I needed to say. I didn't, I put those lower - 

01:54:10
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

01:54:10
FRANKIE - because, ah, I don't think we, we did much here. 

01:54:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm, Uh-hmm. 

01:54:15
SUSAN You know, I think we came to an agreement, yeah? 

01:54:15
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:54:15
Negotiating means and methods 

01:54:20
JULIE TILSEN So, you know, in terms of ways to try to do that I'm wondering, uhm, do, do either do you have any ideas or, do you want me to take about some ideas about how to do that differently? 

01:54:30
SUSAN Just felt kind of it a losses to, you know, just seems I'm going down this road and she going down this road and - 

01:54:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:54:40
SUSAN - and we've tried to communicate and it just, it just seems like - 

01:54:40
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

01:54:40
SUSAN - we're both heading a, a brick wall. 

01:54:45
Getting specific 

01:54:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Uhm, well certainly, you know, some things we could maybe talk about doing, uhm, would be maybe splitting the time up, uhm, I can meet some with you, I can meet some with you and I wanted to work to bringing it together. Uhm, you know, Frankie you said it would that-- you can feel like we talked about or worked on the things you wanted to. Uhm, guess my ideas what some of those things might be that you've like to talk about? 

01:55:10
FRANKIE Well, ah, I think it might be more useful if we had our separate sessions and not together because she is scary and I'm not. And probably if we talked just with me and you I could talk more about what I think about her. 

01:55:30
Reflecting back and clarifying clients preferences 

01:55:30
JULIE TILSEN And so what you're saying is maybe, maybe something we could try differently is, uhm, maybe me a little bit with your mom and me a little bit with you and then we try to all come back together again? 

01:55:40
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:55:40
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Could you... 

01:55:40
SUSAN I could be okay with that. 

01:55:45
JULIE TILSEN Okay. And you would said that you guys kinda go round and round anyway, so maybe that would be something different - 

01:55:50
SUSAN Yeah. 

01:55:50
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:55:50
JULIE TILSEN - to break it up. Okay, so we could look at making a, a next plan where was with the time up, uhm, or, or do something like that. 

01:56:00
SUSAN Okay. 

01:56:00
JULIE TILSEN All right, cool. Thanks for the idea. 

01:56:05
JULIE TILSEN So the next vignette is actually three sections, uhm, from, uhm, second session is, uhm, I meet with them together briefly, ah, because what you'll ha-- we'll have seen is what came out of the first meeting the ideas that they wanted to take up, ah, were to meet separately for a bit. But I meet with them first and we score the ORS together and, uhm, checking around then and beginning integrating some of this feedback into care because its sort of, uhm, taken off with some of the stuff we had talked about in particular with the measure had become meaningful for them. Uhm, but also what I was doing was while we had made a plan at the end of the first session based on Frankie's feedback, what she wanted to do. I didn't wanna assume that, that still held, you know, things happen to any close of a week or so. So I said, you guys still wanna do? And they said, yes. And so that plan was to meet separately a bit. So the next video what you'll see is I'm gonna meet with mom alone, Susan and you'll also see then what this is a demonstration of is re-scoring the ORS from a different perspective now that I'm meeting alone with mom. Then you'll see me meeting a bit wit Frankie alone and, ah, we use the measures in a, integrating with the care, because Frankie is really grabbed on to them, and can organize yourself around the numbers and what I mean its become a language for her, ah, where there is sort, ah, uhm, share its faith with her mom. And so, what the section with vignette with Frankie is demonstrated is how we're continued to integrate that, uhm, ah, and move forward, ah, in a way that has meaning for her and her mom together. 

01:57:55
JULIE TILSEN Susan, Frankie welcome back, uhm - 

01:57:55
SUSAN Thank you. 

01:58:00
JULIE TILSEN - I recalling that when we finished last time we talked about trying to do something a little different with the time based on some of the feedback Frankie you gave - 

01:58:10
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:58:10
JULIE TILSEN - around maybe splitting us up, right? Is that something you guys would still, still like to do? 

01:58:15
SUSAN I think so. 

01:58:15
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:58:15
SUSAN I, I, I'm open to it and if, ah - 

01:58:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:58:20
SUSAN - that were cool for Frankie then we should it a go. 

01:58:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay, well before we do that, let me grab this. Uhm, you guys remember how I asked you at the beginning of our first meeting about, uhm, how things are going and - 

01:58:35
SUSAN Uh-hmm. 

01:58:35
JULIE TILSEN - to, to, uhm, use this forms. 

01:58:40
SUSAN Okay. 

01:58:40
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

01:58:40
SUSAN Yes. 

01:58:40
JULIE TILSEN Remind again, purple, blue that still work? Any new color this week Frankie? 

01:58:45
FRANKIE I'm good. 

01:58:45
JULIE TILSEN Are you gotta plans to change the hair? 

01:58:50
FRANKIE Ah, not, not yet, I just had this, I just, ah, this one. 

01:58:55
JULIE TILSEN That's pretty new so? 

01:58:55
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:58:55
JULIE TILSEN Okay, what do you think might come up to purple? 

01:59:00
FRANKIE Uhm, thicken blue. 

01:59:00
JULIE TILSEN Blue? Like, what kind of blue? 

01:59:00
FRANKIE Uhm, you know, dark blue. 

01:59:05
JULIE TILSEN Dark? 

01:59:05
FRANKIE And red before this. 

01:59:05
JULIE TILSEN Really? 

01:59:05
FRANKIE Yeah. 

01:59:05
JULIE TILSEN Ah, what was your favorite? None of them? 

01:59:10
SUSAN If she likes it then, then I like it, I think its fun. 

01:59:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, okay. So there's a little eye to eye on that one. 

01:59:15
SUSAN Yeah. 

01:59:15
JULIE TILSEN Fantastic, okay. 

01:59:15
SUSAN As long as she doesn't shave it off. 

01:59:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay, so hand you that, will hand you that and if you could think about how things are going since we last talked. 

01:59:25
SUSAN Okay. 

01:59:25
2nd session ORS change over time vs. moment to moment 

01:59:25
JULIE TILSEN So overall not just right now today, please, you know, two hours ago I may have thought will I come and right now I feel great, you know, how we can go through that so overall sense the last thought how things are going, and Susan remember your scoring how to think Frankie is doing. 

01:59:45
SUSAN Okay. 

01:59:45
JULIE TILSEN Okay? 

01:59:45
SUSAN All right. 

01:59:45
Inviting conversation about scores: discussion trumps numbers 

01:59:50
JULIE TILSEN Frankie, okay. And I just wanna check this really quickly before we go our separate ways. Now Susan starting with you do you have a sense as, uhm, would you say you think its going about the same, a little better, a little worse? 

02:00:05
SUSAN Well I think I might be a little bit better we've been able to talk some during the last week. 

02:00:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

02:00:10
SUSAN Kind of about the use numbers and the scoring and - 

02:00:15
JULIE TILSEN The nu-- what numbers? 

02:00:15
SUSAN Well the scoring, ah... 

02:00:20
JULIE TILSEN These numbers? Really. 

02:00:20
SUSAN Yeah. Frankie has been, you know, taking allowed of... 

02:00:25
FRANKIE We have a system. 

02:00:25
JULIE TILSEN A system? 

02:00:25
Making meaning of scores 

02:00:25
FRANKIE I made this little system. 

02:00:25
SUSAN It kind of started as a joke but I think its working and she'll say like, ah, mom you kinda seem like you're, you know, a five or a six today and, and but maybe I'm feeling a little more like a four. Well, and we been able to talk about that a little bit. And that feels helpful to me. 

02:00:40
JULIE TILSEN So you're using the numbers as sort of a, a common language? 

02:00:45
FRANKIE Yes. 

02:00:45
JULIE TILSEN Some, ah, like a point of agreement? 

02:00:50
FRANKIE Yes. 

02:00:50
JULIE TILSEN I-- is that right Frankie? 

02:00:50
FRANKIE Yeah. 

02:00:50
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, what kind of differences that made? 

02:00:55
FRANKIE Ah, I think we're kind of recognizing that there is a problem and need to be fixed like, ah, last week when we came in, and I was kinda saying like there is no problem and that she was talking about - 

02:01:05
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

02:01:05
FRANKIE - and I still think that I'm right. 

02:01:10
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

02:01:10
FRANKIE And she's kinda think it wrong. 

02:01:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

02:01:10
FRANKIE But I see that the problem is that, that she is thinking it wrong and me to fix that. 

02:01:20
SUSAN That's been able to make us go if I can, if what I'm seeing is that she is lower on the end and I comment on that and she can say well actually I'm higher up and then we can talk about that a little bit. 

02:01:30
Comparings scores to lived experience 

02:01:30
JULIE TILSEN Okay, hold that thought cause I really suck at math and I can't do that and do that at the same time. So, but what I see here Susan is, is, is what your score here doesn't to be lining up with what you're talking about is, when you came in last week is like seven three. 

02:01:50
SUSAN Uh-hmm. 

02:01:50
JULIE TILSEN And now you're up to 12 and its up, its as if you really-- but you seem to be describing something that is feels freezing up in your life - 

02:01:55
SUSAN Yes. 

02:01:55
JULIE TILSEN - is making some difference you feel like you're really standing end up on ground? 

02:02:00
SUSAN It, yeah, it doesn't feel like its fixed, like its totally resolved but I feel like just being able to have s-- something that we can focus on and both agree on that, that's help a lot, I feel like. 

02:02:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. Okay, so this been in lines of with what you are experiencing at home as, as when we look kind of it, the numbers - 

02:02:20
SUSAN Yes. 

02:02:20
JULIE TILSEN - that you kind of organizing around. That's make sense, okay. And, and Frankie you-- you're saying things or feeling, all these is colors. If you think or feeling, feeling better home too? 

02:02:30
FRANKIE Oh, yeah. 

02:02:30
Explore individual scales on SRS 

02:02:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. So, here we got, and what I, what I notice right away is, is last time when we scored, when we work individually I remember that you have the second line a lot lower about family and this one has come up a bit I just can see that, uhm. 

02:02:50
SUSAN That's good. 

02:02:50
Continue discussion of meaning of scores/connecting scores to lived experience 

02:02:50
JULIE TILSEN Okay, that, well what I wondering Frankie does that make sense, is it feel like there's, there's a change at home? 

02:02:55
FRANKIE Kind of, ah, I like the number thing that we're doing cuz it like, if I say you're being a three then she ups to like a five. 

02:03:05
JULIE TILSEN Well just magically what does mom do to up it? 

02:03:10
FRANKIE Ah, she has, she talks different and she kinda, uhm, we talk a little bit while I said what the number I said and, ah, it gets, ah, it gets a little bit better, uhm, like that. 

02:03:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Are you guys saying that the numbers are sort of getting you a way to, uhm, have a conversation in maybe unless... 

02:03:30
FRANKIE Recognize what each others talking about. 

02:03:35
JULIE TILSEN Aah! 

02:03:35
SUSAN Yeah. 

02:03:35
JULIE TILSEN This is the language we share before, were you talking up the languages? 

02:03:40
SUSAN It almost thought that way because I really was feeling like there's a big change in, in Frankie and she is just not seeing it at all. And so it seems like we're talking in circles because she just doesn't see what I see and I don't see what she is, is feeling and, and this way we kind of, you know, literally put a number on, on what we are seeing and describing and then help each other understand where the other person is coming from. 

02:04:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, so, uhm, so, you know, be-- before we do it we say we gonna do is, is split up, you know, as I remember from our first meeting we talked about this idea of seeing eye to eye, we talked about the idea of closing the gap. 

02:04:25
SUSAN Uh-hmm. 

02:04:25
JULIE TILSEN And doing the numbers closer and, uhm, i-- i-- it seems like while there is still a quite a distance between them, you know, Susan your mark from last week went up seven, from seven point three to 12 whereas Frankie, yours went up just a little bit 25 point, aye, upside down, my bad reading, 25.7, as 27.2. So, you're moving up and you say and it feels better at home but you're not moving up at session rapid rate that, I mean, she still kind of getting some gains on you here. You guys are getting closer together. 

02:04:55
SUSAN Okay. 

02:04:55
FRANKIE Uh-hmm. 

02:04:55
JULIE TILSEN And, and I'm wondering at home what experience have you had a feeling closer together that would support what this is saying. So its not just about the numbers, wha-- what sort of things Susan? 

02:05:10
SUSAN Well I don't know that there has been a specific incident but it just being able to talk about, ah, a little bit more. 

02:05:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:15
SUSAN And taking that time to talk about it, uhm, rather than just getting frustrated. 

02:05:25
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:25
SUSAN Uhm, ah, is really, its just helping, helping me feel better about the situation. 

02:05:30
JULIE TILSEN All right so, Susan well take maybe 20, 25 minutes alone together and then, uhm, I'll spend a little time with Frankie like we talked about. 

02:05:40
SUSAN Okay. 

02:05:40
JULIE TILSEN So I know you just scored this when we sat down together. 

02:05:40
SUSAN Yes. 

02:05:45
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, but what I'd like you to do is re-think and score it again, maybe it will be the same, I don't know but last week and just not today I'd asked you to score it thinking about, uhm, how you see Frankie doing? 

02:06:00
SUSAN Right. 

02:06:00
JULIE TILSEN And since we gonna take a little bit of time today focusing parenting, you know, so many things we said we would do is we - 

02:06:05
SUSAN Right. 

02:06:05
JULIE TILSEN - ah, split up the time can you score to-- in terms of how the concerns at home as a parent are affecting you? 

02:06:15
SUSAN Oh, okay. 

02:06:15
JULIE TILSEN Does that make sense? 

02:06:15
SUSAN Yeah. 

02:06:15
JULIE TILSEN So just, just mark it a different if its the same as what your marked before just maybe just put a circle around it. 

02:06:20
SUSAN Okay. So this is how I feel like I'm doing? 

02:06:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, things, given, considering the problems that have brought you here, let alone how Frankie is doing how it impacts parenting. 

02:06:35
SUSAN Okay. 

02:06:35
JULIE TILSEN But, you know, perhaps, you know, as a parent it extend to other parts of your life. So actually you're at work or maybe that's arrested for you. 

02:06:40
SUSAN Uhm, uhm, sure. 

02:06:40
JULIE TILSEN Maybe you're like free from it, will you take off and go to the office? 

02:06:45
SUSAN Right. 

02:06:45
JULIE TILSEN So does that make sense? 

02:06:45
SUSAN Yes, absolutely. 

02:06:45
Alliance-reflecting impact of problem back to client 

02:06:50
JULIE TILSEN So, so, so there, ah, there is a difference. You-- your concerns for Frankie, ah, greater than, uhm, how you feel like you're doing overall as a parent. 

02:07:00
SUSAN Right. 

02:07:00
JULIE TILSEN Yet, just looking real quickly, I mean, this would be a part of ten, you know, it looks like as a parent, uhm, it is taking it's to all in - 

02:07:10
SUSAN Yeah. 

02:07:10
JULIE TILSEN - in, in all areas of your life to some extent. 

02:07:10
SUSAN Its on my mind all the time. 

02:07:15
JULIE TILSEN On your mind all the time. 

02:07:15
SUSAN And, and so I feel like even at work or out with friends. 

02:07:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm, uh-hmm. 

02:07:20
SUSAN You know, its what I'm talking about it, it's what I'm worrying about all the time and I feel like if we could get this one thing figure it out I could really thrive in other areas again. 

02:07:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so that like this is are defining who you are in all dimensions. 

02:07:35
SUSAN Yeah, that's my kid, you know, I think about it all the time. 

02:07:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. What does that say about you ask, what kind of mom you are, that it does affect all - 

02:07:45
SUSAN Well, probably that I'm a worrier. 

02:07:45
JULIE TILSEN - I mean... 

02:07:45
SUSAN But, uhm, you know, I hope that I'm a good mom, I hope I'm not over thinking at it but, uhm... 

02:07:55
JULIE TILSEN What would it look like if you are under thinking it? 

02:07:55
SUSAN Well, right. 

02:08:00
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

02:08:00
SUSAN That'll probably be worse, so... 

02:08:05
JULIE TILSEN All right Frankie, well thanks for hanging out, hmm, and waiting while your mom and I talk a bit. Uhm, it's okay if I use your purple pen? 

02:08:10
FRANKIE Yeah. 

02:08:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, all right. You don't want take this when you go? 

02:08:15
FRANKIE No, no. 

02:08:15
Clarifying goals and purposes 

02:08:15
JULIE TILSEN Okay, all right. So I know that what we talked about we'll spend a little bit time, you and me talking and it's just like your mom and I talking, that you're in it. Bring it back together and, it kinda came-- tell me if I'm remembering this right or wrong you-- or it change for you since we talked a week ago. You kinda said that maybe we wanna talking about some of the stuff that you'd like to talk about. Am I getting that right? 

02:08:40
FRANKIE Ah, yeah. 

02:08:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah? 

02:08:45
FRANKIE Ah, mostly because she was there and she was thinking of what she want to talk about. 

02:08:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. You can feel like you had a head start on you, being able to think about what you are and talk about. 

02:08:55
FRANKIE Yeah. 

02:08:55
Alliance-clarifying client preferences 

02:08:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Okay. So, when we shut down have (inaudible ) when you guys has got here you said things are going better, and, and at least, uhm, get the numbers kinda talk with each other about and stuff. So, given that it's going a bit better and given that, uhm, now you've had a chance maybe to catch up and think about how you'd like to use some of the time. Do you have some ideas, or what you like to talk about and what you feel like I need to get about you in order to - 

02:09:20
FRANKIE Ah. 

02:09:20
JULIE TILSEN - be able to be helpful. 

02:09:20
FRANKIE Well, on my opinion I think sometimes my mom is a dork. 

02:09:25
JULIE TILSEN Dork? 

02:09:25
FRANKIE And that she... 

02:09:25
JULIE TILSEN That was at a downgrade from crazy, cause you call me crazy. Is she not as bad up being a dork? 

02:09:30
FRANKIE I think so. 

02:09:35
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

02:09:35
FRANKIE Ah, she, she really thinks that the whole problem is that she doesn't understand or, she doesn't, she is no with happening all the time and - 

02:09:45
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

02:09:45
FRANKIE - I think that, I guess that's important but she is worrying about too much and I don't think she really needs to be worried that much and I feel like if she wasn't worrying so much then the numbers will be closer together. 

02:09:55
JULIE TILSEN Okay. So, tell me if I'm getting this right. It's a downgrade of severity from crazy to dork? 

02:10:05
FRANKIE Yeah. 

02:10:05
JULIE TILSEN You know what I mean by that? It's not a serious as situation like if crazy is red alert. 

02:10:10
FRANKIE Yeah, cuz she is. 

02:10:10
JULIE TILSEN Dork is more like yellow alert. 

02:10:15
FRANKIE Yeah, cuz she is - 

02:10:15
JULIE TILSEN All right. 

02:10:15
FRANKIE - I guess she's not crazy because like I knew everybody has something that they had to, to think about and worry about so that's, this is her thing its just that she isn't... 

02:10:25
JULIE TILSEN You are her thing, right? 

02:10:25
FRANKIE Yeah. That's, that's about. 

02:10:25
JULIE TILSEN The thing, the thing. Okay. 

02:10:25
FRANKIE Yeah. 

02:10:30
JULIE TILSEN It's so but its all the worry around it. 

02:10:30
FRANKIE Yeah. 

02:10:30
Integrating scores into care 

02:10:30
JULIE TILSEN And you said something about the numbers so tell me what you're thinking, you'll seeing the numbers like if, if we took this out again. If you were to look at the, the ORS in this scales into personal, ah, individually, socially overall where do you think you might see a change, uhm, things getting better if there was less from worrying about you. Where do you think that might show up? 

02:11:00
FRANKIE Uhm, I would say interpersonality-- interpersonally. 

02:11:05
JULIE TILSEN I-- interpersonally, okay. And, uhm, what kinds of things could your mom do a little bit differently that might, uhm, demonstrate to you, prove to you, indicate to you, that there is a little less worry so that interpersonal scale would come up just a bit. What would you be saying or doing, or responding to you differently? 

02:11:30
FRANKIE I think of it last week, she's being effort to talk to me more and not instead of just saying like there's a problem and kinda just thinking out and yelling - 

02:11:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

02:11:40
FRANKIE - whatever we talking she is more like, she's kinda normal conversations and sometimes it seems kinda fake like she is just trying to be like, oh, hi, I'm trying to fix this so let's have a real conversation but its not really real. 

02:11:50
JULIE TILSEN Its not really real? 

02:11:50
FRANKIE But I think even if its not totally natural, it working. 

02:11:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

02:11:55
FRANKIE And if it starts working then it could get natural and then - 

02:12:00
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

02:12:00
FRANKIE - then it could be working naturally. 

02:12:05
JULIE TILSEN And then the numbers keep going up. 

02:12:05
FRANKIE Yeah. 

02:12:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay, good.
