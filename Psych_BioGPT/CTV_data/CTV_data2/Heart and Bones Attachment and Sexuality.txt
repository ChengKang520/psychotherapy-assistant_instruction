RICH Welcome, everyone, to this Networker webcast series: Attachment Theory in Action. We're exploring the practical implications of a model of human development that's had increasing influence in our field and we've looked at it from a number of perspectives over these weeks. And today we're gonna be looking at couple's relationships and particularly the issue of the connection between sexuality and a couple's sex life and attachment and their degree of emotional attachment in that relationship. And who better to discuss this topic with than one of our leading couple's therapist the uh, originator of emotionally focused couple's therapy Sue Johnson. Sue, how are you? 

00:01:00
SUE Hey, Rich. How you doing? 

00:01:00
RICH So, Sue, we were- talk of this field of psychotherapy was really founded by- a 100 years ago and more by uh, a gentleman in Vienna who taught us that the prime motivator in human relationships is, from uh, very early age, is the human sex drive. 

00:01:25
SUE Hmm-mm. 

00:01:25
RICH Is that- have we in the 100 years since Freud launched this profession have we changed our notions about human motivation? 

00:01:35
SUE Ah, well, I think so. I mean in a way it becomes strange if after 100 years we hadn't learned something, yeah? 

00:01:40
RICH Okay. 

00:01:40
SUE But I think on the topic we're gonna talk about here, I think what's important is that what John Bowlby basically said is that there's three basic um, relational, behavioral systems, if you want to think of it that way. And you could think of it maybe a little bit in terms of motives but he talked about it as behavioral systems. There's attachment, sexuality, and caregiving, if you think he was looking at relationships. But what he said was that attachment is the- the scaffolding for the other two. So, how you attach? How you deal with your emotions and engage emotionally with the people that are important to you? How you attach with your partner? Is gonna imp- is gonna shape your sexuality and your caregiving. So, how you attach? How you regulate your emotions? How you engage is gonna be how you make love. Is gonna be how you react in the sexual context. And this need for contact and safe connection is actually the most important motivator we have; more important than sex. So, I think Freud would've been pretty horrified! 

00:02:55
RICH Okay. 

00:02:55
SUE Maybe not, but I think so. 

00:03:00
RICH We put the Freudians out there in the audience on alert that they may hear- 

00:03:05
SUE They may be horrified! Yes, they may be horrified. Okay. 

00:03:05
RICH So, what we'll be doing in this conversation is we wanna give folks uh, a flavor of how you work with couples particularly when they're dealing with some kinda of sexual issues and how you put that in context of couple's therapy. But to begin with uh, you have some notions about different kinds of sexual connections. Three basic different kinds of sexual connections that in your experience, in your practice you've see over the years. So, why don't we begin with that? What is it that your- when people are coming into your office, in your experience of couples, how would you describe what these three central categories are? 

00:03:45
SUE Well, I think we start from a place that we assume that if you're going to dance together emotionally in a relationship or physically in a sexual interaction if you think about how much coordination actually goes on in a sexual interaction it's a very intricate dance, actually. You have to read somebody's cues, you have to tune into somebody, you have to move with somebody, you have to follow and lead. Think about that. It's actually quite- 

00:04:15
RICH It's like a Tango isn't it, Sue. 

00:04:15
SUE It is like a Tango. 

00:04:20
RICH A subject near and dear to your heart. We know from previous interviewers- interviews in the series. 

00:04:25
SUE Yes, so, if you think about that what we assume is that you're going to do it best. You're going to do it with your partner. Tune in best. Um, be able to let go and move into this dance best. If you have a certain openness and responsiveness and emotional safety with each other. So, for example, we'll go for- even if you come in and you say: "The main problem is sexual," we won't start there. We'll start with what I am talking about which is: Do you have this safe, open, responsive connection? If you do, the logic of what I just said is you're gonna be better lovers. And we call that synchronous sex. And it's interesting because when couples have these incredible conversations in the second stage of EFT, that we know and we've just shown in our research project, build more secure bonds, they talk at the end of therapy how their sex life has changed because they are open to each other, they tune in, they're more responsive, they can be- they can talk to each other about what they need, they can talk to each other about what they fear. And the research says that um, really, securely attached people have the best sex, they enjoy sex more, they have sex more often. So, we call that synchronous sex. And it's- if you'd like- if you're gonna work with- if you're gonna work with sexuality, I think just like everything else, you have to have an image of what you're moving towards. You have to have an image of what is healthy sexuality. And I think, unless you understand love and what a healthy relationship is, unless you can put sex in context, that's pretty difficult to come up with. 

00:06:20
RICH So, that this doesn't get too- just idolized and idealized- so when- what is- what is that couples who are experiencing uh, synchrony sex, what are they things they say? What do you hear in the- maybe this doesn't happen when they come in the door, but presumably, they're closer to it when they- at the end of things. What are the kinds of things that people can listen for that couples say? The difference between the kinda- and maybe you wanna talk first a bit about the- the two of the- the- the more problematic sexual relationship and then we'll move towards uh, synchrony. So, when it's the early stages when couples are outta sync, what are the kinds of ways they describe their sex life? And maybe even give us a little bit of the language that you often hear. 

00:07:10
SUE Yeah, well, when people come in, usually they come in some- in a distressed relationship, right? They come in- whether the relationship got distressed through a sexual problem, you know, no matter what role the sexual problem play, whether it was a big role or a small player- uh, role, right? When a couple come to see you and things aren't going well and they're distressed in their relationships. Often what you've got is one person criticizing, complaining, feeling alone and abandoned. And another person shutting down. But the shutdown person might, might come on to the other person for sex but it doesn't work cuz they're outta sync with each other, right? They're just- they can't tune into each other. So, what you hear people say is: "Well, I don't feel safe and I don't want to depend on this person and I'm protecting myself because you know, she's always criticizing me and I'm protecting myself. So, I do come onto her, you know, because I like sex and that's almost the only time when I feel close to her. I do but, you know, uh, really, it's kind of- really, I just focus on uh- it seems like we just go for orgasm." And you hear these people talk about that sex is about orgasm and it's about performance and sensation, right? And they focus on that. They focus- and often the other partner will say, I had one lady say: "I'm just a blowup doll for you. I don't feel any emotional connection. You come onto me and somehow I think it helps you feel better in the relationship, it's not just an orgasm, I know it helps you feel better. But you come onto me, there's no emotional connection between us. We don't talk, we don't communicate, we hardly hug each other, you don't look me in the face, right? There's no real sense of emotional safety between us. You come onto me and I feel like a blowup doll and if feel, actually, even lonelier." And you basically, say: "Well, you know, that- you say well, it seemed to work well to me and didn't you like it?" The more avoidant person tends to focus on performance and sensation. 

00:09:30
RICH And that's what you call sealed off sexuality. 

00:09:35
SUE Sealed off sex. 

00:09:35
RICH That's the term. And that's- these are- there's this character, right? Folks who have a- a avoidance attachment style. This is the kind of- 

00:09:40
SUE Yeah. 

00:09:40
RICH Connection they- they tend to establish through default. 

00:09:45
SUE Yes, and we know that avoiding the attached folks are much more likely to have one-night-stands. We also know that, actually, they don't enjoy sex as much as securely attached folks. So, my assuming- my assumption here is that James Bond was, actually, not having a terribly good time in all those movies, okay? Even, though, the lady he was making out with is amazingly beautiful, he's not emotionally engaged. Actually, he is emotionally engaged. He is emotionally engaged in how hot he is. "My God, I'm hot, right? I'm James Bond, right?" So, if you're into your own performance and into novel sensation, you often want novelty. So, you'll see a man in your office who isn't comfortable with closeness, doesn't want to talk about his feeling with his wife but he's- what he wants in the relationship is he wants her to do all kinds of sexual positions, right? And she can't even listen to it cuz she doesn't even feel emotionally safe with him. The other thing we forget about sex is, it's not just an enormous circus act of coordination emotionally and physically, you know, I mean, it also brings all kinds of incredible emotions with it. Like it's- how we're vulnerable. We make love face to face, naked, right? Our most- 

00:11:15
RICH Most of the time. 

00:11:15
SUE Most of the time, alright, most of the time. 

00:11:20
RICH I think. 

00:11:20
SUE And the most vulnerable parts of our body are- are open, right? And this is- there's some new research that says that for women in particular, this may be why emotional safety really matters to women. Because they literally- they feel vulnerable in sexuality. I think somebody put women in a FMRI machine. I can't remember who did this. And they put women and men in FMRI machine and they said they were doing some little tasks and they snuck in- they snuck in um, subconscious pictures of naked members of the opposite sex. And they had a way of um, making sure these people actually registered that and got slightly aroused, right? What was really interesting is, the guys registered it they- their brains got aroused and it was just like the sort of arousal part of their brains. Every time the women got aroused, their prefrontal cortex would turn on as well, even it was subliminal and very subtle. And that what the researchers said is, it seems like the control executive part of the brain always automatically turns on in arousal and desire with women, why would that be true? And one thing is because that women are more vulnerable in sex literally, physically they're more vulnerable, right? I mean, in the caveman times you could imagine, you know, you'd get bonked on the head and taken off into the cave and hey, you know? But, I think that's true. So, these people would talk about that maybe this is why women tend to be the gatekeepers in sex and they say: "I wanna have emotional safety with you and try to- I know that I can connect with you emotionally before I open up my body and before, basic- definitely before I can relax and submit and, you know, let go and just let myself be carried away by these feelings- 

00:13:25
RICH It's not so easy for women to experience this kind of what the- detachment that men can often, sometimes often experience. 

00:13:30
SUE Yes. 

00:13:30
RICH Now before- I wanna move into a bit more to talk about what you do but then talk to us about what you uh, describe as solace sex. And how does that contrast with what we've just been talking about? 

00:13:45
SUE Well, avoidant- if you're into avoiding attachment, shutting down, containing all your emotions you tend to have detached, shutdown sex. If you're anxious all the time, anxiously attached people tend to have solace sex, which is really about proving they're love or feeling comforted. So, classic example, um, man comes in- Danny comes into my office and he says: "The trouble with this relationship is that I am a high- I have high testosterone, right? I'm highly sexed. I am an intense highly sexed man and I want my wife to make love to me four times a week." And he, in front of me, he pressures her to this. His wife has totally shut him out, okay? But she does make, believe it or not, she does make love to him- but when- she actually says to him things like: "Didn't we go away and didn't we make love a lot and didn't we, didn't we um, have a beautiful evening the other evening." And he says: "Yes, but I wanna know that it's gonna happen next week and the week after. And how do I know that you're not just gonna get depressed again and shut me out." Can you feel the pressure? And it seemed to me like she kept trying to turn to him and actually she did find him physically attractive. And there were times when they could manage to meet on that level. But basically he kept pushing her and pushing her. And then in therapy what comes out is, it's not about his big sex drive. It's about the fact that deep, deep down, and that's pretty hard for him to talk about, he's' he's never believed that she really desired or wanted him. He sees her as totally beautiful, which she was, and he's always sees himself as actually as this little guy who's trying to prove himself. And he married her when she was on the rebound. And he's tortured everyday by these thoughts that she just married him on the rebound, she's never really loved him, she doesn't really want him. And when he's feeling really insecure he starts to decide that actually she's had all kinds of affairs on him. Which, as far as I could see, she never had. It really wasn't her style at all, okay? So, he would- but what's happening is, he's highly anxious and the way he deals with that anxiety is to say: "Respond to me sexually, make love to me, and by the way, you must have an orgasm. And then I know I am loved." The trouble is, she's in the position of always having to prove to him that he's loved and this becomes like a weight, like a weight around her. And she starts to shut him out physically and emotionally. And that's solace sex. I've heard women say: "Uh, well, the sex is nice but, you know, I want the cuddling. I want the holding and the cuddling at the end." You know, um, I mean, we know that you're flooded with oxytocin, a bonding hormone in sex, nature designed sex and bonding to go together, but it's almost like those women aren't waiting for the orgasm, they're waiting for the oxytocin to kick in- 

00:17:20
RICH The afterglow. 

00:17:20
SUE Yeah, to have this feeling of ah, you know, I'm safe, I'm content, I'm connected, right? That wonderful kind of feeling. And let's not put it down. I mean, I think we've gone a bit crazy about orgasm, you know, let's not put it down, I'm Canadian after all, okay, yeah. 

00:17:40
RICH Nothing wrong with a good orgasm. 

00:17:40
SUE Hey, we have enough Robertson Davies, the Canadian author, said years ago: "The whole world has gone crazy about orgasm," and this is a very Canadian statement. What we have to understand, actually, is that orgasm is just a muscle spasm, okay? So, I think these anxious women who take sex as proof they're loved and that they're pleasing their husband are waiting for that oxytocin rush. They're waiting for the feeling of bonding. See, the point about this really is, we can all have these different kinds of sex sometimes. Sometimes we can have pretty detached sex, sometimes we can have sex that's really make up sex after a fight, right? It's all about: "Do you love me?" "Yes, I love you." "Do you love me?" And as long as I think we can also find a way to bond and feel safe and have the safe adventure that's called synchronous sex where you can play and be erotic and emotionally connected. That's healthy sex for me. And uh, at the end of EFT when we've helped people connect safely on an emotional level and share their fears and needs and learn to respond to each other, that's the kind of sex that I want my couples to tell me that they're having. 

00:19:00
RICH Okay. So, let's, let's see this then uh, we've- let's focus a bit more on the, really the foundation of your- you're dealing with all the issues that arise in relationship and with couples, sex amongst them. But let's talk a little bit about what- really is what the primary to you. And what is distinctive about EFT in addressing this- the human attachment and the problems, the attachment ruptures that can happen in human relationship? What- what is it you feel like it would- it would seem at one level the most general level, all couple's therapy and isn't all of psychotherapy in some ways about addressing the issues of human attachment and the ups and downs of human attachment. What both- what's distinctive and, and um, about EFT in its approach? 

00:20:00
SUE Well, I think it's important to think about that we haven't understood human bonding and we haven't understood adult love until very recently and attachment has helped us do that. So, from my point of view um, couple's therapists have known on some general level that it's important to help people get closer, okay? But that's pretty general, that's pretty vague, right? Um, I think um, once you start- 

00:20:30
RICH Connection, intimacy, all the- that- 

00:20:30
SUE Yeah. 

00:20:35
RICH Language that if you're a guy, at least, you- you've heard a lot of that and uh, it's just sort of a uh, a fog that you float through and perhaps you get dragged into couple's therapy. The idea that you're gonna be pursuing and experiencing something that you really don't have any clear idea what are you talking about? What do you want from me? 

00:20:55
SUE Yes. And so, from an EFT point of view, um, we spend a lot of time in the field going around the edges looking at symptoms and also trying to create closeness in different ways when we didn't really have a road map. We've tried to help people be nicer in conflict. We've tried to help people, you know, talk and negotiate about sex. And from my point of view, we've gone around the edges of the problem uh, without targeting the key issue which is that couples, you can have all kinds of differences, you know, they can be different, that's not the issue, the point is, couples come to see you because they're locked in negative dances where they scare the hell out of each other and they can't find any way to have a safe emotional bond. So, what we do in EFT is not just contain conflict or help people feel happier in the relationship, more satisfied, we are deliberately trying to create this emotional bond because, if you have that, if you create that it's so rewarding for people, the change will last. And also good emotional bonds build resilient um, happy, not depressed, not anxious people, right? So, we try to create this emotional bond and what that is, is very specific kind of accessibility and responsiveness. So, if you come into EFT we will immediately listen with an attachment ear. Sol, when somebody says um, "the issue in this relationship is he's always late." I'll go-, I won't-, I'll listen to that and I'll say: "As you say that you look incredibly angry." And she goes: "I am incredibly angry!" And then she'll bring up eight times that he was late. And he'll try to persuade her that he really wasn't so bad, right. And she'll get angrier and angrier. And at the end of the whole thing, we start talking about what's happening for her when she talks about him being late and she says: "He doesn't care. He doesn't care about my feelings. He doesn't care that I'm standing there waiting for him. He leaves me waiting. He never comes. He leaves me waiting. I'm there alone." She's not talking about his problem with time. She's talking about a feeling of aloneness and abandonment in the relationship. She's talking about this dreadful feeling that he's not there for her. And when we go to that level, she starts to bring up some real injuries in the relationship where she was desperate for his comfort and caring. She didn't know how to ask and he didn't give it. And even though, we could say: "Well, that's not reasonable. You know, she should've asked." She didn't know how to ask, she kinda put hints out, he didn't respond and she felt totally alone. She got angrier and angrier and started picking out all sorts of complaints like: "you're late," like you're-," and as she gets angrier and pushes, he moves away further, right. By the way, that couple weren't making love at all. They weren't making it at all, right. And she says, you know, "I'm so angry at you!" And you know it's right if you're angry and scared I'm sorry sexuality really goes on the back burner. It just doesn't go together. Anxiety and rage do not fit with relaxed, coordinated, erotic, fun, and sexuality. They just don't go, right? So, uh, we would focus on negative patterns that cut people off emotionally from each other and emotions in your body. You know, phys-, emotions effect when you can tune into somebody else, they effect whether you're open to respond to somebody else. This is-, this is still all about sex, right? So, we'll look at patterns. We'll ask people how do you emotionally connect? How do you lose each other? What patterns do you have in your relationship. Often it's "I push him to talk to me. I feel lonely." He says: "She attacks me. I feel awful." I saw a couple this morning he said: "I can never do it right. I feel hopeless and helpless. So, I shutdown. And then suddenly, I can't shutdown anymore so, I explode!" And they have separate bedrooms. So, you know, when this lack of emotional connection happens the sex goes. So, we start there. We start with this negative pattern that keeps scaring the hell out of you. And in the session this morning, the couple stopped talking about the content issues of what's happening. And they start talking about how lonely they both feel and how they see each other, right, how they don't have this connection. Then, if they stay with me in therapy, I'm gonna-, once they can look at how they scare each other, look at how they get stuck in these patterns of distance, I'm going to help them have what we call Hold-Me-Tight conversation. Where they are able to talk about their attachment needs and fears in a way that helps the person move close and open up to them, right. I'm gonna be able to do that. And as they open up emotionally, they become accessible and responsive, they start to open up physically to each other too; their sex is going to start to improve. 

00:26:35
RICH So let-, lemme- 

00:26:35
SUE (inaudible ) 

00:26:37
RICH Give feedback to you. My understanding of this then maybe you can clarify for the audience how as therapist you work with this. So, what-, what I understand about what's distinctive of your way of working is your-, this attention you're giving to the subtext of what the drama, the intensity you're giving-, 

00:27:00
SUE Emotion, the emotion signals. 

00:27:00
RICH Yeah, so there's intensity that often is bewildering to couple's therapists about arguments that don't seem of, on the face of it, such consequence. And what you have supplied in your work it seems to me is, here's the subtext, here's the drama. Here's what's at stake with the argument about the waiting or the dishes or the watching television or the computer. Why these seem like life and death struggles- 

00:27:25
SUE Yeah. 

00:27:25
RICH But beyond that it seems like what you, what you're calling this Hold-Me-Tight conversation is that you have very-, these very specific methods of creating a sense of repair and reconnection that involves people's ability to express, go beyond their secondary defensive emotions and with the help of uh, a therapists being able to lay bare these very-, this, this uh, this need for attachment, this longing, this sense of emotional vulnerability. That repair is- 

00:28:05
SUE Yeah. 

00:28:05
RICH And if that's so, tell us a little bit about as a practical manner if that's-, if I've gotten that, what is it that you do-, at what point you begin to move towards this-, once you've understood the situation the issues at stake for the couple, what's distinctive about how an EFT therapist is helping couples to repair these ruptures in their relationship. 

00:28:35
SUE What's distinctive is that we help them have very powerful emotional conversations where they are able to reach for each other. Where the answer to the question: Are you there for me? Is yes. In the present moment in the session. 

00:28:50
RICH Right there. 

00:28:50
SUE Right. That I am-, so, I-, the therapist helps me go into my emotions, hold on to them, keep my emotional balance and turn and say to you, right, "I feel so small, I feel like I'm never gonna please you. I'm never going to do it enough. So, I do shutdown, I do, I do. And the only thing I know to do to get close is to ask you for sex. And then when you won't make love to me, I feel even more helpless and hopeless and I shutdown more." This man he says-, as he says his fear "And I'm scared I've already lost you. And it's killing me. I can't bear it." So, this is a withdrawn man who would never speak and we help him find a language for his feelings. And then he says what he needs. "What I need is to know-, I need for you to hang in with me and help me learn how to come close. I don't know how to do it. I need you to give me a chance. I need you to stop telling me that all I want is an orgasm. I need for you to hear me and not keep criticizing me and telling me I'm doing it wrong. I need some space here. and I do want to dance with you. I wanna come. That's what we call withdrawer re-engagement, right? That man is coming out and he's reaching for his partner. Then we help her respond, so, it's very specific, you know, it's a very- it's creating- 

00:30:25
RICH Well, let's stay with- let's stay with that specificity. So, this, and there's quite a bit of this is not the lingua franca of most- of most men I know, including myself, so you've- there's quite a bit that goes into being able to have someone put so much of their experience and their secret experience. Things that the last thing in the world they would want someone else to know, other men, and including his partner to be able to put into language all the things that you just said and that's a very powerful communication. So, maybe we can help people in a two part thing. First, of all, give us the flavor, what is your role as the therapists in helping the guy to be able to be that forthcoming? To be able to put into language things that probably he doesn't even know that he's feeling or at least at the level of language. And then you can help us also understand just because he says that doesn't automatically everything is hunky-dory. Then you have your work cut out with you with- through the partner. But let's start with the man first. So you've just given us the flavor of a moment that's very powerful in EFT. What have you done as a therapist to make such a moment possible? And the more specific you can be the better. 

00:31:40
SUE Well, first of all what you do is you create an amazing amount of safety. Like, I just did a live session this morning and an EFT externship right here in Ottawa, and I met a couple I've never met before. And they're in really bad, bad shape. She's clinically depressed, very shutdown, she was a trauma survivor as a child. He's frantic in rage, upset, okay? And he starts talking about that in the moment before he gets enraged he has this feeling and he says: "I don't know how to put it into words." Now, the thing is I've worked with a lot of people in attachment distress, in what John Bowlby would call separation distress, okay? And they get desperate. So, I say: "Could you help me? Right now, if I look at your face, it's almost like-, it feels like you're just staring over a cliff." So, I'll give him an image. He says: "Oh, I'm not staring over the cliff. I'm in freefall." I say: "You're in freefall?" And his eyes fill with tears and then I'll support him and I'll validate him and I'll reflect his reality so I can order it for him so he can tolerate it. And he says: "Yes, maybe there's something wrong with me." I say: "Oh, no, no-no, when we're scared we're gonna lose the person we love an depend on, we're all in freefall. That's scary." And he says: "Yes, that's scary." Yeah, so, it's very collaborative. We sort of discovery his experience together. And what attachment says, and as we all (inaudible ) you know, we all need this connection and we all get threatened. And there's only so many ways we can deal with it emotionally. So, there's kind of a roadmap here so, I'm tuning in to him pretty easily and I just help him listen to his own experience. And he says: "I get enraged because I can't lose her and I feel so helpless and I sit on it and sit on it and then, you know, she turns away from me and I lose it." And I say: "And in that moment, if you didn't get angry what would you say?" Now, all I'm doing is directing his attention. He says: "I'd say don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me." And as he says that his wife, who's been staring at the carpet the whole time, okay, looks up at him cuz he never says that. He says: "Why don't you talk to me?" Right. "Why won't you make love to me?" Right, and suddenly the whole emotional music has changed and there's this whole other dance. She looks up at him and it was very moving, actually, because um, he's a pretty tough guy and he talked a lot about being mad but he had a tear on his face and his had been talking about moving out. And certainly not wanting to have sex with him, not wanting to be with him and as she looks at him she reached over and she uh, put-, took the, you know, put her hand on his face where the tear was, right. And then she-, and then she come- leaped back in her chair. And I just said: "What just happened right there?" So, EFT therapist will go into these powerful attachment moments. And in a way, we deal with sexuality the same. We'll get the couple when they have some emotional safety in the second stage of EFT to talk about, attack sex problems. We'll do the same thing. We'll go into these powerful moments and we'll sort of unpack the-, what the meaning attachment was, and we'll unpack the fears and needs in the bedroom. And we'll help people have these new conversations where they can come and help each other create emotional balance. And she says when I said what happened to you when you reached over? She said: "Well, I do love him." This one we talked about leaving, okay. I said: "Ah, right now, you can feel your love for him?" She says: "I love him when I see this." Ah, right. Cuz, right now, he's not dangerous, he's not scary, he's your precious Ron. You love him when you see this. She says: "Yes, I love him and I don't want him to hurt." And then I said: "But then you jumped back." She said: "Yes. Then this other voice reminds me that when he yells at me how incre-" and she's a trauma survivor, okay. "This other voice reminds me when he yells at me, that's scary and it opens the door to my darkness." Now, people go into that emotional level because I'm not scared of that emotional level. I-, we teach people in EFT to work with powerful emotion and to use it to shape new experience and new signals. And this changes how they dance together. It changes how they dance together in regular situation and in conversation. It changes how they dance together in bed. Right? It's you know, but that's what I'm trying to do there is help that couple open up to each other and respond to each other differently. In that moment she did respond differently. She reached over, he responded, he showed his vulnerability, not his rage. He dealt with his helplessness in a totally different way with my help, you know. I'm creating safety there. And she responded differently by reaching over and touching his face where his tear was running down his face, right. So, and then I say to them: "Hey, guys, five minutes ago, you know, you were talking about this relationship is impossible. What just happened here?" Basically, I tell them they're brilliant. And they've just stepped out of the negative dance and they put new music on. And for a moment there, they were open and responsive to each other and I could feel their love for each other. So, we know how to that on a pretty systematic level. 

00:38:10
RICH You could create those moments so the connection then is getting from those moments that are poetic, that are spiritual you know to be in the presence of people finding themselves in that way is-, as we know is a very-, it's a powerful experience for the therapist as well as for the couple. What's the step then in terms of beyond those moments? Do those moments-, is your idea that they-, if they have them enough times they automatically translate outside of your consulting room into a change in the pattern of the relationship? Or is there-, is there some more explicit heavy lifting that couples need to do? What-, is there another-, what's the other, if there is, what is the other piece to the kinda work you do when you're really helping couples try to transform relationships that really are at the edge like what with the one you're describing. 

00:39:10
SUE Well, on one level, you better believe that if they have enough of those moments, and that couple need to know how to get there more reliably, okay? And they need-, they've adjusted the end of stage one of EFT, they need to go in and do that much more. And to know that they can do it, okay? To know how to move into that easily without so much help from us. But on one level, if they can do that, if they can turn when they're scared, instead of turning away or against each other, of they can turn towards each other and reach like that, you better believe that's powerful enough. That's powerful stuff and they'll keep doing it and the research on EFT says that our results are stable across time. And we're-, I think we're, actually, almost the only couple's therapy that's shown that, that the results are stable across time, okay? So, then you've got to have something that really is powerful to create that. On the other hand, we help them create a new story of what they've done and how they've repaired their relationship. We help them turn it into their everyday life. And if we need to, you know, sometimes if you change the negative cycle of demanding and criticizing and withdrawing, the sex just comes along and improves because the couple are more open to each other, they're more responsive, they're more affectionate, they trust each other and sex becomes a safe adventure again, right? Other times that's not true. Other times sex is specifically difficult. It's got its own music and especially vulnerable for people and you have to go in and help them with that. So, you know, you go in and once they've got this basic-, starting to get this basic emotional safety he'll say, well, you know, he'll say something like: "Well, we're closer, I feel better in the relationship, you know, we don't get caught in that horrible negative cycle or spiral, we can get out of it. I feel connected but I still think our sex isn't very good. So, the EFT therapist will say: "Okay, let's talk about that." Right? And I think you and I were talking we were having fun before we started here where there are specific sexual problems. Sexual problems just like every other problem, if you deal with it together it's much more powerful that if, you know, it somehow gets caught up and loaded with attachment significance and get's all-, signals get distorted then. So, this man had withdrawn from his wife in sex because as he would put it, he called his penis Charlie and he would say: "Charlie started taking a nap in the last few years," okay? So, we played with this cuz it's a heavy topic and so we made it lighter, right? So, we started talking and I, first of all, I would normalize that. And I'd say-, and this is what we do in EFT, we validate and normalize. We do the opposite of pathologize people and tell them they're wrong or bad or something wrong with them, right? So, we normalize it. And I would say: "When you know, you know, if you want to be close to your partner and you're gonna make love for like half an hour or forty minutes then probably Charlie in your 50s or even earlier, Charlie is probably going to take a couple of naps." And he said: "Oh, okay." 

00:42:40
RICH Nice. 

00:42:40
SUE So, first of all you normalize, right? And you say but, you know, what happens when Charlie takes a nap? Here's the thing that EFT therapist to go into the minute. And he says: "Oh, well, then you know, I'm not gonna be able to do it and, and, then I just-" 

00:43:00
RICH (inaudible ) 

00:43:02
SUE "Shutdown and she doesn't desire me anyway and I failed and-" Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's slow down. Okay, so you slow it down and you go into all his feelings of failure and fear that she will somehow be so disappointed in him, right? And she's able to come in and comfort him at that point cuz they've got emotional safety. And it gets to the point where I start saying: "It's no big deal if Charlie takes a nap if you two guys can help each other." And she, bless her heart, she's not angry anymore so, she comes and says: "I know how to have Charlie wake up." So- 

00:43:45
RICH You heard it here America and Canada Charlie therapy. It's a whole new school. 

00:43:45
RICH So, you know, now here we're talking about and then they tell me this delightful story, which you and I were talking about before the program, where they told this hilarious story where everything went wrong in their lovemaking. You know, they got interrupted by their kid; the kid came home. He said he knocked the candle over and the curtain started going on fire, I mean, everything went wrong. And of course, Charlie went for like about four naps, okay? So they-, but here's the thing, there's no-, it doesn't trigger him into all kinds attachment fear and pain and feeling that he's unlovable and that she doesn't love him. And it doesn't trigger her into "My husband doesn't want me he doesn't desire me." We've sorted that so, they can just be with each other, right? So, she's able to turn a joke or be warm and say: "Where you going? Don't you go away from me!" You know, "I don't care if Charlie takes a nap, come and give me a hug." Right? And they start to be able to move together and, actually, in the end what happened is when their kid took his friends off after about a couple of hours they had cocoa and they went back to their bedroom to have cocoa and, of course, they made love and Charlie was quite lively. 

00:45:15
RICH Good for Charlie and good for them. 

00:45:15
SUE Well, the reas- 

00:45:15
RICH So, here's the um, the shift the focus slightly here. so, I think you're-, you've given us such a uh, detailed, and lively, and fun, and playful view as how sometimes you deal with very serious people-, issues in people's lives. The key-, the thing here that I'm interested in is how do you-, what's that transition from couples being able to have the kind of intense exchange that you've been describing for us, a few moments ago, and being able to have the wherewithal to do it on their own? What is it that enables the couple-, it's one thing, and I think increasingly, therapist who are skilled therapist, skilled couple's therapists we know how to create those kinds of moments with couples and help them, coach them into finding each other in our offices. What have you-, what're you finding about how do you help them to be able to do that, the key elements here, how do they take that home and being able to, that's part of their repertoire as a couple? What's involved there and specifically if you could tell us how it is-, what are the uh, the elements of that are part of this process you're describing? 

00:46:35
SUE Rich, I think it's really-, it's about the fact that um, you know, I can remember years back when I was learning to be a therapist, I used to have this argument with Neil Jacobson about homework, okay? And Neil Jacobson used to be enraged because couples didn't do their homework, right? And I said: "Nah," you know, I was a sassy graduate student, right, and I really ticked him off, okay? And I said: "Nah, you know, of course, they don't do their homework cuz it doesn't mean anything to them, okay? Your exercises don't mean anything to them." but I think people will take out of the therapy session things that are emotionally meaningful to them, that they're engaged with. So, if they start to see their partner differently in the therapy session, why, and you can help them put that into words and integrate it, they can take it with them and they can put those glasses on when they're outside. Now, that having been said, I wrote a book called Hold Me Tight and there's exercises at the end of the chapters, okay? So, there are ways you can encourage your couples to spend time together. You can talk about what gets in the way? How can he help her feel safe and open sexually? Right? You can help her talk about her sexual needs. You can, you can, you know, suggest things to them. But I think the key thing is, it's about emotional engagement. It's about that they have new experiences in your office that are so rewarding for them, they are so rewarding that they'll go and they'll move into them at home, right? There's nothing, there's nothing more rewarding for human beings on this planet than having this longing for connection and to be seen and held and feel safely connected to have that responded to. People will seek that out again. I don't have to set it up, it's why (inaudible ). And if that gets-, that emotional connection gets teamed up with sexuality, that's such a source of joy and comfort, people, when they glimpse it they'll work, they'll do it outside, they'll try it outside, they'll work for it. Because it's-, you don't have to condition it or coach it, it's if you like, it's unconditioned, it's just who we are, we long for that- 

00:49:15
RICH Do you find if that happens so, if there's no particular structure that people need just as part of the process is what you're saying is that if they have one-, a moment like that, I mean, often couples, even if you're not a systematic couple, maybe might have a moment where people find each other, these are- 

00:49:35
SUE Well, there may, there might be more than one moment. 

00:49:40
RICH Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, but is your basic idea is that if they're able to experience this with some regularity over some period of time in your office, you don't have to give them structures and checklists and and, as you say homework that your- your experiences and your data seems to indicate that with some experience with you, people, quite naturally and spontaneously, if that's the right word here, are- are able to take this home with them. 

00:50:10
SUE These- Rich, these attachment responses, these Hold-Me-Tight conversations; you can have a Hold-Me-Tight conversation around injuries and you can have a Hold-Me-Tight conversation around sex. These basic conversations, where both people are able to be open and responsive to teach other, they are so powerful. They naturally generalize. What you do is you help couples talk about the blocks to taking them home, right? You just have to help remove the blocks. You say- somebody'll say: "I can talk about this here but I'm a bit scared to try it at home." And you'll say- you'll look at the block to that, you'll say: "What do you think is gonna happen at home?" Right? And that's- you'll help them with the block to that and you'll help them talk about their fear and how their partner can help them with that fear. Right, like I have one lady say: "When I turn and tell you, 'I need to talk to you,' I need to know that you're gonna give me your attention for a period of time. I can't have you say yes and then after ten minutes you say 'I've gotta go and do my email.'" It just freaks me out. I feel so bad. I feel like I've just opened up for you two "hurt me again." Well, I can't do it. So, he- she's able to say: "I'm afraid of this and it blocks me from doing this at home." And he's able to listen to it and say to her: "Okay, you know what? Maybe we need to have a special time. You know, when we can be together. And if you say to me you know, I want to talk to you, you know, I'll make sure that I- I will give us that time. I will give you that time. I will go turn my computer off even." Right? Maybe that's the new side of (inaudible ) in our society. 

00:52:07
RICH Yeah. 

00:52:07
SUE "I will turn my computer off." 

00:52:10
RICH Uh, no doubt, yeah. 

00:52:10
SUE Right. But, so, yes, they generalize and you open loving sexuality, synchronous sex when you're tuned in and you're emotionally tuned in and you're playful and you can tell each other what you need, you can communicate. You can let go and let the sexual dance carry you, right. That is joyful and emotional connection is joyful and if you know how to get there, you can't get there all the time. I mean, we all get stuck, okay. Um, EFT therapists, you know, joyfully share that they get stuck as well, okay. I get stuck, we all get stuck. But if you know how to get there, yeah, you better believe you'll keep reaching for it and you'll keep trying. And so, really, what we're do in EFT is we show people a new dance and how to regulate their emotions in a new way and send signals to their partner that pull'em close. That changes the bedroom and it changes every other room in the house. It changes their emotional connection, right? So, it's- that's what we're trying to do. So, we don't couch per se. What we do is we create a safe environment where they learn how to reach for each other. And you're right in that with most couples to be- when I think about it, with most couples our experience is that their sexual relationship improves as they become more open and responsive to each other emotionally. It improves. They can communicate, right? For one thing, on a different level, right? If it doesn't improve, then we will go in and directly have more open conversations about the sex, right? We'll go in and have these open conversations specifically around the sexuality. 

00:54:10
RICH Or specifically about just- so as I'm hearing- what I would put a little differently is the experience that each of them is having that they would not normally put into words with their partner. So, it's not so much the sex-- 

00:54:25
SUE That's right. 

00:54:25
RICH It's the spirit. 

00:54:25
SUE Like the big one for sexuality of course is shame. I mean, in a way the gentleman who called his penis Charlie, I mean, you could say the real issue there was not that his penis occasionally loss some of its, you know, what are we talking about here, went down slightly, okay, you could say that wasn't the issue. The issue was that he felt ashamed of it. 

00:54:55
RICH Shame. Sure. 

00:54:55
SUE And the way he dealt with that shame was to totally shutdown. And then his wife got angry with him and then we're off to the races. Their relationship is getting more and more dangerous. They're both in emotional starvation. There's no connection and comfort and the sexuality is gone. So, then they're in deep trouble really fast, right? So, sexuality touches off all this vulnerability. So, you could say the real issue is not what was happening with his penis but how he was dealing with his emotions around it. So, once you start to help him talk about the shame sand once I talk about the fact that: "Oh, you know, hey, you know, most guys their penis isn't standing to attention for like two hours at a time." You know, he says: "Oh, really." You know, I mean, this helps and his wife then helps by saying perhaps the biggest thing is the love and support our partner gives us. I mean, and that's why I wouldn't have hit this conversation right at the beginning of therapy. You have to create the emotional safety first. His wife basically said to him: "I love you, I desire you. So, what? Sometimes your penis goes to sleep for a minute, I really don't care. It's you I want, it's you I want, it's you I wanna make love to, I wanna be with you." This is the most powerful message anyone can give this man. This is better than Viagra. I mean, it's interesting, I think I was saying to you the evidence is that most people- 

00:56:25
RICH Right. 

00:56:25
SUE Fill- fill a prescription for Viagra once. Because it's out of context, you know, so, what? You could take Viagra, does that mean you could move into this dance with your partner and turn on all this sexuality and joy again? No, not necessarily. So, you know, it doesn't work. 

00:56:50
RICH EFT better than Viagra. 

00:56:55
SUE I didn't say that. 

00:56:55
RICH And now that you've- you know, people will remember that. and the other thing that kept occurring to me as you're describing this case is this might be one of the few times in uh, in therapeutic history where a man has two women on a first name basis with his penis in terms- in a consulting room. So quite- you've shared a remarkable moment here with us, Sue. And a lot of remarkable stuff here today. For now we're coming to the end of our uh- this conversation. People are going to be very curious about how they uh, training resources and how they find out more about your work. Can you- where do they do? what do they do? 

00:57:35
SUE Yes, they should go to the website um, www.iceeft.com they'll find um, training tapes, and they'll find studies, and they'll find um, references on there, on there they'll find an article what came out in the Journal of American Family Therapy about 18 months ago. Myself and Dino Zuccarini writing about sex and attachment which maybe summarizes all these things we've been talking about on a more theoretical level. They could go and read Hold-Me-Tight, particularly the sexual conversation. Because Hold-Me-Tight is a quick way into EFT. Um, they could read the Practice of Emotion Focused Couple's Therapy. Um, you know, I think these things will sort of get them into um EFT and attachment and a place that sexuality plays in attachment. Secure attachment makes for good sex, good sex makes for secure attachment, it goes together. But uh, we believe that you have to go in through the attachment, not in through the sexual technique. So, it's been fun, Rich. 

00:58:45
RICH It's been fun and those of you who would like to continue the fun, let me call your attention, yet again, to our comment board. Share your thoughts, share your free associations, share your questions. Sue has- Sue has agreed to uh, look but not guaranteeing that she will write a treatise in response but she'll look at your comments and at the very least it'll conversations that uh, Sue has started with us here today. So uh, take advantage of the comment board. Sue, what a pleasure, what fun, and uh, what interesting work you're doing. Keep it up. Thanks so much for spending time with us. 

00:59:25
SUE Take care, Rich. 

00:59:25
RICH That's it from Networker Webcast: Attachment Theory in Action. See you next time. Bye-bye.
