00:00:45
JOE BELLIL Welcome to Miller Chat. I'm Joe Bellil, today’s host with my friends Sonya Perduta… 

00:00:50
SONYA PERDUTA Hi. 

00:00:50
JOE BELLIL …Mike Kennedy. 

00:00:50
MIKE KENNEDY Hi. 

00:00:50
JOE BELLIL Millerchat Mike’s and Sonya’s Friend And today Robin will be producing and directing the show. So I thank you for joining us. Today’s topic “Political Correctness Disability Style”. We’re going to be talking about some different lang… use of languages ah… relating to people of disabilities and the proper use and the improper use of that language. We’re also going to talk about how some of that language came into being. A couple of things you keep in mind, one is although as you can tell all three of us have some sort of disability, we don’t represent all disabilities. And if you really want to find out the right terminology ask the person who has a disability or if the person is not able to communicate that ask somebody who is an expert or knows about the field, that’s important. We’re here to give you our opinions and ba...based on our past experiences. So I’m going to start today by first word “handicapped”. The handicap a lot of times people use and I actually use it myself once a while when we're talking about handicapped parking, it’s important and especially when you are looking for parking, you talk to an attendant you say look I’m looking for the handicapped parking. If I’d say the parking for people with disabilities they may not understand. The proper term is to use would be a person, a person with the disability or individual disability and handicap is from the English. 

00:02:15
Miller Chat 

00:02:15
JOE BELLIL Millerchat Mike's and Sonya's Friend Now some people think it’s from the English when a person use to have a cap out, we had a disability and would collect money in order to survive. But actually is from betting, betting on horses and where people would put money in a cap and, and, and if they came out with money in their hands they’d actually make a bet or if they left the money in the cap it would be forfeited. And Handicap came from a horse that was, that would be the best horse and in order for it to be more of an equal type of race, the horse would be burdened or had extra weight on it. Thus a person with the disability has a burden thus handicap. So the word, words have come from different way um areas and, and terminology and sometimes at one point in time it was appropriate, but now the proper term is person with the disability, unless you're talking about handicapped parking. Mike you add a word! 

00:03:20
MIKE KENNEDY Millerchat Joe’s and Sonya’s Friend Yeah, um my little ah you know peppy word is physically challenged. I believe that was a claim by um Ted Kennedy Jr. who had to have one of his legs amputated due to a cancer. And Kennedy associated it you know with his skiing he is a skier like a lot of the other Kennedys and when you think of the word challenge, it’s, it’s, it’s like a bold attempt to achieve ah something higher than you did before, whether it would be um you know kicking a football ah you know to the field goal you know 50 yards away instead of 45. That’s the challenge try to kick it 5 yards further. But I mean a person with the disability ah it's you know just trying to ah you know do their you know, ah every day you know activities. It’s not a challenge to them. They don’t choose to kick a ball you know five yards further. I mean, they're just doing basic survival. You know just trying to ah do what they have to do to um achieve their goals. So, it’s, I could say it’s not a challenge I mean, people with disabilities don’t choose to ah you know, ah they don’t choose to um let’s say how do I describe that? Yeah. It’s a, it’s not a choice like challenges. 

00:04:45
JOE BELLIL Like entering a sports of that or something right. 

00:04:50
MIKE KENNEDY Right, I mean something like that I mean yeah, the challenge is to fear in a race you want to finish quicker than the other person. 

00:04:55
JOE BELLIL And now Sonya has something about wheelchair bound, oh. 

00:05:00
SONYA PERDUTA Millerchat Joe’s and Mike’s Friend Right. The, the two words I’m gonna or the two phrases I’d like to talk about at this point is wheelchair bound and confined to a wheelchair. Um confined to a wheelchair is an interesting term um basically meaning that you have no other means of getting around except using a wheelchair, ah which would probably be a better way to say instead of saying confined to a wheelchair because when you actually think of a wheelchair, wheelchair is actually a freeing ah agent, it allows you to freely move around your environment when your legs don’t really function any longer. So, you’re really not confined to a wheelchair. The wheelchair is freeing and allows you to move, move about society. I suppose that a wheelchair would be confining if you were a high quadriplegic, which is a person who couldn’t use his arms or his legs or a person or she who couldn’t use her arms or her legs and their, um lets say their HMO or their health care insurance company didn’t buy them a powered wheelchair and they had made them sit in a manual wheelchair which is like um all our wheelchairs were it doesn’t have any type of power to it with motorized function. Um then that person would be confined to the wheelchair ‘coz that’s pretty much how we'd do, it would be sit all day long in that manual wheelchair not be able to move without the assistance of somebody else. So that would kind of be confined. But in general I believe within the disability community confined to a wheelchair is totally inappropriate because again it’s a freeing agent. Um but in the term wheelchair bound um wheelchair bound is an interesting topic or an interesting term. It’s used a lot in the medical profession and I'm a nurse so I’ve heard quite a bit. But wheelchair bound, I have a story to tell. 

00:06:35
Miller Chat 

00:06:35
SONYA PERDUTA Millerchat Joe’s and Mike’s Friend One day I was at team meeting which is at a, it was at a Rehab hospital and lets say we had a team meeting and that with these means we talked about the progress of patients and we had one patient who has been discharged and needed an apartment. And we needed to fill out appropriate paperwork for him. So, the resident, the physician who was in charge that day didn’t know how to fill the paperwork so someone else just said, write wheelchair bound. The whole table they must have been like 12 people they all got in an uproar because wheelchair bound is really inappropriate, inappropriate term because you know wheelchair bound means you are tied or restricted to your wheelchair and again remember the term wheelchair is really a freeing it allows you to roam freely through your environment well as long as it is an accessible environment. But it allows you to roam freely. So, everyone was in chaos and uproar kind of telling this resident they had used inappropriate language. And all of a sudden of course me being the only person in that team meeting who happened to be in a wheelchair. They all turned around and looked at me wanting me to say something. So, I thought about it and thought about it and my response to that was to me wheelchair bound can’t, wheelchair bound contours up images of some SNM(ph) activity actually. You know, I get to thinking of leathers and tied to wheelchairs in that fashion and it’s sort of a like a sexual connotation and not necessarily a normal type of activity. So, of course the whole team meeting everyone was hysterically laughing except the resident physician. The resident physician turned to us and said what does SNM(ph) mean? That’s when I really had problems and was really concerned about the, the practice of medicine at that point. But that’s my little story about wheelchair bound. Um I would prefer that people visualize someone really sexy sitting in a wheelchair tied with leathers instead of an inability to move around in their environment. So, that’s pretty much might take wheelchair bound. 

00:08:25
JOE BELLIL Great story. 

00:08:25
MIKE KENNEDY I like that. 

00:08:30
SONYA PERDUTA It does seems(ph) to be a good story. 

00:08:30
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. (crosstalk)(inaudible ) sexy you know, you know with tied up to the wheelchair, that’s, that’s a good idea. 

00:08:35
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. 

00:08:35
MIKE KENNEDY Millerchat Joe’s and Sonya’s Friend And other thing about confined to a wheelchair or wheelchair bound I mean, just all people know out there in the audience I mean when the three of us go to bed at night. It’s not like we have the wheelchair still attached to us in the bed. I mean, like say, we are not, we are not wheelchair bound. We are just people ah who use chairs. 

00:08:55
JOE BELLIL I was thinking of duct tape. When somebody says wheelchair bound, I feel like some things like tied with duct tape around their chair and not able to move at all. 

00:09:05
SONYA PERDUTA I understand. 

00:09:05
MIKE KENNEDY Well, Sonya and I like that to think of with the leather and the chains. I mean, but you know, that’s, you know, that’s… 

00:09:10
SONYA PERDUTA Duct tape is a good one. 

00:09:10
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. But duct tape is good. 

00:09:10
JOE BELLIL I don’t know. It just popped in my mind. 

00:09:15
MIKE KENNEDY Yes. 

00:09:15
SONYA PERDUTA They say that duct tape is good for anything. 

00:09:15
MIKE KENNEDY Right, probably I could not use it. haahaha. 

00:09:20
JOE BELLIL You know, another interesting thing, when you were talking you mentioned electric chair. 

00:09:25
SONYA PERDUTA Oh yes. Electric is bad. 

00:09:25
JOE BELLIL Yeah. It’s powered chair now. 

00:09:25
SONYA PERDUTA Yes. 

00:09:30
JOE BELLIL Right, but in the past, just in the recent past I don’t know, five years ago, I think electric chair was acceptable but now it’s a powered chair even though it’s operated by a battery sources. But if you think of an electric chair, it’s a, that’s not a positive term. 

00:09:45
SONYA PERDUTA Right, electric chair is, is really, when some one thinks of that they think of the penal system and someone being electrocuted because of some sort of you know, horrific crime they committed and, then you can see that I grew up, I’ve been sitting in the chair now for what 26 years and working in the medical field. So, electric chair comes really easy to me that's why I said it, I didn’t even know I said it because I’ve been trying to train myself to say powered chair from now on. So, it’s, he’s right, electric chair is not the good term to use. 

00:10:10
JOE BELLIL Ah it’s taken me a while too. I mean, because we always used to refer to it that way but now it’s power chair or motorized... 

00:10:15
SONYA PERDUTA ...chair. 

00:10:15
JOE BELLIL ...chair. 

00:10:15
Miller Chat 

00:10:15
SONYA PERDUTA Exactly. 

00:10:20
JOE BELLIL So, it is just we are always catching up on these new terms. 

00:10:20
MIKE KENNEDY Right. It just goes (inaudible ) even a you know, three of us who have had disabilities for many years. You know, ah it some times we ah you know forget that terms change. 

00:10:30
SONYA PERDUTA It mean we use inappropriate language too? 

00:10:35
MIKE KENNEDY You know what, believe it or not we do. 

00:10:35
SONYA PERDUTA Yes. 

00:10:35
MIKE KENNEDY I mean you know we are not perfect. We are not perfect. 

00:10:40
JOE BELLIL We are close to it though. 

00:10:40
MIKE KENNEDY Well, yeah. I think so. 

00:10:40
JOE BELLIL Alright. Yeah. It’s a disability thing right? 

00:10:45
MIKE KENNEDY Right. Right. 

00:10:45
JOE BELLIL Do you know one thing that influences the public is the media. 

00:10:50
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah, definitely. 

00:10:50
JOE BELLIL And I think you, you have something about an article that was in the Telegram & Gazette. 

00:10:55
MIKE KENNEDY Millerchat Joe’s and Sonya’s Friend Yeah, I mean, this is very recent too by the way. Ah within the past two months, ah a terrible story unfortunately, a you know person with a disability, I guess on the second floor of an apartment building, you know, died in a fire. And you know, because she couldn’t get out of her house and you know how they, you know referenced her was an invalid. Now, people this is 2002. I, I, I think invalid goes back to oh my God! When I was a kid reading, sorry! Wrong number or some kind of short story. 

00:11:30
Miller Chat 

00:11:35
MIKE KENNEDY That was about this invalid who is in trouble trying to you know call, call a help. This was obviously before 911 days but invalid. Invalid. What is that mean? Invalid, not valid. I mean, I’m sorry, I mean, I might have a disability but I’m valid. 

00:11:55
JOE BELLIL You are. 

00:11:55
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. 

00:11:55
MIKE KENNEDY Thank you Joe. Thank you Sonya. 

00:11:55
SONYA PERDUTA We are all worth of something. Yes. 

00:11:55
MIKE KENNEDY That’s right. 

00:12:00
SONYA PERDUTA Definitely. 

00:12:00
JOE BELLIL I think of like a stamp on your forehead. You know, you know invalid. 

00:12:00
SONYA PERDUTA Like the scar, like the scarlet let, the scarlet letter on your chest. 

00:12:05
JOE BELLIL Oh yeah! 

00:12:05
SONYA PERDUTA Yes. You should have the big eye may be on our foreheads. 

00:12:05
JOE BELLIL Or rejected or something. 

00:12:10
JOE BELLIL It’s, now one of my other really words that really bother me is cripple. 

00:12:15
SONYA PERDUTA Yes. Cripple. Cripple is, is a bad word yes. 

00:12:20
JOE BELLIL And do you have anything like that? 

00:12:25
SONYA PERDUTA Millerchat Joe’s and Mike’s Friend Well. But I looked it up in the dictionary and cripple means, the definition or one definition of it is a lame or partially disabled person or animal which is some times taken to be offensive. And it said some times taken to be offensive. I would say in the disability community it’s gonna be taken offensively almost every time you say it. Certain people like to use it as a disempowering word. They use it to empower themselves versus having able-bodied society use it to disempower them, but I would say most people in the disability community are considered that to be almost similar to the, to the end word in relation to the African-American community. So, it’s not a term to be, to be used and it actually makes me cringe. One time, I was. Another story, I love to tell stories. One time I was at a restaurant in the town where I grew up or excuse me the town I have my house in right now and we were, ah we left the restaurant we filed a complaint against them because they had remodeled the bathroom and didn’t make it accessible, wheelchair accessible which they were mandated to do by law and we were there waiting for the Architectural Access Board representative to come in and the owner pulled me aside and sat with me. And he, this is what he did to me. I’m gonna do it on Joe just you’ll get an idea of what it was like and what he actually said to me. But um he turned and he said with this finger raging like this he said, “You cripple people should stay at home and mind your own business.” Something like that. He was throwing his finger on my face. I wanted to bite that finger. But I know if I did it he would basically. 

00:14:00
JOE BELLIL Sue you. 

00:14:00
SONYA PERDUTA Sue me or have me charged with assault. Because he had done a similar thing to another person um, a friend of mine, Tom is actually friend of all us. Tom who is an amputee and he needs to use a wheelchair now, he can no longer walk, (inaudible ) on crutches because he was doing it too long, his shoulders gave out. 

00:14:20
Miller Chat 

00:14:20
SONYA PERDUTA But he actually did the same thing to him and said to him that I’m gonna use this terminology. He said, “you cripple people should piss at home before you go out.” And meaning that you don’t need to use our rest rooms and he almost attacked down me as well. It’s just not a good word to use that cripple is very bad. It connotates lots of negative things to people with disabilities and, and we um we need to have some disability prides sort of speak and we are trying to you know, weed out all those words that are not really good. Don’t you think? 

00:14:50
JOE BELLIL Oh! Yeah. 

00:14:50
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:14:50
JOE BELLIL The power thing though, like you said, I mean, first I bet you with standing upright. 

00:14:55
SONYA PERDUTA Oh of course. Yeah. 

00:14:55
JOE BELLIL A person who is standing up and looking down… 

00:15:00
SONYA PERDUTA …down at you, yes, yeah the height thing you know. 

00:15:00
JOE BELLIL And then pointing and just making you… 

00:15:05
SONYA PERDUTA Well, I mean his finger was, was that far from my nose. I just wanted to bite it but I just knew I would go to jail, if I bit him, for assault ‘coz he would have had me arrested for sure. 

00:15:10
JOE BELLIL The view some people have in the way they do that that’s just… 

00:15:20
SONYA PERDUTA ...was not a good feeling. Didn’t make me feeling good. 

00:15:20
MIKE KENNEDY Right now cripple is at the… is like the first word that had connotations with people with disabilities. I mean, is that even before invalid, because invalid may be a euphemism for a cripple or some thing. Um see fortunately I don’t go back far back. Ha…ha…ha… So, I don’t actually know, you know, how far that’s been used. 

00:15:45
JOE BELLIL I think that’s one of the oldest words, I would guess. 

00:15:50
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. I would think so too. I’m not sure of that though but I’ve, I mean that’s been in a lot of literature and… 

00:15:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:15:55
SONYA PERDUTA Said a lot unfortunately. 

00:16:00
MIKE KENNEDY And I know ah you know my first couple of experiences with the word cripple, I mean, ah you know my spinal cord injury was back in 1974 and that was the reference word. In fact, at the Mass Hospital School, I remember riding in the back of the ambulance to, you know, for my rehabilitation and I look out, um I’m looking out of the window and just then I see this sign, Mass Hospital School for Crippled Children. It was like, oh boy, it is something really wrong here. What’s going on? And you know, it’s some thing like that I mean that kind of negativity. It you know, I had to work that much harder you know, mentally to say, hey look! I’m not crippled. I’m going to you know, make the best of I can you know, out of my life. 

00:16:50
JOE BELLIL Yeah. It’s again then having the crippled part first. I mean, the actually the terrible word but having the crippled part first and then the person. 

00:16:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:16:55
JOE BELLIL You know as though you are cripple and then you are Mike. 

00:17:00
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:17:00
JOE BELLIL You know… 

00:17:00
MIKE KENNEDY Yes. cripple Mike. 

00:17:00
JOE BELLIL Imagine if you, imagine if we’re looking at any body else and pointing at their limitations first and then addressing them by name. 

00:17:10
SONYA PERDUTA Right. No. 

00:17:10
JOE BELLIL I mean, that’s, that’s one way of looking at it. 

00:17:10
MIKE KENNEDY Right it would be like hey fat John. Ha..ha..ha.. 

00:17:15
SONYA PERDUTA Exactly. Exactly. 

00:17:20
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah or short Sandy or whatever I mean, it’s just, just so negative. You know, we always like it yeah, you know, we mentioned before and I’m sure we’ll mention it again before the end of the show is that um always emphasize the person first because people are people. First. 

00:17:35
JOE BELLIL And respect them. 

00:17:40
SONYA PERDUTA So you don’t consider yourself crippled or handicapped. What do we call ourselves other than person with disabilities? I guess some, are we considered the normal word? 

00:17:50
JOE BELLIL Yeah. Yeah. The normal word. 

00:17:50
SONYA PERDUTA The normal word, yes. 

00:17:50
JOE BELLIL That’s interesting. 

00:17:55
SONYA PERDUTA Right. 

00:17:55
MIKE KENNEDY Normal. 

00:17:55
SONYA PERDUTA What’s normal and what is abnormal? I mean, people have asked me whether I considered myself normal? I’ve always said oh yes, compared to the rest of you both side(ph) I suppose I’m normal but I don’t feel abnormal just ‘coz I can’t walk. 

00:18:10
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:18:10
SONYA PERDUTA I mean, it doesn’t, I still do everything else. 

00:18:10
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:18:10
SONYA PERDUTA You know, brush my teeth, wash my hair, wash my face you know, feed my kid those kind of things so it’s…, 

00:18:15
MIKE KENNEDY Which is good. That why we’re here that’s why yeah you’re friend of us. Ha…ha…ha. 

00:18:25
JOE BELLIL If she didn’t she may not be right. 

00:18:25
SONYA PERDUTA Right. What if I don’t brush my teeth or okay, not bad. 

00:18:30
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. Now, we may be normal and you know that’s such a funny word I mean what is normal? I mean, I think you know that particular term has been ah mould over. You know probably, oh my God! Couple of centuries now. You know, whether we overcome(ph) beers or a coffee or you know at lunch, you know with the (inaudible ) co-workers, normal. Ha…ha…ha. 

00:18:51
JOE BELLIL I was looking at like a disability is some what are the limitation and I, and I view that when I meet somebody, I assume they have a disability and unless they tell me they don’t have a disability and then I question them, if they really don’t a disability because I don’t know too many people they don’t have some sort of limitation. That’s on their life. You know whether there’s physical, mental… 

00:19:15
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:19:15
JOE BELLIL …environmental, you know emotionally... 

00:19:20
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:19:20
JOE BELLIL It could be a number of different things and it is always important, I always address the person first you know… 

00:19:25
MIKE KENNEDY Oh yeah. 

00:19:25
JOE BELLIL You may see different things and they see some… they may see the limitation by, like for example using a chair were you pointed out perfectly, a chair is a useful tool. 

00:19:30
SONYA PERDUTA Right. 

00:19:35
JOE BELLIL I mean that’s I see this tool is kind of actually it’s fun and different you know, in different ways it is very useful in… 

00:19:35
MIKE KENNEDY Oh sure. 

00:19:40
JOE BELLIL …getting us around and everything else. Now it is like a pair of sneakers but um I know I think everyone has limitation and it is important to not look at that first, like you said. 

00:19:50
MIKE KENNEDY Exactly. 

00:19:50
JOE BELLIL Respect the person first and then go on. How about some other terms. 

00:19:55
SONYA PERDUTA I don’t know which ones you wanna go, right now. 

00:19:55
JOE BELLIL I thought one like pegleg. 

00:20:00
SONYA PERDUTA Oh! Pegleg. 

00:20:00
MIKE KENNEDY Peglegs. 

00:20:00
JOE BELLIL Yeah. 

00:20:00
MIKE KENNEDY Wow! 

00:20:00
SONYA PERDUTA For ampt.. some with an amputation. 

00:20:05
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. 

00:20:05
JOE BELLIL Yeah. 

00:20:05
SONYA PERDUTA Well, see for me that would be a hard. I would never call any body pegleg. But actually once no man who had a mahogany carved peg that he would walk around just like a pirate(ph). He had a, an amputee lower limb and he used the peg just to make people look more at him. That was kind of interesting but yeah pegleg is an interesting word. 

00:20:25
MIKE KENNEDY Alright. Is that from the pyrites(ph) when you know that’s how they had if ah you know they lost a limb in that battle? 

00:20:30
JOE BELLIL I’m not sure, probably somewhere around that. 

00:20:35
SONYA PERDUTA Pegleg. 

00:20:35
Mike Kennedy Millerchat Joe’s and Sonya’s Friend And you know, on tees that’s what it had been ah you know because I play a lot of wheelchair basketball and you know, people with, you know, lower extremity amputations are, you know, eligible to play wheelchair basketball volunteers(ph). I’ve never called any of them Peglegs. Hahaha you know, even after they you know, kick me around a little bit on the court. But I don’t know, may be I can use that just to throw the ball(ph), throw ball(ph) they give a little bit. 

00:21:00
JOE BELLIL Right. 

00:21:00
MIKE KENNEDY Assuming they’ve smaller peglegs than me ha..ha..ha.. 

00:21:05
SONYA PERDUTA Millerchat Joe’s and Mike’s Friend Yeah. you know, actually we are sitting here now, we are talking about that we within the community use, we use these words when we discuss each other and I guess it’s important to know that it’s okay for us within our community to do that but it’s not okay for anyone outside our community to do that unless you are you know, really well known to us. Does that make sense? I mean, I think that’s really clear to know like even within other discriminated populations, they use again negative terminology with amongst themselves but again to ah make those words powerless and that’s part of what we do it too. We joke and kid with each other and call each other you know, gimp or spas or… 

00:21:45
JOE BELLIL Right. 

00:21:45
SONYA PERDUTA …or cripple which is a common term within our community, crip and what do you guys think? I mean, is that still right. 

00:21:50
Miller Chat 

00:21:50
JOE BELLIL Yeah. 

00:21:50
MIKE KENNEDY I had no doubt about it. It ah but you know, we know when we call each other these kind of disparagic names that we not, we ah really don’t mean it. 

00:22:00
SONYA PERDUTA They are actually terms of endearment are they not? 

00:22:05
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. 

00:22:05
JOE BELLIL But there is an, there is an understanding as you said, I mean, this is the, we have the feel, you know. 

00:22:10
MIKE KENNEDY Exactly. 

00:22:10
JOE BELLIL …in terms of cripple and we make fun of that or whatever. We understand, we have that understanding we felt it at different times in our lives. 

00:22:15
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:22:20
JOE BELLIL And you’re right. It’s a sharing of that way. 

00:22:20
MIKE KENNEDY And understand to, you know we’ve known each other like oh 10 or 11 years now too. So, I mean, yeah we’ve had many conversations where you know these kind of a joking terms can come up. 

00:22:35
JOE BELLIL Millerchat Mike’s and Sonya’s Friend Before we, definitely before we end I wanted to take some of the other words too On the other types of disabilities. May be less physical and the sensory type disabilities. I think one of the, one of the words, I never heard for blink. 

00:22:50
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. Blink is a term for blind people. Blink yeah. 

00:22:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right. And who actually thought us that word was ah you know, ah blind water skier friend of us that we know very well has a, an incredible sense of humor. And you know, so we were just talking about ah our terms and despair in each in terms I didn’t really know she was probably the first ah you know, visually impaired person that I that I really was getting to know. So, I said so, you know, us with the physically disabilities you know, cripple, invalid, those are nasty words. And you know what’s, what’s your bad word and (inaudible ) you were sitting in the same conversation, ah you know, ah with me ah Sonya and that’s how where we heard that word. 

00:23:35
JOE BELLIL Interesting. Now, what about ah deaf and dumb? Or mute… 

00:23:45
SONYA PERDUTA Deaf and dumb, yeah. 

00:23:45
JOE BELLIL Yeah. Again. Because the person doesn’t speak or… 

00:23:50
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:23:50
JOE BELLIL Or uses different type of sign language or something like that. What a terrible expression. 

00:23:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right. I mean, the certainly dumb I mean, just be I mean, a person from another country can’t speak the same language you do, doesn’t mean they are dumb. 

00:24:05
JOE BELLIL Exactly. 

00:24:05
SONYA PERDUTA Alright, in the deaf community I guess, when they use the word deaf, it’s usually always capitalized. Deaf, they are the Deaf community and not a small, lower case, capital ‘D’ for Deaf but in again dumb. Dumb back I guess, when they were using it it really signified the inability to speak dumb. But you know as it progress through the centuries or whatever I mean it became dumb meaning stupid so that really is not a good term again either. It is just a deaf community, yeah. People who are deaf or can’t hear or hard of hearing or you know or late deafened I mean… 

00:24:45
JOE BELLIL Yeah. 

00:24:45
SONYA PERDUTA There is so many different terminologies. 

00:24:45
JOE BELLIL That’s why it is important to definitely check, check with some of this very knowledgeable if you are specially doing a presentation or going to be addressing a group of folks um what about folks with cognitive disabilities? Okay, word retard other types of words like that again… 

00:25:05
SONYA PERDUTA Low intelligence, retard. 

00:25:05
JOE BELLIL Low intelligence. 

00:25:10
SONYA PERDUTA Oh! What do they call? Sped, a sped. 

00:25:15
JOE BELLIL Oh yes sped. 

00:25:15
SONYA PERDUTA Sped, Special education kids are called speds in the school. I can tell you, because I have a teenage daughter in her angry stages, why do they just call me a sped right to my face. But was not taken well by me but um sped is term as well and it’s not really… and it’s actually even used I think in the educational community to show in the term of special education to sped. But it’s actually taken a negative connotation because the kids in the school are actually called kids, speds with the derogatory tones in their voice and stuffs. 

00:25:50
MIKE KENNEDY Right. And Sonya you know what if it’s ah it’s too funny um I was at, you know the Millbury Public Library yesterday and you know at the you know, the librarian who assisted me in ah you know finding a you know certain book ah you know, I was you know telling her how I was getting the dictionary to you know get words out for our discussion we are gonna have with the Team G(ph) at next week. And she says, says yeah speaking of ah you know ah disparaging in our words ah you know I have a daughter who is a you know, a special education student and she says she is worried of sped all the time and it’s, it does not set well with her. 

00:26:40
SONYA PERDUTA Alright. So, can you, you imagine a young child who has a disabilities already being taunted and sneered at and I guess, may be for those of you who in the temporarily able-bodied community, we call you guys tabs. Tabs for Temporarily Able-Bodied. Um but those of you who are out there who may wear glasses you would probably know pretty well what that feels like when you were in the second grade or third grade and you were called four eyes all the time um that would be a similar feeling only and would never go away with us. We gotta carried through adulthood as well. So, just those kind of… 

00:27:15
JOE BELLIL Something to disempower a person. 

00:27:15
SONYA PERDUTA Right. To keep them down, to make them feel lower or less than the rest of society and that’s something that unfortunately our community has been the (inaudible ) for, for as I said, since the beginning of time I believe. 

00:27:30
MIKE KENNEDY Right, right. 

00:27:30
JOE BELLIL So, it’s interesting term. 

00:27:35

SONYA PERDUTA And I do that when I lecture, I lecture sometimes where special people with special needs who need to ride on special transportation to go to special schools for special curriculums. For all this special stuff, we are just special. Isn’t it pep in at times? I’m so special. But anyways it’s a... 

00:28:05
JOE BELLIL It’s great. Hahaha 

00:28:10
MIKE KENNEDY No actually it is superintendence(ph) but that’s okay. 

00:28:10

SONYA PERDUTA Superintendence. Oh thanks! But thank you for correcting that. 

00:28:15
MIKE KENNEDY Not a problem. 

00:28:15
SONYA PERDUTA But anyway I feel special is not… I don’t like. Do you like special? You like being special Joe? 

00:28:20
JOE BELLIL Um not disability related, sure. 

00:28:20
SONYA PERDUTA Ha..ha..ha.. 

00:28:25
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:28:25
JOE BELLIL As a special person you know but… 

00:28:25
MIKE KENNEDY Good (inaudible ). 

00:28:26
JOE BELLIL You’re right. A lot times it’s more relating to disability. 

00:28:26
SONYA PERDUTA Disability. 

00:28:30
JOE BELLIL And that’s simply I never even thought about sped. 

00:28:30
SONYA PERDUTA Sped oh special sped. 

00:28:35
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:28:35
SONYA PERDUTA What about hero or you know super crip or… 

00:28:40
MIKE KENNEDY Okay. 

00:28:40
SONYA PERDUTA Those are terms that is such a hero or strongest. I’ve been the called the strong soldier so many times. 

00:28:45
MIKE KENNEDY Right. Oh I admire your courage. 

00:28:50
SONYA PERDUTA yes admiration courage, yes. 

00:28:50
MIKE KENNEDY Right. Because no it’s funny I mean um you know just, you know when we’re just going to you know daily routines um I guess, you know some people find it inspiration ah to see us getting out of the car and go into store and buy a couple of groceries. I mean, people, it’s not a big deal. I mean, it’s you know when I ride, you know super crips are not super heroes I mean, if you need a gallon of milk and some cereals and bananas well, you know, we got to get them, we got to get them. 

00:29:20
SONYA PERDUTA And if... and if we don’t think we put our feet in our mouth. Ha…ha…ha…we put our whole wheelchair into our mouth. 

00:29:30
MIKE KENNEDY Exactly. 

00:29:30
SONYA PERDUTA I do anyway, I know that. 

00:29:30
MIKE KENNEDY Exactly. 

00:29:30
JOE BELLIL We are gonna be closing up. Umm Sonya any final comments? 

00:29:35
SONYA PERDUTA No, I think just what we have reiterated over and over just that always um use person first or individual first. Always address that person as a person and don’t ever call them a wheelchair or I’ve been called a wheelchair once or twice and I think that’s the most important thing. As the individual is a person first and always ask. 

00:29:55
JOE BELLIL Right. 

00:29:55
SONYA PERDUTA If you are not comfortable with what, what should I say, ask what is the appropriate term to use. 

00:30:05
MIKE KENNEDY It make sense I mean, I couldn’t you know put any better than that. I mean, really I mean, you know people first.
