Bullies to Buddies: From problem management to developing crucial social skills in ALL children with Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
This video is based on the following two books (free chapters at www.skillionaire.org) "The Skill-ionaire in EVERY Child” "Boosting ALL Children’s Social and Emotional Brain Power” 

00:00:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hi. I’m Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin, and today I’d like to talk about the importance of broadening our focus from containing problems such as bullying to boosting children’s emerging social networks for social skill. Great efforts have been placed into preventing bullying, and it’s important because children cannot learn effectively if the environment is not safe. However, our well intended effort to focus on bullying has ironically led us to lose sight of many other important and interconnected skills which might better accomplish our goals. Bullying, for example, is less likely to occur if children have extensively developed the skills of empathy and compassion. Teasing is less likely to occur if children see each other as buddies. Young people are less likely to resort to hurtful actions if they feel connected and appreciated and part of the community. On top of this, many educators at all levels now wish for more social intelligence in their classrooms. They see a need for a great variety of skills. 

00:01:45
Virgie Blancas, Teacher Kathryn Hughes Elementary 

00:01:45
VIRGIE BLANCAS One would be to have kindness, because it’s important for children to get along in the classroom and also just kindness. Along with kindness comes compassion for other children, and, uh, just understanding how other children feel if, let’s say, if, uh, a conflict arises and they can stop and try and understand each other. And first of all, be kind to each other just so that, uh, the conflict, they can find out why there is conflict. So, kindness would be one of them. A second social skill would be to, I guess, understanding the big picture when walking into the classroom, because I am a classroom teacher. 

00:02:35
Virginia Penders, Principal Vinci Park Elementary 

00:02:35
VIRGINIA PENDERS The socio-emotional skills that are important for children to succeed early in life is definitely self esteem and confidence. If a child has self esteem and confidence, they are more able to participate in class and to be more engaged in the activities. And even more importantly, to take risks in the classroom. If a child does not have self confidence, and they do not feel that they are worthy, without that self worth, they’re not going to offer up any suggestions in the classroom because they’re afraid that everybody’s going to make fun of them. So that’s why the self confidence and a high self esteem will really assist a child in becoming very successful in their early years of education. 

00:03:20
Mrs. Roldan, Teacher Anderson Elementary 

00:03:20
MS. ROLDAN What I think is really important is empathy and having kids understand what empathy means. 

00:03:25
Mrs. Macias, Teacher Anderson Elementary 

00:03:25
MRS. MACIAS Another important social skill is self awareness. In my classroom we do a lot of cooperative learning, and so children have to work together, and they have to listen, and they have to take turns. And children with better social skills will be able to have better experiences, and will be able to interact successfully with their peers. 

00:03:45
Beth Henderson, Retired Teacher 

00:03:45
BETH HENDERSON Well, I think if the social skills are, are practiced and used, uh, on a consistent basis, uh, your ability to take in information in class academically, be able to share that information with others will rise because you’re not having to compete with those people who are not focused on the learning part. 

00:04:15
Lori King, Principal Discover 2 

00:04:15
LORI KING By giving kids these skills and the ability to figure out what they need, understand what they need, and that it’s okay to have needs and feelings, uh, we don’t really see bullying because there’s an alternative way to get needs met. They’re not victims, and they have these tools. They are empowered. The adults believe in them, and they have a voice. 

00:04:40
Patricia Belvel, Educational Consultant Author of "Rethinking Classroom Management” 

00:04:40
PATRICIA BELVEL For children, when they look at their own behavior and they’re analyzing that it develops intrinsic motivation because it feels good to do the right thing. They begin to feel good when they’re helping others, when they’re, uh, assisting another child who has a problem. When I saw Marie-Nathalie processing an activity with students in the classroom, and I saw the empowerment that they felt when they had that "Aha!” moment of "Yes, I escaped. I didn’t get into it with that child. I, I used my words.” They could articulate what it was they were doing, and I think that’s empowering. 

00:05:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Educators would like so many skills now in their classroom. They would like more flexibility, empathy. They would like self awareness, self reflection, impulse control, patience, forgiveness. The list is endless. Is it possible to develop all these skills, especially considering the limited amount of time that educators have? Well, the good news is that it is, especially if we take into consideration some interesting facts about the brain and the mind. 

00:05:50
IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF BRAIN AND MIND FUNCTIONING 1. Problems’ hold on the brain 2. Brain wiring for skills 3. Thought process ans synaptic density 4. Emotional versus intellectual information processing. 

00:05:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN A brief overview of important aspects of brain and mind functioning. I will discuss problems’ hold on the brain, brain wiring for skills, thought process and synaptic density and emotional versus intellectual information processing. 

00:06:15
PROBLEMS’ HOLD ON THE BRAIN Problems have often been reinforced by some of the most powerful neural encoders that exist: Negative emotions Attention Repetition 

00:06:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Let's start with problems' hold on the brain. Problems, such as bullying, have often been reinforced by some of the most powerful neural encoders that exist: negative emotions, attention and repetition. I am reminded here of Charlie, who had the habit of shoving other students when they told him he was out at kickball. He felt it was unfair. In those situations, everyone would be upset at Charlie: the student he pushed, the others who witnessed it, the yard duty who’d sent him to the office, his teacher and the principal who would discipline him. And then, he would ultimately go home where he would get another layer of consequences, such as having anything fun removed from bedroom for that evening or longer. It was very difficult for Charlie to forget the problem. He would dwell in it for hours, with every single minute of this rumination, strengthening the neural networks for resentment in his brain. After an event like that, the likelihood that Charlie could come to school the next day and interact kindly and patiently with peers was very small. The likelihood that peers would want to play and interact with him was also reduced, ironically making them tempted to unfairly exclude him, which supported the problem. Maybe then there was a little unfairness there. The amount of negative interactions that Charlie got with everyone progressively increased his amount of frustration when he already struggled to manage the first feeling about the unfairness around being kicked out. Charlie was stuck in the downward spiral of negative emotions, which had a strong hold on his brain. Stronger, in fact, than all his good intentions to stop being in trouble. Because of the mismatch between the fast development of emotional systems and the slower development of the thinking part of the brain, Charlie’s intense negative emotions had a much stronger hold on his brain than all his genuine intentions to change. 

00:09:00
Good Intentions Are Not Enough 

00:09:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Good intentions alone are often not enough. When I first met Charlie, he cried and asked if it was possible to get a new brain because even though he hated his life and he didn’t want to react that way, he often found himself doing it anyway. 

00:09:20
Strong Negative Emotions Override the Brain 

00:09:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Strong negative emotions override the brain. Eventually people didn’t like Charlie because all they saw was his demands for fairness, his intense desire to play. He was benched at recess a lot, which also made those feelings grow even bigger and harder to contain. 

00:09:40
Efforts are often in the shadow of our mind 

00:09:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN People only saw the growing resentment and frustration in Charlie. They didn’t see his efforts to contain the problem. In fact, efforts are often in the shadow of our mind. People did not know, for example, how caring and kind he was with his little brother and his terminally ill mother. People didn’t know how abusive his father could be and how he was always trying to protect his mother. People only saw a problem side of him which skewed their attitude towards him. 

00:10:25
Visible problems and Invisible efforts Skew Adult-child interactions 

00:10:25
IS RESPONDING TO VISIBLE PROBLEM BEHAVIORS, THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF HELPING CHILDREN? From a neurobiology perspective, it is questionable that responding to problems alone will be effective since it often reinforces negative emotions We need to reinforce skills! 

00:10:25
NEGATIVE EMOTIONS HAVE A MORE POWERFUL HOLD ON THE BRAIN, AND THOUGHTS. GOOD INTENTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH. 

00:10:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN One can wonder if the visible problem behavior is the most effective way of helping children. Well, most of the time educators do not have a choice. They have to ensure safety. But, how they do it is important. Also, from a neurobiology perspective, it is questionable that responding to the problem alone, whether with consequences or lectures, will be very effective since it often reinforces negative emotions which the child is already struggling to manage. What we need is to reinforce skills. 

00:11:15
BRAIN WIRING FOR SKILLS & PROBLEMS CO-EXIST! Children usually contain some of the problem ideas that cross their minds 

00:11:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN This brings me to my second point. Brain wiring for skills and problems actually coexists in the brain. Children usually contain some of the problem ideas that cross their minds. As you can see in this cartoon, the older boy was tempted to say many mean words, but he was able to contain four of them and only shout one. 

00:11:45
You’re stupid. 

00:11:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Of course, this is the only one that we see which results in adults giving a lot of attention to outward problems rather than inner skills. Yet, the inner skills are there. They are setting limits. They are preventing a worse scenario. It's just that they are not as strong as the problem neural network, which is almost like a highway in the brain. A highway that is stronger, faster and longer. 

00:12:20
THE WIRING FOR PROBLEM RESPONSE CAN BE STRONGER, FASTER, LAST LONGER 

00:12:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The wiring for the emerging skills doesn't receive attention, repetition and emotional strengthening like problems do. The wiring for the emerging skills is often not strong enough to dominate systematically. And that is true for all children, whether they struggle with a problem or not. The wiring of all children's social skills would benefit immensely from adult support. This is especially true since important skills often happened randomly without awareness, conscious choice or complete control. One way to remember this last idea is to remember attempts at solving the Rubik's cube. Imagined that the Rubik's cube is like a problem, and you are trying to fix it. 

00:13:20
[sil.] 

00:13:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So, you've managed to solve a Rubik's cube or part of it. Would you be able to repeat it? Would you be able to teach a friend how to do it? Probably not, unless you had clearly noticed the strategies which helped you to solve this issue. We cannot repeat a skill unless we have clearly articulated how we accomplished this. You cannot become a master at something unless you are clear at what you're practicing. In the same way, children cannot develop a potential that they don't know they have. This is especially true with children because of the slower development of the frontal lobe which is the thinking part of the brain. And this brings me to my next point. 

00:14:30
THOUGHT PROCESS & SYNAPTIC DENSITY 

00:14:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Thought process and synaptic density. You have here a photo of the brain cells in the thinking part of children's brain. As you can tell, at first there are very few brain cells. A newborn is unable to mentally solve a problem. Between six and nine years old, humans reach their maximum number of brain cells and there maximum number of neural connections. Their minds are a firework of interconnected creative ideas. During adolescence, the brain will prune neural networks that are seldom used to gain speed. An example of that is children who learn to play the piano when they are young and then stop practicing when they are teenagers. Their brain will simply prune those unused networks. 

00:15:30
Thinking then can be metaphorically seen as going through a maze 

00:15:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN This means that children's problem-solving thoughts can metaphorically be seen as going through a maze where the six to ten-year-old child is most likely to get lost in making choices and overwhelmed emotionally by all the possible responses that come to his or her mind. In contrast, the adolescent may have less creative and out to there ideas, but his or her response will be more set, habitual and faster. In this mental maze, some of children's ideas are helpful and others are not. We can help children sort out and organize all the ideas bubbling in their brains. We can help them develop a constructive neural path in the maze of their mind. 

00:16:25
The issue is As caring adults, we become engrossed with wanting to teach skills, that we forget to look at what's already inside… 

00:16:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The main obstacle to this is that as caring adults we can often become so engrossed with wanting to teach skills that we forget to look at what's already inside. 

00:16:40
INTELLECTUAL VERSUS EMOTIONAL The brain processes emotional information differently than intellectual material 

00:16:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN This brings me t0 my last theoretical point. The brain processes emotional information differently than intellectual material. As you can see here, well intended adults are often tempted to tell kids what they should do or what they should have done. But this intellectual information is stored in a different part of the brain. The part of the brain that is directly involved in controlling the emotional dynamite, represented here by the fire truck, is not nourished in these conversations, especially if the child has negative emotions. How can our work with children then really help and influence their choice during challenging social interactions? A metaphor I like to use is how we would teach swimming. Interestingly, swimming and handling upsetting social interaction have a lot in common because of their similar impact on the body and the brain. 

00:17:50
PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS INVOLVED IN DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES Bodily changes Solving a conflict Swimming Listening Heart rate accelerated X X - Breathing pace increased X X - Bloodflow directed to limbs X X - Brain focused on sensorial info & "survival" X X - Emotional brain involvement X X Sometimes Highly experiential X X Sometimes 

00:17:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN If we compare the physiological reactions involved in these different activities, you can see that solving a conflict and swimming have similar effects on the body. They both are associated with an accelerated heart rate, breathing pace, blood flow in the limbs, and the brain focuses on survival. There's also an involvement in the emotional brain if children are nervous. And both of these are highly experiential because children are actively doing something. Listening, on the other hand, tends to be a bit more passive. Children may feel bored, misunderstood, disconnected or powerless. 

00:18:40
WE WOULDN'T THINK OF TEACHING HOW TO SWIM IN A LESSON FORMAT… 

00:18:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN We wouldn't think of teaching how to swim in a lesson format. Just as it is more effective to learn about swimming in the water, it is more effective to develop social and emotional skills within children's experiences of events. 

00:18:55
If an image is worth a 1,000 words, and experiences worth 1,000 lessons. 

00:18:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN If an image is worth a thousand words, an experience is worth a thousand lessons. This is a shift in perspective from trying to put skills in children's brain to boosting what's already there. This shift in perspective is exciting as it allows us to boost or optimize many emerging skills which are already partially working for the child and develop many crucial aspects of social intelligence. 

00:19:30
Children become with the practice to be 

00:19:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Children become who they practice to be. 

00:19:35
Let’s allow them to practice and expand on their own clever problem solving skills. Let’s optimize those neural networks already existing in their brains in which are often partially successful at solving issues skillfully 

00:19:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Let's allow them to practice and expand on their own clever problem-solving skills. Let's optimize those neural networks already existing in their brains and which are often partially successful at solving issues skillfully. How can we do that? 

00:20:00
HOW CAN WE DO THAT? 

00:20:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Well, there's a few ways to do that. We can have a skill focused one on one conversation. Narrative therapy is helpful. Or we can have groups and classrooms engage in exciting activities such as the brain powers project. 

00:20:15
THE BRAIN POWERS PROJECT! 

00:20:15
Students' Self Observation of Successes 

00:20:15
THE BRAIN POWERS PROJECT Create a structured stories of effort. Increased children's awareness of what they can do, what to they have done, & can repeat more often. It uses the brain's key encoders of the emotions, attention and repetition 

00:20:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The brain powers project creates a structured space for stories of effort to be expressed, shared, reflected on, reviewed and further articulated in the brain. The brain powers project increases children's' awareness of what they can do, what they have done, and can easily repeat more richly and more often. It uses key brain encoders such as emotions, attention and repetition to boost children's best social and emotional skills. It uses a combination of playful activities, sharing of personal stories and serious conversations, making it interesting to participate in the process. The logic behind it is simple. If we highlight certain themes kids are already randomly using, and if we facilitate mental classification and prioritizing, kids will recall these themes quicker, and they will use them more readily. 

00:21:25
PATRICIA BELVEL I think it's critical to use children's own issues to problem solve because they have meaning to them, they are real, they fit in with all of the research on developmental learning for children. That it's at their level, and they experienced it. They can then rationally think about it. 

00:21:50
DEVELOPING A MENTAL GPS TO NAVIGATE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS Intentional response Empathy Self-awareness Thinking ahead Mindfulness 

00:21:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Essentially, children develop a mental GPS to navigate potential conflicts. They develop the following categories of thoughts: intentional response, empathy, self-awareness, thinking ahead and mindfulness. I will now describe the boosting of each of these skills and to show footage of live recording with the second grade and a fourth-grade classroom. These excerpts show children as they are in real life. There was no rehearsal, no script and no staging. So what you will see is imperfect, but it reflects the natural unfolding that takes place during the activities. 

00:22:40
INTENTIONAL RESPONSE Based on research suggesting that goal setting has a powerful impact on people's choices, decisions, and performances in a variety of settings. In the B.P. project, children are encouraged to notice when and how they "keep problems small". This is playfully labeled "The Shrinking power" 

00:22:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Intentional response. This is based on research suggesting that goal setting has a powerful impact on people's choices, decisions and performance in a variety of settings. In the brain powers project, children are encouraged to notice when and how they keep problems small. This is playfully labeled the shrinking power as you will see in the following clip. Okay, but this person got upset at her dad for getting a new job because it meant he had to go away every week. Now would you miss your parent if they had to be gone? Raise your hand if you'd miss your parent if they would be gone every week. Okay, bring your hands down. Okay. And, so this person had a lot of upset feelings, but with her double vision power to see invisibles, she realized that her dad had to earn money for their family to continue to live. So, she decided to shrink the problem in a very clever way. Would you have any guess in how you would shrink that problem? yes? 

00:24:00
STUDENT Maybe if I not thinking about it. Thinking about how much money he'll get or something like that. 

00:24:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So, not thinking about it, just thinking about the advantages of the situation. Yes? 

00:24:15
STUDENT Uh, just like, like, trying to think that he, he's just going to be home late, and he has to leave early. So, he still home, but he's just , you can't see him. 

00:24:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah, so it's a kind of trick your mind sort of, that he's still home. Uh-huh. 

00:24:35
STUDENT Because my dad goes to Indonesia. 

00:24:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ah, so you have that situation too, where your dad goes away. So tricking your mind to pretend that he's going to be home late or that he's here. It's just that you can't see him right now. Yes. 

00:24:45
STUDENT Uh, you could like talk on the phone with him. 

00:24:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. You could talk on the phone with them too. Yeah, so you don't miss them as much. Yes. 

00:24:55
STUDENT I'm just staying with my mom for the moment (inaudible) her, uh, like a work thing. So what I did is that I thought, "Oh, she's in, she, she's in a place that she likes to go to and is having a good time." 

00:25:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So imagining that it's good. See you imagine that it was a good place for your mom to be. So thinking about the advantages for the other person. Yes, those are wonderful strategies. So, this person decided to shrink the problem by spending more time with him when he was home. in that way that, that meant that , uh, she was spending an equal amount of time in the end by spending more time when he was there. 

00:25:45
INTENTIONAL RESPONSES The "Choice brain", (neocortex) versus their "Lion brain" (limbic system). Young children really latch onto that concept as they suddenly have a language to talk about what happens inside without feeling blamed, ashamed or that something is wrong with them. 

00:25:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN With younger children, I have developed a flood of activities which highlight their use of the choice brain, the Neo cortex, versus their lion brain, the limbic system. Young children really latch onto that concept as they suddenly have a language to talk about what happens inside without feeling blamed, ashamed or that something is wrong with them. Most people who experienced frustration are actually tempted to do things against their better judgment, and this language allows them to freely examine their thoughts. All right. Hello, everyone. Did you have a fun recess? 

00:26:30
STUDENTS Yes. 

00:26:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah, that's wonderful. Okay, how many of you can tell me what the choice brain is? Raise your hand if you can tell me what the choice brain is. Yes? 

00:26:45
STUDENT it's where you make the choices, and, and, it, if you like, you're in the lion brain, then you choose, sometimes people change to the choice brain and they just, yeah. 

00:26:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay, So your choice brain helps you make good choices. Yes, yes. 

00:27:00
STUDENT In the choice brain also helps you make choices to decide whether to listen to the lion brain or the choice brain. 

00:27:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ah, yes. Your choice brain helps you to decide if you're going to listen to the lion brain. And what is the lion brain? 

00:27:15
STUDENT Of the lion brain, like when somebody hits you or hurts you or anything like that, the lion brain just wants you to jump back at them and hurt them. 

00:27:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yes, the lion brain roars inside of you because it wants to protect you, and it wants you to get back at them. What else does the lion brain once you to do? Or wants kids to do? 

00:27:40
STUDENT It wants you to growl at them or hit them or be mean. 

00:27:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah, the lion brain... 

00:27:45
STUDENT And if someone says stop the lion brain will make you and not stop and just keep on doing it. 

00:27:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So the lion brain makes you keep on wanting to do it and did not stop. Yes, yes. 

00:27:55
STUDENT It's helpful to kids to learn about the choice brain because otherwise they wouldn't solve problems. And when they make it to adult land, they wouldn't have enough power. And they wouldn't have enough power to become the person that you would be if you don't have tp trust your choice brain. 

00:28:15
STUDENT It would be good for kids to know about the choice brain, because then that they actually can make better choices then they would if they, they would make better choices because they know about the choice brain, and they really know about it. 

00:28:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN All right. So, how many of you have used your choice brain this past week. Raise your hand if you've used it. Just if you used it. You don't have to share the story, but if you've used your choice brain. Okay. Bring your hands down. So, how many of you would like to share a story of using your choice brain? Yes. 

00:28:50
STUDENT Uh, when me and my friend were playing soccer, somebody said the goals were unfair, but when other kids keep on telling them... 

00:29:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yes. Okay, the other person didn't understand. And your choice brain helped you explain so that the person could better understand. Yeah? Okay, wonderful. Any other story of using their choice brain? Yes. 

00:29:15
STUDENT I was playing with Legos, and then someone else, they kept on giving my friend better things, and they gave me bad stuff. And so I just told, and the teacher said, "If they do it again, then I will come." And then, and then he, he gave both of us the good things. 

00:29:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ah, okay. And what did you lion brain want you to do in that situation? 

00:29:35
STUDENT To break there, to break their creation. 

00:29:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Did you hear that? How many of you sometimes, the lion brain makes you want to break something? Raise your hand if the lion brain makes you want to break something, because it does that a lot. Yeah. Bring your hands down. So, the lion brain made you want to break his Legos, but instead you listened to your choice brain. And your choice brain told you to go talk to the teacher? 

00:30:00
STUDENT Yeah. 

00:30:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Were you happy that your choice brain helped you talk to the teacher? 

00:30:05
STUDENT Yeah. 

00:30:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah, cuz what happens afterwards? It sounds like you all got pieces that were more equal. 

00:30:10
STUDENT No, that were good. 

00:30:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN That were good. Pieces that were good. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Do you have a story of using your choice brain? 

00:30:15
STUDENT My brother was messing up my Legos. He was, he was leaving them lost. And then, and then that made me say, and then he, I think he was going to break it. And then that made me want to break his x-wing. And then I just did not want to get in trouble, so I just kept it fixed. 

00:30:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So your lion brain wanted you to break his Legos, but instead you listened to your choice brain, and you kept it fixed. What is it that, that helped you listen to your choice brain? What did you tell yourself? 

00:30:45
STUDENT Didn't want to get in trouble. If, if no one, because I thought I would be grounded. 

00:30:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you didn't want to get in trouble. You didn't want to be grounded. And anything else that your choice brain helped you remember? 

00:31:00
STUDENT I think, I don't remember. 

00:31:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay, so those are the main things that your choice brain said. Yes? Thank you. 

00:31:05
Erika George, Teacher Washington Open 

00:31:05
ERIKA GEORGE Uh, I think one of the good things about the kids having an opportunity to share is that when they share as a group they realize that they have common stories, and that also helps them feel better about their situation. So, uh, they realize they're not the only one that has the feelings that they are happening. And that's helpful as a group. And they get more comparable talking about their stories and issues that come up for them. So then, there's kind of a community for, we talk about how were feeling. They got, as we were doing more and more of these activities in our classroom, the kids got more and more comfortable with talking about their feelings. So it's kind of created that environment for them. The more kids told stories and the more kids of the group told stories, it became kind of this accepted thing. Like, oh yeah, we all do this, and we all feel these ways. And we have the power to make this decision. And as that happened, uh, their ability to use their choice brain in situations at home or on the playground or in the classroom grew. 

00:32:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So the lion brain can make someone say a mean word. It can be hurtful. 

00:32:10
STUDENT On purpose. 

00:32:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN On purpose, yes. So the lion brain can make people attack. Yes. So the choice brain helps you think about things, so that you'll be able to make choices that are not so hurtful. And that would be better for you. And the lion brain is there to protect you, so it's still really useful. Yeah? Because, what happens if you were to walk into a jungle and a crocodile was to attack you? Would your lion brain be, your lion brain would be helpful, wouldn't it? Yeah. 

00:32:40
STUDENT You could say bad words. That wouldn't even work a bit. 

00:32:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. 

00:32:45
STUDENT Why is it helpful to, for kids to see their choice brain? It's because that whenever they are in a fight or something, they just get a little angry because that person might be being mean to somebody. But, if you're using your choice brain, that means then you'll be a little bit, it'll be a little bit better for you to use your choice brain because you'll make the right choices. 

00:33:10
ERIKA GEORGE The group that we have is, is a pretty young group with a lot of energy and pretty impulsive. And, with that all in play, there's a lot of bumping into each other and things that happened where there's upsets. So, the gift of the choice brain and the lion brain just helps separate the child from the action. So they understand that they have the power of choice, but everyone has that lion choice in their brain and the opportunity to know that and then know that they can make a different choice with their choice brain. That they have his the power to go there. So, having those words, it was really easy as time went on to just say that in the class. Oh , use your choice brain. What could you do? Oh, that sounds like the lion brain. What else could you do? 

00:33:55
EMPATHY (DOUBLE-VISION) Empathy is optimized by encouraging children to observe others and speculate on the possible contributors to another's behavior. This is playfully labeled the Double Vision Power as it involves children seeing both Visible + Invisible information about others. 

00:33:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN I will now move to this skill of empathy. Empathy is optimized by encouraging children to observe others and speculate on the possible contributors to another's behavior. This is playfully labeled the Double Vision Power as it involves children seeing both the visible about a person and indivisible information about others. More specifically, this means inviting children to notice the facial expression that we can see on the face of their peers and also to speculate on what might have happened before to the person which could be contributing to the current problem. I have a trick question now. Who remembers what invisibles are? Raise your hand if you remember what they are. Oh my gosh. So many of you remember. Wonderful. Let's see. Who didn't get a chance to speak yet? Yes? 

00:35:00
STUDENT It's kind of like if they got mad at you, then something else is hiding that, that they might be upset. 

00:35:05
STUDENT Or hurt. 

00:35:05
STUDENT They might get, they might have been in a bad mood because something happened before. 

00:35:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So the invisibles are things that that happened before to that other person, and we can't see it. But, we can guess that something happened before. Yes, who else wants to add something to that? Yes. 

00:35:25
STUDENT Uh, the invisibles are like, uh, like something when something's, like if somebody hurts you, something, there's something invisible that only they can see inside of them. 

00:35:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So sometimes there's things that happen with other people that only them know about it. Yeah, absolutely. So, your choice brain helped you turn back the score, make a decision to turn back the score so that it wouldn't lead to a fight with your friend. 

00:36:00
STUDENT Yeah. 

00:36:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And what did your lion brain wants you to do? 

00:36:00
STUDENT My lion brain wanted me to, uh, lower her points and higher mine. 

00:36:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So your lion brain just wanted to higher your points and wanted you to win. And you were able to use your choice brain to make it fair for your friend too. Thank you for sharing. Yes. Another story. 

00:36:25
STUDENT One time I was playing with my friend, and she, and she was mad. And then she kicked me on the head. And then I wanted to kick her back, but I just went to the office with my other friend. 

00:36:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ah, so, so one time you got kicked in the face, and your lion brain wanted you to kick her back. But instead, you made a decision to just go to your, to the office. Yeah, and was that a choice brain decision to just go to the office? How did your choice brain help you make that decision? What were you telling you to help you make that decision? 

00:37:05
STUDENT I didn't want to get in trouble. 

00:37:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN You didn't want to get in trouble. Okay. Could you see some invisibles about your friend? 

00:37:10
STUDENT She was mad. 

00:37:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN She was mad too, so she had her lion brain really activated. Yeah? Okay. 

00:37:15
LORI KING I know that Marie-Nathalie's in some of these activities and some of the, uh, teachers use what's called invisibles. It's these non-visible, uh, problems that students have or thinking that they have that causes them to react or behave in a certain way, and they're not always cognizant of what they are. And Marie-Nathalie helps them bring those to light and sort of brings those up so that kids can realize that some of the thinking that's happening that's invisible is contributing to some of the problems. And by reflecting and understanding some of their thoughts, they can then redirect those thoughts. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:05
4th Grade's Understanding of Invisibles 

00:38:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Now, we're going to look at your stories, but I wonder if any of you can explain what double vision is? Let's see. Who didn't get a chance yet? Yes. 

00:38:20
STUDENT Uh, it's when you can see the other person's thoughts. It helps you, like, understand if they are in a bad mood or something like that. 

00:38:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So, when you can guess another person's thoughts, yeah. Who wants to add to that? Yes? 

00:38:35
STUDENT The visible or the invisible. 

00:38:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So, it's when somebody can think about the visible information and the invisible information. Who can say what invisible and visible is? Let's see. Yes? 

00:38:45
STUDENT Invisible. What, me? 

00:38:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:38:50
STUDENT Uh, invisible is when, like, it's, uh, like, if you didn't get enough sleep, and, they are being mean to you. Then, the invisible is he didn't get enough sleep. So he's cranky. But, the visible, if you like got beat up, and there is like scratches on his face. That's like of the visible. 

00:39:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So, the visibles are things you can see about another person, that you can pay attention to. And the invisibles are things that we don't see, but they still have a big impact on how people are going to treat us or what people are going to do. Yes. Anybody wants to add anything to that? Yes. 

00:39:25
STUDENT So simply, like, uh, Wil said, it is basically when somebody is like hurt or mad or something happen to them, they usually do stuff bad to you. And then that's their invisible. Like, oh, there'd dog died so they are, like, all cranky and mad and sad. So, they have to get it out someway, so they get it out by saying something mean. 

00:39:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So when, when somebody has hurt feelings inside that we can't see because we can't see the insides of someone. When somebody has hurt feelings inside that are invisible, then it may get them to be cranky. So if we are able to see and think about their invisibles, then we are going to respond differently to them, right. What might we do differently when we are facing somebody who is kind of cranky and who might have hurt feelings inside? 

00:40:15
STUDENT Well, well, we actually understand that they they're upset. So we know that, we know that it's still not right, but we know that they were just upset. So, it's, it's nothing personal. 

00:40:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So we know that it's nothing personal. That it's just because they had some upset feelings inside. So it doesn't make what they did right, but it makes it easier for us to handle it. Yeah. Okay, wonderful. 

00:40:45
Drawing of students' success story, previously screened for appropriateness" 

00:40:45
SHERRY ERNST I think like any of us, looking at our successes makes, makes them more, uh, useful and available then if we just hear the abstract, and we don't look at what actually happened. It also makes it easier to learn because you are relating it right to your life and what's happening with you at the time. 

00:41:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Let's see. Should we do our song? 

00:41:10
STUDENTS Yeah. 

00:41:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Are you ready? 

00:41:15
STUDENTS Yeah. 

00:41:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN One, two, three. 

00:41:20
STUDENT Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Ta-ta-ta-ta. Ta-da-da. Ta-da-da. Ta-da-da. Okay. 

00:41:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Let's see. I have a story here with somebody whose friend said something about him that he didn't like. Boy, how many of you have had that happen to you before? Oh, yeah. That's, that's happened, that happens very often. Okay, bring your hands down. Okay, so the upset feelings made him tempted to hit his friend. But, he didn't. With his double vision power to see invisibles, he realized that his friend was having a bad day. What might be some other invisibles that some of your friends might have that may contribute to them saying something not so nice? 

00:42:10
STUDENT Uh, like, he didn't eat at all. 

00:42:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So maybe it's just before lunch, and he's starving. Yes. 

00:42:20
STUDENT Not much sleep. 

00:42:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Not much sleep. Yes. 

00:42:20
STUDENT Their pet attacked them. 

00:42:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN No what? 

00:42:25
STUDENT With their pets attacked them. 

00:42:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Their pets attack to them. Yeah, that can definitely happen. What may be some other invisibles? Yes? 

00:42:30
STUDENT Someone in their family, in their family died. 

00:42:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Someone in their family died. Yeah. All sorts of things could have happened. Yeah. Okay. So, this person decided to shrink the problem by ignoring it. All right. Can anybody guess who that is? Ryan. Okay, Ryan let me interview you about this. Let's do your brain. Okay. So you... The double vision power really makes sense to children, and many of them report using the double vision power many years after the project is over. All right, and you get to wear my superduper T-shirt, "Rain or shine, I choose to be me". Okay. And of the double vision glasses. And the anchor. Do you want the special hat that goes with this? All right. Should we put this special hat on her? 

00:43:30
STUDENTS Yeah. 

00:43:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN All right. Here we go. It's that peaceful hat. Okay. Very nice. Oops. Let's turn it sideways. There we go. Is that good? Okay. And, I'm going to pretend to be the upset feeling. Should I wear my dark glasses? 

00:43:50
STUDENTS Yeah. 

00:43:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And then, I have my little pen, because you are going to shrink me so that I am so small that you are controlling your brain. Are we ready? So, we need is somebody to stand up, somebody who may not have had a chance yet, to stand up and pretend to be a father, and to just do a "blah-blah-blah". Choose somebody to stand up and pretend to be your father. For one second, and then sit down. 

00:44:15
STUDENT Lydia. 

00:44:15
LYDIA Blah-blah-blah. 

00:44:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay, thank you. All right. Oh, I'm so upset. I feel like punching him. 

00:44:30
STUDENT That's fine. He needs money for the family so we can go on vacations and stuff. 

00:44:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN No, kick him, kick him. 

00:44:35
STUDENT No, we can spend more time together. 

00:44:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Oh, he just doesn't want to be with you. That's probably the reason. 

00:44:45
STUDENT We can go on walks together. 

00:44:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN No, he, he just doesn't want to spend time with you. Be mad. Be mad. 

00:44:55
STUDENT Go on vacation. 

00:44:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Can you listen to me? I said be mad, be mad. 

00:45:00
STUDENT Don't listen to that. 

00:45:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN All right, let's give them a hand. 

00:45:05
IDENTITY & SELF-AWARENESS Children are better able to resist peer pressure and use their judgment when they are clear about the kind of person they prefer to be 

00:45:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Now I'd like to talk about identity and self-awareness. Children are better able to resist peer pressure and use their judgment when they are clearer about the kind of person they prefer to be. Yeah, absolutely. Who is the most powerful, the person who's not able to control their anger and who's yelling and shouting and kicking or the person who's able to stay the kind of person they want to be and contain their anger? Raise your hand if you think it's the person who contains their anger that's the most powerful. Raise your hand. The person who contains their anger. Perfect. Bring your hands down. Thank you. Absolutely. We are a lot more powerful when we have the courage to stick to the kind of person we want to be. Wonderful. Children, often helped by their classmates, often start thinking more and more about the kind of person they want to be, especially in the upper grades. 

00:46:00
ANCHORING Children are encouraged to articulate the kind of person they prefer to be in many situations. This is playfully labeled the "Anchoring power" and helps people make quicker and wiser choices in dire situations. 

00:46:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Labeling one's identity and becoming increasingly aware of the kind of person they want to be, has been playfully labeled anchoring. And it helps children make quicker and wiser choices in dire situations. Do you want to do a skit about that? 

00:46:20
STUDENT Uh, okay. 

00:46:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So choose one person to be your body. 

00:46:25
STUDENT Uh, Kaden. 

00:46:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Come on off. So, you will be the brain, okay. And, do you want to take your hat off? Rain or shine, if I choose to be me. Okay. And, the double vision glasses and the anchor. Let's see. We're going to take the rope off the anchor. There you go. You anchored yourself. Perfect. Let's see. Should I wear my dark glasses? 

00:47:00
STUDENTS Yeah. 

00:47:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. All right. Okay. Now, we are going to need somebody to pretend something mean, say "blah-blah-blah" or something. 

00:47:15
STUDENT Uh, Jessica. 

00:47:15
JESSICA Blah blah, blah-blah-blah. 

00:47:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Oh. I feel like screaming. 

00:47:25
STUDENT It's okay. You just have to, uh, think that he's having a bad day. He's just having a bad day because his parents yell at him. Just think about that. 

00:47:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN No, I'm your anger. I want you to punch at him. I want you to scream. 

00:47:40
STUDENT Ignore, ignore it, ignore it. Just think of yourself. 

00:47:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN No, he's just trying to get in the way of what you want to do. Get mad at him. 

00:47:45
STUDENT Just be yourself. Don't think of anything else. Think what you think you are. 

00:47:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN All right. Let's give them a hand. All right. 

00:47:55
THINKING AHEAD (FORESIGHT) Thinking about consequences is a challenging task for children because of the slower frontal lobe development. Yet, they can do it if we help them develop this habit of the mind during positive notions. Is most important about it is, is that like how you think ahead Yet, they can do it if we help them develop this habit of the mind during positive emotions. 

00:47:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Moving along to the next brain power which is called foresight. Foresight is actually about thinking ahead. Adults are often pulling their hair out wondering, "What was he thinking?" or telling children, "Can you think about the consequences before acting?" Thinking about consequences is a challenging task for children because of the slower frontal lobe development. Yet, they can do it if we help them develop this habit of the mind during positive emotion when their brain is functioning at its best and able to make complex connections. It encourged children to pay attention to crossroad, and think about where each one of their choices might take them next. 

00:48:55
STUDENT The brain power foresight? Well, what I think is most important about it is, uh, that, like, how you think ahead is like best. Like, if you don't want to get in trouble, then you shouldn't do it. And, uh, but if you want to have like fun and do something else that's better than just getting in trouble, you can just say, "I just don't want to do that" and stuff like that. 

00:49:25
INTEGRATION All of these brain powers benefit from being integrated into a mental GPS organizing the different themes that can help them out in decision making. I often use the metaphor of a pilot consulting his or her instruments. 

00:49:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN All of these brain powers really benefit from being integrated. They become integrated into a mental GPS, organizing the different themes that can help them out in the decision making process. I often like to use the metaphor of a pilot consulting his or her instruments to drive the plane safely in a direction that he or she chooses. Okay, so these fifth graders, did you know them? 

00:49:55
STUDENT Yeah. 

00:49:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:49:55
STUDENT They're like always thinking of something to do. 

00:50:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ah, so it was not the first time that happened? 

00:50:00
STUDENT Yeah, it's like their daily thing. 

00:50:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ah. So, does that make the upset feelings... 

00:50:05
STUDENT What? 

00:50:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Does that make the upset feelings bigger and bigger and bigger? In some ways, huh? Yeah. Okay. 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Because then the problem gets bigger. 

00:50:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And what would have happened if you had yelled at them? 

00:50:15
STUDENT Uh, well, they probably still would have gotten the court, and I would have gotten in trouble. Not the court, the field. 

00:50:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So, if you had yelled at them, you would have gotten in trouble, and you still wouldn't have gotten the field. 

00:50:30
STUDENT And I might have hurt their feelings. 

00:50:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. You might have hurt their feelings. And you would have lost the field for good, it sounds like, that day. For sure. Yeah. Okay. And, how would your day have been transformed by this? What would have happened the rest of your day? 

00:50:50
STUDENT Uh, I probably would have been like all mad because that I lost the field and that. And, uh, I, I wouldn't have had a good day because I was so mad about the thing. 

00:51:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you would have been mad, and then when you had come back to class, you might still be mad? Yeah. And so then you listened with mad feelings, and then the mad feelings can get really sticky, huh? They kind of stick onto us for a long time. 

00:51:15
STUDENT I might have not noticed it. Like, accidentally, like, uh, took it out on one of my friends or something. 

00:51:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. You could have taken it out on some of your friends. Yeah, yeah. Mad feelings tend to grow. They, they jump on all sorts of feelings, and then there's more and more people involved. Yeah. Okay. But, you didn't do any of that. Sounds like you used your instruments. What were you able to see in terms of, uh, double vision? Were you able to see some of their invisibles? 

00:51:45
STUDENT Well, it did look like, like they kind of had a gloomy face probably because, like, they had, like a math test or something. 

00:51:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So, you noticed the visible, their gloomy face. 

00:52:00
STUDENT Yeah. 

00:52:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN A gloomy face. And then did you notice any invisible, or could you guess some invisible? So, when you said the math test, that would be one invisible. 

00:52:10
STUDENT Well, they, they, they were kind of fighting among, among each other. So, maybe they, like, all gone, maybe like that group got in trouble by the teacher or something. 

00:52:20
Research shows that kids can listen well if they are playing with 

00:52:20
their hands so they are not restricted unless necessary. 

00:52:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So, so, maybe they had a math test or maybe had trouble with the teacher before. Okay. So, you were able to see visible gloomy face and invisible trouble with the teacher before and fighting amongst each other. And what kind of person did you become in making that choice? 

00:52:40
STUDENT Uh, I become a person that doesn't have anger management problems. 

00:52:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Somebody that's able to control their anger. 

00:52:50
STUDENT Yeah. 

00:52:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? And what else? 

00:52:50
STUDENT Uh, I'm, I'm a person that can see, that has the double vision. 

00:52:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN A person that has double vision power. Yeah. 

00:53:00
STUDENT And maybe somebody that, like, uh, maybe like that doesn't, uh, be mean to kids just because they're being mean to him. 

00:53:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. Somebody that doesn't just be mean to others because they're mean to you. Yeah. Somebody who doesn't retaliate. Yes. And, then you have here on your slip that at that time you felt like you became a kind and understanding and respectful person. Yeah. Okay. So, that too. And, how did that change your day, that you were able to see the future here of the yelling volcano and trouble and mad feelings? 

00:53:45
STUDENT Well, uh, most of the day I felt pretty good about what I did. 

00:53:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:53:50
STUDENT It was like being... 

00:53:55
[sil.] 

00:53:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Good. And you had the field. Okay. And, would say that your intention was to kind of keep the problems small? Or would you say differently? 

00:54:35
STUDENT Uh, probably to keep it small because it probably would have, we probably would have had to like put him on yard duty. And then that would take a long time to solve the problem. And then I wouldn't have any time to play at all. 

00:54:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Absolutely. Did anybody else notice that? Like, if you don't solve the problem yourself, and you kind of go to yard duties or you let the mad feelings take over, then it takes a lot more time. Yeah. Bring your hands down. Okay, all right. So, choose four people to become your instruments and come on up. Your pilot equipment. There's no anger person here. There's double, double vision. There's intention to keep problems small. Point down. And then you're each gonna have. So, who is foresight? You're gonna hold this. Can you hold it so we see it, people see it? All right. where's anchoring? There you go. You can hold this. Oops, sorry. In front of you. Hold, hold it in front of you. And double vision, you can hold that with your two hands in front of you. All right. You can sit down. And where's our intention. All right. On each side of the plane. You can stand up. You can stand up. Stand up. Yeah. And then intention, can you come closer? Why don't you come closer and turn around. Yeah. Turn around. No, no, the other way. Sorry. And then scoot back. Okay. All right. We're gonna start with the walkie-talkie. Here's the walkie-talkie for the pilot. And, we're gonna start with intentions. And we're gonna need a fifth grader to stand up and say, "I got the field" or something like that. 

00:56:05
STUDENT Uh, Sierra. 

00:56:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you hold it so we can see it? Okay. And then, remember you start with intention, and then you pass the walkie-talkie quickly to double vision, then anchoring and then foresight. All right. And then, Wil, you call your brain powers. All right? One, two, three. Where's our fifth grader? 

00:56:25
STUDENT A-ha. I got the field, and you didn't. 

00:56:30
WIL Intention, what do you see? 

00:56:35
STUDENT That you've got to let it go, bro. 

00:56:40
WIL Double vision. 

00:56:45
STUDENT I'm having a bad day. 

00:56:50
WIL Uh, Anchoring power. What could I do? 

00:56:55
STUDENT You should be a nice person, and just take the smaller field, cuz that's better than no field. 

00:57:05
WIL Okay. Foresight, what do I say. 

00:57:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Foresight, what do I do? 

00:57:10
WIL Foresight, what do I do? 

00:57:15
STUDENT Be a good person, or else you'll have a cloudy day. 

00:57:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN All right, let's give them a hand. Another way of facilitating the intergration of all these skills is when teachers ask students to reflect on the brain power activities afterwards. Children really like skits, especially in elementary school. In upper grades, the brains powers project is facilitated with more theoretical information on the brain and more self reflection in their journals. There are many brain powers and activities that can be explored with students depending on if the school wants a 4 week, a 16 week or a year long project. 

00:58:00
MINDFULNESS (THE PRACTICE OF PAYING QUIET ATTENTION) Scientific research has shown that entering the mental state of mindfulness actually changes some structures in the brain in a measurable way Even if this skill is practiced only for a limited amount of time. 

00:58:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The last brain power I will describe in this video is mindfulness. Mindfulness is about focusing our mind, about noticing one's experience of our body or thoughts or surroundings, for example. Mindfulness has been very emphasized recently in neurobiology because of its effects on the brain. Scientific research has shown that entering the mental state of mindfulness actually changes some structures in the brain in a measurable way, even if this skill is practiced only for a limited amount of time. 

00:58:40
MINDFULNESS Helping children notice and experience the sensations around a calm body allows them to discover a mental state they may have never dwelled in before Noticing it allows repeating it. 

00:58:40
Speed of facilitation is slightly slower than students' energy level 

00:58:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Mindfulness helps children notice and experience the sensations around a calm body, which allows them to discover a mental state that some may have never dwelled in before. Noticing it allows repeating it. In this next classroom clip, you will see an example of facilitation of mindfulness with second graders. And, we're gonna start by taking a really slow and powerful tornado breath. And send it down one of our legs to chase the wiggles and the giggles. So, let's take a deep breath in. And send the tornado breath down one of the legs that you choose to clear out the giggles and the wiggles. And sometimes our breath is more powerful if we close our eyes. So, how about we all close our eyes so that we can really feel the air going through our nose and going all the way down to the end of the leg and the end of the foot. And checking if there's any wiggles and giggles that are hiding in our toes. And then you blow them out very slowly and silently. And then we're gonna take another deep breath and check what's in our arms. Let's see if there's any wiggles and giggles in our arms. So, slow, deep breath that goes down one of the arms of your choice. All the way to the tip of your fingers. Make sure you check every finger that there's no giggles and wiggles. Now that we've gotten rid of the giggles and the wiggles, let's take a deep breath to fill in our lung balloons very silently. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Fill your lung balloons very slowly. And then blow the air out. And then in your second breath see if you can figure out the color of your lung balloons today. You have to be very still and not move. Only your lung balloons getting bigger. Feel only your lung balloons getting bigger. And slowly blow the air out. And do that one more time to see if you can get your lung balloons to grow even bigger. Now, we're gonna pretend that we are pebbles in a river. So, we're not moving. Everything is perfectly still. Perfectly still. And if you close your eyes, and you feel yourself becoming a little heavier. Just feel your arms and your legs become a little heavier. Maybe even your head is a little heavier, and your body doesn't have to move at all, because you're a beautiful pebble at the bottom of a brook or river. And you might even feel a certain color. You might even feel a certain shape. And your breath moving in and out of your lungs is like the water flowing. You're not moving at all. Your eyes are closed, and you hear your breath, which is like the sound of this nice peaceful river flowing inside of you. Breathe deeply, and you feel like the air is almost like caressing your body, just like the water would gently be caressing your body if you were a pebble at the bottom of the river. Feel how heavy your body is, and the shape that you have. And there might be even different colors on your pebbles. Different colors for one part of you and other colors for another part of you. And feel how your breath is gently stroking your pebble body and how silent and peaceful it is. And bring your awareness to the fact that there's actually other pebbles around you who are also very still, very, very still. And who are beautiful and who form your community, who form the group of pebbles with which you spend your day. And they're all trying to be beautiful and be at their best and shining. We're gonna take one last minute to see how still and heavy your body will become as pebbles. Let's take three more deep breaths and see if we can be completely still, completely quiet and heavy pebbles. One. Two. Enjoy the heaviness of your arms and legs. And three, feel how peaceful your body has become. So calm and enjoy. Now I'm going to count backward from five to one, and then you can all open your eyes and come back peacefully to the room. Five, try to remember how it feels to have your body this way. Four, notice how your arms and legs are peaceful. Three, notice how silent and still your face feels. Two, notice how your heart may even be slower. And one, you can all open your eyes now and sit straight. All right. Can some of you describe your pebbles to me and how it was like to be a pebble? Yes? 

01:06:50
STUDENT I felt, I felt silly in my foot, and I can still feel it. And also, uh, I felt like I was in a little sea stars, when they're actually moving but you don't even see them. I felt like I was moving my head like a sea star. 

01:07:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. You felt like a sea star. That you were kind of heavy at the bottom in the water. 

01:07:10
STUDENT And, and I was kind of moving a little bit, but nobody saw me. 

01:07:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Aha. So, you were moving your head a little bit, but nobody could see it? 

01:07:20
STUDENT My lung balloons was a different shape too. It was a cat, and it was purple. 

01:07:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So, your lung balloons were a different shape. They were a cat and purple. Thank you for sharing. Teachers are often blown away by how still and peaceful the classroom can become for several minutes. 

01:07:40
ERIKA GEORGE So, in our classroom we had an opportunity to have lessons that involved mindfulness with our, uh, students. And, the group that I had the last couple of years, uh, came as a pretty young and impulsive, active crew. And, uh, the gift of spending some time each week on centering our bodies and our minds, uh, as a group was learning how to get calm. And that had a really big payoff over time. So, the kids learned that they had the ability to calm themselves. And I wish we had, possibly there are clips that you'll get to see, because there were times when a group that came with all this energy. When we would, uh, quiet our brains and, you know, go down through our arms and our legs and all of that, that the shift in and the energy from where we started at the beginning to the end, it was palpable. I mean, not just in their, their body motions, but just the energy in the room. And, uh, it, it kind of brought their hearts out. So, when they get calm, uh, all of that kind of, all over the place energy kind of settles. And then out comes a much stronger, uh, that connected piece that kept us kind of bonded together. So, that was one of the biggest benefits of having mindfulness in our classroom, I think. 

01:09:00
STUDENT I like the mindfulness because it was calming, not like usually on carpet. All the boys are like all crazy. But, it was really calm there. And I was thinking of pebble, when I was a pebble in the pond, lake. And, that I felt really relaxed. 

01:09:20
ERIKA GEORGE The more you can center yourself and have an awareness of your choices and who you are and your peers, the more you're able to do in your classwork, uh, with partners. And when you're playing and having fun and knowing to resolve things as they come up. So, I really really believe that, uh, it is worth every minute that you can spend. Because, the more the kids get used to it and are aware of it as, uh, a part of themselves, the more they're able to do things on their own, that they have this independently. They don't need us to support them. 

01:09:55
DEVELOPING A RICHER AWARENESS OF THEMSELVES In this process, children discover their own: problem solving style preferences for conflict minimizing interactions motivations to make certain choices. They develop a better emotional regulation system since we boost a neural network which is already active during conflicts. They discover that they are competent, resilient, flexible, kind and that they can solve problems. 

01:09:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The combination of these activities accomplishes a lot. Children develop a richer awareness of themselves because they discover their own problem solving style, their preferences for conflict minimizing interactions and their motivations to make certain choices. They develop a better emotional regulation system, since we boost a neural network which is already active during conflicts and has a direct impact on problem solving. They discover they they are competent, resilient, flexible, kind and that they can solve problems. All right. So, we're gonna stop now, but remember, yeah. Remember you can't control what happens outside of you. Your days are always gonna be full of surprises, but you can control what happens inside of you and the choices that you're gonna make afterwards. All right? So, give yourself a hand. 

01:11:00
DEVELOPING A RICHER VIEW OF THEIR PEERS... Students get to see others': -efforts, values, successes -struggles -gestures of kindness They become more likely to see them as: buddies! 

01:11:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN They also develop a richer view of their peers. Students get to see each other's efforts, values, successes, struggles, gestures of kindness. They become more likely to see them as buddies. Even if some have occasional problem habits. 

01:11:25
STUDENT Now I see, like, a lot of people in my class and other, and, uh, friends and third graders and first graders. I think they all are like, uh, like I'm starting to see them differently. Like, before they were all like arguing. But now I'm starting to see them as like more like a friendly person, people. 

01:11:45
Many educators appreciate the multiple impacts of optimizing children's own neural networks for skills through these activities as you will hear in the following comments...

MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Many people appreciate the multiple impacts of optimizing children's own neural networks for skills through these activities as you will hear in the following comments from educators and children. 

01:12:00
Sherry Ernst Teacher Washington Open 

01:12:00
SHERRY ERNST Yes, I'd love to talk about all the positive effects we saw with the brain powers project. Uh, the students loved being able to think of a way to shrink problems, especially ones that don't involve just going to an adult. They love knowing that there's something they can do when they're angry. Uh, they love knowing about other people and what they're thinking, having them develop double vision, what's going on with other people, I think helps the students develop empathy, for anyone they were having a problem with, whether it was at school or a sibling, anyone at home. The students also, uh, really like looking for other people doing these things, because they like to know what's going on, and that extended what they could learn from the project by seeing what the other students were able to do. They also like, uh, having, being able to think about what kind of person they want to be and how using these strategies will help them be the kind of person they want to be. It really inspires them to try the technique that they've been learning and use the understanding. 

01:13:05
STUDENT What I most like about the brain powers project is it helped, like, kids understand, like, when your friend is being mean to you or something. Instead of like breaking a friendship, you can, uh, understand why they're being sad, and you can help them. And, and, uh, nobody's feelings have to get hurt. 

01:13:30
STUDENT They discover what type of a person they are and who they can become. 

01:13:35
STUDENT What I liked the most about the brain project was that, uh, we get to learn more about how we, how to use the special powers that we have. And that we, cuz some kids don't know that we have this special power, and don't know how to use it. 

01:13:50
SHERRY ERNST I think they develop patience. I think they learn to calm themselves down. I think they learn to take time with their problems. I think they learn to take responsibility for their actions, and because they have a way to control their actions, then they're more ready to take responsibility for their actions. 

01:14:10
STUDENT I think the brain power project is really helpful to kids because they learn more about their brain, and it's, how it's easier for them to control themselves, like when they have, when they're angry at someone they know how to use double vision. 

01:14:25
STUDENT What I like most like about brain powers is that, uh, like a lot of people said. Uh, like it helps everyone else get like really calm. And then everyone can have fun. And then the more fun they have, like the more happier the life gets. 

01:14:45
SHERRY ERNST I think that the brain powers project would be a good program for any school, but particularly for a school that's dealing with bullying so that students can think about how they can react to bullying, how they can help cut it down and how other people are feeling when those things happen to them, which will help change their, change behavior. 

01:15:05
STUDENT I like the idea of keeping problems small, because, uh, when there's less problems in the world, uh, like people can have a better life, and like, like have more fun and be happy for a very long time. 

01:15:20
STUDENT It's important for adults to, to realize that kids have brain powers, because kids are like, some people underestimate kids, and they think, "Oh, it's just a kid." But, uh, kids actually can solve problems. Like, everybody was once a kid. And, kids can learn how to use brain power and can, uh, use like anchoring technique and double vision. And they can even help parents as well. 

01:15:50
PATRICIA BELVEL I think that one of the issues that we're having right now in our society is we have a society based on rewards and punishment. And it doesn't work in a society. It doesn't work in a classroom. It doesn't work to build community. So, when children's behavior is based on rewards and punishment, we're really creating a society that does the right thing only if someone's watching. And, unfortunately we don't have a policeman, or maybe fortunately, on every street or in every home or in every office. So, we're really sustaining and building intrinsic motivation when we allow children to process their behavior, to work out solutions and not to always get something for everything they do. So, any program that can move away from rewards and punishments and begin to have children taking ownership and analyzing their own behavior and processing it and problem solving it is empowering us as a community, as a school, as a nation. 

01:16:50
COMMUNITY All the brain powers an social skills optimized therive much more in a school that emphasizes community. Relationships between older and younger students such as mentoring programs or student leaders can make a big difference. 

01:16:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The last point that I will mention is that all of the brain powers and the social skills optimize thrive much more in schools that emphasize community. The school culture can contribute to these skills blossoming. Relationships between older and younger students such as mentoring programs or student leader programs can make a big difference. 

01:17:15
STUDENT In the upper grades, uh, we have to do community service, and I chose student leaders because I want to show the grades, two, kindergarten to second grade that the bigger kids aren't scary. I sort of help the younger grades, because we seem scary at first, but we're actually not that scary. And we were them once. 

01:17:35
STUDENT Well, like, when, uh, teachers need help, the student leaders can help them. And like, whenever you want to go somewhere, then it's like you have more playmates because they can play with you. And whenever you want to go somewhere, you can just have a student leader go with you so you feel more comfortable. 

01:17:55
STUDENT When there's student leaders at school, it just brings the whole school together. 

01:18:00
STUDENT When kids are missing home or missing their mom, like on the first day of school, student leader can help them solve that. And student leaders are nice because you can know more upper grade people to become your friend. 

01:18:15
Marie-Nathalie BeaudoinEvents that regroup the whole school just to share and enjoy an activity that is fun for everyone can make a difference. I'm not talking here about assemblies, giving awards, since in those events a handful of children have positive feelings while the majority may experience negative feelings such as impatience, exclusion, jealousy or boredom. Those events can accomplish what they accomplish, but I'm talking here to add events where everybody is happy, such as halloween fairs, the hundred day of school parade, appreciation letter day or a weekly singing assemblies. These ideas and activities were taught in California and many other countries of the world. 

01:19:00
THESE IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES WERE TAUGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. 

01:19:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN I hope that this video has given many of you some ideas on how to expand on children's social skill, shifting our focus from focusing on bullying to developing a community of buddies ultimately lead to better academic performance and all children developing their social intelligence. Thank you.
