JAY HALEY In Bali, they have been dancing for a thousand years. From generation to generation they preserved their way of life by passing down their dancing skills. 

00:01:10
[sil.] 

00:01:15
JAY HALEY The island of Bali is one of 13,000 islands in Indonesia. The Balinese have been invaded by modern civilization in the form of 3 million tourists who visit each year. While many cultures have been changed by tourism, the Balinese maintained the integrity of their art and culture despite the commercial invasion. They have little crime or juvenile (inaudible ). 

00:01:50
[sil.] 

00:02:05
JAY HALEY The unique nature of Bali is maintained by the Gods and also by the children. The Gods are appreciated in many temples. The culture is maintained through the dance. It is depended upon the enthusiasm of the children and the teachers who guide them. 

00:02:25
[sil.] 

00:02:40
JAY HALEY Dancing such Hindu epics of the Ramayana transmits the value of their culture. 

00:02:45
[sil.] 

00:04:00
JAY HALEY At an early age the parents introduce children to dance movements. This father and son were filmed by Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, a half a century ago. 

00:04:15
[sil.] 

00:04:40
JAY HALEY They also filmed these children dancing spontaneously in the streets. 

00:04:45
[sil.] 

00:04:55
JAY HALEY Dance is so popular it is routinely taught in the public schools. Like other Balinese activities, dance emphasizes the values of group collaboration not individuality. 

00:05:10
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA My name is Kestri(ph) but American people call me Budaya Wati Supartha. 

00:05:15
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU ARI KENCANA WATI SUPARTHA . And my name is Kepmas(ph). 

00:05:20
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA In her school… 

00:05:20
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU ARI KENCANA WATI SUPARTHA In my school umm… they call me Kencana Wati. We studied when we were like five or four, right. 

00:05:25
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA Hmm… hmm. 

00:05:25
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU ARI KENCANA WATI SUPARTHA But my sister studied at five or six. My mom taught us Java things. Java dance like Sumatra and everything but my dad especially teach us Bali the Balinese. My grandfather used to be a teacher too. 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:05:50
JAY HALEY These young dancers are the daughters of I Gusti Agung Ngurah Supartha, a master dancer who is Director of the Arts Center in Bali. Now he teaches in the United States at the Indonesian Embassy in Washington DC. Like his children he began dancing as early as five-years-old. 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:20
We have two brothers; Jenngal and Pratimawan who are also dancers. 

00:06:30
JAY HALEY When only five-years-old, Supartha organized a group of child dancers. 

00:06:35
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA When I was a child I was the organizer of the (inaudible ) performance, maybe around five or seven years like that. I was had a group of child about 40 people have perform on every ah… moonlight, big moon, in the village. 

00:06:55
JAY HALEY The schools he established in Bali continued to teach children. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:15
JAY HALEY There is a rigorous discipline to the dance, but the children find it fun, as do the teachers in private schools who are not paid. 

00:07:25
[sil.] 

00:07:30
JAY HALEY Often the children dance every day after school as well as in class. 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:08:35
JAY HALEY Each dance is an offering to the Gods in this religion, which is a mixture of Hindu and Animistic beliefs. 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:09:00
JAY HALEY The children learn they're part of a long tradition since each child is considered the reincarnation of the great-grandparents. To find out which great-grandparent influences a child, sometimes the family goes to a local spirit medium who becomes possessed by the grandparents spirit. A child who is a gifted dancer can have inherited that from a great-grandparent. These spirits also lead the Taksu or to dancing with divine inspiration. This can mean going into trance as they dance. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:10:05
JAY HALEY The gods come down from the sacred mountains and possess people, joining the pleasure in the ceremony. 

00:10:10
[sil.] 

00:10:15
JAY HALEY People expect the Gods to enjoy themselves because they're thought of it being playful like children. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:35
JAY HALEY Many children never get formal training in the dance, but they dance in temple ceremonies all their lives. 

00:10:45
[sil.] 

00:10:55
JAY HALEY There are more than 300,000 temples in Bali, if one includes the family temples and there are constant festivals all year around, most of them involve dancing. 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY The (inaudible ) make offerings to the Gods in many forms including the dance. The children live in an atmosphere where offerings are carefully created and carried to the temples. When the Gods have accepted the essence of the offering, the Balinese being a practical people take the offerings back home and dine upon it. 

00:11:45
[sil.] 

00:11:50
JAY HALEY The priest dispense holy water. Children also do so. Because they are more vulnerable possession by the Gods, children are treated as sacred. Traditionally children were taught individually, but today they are taught in groups. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:25
Balinese dance has some simple basic movements which children learn. The main movement is Agam(ph). 

00:12:30
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA We're gonna show you how to do a Agam(ph) to your right. First you spread up your feet, you put your hands like this, thumb in separate your fingers. Then you move your left foot upright on your right foot and then you bend and you move to the sideway to your right and you move your right hand upper than your left and then get to move your head a little down like that you need to shake your hands, fingers. 

00:13:10
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA You know this one not 90 degree here. You get it from here 90 degree from here 90 degree as it from here too. Yes. 

00:13:25
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA Put your hands up, fold your thumb in, separate your fingers and bend down. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:14:00
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA Boys hold up their shoulders and shorten(ph) their necks. 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:10
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA Girls increase the length of their necks. 

00:14:15
JAY HALEY The teacher of this group is a well known dancer and son of a famous dancer. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:35
ANAK AGUNG OKA DALEM Everyday… everyday yeah. Every… at 4 o’clock until 6 o’clock, because in the morning all the children goes to school. 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY Balinese dance movements reflect movements and values in everyday life. Right and left hands move in a opposition providing balance, never moving in the same way. Harmony is strived for in every action by always balancing good and evil. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:15
JAY HALEY In the Balinese dance, the movement of males and females is pleasantly different as Supartha describes. 

00:15:20
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA This feature you move from your (inaudible ) usually we call this you know (inaudible ). 

00:15:30
[sil.] 

00:15:35
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA There is a kind of (inaudible ) strong character like for the war dance (inaudible ) character. Take bigger not one step, but two steps like this (inaudible ). So it becomes like that. Every movement. 

00:16:00
[sil.] 

00:16:05
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA This kind and… and then they use… 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
JAY HALEY Supartha teaches his two sons to dance the strong character. 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:30
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA The main movement that makes Balinese dance different from other dancing, is the movement of the eyes; to look up and side to side. 

00:16:45
JAY HALEY The eye movement may encourage trance. 

00:16:50
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA (inaudible ) have three; this there that. Now the other one we call it Mula(ph). Bigger eyes, but (inaudible ), because I (inaduible ). I begin it from down Agam(ph) here begun it from down here. There are up here this one… this we call it Mula(ph) but the other one is kerja(ph), from side to side. 

00:17:35
[sil.] 

00:17:50
JAY HALEY Showing the teeth in dance indicates aggression. Only women's part their lips and show their teeth, others do not even when angry. One of the life cycle ceremonies is to file down the canine teeth at puberty. This symbolically eradicates the animal nature of both women and men and assures that adults are able to control their emotions. As in the dance they learn the control of every muscle and emotion. 

00:18:25
[sil.] 

00:18:50
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA There is almost no dancing without music. The music called gamelan has (inaudible ) power. 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:20
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA Children must learn to play a different instrument. These are drums, flutes, gongs, (inaudible ) like a xylophone. Tok(ph) is a instrument that goes up with the beat. The beat goes faster, the Tok(ph) goes faster, the beat goes slower it goes slower. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:19:50
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA We have to memorize the music since it is not written down. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:05
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA The drum is important since all the action is set to its time. 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:30
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA These children are learning to drum. They are practicing for a festival, the tektekan(ph); where marching men drive away evil spirits. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:21:05
JAY HALEY One of the most impressive orchestras is the Jegog; in western Bali with the sacred carvings and instruments which are ten foot bamboo poles, large enough to sit upon and be played. There is a single flute. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
JAY HALEY In this pre-Hindu village there is music so sacred it cannot be recorded and is rarely played. This boy is learning to play music gamelan (inaudible ) which was created in 1200. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:50
JAY HALEY The religion of the Balinese is Hindu. Their major Gods are the Hindu trinity, Rama; the creator, Vishnu; the caretaker and Siva; the destroyer. There are many lesser Gods as well as ancestors and demons. The children learn to appreciate a supernatural figure in Bali, the Barong, resembling a Chinese dragon this creature protects the village from all evils. Another supernatural figure is the powerful Rangda, the witch. She represents evil and must be guarded against. 

00:23:30
[sil.] 

00:23:35
JAY HALEY Observers watching the Barong and Rangda often go into trance. Trance is a part of all ceremonies in Bali. The Barong represents good and the witch represents evil. In life and in ceremonies, the Balinese attempt to balance these forces rather than try to get rid of evil. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:50
JAY HALEY A major trance dance is the Kris dance. When possessed by the Gods, men attack themselves with the sharp daggers, yet they are not hurt. Children observe these ceremonies at an early age. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:15
JAY HALEY The Kris experience is part of an old tradition. It was filmed a half century ago by Mead and Bateson. 

00:25:20
Voice of Margaret Mead 

00:25:20
MARGARET MEAD See how that Kris is bent. No one gets hurt if anyone is hurt, the people fail. The trance is not real. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:55
JAY HALEY The Kris's are taken away and the dancers are awakened and cleansed with holy water. After trance the priest return to normal. When asked about the experience, they say they feel tired but very well. Sometimes they don’t remember what happened. 

00:26:20
[sil.] 

00:26:25
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA Acting more than one hour I danced that Barong. Usually I'm not so tired. 

00:26:35
JAY HALEY Supartha danced with the barong mask holding it up himself. It weighs over 75 pounds. He didn’t believe he was in a trance because he remembers everything that happened. 

00:26:45
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA May be (inaudible ) I was tranced and the priest only bring holy water and so on. I told okay thank you but… but I'm not tranced(ph). Three days after that my body is so very heavy here(ph) like broken my head. 

00:27:10
JAY HALEY A few days later he felt the pain. He says he must have been in a trance during the dance if he's so strong. Today the Kris dances and the barong plays are performed daily for the entertainment of thousands of tourists. The dancers must produce a trance on schedule or act one which is different from the experience in the temple. Trance is common throughout Balinese dance. It is a spontaneous occurrence. Trance is also deliberately induced in specially chosen children who are trained for a special ceremony. Their trance indicates possession by the Gods. The young girls go into trance holding on to shaking puppet sticks. 

00:28:05
I Made Bandem, M.A. 

00:28:05
JAY HALEY An authority on this trance dance is Dr. Bandem President of the University of Arts in Bali. He says the girls practice for six months before the actual ceremony. These children are transformed by the trance into virgin nymphs, semi-Gods in Hindu mythology. This practice filmed by Mead and Bateson years ago is still common today. Their assistant and translator was Made Kaler who recalls their careful work when studying the trance dance at that time. 

00:28:45
MADE KALER He went out and (inaudible ) 

00:28:50
JAY HALEY He once told me he kept a camera between his knees and one in his hands while Margaret pointed with (inaudible ) picture. 

00:29:00
MADE KALER Dr. Bateson was the cameraman and Margaret Mead was making the notes. Ms. Margaret Mead was making notes in English and I was making the notes in Balinese. The trance dancing is still going on. 

00:29:25
JAY HALEY Balinese trance was examined by the worlds authority on hypnosis, Dr. Milton H. Erickson. 

00:29:30
Voice of Milton H. Erickson, MD 

00:29:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON (inaudible ) it feel one of Balinese trances and she had her notes and (inaudible ) watch the (inaudible ) and identify who is in a trance and who he was not in the trance. Who was going into a trance and who was coming out. For example, those two girls are dancing and while one is awake, the other is in the trance. Now the one is awake and then the other is gone into trance. The tremendous economy of movement that the Balinese show, tremendous economy and that not exerting, always shows the tremendous economy of movement. 

00:30:30
JAY HALEY Dr. Erickson clarified the similarities between ritual and hypnotic trances. These include a state of absorption, moving limbs as a unit, a rigidity of movements and a minimum use of energy. There is increased muscular tonus, convulsive movements express the fantasies of the action. They are may be amnesia. 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:00
JAY HALEY These children show fetes(ph) of balance as they dance in unison for hours. They are carried around the village on men's shoulders to ward off evil spirits. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:25
JAY HALEY The girls are awakened with incense and holy water. Their song says smoke of the mountains sweet smelling smoke trembling on the spot when pressed down the perfume rises. These dances evolved into the very popular Legong dance where prepubescent girls dance together in unison. 

00:31:50
[sil.] 

00:32:15
JAY HALEY Supartha's father, a dancer recognized his talent early and arranged for him to be taught as a child by the better teachers. 

00:32:30
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA My father received the learning of the (inaudible ) dance from a famous choreographer named (inaudible ) and right now I'm learning that dance. 

00:32:50
[sil.] 

00:32:55
JAY HALEY This dance the (inaudible ) was created by Mario(ph) and passed down to Supartha. I Gusti Agung Ngurah Supartha is not only a musician, dancer and choreographer, but he was Head of the Arts Center in Bali and well known as the teacher of dance. Having won many awards, he has played more than 75 roles and he has created more than 400 musical and dance compositions. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:30
JAY HALEY Supartha was born into a Balinese family which can be traced back for hundreds of years. He was raised in a family of artists in a royal court in central Bali. He played in this palace as a young child. The family has occupied this palace since 16th century. He has several mothers, and many brothers and sisters since his father had four wives. The family sponsors many of the temple ceremonies. 

00:34:05
[sil.] 

00:34:10
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH SUPARTHA My father told me he stayed up all night at the temple ceremonies moving his body. Then one day there would be as many as six ceremonies. When he heard the music from his house, he ran to the temple. He tried to keep his body from moving, but he could not. He danced as long as people did not see him. He tried to imitate the movements. And my father was dead so my grandpa too(ph) normally on the (inaudible ) valley see his sons or daughter dancing they enjoyed so much. Maybe they come to the public they tell oh this is my son and it is my daughter like that. No one will ask but he will )answer like that because they're like enjoying full family if one of them the artist, performing artist. 

00:35:10
JAY HALEY Supartha has become well known in Washington D.C.. He leads his family and others celebrating Indonesian independence day. 

00:35:25

00:35:40
Mas Roro Suestiningtyas Supartha 

00:35:45
JAY HALEY The wife of Supartha is a well-known dancer from Java. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:36:25
I GUSTI AGUNG AYU UTARI BUDAYA WATI SUPARTHA Because we dance so much we seem to spend as much time putting our make-up as we do going to school. 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:50
JAY HALEY Each aspect of the make-up and costume has been carefully done in the same way for centuries. 

00:36:55
[sil.] 

00:37:30
JAY HALEY The eldest son, Jenggal is expected to carry on the family tradition of becoming a master dancer as did his great-grandfather, grandfather and father before. There can be a cultural conflict since he has been living in America and less adapt to the culture including being on the football team. At the same time he must devote his life to Balinese dancing. 

00:37:55
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH KIHASTA KACA JENGGAL SUPARTHA I live in America about six years and the dance is much more difficult, more style to learn, more complicated dance really(ph) football. But the football we gain the toughness to go through the dance. I was disappointed that almost everybody in my school when you ask like ah… “Where are you from?” I say, “I'm from Bali,” and they never heard of my island or my country which is Indonesia. 

00:38:35
JAY HALEY Supartha choreographed this mermaid dance which father and son do together as comic fishermen. Before each performance offerings are made to endure divine inspiration. 

00:38:45
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH KIHASTA KACA JENGGAL SUPARTHA The purpose of the offering is to ensure the performance will be successful in every way. 

00:39:00
[sil.] 

00:39:05
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH KIHASTA KACA JENGGAL SUPARTHA I enjoy doing that dance with my dad because it was not a strict dance, it was like a lose village dance, where you're a member of the village where you are a regular man and then you're going to fish in the street. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:55
I GUSTI AGUNG NGURAH KHASTA KACA JENGGAL SUPARTHA I also teach dance and music. I use the style of my father teaching.

00:40:25
JAY HALEY Dance like life in Bali, maintains the traditional forms while changing. Supartha created new forms, one of them being the depiction of animals. This was not previously done in the past. His famous deer dance is especially enjoyed by children and is taught all over Bali.
