University of Wales, Newport Prifysgol Cymru, Casnewydd Francesca Inskipp and Brigid Proctor in conversation with Frank Wills a programme from the School of Social Studies

00:00:45
MIKE SIMMONS Hello my name is Mike Simmons and I’m a lecturer in counseling at the University of Wales, Newport in the School of Social Studies. We're developing a catalogue of videos and DVDs here focused on counseling, training and related subjects. In this interview with Francesca Inskipp and Brigid Proctor is the fourth in our in-conversation series. Francesca and Brigid have had a profound impact on the world of counseling and it's undeniable that without them counseling in the UK simply wouldn’t be what it is today. In the 1970’s and 1980’s, they made pioneering contributions to counseling training. Francesca broadcast the well known principles of counseling series on BBC Radio and a handbook on training and counseling skills was so unique that it seemed like it was being used by just about every trainer in Britain. Brigid wrote the highly influential Counseling Shop, which again drew the public’s attention to the fact that there were many different kinds of counseling, and that counseling itself was rather more than a process to simply help people and get things off their chest. As counseling became more established, the need for supervision also became apparent. And this was another field in which Francesca and Brigid made major contributions with books such as the Art and Craft of Counseling Supervision and Group Supervision, one of the very few specialist books on that subject. Women have always made up the majority of the counseling workforce in Britain. So it's particularly pleasing that Francesca and Brigid, women who have made such telling contributions to the foundation and ongoing development of British counseling are acknowledged for the work that they have done. You're going to see them interviewed in this program by a colleague of mine in the university, Frank Wills. Frank is a trainer, a therapist, and a writer and has a key in awareness of counseling issues in the UK. It should be an interesting program. And now is time to watch it. 

00:03:10
FRANK WILLS I'd like to offer you both a very big welcome to University of Wales at Newport. And as you know we’re going to spend a little bit of time dialoging, talking, discussing and how counseling has been developing and your own particular contributions to that, your very significant contributions to that. And I understand you met in 1973 at a conference and I thought that might be quite a place for us to actually make a start. So, Brigid would you mind telling me what you remember of that? 

00:03:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, well I do. My memory is terrible, but Francesca has told me that and I believe it to be true. I do remember we met on a, we met on a train going up to Rugby. Because after a lot of pressuring, the standing conference for the advancement of counseling which was BAC and then BACP's predecessor, had done nothing about training. And we had pushed, I'm sure both in our own individual ways in other people to have some kind of gathering of trainers to talk about what was happening in counseling training. And I think there are about 24 people, may be a few more that, I can’t remember. And we were both invited. And I was really very new in the counseling training trade then, you had been around much longer. And we came up on the same train and there wasn’t a taxi, right? And so we kind of said were we going up to the conference, yes we were and we, we started to talk and we’ve been really working together even since on and off, haven’t us? 

00:04:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes! 

00:04:50
FRANK WILLS Francesca, what do you remember of that, at that time? 

00:04:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well, you know as Brigid said we met, we met that way. And I can remember that we were a bit overload by the conference, by the people who were there. There were people who were much more better (inaudible ) or Peter Dewhurst and Patrick Hughes. 

00:05:11
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:05:11
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And Isca Wittenberg from Tavi and quite a few people there. And most of them, stuff(ph) was psychodynamic really, psychodynamic or person-centered. 

00:05:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:05:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I can’t remember what happened during the conference. There must be some… I don't whether any record left with it at all. 

00:05:30
BRIGID PROCTOR No, I can’t remember. And I don’t think anything at that stage came out of it. I think it was considerably late like decades when they started to get together to do some form of accreditation of the counseling courses. And there was just a great deal of difference about how it should be done. Really wasn’t it? 

00:05:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah, so we were the small courses compared with the Reading and Keele and then Swansea started up and Exeter. They were the big… They were the big courses when we started up, yes. And… And I had this course that I took over had been started a year ago at North East London Poly and the tutor had left it. I had taken over a rather disastrous course there. And you got building a new course. 

00:06:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, I was at South West London College, it is started because, I mean counseling courses in those days started in all sorts of different ways. The one that Francesca started was mainly were out of the educational and the one you had mentioned now, educational or youth work. 

00:06:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Oh, mine was an educational one, teachers were seconded(ph) per year onto that course… 

00:06:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:06:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …and from schools so it was a full-time course. 

00:06:50
BRIGID PROCTOR But ours came because the welfare offices, welfare offices of LEA(ph) in the London Educational Authority as then was, felt that they weren’t properly, didn’t get proper credence in their colleges. So they wanted some kind of course and they had heard there was a thing called counseling. And they thought they will have a counseling course, no welfare office to set it up and got a psychiatrist to help. And they literally scissored-and-pasted, I've never heard that expression before. They picked bits out of here and there and stuck it together and called it a counseling course. 

00:07:25
FRANK WILLS An eclectic approach? 

00:07:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah, you can say that. I don’t think you had any right counseling and that you would have things like management. 

00:07:30
FRANK WILLS And it sounds, you know quite a ad-hoc field, you know developments might crop up because someone was there and wanted to do things? 

00:07:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely! 

00:07:40
FRANK WILLS And of course on the downside there is, it was a bit fragmented and, on together we might say today. But on the other hand there were opportunities for people to do things. 

00:07:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP That was wonderful. We've often said, how lucky we were. 

00:07:55
BRIGID PROCTOR We were in the beginning how exciting… 

00:07:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah to do your own thing a base as well. 

00:08:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely, yeah absolutely. 

00:08:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so, so going back to that time and I mean so you, it sounds like this was an important experience, an important meeting although the details as your conference have obscured but. How did you may be come out of that thinking about what needed to be done? 

00:08:20
BRIGID PROCTOR I mean, I can't really remember but I think my feeling was that, because I had been trained as a psychodynamically orientated case worker in the social work field, I really, really appreciated the training I got for social psychodynamic case work, which is almost exactly the same as psychodynamic counseling. I really don’t think you could have told the difference. I had no counseling training, never heard of counseling till game(ph) involved in the counseling course. You know, it's shocking to say, but it’s true. And, and I just thought that the way that, that, that school of thinking approach training was very much just by you having your own kind of therapy and learning the about transference and counter transference and somehow learning to sit with clients and then, and kind of pick up hunches about the transference and counter transference and stuff. And I thought it was brilliant, because I still do things, it's absolutely brilliant. But I found it not very helpful for a lot of the people that came and were wanting to learn how to help people in a rather, quite simple people in a rather simple way. 

00:09:40
FRANK WILLS One of the things I remember about that particular year of having been a bit connected with myself at that time was I can’t quite remember the phrase that was used but and you would make a complete record of the… 

00:09:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Process record. 

00:09:55
FRANK WILLS …process record. 

00:09:55
BRIGID PROCTOR That's what, that's what you did. 

00:09:55
FRANK WILLS …and that was really the main… 

00:10:00
BRIGID PROCTOR …the main that’s right. 

00:10:00
FRANK WILLS …the main ah… method actually at that time. 

00:10:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, yes and supervision. They did have supervision. 

00:10:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so, so you wanted to move this agenda forward though? 

00:10:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Well yes I didn’t quite know how but it happened on our course we had, we seemed to be good at getting people to come and help. And between us we discovered that we had, you know the psychodynamic people somebody would have some Rogerian training, somebody who would be in lot of T-groups, somebody who is Gestalt, somebody who is TA, all the things which I hadn’t heard about at all. 

00:10:35
FRANK WILLS Uh…Huh… 

00:10:40
BRIGID PROCTOR And we learnt from each other and began to discover that it was basically humanistic, because those days there was a lot of development in the humanistic side of things. And, and we had to put it together for ourselves really, because as Francesca knows there are waves and waves of missionaries coming from America all with a new gospel. 

00:11:05
FRANK WILLS Selling gospels. 

00:11:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes (inaudible ) salesmen, missionaries are salesman, selling a new package every two years really. And it was somehow trying to put that stuff together. 

00:11:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:11:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Wasn’t it? 

00:11:15
FRANK WILLS And it's interesting that I sat with you before that one of the minor pleasures of preparing myself for this interview was to find your old book Counseling Shop. And I heard the chapter headings in pretty well the influence as you described with the people who were working at that time. 

00:11:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:30
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:11:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:11:35
FRANK WILLS I would like to come to that a little bit later from under the general this(ph) relational theory. But I wonder if I could come to you now Francesco, because it seems to me I could imagine now that how this agenda that was developing towards a more specified I think area of learning. You know kind of links in with skilled learning. 

00:12:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well it wasn’t at the beginning. 

00:12:05
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:12:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Because I’ve, I took this job, um… the head of the counseling service who had set up a counseling service (inaudible ) Hans Hoxter who had one of the, I mean I think he is being the man who brought counseling really to, to this country originally. Because he set up the, originally there was a committee set up worrying about mental health and deciding that what we needed to do was to deal with mental health and schools, because people were becoming mentally ill and if they dealt with it earlier on and the work from America had started already in schools. And he brought over various famous people from America, Leona Tyler, and Gilbert Wrenn, (inaudible ). Hans had… He was somehow was an entrepreneur there. 

00:13:00
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:13:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And a difficult man to work with, but a wonderful man in many ways. And so he had set up, and he set up his diploma at North East London. He persuaded the principle to set it up. It had been set up (inaudible ) or been been set up by a health visitor on the whole who thought counseling was a sort of form of health visiting. And they recruited an educational psychologist, a sociologist and social, social policy. That’s right. We had these four different things and they all took place in different, in different bits of the polytechnics. So the students had to move from… When I took this course they were moving to all these different places. And with Hans help, we established the one in the, which was an old cigarette factory in Stafford in London there. And we established a base there and the people came in and talked there rather than the students having to go out. And this was a course which was set up by London University Extramural Department there. So it was a diploma which was examined by them. So it was completely different. It was very structured course in which we have to obey the university instructions and move with this. So very different from Brigid’s in which they were designing their own courses. 

00:14:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah! 

00:14:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And there… So that was some of the beginnings of this. And it was also, Hans had also got a career's course running with Peter Heaviside in-charge there and in fact we did some work together. When I was at Keele, Leonie Taylor had been across and taught. It was part of there, I was there in 1970. And she had sent a book across written by a student of hers called Susan Gilmore which was the training of counselors. And this was a draft copy which I think copied at one time, took it back and used it with youth workers so I was working with it at that time before I went into the polytechnic. And then I started using that at the polytechnic for her of a main way of training counselors in small groups and using particularly looking at counseling, doing counseling in a group with feedback and beginning to look at skills as well and looking and saying she has written stuff about how you expressed empathy. 

00:15:30
FRANK WILLS The Gilmore groups. 

00:15:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Gilmore groups, yes. 

00:15:35
FRANK WILLS It seems to me when I read what you said about this that there was a kind of extension from Rogers to Carkhuff in particular who operated (crosstalk)(inaudible) skills. 

00:15:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I met Carkhuff when I was at Keele. Carkhuff came and spoke and I thought that that seemed to me, because I had come from teaching originally. And Carkhuff appealed to all my teaching things that structured stuff much more and said beyond Rogers, yes these are necessary but they are not sufficient, the three of the core qualities. And Carkhuff really was, he and Ivey who had begun to set up schools down in America, there that game was influential. And then after I had been at the polytechnic about six months I suppose or a bit longer, I was walking up Camden High Street compendium, which was the, the growth bookshop at that time there. And in the window was some big orangey brown books called the Skilled Helper. And I went in and I opened this book and it was just, it was just Rogers, Carkhuff, Ivey. They're all with it together, which I had been trying to put together myself and it was all there put together for me. It was a just a miracle it felt like. 

00:16:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah and just down on the theory side of that, because I remember also seeing the first edition of this book. 

00:16:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Uh…Huh… Yeah. 

00:16:55
FRANK WILLS And what really appealed to me was, I think what seems to appeal to you was this you know the kind of the, the strong relationship aspect but also a kind of a recognition of the face where you were then going to more, more active. 

00:17:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP You were moving forward. There was this lovely three-stage, which were so simple at the beginning explore, understand, act. 

00:17:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:17:20
FRANK WILLS Right! And it sounds like you may be also have the same feeling as I do that you know the subsequent editions may be haven’t clarified as much as we all hoped. 

00:17:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I've just read the fifth edition recently. I’ve just been through the fifth edition to help somebody with it, with an essay with it. And it really is much, much more difficult together. 

00:17:40
FRANK WILLS Got a bit more cluttered. 

00:17:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, yes. 

00:17:45
FRANK WILLS Okay so you know where I’m going to go from here, I’m sure is to the radio series which you did with the Hazel Johns… 

00:17:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:17:50
FRANK WILLS …on the principles of counseling. The first one came out in the late 70’s and the second series came out in the, in the early 80’s. 

00:18:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:18:00
FRANK WILLS And there was you know booklets and, and tapes one could buy eventually. 

00:18:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, well eventually they took the tapes and made them into, BBC didn’t want them unless we could be sure we would sell 3,000 copies. But of course since then we’ve sold much more than 3,000 copies. But at that time it didn’t seem likely so the producer said to us take all the BBC stuff off, so that it's not recognized as BBC stuff. And most of it had been at the polytechnic. We had used students although because we had made it, Hazel and I had made in the, in the studio. We had this wonderful experience of being in the BBC studio as where many famous people had worked there and did this. We had a very good producer, we were lucky. The first edition went into five repeats for the BBC there, because it was the most popular study on phone(ph) that they’d done at that time. Because we just hit the right market when counseling was just opening there. And yes so it was after I had retired from polytechnic at that time Hazel had moved on. And I took… We took the tapes and offered(ph) them and then I set up a small business as part of my retirement in setting it up. And then people kept writing and then saying could we expand the booklets that we had originally written, the little booklets with it and that was when I started writing the manual of exercises and things to go with it. 

00:19:25
FRANK WILLS And that became the handbook… 

00:19:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP That became the handbook. NAC wrote to me at one point and were interested in taking those and the tapes. But I didn’t have the tapes but they took the handbook. 

00:19:35
FRANK WILLS So I think I told you earlier actually that you know when I first began working here in the sort of mid-80’s that we, that the tapes and the handbook were amongst our main resources. We not only in terms of actually using those materials, but actually the rationale behind, you know a lot of the exercises. 

00:19:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Uh…Huh… 

00:20:00
FRANK WILLS And you just want slightly personal note here actually is that I’ve always felt myself that when your teaching skills, it’s really important to demonstrate the skills to the students you know. 

00:20:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Uh…Huh… Yeah. 

00:20:15
FRANK WILLS Even if you do it not so well kind of thing and sometimes that can be helpful I think, if you did it not so. And then so you get cycles of them, you know demonstration, practice, discussion, actions so forth and yes I find awful lot of our colleagues don’t seem terribly keen to do that actually. I’m not talking about you must have well said all the(ph)… 

00:20:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Uh…Huh… Yes! Uh…Huh… 

00:20:40
FRANK WILLS So I was really pleased and you acknowledged that point in one of the, one of the books about the importance of demonstration. 

00:20:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, yes! Well I think it shows if you are asking the students to do it. If you do it yourself it doesn’t encourage them but it is frightening. 

00:21:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah you can’t believe it keeps on going right and it's got to go really about the wrong way all these day. I guess what I’m now would have a sense of it at this time that there really was something which one might call the counseling skills movement, now I think by the 1980’s there were a lot of people who were more convinced that that way of… 

00:21:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, yes, I think so by that time we could have some again Hans Hoxter had started up with nurses. He had set up counseling for nurses and they took up the counseling skills very much there. and then clergy, prison officers, we had a whole range of people who came partly through the BBC programs and came to the polytechnic courses there. But I think that had spread the counseling skills movement into the other helping professions. 

00:21:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. I mean the diploma we ran was called the called the Diploma in Counseling Skills, because we were passionate at that time. And I think it seems to me much more important to have people who are working at the coalface(ph) and medicine and social work, youth work, the church, you know in an addiction center anything, to be able to use counseling appropriately and the counseling skills appropriately in that setting. It was really nice to have a counseling skills language. You could say it is different from counseling, I remember doing something with the youth service in 70 sometime, really spelling out distinction between counseling skills and counseling was. Because we had do that for people on the cost to help them really understand that, because to come on our course they had to be doing, using counseling skills. They weren't being trained to be counselors as some of them were and went away with the Diploma in Counseling Skills. And on their diploma it said that while practicing as a counselor you know in college or whatever it was. But the counseling skills was the core of it, because of the kind of really political stance that it shouldn’t be something for individuals who could afford it or could access charity in some private room. It should be available like you’re saying about child guidance clinics and you know it was really available to the general public in a routine kind of way that people would relate to them and help them explore what they wanted from their lives in a routine way almost. 

00:23:40
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah! One and… One piece of work that I did in one station in my career was actually to work as a social worker attached in a health center. 

00:23:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:23:50
FRANK WILLS And at that time counseling was still defined as one of the main activities of social work profession. 

00:23:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:23:55
FRANK WILLS And I was used to do a lot of counseling in that position. And you know I can (inaudible ) the usefulness of that I think you know because you’re very accessible. 

00:24:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:24:10
FRANK WILLS So the counseling movement was kind of really, counseling skills movement rather was really getting underway at this point in time. But I know there was may be some colleagues who didn’t intentionally share the enthusiasm for this. 

00:24:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, I mean, certainly I remember the chair of BAC kind of saying in some introductory speech or rather quite kind of scathing remark about teaching people to parrot. Parrot or people were saying and how you couldn’t possibly develop soul and caring through skills. And, and it took, I mean, I don’t think I have those skills but I, I might have thought I would have come from that school. But having met Francesca and having started to think in those terms, I was just amazed by how learning the skills produced the empathic rapport really. I mean, that somehow people who didn’t have it naturally could do it by learning how to give good attention. How to pick out what the other person was saying, give it them back, that it actually, it lead them in to developing the very kind of things that the other people were suggesting they couldn’t possibly get that way. 

00:25:40
FRANK WILLS Uh…Huh… Yes so, I mean, it could work both ways round, it could work from a kind of values and attitudes toward skills or sometimes skills and attitudes toward values. 

00:25:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely! I mean, I think what, in a different context what Michael Ready(ph) the TA who was, he said it doesn’t matter what side the horse people get on as long as they get on the horse. 

00:26:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Right. 

00:26:00
BRIGID PROCTOR It seemed to me that the training had gone before it was about getting on the horse only one way. It was really inappropriate for a lot of people. The skills way gave you a totally alternative way to them getting on the horse and turn that I thought to be really, dramatically good. 

00:26:20
FRANK WILLS And the main thing is beyond the horse and I suppose. 

00:26:20
BRIGID PROCTOR The only thing is, are they are on the horse? 

00:26:25
FRANK WILLS You're right. Francesca what, what are your thoughts? 

00:26:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well I would say in those days, I mean, there was, when BAC was beginning service, it was still stake(at) at time. Wasn’t it stake(ph) for a quite a long time? And then BAC came with various divisions in it and with very strong psychodynamic movement. I mean, they were the strongest people in BAC then. And there was a lot of resistance from them on the whole about skills really that was very suspicious about them. I'm suspicious about person-centered work too I think often. 

00:26:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:26:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So that was quite a lot of distention between… 

00:27:00
FRANK WILLS What were the nature of the reservations or suspicions? 

00:27:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well it wasn’t, it wasn't unless you were, you weren’t, you weren't setting up a relationship you were involved in a transparent(ph) relationship and that’s what was important part of it. Whereas Rogers one was to be in a real relationship than a real working relationship. And that’s what the attention giving in the listening did. And I think by teaching people, listening and empathic skills, they then had to give complete attention. And I think that, that attention, that energy is somewhere one of the most important things of building. But, but it was not exactly fights but, well I mean, that still went on, we went on to tribalism. You know and still then and of course then… 

00:27:50
BRIGID PROCTOR But it is, it is a philos… I mean it is a major philosophical and practical difference. 

00:27:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:27:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Is the core therapeutic ingredients or if not therapeutic, almost quite educational or transformational ingredient. Is it to do with a relationship established between two real people who agree together to do something that they both know about from different sides? Or is it more in the skill of the counselor person or psychotherapist person to understand more than the client possibly can about why they might be doing or feeling certain things? And… And although that’s you know they can be both at extreme ends there is somewhere in the, however much you meet, there is somewhere in the middle, something about do I, to what extent is the counselor some sort of special expert and that’s where their skill and power belongs. Or to what extent are we just trotting along behind that clients? And it’s, it’s… That somewhere in the middle there is an actual… 

00:29:10
FRANK WILLS Yes, yes, yeah. 

00:29:10
BRIGID PROCTOR …difference of, of understanding about where that catalytic… 

00:29:15
FRANK WILLS Could, could I try to run something positive from my own thoughts from this actually to see what you both think about and see whether I can publish it again for the approval possibly. One argument that I've been interested in is that we come briefly to CBT here but there are some extremely well researched concepts of how depression actually works and how one can impact on it. And I in my practice, I do regard myself as having expertise in that, in the model, but what I don’t know though is whether, how that model of how depression in general works is working with this particular person. And that I can’t really, I can’t help him with just that general model. I’ve to… And he has to join with me to make that something which is unique to him, because everyone has their own although there are similarities in depression you know there are also differences. 

00:30:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP You’re saying he has to work with you to do it? 

00:30:30
FRANK WILLS Yes, yes. 

00:30:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, so that you have to involve him. 

00:30:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, absolutely yeah. 

00:30:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP In learning your, in learning the language of CBT may be? 

00:30:40
FRANK WILLS Well that could be, but it is really was the understanding I suppose. 

00:30:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, I mean, this may go beyond what you wanted to ask later. It seems I’ve always wished, I’ve always thought there should be some overarching, theoretical understanding that, that all the bits when I read Counseling Shop and interviewed ten different people and different things, I kind of thought they're all people I trust and I would trust another person with, there must be some overarching thing. And I think one of things that we’ve often missed, Young had it I suppose, and I think NLP, Neuro-Linguistic Programming is on to it in a really big way, is the acknowledgment of the very different way that different people understand, receive and upgrade, psychological types if you like of people. And based on neurophysiology and, and within those, within different types or different, everyone is unique anyway. So somehow or rather it seems to me that that I know there are people who like being a client and get really good result as a client from working in ways I absolutely couldn’t bare to or wouldn’t want to. And one has to take that, that has to be true. 

00:32:15
FRANK WILLS Uh…Huh… Yeah. 

00:32:15
BRIGID PROCTOR But how you fit the way of working to the person and the care with which you understand that and try and, it seems to me to be something that’s been quite a lot missed, missed out. It seems like a whole another bag that may be old in neurophysiological research and stuff. It will be more helpful about. Am I making… 

00:32:35
FRANK WILLS Absolutely yeah, yeah. 

00:32:35
BRIGID PROCTOR And that’s a big bit of an overarching dimension that will be missed. 

00:32:40
FRANK WILLS I mean to take for example though you know that the (inaudible ) types and in which had been partly operational by the (inaudible ). We have the kind of thinking and feeling type in a way you wouldn’t expect those two types that respond to the same interventions you know. 

00:33:00
Absolutely… 

00:33:00
FRANK WILLS But I also think there are some paradoxical effects that actually sometimes although a person might be a very feeling orientated person, actually what they may need is a bit more (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:33:15
BRIGID PROCTOR I do agree, but the lead in and the establishment of the rapport and establishment of the language needs NLP say pace, pace, pace lead in other words you follow a person, you follow their language, their way of, as far as you can understand it interacting with the world. And then after that when you’ve done that, you’ve established it, then you can, you can help people develop the things that if you move straight in on. 

00:33:50
FRANK WILLS You would hit some wall. 

00:33:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Um… 

00:33:55
FRANK WILLS Okay, glad you brought up Counseling Shop, because that’s pretty, what I was going to head for next. And what, what we have there? I mean I must say actually personally I greatly enjoyed that book when I came across it. It was got an influential thing that I read. I think it was the first time I realized there were quite a few different ways of doing this and that was exciting and, and interesting. So I'd like to, may be if you can tell me a little bit more about the experience of writing that because again you, you note in the text itself about how you actually liked all the people that, that you ended up interviewing. And then I'd like to perhaps move to consideration of, of how you see those multiple models now particularly in relation to this term we’ve thrown in every now and again, tribalism. But can we just go with, with the Counseling Shop first and? 

00:34:50
Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:55
FRANK WILLS But perhaps and, you could just be by explaining the, the structure of the book and so forth because probably some people want to… 

00:35:05
BRIGID PROCTOR It is pretty odd in doing a Ph.D actually. It was a kind of a research project but for myself. Because I landed in this kind of course and turned out to be rather good at engaging staff out of nowhere. I was engaged as of out of nowhere and they were engaged, a really a kind of peculiar process that people just somehow emerged. And we had this really throughout my working life, a most dramatic and dynamic staff team from all kind of different places. And, and I was laid(ph), I had met Francesco and learned about Egan never heard of him. I learnt about Rogers from Pat Milner and Gay Houston. I learnt about (inaudible ) from Marshall Reynolds. I didn't know any of these things and I learnt about them from people who had been disciples in different places and came and brought this into the course. And I just, it was really confusing and, and I knew the students were being terribly confused. And I also knew it was great for them to have access to these wonderful people, in wonderful different ways of working. And so I decided to, to pick ten people and interview them about and thought up the questionnaire which I still feel very pleased and proud of, which typically of me started the wider thing about what’s your model of man? So on the last round I was kind and how does this apply particularly where you work and so? I think I can’t remember them now really. 

00:36:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I’ve got the tape still. 

00:36:30
BRIGID PROCTOR You still have the tapes! 

00:36:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP That we made, yes. Because that was one of the way (crosstalk)(inaudible). That’s the way, one of the ways we kept in touch. I think because you were doing the books and after we met and that was one of the ways I could remember you. 

00:36:40
BRIGID PROCTOR So I just interviewed ten, ten different people on tape which you know, had a board doing that. And then tried to do an introduction and a finishing off, which it tried to make sense for me of, of how it could be that these people all of whom I really rated. And thought you know all of them I thought were really exceptionally good, were trustworthy people that I would happy to send anybody to really. Could all work so differently and have such different passionate views. 

00:37:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

00:37:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah so, so what’s, what kind of conclusion did personal conclusion did you? 

00:37:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Well I thought that they had different roots, I think the thing that struck me most was that the European, the European ways of thinking especially in the psychodynamic, different psychodynamic ways had come from a depressed and old continent, who had terrible wars I think. I think the other people must have said it, but it to me it was a new thought. And that the American ones were, were full of optimism and enthusiasm and the sense that everything could be for good you know in the best of all possible world. And, and both came out of the history really. And that was the main thing. And also the different things paid attention to different again would be particularly suitable for different kinds of people. 

00:38:10
FRANK WILLS What about different kinds of problems as well? 

00:38:15
BRIGID PROCTOR And different kind of problems and different kind of problems. I think I thought less of that. I think I wasn’t thinking so much in terms of different kinds of problems. I mean, subsequently in my working life I’ve know that I don’t want to work with people with addiction, without really knowing about addiction or depression that there is really stuff to be known that one should know. But I don’t think I felt that at that time. I kind of thought everything could be dealt through a good relationship and skills. 

00:38:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think that the theoretical thing was about people, about personal development, about development that was the big part that was taught. Not problems so much, so it was much more about people. And that all of the theories were based very much on… 

00:39:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Personal development. 

00:39:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …on the developmental stages where they were peaceful(ph). 

00:39:05
FRANK WILLS I mean it’s a striking title - Counseling Shop. 

00:39:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:39:10
FRANK WILLS So, let's just play with shop for a moment. 

00:39:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Very few people. 

00:39:15
FRANK WILLS What were you guessing at? 

00:39:15
BRIGID PROCTOR There are very few people saw the… saw that the pan(ph), you know I thought it was Counseling Shop people taught like shop talk about shop and… and counseling shop because here was a variety of things, a lot of people said they hated the title, it looks like a supermarket. They didn’t understand the pan(ph)… 

00:39:30
FRANK WILLS Right, alright. 

00:39:35
BRIGID PROCTOR …I was disappointed in. Anymore on that? 

00:39:35
FRANK WILLS Well, and… I see yes, it's interesting actually because the umm… yeah, I… I didn’t I must admit that I didn’t read that your pan(ph). 

00:39:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

00:39:45
FRANK WILLS But how I… I read it was this… this was like a… a shop you could go into and… 

00:39:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, umm… 

00:39:50
FRANK WILLS …looking for things on the… 

00:39:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. I’m in that… 

00:39:50
FRANK WILLS …on the shelves and you might buy one thing or not buy another thing. 

00:39:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. I… I mean that… 

00:39:55
FRANK WILLS Consumer, may be in the supermarket. 

00:40:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, I’m in that too really. 

00:40:00
FRANK WILLS Yes, yes. In that book I… I read a kind a statement, isn’t this exciting there are all these things here? And yet, in tribalism, I hear that some things, you know not so good about tribalism, it's like people fighting or you know not getting or not seeing each others point of view… 

00:40:15
BRIGID PROCTOR I think… I think it's going to become systematized. I think it's… 

00:40:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:40:20
BRIGID PROCTOR …not the… it’s not the thinking and the practice and the innovation of development and creativity. It's… Tribalism seems I… I… I use the world tribalism when people umm… start to become uh… what’s ah… institutionalized… 

00:40:40
FRANK WILLS Defend their territory? 

00:40:40
BRIGID PROCTOR When… When their… They defend the territory, they set up a territory, they defend the territory when you can only ever have access to somebody from that territory in your training and in your supervision, so that people actually become immured and they don’t know anything about anything else and they feel it isn’t the right thing. The only right thing is they’re tribe. And you get that in… in… in psychodynamic work, you get it in the different divisions of psychodynamic work… 

00:41:10
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:41:10
BRIGID PROCTOR …you get it in person-centered work, you get it in CBT. It seems like the… the… the ability to become tribal in that way. 

00:41:20
FRANK WILLS Right, I see, okay! 

00:41:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Is… Is a… It happens in every other walk of life, it happens in counseling and psychotherapy. 

00:41:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP It's such a human thing I wanted to belong to a tribe, I wanted to belong… 

00:41:30
FRANK WILLS Well, to belong to somewhere, yes. 

00:41:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And one of the strongest ways of belonging is to make everybody else outside wrong. 

00:41:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:41:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely. 

00:41:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And different. 

00:41:40
FRANK WILLS Can I… Can I try another metaphor with you, which you may have heard. And it's really about the Berlin Wall metaphor, that if you think about what the Berlin Wall was, it was umm… you know it was a very umm… a big barrier between two different cultural and social… social systems. You know umm… But the wall can come down and then people can crossover the borders and they can trade and they can do various things. But we don’t end up, we just want wall and the… and the… and the wall comes down, which… which would go back to umm… now to you know a quotation, I quoted to you before, we started this umm… that you made absolute true cooperation comes from acknowledgements are difference. 

00:42:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:42:30
FRANK WILLS And also recognizing the similarity. And you know, what one slight reservation I have about some of the discussion that goes around umm… integration is that when people start saying, well it’s all the same, it's just different task because I really don’t, I think there are significant differences and I somehow think that we can’t really get to grips with them until we… we recognize what they are. 

00:42:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:43:00
FRANK WILLS And that’s… So the tribalism then… Am I now understanding correctly though it's… it's not so much that there are differences, but the… the people use those differences to fight and claim territory… 

00:43:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm… 

00:43:10
FRANK WILLS …and maybe sometimes exclude other people? 

00:43:15
BRIGID PROCTOR And to cut themselves off from some possibilities and… and cut their clients off, which is the important thing from the… the possibility of… of seeing them afresh and thinking differently about how it might be if it isn’t working for instance. 

00:43:30
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:43:30
BRIGID PROCTOR You know if what they’re doing doesn’t work well for the client uh… not having a wider vision of thinking what… what I could they be doing that could help this person more if anything umm… because they haven’t heard about it. 

00:43:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. As Eagan says, as long as it's ethical. 

00:43:44
BRIGID PROCTOR As long as it's ethical! 

00:43:44
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:43:44
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And helps. 

00:43:44
BRIGID PROCTOR Try it. 

00:43:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Try it. It's useful (Inaudible ) also saying. 

00:43:51
FRANK WILLS Pragmatism. 

00:43:51
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Pragmatism, yes, yeah! And I mean it is it's umm… I mean, that’s what seems to me a… a good integration is because they are there that integrating the similarities, isn’t it? When people have found a lot of similarities across. I think the different ones. I mean, they really but it's then when some of them feel… some of the tribes feel threatened and then come out and say well, you can you know, you must go to supervision and you must only do this training there with this because otherwise you will umm… harm your clients by muddling them. 

00:44:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Muddle the clients. 

00:44:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, muddle the clients. But I mean when you ask majority of compliment, I suppose the majority of diploma courses now are probably integrated. So they are. 

00:44:40
BRIGID PROCTOR And I mean, it is… there is a difference between integrative from eclectic, isn’t it? 

00:44:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:44:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:44:40
BRIGID PROCTOR The… It's noted to be eclectic and I still think it's noted to be eclectic, we just… I’ll try a bit of this and try a bit of that. But in fact it was a great relief to me when I found that… I think it was met on word where it really started off Patricia Clarkson who started off having the temerity to call something integrative. 

00:44:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:05
BRIGID PROCTOR And uh… And I thought, yeah that’s a kind of thing I was wanting. It isn’t that you want just to try a bit of this or pick this off the shelf and that, but that people be challenged to think of their own basic underlying values and what… how they think people learn and change and those big questions I asked. And having decided that, can… can… can umm… How the ethics that go with that and… and thinking about so how might that you know because one of the ones in the counseling shop is reality therapy, wasn’t it, which you can be quite brutal, but which was very much about you know what’s gonna happen if you do this and let's follow this along the line, which was very unlike a lot of other counseling things. I think it's ideal in some circumstances, you know countered in prisons or kids in school. We really want them to… to reality test. 

00:46:00
FRANK WILLS Okay. One thing umm… I would like to so go into this a bit more and umm… and I want to just tell you something that umm… somebody said during… during my first training, interestingly was actually in alcohol counseling. Umm… And we used to have a case discussion group. And it was led by an extremely able and good psychiatrist who worked in the alcohol field. And I remember one of the… the things he said to me which is kind of what was chasing me a bit, you know particularly when I became a kind of educationist was that he… he said that umm… when… when you’ve seen umm… 50 clients with alcohol problems, you will have then seen most of the major variations that you’re likely to see, you know. And umm… I don’t… I know that this wasn’t an argument about seeing each client as an individual… 

00:46:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:46:55
FRANK WILLS …but it was about just knowing how certain types of drinking developed and worked and so forth. And… And the reason why I found that chastening was because I thought, my goodness, this is you know quite a narrow area we’re learning here, alcohol problems. And so, you know if it takes 50 clients to get good at that and I know teaching people who are seeing all sorts of different clients. How many clients I gonna… I gonna have to see before they get good of this you know? And I expect this may be a certain exaggeration there, but… but that… that… that’s an… I mean if we talk umm… integration say, in relation to you know to cognitive behavior therapy, there are various things which might lend themselves you know for you saying in integrated counseling like just as one example, a thought record is something that can be used helpfully in all kinds of situations. But now, have… having been you know a CBT therapist for, you know so 10 years basically, that umm… and I… I’m still finding out the clients and odd things that the way people react to just as one technique. You know, and so I kind of feel like it… it… it takes time to get good at doing things, you know and it really does. And so, therefore, I worry a little bit about trying to umm… umm… become good at doing an awful lots of things, because umm… at least umm… when you're mainly concentrating on say cognitive therapy, then although some of the techniques are all different there’s… there is a similar underlying rationale to them, which you don’t have to relearn each time you do them sort of things. So… So that’s my reservation really… 

00:48:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Correct. 

00:48:45
FRANK WILLS …about that and why… to some extents I would stick out for drive those persons? 

00:48:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:48:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I… I think… I think you’re right with that in some ways because I see some diploma courses who call themselves humanistic and will do person-centered (inaudible ) and sort of integrate them and I find the students are often muddled of how, that’s bit taking bits there, somewhere there. But I would have thought that now when people are teaching cognitive behavioral, I imagine that umm… it's also teaching relationship skills. 

00:49:25
FRANK WILLS Absolutely. 

00:49:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So, you know I mean that’s the integration, I think isn’t it? 

00:49:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:49:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP It's where it's been… 

00:49:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:49:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …integrated on the person-centered feelings about psychological contact and things like that, you know that seems to me those are basic… 

00:49:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:49:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …things there. Umm… And I mean I… I find the, I mean the person-centered people if they are so isolated that they won't look at action… 

00:49:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:49:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …there and helping them, it’s not helpful to clients. 

00:49:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:49:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So… So it's (inaudible ), it's integrating to a certain extent I think isn’t it? Really, rather than this… 

00:50:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:50:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …sort of thing about. 

00:50:05
FRANK WILLS Having to do everything. 

00:50:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, integrating with… 

00:50:05
FRANK WILLS I mean, a term that sometimes used now which I… I find helpful actually is the idea was simulation because I believe, I… I think that’s a very good example that you… you have given and it's has been one of my major professional focuses in recent years, you know. To show that actually, of course you need to be at good interpersonal skills in cognitive therapy, if you… you know not you do very, very bad cognitive therapy, which is one of the worst experiences anyone could have I should think. 

00:50:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:50:35
FRANK WILLS You know, but that wasn’t really very clearly specified in the early models, but we’ve learnt you know from… 

00:50:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:50:45
FRANK WILLS …other sources and including Rogers, including interpersonal therapy and you know all sorts of things. So we’ve an answer to simulate ideas… 

00:50:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:50:55
FRANK WILLS …and… and round the practice out a lot I think you know. 

00:50:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:50:55
BRIGID PROCTOR I mean I think BACP has done a good job at that. I mean, there is the… like the new ethical framework where they have really spelt out basic principles, qualities and ah… What's it PQV, values… 

00:51:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP My values and principles, q’s… 

00:51:20
BRIGID PROCTOR …values, principles and qualities. 

00:51:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:51:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Which umm… we kind of all uh… raise our hand you know pay elegance to the flag where there is a flag that… that umm… we are now signing up to. I mean, we may not pay elegance to, but we sign up to it and it seems to me that the… that come out of whatever it is 30 years of really trying to find that common ground, the shared ground and umm… sometimes being a bit umm… collusive, I heard, I didn’t like the word collusive, but agreeing not to look at the differences. 

00:52:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:52:05
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah, yeah. 

00:52:05
BRIGID PROCTOR I think we also sometimes engage more strongly… 

00:52:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:52:10
BRIGID PROCTOR …about fairly strong differences. 

00:52:15
FRANK WILLS Good friends can argue. 

00:52:15
BRIGID PROCTOR That’s right. 

00:52:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

00:52:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:52:15
BRIGID PROCTOR It's been dodgy because we are such a broad… 

00:52:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:52:20
BRIGID PROCTOR …field really, but there is a core quality now I think of… of umm… values and beliefs. And that good training courses, I mean god knows what are good training courses now mainly there are, but certainly the… the BACP accredited training courses… 

00:52:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:40
BRIGID PROCTOR …do… do more than pay lip service to that common core of values, and then things aren’t used just indiscriminately. 

00:52:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:45
BRIGID PROCTOR And I think a lot would be people do as they get fairly descent training, you can’t go on the short course and you don’t just say, well I've been on the CBT short course I’ll use that. You know when I… the people that I’ve supervised links I’ve seen amusing that with intelligence and so, they really open to you know mind fields and all kinds of things that they might, I think in the old days people would just say hrrr… you know you mustn’t think of terrible, wicked evil stuff. They don’t do that now so much and there is a kind of, I mean I don’t know if there really is a greater intelligence, but it certainly it… it gives me the sense of there being a greater intelligence about how people incorporate new ideas and creative ideas into a practice, which in the end has got to be, I mean moderately founded if it’s a BACP course, I mean they… they do now, I mean that the… umm… the accesses, whatever they are do want to know, don’t they? If you call yourself integrative. 

00:53:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:53:55
BRIGID PROCTOR What is that you’re integrating and how? 

00:53:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP What is that you’re integrating and how do you integrate it? 

00:53:55
BRIGID PROCTOR And I think those questions… 

00:53:55
FRANK WILLS It seems a reasonable question I think. 

00:54:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:54:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

00:54:00
BRIGID PROCTOR They are asked, you know people are asked and have to give an answer for it. So, I… I think that there has been a movement towards a greater integration and a wider thinking. And I do agree that well, see I don’t know, I mean I still would like to know if the… if the research still seems to show, I'm told it does because I very seldom read research myself. But if… if… if it’s still does show that what work seems to be the… the person, you know the relationship between the person rather than whatever thing they think they’re doing. 

00:54:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:54:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Its more that what they think they’re doing and doing well, gives them confidence and a freedom to relate freely without worrying about what they’re doing, rather than what they’re doing that does it. So, I mean I… if that is still a same research, it's… it’s worth noting. 

00:55:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:55:00
BRIGID PROCTOR In… In the kind of answer to what you’re saying, because I agree with you too. I mean who could help but agree that somebody doesn’t want to be a (inaudible ) and… and when you become fascinated. 

00:55:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think it’s they’ve searched for an overarching theory… 

00:55:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:55:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …about well, it’s about change… 

00:55:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:55:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …and about what it… you know what happens, what are the things that really happen between people which helps them change? What are the, I mean arching theory in which more and more seems to be on that… however slight the relationship is, it is the relationship there which goes back a bit to the umm… the theory of attraction. But if you’re attracted from trustworthy… 

00:55:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:55:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …and seen as expert and the person will go with you. 

00:55:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:55:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Segan(ph) used to say you know sometime they’re swinging on the trapeze and if they experience you as in those qualities there, they’ll let go that trapeze and… and move. 

00:56:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:56:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And I think there’s a lot in that overarching theory somewhere there. 

00:56:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Well that’s interesting about the expert, isn’t it? That what you say, if somebody hasn’t… doesn’t give that confidence… 

00:56:10
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:56:15
BRIGID PROCTOR …of knowing their skill… 

00:56:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:56:15
BRIGID PROCTOR …then they won’t get the expertness that people… 

00:56:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:56:20
BRIGID PROCTOR …give, give some credit to, some trust to… trust to, it seems to know what he’s doing. 

00:56:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP But it’s also which skill for which person and you’re saying that, you know how, whether enough research has ever been done or will be done on how different personalities, different people. Different people are at different stages in their lives… 

00:56:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:56:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …presumably umm… response. 

00:56:45
FRANK WILLS I'm wondering if this is quite a good time to move into supervision as because we’re getting quite closer to supervision now and you’ve just mentioned that prejudice because in a sense there is no matter how well we train people and what coherence ideas we give them there are still the ongoing daily struggle to make sense of umm… you know peoples' lives and to work with… 

00:57:05
BRIGID PROCTOR To one of the 50. 

00:57:10
FRANK WILLS …find ways… working like… 

00:57:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:57:10
FRANK WILLS …and I… I… I thought just to add… add to that, the thing about 50 case aside and then I saw him and he probably Larry Beutler, he’s an American writer and… and he was playing with a similar idea to this and he said worked out and the people would have to be 80 before you are competent because they'd have to do so much work you know to be competent or things you had to be. And he was wondering how they would feel on finding out that they were now competence at 80, you know. Umm… That’s… that’s in a side, but the… but umm… so yes, yes… I’m… and really umm… supervision has been one of your major, major contributions and probably its what you’ve moved a bit more to over… 

00:57:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:57:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Since we retire or since after your retirement… 

00:57:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:57:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …we both took it up in a… in a big way really I became interested in it. 

00:58:05
FRANK WILLS So, one of you can start with umm… you know the… the fact that I’m… you know maybe a lot of our people watching this tape, maybe won’t realize this that umm… Britain is not exactly unique, but is certainly distinct in requiring those counselors being supervision certainly any counselors or members of their (inaudible ) in counseling and psychotherapy. Umm… So this is a requirement, but it’s not necessary in other countries, for example in America. 

00:58:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Or in America where a lot of our theories and things from counseling came from America, it is a requirement for students there, but not for what you’ve trained, but it ever soon has to… to student or counselor supervision. But I think there are some other European countries which require supervision, won't you? 

00:58:50
BRIGID PROCTOR I think there are now… 

00:58:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:58:55
BRIGID PROCTOR …but… but umm… it’s still unusual rather than usual, I mean I think Australia and New Zealand are probably doing that… 

00:59:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think they do, yeah. 

00:59:00
BRIGID PROCTOR …and I think they do that… But… but I think its still uh… its… it's certainly not universal for any manner of means. America is different because that… that they are students for much longer, I mean they’re much longer trainings uh… then they’re typically in England and they do see far more clients while they’re in training than… than most British people would. So ah… So they do have supervision over… over probably more clients… 

00:59:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP A lot of them. Yeah. 

00:59:35
BRIGID PROCTOR …in training, but they don’t have to have supervision or consultation. I mean whatever name you call it, supervision, consultation whatever, they don’t have to have it. 

00:59:45
FRANK WILLS So, why are they wrong with? 

00:59:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, I mean it’s… its constantly asked. It's been increasingly asked now. Do you… Do you wanna have a go at it first. 

00:59:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well, umm… its… its problematical for people who for instance yourself as a trainer, there you might see a few clients, there are the people who are training there you may see a few clients they don’t necessarily want supervision than hour and a half a month which you say mandatory thing of that. So there’s been a lot of discussion about how much experienced counselors need, do experienced counselors need to… should there be a much more free to you supervision when they need to. 

01:00:30
FRANK WILLS So you're telling about ongoing discussions in BACP? 

01:00:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

01:00:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:00:35
FRANK WILLS Yes. So what… what… 

01:00:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP It's still… It's still out. 

01:00:40
BRIGID PROCTOR I mean people were just say that’s it is… it’s a bit infantilizing and that there are loads of other ways of keeping your umm… personal, professional development going than through supervision. And… And… uh… we say, yes absolutely, certainly there are. And… I’m really dealing with the negative arguments, but it's like as supervisor-trainers and supervisors and leaders really in the supervision field, we are continuously being offended by the way that our professional organization use the street cred of being, we’re all in supervision using the street cred and have done nothing at all apart from accrediting supervisors who chose to go for accreditation to do anything about what training is happening for supervision or what… what umm… monitoring of supervision or anything is happening. And it seems to us that that is quite schizophrenic… 

01:01:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:01:45
BRIGID PROCTOR …really that uh… so… so that’s the… 

01:01:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Because one of the… I’ll say that, the strict is that you must go for supervision, but it doesn’t say who is supervisor has to be… 

01:01:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Has to be a counselor now I think… 

01:01:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Has to be a counselor now. 

01:01:55
BRIGID PROCTOR …for that different, different things that… 

01:02:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, but you see kind of still people go for a variety… 

01:02:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

01:02:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …of some people. And they are big things has been for a long time is that there is no regulation of supervisor courses. I mean, I think I was part of the group that set up the accreditation of counseling training, the diploma courses there and we wanted for a long time for a group to be set up. 

01:02:20
FRANK WILLS Accreditation process. 

01:02:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Supervision courses because people can be you know the courses can be very short, very long, different courses give certificates, diplomas, masters. 

01:02:35
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

01:02:35
BRIGID PROCTOR But more than that, I mean that’s the kind of functional, but the process more than that the process is that when BACP as it was then did set up umm… accredited courses, people had to talk about what they were doing and why they were doing it, otherwise there’s absolutely no incentive for them to get together expect for a few like we met on the train and have chat about it. There’s no people on though, you know people in any kind of training courses are actually rivals, they’re rivals for bumps on the seeds, the rivals for… for credibility and so on. So although they may pretend they’re not, there’s very little incentive to actually meet and talk and you get your good stuff pinched, you know we’re listening to this afternoon, they do the videos and things… 

01:03:20
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:03:25
BRIGID PROCTOR All that stuff things get pinched and everything, so there’s no incentive. But if BACP or something like that can get people together, then they have to talk, and if they have to think about some guidelines of what is good enough training, they have to engage with each other and fight sometimes about that and… and… and that is the way the good things sort of happened in… in professional association to happen, I think. Umm… But we still haven’t said what… 

01:03:55
FRANK WILLS What… What kind of it… 

01:03:55
BRIGID PROCTOR …we didn’t say the counselors. 

01:03:55
FRANK WILLS Take you back there because umm… I… I… I… You always say that I think that’s a good point about there may be different types of requirements and there should be a, perhaps a little bit flexibility. But I… I doubt that you would want to see a big variation and I will think you would still want to feel that the vast bulk of the profession was getting good, regular supervision. 

01:04:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:04:25
FRANK WILLS So… so why do you think that is that important? 

01:04:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well, it’s the only way and that people can really develop. I mean they can do it, they can reflect themselves and think about what they’re doing themselves from doing that, but it is used only in discussion without the people, I think that would people get that chance of developing and of looking, picking out their blind spots, finding out what’s different, what might be different for them. Umm… And somewhere, because again counseling is changing all the time and nobody knows still what really works, supervision is always opportunistic to work through and find out. 

01:05:10
BRIGID PROCTOR And a counselor, I think… I think the other thing is that I mean we know this is bad supervision and that’s why we’ve devoted so much of our time. And when we talk about supervision, when we kind of presume it good enough supervision in the terms that rethink of it of, which means that it’s a cooperative enterprise in which one person chooses to use their expertise in the service of another person, it might, the other person might do the same thing to them the next week. It could be a peer supervision, it isn’t that it's got to be expert student except in training, I mean busy training supervision has been different. We’re talking now about supervision of experienced counselors or more experienced counselors that if it’s the right kind of supervision, you’re giving somebody some sort of privileged access to the very private work that’s done in a room one-to-one and that no one else can have any access to, managers only have limited access to it. The supervisor is licensed to have a privileged access. So that there is somebody that… that the actual nitty-gritty of the work you know day-to-day can be talked about in… in security. And in a clear agreement that it's in the interest of the client, it comes out of it and we just think that people may be, in fact the more experienced people get the less they may reflect on their work, the less they may notice their blind spots. And the more stuck in their ways they make get and in the kind of supervision we advocate, we would hope that the supervisor was one that was… was very flexible, was, didn’t know what was going apart of the skills of supervisors and to know everything, but to know what’s going around, so they are some kind of window on the wider world. 

01:07:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:07:20
BRIGID PROCTOR As well as a unique sharer in a unique experience which is potentially, extremely abusive. 

01:07:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well that can say, that’s the other thing that’s sort of car wash… 

01:07:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:07:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …that people need really. And umm… I work quite a bit because I worked for East Sussex doing short-term counseling with any… anybody that worked in East Sussex, so I tend to get teachers and social workers sent to me. And I often think that the teachers if only they had supervision, they wouldn’t get so stressed and particularly if they hate send supervision well there the people would being to look much more the work they’re doing, they wouldn’t be so stressed and they wouldn’t you know that… that… That feels to me as why supervision is to way that. 

01:08:00
FRANK WILLS I think you're from Peter Hawkins' and Robin Shohet's analogy of the… the shower after work… 

01:08:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:08:05
FRANK WILLS …and something like that, do you? 

01:08:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:08:05
FRANK WILLS Well… Well getting to one of the really awkward issues there in supervision I think which is the issue about practice. Umm… Did you feel that our presence and methods of supervision you know can and do tackle that practice? 

01:08:25
BRIGID PROCTOR I think they can and I think they do. And I think there’s some bad practice that it doesn’t tackle. And I think that the fear of… I think the fear of bad practice makes bad supervision. That… That’s… 

01:08:40
FRANK WILLS Continue, it's something like… 

01:08:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah, it’s like to the extent that people become intimidated by people being sued, being complained against to their professional association umm… ah… doing damage to their clients, to the extent that one becomes intimidated by those possibilities to that extent, supervision will become less of a safe place for things to be discussed. So, I think it’s really… And time and again we used to discover in training supervisors that those uh… that… that… that kind of tricky issue would be raised, which of course it should be and discussed, but once it is discussed it becomes obsessional, the whole course gets taken over by. And I’ve seen this happen in our course, isn’t that? I have seen this happen in another peoples. 

01:09:40
FRANK WILLS Everyone goes home feeling bad, but not… but no one… no one is not… 

01:09:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, yes. Because there is a huge fear and it does need supervisors to think about in a very forthright and to be sufficiently intimidated, to really, I've thought about it and be continuously talking about, they’ll never stop it, no one will ever stop bad practice. There will always be bad practice. So, I think that the supervisors need to be helped to have a lot of courage, with more courage than I probably have about it. You know they need to be helped to have real courage about addressing these issues face-to-face. And knowing why, finding criteria for why, which we try to do don’t we in our… 

01:10:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:10:25
BRIGID PROCTOR …in our writings to try and to… Yeah, there is this checklist, you are looking at behavior that’s dangerous not people that are dangerous, but you know people that are working dangerously. How do you know? And I think it’s very tough and very difficult and I don’t want to be obsessed by it. 

01:10:40
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

01:10:45
BRIGID PROCTOR I refused that with the client. 

01:10:45
FRANK WILLS I guess it's time for us to just start moving to kind of conclusion of this interview. And, if is that we come a long way doesn’t it from 1973 when you were these scattered thoughts and you were feeling umm… like a bit junior in the profession, I think and got some. And so now, where you’re making a major contribution to developing this major area. So… So, how about… Can both of you make a sort of summary of that move? Umm… And you know what… what… And how you think that might go forward to (inaudible )? 

01:11:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think it might go forward now. 

01:11:25
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

01:11:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I don’t know, things are altering. There was an interesting article in umm… if you read it in the January, CPJ journal the… umm… by Nick. 

01:11:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Nick Totton! 

01:11:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Nick Totton yes, saying that he thinks that counseling has moved into two different areas, what he called the problem solving work, short-term work one between on that and the growth area. People that go into counseling for growth and that it… that it will be two… it will be two areas. I mean some people doing both, presumably but him seeing this as two things which don’t have the same name, which are not the same. I’m not sure how much that may be… that may be the way as it's moving. Umm… I mean one of the things I have seen grow a lot is the transpersonal area of counseling which you know seems to be an important area to which, it wasn’t there when we started. 

01:12:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

01:12:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP It wasn’t at all there. Perhaps I did training in psychosynthesis in 1990 and… and interested and then how umm… some of them umm… a lot of the values and things that we have may be a sort of new religion that people who can’t accept umm… the god religion in a… in a different jotted(ph), but may have assumption(ph) about how do you live your life, because that’s what counseling is about, isn’t it? How do we live? And how do I… How do I do what's right? You know and I think that’s umm… that being both in short-term work that’s as well there, but perhaps in the growth area that’s in more so people exploring that. And… And also of course, it's moving out into coaching areas. People making a lot of money in that area. 

01:13:30
FRANK WILLS I’m not sure whether you’re using as a good thing or a bad thing? 

01:13:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well, I think it’s a good thing because of the coaching it… it can be very helpful to some people and some people, yeah seems to be making it… Umm… I think the other thing that is problematical is that there’s not enough voluntary counseling, there’s not enough free counseling for people. 

01:13:45
FRANK WILLS Yes, yes. So finally, Brigid is there anything that you want to say? 

01:13:50
BRIGID PROCTOR (Inaudible ) you're listening to that such a lot of things. We’ve got 156 years between us that’s not practicing, but it’s… but… but it’s a good number of those practicing in some form, I suppose all but 40 of those years or 45 of those years spent in some form of working with people and it does going pretty different. And of course, why I guess on being different is because not only are people different, but the amazingly accelerated change in the… in the… the norms and values over those… those years we’ve been in the field, in the wider world. And I think that does bring up issues of economics I feel ah… furious, the lack of counseling services for people with long-term disability, illnesses and so on. Umm… I… I… I’m absolutely… I… I never… I never work much for money as a counselor and I was… I was I didn’t in a way because I had a… a salary, I didn’t need to. I’ve never wanted to be a predominantly private practitioner. I’ve real umm… worries about an economic system in which people have to pay £40 ah… for counseling. I think if it is personal development, I’ve always thought that there’s a whole area of counseling, it is a personal development enterprise. If people want to pay £40 for personal development, fine, but to call it psychotherapy, to call it… to call it something that is curing them and to go on for years, paying £40, £50 two or three times a week for instance, I’ve always objected to and it remains now. But if they wanna do it for personal development, fine. 

01:16:05
FRANK WILLS Brigid and Francesca, I think we’ve reached the… the kind of end of our allotted time here, which is a shame because I’ve really enjoyed talking to you and I feel that we could extend this… We could extend this a quite a lot more. But thank you very much. And you know on behalf of myself and the people are gonna be watching the tape for sharing your experience and your wisdom and knowledge with us, it has been really fascinating and I’ve learnt a lot as I’m sure everyone will so. Thank you once again. 

01:16:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Thank you, Frank. Thank you for giving us the opportunity.

NARRATOR The School of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice, we give critiques of the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples, in an informative but light-hearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series, in common with our other materials has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you are a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we'll have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we've got to offer.
