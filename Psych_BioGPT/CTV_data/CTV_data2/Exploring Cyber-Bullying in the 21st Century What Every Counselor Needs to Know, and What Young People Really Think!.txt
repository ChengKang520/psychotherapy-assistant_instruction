00:01:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Welcome. My name is Doctor Joshua Taylor. I'm a psychologist here in Southern California and today you're gonna meet some amazing people. They're gonna talk about what it's like to be cyber-bullied. They're gonna share their stories and offer some insight into what we can do as clinicians to better understand cyber-bullying. But also give us some tools, maybe some tricks, on how to treat it more effectively. You are gonna hear from young people who get good grades, young people who are athletes. You're gonna hear from young people who might not necessarily fit a typical bullyee role. But, non the less, they've been cyber-bullied. So, if you're working with young people, ask. 

00:01:55
COLE Hmm, when I was younger I kind of... I was short and a little chubbier and, um, a lot of the kids kinda picked on me so, like, I always got picked on for being... they would call me chubby or they would be like, 'You're fat, you shouldn't be swimming.' Cuz I was on the swim team. And, um, that's where it really all began. And then, um, once I got older, like, in the high school I started figuring out, like, who I really was and everything and, um, one of the high school students found a picture of me and, um, on the swim team with my, two of my friends at the time. And, um, he commented on it and he was like, 'Oh, look at the Emo boy now, now he's not even Emo, now he's just a fag.' That's what he said. He posted it on Facebook a lot. It got to the point where the... one of the boys that was in the picture with me, like, me and him used to be really good friends and then he started hanging out with the guy that was picking on me. So, that initially made it so we weren't friends any more. But it made it so bad where I had to delete my whole Facebook and start a new one. For me, like, since I live so far away from home I have to have that and since I have so many friends just travel the world that's the only way we can keep in touch. I know, like, older people really don't understand why it's such a big deal but to us it's like, that's how we keep in touch with everybody. It was terrifying for me cuz I was, like, when that started happening I was still really young and I didn't... I had just moved to where I lived and I, all I wanted to do was make friends. So, that really just kinda hurt. It was really scary. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know who I could talk to cuz my parents... I'd started talking to my parents and they just took me to a shrink. The first day I got there he sat me down and asked me some questions and I thought it was gonna be okay, like, I was actually gonna have an adult to talk to. And he brought out a bar, like, it had a light on it, like, it went back and forth and every time I had to go there he'd be like, like, he made me think of a happy place. And every time I'd start talking to him he would just bring out this bar and have me stare at it and go back and forth with the light and tell me to go to, go to my happy place. And that's all he did. I'm the type of person that likes to talk things out and for me not to have that, it was hard for me. I think that people just need other, like, people like them or like close friends or family members to talk to. And have somebody just there to listen to you and be open minded and not just assume things. I have really, two really good friends back home, hmm, once I finally came out to them, to being who I really am they really understood it and really just loved me for me and didn't care. So I could talk to them about anything and they just listened so that really helped me out a lot. 

00:04:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR When you think about relationships, particularly relationships that young people have nowadays they've really changed. Facebook, MySpace, uh, the internet, cell phones, they've changed the dynamic that young people live and operate in. It's become part of their culture. It's become part of who they are. And understanding that dynamic is very important, particularly when we start talking about an issue as, as new and as complex as cyber-bullying. Some of the young people that you're gonna hear from today have some incredible stories and the insight that they share on their world and what it's like for them and the relationships that they develop and how they develop. Having a Facebook account, having a cell phone is very important for these young men and women. It's part of their culture, it's part of who they are. I think the dynamic relationally has really changed over the last few years. Young people today, uh, live very much more in a virtual world than we ever did. They've grown up with that virtual world. They've, uh, immersed themselves in it and for them it's really part of who they are and I think it's important for us, as clinicians, to really understand that. But really understand that for young folks, uh, that virtual world is, is very powerful and permeable to who they are as individuals and as people. Cyber-bullying is any type of communication that happens either online through the internet or through the phone. And this type of communication can be demeaning, derogatory. Cyber-bullying is very much still being studied. It's not something that we have, I think, concrete definitions for. I think the best way to really understand cyber-bullying is to talk to the young people because they will each have a different experience in the digital realm and so one persons experience on the phone may be very different from another persons experience online. But they both, they both may be cyber-bullying. I think that if a person feels uncomfortable, threatened, if they feel that, uh, there's information that's being shared that they don't want shared, all of those things apply to this general term we use called cyber-bullying. When we think about young people and how attached they are to their cell phones, their internet account, I think it's important to understand that certain fundamentals about young people tend to remain constant throughout time. And what I'm talking about is, is Pierre Janet's initial theories on what makes a secure kid and early attachment theory. When we go back and we read these theories and we study them we find that the issues that make a secure kid haven't changed all that much. They need structure. They need love. And they need someone that's gonna be able to protect them. One of the things that I have found in talking with young people about cyber-bullying is there's a sense that no-one's going to protect them. That the bullying won't stop. And I think it's very important to convey this message that if they come forward and they talk to someone about it, that as clinicians, as educators, as parents, we're gonna do everything that we can to protect that young person. We want to be able to reassure them and I think that goes back to, uh, making sure that they're secure and safe. All of these issues that, that we've, as clinicians, have learned about over the years they haven't changed. I think they remain constant so I think it's important to educate our young people, educate parents, that a secure kid, uh, requires a lot of work. Uh, but the, the ingredients remain the same. If they get a healthy dose of, of structure and love and, and appropriate boundaries and, uh, they, they turn out okay. So why is it important to know about cyber-bullying? Well, we have more young people than ever, they're growing up in the digital age. Technologies gonna continue to advance. It's gonna continue to evolve, and as clinicians we have to evolve with it. Many years ago therapy was quite different. We did things in a different way. The people have become attached, uh, particularly young people, to the internet, to the cell phone, uh, to all kinds of technology. It really has permeated our life. So, I think it's important that as clinicians we have to adapt, we have to change with the times. We have to begin to use technology within our practice. We have to sit down with our, our young people and go on Facebook with them. Don't be afraid to engage them in that element of their world because I think that will convey a sense of interest and curiosity. From my point of view whenever I'm working with a client I always try to be curious. I find that if I'm curious about someone and their issues that they're gonna trust me and they're gonna open up and allow that therapeutic process to take place. Young people are no different. I think if we're curious about what's going on, we're curious about what's being said to them it gives us insight into what's going on with that issue, particularly with cyber-bullying, and allows us to be more effective as a clinician in our work. You're gonna hear from a young lady today who talks about cyber-bullying but also talks about how the cyber-bullying affected her cutting behavior. This is a very serious issue because cyber-bullying is comorbid with a lot of conditions. Depression, substance abuse, obsessive compulsive behaviors, self injuring behaviors. So, it's not so much why cyber-bullying but really more of how does cyber-bullying play a roll in many of the mental health issues that we tackle on a day-to-day basis. 

00:10:50
SHAYNA I've only really been cyber-bullied, um, that I know of, I've probably been like face to face bullied but it never really, it never clicked that it was bullying. But my first instance of cyber-bullying was with my boyfriend at the time and we had, like, a good face to face relationship but then any time we were on Facebook or on MSN he would tell me things like, 'Oh, you looked really fat today.' or like, 'You had a really big lunch.' Just like mean things that just, like, tore down my self-esteem. Made me feel really bad about myself. I'm generally, like, a really happy and loud and obnoxious person and when it started happening I just stopped hanging out with my other friends and I was just always, like, miserable. And, like, people did start noticing that and people would, like, blame my boyfriend for that and I'm just like, no, like, it's not him, like, it's just me, like, I guess I have issues or something. Facebook is my life, as it is, like, most teenagers, like, my family is all in a different country and so that's the only way I can contact with them cuz, like, we call sometimes but that's extremely expensive and my cell phone is always with me, it's always on. So, if someone says something to me I instantly get it. I don't know, if you get something instantly that's negative, like, it kind of just stops, like it, like, everything you're doing. But then, like, if you get something positive it just makes you feel better and then go on. And I think a lot of people think it's easier to ignore if it's online cuz you can just read it and go, okay, whatever. Like, it isn't at all easier to ignore. Like, I didn't tell my parents at all which I probably should of cuz they still like the guy but, um, I don't know. Like, I've told my best friends mom and, I don't know, she like, understood the situation but she also said okay, like, dump him or like, don't have him on Facebook or like, get rid of Facebook completely. Like, don't have him in your phone but it's so much harder to do. There's so many situations that you could just go, okay, do this and fix it but you can't. For me and like, any of my friends that have cut or are still cutting, like, at the time it's always, like, it helps you through everything and, like, after you might completely regret it but it's like your way of coping. And, like, just pushing yourself through. I feel like if I was never bullied I probably still would of cut and even if I had never cut I would still probably of been bullied. But I think the bullying, like, made it all worse cuz the cuttings the only way, the only thing that I really had control over and the only way that I could, like, as dumb as it sounds, like, make me feel better about myself. And so the cutting, I mean, the bullying definitely made the cutting worse. I mean I've had, like, one good counselor but the rest kind of just ignored and passed by the whole bullying subject. Every single one of them, except for the only one that I liked, they focused on, like, exercises and things for when I do feel down on myself. Which didn't help me at all. And, I don't know, or they would just, like, make me talk which I'm, like, I like the whole question and answer thing. Like, if someone just goes, okay, how are you feeling, I have nothing to say. So, that's what a lot of them did. And then a lot of them would make me feel like crap and then send me off. But then, like, the one good therapist, or good for me therapist, um, um, she would just ask me things and she would focus on a lot of the little things cuz I've never had something, like, traumatic but it was just all the little things in my life that just built up. I guess you need to know your patient before to make sure you know how they react but for me it works when they kind of go, it sounds like you're saying this, and you're like, yeah that's what I'm saying or no, that's not what I mean at all. So, they just need to, I don't know, kind of put words in my mouth and then I can tell them if they're completely off line or they get what I'm saying. So, that's what really worked for me and that I feel like therapists need more of. People need to know it's not always their fault and, like, it rarely is your fault for getting bullied. Like, online or face to face and, I don't know, you just need to hear that you're not doing anything wrong and that there isn't always something you can do to fix it, there's just only ways you can deal with it. 

00:16:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR If you're working with a teenage or young person who's being seen by you for depression or some other condition I would certainly ask them about being cyber-bullied. Most young people today have access to the internet. They certainly have access to things like Facebook or a cell phone so this is a very common problem. I think it's important that just as we do, uh, assessments for suicide and, and other issues that we should also talk about this concept of cyber-bullying. Another thing to consider is that cyber-bullying is not just going to be with a teenager. Cyber-bullying can happen at any age to someone is online. Whether that's with an internet account or with a cell phone. So, I don't want to leave the impression that it's only teenagers. Cyber-bullying can really happen to anyone who's online, even adults. Let's talk about current trends. Reality TV, violent video games, cyber-bullying, sexting. All of these issues tend to act as an accelerant to aggressive behavior. The longer a persons exposed to these types of traumas the more likely that they might be susceptible to anger types of issues. I think it's very important that when we work with young people that we have a much broader focus on issues that might be going on. Just because a young person comes in complaining of depression does not mean that they might have some other issue associated with cyber-bullying or injuring types of behaviors. We've talked a lot about young people who have been bullied but what about the young people who are the bully. It's very important that for these young people, that we model appropriate behavior. We don't wanna act aggressively or with anger because that's just gonna validate that what they're doing is okay. When I was a young man I was bullied at school and this happened on the playground, uh, pretty typical, bigger kid, little kid. I didn't have too much to worry about because it was just me and him and maybe a few other people at the school. I think it's quite different today. When you think of young people and they start talking about the, the idea of being bullied, the internet and cell phones make this concept happen on a much larger scale. It's not just them and that one person. It's them and everybody at the school or everybody in the town. This overwhelming sense, whether accurate or not, that everyone knows or everyone is involved. For a young person who's dealing with all of the stresses that young people deal with this can be pretty overwhelming. It's not just them and one other person. It's them and the rest of the world piling on top. In 2011 the University of California at Los Angeles, UCLA released a study and it talked about over 10 years that we've seen a general decrease in empathy among our young people. When we think about cyber-bullying and one of the ways that we need to address it, I think, it starts with us. It starts with us modeling appropriate behavior, modeling empathy and kindness to those around us. Young people don't come out, uh, as babies, bullying. They learn it. And they learn it from us. If we really wanna have a conversation about how we can address cyber-bullying I think it starts with us. 

00:19:45
JANA I have been cyber-bullied for a good portion of my later school years. I started getting cyber-bullied in Junior High and it took me a long time to realize that I was even being bullied. I was very active in school. I was always on the dance team and choir, ASB(ph). Always did honors classes, AP classes, got good grades, had lots of friends, great family, but I was still picked on. I remember in one instance, the very first time I can pin-point when I was bullied was I just changed schools in 8th grade. Just made dance team, was an ASB and I started getting messages via MySpace, at the time, saying awful things about how dare I go and be a dancer, I just got there and they started attacking the way I looked, the way I dressed and the way I acted. And I didn't talk to any of my friends about it cuz I was new at the school and didn't really want anyone to know that I was being picked on. So, I just kind of kept it to myself. It started getting worse so I talked to my mom and eventually blocked them and didn't have an issue with that person anymore. That person, I didn't know who they were, it was anonymous. You go through school and you start having, been picked on in little ways. Friends who comment on your pictures about how, ooh, that pose makes you look fat, or, that dress doesn't look good and those can be your friends so those are all still parts of being bullying and I didn't really realize that till I got older. Hmm, I went to two different high schools. My parents, when I was a junior in high school, opened up a charter in my home town. I transferred over to the charter. Was active in all the same things I'd been forever. Still cheer, dance, ASB, choir, AP classes, honors classes, getting the same grades, same type of friends. But when my parents opened the school we started getting bullied as a family on different blog posts. People talking about, there's no way my family could really be that happy, talking about the grades that I got. How I didn't earn them. If I got a part in a play I didn't deserve it cuz I was the Deans daughter. If I got an A I didn't deserve it because there's no way I should be in that class because I was the Deans daughter. So, it was really hard. They attacked me, they attacked my mom and my dad and my sister. My little brother was too, too little, he didn't get anything but they attacked our family as a unit. Eventually started going off to extended family if they knew them. So, it was just really hard on that form. We were picked on by adults and kids alike. It didn't matter who they were. I, it was really hard. It was really hard to watch these people who didn't know my family, didn't know anything about us, just attack us for just being who we were. So, I think it's really hard because in my experience I was bullied by people I didn't know, people I did know, adults, kids. I think that it's really important for people to realize that even if you're happy at school and you have good family and good friends you can still be bullied online. And I don't think people knew cuz I never showed it. I just kind of hid it underneath. But it really did affect me and even though I was always happy and I still did everything it was definitely hard to be ridiculed online all the time. I didn't tell anyone except for my mom and my dad when I was younger and then when I got older they were also being involved. But especially when I was younger in junior high I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want anyone to know. Because I was getting bullied this much and no-one knew I was so afraid that if I told even one friend that it would get worse. I figured if no-one knows and I'm getting this much I can handle that. If I start telling friends and it gets worse I don't know if I can handle it. So, I don't really know. For me personally, I don't think I changed very much to where they would know. It was more internally cuz my grades didn't suffer, I didn't stop participating so in my sense I think it'd be, it would have been really hard for them to know that I was going through so much online. It was really hard because, especially for me and my sister, we were so, so very much trying to not make a big deal about it. Especially once it got to the point where my parents were the principals of the school. I think we wanted so badly to just pretend like everything was okay. That there was a lot of times where we would never, if we knew who was saying it, we would never approach them, we just kinda took it because we didn't wanna cause any more problems. And being pseudo public figures in, which just sounds so silly to me, but to have everyone's eyes on you, even if you don't know it, I think we were so afraid if we reacted negatively or if we sought too much help that it would just get worse. And we didn't want our family to look weak so we just kind of took it. Which is sad but it's true. I had a friend of mine who got picked on through a cell phone. He had sent a picture to someone and this kid was not cool, not, not uncool, just kind of there. People kind of liked him, he kind of annoyed some people and he was always kind of bullied online. You kind of knew but no-one really wanted to say anything and he was a, a acquaintance of mine so I cared about him. But there's a point where he had sent a picture to a friend and then that picture got sent through, cuz someone thought it'd be funny to send it to everybody, and that went through the entire schools contacts and then once you thought it would be done with there was another picture with him, with like an animal on his shoulder, like he had a parrot put on his shoulder and that it was recent. And so I think in one instance that was one where he, I witnessed it, he told people, this is what happened to me and then you just watch it be rehashed over and over and everybody thought it was funny. And then I just watched him try to be so strong and that was hard cuz that wasn't internet, that was cell phones. And just when you thought it was over it'd be rehashed. There'd be one with him with a mustache drawn on his face and we'd go through so many people and so it was hard cuz that was a one where we all, for the people who were friends, just wanted it to disappear and there's nothing you can do. People just... and they all thought it was so funny, so funny. And it, I watched it ruin him for a little bit. He was strong. I think if it had been someone who was not so confident it could have destroyed them. Cuz that was, it was hard. It was really hard because you go through bullying in a personal sense and it could just be you and that one bully and the internet or on your cell phone. That one bully can send it to another person who can take that on and it could all happen really fast. One picture can be sent to a 100 contacts in less than two minutes and so that one bully that could have just said it face to face and that would've been a two minute thing scarred(ph) and then done can now go on to a 100 people in two minutes. And if the, one of, even one of those 100 people think it funny and send it to 25 of their contacts who send, one of those send it to another 25 that's twice, three, four times as many people that are now a part of this funny joke that's not funny. And it can be sent in five minutes to literally hundreds of people which sounds ridiculous and sounds impossible but it's not. Everyone has a coup, 200, 300, 600 contacts and if you think it's funny and you send it out, there you are. 200, 300 people are laughing at you before you even know it. That's hard. So it's a lot to take on. I really think the most important thing when you're talking to a student about being cyber-bullied is don't try to negate the importance to that student. It is earth shattering when someone's attacking you on your Facebook photos or it's really hard to just have them try and minimize what you're going through. So, to be open and honest and if you don't understand exactly what it feels like don't try to say that you understand. Just be there for them. Just talking helps. I think it'd be great for a counselor to go through those posts with you. Because it's one thing if you're telling them this is what happened or this is what so-and-so said but if you can sit down and show them, ok, this is what they're saying to me, this is how they're saying it. Some can be little mean comments, some can be real threats and I think if they have the opportunity to see it they could put themselves in those shoes as opposed to just word of mouth. I think, I think that would be great. I think that'd help the student or the young adult or whoever's going through it trust them too. Cuz then they would have allowed them to see that part of what they're struggling with.
