BILL O'HANLON Hi, this is Bill O'Hanlon and I am here today to introduce this videotape which shows solution-oriented treatment. This is a unique videotape because it shows several things that are quite unique. The first one is the combination of individual treatment and couples' treatment. Initially Christine who has a main presenting concern comes in for an individual consultation. During that consultation it emerges in the conversation that there are some difficulties with the couple that add into the presenting concern that she has. So we talk about the possibility of her coming -- returning in a few hours when her partner is available for a couple's consultation. So we will show you some excerpts from an individual session as well as some excerpts from the couple's session. What these sessions both have in common is a solution-orientated approach to therapy. What I mean by a solution-oriented approach is the focus in this approach is on listening to people's confidence, their strength and their solutions to their problems. Often people have resources and confidence and solutions and strength that they are not really attending to or they are not really focusing on when they are in the midst of their problem. Usually they are analyzing themselves, worrying about what it all means and they are looking in directions in which they don't have confidence. They are feeling stuck. So this approach gently tries to steer them towards the answers that they already have, the confidence that they already have to solve the problems and gently make suggestions in a collaborative way so that we can come up with new solutions. Perhaps some that they haven't tried before, perhaps some that they have tried before. The initial clips that you will see will be from the individual session. We will just take a few clips from that and show you the development of the solution-oriented interview and how Christine starts to get a sense that she can solve her own problem. Then we will transition into the couple's treatment in which we will show you a few more segments and show you that gentle process negotiating when there is more than one person in the room in a solution-oriented approach. Christine had - her main presenting concern was she was having what she called mini-breakdowns in the last while. After you see a little bit of the conversation, these may make a lot more sense to you as they start to make a lot more sense to Christine, she has had a lot of stresses and a lot of life changes in the last few years and she is feeling very overwhelmed. She has taken on a lot and she has been through a lot and these mini-breakdowns though are times when she doesn't function so well. Usually she is very highly functional and these bother her. So even though they make sense in this context, there is something that bothers her. So that's the focus of the treatment. And also the focus of the couple treatment initially is that some things that happen between the couples add into these mini-breakdowns and you will watch the process of how we start to intervene in those patterns, search for solution patterns and prevent those mini-breakdowns in terms of the individual work and in terms of the couples' work. The main themes that emerge during the individual meeting with Christine are that number one, she has had so many changes in the last couple of years and it might be a good idea to give herself a break and develop some compassion for herself. She tends to forget how much she is going through and how overwhelmed she is. When she's reminded of that, she is visibly relieved, she starts to treat herself a little more compassionately and think about herself a little more compassionately. The second theme that emerges pretty clearly is that she has very good ways to, as she calls it, get back on center, to get centered again, to get reconnected with herself and with other people who remind her that she is okay. So what you will now see are some excerpts from the individual meeting that I had with Christine. 

00:05:15
CHRISTINE I get off-center about once a week for the last month or so, I have been knocked off but since the holidays actually, I have been knocked off-center about once a week when I – and fortunately the way things are right now, I am able to take a day and get back on track but – and I never stopped functioning but sometimes I wonder how I am doing it. Sometimes I feel like the energizer rabbit that the batteries are just put in and I just keep moving. And I don't like feeling that way. I want to feel like – well, I call them mini-breakdowns. Self doubt is what enters the picture and I begin to wonder have I done the right thing, am I doing the right thing, am I going to be able to continue to do what I am doing. Now I have a very full plate. I am a lesbian. I came out three years ago, just about not quite three years ago. I was married for 26 years. I have two children. I have an 18 year old son who is just graduated from high school and he is looking for a job and doing all those wonderful 18-year old things. 

00:06:35
BILL O'HANLON Transition things. 

00:06:35
CHRISTINE Transition thing. I have a wonderful 13-year old daughter who is in the eighth grade that is just wonderful. So about 3 years ago, I left my husband, I came out, I started graduate school, I graduated from this institution in a year and a half with 60 units instead of the 48. I did very well and now I am in an internship and I love it. I really enjoy the internship. I have 8 clients. So my workload is just beginning to build. But now my ex-husband is out of work and I am living off my savings. So I feel a huge pressure to get a part-time job. The last three breakdowns as I call them, have occurred when my partner has said to me, do you think Peter can take the children for the weekend, and it's not his turn and it's my responsibility and I want to be with my children. And I have a huge struggle saying no, I want to be with my children. 

00:07:55
BILL O'HANLON How do you come out of these breakdowns because you say they only last a day or so and you have time to, given your schedule right now at this moment, you probably won't have time much longer but right now you have time. So how do you come out eventually of that phase, that mini-breakdown kind of thing that you call it? 

00:08:15
CHRISTINE This Tuesday was the most recent one and the way I came out of it, I climbed into bed and I knew that wasn't working. That was not going to do me any good and what is it going to help? 

00:08:25
BILL O'HANLON Have you tried it before, I mean and ... 

00:08:25
CHRISTINE Yeah, it used to work. 

00:08:30
BILL O'HANLON It used to work? It's not just a great coping mechanism anyway. 

00:08:30
CHRISTINE No, not a good coping mechanism anymore. So one of the things I do is swim. Swimming relieves the tension that I get up here. One of my cousins is in a difficult situation and so I have a photograph of him as a young child with us and our grandmother and I wanted to get that blown up and sent to him. So I went and did that. Being in touch with family helps. So I felt doing something for my family connection was helpful. So I am away at Kinko's to have this photograph blown up. I thought you know, I want to go pick up Hilary. It's her dance turn but I just want time with her in the car. I don't need to be at the center till 7. No, 5. I need to be here by 5. She gets out at 3:30. So I was at Kinko's, I called her dad and I said, look, I have got some free time. I will pick Hilary up and bring her to your house. So I went and got her and that brought me back. 

00:09:40
BILL O'HANLON Now that's an interesting thing. So, reconnecting with your family, your kids, your extended family. 

00:09:45
CHRISTINE They tell me I am okay. 

00:09:50
BILL O'HANLON Okay. That's a reconnection with okayness but it is also a reconnection to -- back. 

00:09:55
CHRISTINE Yeah. Also doing a laundry list of all the things I am dealing with now sometimes, many times helped because I go -- 

00:10:05
BILL O'HANLON Then you just have a little more compassion of course. Anybody -- and let's say if I had a client come into this situation, I would say -- 

00:10:10
CHRISTINE Exactly. 

00:10:10
BILL O'HANLON Mini-breakdowns? How come it isn't a major breakdown? 

00:10:15
CHRISTINE Exactly. 

00:10:15
BILL O'HANLON Whatever, a little more compassion for yourself. Okay, there is compassion, reconnection to family which gives you a sense of okayness. Okay. 

00:10:20
CHRISTINE We have trouble, it takes us a long time to reconnect after we have gone through one of these bouts. Because in talking to you, well, you give me some words, like about my okayness. Or if I said them and you gave them back to me, I am not sure which. 

00:10:45
BILL O'HANLON That's a first step. 

00:10:45
CHRISTINE It's been very hard for me to speak up for myself, and to get clear that this is what I want. I want my daughter here on the weekend. 

00:10:55
BILL O'HANLON You know what you want? 

00:10:55
CHRISTINE To speak up, to walk away if she is defensive, let her have her own things about it. This is unclear on what I want because the confrontation is really on what I have to do in those times when it turns into a fight. It feels like a brawl to me. And so what I do is, I say, this is only a fight. It's okay. This is only a fight. And the first time I did, I actually said it out loud. We were in the middle of a very loud conversation. It was like we were screaming in the alley. It just feels like it and I said, this is only a fight. She goes, yeah. I say, oh, okay, I can do this. 

00:11:35
BILL O'HANLON That was another – or another reminder that I would write on a card and that is, this doesn't mean the end of the relationship. 

00:11:45
CHRISTINE Yeah. 

00:11:45
BILL O'HANLON This doesn't mean she is going to go away. 

00:11:45
CHRISTINE Yeah. 

00:11:50
BILL O'HANLON Well, she may go but it doesn't mean that right at this moment. 

00:11:50
CHRISTINE At the moment. 

00:11:50
BILL O'HANLON I think that's a good reminder but would it be useful do you think to come back with the two of you or is this enough? 

00:12:00
CHRISTINE I think it would be very useful. 

00:12:00
BILL O'HANLON Great. 

00:12:00
CHRISTINE Because there are some things as you were talking that I don't really know what Amy is thinking or what's going on with her. I think it would be very useful. 

00:12:10
BILL O'HANLON Okay. 

00:12:10
[sil.] 

00:12:15
BILL O'HANLON Several hours later, Christine returns with her partner Amy. We meet for about an hour and you will be seeing some excerpts from that hour-long video. Initially we focus on why the couple is there and the presenting concern that Christine had and how this couple's work might focus on that same problem. 

00:12:40
BILL O'HANLON Christine said there were some moments in the last month given that this is a very recent, sort of, shift that makes a little more sense, but some moments in the last month where she just, she has probably said she would have mini-breakdowns, she just freaked, basically and got discombobulated, off-center. We talked about some ways that she could on her own regardless of what's happening out in the world, review, get back to center, she has got a list of things now, she will never get off-center again, she's totally -- 

00:13:20
AMY Excellent. 

00:13:20
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that's right. But actually it seems like she has got some pretty good plans and pretty good prevention things in place but that's just not going to happen in the same way, hopefully or not as much definitely. That's fine. Now what we talked about the two of you coming in, maybe we can even do some prevention so that in the relationship between the two of you, those moments don't, you don't even get invited to getting off-center in the same way, or you don't get into whatever reaction to her stuff or she doesn't get into a reaction to your stuff or whatever in the same way, so that's why we thought maybe meeting together would be a good thing. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:05
BILL O'HANLON In the clips that follow, you will be seeing some general solution-oriented strategies for working with couples. In order to help you understand what you see in this tape, we will do two things. One is, I will just introduce some general concepts and methods and the second thing is, when you see the clips, we will put some titles on them that will help you understand and recognize which one of these particular methods or strategies is being used right at this moment. The first one is, that I do a lot of and you will hear summarizing, validating and softening. 

00:14:40
Summarize, validate 

00:14:40
and soften 

00:14:40
BILL O'HANLON Sometimes when couples are in the office together, there is some blaming, some discouragement that happens and what I like to do is summarize what we have talked about so far and validate each person's feelings and points of view without deciding which one is right or wrong and then soften things a little, either create some openings or possibilities or maybe give it a little less harsh interpretation or a little less discouraging interpretation. So you will hear me doing that again and again while I turn to both of them or one of them and speak for them sometimes and summarize what we have talked about so far or what the other person has just said but in a little softer way, in a way that validates each person, doesn't take sides in any particular way but softens things just a little, helps them empathize with one another just a little better. The second method or strategy is that I use a lot of self-disclosure. 

00:15:35
Self-disclosure/ 

00:15:35
storytelling 

00:15:35
BILL O'HANLON I do a lot of story-telling as well as self-disclosure. Some of the stories are about me, some of the stories are about other people that I know. So that's – in some traditions, that's quite common, in some traditions, that's not. Why I use self-disclosure and story-telling is I think it normalizes, it lets couples know that they are not so alone and so unusual or unique or strange or weird or wrong. It sometimes suggests some solutions or possibilities that they hadn't – that hadn't occurred to them and sometimes this gives them an understanding that I understand where they are and what they are going through. They nod quite a bit while I am telling stories, while I am doing self-disclosure, it also equalizes a relationship a bit more. Yes, me too. I have had these kind of struggles, you are having these struggles now. It's not me the expert therapist who never has any problems and you down here, the screwed-up, messed-up pathological clients. So it does a little of that equalizing. Obviously there is still some imbalance there but I find it that people really appreciate it. Sometimes people go away and the only thing they remember are the stories. They come back and they tell me, oh, that story you told was really – they can't remember otherwise the content or the process of what we are going through. So it also seems to weigh up certain pegs, certain ideas or make them memorable or make them easier to use out in the world. 

00:16:55
Identifying and tracking 

00:16:55
problem patterns 

00:16:55
BILL O'HANLON The third method that you will see again and again is I really do attend to the problem patterns. I try and find out what are they complaining about, focus on that and get them to detail it and we will talk about detailing in a couple of minutes but first, just identify when they are talking about problems, what do you mean, I don't understand what it's like for you in your life so tell me what it's like, what it looks like, what it sounds like, how it is for you, how it feels for you, how you perceive it.Soon after that or right in conjunction with that, I like to identify and track solution patterns, finding out how does it go better, how does it go differently, how does that fight in, how do you warm up to each other after you have been cold with one another, how do you come back together after it has been distant, how do you end an argument rather than how does one start or how does one go. 

00:17:45
Identifying and tracking 

00:17:45
solution patterns 

00:17:45
BILL O'HANLON So those are solution patterns. Usually I am searching in the past for things that have gone a little better and especially what anybody can do about that. Sometimes we can't identify solutions to the past, they can't remember anything right at the moment that's worked or nothing particular has worked. So I suggest some possibilities from my own experience, from my own knowledge. I suggest those in a tentative way so that I don't impose them on people but I certainly have ideas. 

00:18:10
Suggesting possibilities 

00:18:10
BILL O'HANLON And I suggest those to people usually again in the form of stories, sometimes not in the form of stories, sometimes as a direct suggestion. I think it is important in this instant to be more tentative in your suggestions rather than this is the way you have to do it. This is the task that you will have to do, this is the lifestyle that you have to choose, that you will have to live. These are just suggestions rather than orders or ways to live or the true values by which to operate in your life or your relationship. 

00:18:45
Getting specific/action- 

00:18:45
descriptions/videotalk 

00:18:45
BILL O'HANLON The last one is getting specific or what I sometimes call getting action descriptions or using video talk. I want to find out what it looks like and sounds like because if a client comes in and says, I am under a lot of stress and I am thinking, stress , yes, I know what that means, that's my stress that I am going to be dealing with. I need to find out what stress looks like and sounds like to them or I am going to be projecting my own ideas onto their words and I am maybe going to be working on my own problems with them. So I want them to teach me and I really even sometimes use that word, teach me what it looks like, what it sounds like, how you do stress, how it feels to you, what circumstances it happens in, getting very specific. Often to do that, I will say, give me a specific example of some time when this happened between the two of you, if it is a couple situation, if it's an individual situation, some time when this happened, and I will use this with problem patterns and solution patterns. Tell me what it looks like when this has happened, when there has been a problem. Tell me when it looks like and sounds like when this has happened and it has been helpful. So you will find a lot of that tracking of problems and solutions combined with getting specific action descriptions. Now let's look at some excerpts from this couples' tape, okay and in about an hour you are going to be seeing some shorter excerpts that will illustrate the main points that we have just covered. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:05
Identifying and tracking 

00:20:05
problem patterns 

00:20:05
CHRISTINE I told Bill that basically I have noticed that the last three times that I have gone into my mini crisis has been when you have challenged me about the kids, when you have wanted it to be different around the children and my, first of all, being very unclear about that myself, feeling like I should get rid of the children and anger coming up and my not realising that it was anger and not wanting to fight, not wanting to confront you, not wanting to say, no, that's not the way I want it to be, and then I get very ashamed of how I am acting. 

00:20:50
AMY In terms of the children or in terms of the way you are interacting? 

00:20:55
CHRISTINE I think at the moment, reacting and withdrawing 

00:21:00
AMY Oh, okay. 

00:21:00
BILL O'HANLON Or you are now withdrawing, coming and feeling this tension between the two of you, or you call it a glass wall or sometimes like there is this thing that has come between the two of you that neither of you like, you certainly don't like, and you certainly don't like and I assume that you don't like it either. 

00:21:15
AMY No, and I know when the line is crossed, I know when she goes into that place and then I spend like two days trying to unring the bell and there is no way to do it and there is just no way to do it and it's not like I can say, okay, it's time for you to stop feeling like that and now be like this because I have been in the same place where she has done something that has pissed me off and I have gone into a place where I just cannot... 

00:21:35
BILL O'HANLON You are not very available for the next couple of days or couple of hours or -- 

00:21:35
AMY Yeah, however long it takes but sometimes it takes much longer than I even think it should and I am Amy, for God's sakes snap out of this but then in the very next moment, I will turn around and it's a little more difficult, I think, for me to be direct and I tend to sort of act out in ways that or trying to get the same point across but I can't communicate it that way so what I do is, I use the very mature things like sarcasm and digs and you know, and that's more (inaudible ). 

00:22:10
BILL O'HANLON Get the love and the concern and the – that's here across. 

00:22:15
AMY Exactly. 

00:22:15
CHRISTINE And the sarcasm really feeds the self-doubt for me. 

00:22:20
BILL O'HANLON So that's what she says, she goes into self-doubt like, oh, maybe I am all screwed up and I am wrong and this is all my – you know, I am making just something bad here and whatever and that doesn't help to close this any or the resolution -- any, it just gets her into a weird out place. And so... 

00:22:35
AMY Which is really hard to penetrate. It's very -- 

00:22:40
BILL O'HANLON But I wonder between the two of you, examining two more things then. One is, what you could do with that moment even if she is not back to center to invite her back into center, invite her back into the relationship, what you could do, we'll find out about that. 

00:22:55
AMY Threats, maybe. 

00:22:55
BILL O'HANLON Threats, I think it's threats, added to the sarcasm, threats I think would be good. I think that could work but maybe we will find some other things. So what you could do at that moment and what you two have found in your relationship that pulls you through those moments and once we find what it is, maybe doing it more deliberately because it happens after two days or three days or whatever of alienation or the glass wall, something melts and you find a connection. 

00:23:30
AMY I think we start missing each other is what happens. 

00:23:30
CHRISTINE Yeah. 

00:23:30
BILL O'HANLON Okay but that's fine and that's why it happens and then I would want to find out how it happens. Once you start missing each other, what are the moves that each of you make, what are the responses that each of you give and then see if we can import those a couple of days earlier. That would be nice. So let's just go to that mode because I think that's a nice place to start. It's a weared-out time between the two of you, whoever started it, whoever has gone weared-out, it doesn't matter. Now it is coming back together, it's a couple of days later, it's a couple of hours later, it's minutes later, whatever it is, a day later, you are starting to come back together, I want to hear a couple of those incidents in which the tension is dissolving and you are reconnecting in a way that both of you like. What happens, not why does it happen, when you see each other, what happens. Who says what, how does the other person respond, there may be different things, there may be two or three things that typically happen but I want to find out sort of a typical happens, who says what, how do you come back together, like in my relationship, one of us reaches over and just touches the other one on the arm, something -- it's just like a little bit of contact like we were talking today. I don't think you are the lowest, paleolithic pond slime there, good to have it in the earth, that thing. The little touch saying, you know, I am reaching out a little here. If the other person says, like, what, that doesn't facilitate it. The other person goes okay, or at least doesn't pull away there is a little opening there. So what happens in those moments, if you can bring it back to those moments when things are going there, when things start to melt between the two of you, the tension starts to dissolve, the closeness starts to come back, when you miss each other, when it is starting to thaw between you. 

00:25:20
AMY I have some examples. 

00:25:20
CHRISTINE I can only think of one. Go ahead. 

00:25:25
AMY When I said, stop it, you are getting very ugly. That one. 

00:25:30
CHRISTINE Yeah. 

00:25:30
AMY So a little humor is actually -- 

00:25:30
BILL O'HANLON Sometimes that's the difference I want to find out. Sarcastic stuff, it's cutting, it's not so great. Sometimes when you are kind of like, ooff, you both get it back to that, oh, we can joke about this and it is okay. 

00:25:45
AMY Yeah, that important. I know that one of the other things that when it begins to thaw is usually phone contact. For some reason, if we have separated and I have gone somewhere, she has stayed there, she went somewhere, and I stayed there, we both went to different places, then if we talk on the phone like when you went to Laguna Beach, then -- if we are around different people, completely different world, like she went down and was with her family for a day and then I got a phone call, you know, and it was -- the ice had melted, in a different environment. 

00:26:20
BILL O'HANLON And because she is in a different place and also she calls up and somehow it is not in the same environment where the phone contact makes it easier to build that bridge again, just connect again. 

00:26:30
AMY So you run down downstairs and call me from my phone. 

00:26:35
BILL O'HANLON That's what I was going to say. It's like -- 

00:26:35
AMY We have two lines. We have to talk on the phone. 

00:26:35
BILL O'HANLON We have had couples that have done this. They say – I say, when was your best conversation, they go, well, when one of us was on a trip and the other one calls back, we have the greatest conversation like, other times we sit around here like sloths watching TV and we don't interact and then we go on a trip and we have these wonderful romantic close sharing conversations, so why not? I am really serious about this. You may think I am joking but I think that's right. It's like figure out what works and then do it in whatever creative ways you can quicker to melt the ice. So that's one thing to try. It may work, it may not. I don't think it gets a distinction between the sarcastic humor and the good humor that breaks the ice and I have the same thing because I can be very cutting with my humor when I am hurt or upset or whatever and I also can have a really wonderfully undermining of all the seriousness and it's hard for me to find the difference. I cannot actually -- 

00:27:30
AMY Usually there – we were talking about – it totally makes me laugh, we were talking about something that -- she was talking about her type and she said well, it's like Candice Bergen, she just like thinks that Candice Bergen is the hottest thing in the world. Candice, you are welcome, if you are watching this, learning, and so I said well, and we kind of got into a competitive place around it and I think it could have gone somewhere but then I said, well, I look like Candice Bergen and she goes, wait, now you do. And I got hysterical because it was just hilarious and I couldn't be threatened anymore. 

00:28:15
BILL O'HANLON Hold on to that. 

00:28:15
AMY And then another point we got into a tiff about something, she was making her point and you know, up on her soap box(ph) you know and something I said, oh stop it, you are getting very ugly. When you talk about that, that -- 

00:28:35
CHRISTINE No, you turned like, you just went sshhh, you are getting very ugly. 

00:28:40
BILL O'HANLON That's right. 

00:28:40
AMY And we got hysterical. 

00:28:40
CHRISTINE It was very endearing. It was that touch. 

00:28:40
BILL O'HANLON There was the touch, yes. 

00:28:45
CHRISTINE It was very endearing. It was cute. It was not – it was just sshhh. It was very gentle because Amy can get loud. 

00:28:50
AMY The sarcastic thing is a totally different feel and it is a completely different intangible edge that comes across and part of what it is, is -- and I know that I do it and I am busting myself doing it after having been busted by somebody else who called me on it but it was about – it is about an edge that comes through that is – can either be sort of a jest thing but it's very cutting so that I can say I was kidding. You know what I mean and it's like you don't have to own it. You can still hurt the other person but you don't have to own it. 

00:29:25
BILL O'HANLON Right. And so I mean, it's different energy for you but how it comes across to you is one of the ways it softens the heart is, it could have been there with that saying, I mean, the person who says because the touching, the voice tone. 

00:29:40
CHRISTINE Yes, the voice tone. 

00:29:45
BILL O'HANLON The touch and the voice tone and then we were joking about in one of my relationships the person had a tendency to withdraw. I don't know why but it seemed to – I didn't realize this until after this change happened but I must have been absolutely terrified that she was going to leave me and so she reaches over during one argument and just touches me on the leg and I'll tell you it was like, ooofff. The whole thing. That's what I am telling you. It's just like, she doesn't think I am terrible and she is not going to leave me today right now. And it was that touch that softened it. Nothing else. I mean, she is still pissed at me and I really didn't like what you did and real – we are still arguing about it. There is this underlying thing and that's what you are talking about. I mean some primitive thing is saying, she is going to leave me, she is going to go away. Not even she is going to leave me, she is going to go away. She is going to disappear from the universe. I don't know what, it's just primitive like, cellular feeling thing. I don't know what it is but it's like, "aagghh". Then you get more defensive and freaked out. So it's that physical touch, if it is not again done in anger like that, the voice tone somehow, reassurance saying, I am pissed and I still love you and I am still going to be with you, that would help today. 

00:31:00
CHRISTINE That helps a lot. 

00:31:00
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that. 

00:31:05
CHRISTINE No, saying I love you and I was really mad at you but I am not going away. 

00:31:10
BILL O'HANLON So that could be great. Could you say that now? 

00:31:10
AMY Yeah, if I didn't think I was going to go away. 

00:31:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, well, so I am not planning on leaving the relationship today. 

00:31:20
AMY At this time, when I go to the store. 

00:31:20
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that's right. 

00:31:25
AMY I will come back. 

00:31:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that's right. But when I go out to run an errand maybe, I am really pissed at you this isn't finished and I am not going to – I am not planning on going away and separate the relationship at this moment. Maybe in an hour, maybe, you know, in a day, maybe a month, who knows but not right now. I am pissed. I really don't like what's going on. I don't like what you are doing, I don't like what's going on and I don't intend to leave the relationship. That would be very reassuring. 

00:31:50
AMY Is that what you are saying? That somebody is going to leave? 

00:31:50
CHRISTINE I think on some level. 

00:31:55
BILL O'HANLON Some primitive – that's what we were talking about today. She said, I think she is going to go away. 

00:32:00
AMY You know what's interesting, I don't think that, at least on a contrast level, I am not sure that that's what goes on in my head. 

00:32:05
BILL O'HANLON Well, probably not. 

00:32:05
AMY What goes on in my head is, oh, my God, you are never going to leave me and I am going to be trapped forever and ever and ever. 

00:32:15
BILL O'HANLON This is going to go on and you are going to (inaudible ). It is going to repeat again and again. This is my hell. 

00:32:20
AMY Yes, exactly. This is going to be what it is going to be forever. 

00:32:20
CHRISTINE That's when it works best and it's happened on two occasions where I have finally gotten angry enough that I have left and it's much easier for me to leave. 

00:32:30
BILL O'HANLON She is very reassured by that. But if you left, she would be more affected. 

00:32:40
CHRISTINE Yeah, I get -- 

00:32:40
(crosstalk) 

00:32:40
CHRISTINE Except for the time I put everything in a bag and threw it out and told her to get out. That was kind of a -- 

00:32:45
AMY In a garbage bag. 

00:32:50
BILL O'HANLON That's very classic. 

00:32:50
CHRISTINE That's interesting. I hadn't thought about that because I know you don't -- 

00:32:55
AMY The fact that all my clothes fit into it was the sorry thing. 

00:33:00
BILL O'HANLON That was really sad, very sad. Alright go ahead. 

00:33:00
CHRISTINE But I -- yeah, I would be very reassured because I was telling Bill today that many times – well, I am not used to fighting. You know, Peter and I never fought and my mother and I never fought and I just... 

00:33:15
BILL O'HANLON This is new stuff. 

00:33:20
CHRISTINE This is completely new for me. 

00:33:20
AMY You are a lesbian now, honey. This is the way it is. 

00:33:25
(crosstalk) 

00:33:25
AMY Cancel that. 

00:33:30
CHRISTINE But it – so fighting is just so --. 

00:33:30
BILL O'HANLON She is your partner now. That's the way it is. That's it. I mean it really is that. You find two people like who were fight-avoidant, like you and Peter, you are lesbians, you can find two people that were at it all the time. It's just different people. But I think she is adjusting quite well to the new fighting thing in relationship, generally. I mean, I think more people would be more freaked out having come from a background, no fighting in their childhood, no fighting in their marriage and all of a sudden they get into a relationship and it's like this person likes to get in there and sort it out. 

00:34:05
CHRISTINE I mean, even as a child, I was the only child at home. So I didn't even have siblings to wrestle with. 

00:34:15
BILL O'HANLON To torture you and bother you. 

00:34:15
AMY That would be in our apartment. 

00:34:20
CHRISTINE Exactly. And she was tortured all the time. And I enjoy that partly a bit. 

00:34:20
BILL O'HANLON You are really helping her learn this one. 

00:34:25
(crosstalk) 

00:34:25
CHRISTINE Do you remember one time when we got into a really – I thought it was the end of the world and we were fighting and it was probably – I remember I stopped and I said, we are just fighting, remember that? 

00:34:35
AMY Yeah. 

00:34:35
CHRISTINE And so I have to remind myself – yeah. 

00:34:40
BILL O'HANLON Such a revelation for her, like this is just a fight. Alright, but if she said to you during the middle of a really tough time, look, I promise you if this continues for a really long time, I will leave the relationship, would that reassure you? 

00:34:55
AMY I think so. I mean I think that I would be afraid that – because I think what happened in my last relationship was, we stayed a year too long and oh, my God, what a nightmare. 

00:35:10
BILL O'HANLON You just beat it to death. 

00:35:10
AMY Yeah, we just beat that, the horse was rotten, it was decomposing and we were just beating it. 

00:35:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. So you want to make sure that doesn't happen again. That's one of your fears. You are not so – I mean, you are not so afraid, I mean I am sure you wouldn't want to be left but you are not so terrified about that like she might seem. 

00:35:25
AMY I also don't want to – not that I have got the power to do it. I mean, I know that she is certainly capable of taking care of herself but I know that in the last relationship I think we did a lot of painful stuff around – not that I can like damage Christine but I mean if it is getting to a place where it is just destructive on either part, I don't want to do that. I mean, Christine is my friend. If the lover part doesn't work out, then let's go somewhere else and be friends again. 

00:35:50
BILL O'HANLON You are not hurting each other so much. 

00:35:50
AMY Yeah. 

00:35:50
BILL O'HANLON So do you promise if you were clear that it is getting to that place and that you recognize that and you recognize that and you will say, ah, no more of this? 

00:36:05
CHRISTINE Oh, I – it's interesting you could say that because the last two times when I left and went to Laguna, that's what I had in the back of my mind. And I thought that she was afraid I might do that because that's what I would think. And it's surprising to find out that wouldn't bother you. 

00:36:20
BILL O'HANLON Well, not that it wouldn't bother her. I think that's an overstatement. 

00:36:25
AMY Of course it would bother me. 

00:36:25
BILL O'HANLON But to say that she wouldn't want to – if it were really clear that it was going on a bad path and it was continuing down a bad path and it was going to go worse, she would want to make sure that you were willing to give up and she was willing to give up and then maybe you could salvage some sort of friendship out of it and you wouldn't just let the horse decompose when you kicked it for a while and do some damage to either one or both of you. 

00:36:45
CHRISTINE I think it is pretty clear I don't do that because here I had this 26-year marriage and then in the last year when I got sober and it got – so we were fighting and it was horrible and I just did not want to tell him why we were fighting, it got to a horrible point where I had to tell him because I wasn't going to let it go on. It was damaging both of us. 

00:37:10
BILL O'HANLON So she is saying she has got that ability to recognize it when it's – and she will accept that. 

00:37:15
AMY Yeah, and I think that there is a part of me that does trust that and there is a part of me that truly does trust that and knows that. 

00:37:20
BILL O'HANLON What if you hear it in that moment, if you are freaked out, like it would be important for her to hear I am not going away today or not, you are just hearing it in here and would it be good enough for you? 

00:37:30
AMY Yeah, I think because I think I have always believed that. 

00:37:30
BILL O'HANLON But it's good to just say that -- 

00:37:35
AMY 'Coz she has a trust in a whole like, different system that's greater than all of us and I do too. I mean, I – and I know that there is a whole sort of grander scheme of things and it is going to turn out the way it turns out really regardless of what... 

00:37:50
BILL O'HANLON And she is not going to let herself go into a major dysfunction by any case, she was already there, she lived there for a while, no thanks, I don't want to do it again so if it gets that bad, she is not going to let the horse decompose. 

00:38:00
CHRISTINE No. 

00:38:00
BILL O'HANLON But at that moment when she is in this bad place, a couple of things so far that I can hear, three things. One is, I am not sure, I think if it is softened by touch and a voice tone, that might be it. Second one is, a little distance. Either the telephone distance from upstairs to downstairs, using your phone to call the other, you know, the husband. And then – or physical distance like going to see your sister in Laguna or whatever and then the third thing would be some reassurance coming your way, physical touch would be part of it but also just saying, look, you know, I am really pissed and I am not leaving you right now, I am not breaking up the relationship, I am not going away. Those are three things so far that could shorten the time on that sense of alienation and the tension between two of you, the glass wall that you describe it, I don't know how you describe it. 

00:39:00
AMY I think also meanwhile we have got this can of worms opened, I think what would help for me is to know that it is okay to separate for that day because sometimes I begin to feel really confined when we are fighting and fighting and fighting and it's going nowhere and I know that, you know, a lot of times you will say to me, I want to just go for either a run or I am going to play golf or I am going to go somewhere that takes me out for three or four hours, well, running doesn't but like, go and play golf with somebody different, you know, just talk about something different and Christine will sometimes want to resolve it, resolve it, resolve it and we are just – we are not in the mindset to do it. 

00:39:50
CHRISTINE Yeah, that's true. 

00:39:50
BILL O'HANLON So, what's the code word for that? I mean I have had some people just say time out where to that place where it seems to be a war over and over again, do you agree? 

00:40:00
AMY And for me to be able to go and play golf or separate or for her to go away and do whatever she needs to do, she – I have an abandonment thing, I have an abandoning thing and I feel like I need to say I am going to play golf and I am going to get out for the day and you can go and do what you want to do but I am not abandoning the relationship. I am not abandoning this issue. I just need to go away and come back. 

00:40:20
BILL O'HANLON You will be much better that -- because when she went out to run and you say, are you going to avoid this or are you – because you need to run and sort of both but if you say, at the end of that and I will be back and maybe if we are in a better place, we can finish this. Is that okay with you? 

00:40:40
CHRISTINE Right, because I do want to resolve it. I want to – you know, and it's not being resolved, it takes me a while to figure that out. What I don't want you to do is go and have fun. This is serious. You are supposed to be working with this. 

00:40:50
AMY I rest my point. 

00:40:55
BILL O'HANLON You may have noticed already and you may notice in this next segment that you will see that I talk a great deal and when I do couples therapy especially, when I do individual therapy, I talk a fair amount and sometimes people have commented, I think, watched my tape so they seem to do demonstrations and workshops or people that I train. Boy, you talk a lot and I was trained not to talk, you know, just listen and let the people talk. For me, there is a couple of points to this. One is, I like the conversation to be collaborative and for me, collaborative conversation is both of us talk a fair amount. They talk, I talk, they are talking and listening, it's not just a one-way conversation. That's the first point. The second point is that, sometimes when couples, initially the way I learned couples' therapy is just let people tell each other their feelings and points of view and turn to each other and talk. I found early on that they could share their feelings a lot and it didn't necessarily solve the problem. They could turn to each other and talk quite a bit. I typically talk quite a bit when I see that they painted themselves into a corner in some way. They have backed themselves into a corner, it looks like one of them is really getting discouraged or one of them is blaming or both of them are blaming or getting discouraged, now I find myself talking quite a bit, trying to create a reality. So I think that traditional therapy says, let's get to what's really going on with clients. In this approach, I am trying to change what's going on with clients while I am asking about it. So you will hear me seeing some possibilities, telling some stories, and by the time they answer the question that I have, it's going to be a slightly different answer than they would have given. So I am both shaping what they are saying and I am hearing what they are saying and helping them articulate what they are saying but it's not like I am truly discovering. I don't think you can ever truly discover what's going on with people. You are always getting approximations and you are always going to be around influencing it. So I am going to try and influence it of course in the direction of solutions and possibilities and not blaming and not getting into this idea that change is impossible and that this person will never change or our relationship will never change. So I am doing a great deal of talking especially in this next segment that you will see. Another thing that I typically do is, while I am talking, I am watching them very very carefully. They are nodding in some places, they are shaking their heads in other places, they are frowning in other places and I am getting a sense, is this right, is this right, is this coming across, is this helpful to you so I am reading the non-verbal comments that they are making on what I am saying and adjusting it as I go and I think that's a very important thing. If you just go off on your own and talk about what you're interested in and what you think is helpful without reading that feedback, I think you can really get off track. 

00:43:30
[sil.] 

00:43:35
BILL O'HANLON She says, if I go there, I will be able to – and if I do have fun and get my mind off and I will be able to come back and resolve it a lot better than I would if we just kicked the horse. 

00:43:45
AMY Yeah, 'coz I will have a different perspective around it and it may not be that important to me. I mean, whatever I was fighting for, it may not be that important. 

00:43:50
BILL O'HANLON It wasn't that important or I was sorry or I see your point now, I didn't see it before. I got a little distanced from it, same thing with me, I have the same thing but I do worry, you know, like the person is going to – for me, what I would do is go read. That's one of the things I do to get my mind totally off but here we are in the middle of a fight and we are not resolved and my -- 

00:44:10
AMY You are reading. 

00:44:10
BILL O'HANLON My partner cannot read at that moment. She's like, I cannot read at that moment, how come you can? Sorry, I have got that kind of mind. I can compartmentalize things, I can go play golf, I could go run and yeah, I might be bothered for a little while but eventually it would go away and I would have fun. I am sorry, I am going to have fun. 

00:44:30
AMY Draw up that first green and I am out of there. 

00:44:30
(crosstalk) 

00:44:30
CHRISTINE Well, if you explain that you are going – and I have experienced this enough with Amy as I told you today that she does go off and I don't know what she does but she does resolve it and come back and -- 

00:44:45
BILL O'HANLON So I mentioned earlier about influencing people's feelings and their points of view while you are talking. I think that is an important point in this. You will see this in the next few segments that it is important in this approach to realize that people aren't any set or fixed way. That's part of this whole post-modern, constructivist, solution-based therapy, narrative therapy is that people are constantly revising their points of view and their feelings. They are not set in concrete. I have the sense that people come in with the problems and the feelings that they have and they are like a house or a structure they built of sugar cubes and the interview is like warm water that we pour over the sugar cubes to dissolve whatever problematic structures have been built up. Maybe we also help them build up new structures, perhaps we make like rock candy and it is a little more solid but this time it is a little more helpful, it's more of a preferred view of themselves and their lives, it's a more encouraging kind of sense. It's more possibility-oriented, more solution-oriented that they have solutions now. We are trying to get them to actually shift the way they feel, the way they think, the way they experience life and what they do in order to make things more solid but more workable. So it is a very deliberate process of influencing hopefully in a way that's collaborative and not impositional but also in the realization that there is no such thing as the set reality that you are going to discover. You are always going to be around influencing it in some way. So when I am talking with couples, I am not only helping them express and articulate what's going on, I am also helping them shape the articulation and the expression so that it is going to move them in the direction that they prefer. Now if I do that and move them in a direction that I prefer, that 's going to be too impositional, too much of my value and I am not going to tell them how they should live life after treatment is done. I am just going to help them get unstuck from the places where they seem to be stuck. 

00:46:45
[sil.] 

00:46:50
AMY But last time we had a fight about the kids and I wanted to do something and said, could Hilary go to her dad's 'coz we were going to do something and she said, no, she is part of the family and we got into this thing. Then it got to be a power struggle. Well, what happened was when I went away, it occurred to me, I thought, I don't have children, I don't know what that must feel like but I just in the privacy of my own head, I can go to these places but I wouldn't dare go to in front of her because it's too vulnerable and it's too much submitting. So in the privacy of my own head I can say well, my cat Maggie, you know, I brought Maggie into our situation and I thought – Maggie is a he so I will say him but it's not going to make sense but we didn't know when we named him but that's a different story. I thought what if Christine couldn't tolerate Maggie and I had to close him in a bathroom all day long? I had to keep him outside all the time or if he lived with us but it was a constant battle, Maggie is out of the bathroom, you need to get Maggie back in the bathroom and have him confined, and have him angry and pissed off all the time and – or confused and hurt and not know why he can't come out of the bathroom and sleep with me like he usually does and I thought that would be a constant struggle and I would be pissed off most of the time and I would be very torn about do I keep him cooped up like that and leave him, or if not -- you know what I mean, leave him confused or do I want to have Christine's comfort level high enough that we can actually interact and have fun together. 

00:48:20
BILL O'HANLON So here you know the stuff that when you are away from the situation, you would have never gotten there if you two are processing it? 

00:48:25
AMY Oh, I would have never gotten it when we were together. 

00:48:25
BILL O'HANLON It just wouldn't occur there because that other process is going on about power and who is right and who is wrong and defenses so -- 

00:48:35
CHRISTINE And that was very very helpful. 

00:48:35
BILL O'HANLON And that's what going off does certain times. 

00:48:40
AMY It gives me the freedom. It's sort of – I am bound by the fight when I am there but when I am out of it, then I have got a greater freedom to explore stuff in the security of not ... 

00:48:55
BILL O'HANLON And I am saying as long as you leave behind a message saying I am not taking off, I am not really leaving and abandoning. That is a great process. 

00:49:05
AMY I need to go and think about this. 

00:49:10
BILL O'HANLON So what you have just seen is a tape that combines individual and couple therapy with a same sex couple and you have seen an illustration of the six general strategies of couples therapy. You might have noticed that there was a fair amount of humor in the session. I like humor first of all, because people come in so grim I don't want therapy adding more to their grimness. Secondly, humor seems to loosen people up a little in terms of their points of view that they sometimes get stuck in, the righteousness of the whole thing and it creates a lighter thing in the whole session. Obviously you are not going to laugh at people, you are going to joke with them, sometimes poke fun at yourself, there was a lightness that seemed to come into the room from sometimes they were getting into very heavy kind of – sometimes righteous decisions and that happens sometimes in couple's treatment, you are going to have to deal with that, move them into a different kind of place and I think we have seen the movement in these video clips from misunderstandings to understanding from a sense of what can we do about this to, we have a lot of possibilities and solutions to this and that's what this tape is designed to illustrate some simple ways of working with couples in a very gentle and solution-oriented way to move them from one stuck sense individually, as a couple to a sense of possibility. 

00:50:35
[sil.]
