DEFNE KORAMAN Good afternoon, I'm Dr. Defne Koraman, I'm a faculty member in the council psychology program and have the honor of presenting Dr. Melanie M. Domenech Rodriguez. She's a professor psychology at Utah State University. At present, Dr. Domenech Rodriguez is actually engaged in programs of researching in Oregon, Missouri, Idaho. In Oregon, Dr. Domenech Rodriguez is collaborating with Iris educational media so develop an implement Padres Preparados, a preventative parenting intervention for Spanish speaking parents of pre-school aged children. Padres Preparados is a parent management training organ PMTO model intervention. In Missouri, Dr. Domenech Rodriguez is collaborating with colleagues on a projects to implement PMTO training in university settings using distance education technology with the ultimate goal of providing a sustainable model for the sevenesian of evidence based interventions. Finally Dr. Domenech Rodriguez is collaborating on a health resources and services administration grant pipeline to study, pipeline to the university targets linguistic in cultural competence of physician existence studies begins with the ultimate goal of improva, improving access to medical services for populations. Dr. Domenech Rodriguez is president elect after national Latino, Latino psychological association Dr. Domenech Rodriguez is a licensed psychologist and she obtained her doctoral degree at Colorado State University in 1999. Thank you for being here, and we're looking for hearing you.

MELANIE M. DOMENECH RODRIGUEZ Thank you very much. It's really an honor to be here. This is my first round table. And it's been humbling to know that I'm in this group with incredible, inspiring, talented, and accomplished people. So it's really an honor to be here. Thank you for the invitation. And I'm here today because I am, I'm really lucky. I'm lucky to be able to do something that I love and to be surrounded by people who are amazing sandbox mates and who invite me to play and who accept my invitations to play and so then we get to potentiate our work. And so what over the years has happened is that I have moved slowly from, from uh… the golden standard randomized control trial methodology that I was trained in, in graduate school into this world of using technology and media to advance the same principles of parenting and behavior change in the service of, of child outcomes, of positive child outcomes. So I am gonna share with you a little bit of the Foundation's a very little in terms of PMTO and Latino families, and then what I really wanna share is the work that I'm doing with Padres Preparados. And one of that really, really exciting things about PMTO is that there's this metaphor of elephants all the way down and so they are parallel processes at every level. And I'm now at a stage in my career where I've been able to, at the same time work on the training of therapists, of parents, of therapist, and of therapist trainers. And so it's been a really fun process. So Parent Management Training-Oregon model is basically Jerry Patterson's model of parents training and what is does and these are my roots and psychology is it specifies the theory of change. It specifies mechanisms for behavior change. It provides a strong evidence base both within the US and more across multicultural samples and actually internationally and across many countries. And then it specifies the structure for dissemination and implementation and all of those pieces make my wok possible. The theory is actually fairly simple if you look at that it's a free picture. And basically what it's saying is that child behavior change, changes directly from their contact with parents. And that parents parenting behaviors is affected by their social context. And this is wonderful for a multicultural psychologist, right? Because my first question whenever I enter a room is "Where is culture?" And are we gonna talk about that because if we're not, I'm not interested. And so it was right there in the, in the theory of change, the context affects the parents. And the parents have the power to affect positive behavior change in their children. In terms of the mechanisms of change, what we have are some core components, positive involvement, skills building, problem solving, monitoring, supervision, and effective discipline. If you do any work and parenting, these look really familiar, right? Um, and then the supporting components are, are good directions and I'm show you a little bit. Emotional regulation and effective communication and what's really need about the system we use them at every stage and so hopefully will be able to see a little of that in the videos that we created for the families and Padres Preparados. This is the evidence base, I'm not gonna bore you with this so if I say to say there are a lot of samples all over the place and basically we find that the mediational model stands across the board. You can have families in Norway. You can have families in Iceland, in Denmark, in Mexico, in the United States, across States, and we find that the mediational model holds. And so and the impact on outcomes are many. And some of them are really surprising, like, nine years after a PTC trial, there were changes still evident in arrest rates and income for parents that participated in the treatment versus the control groups. And so the outcomes are quite vary parental depression. So we're targeting child non-compliance. But at the end of the day, we see benefits across very many dimensions which is very, very exciting. So in terms of implementation and dissemination, there's both a structure and a process which we've been following in the Padres Preparados. The structure specifies how do you train, how do you coach, and how do you observe these processes everything is evidence based but the processes are collaborative even they're flexible and so for those of you that know my work, you know, that I spent a fair amount of time talking about cultural adaptations of evidence-based interventions. So when I met the program developer on the first year of my postdoc back in 1990, 9, 899. Umm… you know, she handed me a manual and I said, "Well, how seven stone is this thing" And she said, "Oh, we keep it in a three-ring binder. Because we figure, we need to take the sheet out and replace them occasionally. And I said "Okay." We, this is gonna be great. This is gonna be great fun. And in fact, it has been great fun. In terms of cultural adaptation, I do wanna make a distinction because of the work that I do. I work on culturally adapting evidence-based interventions and in particular this parenting intervention. But there is a difference in my world between cultural adaptation and cultural competence. And I'm, I spend a whole lot of other, other of my time working on developing cultural competence in individual practitioners most notably in psychologists and training but more recently actually with physician assistant's students which has been a really exciting evolution of my work. Cultural adaptation is what I do when I'm working with manuals. So when I look at a manual which is a guide for a treatment provider, we make adjustments to metaphors to symbols. We may add some content depending if we're, you know, if we were working with African-American families for example, we need to talk about racial socialization. This is a culturally specific parenting practice. And I'm not gonna run a parenting program for African-American families without talking about racial socialization that would be silly. So the cultural adaptation is really to the manual looking at what are the materials that are there are they adequate are they gonna be acceptable, how do you move, move that sort of part of fact right which is written. Cultural competence targets the therapists, how are you gonna interact with families, how are you gonna understand people's values and believes and convey respect, how are you gonna develop that collaborative relationship with your patients or your clients. So that you can move toward this common go. And really the reason to culturally adapt is to increase engagement, increase retention, increase outcomes, and of course, there are a wealth of ethical considerations. At the end of the day, I don't think I have a right to think you, to provide anybody with treatment. I don't think people are lucky that I walked into a room. And I have 20 years of training and so therefore they ought to just do whatever I say. I think, it's an honor to walk into somebody's living room and be asked "How can I make this better? Do you have any ideas?" I think, that is, that is a profound honor to have somebody walk and welcome you into their space. And in essence, reach out and ask for help and support in one of the most vulnerable and intimate contexts that you can think of which is the family. There are tons of models of cultural adaptation. It's been wonderful if you're interested. I'm happy to talk to you at length about this today is probably not the day. I was really fortunate to work with a colleague Guillermo Bernal on an edited volume on cultural adaptations. There's tons of models in there. We have some other chapter authors right in the room which is really fantastic. So there are models we followed them. And we follow them in the service of providing the best possible service for, for families, for culturally diverse families. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. I'm a native Spanish speaker. I have a particular service that I can perform in a contest with Latino families that I'm very fortunate to be able to provide. And so I have spent most of my time there. There are many, many challenges, among them academic achievement. I'm sure, you've grown tired of hearing about this. There's the immigration context, all of the trauma involved in that process. There are health disparities which all you have to do is open any app that gives you news. And you will find your health disparities report of the day. There are economic conditions and mobility. And we have a literature honestly that doesn't really reflect the wealth of difficulties that are families face and some of the potential ways in which we can address this. So even as researchers, we have a great deal of work to do to even better understand the challenging context. But there's also a lot of opportunities Latino Families are young. There's a lot of kids go to school. This is the future right there's all of this promise right there we have a wonderful opportunity for prevention activities which as where I live most of the time. We have kid's skills, Latino kids start ahead of the game in terms of social skills. You know that research, it's incredible. I, as a parents, I forget that every now, and then I have to remind myself 'cause teenagers don't readily show that but it's there. There's an incredible wealth of skills in terms of bilingualism and biculturalism. Again as a parent, I forget, you know, and sometimes I turn around and I see my kids navigating different contexts. And I think, "Oh, there it is. I forgot that was there." I sort of took it for granted. How are we capitalizing on those opportunities to, to help build on strengths. So the program that we've been working on Padres Preparados is, is an evolution of PMTO. We basically got support from the National Institutes of Health to develop a culturally adapted evidence-based parenting program for Latino families. And the best thing of this was that I got to work with head start. And so my favorite practicum as a graduate student 20 years ago was at a head start site. It was the first time that a supervisor said "Home bases are okay. You can actually be a clinical psychologist and not have to be in a traditional therapy room following the 50-minute hour." And its sort out blew my mind, right? It was one of those moments when you think oh, all the structures perpetuate potentially some other vary structures like create difficulties and access for, for, for our patients and for our families and so being able to work with head start has been a really essential and exciting part of this project. So our target was just to empower Latino families and so NIH was really excited and they gave us a little bit of money we got a phase-1 grant. And it was Padres Preparados, the literacy focus addition we developed one session it was a very short video and I was basically demonstrating in a brief video how parents could stimulate literacy if you worked Latino families at all, you probably have heard "I can't teach my children. I don't know how to read, how am I gonna teach my child to read. Or I only speak Spanish, how am I supposed to help support my child's development academic development in a US based context when I don't speak English. And the answer is there are many reason which you could do that. It actually turns out that if you stimulate reading and Spanish, you're stimulating reading period and actually it's a good thing for your child to be bilingual. So we love that you're gonna grow the home language. These are all wonderful things and so we develop the little video and we got 44 mothers and two fathers in head start to agree to participate in this, in this little pilot study. And basically most of our families had less than a high school education. We have a lot of stay-at home. Moms, most parents were not working. And if you look at this, the families were very, they were very traditional according to the alteration model. So… spoke predominantly Spanish and identified most prominently with Latino culture and certainly had a low level of identification with white American culture. So with these families, we went out and ran some focus groups at these incredible Head Start centers that were truly community centers which is very wonderful places to be. And we just gave families copies of these DVDs. And I wanna show you if it's possible to click on that link. I wanna show you just the first minute because I want you to see that this was a pilot. But I want you to listen to the, to the accent. I want you to look at the images. And then I want you to connect with the Preparados pilot. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Once upon a time (not so long ago) there were two families, two families who were on the verge of a change that was simple and at the same time-extraordinary. The Gutierrez family… 

00:15:50
[music] 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN It's time, sweetheart. 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN So soon? 

00:16:00
[music] 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN And the Santiago family… 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Azucena! Let's go! 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN They began the day as always- 

00:16:15
[non-English narration] 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Getting ready for work and school. 

00:16:25
[music] 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Let's see, have learned your letters yet? Read me something. Come on, they haven't taught you to read yet? What does this say? 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Mommy, where's his sword? 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN I think it fell… What do they do in Head Start all day if they don't teach them to read? 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Give it time, darling. You don't learn these things in a day. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Yes, but time passes and then one day… if you still haven't learned to read, they send you to work like an ox. That's how it is for kids who don't learn to read. 

00:17:15
MELANIE M. DOMENECH RODRIGUEZ Okay, let's go ahead and pause it. Thank you. So if you can see, these are stories that are built around the very issues that families are struggling with on a daily basis, right? And when you talk about an intervention that has five core components, one of which is positive involvement. You can start really quickly seeing how in this exchange. There isn't a lot of positive involvement happening. It starts positive. I want to read with you. Here's the newspaper. Let's see, show me some letters so that is excited, and then the kid goes "Where's my sword, I think, I'm gonna deflect and I'm gonna duck and cover. And I'm out of here. I don't want to do this." So what do you do now? And for a lot of us and I count myself because I have been absolutely unable to get my children to a level of bilingualism that I'm okay with, you know, then you get critical. This is a pretty common thing. And so in these very short videos, we show alternative ways. It's like here is how it is. We realize this is really frustrating and here's an alternative. If you noticed, when you saw that video, the voice-over is not that of a true native speaker. And I remember being in that position where we had gotten this grand. This video is out. We're handing it to families. And I am internally cringing. I'm thinking, "What would I do, if somebody handed me this," right? And as an academic I would have said, "Boo, you don't know what you're doing. How dare you." And I would have been critical 'cause we've been really trained well to do that. And I probably would have thrown the DVD in a corner. Those were not the families that we were working with, right? And we were doing a lot of community level work. I was at all the focus groups. I flew out so much to Oregon. I started feeling like a second home. And I just put my best face on and really, really hope that the families would get the best of what we were offering. And we did a lot of assessments. And it was incredible when these data came back. We found really high levels of consumer satisfaction. We had reduced levels of parental stress at time to which was about a month later, we had significantly higher intentions to engage in literacy activities with kids. We had parents who were taking a little knowledge test and actually showed greater knowledge of how to engage their children in literacy activities which ultimately was really that keep finding for me. And so, you know, the other thing that was really interesting is the, the team sent this out. I would have never done this which is why everybody should work in teams because those places in which you are anxious or afraid, or the places where other people won't be, and you will probably be thankful many times over. So they sent this out and it turned out that people who create education videos thought. This was pretty damn good. And you know, I'm sitting there with all of my judgments thinking. We could make this so much better. Just you wait. So we did. We went to phase-2. And we got a follow up grant. We expanded the content to eight sessions which was really fantastic so we polished session-1. And this was one of probably the more difficult things I had to do was to tell my colleague who I really cared about, who did the voice over. Your voice is fantastic. We need a native speaker on this. And then we did the RCT and we did teacher training with an eye on sustainability. So the fact that I have completed the multiple levels of training to do the mentoring on PMTO has been really handy on this project. So we, you know, we were gonna do this RCT, and then all of the stuff that I never was trained to do had to be done. And so again, teams are wonderful, right? Without Iris educational media none of this would have happened. We had to write scripts. We had to film. I realized midway through that I had to film segments and so talk about things you haven't been trained to do. I was told many times over to start talking like an academic and was in essence shaped using all the positive PMTO skills on how to do that I'm very grateful for that. We had to develop a manual that I knew how to do really well. We had to develop text because we're using midweek tests to communicate with parents. Latino parents love texting. And there's all sorts of really interesting reasons for that. It's a really cheap way to communicate everybody has access to it. You may have limited minutes. But most people don't have unlimited text to have unlimited texting. So we learned in the process of the focus groups that the midweek contact shouldn't be fun, it should be text. So we had to develop then the text scripts and do the teacher training. And then I provide a teacher coaching both written and Skype or FaceTime because I decided I didn't want to move to Oregon, like, so, in order to keep my life in, in Logan, I had to do that online. So really using technology at so many levels, so we developed the manual. These are the sessions reading, teaching positive behavior, giving clear directions, teaching routines, managing emotions, appropriate consequences, problem-solving, and then our celebration session which is something that is really key. Anytime we do any sort of community work. So we come together, there's typically food, there's diplomas, there's celebration, there's kids watching their parents receive diplomas which is incredible if you haven't done that. Please go and do it. Just run a group, just so you can get to the last session and see kids faces when their parents get a diploma. It is good for your soul. Our manual is structured so we were following the PMTO model. You have an introduction. We had a parenting map which is a bit different from the traditional PMTO model where we're talked about values and goals. What is it that you value for your children? What are the steps you take to get to that? What are some of the obstacles? And then really a lot of focus on practice, so here are some skills, how are we gonna practice that? I got these data about a week ago while I was in the Dominican Republic. And there was this just kind of surreal moment of being in the Dominican Republic as part of a short-term medical service trip, doing direct work in the field with, with families, and then looking at these data, it was like my worlds were sort of colliding. So far we have 68 parents that have participated in this RCT, most of the parents are married. Again we have many parents with less than a high school education. Our sample was mostly high school or less. Sorry, I'm not, not doing so good on that… directionality. We had one parent that one Latino mother who was partnered with a white American man who was very excited to participate, so welcome to board. Other than him, everybody else was Latino. Most parents were born outside of the US. And children and parents mostly spoke Spanish. Although if you look at this, it looks a lot like what you would expect, if you work with Latino families, parents speak mostly Spanish. You start seeing the transitions and the kids toward maybe same or more English. These kids are three to five years of age. So these numbers are probably gonna shift over time. So we recruited, we randomized, we did our measurements, we did our classes, and we did our assessments, and here's the really sexy stuff. So I'm just gonna give it to you. We have seen with 68 parents. And now keep in mind that half of these parents are in the control group. Significant changes in child behavior both pro-social behavior has increased significantly and the treatment group compared to the control as well as reductions in hyperactive behavior which we have observed in the treatment group compared to the control. And one of the things that I do, by the way because ethics is one of my areas, it's this whole thing with cheating and lying with statistics. These are the actual ranges so the scale range is 1-3. So when you look at each of these figures, you're looking at the actual range and measurements. So some of these don't look as spectacular as they could if I had restricted the range but I don't like doing that. So okay, here we go. Parenting self-efficacy has increased. What's really cool about this is that we see statistical significance. So we see an increase in self-efficacy. But look at it there's room to grow. So our work is not yet done. In terms of efficacy and program specific variables, we also see an increase and if you look at that partial Eta square, it's a pretty nice. Effect all of these effects are both clinically and statistically significant. We see increases in parenting practices. This is the Alabama parenting questionnaire. But even more exciting is that the parenting practices themselves that are tied to the intervention have also shown a dramatic increase. And I just want you to look at that partial Eta square for a minute and just savor it. I don't get to see data like this very often. So this, this was the point where the coalition and the explosion happened. I was really, really excited. We see that same fairly significant effect with parental knowledge improved in the treatment group. And we don't haven't seen yet any sort of differences in parenting stress. The trend is in the right direction but as you can see the parenting stress levels are pretty low. That's actually great news because we were targeting a prevention sample. So we're trying to prevent problem behaviors from occurring. And what we have our parents that still have a lot of their batteries sort of charged up and are improving in their knowledge and their specific skills and improving in their efficacy. So lots of really, really good things going on. What has been unique about the study is that we, I have been able to fair to spend… a fair amount of time training the teachers. And so when I talk to our educational media about this joint venture, they were experts on how to put programs together. So they wanted to do the videos, they wanted to do all of the production stuff get that ready, assessments online, this is great texting. It's fabulous. They're not used to training people. And so and I said "We can't know, we have to train people because these people are having contact with these families and so there is contact happening with do no harm, we can't just go into communities." And so they said, "Okay, well, how half a day." Nobody no laughter really half a day, okay. So I laughed, but we, so we negotiated we got it to a date. And I did a day-long training that was an introduction to the manual but that really focused on the role place. And what was amazing about that process is that, that is where we host the teachers. So the teachers were excited. But if he worked with head start, you know, they go to these trainings multiple times a year, right? So they're, like, "Oh, here's another training. It's exciting." There is hope in the horizon. But we've known that a lot of these don't work so we're just gonna temper our excitement perhaps! So they got even more hooked 'cause they were doing the role plays. And they didn't do them quite right the first time but then we did them again, and then they felt, like, maybe they knew what they were doing. So it was a really engaging process for them. We didn't focus a lot on the maps and the values which was really interesting because it later became an area of struggle. So as I was coaching, and you can see the first cohort, we had two sites and eight classes. And I actually provided eight written coaching to the teachers and seven Skype, direct Skype or FaceTime direct contact coaching which is a fair amount of coaching for the teachers. They were getting those role plays down. So I was watching their videos in advance. They had those role plays down. They were doing great things. And I was able to just kind of soften the edges of, you know, starting to use Scooby loops using reinforcers to demonstrate for the parents how to use them at home with their kids and really fairly advanced stuff compared to what was happening with, with the maps and the values. And teachers are super, super excited. We have teachers signing up wanting to do this program above and beyond the slots that we have for them to do them. So not only are the teachers that we have engaged to teach the classes really excited about them but they've gotten their peers excited about it. And now we've got people contacting us saying, "Can we be the next people to teach. We really wanna teach this class." And so we had a teacher just wrote from the moment they receive training, the teachers loved it. They have gotten many teaching curricula a head start but nothing like this one. This is a step-by-step guide and good for teachers. It helps them personally and while teaching parents. And so they love the fact that they can teach and evolve while teaching the lesson plan. So it's been a really, really fun piece and actually our next grant might actually focus on this. So we've been working at these different levels. And so we've been working with the parents, and then we've been working with the teachers, and one of my collaborations with a former student who is now one of my best teachers. It's actually working with preparing therapists. And what we're doing is we are using a blended learning model. This is pretty funny actually. There are five campuses Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Utah State, and Washington University. I think, that is if I'm not incorrect, there's three time zones there. So it's been hilarious to try to even schedule these things much less pull them off. So you'll have one person at one side eating lunch and the other one for like would having midday coffee. What are you doing? And basically what we're doing is we're using Google Hangout, Google Docs a HIPAA-compliant portal, and the PMTO manuals. And we are having meetings once a week for an hour and a half where students actually have to engage PMTO skills. They have to show them in class across these five sites. We're on Google Hangouts which is actually a much more powerful platform than I grab a credit for. I was sure that this was not gonna happen but it, it has not failed us actually today. And you know, the teeth, this is my colleague. We prepare while our children are climbing over us. And we're on Skype trying to manage our multiple roles. Anna was a former student of mine who is now at Washington University and working on her way to becoming a PMTO mentor. So far we've been able to keep really good fidelity to the model which is really surprising because this is a model that requires a lot of hands-on. So try to imagine yourself as a professor with three students in your room a Google Hangout camera with Ford little tiny screens with two to three students at each site and you have to do a role play that involves students across at least two often three or four sites. How do you do that? We had to figure it out. And actually it's a great deal of fun. And here you can see the students. We were making we, we had a nod to Virginia Satir and we did elephant sculptures. And so these are the students trying to do their, their different sculptures. But we've managed to keep pretty good fidelity to the PMTO model. These are the five, fidelity of implementation categories in terms of knowledge, I think we've managed to keep pretty accurate content. That's the easiest one, right? Right now I'm talking if I just stand in front of a room and talk-talk-talk, I can give you all the knowledge. It will be perfect. I'll get great fidelity. The PMTO model has that as one of five components that tends to be the more common way to measure fidelity. But we actually measure fidelity as competent adherence, not just as a knowledge base. And so you have to follow a specific structure which means you have to have an agenda. And you have to keep to it. If you don't keep to it, you get very bad fidelities score. Your teaching has to be active. If I stand and do exactly what I'm doing right now in a parent training session, I will get very bad fidelities scores. So it's, I'm only standing back here because I'm also very compliant and I was told that I needed to stay behind the podium otherwise I'd be jumping around. It's what I've been trained to do at this point is under my skin. So we've managed to do these active teaching and role play across sites because you need to build the team across the, the sites not just within. The processes we've had to stay pretty sensitive to students needs. Right now one of our cohorts, we were not able to schedule them in the spring. They're watching every single video of the class. They're turning in their homework. And they're meeting with us independently for their group supervision. So we've had to be super flexible and how to make this happen while still maintaining our expectations for participation and productivity which has really been an interesting process. And then, I think, there I say, I think, we've had a fair amount of fun while doing it which is not a small thing. Again if you're following the PMTO model, if you want a good fidelity score, you got to show that your, your clients, and your families are engaged and that they're learning. If you cannot demonstrate that, you do not get good fidelity scores. So it's actually one of the dimensions. in terms of what we found so far we have great attendance. We have pretty good evidence of skills acquisitions. We have that through these narrative evaluations that we did that we have not finished scoring yet so we read them all, got really excited, and then started scoring. And we're still in the middle of that. We have institutional support. My institution, for example give students independent study credits for, for these activities. They're actually considering making it a course that is in the curriculum. The students have actually reported great acceptability through an independent evaluator that we asked to help us on this team challenges, certainly scheduling, technological smoothness, for example the coaching. Our students that have had, we had last week, we, we had class and there was a video camera, there was a video in the video camera and there was no way to retrieve the video from the video camera. So this is it we're in class the four sites are there. We have a video camera and the student that needed to show the video basically said, "Okay, let's try this." She hit play and stuck the video camera in front of, of the laptop camera. And that's what we did and it was fine we heard it. We thought it was all good. We just moved on so we have to do a lot of this kind of problem solving on the run would it be nicer to have a clearer image absolutely. Can we get there? I absolutely believe so we need to get there but right now we know that this is a challenge. And then, I think, the biggest challenge and this is one that is very befitting to this conference is how are we gonna be able to do this certification in an academic setting. I think, we've had a very big disconnect. We talked about academia being this ivory tower. And it's interesting because we have there's the community ivory tower disconnect. But then there's also this disconnect with folks who are doing incredible clinical work in evidence based arenas but not in academic settings. And they have a structure that is very different from the academic environment. And I think, often times an academia, we say, "Come to us, adjust to our model, talk about culture. We can unpack that for a little while if we wanted to." But we don't ever say how can we fit to your culture and context. You have been doing something that works maybe we need to move towards where you're at to figure out. How we can make this work for us? And that's what Anna and I have been doing in essence is saying, we are in these structures and we are going to push every wall and every nook and cranny into a flexible mold as much as we possibly can. And we're still trying to figure this piece out. Okay, so needless to say, if you haven't gotten this notion by now, I am one in a very large community of scholars, they're advancing this work. I've been fortunate to be the person to be invited here to tell you about this work. But none of this is mine. It belongs to, it belongs to a very broad community that it's actually national and international at USU. My research assistant JC and Rosario Colon has been instrumental in structuring me to make sure that I can do all the things that I said I'm gonna do at Iris educational media. We have grant writers, movie producers, research assistants, singers, statisticians, graphic designers, this incredible group of people that have created these absolutely beautiful materials. The Head Start centers have been fundamental to our success. And at Washington University, Ana Bauman and her team have been fundamental to the success of the blended learning model as well. And so basically what I have shown you is a program of research that belongs to, to a collective. And that at all levels integrates technology and meaningful ways that I believe are really working with us to break down some of the barriers that have been in the way for folks to access much-needed services. And so I feel very fortunate to have access to this technology to bring down some of these walls and to advance social justice. So thank you for letting me share that with you today. I wanted to be sure that there would be time for questions. I figured this is the time of the day when you've been to a bunch of presentations everybody's running a little late. And so unbelievably, I have met my goal. This is probably a first that I actually ended at the exact minute I intended to. So we actually have about 10 minutes, I think, do you have any questions? Yeah. 

00:39:25
Why did you choose the name "Padres Preparados" and leave mothers out? 

00:39:25
MELANIE M. DOMENECH RODRIGUEZ So and, and I think, including fathers in interventions and family interventions in particular has been a real focus. And we have ruined (inaudible ) and Michigan State has really trailblaze in this arena with the PMTO and has probably sexier data than I do. I think, he has 96% retention of Latino fathers in the, in the RCT, no, it was, yeah, we do little dances we like have these calls and then I have very funny screen captures all over my computer 'cause it's just people kind of celebrating these data. But we were not targeting just fathers. Father this is, is actually in Spanish a word that includes both mothers and fathers. And we did have this conversation, right? Do we want to say Padres Preparados and I said, "No," I really don't. I want fathers also to participate because I know about Padres Preparados work. And I know how powerful that is, and then the, is that called alliteration, the peepee that sounds? Yeah, okay, so we like the sound of it Padres Preparados. And it's turned out to be a really cool that's sort of ready, being at the ready has turned out to be a really kind of interesting metaphor. So it's been very well received by my families. 

00:40:45
Why is the number of participants who are fathers so low? 

00:40:45
MELANIE M. DOMENECH RODRIGUEZ Thank you for that question, very much. So why are the number of fathers so, so low. Actually we've had great participation from fathers in the intervention. We're only collecting data from one parent because of limited resources. So we're paying parent, like, in like a many our RCTs you pay for the assessments but you don't pay for the intervention. And so we basically said "Come one, come all, this is great." But we only have money to pay for assessments. And what's interesting is parents actually many times work together to complete these assessments. But for some reason they check. When they're checking who is answering, they check mother. And so we, I probably need to get those numbers up there for fathers. And we have them, we've had really, really nice attendance. And the last class of cohort 1, last December, I think, I went up to Oregon. And I had a father that was there. This is incredible so a father came and said "Thank you so much for all of your hard work." They know me because I appear in every single one of the videos. So I go there and do they're super excited to see me. And I have not met them. But I'm familiar because I've been in all these videos and a dad came to me and said "Thank you so much this has been so wonderful. I'm sorry my wife couldn't be here. My son got appendicitis and she's at the hospital with him." And I said "And you're here." And he said "Yes, this was very important. We needed to finish this out. We've gotten so much from this class that I took the responsibility for bringing the knowledge from tonight back. And my wife is taking care of our son." And I, you can't make stories like that up, I mean, it just was incredible so, so yeah. We've had great, dad participation, it's just not very well reflected up there. 

00:42:35
Are you only using DVDs? 

00:42:35
MELANIE M. DOMENECH RODRIGUEZ So again thank you for the question 'cause you're helping me fill in gaps. So the question is are you just using the DVDs. Actually we're not. We have a website padrespunto.com and parents can go there and not only can they get the videos online but they can also get all of the course materials online. So all of the home practice assignment handouts or any handouts that we give our online, they also get the text. And so the, the midweek text is a reminder that the group is coming and a link there's two of them and a link for the web-based video. And we're getting, we're getting some feedback that parents are going online to watch them. So we're, we're targeting from multiple angles to see what parents like the best. Honestly the thing people are raving about the most is texting. It really caught me off guard. I was not expecting that but people love the text. And you can embed a link in there, and you can send them to YouTube, and bloom, you have a video. So super interesting stuff yeah. 

00:43:40
Have you had any issues with using texts to send information to participants? 

00:43:45
MELANIE M. DOMENECH RODRIGUEZ We have not had any issues. The only issue and if you work with Latino families, you will, you will recognize this also the only issue that we have as people change their phone numbers. And so they get these, like, temporary phones, and then right, and then you replace it. And that is when they come back and say "Update my phone to blah, blah." And we've already sent a bunch of text and they bounce back and whatnot. That is actually the more than the connectivity issue that's the challenge that we have with the technology. Again unexpected but that's the beauty of research is to learn these things. Any other questions? I am super excited about this work, I think it's innovative. I think that, you know, whatever many years 15, 16 years after being an academic. I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to sort of renew, refresh, and do things where I was constantly learning. I'm super, super excited. If you have any interest in this work or want to know more about it, just email me. I'm really happy to talk about it. So feel free to contact me after you've returned home from the roundtable and some of the stuff things in. So and thank you again, thank you Marie, for the invitation. I'm really honored to be here and glad to share this work. Thanks.
