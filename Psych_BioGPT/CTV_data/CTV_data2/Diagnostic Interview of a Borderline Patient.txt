Diagnostic Interview of 

00:00:55
a Borderline Patient 

00:00:55
Otto F. Kernberg, 

00:00:55
MD, FAPA 

00:00:55
OTTO KERNBERG I have to disappoint you, I’m not going to have a patient sitting next to me, but will show you a video of an initial interview that shows the technique of structural interviewing that we have developed, because of time, I will not be able to show the entire interview, I’ll have to interrupt and forward. So you will not get the full experience, but I trust that you will see enough of it to see the illustration of the general technical approach. Let me explain the technique of this interview very briefly and you may observe it throughout the interview. I start out always asking for a question, what brings you here? What’s the nature of your difficulties? What do you expect from treatment? Where are you now? This is like a broad opening to permit the patient to go into any direction. But then I focus -- any problem? 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Can you repeat the four questions? 

00:02:10
OTTO KERNBERG The four questions are, what brought you here? What is the nature of your difficulties? What do you expect from treatment? Where are you now? Then I -- and I tell the patient whatever I know about him. Then I focus on the patient’s present symptoms. I go in great detail in all his symptoms, physical, emotional, social, and only after I have a sense or have a complete view of all his symptoms, I go to the next subject, which is his present personality. I ask the patients how they function in three major areas of life that cover their present life, sex and love, work and profession, social life and creativity. Of course, if the symptoms already refer to difficulties in the patient’s social life, then the enquiry of symptoms and that of the present personality go hand-in-hand and there is a natural flow from one orientation to the next. But in any case, it goes from symptoms to present personality. I focus sharply on present personality until I know as much as I feel I need to know what’s going on in the patient’s present life. Then, I evaluate identity by which I mean, the degree to which the patient’s self-concept and his concepts of significant others is integrated clear, coherent or to what extent the concept of self and others is diffuse, contradictory, dissociated, chaotic. This is very important because an integrated concept of self and of significant others, what I call, normal identity shows higher level of personality disorders, while lack of an integrated self and lack of integrated concept of significant others shows severe personality disorders or borderline personality organization, not borderline personality disorder, but severe organization. First, I ask the patient to describe two or three important people -- the most important people in his present life, or only one, if there’s only one. And only then, I ask him to describe himself as a person. Once I have clarified this issue, I go on to the last item, which is testing of reality testing, to what extent does the patient maintain empathy with ordinary criteria of social reality, or to what extent are they lost. In other words, does the patient have a psychosis, does the patient have an illness that’s more severe than a personality disorder. I test reality testing by pointing out to the patient what seems to me strangest, most incomprehensible in his attitude, his behavior, his thinking, or his affect as they show in the sessions with me. Then, I select what is most inappropriate in affect, thought or behavior and share with the patient tactfully that something seems to me strange, in his affect or thought or behavior. Can he see that. If the patient is able to empathize with my view, I think that he is solid in reality. If the patient gets confused by that, or seems to be functioning worse, that maybe an indication of a psychotic illness. And if I see that, I would go on with a standard psychiatric examination of patients who have either an organic mental disorder or a psychotic disorder. That is the basic outline that usually takes between a minimum of 45 minutes and to a maximum of an hour-an-a-half. This interview lasts for about an hour-an-a-half. We don’t have the time here, so that I’ll have to jump and there is a risk of missing some significant segments. But I do hope that at least you’ll get an important part of all of this. It’s a difficult task with such a huge audience in such a limited period of time. I have done this with audiences such as this, but with two hours and that creates a very different experience. So bear with me. In the potential frustration, I’ll do all I can to signal the most important issues. I want to tell you something else. This patient is not a real patient, but an actor. However, it is an actor, who is not one of the ordinary actors, who function for the psychopharmacological industry or whom you see on TV, this is one of the top actors in the Netherlands who speaks English, and who has studied in great detail the history, the record of a certain patient to the extent that he has identified with that patient completely. I refused to do this interview because I didn’t want to participate in theater. The person in-charge of that convinced me at least to give it a try. I started the interview with lots of internal suspiciousness and resentment of being shown in theater. But, after ten minutes I was so captivated, I forgot -- I thought it was a real patient. And because of that conviction that was unchanged, I believe that I’m showing you not theater, but a real situation. So you have to take this from me as a personal confession or statement, but you will have a chance to judge it for yourself. I hope this goes well. 

00:09:35
OTTO KERNBERG  I’m doctor Kernberg as you have heard and I’ve been asked to see you with double intention to find out about your difficulties in order to discuss with the team here, how best to help in your treatment, and at the same time for educational purposes in order to participate in the teaching activities of this institution. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:10:20
OTTO KERNBERG The only thing I know about you is your name. Mr. Copes(ph) and that you’re 40 or 41 years old. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN 40 years old. 

00:10:30
OTTO KERNBERG  Well, let me tell you the questions that I have. First of all I would like to know what brought you here to treatment. Then, what’s the nature of your difficulties, symptoms, problems, everything that you consider an issue for treatment, where you need help with. Then what you expect from treatment really, and finally in short, where you are now? 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN A lot of questions. 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Why I am here. That’s something I wonder myself because -- to start with, for me it’s very difficult to come here because the last time I had something to do with therapists before and my last experience with two therapists were not very beautiful experiences. It was about five months ago, I went for help together with my girlfriend, with whom I was living, and within the sessions, five months ago, we went there together, my girlfriend and me, but there were some -- something happened in the sessions and they were very friendly in my face and behind my back, they talk to my girlfriend out of the relationship, so at the moment it is very hard for me to trust anyone. That’s the difficulty for me, because I have the feeling that people cheated me again. So I had a relationship for four years with my girlfriend, and in my opinion it was -- we had our problems, but it was a good relationship. In my opinion, it was a beautiful relationship, but afterwards my girlfriend told me, she felt not happy within the relationship. Probably I haven’t seen a lot of things in the relationship. So for one day we were in a relationship and the next day I found a note in which she wrote she had to leave me without a lot of explanations. That’s one of the reasons that I’m wondering now what to do with my life; I had some relationships before that went wrong and it seems that I don’t know how to be in a relationship but at the same time I don’t know how to live alone. It’s very hard for me to be alone. And so I wonder -- I've been living with my sister for two months because I couldn’t stand to be alone. Now, I’m living alone again and my sister convinced me of going here and to ask for treatment, to give myself another chance. So and that’s the reason why I’m here, to give myself another chance. 

00:14:55
[sil.] 

00:15:10
OTTO KERNBERG And other than what you’ve told me, do you have any other problems or difficulties? 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN  Yes, one of my problems is that I never seem to notice what I’m doing with people. Sometimes people react on me and I don’t understand their reactions. I don’t understand why sometimes people feel threatened by me, because it’s never my intention to threaten people. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN And I’ll at this time, I think after all these failures in my relationships, I think what’s the purpose of it all, what’s the meaning of my life. I don’t’ see any meaning at the moment. I -- sometimes it’s hard for me to give myself a good reason to stay alive. 

00:16:30
[sil.] 

00:16:45
OTTO KERNBERG What you’ve described to me is things that other people have told you. If I understand you correctly -- 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:16:55
OTTO KERNBERG Your girlfriend left you, it's a surprise to you and your sister suggested that you come here, and other people feel threatened by you? 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:17:10
OTTO KERNBERG  Do you see anything as a problem in you. I do understand that you’ve come here because you’re listening to the people who told you that you should come here. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, yes. 

00:17:25
OTTO KERNBERG I understand that. But in addition, have these people made you think about yourself and is there anything that you see as a problem in yourself other than what others tell you or how are you reacting to what others tell you in terms of observing your own interactions with them? 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN I must – there is something I -- what am I doing alone, that’s what I’m wondering all the time, because apparently I’m doing a lot of things, nothing the right way. But-- 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN I mean -- when so many people tell me that I should get help, then, yeah. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:30
OTTO KERNBERG So you’re saying you’re following their suggestions without really knowing what if anything is wrong with you, is that what you’re saying? 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN Yes, Yes. 

00:18:40
OTTO KERNBERG Do you experience anything as a problem, as a difficulty, emotionally, physically, mentally. I mean, if other people were not telling you that you have problems, would there be anything that you would experience as a reason to come to see a psychiatrist or not really? 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN Yes, sometimes it scares me, what I’m doing to people without bad intentions. People feel -- sometimes they feel -- 

00:19:30
[sil.] 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN For myself, what I see as my problem, how do I find a meaning for my existence because I – now I’m living alone for a few months, and it’s very hard for me to give myself a meaning because this is the third relationship that went wrong, and before I had two relationships and they went wrong in almost the same way, that is that my girlfriends left me without explaining a lot of things. And for me, it was -- I’m still wondering why did -- where did it wrong? Why did it go wrong? For me, it was a surprise, and I -- sometimes people seem to see things about me, I don’t see that myself. 

00:21:05
[sil.] 

00:21:05
OTTO KERNBERG And that girlfriend that left you, what’s her name? 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN Saskia(ph). 

00:21:10
OTTO KERNBERG Saskia? 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN Yes, Saskia. 

00:21:15
OTTO KERNBERG How long had you been -- you had been living -- how long had you been living --? 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN For four years. 

00:21:20
OTTO KERNBERG Four years? 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN Four years we have been living together. 

00:21:20
OTTO KERNBERG  How old is she? How old is she? 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN She is 35. 

00:21:25
OTTO KERNBERG  35. 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:21:30
OTTO KERNBERG And, what -- can you tell me something about your relationship with her. Was it a satisfactory relationship as far as you were concerned? 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN : For me, it was, but for her, it wasn’t. 

00:21:45
OTTO KERNBERG And, were you in love with her? 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN  Yes, very much. 

00:21:50
OTTO KERNBERG Are you still in love with her? 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Yes. I’m still in love. 

00:21:50
OTTO KERNBERG  And, have you tried to contact her? 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN Yes, but they -- after the therapy, we were together. 

00:22:05
[sil.] 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN They, in the emergency center, they decided that she had to go to some place where I could not find her because she felt threatened, and they were afraid that I would do her harm. But it’s not my intention to do her harm, and I tried to find her because we went into the emergency center, because she made the condition, we had -- we have to go find some help because she was pregnant. So -- 

00:22:45
OTTO KERNBERG  I’m a little confused. You said that she left you, one day to the next, leaving a note. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:22:55
OTTO KERNBERG  So how did you get together to the emergency center? 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Before -- before she left me -- it was all arranged in the emergency center with the other therapists and counsel. 

00:23:10
OTTO KERNBERG So she left you -- you’re saying that she left you following the instructions of the therapists? 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:23:15
OTTO KERNBERG And you had gone to the center before that. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:23:20
OTTO KERNBERG And you went there because she suggested? 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN Yes, it was her condition for continuing the relationship. 

00:23:25
OTTO KERNBERG  And why did she want you to go with her to that center, what did she explain to you? 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN She explained to me that she was very insecure about everything, about having the baby, she was very insecure. She was thinking about getting an abortion. And I was very opposed to it. And she was afraid that within our relationship, there wouldn’t be enough room for a baby, for a child. 

00:24:00
OTTO KERNBERG Why not? 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN  She said that I wasn’t giving her enough room, enough space. 

00:24:15
OTTO KERNBERG What did she mean by that? 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN  I’m not sure, but perhaps it was because, in my opinion we had a very close relationship and we were very -- together and, for instance when she was pregnant, it was more of me telling her she was pregnant than she was telling me she was pregnant. I felt like we were pregnant. We were very close to each other. And -- but --. 

00:24:50
OTTO KERNBERG I don’t understand. What do you mean, you told her that she was pregnant? I mean. 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN I noticed some difference. I noticed some difference and I asked her there is something, are you pregnant? And then she realized that some changes were there -- that she was pregnant. 

00:25:15
OTTO KERNBERG  I mean, she did not become aware that she was pregnant? 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN No. 

00:25:20
OTTO KERNBERG  How is it possible? I mean wasn’t there any change in her menstrual period. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Yes, there is, but --. 

00:25:30
OTTO KERNBERG So? 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN : Around that time, I looked at her and I saw you look different, you look different. 

00:25:35
OTTO KERNBERG In what way did she look different? 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN It was -- her skin, her eyes. 

00:25:45
OTTO KERNBERG  So you told her that you thought she was pregnant and then she started thinking that she didn’t have her last menstrual period or what? 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Yes, it was around -- yes, she was – yes, it was around that period. 

00:26:00
OTTO KERNBERG  So well, then she realized she was pregnant and she said -- you said that you didn't give her enough space? 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:26:10
OTTO KERNBERG  And what did she mean by that? 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN That was, yes she said that I was -- a lot of time, I was filling in her thoughts that I was or sometimes I -- because she was very insecure, I always help -- try to help her to be -- to be a -- because she -- a lot of times, she didn't know what she thought or what she felt and a lot of times, I filled in for her too quickly, she said to me. And so I didn't invite her enough to be herself, she said to me. 

00:27:00
OTTO KERNBERG  So she said to you that you were jumping in telling her what she was thinking under condition, but she was not really thinking it. Is that it? 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN : Yes. 

00:27:15
OTTO KERNBERG  So she was saying that you were attributing to her thoughts that she didn't have? 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN : Yes. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:25
OTTO KERNBERG So you thought that you were guessing what she was thinking, but it was really imposing on her your own thoughts. Is that correct? 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, that's how she, she experienced it. 

00:27:40
OTTO KERNBERG Well, when she told you that, how did you react to that? What do you think about that now? 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN First when she told me that, I didn't understand it and I was very angry because she didn't appreciate my love because it was never my intention to 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN In a way, I worshipped her perhaps too much, but I don't know. 

00:28:20
OTTO KERNBERG  Well, but what you're describing now is that you had a very controlling behavior with her, telling her what she was thinking under conditions when she was not thinking that -- am I hear you correctly? 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN : Yes, that's what she -- 

00:28:35
OTTO KERNBERG And she told you that? 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN  In a very -- yes, she told me that, yes. 

00:28:45
OTTO KERNBERG Only on one occasion or very often? 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN : Only with the therapists. 

00:28:50
OTTO KERNBERG (inaudible )? 

00:28:52
UNKNOWN : Only with counselors. Together with counselors. 

00:28:52
OTTO KERNBERG She had never told you that before? 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:28:55
OTTO KERNBERG Had she ever said anything critical to you before or anything about why did she want to go to the councilor in the first place? 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN Because she was afraid that things would go wrong with the baby. Things could go wrong with the three of us. She wasn't -- it was her condition for she said once -- at one time, she said to me that when we don't go to, for -- ask for help, then perhaps I will leave you. 

00:29:40
OTTO KERNBERG  I was asking you how did she get you to go that emergency center in the first place. What else did she tell you? Warranted that you should see a professional? I mean, you told me little earlier that it was only in the emergency center that she told you that you were telling her what she was thinking without her really thinking it. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:30:15
OTTO KERNBERG And that she had not said this to you before, but what did she say -- how did she explain that she wanted to see a professional with you, that she didn't want to have a baby unless you went to the emergency center? 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN  Because I was very happy, with her being pregnant 

00:30:40
OTTO KERNBERG Yes. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN She was very -- at first she was happy, but then after that she was very unhappy about it and she kept thinking about it for, I can do it, we can do it. In a way she panicked and to -- and she thought we needed help and to reassure her, I -- and because she said, I don't what to do and perhaps I'm so afraid of having a baby and to have a baby within our relationship. I said, all right, okay, then we go for help. Let's do it. Let's try it. 

00:31:45
OTTO KERNBERG Why did she say that the two of you had a problem if only she had the panic or fear? So she did not say that you had a problem, she said, she had a problem. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:31:55
OTTO KERNBERG She never complained about anything about you? 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN No, no, that's right and what she and afterwards, I heard a lot of things, but she never told me in the face she felt threatened by me. That was another therapist after she had left another therapist when I found a note, at the same time, there was an invitation of the emergency center that I should come. They would explain to me why she had left and the other therapist told me more. They told me that she had -- she was very scared of me. She was afraid that I would harm her and -- that was -- for me it was, at the time it was devastating because I didn't know what to do and I was very angry then because the therapist were very friendly. In my face, they were very nice, but behind my back, they had other conversations with each other and with the team and they had telephone calls with my girlfriend without me knowing it. 

00:33:15
OTTO KERNBERG  So she never expressed any criticism, any complain, nothing? 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN No. 

00:33:25
OTTO KERNBERG Ever? 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN  No. 

00:33:30
OTTO KERNBERG And the first thing that you knew that she was unhappy with you was that because she was anxious of having the baby. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:35
OTTO KERNBERG And she told you to go to see a therapist together with her? 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:40
OTTO KERNBERG But she said because the two of you together had a problem or not? Did she say that or not? 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN : She said she was afraid that when we were so close to each other that she couldn't imagine there could a room, space for the baby, for the child. 

00:34:05
OTTO KERNBERG I don't quite understand that. Did you understand that when she said there wouldn't be a room for the baby. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN  It wasn't my problem because I thought that of course there is room. 

00:34:20
OTTO KERNBERG But why -- did you understand what she meant by saying there wouldn't room for the baby? 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN Because I know she's very insecure. She had her doubts about almost everything and perhaps, I thought -- and she had in her head somewhere the idea of getting help because she had -- years ago, she had -- she went to a -- she went getting counseling to and that was very good for her. So she had that experience and I said, okay, if you want it, if it's good for you, then it will be good for all of us. 

00:35:05
OTTO KERNBERG So you thought she had problems and therefore she wanted the two of you to go to the emergency? 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:35:15
OTTO KERNBERG She had never said that there was anything about you she was unhappy about? 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN No, no. 

00:35:20
OTTO KERNBERG She never said that to you? 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN No, she never said that. 

00:35:20
OTTO KERNBERG But then, while she was there, she said a lot of things that were critical of you. Is it a fair statement? 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:30
OTTO KERNBERG What else did she say? Did she say that you were telling her what she was thinking without her thinking it? And was -- is that true? Did that actually happen? Once she said this to you, did you think that she was right in that? 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN  No, I didn't -- I didn't think she was right in it and it wasn't her telling me directly. It was the therapist explaining her words to me, saying to me I think your Saskia is saying this to you. And it wasn't her telling me directly. It was all the -- sometimes I was confused about what is the therapist saying and what is my girlfriend saying because sometimes I thought they -- what they accused me of, they were doing themselves, putting words in her mouth and so I -- 

00:36:30
OTTO KERNBERG  So did you have a sense that it were really the therapists who were trying to set her up against you to convince her to leave you? That they were creating artificially problems by convincing her that you had problems? 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN  Yes, because I'm sure that Saskia wouldn't have done it on her own. 

00:37:00
OTTO KERNBERG So then are you really saying that you didn't have any problem in the relationship with her? She was very insecure and then in that emergency center, they convinced her that it was all your fault and she left you? Is that a fair way of putting it? 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN  Afterwards when I think about it, I must have done something wrong. I must have -- something -- that there were things that I haven't noticed within the relationship. 

00:37:35
OTTO KERNBERG Why are you saying that? 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Because afterwards, not at that time, I was very angry and I didn't understand it at all, and now, I don't understand it. I don't understand it completely, but when I think about it, some of the same things -- same things happened in an earlier relationship. So I think -- it's two different girls and almost the same things. So it must have to do something with me. 

00:38:15
OTTO KERNBERG What happened in the earlier relationship? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN  There were more open problems. There were -- it was -- in the earlier relationship, there were more fights, verbal fights and -- but I still don't understand why she chose not investing more in the relationship, but leaving me. 

00:38:50
OTTO KERNBERG  She is the earlier girlfriend? Not, Saskia, the earlier girlfriend? 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN : Not, Saskia, yes. 

00:38:55
OTTO KERNBERG  And she left you without telling you what the problem was? 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:39:00
OTTO KERNBERG  Same as Saskia? 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:39:05
OTTO KERNBERG And the same thing happened with the first girlfriend that you mentioned to me? 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN  But she didn't leave -- my first girlfriend didn't leave me from one day to another. It was a long time that we didn't live together, but we had -- we talked to each other. 

00:39:20
OTTO KERNBERG  Now you told me that the therapists really tried to set her up against you. Is that correct? 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN That was my feeling of it. 

00:39:35
OTTO KERNBERG You're talking about plural. Where there more than one or two? 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN There were two, a man and a woman. 

00:39:40
OTTO KERNBERG There was a man and they saw you together? 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN  They saw us together and afterwards they wanted to see us apart, but we had only -- together, we had only three sessions and between the three sessions, there was one secret session with Saskia. 

00:40:10
OTTO KERNBERG Where both therapists met with Saskia alone? 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN  That one time, yes. 

00:40:15
OTTO KERNBERG And did they meet with you alone also? 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN Afterwards they did because in the one session where we were apart and the therapist told me that Saskia asked for the session. I'm not sure about it. I'm not sure about it if Saskia asked for the session, because I've -- 

00:40:35
OTTO KERNBERG  Originally, they were only going to see you jointly, but then --? 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN It was one of my conditions, because I didn't want to be separated. 

00:40:50
OTTO KERNBERG You didn't want -- you mean you didn't want for her to have sessions at which you were not present? 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:40:55
OTTO KERNBERG Why not? 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN  Because I was hoping that she would be -- she could be herself with, together with me. 

00:41:15
OTTO KERNBERG No, but why wouldn't she be able to have separate session by herself? Maybe there were things that she had difficulties saying in a joint session and the private session could give her a chance to say things that she would have difficulties saying otherwise. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:41:35
OTTO KERNBERG We only have ten minutes left. I underestimated how long it would take to get to a crucial point. I don't know whether you already guessed or not that this patient really hit her, broke her finger and was keeping that from me and finally he mentioned it as I very gradually and carefully forced him to deal with this while at the same time evaluating to what extend the patient had the paranoid delusion about a conspiracy against him by the therapist. So finally it came out. He had broken her finger. She was afraid of him and he was oscillating between thinking that, that was minor thing and no reason for his leaving him and another part of him that understood that she was afraid that he would hit her even further that she was at danger. The therapist thought she was at danger and had to separate. So the last part of the session, I asked him there were two views, which one was a conspiracy and perhaps I was part of the conspirators and the other was that he had a problem with women, became violent with women and that he needed treatment for that. What did he think? So I ventilate, I test that reality testing and at the end it was clear that he was aware he had a problem. He was afraid of being despised, depreciated and attacked and left -- the end -- we only have about ten minutes left. I will try to show you one segment of that part of the session. I'm sorry that you couldn't see more, but I hope what you saw illustrated my starting with symptoms, immediately going into main life problem, immediately being faced with a vagueness, a confusion at a distrust that required the testing of reality testing. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN I don't understand why -- 

00:43:40
OTTO KERNBERG  How do you understand that Saskia should so easily be moved by one meeting with that women, biased against you to leave you? And you had been living together for four years. It was enough to have one session alone with that women and she decided to leave you. Isn't that strange? 

00:44:05
UNKNOWN I'm afraid it had to do with one little incident, one little accident that -- 

00:44:20
[sil.] 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN To be honest, we had a little fight and accidently she broke her finger and I think that was the reason why the other women, the other therapist convinced her to leave me because that I would physically hurt her. 

00:44:55
OTTO KERNBERG How did she break her finger? 

00:45:00
[sil.] 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN I don't remember exactly because I -- it was not and I tried to explain it and I apologized for it because it was never my intention to break her finger. It was not -- 

00:45:30
[sil.] 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN But at that time I was very scared because she was having secret thoughts she wasn't sharing with me. I knew it. I felt that she was hiding something and it made me -- at that time, it made me very angry and I wanted to -- perhaps, I wanted to force her to tell me the truth. 

00:46:05
OTTO KERNBERG So did you attack her physically? 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN  I did realize that my -- that I held her so strongly. 

00:46:15
OTTO KERNBERG And, so you contributed to her breaking her finger? 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:46:20
OTTO KERNBERG How did you do that? 

00:46:25
[sil.] 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Because she wanted to run away and I held to her finger and then she made a turn and -- 

00:46:40
[sil.] 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN And I was very sorry for it because it was not my intention to hurt her. 

00:46:50
OTTO KERNBERG So, in fact you broke her finger. Is that a fair statement? 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:46:55
OTTO KERNBERG  And has this been -- you said there was one accident, referring to this situation. Had there been other situation like this before? Have you been at moment when you were very angry tempted or involved in hitting her or attacking her physically? 

00:47:20
[sil.] 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN No, not really, not really. Not like this incident. 

00:47:30
OTTO KERNBERG But, have you been hitting her, had you been hitting her before that? 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN  No, maybe once or twice, slapping her face or something but not very often. 

00:47:45
OTTO KERNBERG  How often? Once a day, once a week, once a month? 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN No, no, no. 

00:47:50
OTTO KERNBERG  Roughly? 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Yes. I think about three or four times within the four years. 

00:48:00
OTTO KERNBERG  And, has this been a problem also in your earlier relationship with the other women that you mentioned that you would hit them when you were very angry? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN  No, sometimes. It's hard for me to -- when I'm angry, sometimes it's hard for me to control myself. I know that. That's the problem. 

00:48:25
OTTO KERNBERG We only have two minutes left. And there are still about, I think about 20 minutes left of the interview. What I tried to do at that point is raise the question to what extent he realizes that that was dangerous behavior that explained the fear of women and that reflected a problem of his, but to what extend he felt that her reaction and that of the other women was exaggerated and teams was exaggerated and the world wasn't a conspiracy against him. So my attitude was technically neutral. I hope you realize that I didn't act like a District Attorney. I didn't try to be falsely friendly. I was -- this is a technical neutrality means a concerned objectivity, an effort to find out what is going on to be able to reach a diagnosis and then help the patient to receive the treatment that he needs. My final conclusion here was that this patient suffered from paranoid personality with borderline personality organization, severe conflicts with women and sadistic behavior with women under conditions when his paranoid tendencies were activated and that this man needed of course treatment. At the same time, he needed to come to terms with the fact that her leaving him and the team trying to protect her from him was totally realistic under the conditions without his feeling that he was being attacked by society. So we have here the treatment of a person with very severe paranoid pathology and potential violence and one question, important question that I tried to clarify in the rest of the interview is how much he had the capacity for an ordinary contrums(ph) for guilt feelings or not because that of course is prognostically crucial. Was this a psychopath who was playing innocent or was he a paranoid personality who was rationalizing his aggression while still maintaining a basic identity with moral values? That part of the interview I can't show you but I hope I've illustrated that this interview permits a relative fast decision and diagnosis about difficult cases who are very often either escape the reality -- have the therapist escape the reality of what is going on or feels so persecuted in a psychological examination that they don't ever show up for treatment. Thank you for your attention.
