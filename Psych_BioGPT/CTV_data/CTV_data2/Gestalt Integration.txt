These demonstrations are for professional training and for use in skill, theories, multicultural, and practicum/internship courses. The demonstrations present situations that viewers may encounter in real life. All demonstrations are role-played with volunteers who gave their informed consent and willingness to be videotaped.

Influencing Skills: Strategies For Change Carlos Zalaquett, Ph.D., Lic. Seriashia Chatters, Doctoral student 

00:00:00
Gestalt Integration: Internal parts, polarities, and dichotomies produce stress and interfere with decision making. Establishing communication between these parts help clients integrate even unwanted parts of self and facilitate growth and progress. 

00:00:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Good to see you again, Seriashia, um, welcome back. 

00:00:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Thank you, um, thank you. It's good to see you too. 

00:00:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT We, um, decided last time that we wanted to focus on a particular aspect of your experience growing up 

00:01:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. 

00:01:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, uh, um, you wanted to see if there was a way to, um, create an impact effect positively that situation. Please describe the situation again, so we can start from there. 

00:01:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, um, I've just been having some issues lately with, um, being legally blind and not being able to transport myself from place to place, and sometimes it makes me feel a little bit inadequate and want to give up because it's really difficult, um, to try to do all the things that I do, um, and I feel as if I'm a burden to other people. And so I just wanted some help with that, because I've just been having some difficulty with those feelings, and it's making me feel as if I just want to give up at times. 

00:01:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Just give up. 

00:01:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:01:45
Interview starts with strengths 

00:01:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, for what I've learned from you on the previous sessions, is that you have been very successful in what you do. 

00:01:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:01:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You are a educated woman. 

00:01:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:01:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You know, from a diverse background. 

00:02:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:02:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Who can accomplish, or has accomplished, a number of different academic degrees, and is at the brink of another one. 

00:02:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:02:05
Counselor introduces Gestalt therapy 

00:02:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So as we spoke, my impression is that, is like there are like two different dimensions here, two different, what gestaltist, uh, therapists call parts. 

00:02:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:02:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And they are in some sort of a, of a polarity type of position. 

00:02:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:02:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So being as it is, I will, uh, ask you permission to work with an experiential technique, a Gestalt-based technique, although modified as you will see at the end. 

00:02:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:02:35
Obtaining permission for a new strategy 

00:02:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT But, um, would you like to, to try a different technique today? 

00:02:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Sure, I, I definitely would like to try something. 

00:02:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. This is what I'm going to ask you to do. 

00:02:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:02:45
Relaxation helps bring client to here and now 

00:02:45
Imagery Directive 

00:02:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I'm going to ask you to take a deep breath in and out. Very good. To relax your shoulders and your body. And I'm going to ask you to, uh, put your hands on your lap, in this way. Very good. Let your feet rest on the floor, comfortably. Make sure your back is comfortable, also. And now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes, turn your hands upside down. Very good. And I'm going to ask you to use your imagination, to picture in one of those hands, an image of yourself, an image of Seriashia concerned about her visual limitation. And whenever you picture this image of yourself, just take a moment to share with me, how does you look like, what is her, her attitude, and what is your sense of her? 

00:03:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, she is crouched in a corner, and she is scared, and wants to give up, and she looks very tired. 

00:04:05
[sil.] 

00:04:05
Next, Carlos introduces a dialogue of parts. We have already seen a strong capable woman who is also scared and tired. Note the use of hands. 

00:04:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very tired. Thank you very much. This was a very, very good representation and I could sense that I have like a, an understand to some extent of what is going on. Now, uh, on your left hand there. 

00:04:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:04:25
Guiding a dialogue of internal parts 

00:04:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You know, picture an image of yourself as a woman who has accomplished all these different academic achievements and other achievements in life. 

00:04:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:04:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How does you look like? You know, what is your position in that image? And what's your sense about her? 

00:04:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well she is standing very tall, and she's got her arms crossed, and she's looking like she's very upset with the other part of myself. And, um, she is, definitely seems very distinguished and just irritated. 

00:05:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Irritated. So allow me to invite you to continue exploring this conversation by letting the person, the Seriashia on your left hand to look at the Seriashia on the right hand and to let the Seriashia on the right hand to look on the one on the left hand . How do they feel about one another? What would they like to say about one another? And once you notice that , let one of them tell the other one how does she see her, how does she likes her, and what would she like for her to do? 

00:06:00
Here and now awareness of experience 

00:06:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, the Seriashia on this hand, looks at this Seriashia, and says that she would like her to get up and stop feeling sorry for herself. And she doesn't like it when she sits and feels sorry for herself, because there are too many things to do , and there's no time for her to be feeling that way. 

00:06:20
[sil.] 

00:06:20
In the following, note the flow between hands as Seria moves to a Gestalt integration. The Gestalt "empty chair" strategy could achieve the same objective. 

00:06:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Now, let's repeat that (inaudible ) in, in, in, in first person, as if the Seriashia on that hand, you know, is verbally addressing the other one. "I don't like the way you," "I would like for you to," using a first person communication and direct communication between the Seriashias. 

00:06:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I don't like the way that you are sitting in the corner feeling sorry for yourself. There is no time for this. You need to get up, and you need to get going, because we have too many things to do, and there is no time for you to feel sorry for yourself. 

00:07:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How does the, the, the, the Seriashia on the right hand, you know, reacts to that? How does she feels, and what would you like to say to respond to that? 

00:07:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I'm tired of you bullying me, and I'm tired. I'm just tired of always having to ask everyone to do things for me. And there's so many things I can't do for myself and I wish that you would just leave me alone. 

00:07:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How does the other one react to that? And what would you like to say in reply? 

00:07:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I can't leave you alone because if I leave you alone, you would be left to do nothing. And you have a lot of support around you and yes, you can't do a lot of things yourself, but you're lucky enough to have other people to do them for you. And you need to get up because there is no time for this. 

00:08:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How does the other Seriashia respond to that? 

00:08:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Every once in a while, I would like to feel sorry for myself. And I would like some time to sit back, and to be who I am, and I don't need you bullying me. 

00:08:15
Notice the counselor's frequent use of encouragers. 

00:08:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm. Allow the dialog to continue. What would the other Seriashia respond to that? 

00:08:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS That, I understand that you need that time, but the thing about it is that, while you have people around, while you have the ability to get to and from where you need to go, you need to take advantage of it, and you need to stop the wallowing. 

00:08:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. 

00:08:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And this Seriashia would say that I, I understand that, and every once in a while though, I do feel that way, when things get really difficult. 

00:09:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm. 

00:09:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS But I do understand that I do need to get up, and I do need to do what it is that I need to do. But sometimes it's just really hard and I need help. 

00:09:10
Note counselor's use of "I" as he tunes in with client experience. 

00:09:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Let's hear you repeat that last part. 

00:09:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I need help! 

00:09:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (crosstalk) Sometimes it's really hard and- I need help, yes? 

00:09:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I need help. 

00:09:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. What, what, what is the other Seriashia's reaction to that? 

00:09:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, I don't think that she's angry anymore, but she would say that I understand that you need help, and I can help you, that's what I'm trying to do. 

00:09:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Now let me ask you to, uh, open your eyes for a second, uh, and and, look at your hands as if you were looking at them from your mind's eye. And, uh, what did you notice? What did you notice about this conversation so far? 

00:09:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I noticed that the two, the two parts of me seem to be getting closer together. 

00:09:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. Very good. 

00:09:55
Client starts a Gestalt integration 

00:09:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And that, um, even though there are two different parts of me that it just seems as if, uh, it's easier to handle things but right now they're separated, but it would be easier to handle things if they were to support one another. 

00:10:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. And what do you think that keeps, uh, them separate? 

00:10:10
Good insight and awareness 

00:10:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Just the feeling of one feeling as if the other will, won't get it together, and the other one feeling as if this Seriashia is just not allowing her the time to just be down every once in a while. 

00:10:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:10:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And so I think that there is a difference of understanding. A difference of opinion. 

00:10:35
Top dog - Underdog 

00:10:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. In Gestalt terms, we call this a Top Dog - Underdog type of communication. 

00:10:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:10:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT There's a dominant part, and a submissive part, which in reality, they are both assets and resources of ourselves if we can get them to work together. 

00:10:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:10:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So help me, uh, accomplish some of that, by, uh, intervening, mediating in this conversation. 

00:11:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:11:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, uh, close your eyes again and notice that so far they have told one another things, feelings, what they see. 

00:11:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:11:10
Move to emotions 

00:11:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And allow yourself now to engage in noticing how each one of them feel with this relationship and from that feeling, allow either one to begin by saying "I will appreciate," or "I would like you to." 

00:11:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I would you to take less time in the negative, and take more time positively thinking about things, and to appreciate what it is that you have around you. 

00:11:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay, what would the other Seriashia respond with, on the right hand? 

00:11:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I would like you to help me do that. 

00:11:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm. Allow themselves to look at one another. And what would they like to sort of really, really ask from one another? 

00:12:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS This one would say that I need your help to be a better person and I need your help to be stronger and this one would say that I would like to help you. 

00:12:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (crosstalk) Uh-huh. It would like to help. 

00:12:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:12:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. Very good. And I can see that your hands are getting closer to one another. 

00:12:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:12:25
Encouraging Gestalt integration 

00:12:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, let's complete this experience by allowing yourself to get your hands closer and closer to one another, just, just observing what happened with each one of them as you get your hands closer and closer. And take your time to observe your images getting together in one folding hand. And once you allow this experience to complete itself, allow your hands to go back to your chest, slowly, and embrace both of these Seriashias. And take a moment to, to, to feel, integrate, complete this experience. And once you have done that, take a deep breath in and out, open your eyes, and refocus here. Very good. How'd it go? 

00:13:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Peaceful. 

00:13:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Sorry. 

00:13:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Peaceful. 

00:13:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Peaceful. 

00:13:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. 

00:13:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. 

00:13:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS It feels as if there was a battle going on and now there is a consensus as to how things should go. I don't feel as, uh, I don't feel as embattled as I felt before I came. I just couldn't understand why I couldn't just be, and be happy with how things were, and . . . 

00:14:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT In, in Gestaltist terms. 

00:14:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:14:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT The polarity has been transformed into parts. Both our strength and our weaknesses are important to us. In a sense, when I ask people you would like to be an elephant or a flea, people believe that the right answer is to chose one of them. 

00:14:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:14:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT In reality, you want to be both. They are both part of you. 

00:14:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:14:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And they are both Seriashia. They tend to polarize from one another, and to get into what is called an internal conflict of parts. 

00:15:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:15:00
All parts are potential resources 

00:15:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT As you get them to dialogue, they get to know each other, they share strengths and resources, and as you embrace them, those resources become available to you. And in a sense, there are moments in which you really need to ask for help, and that's great, and there are moments when you can function by yourself, autonomously, and that's great too. And all of that is you. 

00:15:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. It makes a lot of sense now. 

00:15:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good, very good. Good work. 

00:15:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Thank you. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:35
The client has developed new awareness about internal parts of her personality, owned them, and integrated them into a new whole. By achieving this the client is more complete, more at peace and more able to rely on her natural strengths to live a more fulfilling and successful life. 

00:15:35
Gestalt Integration: Internal parts, polarities, and dichotomies produce stress and interfere with decision making. Establishing communication between these parts help client integrate even unwanted parts of self and facilitate growth and progress. 

00:15:35
Gestalt Integration: Internal Parts Dialogue is one of the Gestalt techniques used to integrate conflicting parts of the self and benefit from their combined strengths.
