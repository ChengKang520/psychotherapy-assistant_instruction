FRANK WILLS Hello I'm Frank Wills and I'm delighted to be and also welcome Dorothy Rowe to the School of Social Studies in the University of Wales, Newport today. Dorothy has come to talk to us about her ideas on depression and its treatments. And this is part of our series of ongoing interviews with people who have shaped the developments of counseling in Britain. One of the biggest changes in the mental health field in Britain over the last 50 years has probably been the way that people with depression are treated. 50 years ago, a person coming forward for help with depression would probably only have been offered drug treatment by a psychiatrist. Maybe a very few people would have been offered some kind of psychoanalytical therapy again delivered by a psychiatrist. This medical monopoly was justified at that time by several assumptions. Firstly, the fact that it was believed that depression itself was a medical organic problem. Secondly, therefore that this medical organic problem had to be treated in a medical organic fashion. Thirdly that such treatment should be administered or supervised by a psychiatrist and fourthly that the clients or patient themselves had very little active role in this treatment. These assumptions were obviously challenged and Dorothy Rowe played a prominent role in challenging both the conceptions of the nature of depression and also about the way that people with that problem were best helped. I'm particularly interested to able to talk to Dorothy today because I myself have a major interest in understanding and working with depression. And I will be fascinated to compare her ideas and experiences of that field with my own. Okay then so let's watch the video. Dorothy can I wish you a very… very warm welcome to Wales today. As you know we, we've been having a series of interviews and really we are interested to you know explore people who have been influential and their ideas and really a bit where their ideas had come from. So can we start right to the start really. Can you tell me a little bit about you know your, your early life in Australia and maybe what influence that had. 

00:03:35
DOROTHY ROWE I was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia in 1930. And that was a quite a difficult time that was in the midst of the great depression. And I'm born into a family that had lots of stresses and strains in it. At the time nobody would have had used the word depression or depressed. And it wasn't until I had come to England and was working with people with that diagnosis. And I found myself having these conversation with my mother. These women all had similar ideas to her and, and then when I thought about her I realized that she would have been depressed. I was also born on my sister's sixth birthday and that was definitely the worst career move I ever made. 

00:04:35
FRANK WILLS And yeah I got that although you're saying your mom was depressed. Your dad was more on the kind of optimistic side. 

00:04:40
DOROTHY ROWE Yes and it was at the time it was just you know that was my family. But many years later, I realized how lucky I was to have parents who were not consistent. Because if you have consistent parents who always say the same thing to you. You grow up believing that there is one right way of seeing the world and if you don't see it like that then something wrong with you. Well I was spared that because whenever something happened my mother would produce an interpretation which was always as black and pessimistic as it could possibly be. And then my father would produce a totally optimistic interpretation and my sister's interpretation was along the lines of was that of any important to her and if wasn't it didn't happen. And of course I had my interpretation, so I knew I never lost the knowledge that people cannot help but have their own of seeing things. So really right from birth I was a personal construct psychologist. 

00:05:55
FRANK WILLS Ha…ha…ha… So… so you were introduced easily to the idea of, of multiple perspectives right that is what you say? 

00:06:05
DOROTHY ROWE No it wasn't really a introduction, it was just that having ploughed my way through all kinds of ridiculous psychology theories in the course of my education. When I had lost in 1968 encountered Don Bannister and Phil Salmon and Fay Fransella and Miller Mair and they talked about personal construct psychology. I thought at last psychologist have created a theory which actually relates to real people. 

00:06:40
FRANK WILLS Okay and I know that psychology wasn't your first profession although it was your, your first degree I think wasn't it. 

00:06:45
DOROTHY ROWE Yes my first degree was at Sydney University in psychology, but although I had won an exhibition at the university, my parents couldn't afford to pay for me just to go, my (inaudible ) and so I took a teacher’s college scholarship which meant that I had to teach for five years after graduating. And so I, I did my teaching certificate, teaching diploma and taught for few years. And then I taught for about five years and, and that was interrupted and I got married and had, had my son Edward. And, and then when I went back teaching when Edward was two. I was invited to train as an educational psychologist and I didn’t take up that invitation for two years. But when I did I just thought it was wonderful, tremendously hard work doing this whole year training, packed tight with all sorts of interesting things. But I found that to me standing in front of a class of 40 normal 15-year-old was terrifying whereas one psychotic child was easy. 

00:08:10
FRANK WILLS Right so you, you kind of came into psychology with a slightly in towards the educationalist fear, but at some stage you switch into clinical. 

00:08:20
DOROTHY ROWE Well and when I was, I was working what still called out there are school counselors and educational psychologist. And that there were counselors who specialized with different groups of children with special needs. And I was asked to be specialist counselor for emotionally disturbed children. And I realized that I simply didn’t have the background to do that and so I did my diploma of clinical psychology at Sydney University at night and then worked during the day. And that was very much a psychoanalytic course. We did lots of testing you know real shock and TAT and, and studied Otto Fenichel's psychoanalytic theory of the neurosis. We also did lot of work on brain damage and, and all of that was, was and I’ve really enjoyed it. It just opened up all sorts of doors for me just in shear interest of wanting to find out about it. And then in about 1965 my marriage came to an end. And, and by that time I was doing some work at the University of New South Wales towards a master’s degree. And I was corresponding with Monte Shapiro at the Institute Of Psychiatry. And in one letter he, he just happen to say why don’t you come over here there is lots of work for psychologist. And I didn’t have the money at all and I had a child to support. But I cashed in my superannuation, long service leave and we got a ship, a boat over to, to Europe. And when we got there, I got a job at Whiteley Wood Clinic, which was a clinic attached to the Department Of Psychiatry at Sheffield University. And that was quite hard going the first year are so, but it, it was an extraordinary education for me and that’s was where I did my PhD. 

00:10:45
FRANK WILLS Right okay that’s good and that's takes us then into you know your one of your major professional interest in… understanding of depression and how to work well with depression so on. And I want to find just before we kind of go into that and talk about your research and what came out of that. Just if I could make a personal comment, just about the personal construct perspective that you talk about. Because it rings a lot of bells with me because about the same time which you are making this move I was making my initial entry into psychological therapy if you like. And I actually worked in… was then called a Child Guidance Clinic. And, and we had some very, very psychoanalytic psychiatrists and some very behavioral psychologists and I was kind of in the middle. And I remember actually I read it in Greece in fact on holiday in nice hot sun reading Don Banister’s book. I think it was Don and Fay Fransella’s book I can’t remember the title now. And you know when they put forth this idea of, of personal constructs and how it for me just answered the inadequacies of the other two things that I have been introduced you know. 

00:12:10
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:12:10
FRANK WILLS I just want to you (inaudible ). 

00:12:15
DOROTHY ROWE Well the best way to understand personal construct theory is that it’s a measure theory. It explains, it accounts for all different theories we have in psychology. Because all the different theories whatever the language, the names given to them. They are all theories about how human beings create meaning that’s what we are in essence. We are meaning creating creatures. And what determines what we do isn’t what happens to us, but how we interpret what happens to us. No psychologist should ever make statements like people behave like this because they are poor, poverty drives them to it or worse genes cause behavior. Psychologist should understand that all their theories are about how we interpret, what happens to us. And the thing about psychoanalysis through Freudian analysis and Freud had wonderful insights and his daughter Anna studies of children, a brilliant. But Freud wanted to have a nice little close job, so that only special people could belong to it and the way he did that as what lots of psychologist and psychiatrist do is to have up jargon of great big words and phrases and oh! yes we understand there is nobody else does. So to, to work in a psychoanalytic framework if you work in this someone who is a psychoanalyst you hope that they will talk in ordinary language because if they do they will say great things, but if they stick to their jargon it’s impenetrable. And the thing about cognitive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy is that it’s not really built on any kind of theory of understanding because Aaron Beck didn’t want to go into that. He had trained as a psychoanalyst and he could see that… that was too complex, too difficult for everyday use and so he made some rules. We are not going to talk about anything theoretical so we are not going to develop a theory of, of dysfunctional ideas. And also he forbade his disciples to ever to let their clients talk about death or the meaning of life. So if you exclude those three, you end up with a technique that isn’t based on the theory. And but basically, cognitive behavioral therapy is about how people create meaning and how that meaning determines what they do, change the meaning you change the behavior. 

00:15:30
FRANK WILLS Which relates very directly to the statement you make about personal construes and you know you remind us to something you mentioned to me earlier that none of these ideas are exactly new because you kind of quoted a big data's from 1980’s as a way of getting into. 

00:15:50
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:15:50
FRANK WILLS And what about the behavioral side. 

00:15:55
DOROTHY ROWE Again the behavioral has been real (inaudible ) for as long as our spaces of being taming animals that had been using behavior. You know behavior therapy, behavior management and we have been taming animals for quite a while. And, and so, so the principles of behavior therapy have been long understood and certainly used in brining up children. It is not always been a good understanding of what children regard us or reward or punishment and lot of behavior therapist suggest this ignorant about that as any, any parent outside. But because to understand what a reward or a punishment is you have to see it from the person’s point of view. A reward is a reward only if the person thinks it's a reward. A lot of work has been done in behavior studies as been the psychologist deciding what’s the reward and that’s meaningless. 

00:17:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah okay so you, you had a great interest than in personal construes and then you became engaged in this research, it was Sheffield I think wasn't it… 

00:17:10
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:17:15
FRANK WILLS And you know you, you given license how I read it to go… to… to a lots of people who were depressed and… 

00:17:25
DOROTHY ROWE Yes, well the professor of psychiatry in Sheffield when I first went then was Alec Jenner. And Alec had been given a huge research grant to discover the biological bases of mood change. And he would gather us all around him and he would tell us how he was going to discover the biological change that caused mania and depression. And then he was going to create a pill that would straighten it all out and then he would win the Nobel Prize and we would all live happily thereafter. Well after 10 years the research grant was taken away from him because he had discovered, he and his team had discovered a number of important physiological things. But he had given up his belief that you can explain depression and mania just in terms of biochemistry. And Alec who is emeritus professor now has said to me some really nice things about my work, which I won't repeat out of modesty, but I treasure them greatly. And I treasure his words because not many people can bear to lose the theory that they were going to make their name on. We know, all know lots of psychologist and psychiatrists and other scientists who will go on to the crack of doom trying to prove their theory rather than admit they were wrong and Alec as one of those people who has got them, he just wants to know what, what happened. 

00:19:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah he was truly empirical. 

00:19:15
DOROTHY ROWE Yes and, and he, he would say now that of course biology plays an enormous part in, in what we do. But it doesn’t determine totally what we do. 

00:19:30
FRANK WILLS I think if you says somewhere, there is never been any consistent finding of a, of a an, an organic predecessor to, to depression. 

00:19:40
DOROTHY ROWE Well David Healy has pointed that out in his last book Let Them Eat Prozac. There is no research which shows any evidence of why change in the serotonin levels in a brain of a depressed person. And this certainly has any evidence of any kind of biological change preceding depression. And everybody knows that correlation is not a course, a course has to precede. So there is no evidence that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance but that myth as David calls it has pedaled all the time. 

00:20:25
FRANK WILLS So, so you went to this research then with, with an open mind. But also with the use very useful theoretical tool about how to divine people’s construes. So can you tell me what you’ve had in the past 

00:20:40
DOROTHY ROWE Well I didn’t start off with this full theory. 

00:20:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:20:40
DOROTHY ROWE Because I, the work I was doing was in Whiteley Wood Clinic and at Middlewood, terrible old hospital in Sheffield. I was with people who were severely depressed. I get the impression nowadays that a lot of this the practices in cognitive therapy are worked out with people who are mildly depressed because people who regarded as you know leaders in the field of cognitive therapy will hold, will prescribe certain ways of dealing with someone with depression that simply not it really wouldn’t work with somebody who is deeply depressed. It would be down right cruel to do it. Someone who is so depressed that to get out of bed in the morning is a major active courage. To expect that person to get out of bed and carry on a program and do homework is just shear cruelty and claim stupid. But I work with or met, talked with people who are so deeply depressed and if somebody could have given them a magic pill to make them better would have thought that was wonderful that as I worked with them and just talk with them watched what happened. I could see the pills didn’t change things. You know pills don’t change an unhappy marriage into a happy one. They don’t change any of the circumstances of your life. And they don’t change your past. So it had to be been a something else. And I could see two in talking with these different depressed people how different they look on life was for mine. And it was in lots of ways like my mother and was totally despairing and angry and totally pessimistic. And that wasn’t the illness talking that was the way they thought all the time. 

00:22:55
FRANK WILLS So, so that these were the kind of you know the bases of the construes which you… 

00:23:00
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:23:00
FRANK WILLS You know clarified as being, being important since then the point about anger here is known. This is something I have hurt you talk about if I had hurting. You refer to certainly other people regarding he was cantankerous. I mean it was the word you used. So but I, I can’t get the feeling from what I read, what I have had you say and what I read is that you just see a value in anger you know and may be as something of a protection against something like depression you know. And the idea of complaints I think is also something that you… 

00:23:35
DOROTHY ROWE Well, if, if we didn’t get angry when we are frustrated, (inaudible ) would have gone nowhere or is up into go very far (inaudible ). But you know when we arrived on this planet we have small puny in comparison to some of the fierce animals in that circumstances. We found ourselves in, but it is that anger is a natural response to frustration. That the problem with anger is that we have to live in groups. We don’t do very well if we live totally on our own and anger threatens to disrupt relationship. So it’s a question of how do you deal with anger and we are not terribly good dealing with that because most of us as children are punished for getting angry, certainly getting angry with grownups. And, and we are not taught to workout ways of expressing our anger. And that will be effective and not make the situation worse, but allow us to defend us ourselves, stand up for ourselves. And, and often said of depression on many people that it’s anger turned inwards. But a depressed person isn’t sitting there being only(ph) miserable. They are miserable alright but they are also very angry. They are angry with themselves and they are angry with the events the people that have led them to the situation but they don’t dare express that anger, accept in certain ways. You know if you have to live with someone who is depressed you know their angry. 

00:25:30
FRANK WILLS I was thinking also you know about the time that you were doing that research and then I think I’m right in saying that the, the published book that you brought out in relation to the word came out about 10 years after actually in 1978. But around that time, there was quite a, a vigorous anti-psychiatry movements around, I don’t know if quite vigorous but it was… there was an, there was a… a theme around about anti-psychiatry. I wonder what you think about that naturally? 

00:26:00
DOROTHY ROWE Well there was… (inaudible ) in here and, and what he was saying about madness, schizophrenia doesn’t just appear that there is something to do with the family relationships. And, and of course this creates all sorts of problems because this a feeling that you mustn’t criticize your parents. And, and, and of course once you become a parent you're, you're very prone to guilt and anxiety about what you’ve done. So we still haven’t faced up to, to that issues about what happens to children in families. I mean the whole thing about mental disorder being caused by genes as a great way of avoiding facing up to the fact that we can’t live… we have to raise children. Children need to be raised in a family but it is a very dangerous place to be raised. And it’s very, very difficult to know how to bring up a child because the difficulty is that it’s not what you as a parent do that determines how your child turns out. But it’s how your child interprets what you do that determines your child’s behavior and you’ve got no control over that sad thing being a parent. 

00:27:30
FRANK WILLS And where to at this time you know you became a psychologist in Lincolnshire and eventually you became I think the head psychologist there, before that yeah. 

00:27:40
DOROTHY ROWE I went over there to create a Department of Psychology they hadn't been any there. And our area went from the Humber to The Wash which meant we traveled all around this now little old cars. It’s a large bleak empty… 

00:28:00
FRANK WILLS (Crosstalk) And you know again reflecting my, my own career round about this time. I was referring to before the, the psychoanalytic psychiatrist and the behavioral psychologists who, who I was working with. And there was quite a you know fairly open warfare between the two struggle for control and so forth at that time. 

00:28:25
DOROTHY ROWE When you were working in Child Guidance Clinic. So you were working with child psychiatrists and they use to have that and still. They use to have psychoanalytic training that was their background that for a psychiatrists who went in to work with adults, they didn’t know any of that nonsense. They just been learned the names of the mental illnesses, the pills and the amount of ECT you gave them that was it. And they could do that quite easily because they had a junior doctor do it and they had… led a very nice quite life. And, and if they are interested in farming well they could supervise the farm otherwise they took up golf. And but there were very jealous of their position and the reason that we psychologists a little group of five came to Lincolnshire was that the administrator of the that, that was the mental illness hospital, and psychiatric hospitals and the mental handicapped hospitals as they were called then, was concerned about the state of the mental handicap hospitals. And, and so he got us psychologists to come in and start working in the mental handicapped hospitals where there are lot of people who had been put away for no good reason. And then we started doing work with in the psychiatric hospitals, but most of the psychiatrists, they all didn’t understand why we were there but they discovered that they could dispose of some of their more troublesome patients. (crosstalk)(inaudible ). So a referral would be a phone call for other psychiatrists and he would say "Dorothy I've got this chap I really can’t stand him could you people see him." And I would yes and that, that was the referral and it was a very interesting life. I look back on it now as the golden age of the NHS, because I had an enormous teaching gadget(ph) and we use to go often in all sorts of interesting things because this was when all these different therapies were coming in the 70’s. Art therapy and music therapy, transactional analysis and drama therapy. Oh it's lovely. 

00:31:00
FRANK WILLS In a way if we, if we took a sort of overview of that what we begin with is the psychiatrist of different use as you say, having a pretty stranglehold… 

00:31:15
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:31:15
FRANK WILLS …on, on what was going on. But also a lot of other professions starting to come in and say I could do things that and you know obviously somehow a little bit of struggle and power struggle going on about you know how that would shape down. 

00:31:35
DOROTHY ROWE In the late 70’s psychiatric nursing started to change because up till then in the psychiatric and mental handicap hospital to get a job you needed to be a man need to be six foot tall because that was how you kept the patient in order. 

00:31:50
DOROTHY ROWE Yes, yes. 

00:31:50
FRANK WILLS And the woman had to be pretty tough too. But with now with psychiatric drugs they had then that were quite difficult patients. You didn’t have to run (inaudible ) strength to keep them quite and put them in a straight jacket. And, and so some of the more thoughtful nurses and there were some wonderful nurses started to come and talk to us and come to the workshops in Stafford we were organizing and the Royal College of Nurses produced a syllabus for psychiatric nurses training and one of the consultant St. John’s, it was heard to say "Dorothy Rowe wrote that." And it was simply saying, simple things that nurses should actually sit and talk with the patient and found out about them and think about them as people. 

00:32:50
FRANK WILLS You've raised up horrible thought for me Dorothy because my first job actually was a psychiatric social worker and I just realized I probably only got the job on the basis I'm six foot tall. 

00:33:00
DOROTHY ROWE But you can look after… 

00:33:05
FRANK WILLS I didn’t realize it, but it also remained me of the very first piece of therapeutic advice I ever had which was and this was from one of these old, old lag really I think if mental health workers as he only said to me, he said don't forget son he said. When you go and you’re doing a home visit and you knock on the door and then you step aside because sometimes they come running out straight to get. It was the very first obviously it really was the very first piece of therapeutic I was ever given. So, so what I, you know I associate you with the kind of the movements have broaden this out you know to bring other people in psychology (inaudible ). But also you know acknowledging people like maybe social workers and nurses and… and counselors is that how you see. 

00:33:55
DOROTHY ROWE Oh yes because you know in the Department of Psychology we started having a sort of a weekly group for us just to sit around and talk. And, and then various other people joined us, some of the nurses. And the… there was, the present chaplain came and joined us. And he was also working in what was then still called marriage guidance. And, and then he went on to train as a counselor and become student counselor at Cambridge University. So, so there were people coming through who were thinking that this was interesting I want to find out more about it and then gradually they were one or two counseling courses and things are starting up and so the whole counseling thing grew like a great big mushroom. 

00:34:55
FRANK WILLS And in a way what, what, what united all these um… alternative groups if you like was the belief that um… you know the organic side of depression or whatever problem was only a part of it, you know as far from that… 

00:35:10
DOROTHY ROWE I… I would… 

00:35:10
FRANK WILLS …a complete explanation of, of, what… 

00:35:10
DOROTHY ROWE I would think the… if you actually went into those veil places they were called psychiatric hospitals. And so, what went on then, you didn't have to know anything about the theory that these people had some organ… something organic wrong with them, you would just go in there and say that human being shouldn't live like this, it is no wonder these people behave bizarrely, anybody would behave bizarrely, if they were living in these horrible, horrible conditions. And so, it was that, and recognizing if you talk to any of the people who were lopped up there, the patient, they were ordinary human beings. Terrible things had happened to them, but terrible things have always been happening to human being. And, and it was the inhumanity of the psychiatric system that brought so many people into it, to try to change it. 

00:36:10
FRANK WILLS And, and one of the things I think you've done in your work is, is highlight the inadequacy of the bio… 

00:36:15
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:36:15
FRANK WILLS …and medical model, but in return you've been accused of being cantankerous. 

00:36:25
DOROTHY ROWE Oh, yeah. 

00:36:25
FRANK WILLS I think, yes. I somehow feel that you, you rather with elements(ph) of pride by that what you say? 

00:36:25
DOROTHY ROWE Well, it was uh… um… I think it was because I was like colonial, an Australian, you know, but what things that I wouldn't regard as cantankerous at all, you know just, just what Australia would say and was regarded by many people, its not sufficiently polite. 

00:36:50
FRANK WILLS And I… I was referring to you earlier about the, an interview which I seen you give a few years back and, and you were saying that along with this criticism you know of you, I mean I… it sounded like it might occasionally be a somewhat banter… banter like… 

00:37:10
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:37:10
FRANK WILLS …its whether, it wasn't all heavy but was um… some the idea that you were fostering the idea that people other than psychiatrists might help depressed people and worst of all, you said that they might be able to help themselves. 

00:37:25
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:37:25
FRANK WILLS So, this kind of takes us into the area of self help… 

00:37:25
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:37:30
FRANK WILLS …and you know your well-known series of books in that area and I… I think I'm right in saying that uh… the um… the first book um… the Experience of Depression wasn't quite a self help book at that stage, but you know did a version of it um… 

00:37:45
DOROTHY ROWE Well, what… what happened was… 

00:37:45
FRANK WILLS …that, that became so. 

00:37:50
DOROTHY ROWE I would… when I… I got with Ph.D. and moved directly over to Lincolnshire to sort this department, the… I… I was given a, a… nice little research grant and all I did with that was buy some recording equipment and, and, and have a part time typist secretary, who I've to record my discussions with the clients and, and, and my secretary would type them up for me and then I could go over them just have a written account of what we were saying and until I had actually written down there, the persons ideas they constructs. And then I felt like to(ph) have done some kind of report on this after all I had been given a grant and I realized I couldn't put it into an academic paper and I would had academic papers published in the British journal of psychiatry, but I knew I… I just had too much material. So I wrote a book and I would never do this that this way around, I wrote the whole book, and then wondered how I could get it published and Don Bannister was enormously helpful in this because he was a, an advisor to the psychology, editor of John Wiley. And, and so my first book was then called the Experience of Depression, now its called Choosing Not Losing, that it was published in 78. By then, I had realized that I was spending a lot of time talking with people about the subject that Erin Beck later forbad to his disciples to you to talk about. I was talking about the nature of death and the purpose of life and how we end and so it was really those, the philosophical and religious ideas that people held and it was pretty obvious that people who got depressed, whatever religion or philosophy, they… they adhere to. It was one that was pretty depressing in the sense that, it made them to feel despairing and made them feel bad. So, if they believed in god, it wasn't just I believe in god, it was a belief that god was up there watching them and punishing them for everything that they did and they deserve that punishment, whereas people they didn't got, get depressed. If they had to believe in god well, you know he was your best friend, he watched over you, he was a really nice plank(ph). So, two very different gods, um… this is many different religions as there are people to hold them. So that was what my second book was about, which I called the Construction of Life and Death about which HarperCollins when they took it over called The Courage to Live, they're like something upbeat. And then one day, I was um… I was asked to give a public lecture, by this time Lincolnshire had yoga teachers and a health food shop, you know this was a big change in the 70s (inaudible ) in Lincolnshire. And, and there was a group of people who were interested in what we now call alternative medicine and they asked me to give a public lecture on depression, which I did. And the next day I went into the health food shop where the manager Mr. Heath said to me, "that lecture you gave last night is that, is that in a book or something." And I said, oh no, it is my true notes and gave as a talk. And so, what would else gone in for and walked up straight and it suddenly struck me that my notes were actually the structure of a book, so I started writing that and um… David Godwin was the psychology editor Routledge then and I talked to him about it and, and he took that book and I… whenever I see him at book launch, I remind him, that how, what an important part he has played in mental health. 

00:42:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:20
DOROTHY ROWE And he's a well-known agent now. And, but that book is now in its third edition. 

00:42:30
FRANK WILLS Is that? Which one was that? 

00:42:30
DOROTHY ROWE That's Depression - The Way Out of Your Prison. 

00:42:30
FRANK WILLS Prison, yeah. 

00:42:30
DOROTHY ROWE So that… 

00:42:30
FRANK WILLS Third powerful image… 

00:42:35
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:42:35
FRANK WILLS You are out of the prison the way you're talking through it and how you got in there, what keeps you there, how you get out? 

00:42:40
DOROTHY ROWE And that's not an idle metaphor, the difference between being depressed and being unhappy is that when you're depressed, you… you experience yourself in a prison, you… walls are invisible, but they're impenetrable and depress, aged-depressed person describes the prison in their own individual way, but its not a stimuli, depressed people don't say I feel as if, I'm at the bottom of a pit. They say, I am at the bottom of a pit and that's the essence of the experience of depression. So that's what that book is about. 

00:43:20
FRANK WILLS And obviously that was the first of quite a few different books that you did, I mean have you had any feedback from your readers about… 

00:43:30
DOROTHY ROWE Oh, I got that… 

00:43:30
FRANK WILLS …how they use the book and so forth… 

00:43:30
DOROTHY ROWE I got that. 

00:43:30
FRANK WILLS …and having your mind a self help work and… 

00:43:35
DOROTHY ROWE Well, I… I don’t write books that say, if you do this, you're gonna be happy. And I remember one women in the States she had done a workshop somewhere there and she said that, you know your philosophy of life is, "life's a bitch and then you die." And that, I think this life's not entirely bitch I think life is pretty wonderful. But I'm not telling people that you just have to change a few things and you live happily ever after, I'm telling them that… that with, the human condition as such that where we have… we face all kinds of dilemmas that we can't solve, we just have to try and live with them. And that we should be aware of the way we live and think about that, and, and value ourselves, but nobody else does value you so. 

00:44:40
FRANK WILLS So, so… in a sense as to it is a deeper approach to self help than, than many books you might pick up of it. 

00:44:50
DOROTHY ROWE Well, certainly the people who tell me about reading the book, say uh… the people who, who made the effort of thinking about it, but these are necessarily well educated people. In fact, a lot of educated people find it very difficult to understand the basic principles of physiology, its that the way they see the world is different from the way everybody else sees it. But a lot of people have said to me over the years that, that particular book and the following book called 'Beyond Fear' have changed their lives and I was enquired nervously for the better I hope. And, and I wrote… I'll never forget one day, a beautiful young man who was wearing one of those little skull caps that Jewish lads' wear and he said… he had, he looked so happy and he said to me, last year I decided to kill myself, then I read what you said about suicide and I decided not to, and I was, I was, I was very pleased about that. 

00:46:00
FRANK WILLS Uh, I was interested in what you are saying that too because um… uh, as I was telling you, I've been obviously looking at some of your books intensively over the last few days when I just prepared to talk to you. And there were parts of it where um… I… I almost felt that um… I was looking in on the dialogue between you and somebody else because I wasn't depressed, it didn't necessarily speak to me. I immediately felt that's how it sounds when I read it actually. 

00:46:35
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. Well… 

00:46:35
FRANK WILLS It was a little bit excluded from, you know… 

00:46:35
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:46:35
FRANK WILLS …this, this conversation that you're having. 

00:46:40
DOROTHY ROWE Well, when um… as any writer will, will say. When you sit down to write a book, you have to know who you're writing it for, if you don't you… your book… you won't know how to write it. And when I wrote Depression - The Way Out of Your Prison, I was writing that for the people, the kind of people who I would see who lived in the big housing estates and who were being told down right lies by the psychiatrist. 

00:47:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:47:15
DOROTHY ROWE And, and I just wanted to set out, look, this is what it is and these are the things that you can do for yourself and, and, and I just set it out very simply, so… so for that the Depression – The Way Out of Your Prison it’s a very specific… 

00:47:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:47:30
DOROTHY ROWE …group of people I had in mind. But with, they are the books like the real media, money and friends and enemies. What I've… I'm writing for a readership of, of the kind of people who I know will read these books, who are concerned with these issues that who don't want to be given a whole lot of theory that doesn't relate to anything real at all. 

00:48:00
FRANK WILLS Again, if I’m just try and hit it, I mean, I… the phrase I'm gonna use sounds a bit negative and I… I don't really intend it to, but it felt a time as though this dialogue that I was kind of like slightly watching. It felt like you were giving the reader, a really good talking to. 

00:48:20
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:48:20
FRANK WILLS Is how I felt it. And I don’t mean uh… that be, you know sort of like telling them of sort of way, but a kind of a really intense engagement with them. 

00:48:30
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:48:30
FRANK WILLS And, it makes a bit more sense to me now when you, when you are implying I think that you were also trying to push some negative ideas about or they might have been told out of the mind. 

00:48:45
DOROTHY ROWE Well, do um… in therapy, one has to start off with a client in a building up a, a trust or relationship there and, and showing through your behavior that you're aware that the other person is suffering intensely. And further down the line, you reach a point where you can actually challenge the person on some of their ideas. And so, the… ah… the books some certainly in those challenging lots of ideas. 

00:49:30
FRANK WILLS Do, do you mind me saying that about… 

00:49:30
DOROTHY ROWE No. 

00:49:30
FRANK WILLS …you know giving them a good talking to… 

00:49:30
DOROTHY ROWE No. I'm… I'm… Yeah. 

00:49:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, you… knowing(ph) that one. 

00:49:35
DOROTHY ROWE I think so. 

00:49:35
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

00:49:35
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:49:40
FRANK WILLS Great. So, I just like to move to you know sort of a concluding section of this as you… you wouldn't mind, and just raise one or two issues that I'm, I've been thinking about. And, and um… the first thing is, if I… you don't mind by just showing a little about my perspective and my experience for a moment. Why this I have intensified about myself when I'm working with someone who's depressed, is that I actually feel quite comfortable and, and I've been to home, I've picked up that many other people don't, so they feel extremely uncomfortable and I therefore had to reflect a little bit about why it is because I seem to be you know abnormal in that respect of feeling comfortable with you know working with depression. And I think its partly because um… my own mother as I was telling to you before was a little bit inclined towards that, and actually, actually she had, had depression not during the time you know when… when I was with her, but um… she lost two children in fact, you know between my sister and me. And one of the things that I feel about that is that, just in my own childish way, I was a, able sometimes to be with her and to lift her mood a bit, of course, I was very special as well as a replacement child, but… 

00:51:00
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:51:00
FRANK WILLS …so I wondered if you know what you might think of that, that perspective? 

00:51:05
DOROTHY ROWE Over the years I've given what must be hundreds of workshops on depression and often I've started off by asking the group, how do you feel when you're with someone who's depressed, and I've given this workshop all sorts of different groups in quite a number of different countries and everybody gives the same kind of answer. People say, they start of feeling sympathetic and wanting to help and then they find that all their attempts that help are suddenly rebuffed and then they find they're very angry with the person, then they feel guilty about being angry with someone that they're trying to help. And then they start to feel helpless and of course, if they're the kind of person who likes to think of themselves as being very competent and helpful, being shown that they're helpless is extremely threatening, very frightening. There are still lots of people who see depression as something you can catch, pick up a mood and then there's a large number of people who live their lives in kind of blinkers, they don’t want to look too closely at their life because, if they do, they feel they'll become depressed. So they go along telling themselves that they really love people(ph), lovely family and happy marriage and a nice job and, and everything is wonderful, and really that isn't what they think, but they dare and met themselves know that that's what they feel. And of course, along comes the depressed person and what does the depressed person do, tell you out grateful the world he is in and now everything will turn out badly. Well, world is a dreadful place and things do turn out badly and people live terrible lives and so, so many… this is why people are frightened of being with someone who’s depressed. The… the, they people really know that depression isn’t a physical illness, they don’t react to it; in that way, but depressed people represent a danger. Well, if you had a good experience with your mother then and obviously being a counselor, you’ve given a lot of thought to yourself, sort out your own weaknesses or what you might call a weakness or a vulnerability and, and understand yourself then, then and come to terms with those parts of your life that you never got, you know you’re never going to be the greatest, most wonderful, most famous person the universe has ever seen. 

00:54:05
FRANK WILLS I want to. 

00:54:05
DOROTHY ROWE Now, well that’s one of my tough messages, you see. Um… so that the, a depressed person doesn't represent a threat to you. 

00:54:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm… But I was interested whether you felt at all like that, whether you felt… 

00:54:20
DOROTHY ROWE Oh, no if it's about my mother, you could survive anyone. 

00:54:25
FRANK WILLS I mean you know with, with actual depressed clients, would you, would you feel? 

00:54:30
DOROTHY ROWE No, I don’t feel threatened. The… 

00:54:30
FRANK WILLS Would you feel comfortable as… 

00:54:30
DOROTHY ROWE Don’t know if I was comfortable… 

00:54:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:54:35
DOROTHY ROWE Because they you know… 

00:54:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, but you know, I mean… 

00:54:35
DOROTHY ROWE …they sit there and looking miserable and see them with anger. 

00:54:40
FRANK WILLS But I feel quiet at home with it, in a sense, I suppose… 

00:54:40
DOROTHY ROWE Yes. 

00:54:40
FRANK WILLS …that’s a better way of putting it. 

00:54:45
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:54:45
FRANK WILLS I don’t know whether you feel that. 

00:54:45
DOROTHY ROWE Oh, well, I mean if I meet some… as a client… 

00:54:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:54:50
DOROTHY ROWE …even if I sit with them for two hours, it's two hours, I mean it's totally different if you have to live with someone who is depressed because my mother when she got depressed and she got angry, she was dangerous, certainly to a youngest child, physically dangerous. So, you know it’s a different thing all together having to live with someone who is depressed is, is totally different from being with them. And, and of course, the important thing is with someone who is depressed, as a counselor is it you, you don’t try to make them better because that will not (inaudible ), they won't, they won't get better. You have to… when somebody tries to get you to do something, isn’t your response no, and then you have to feel oh, no, I really must do this, I must be not. Our natural response to somebody trying to influence is, just say no. So, if you’re with someone who is depressed, you start by just accepting they are depressed, that’s where they are. The depression is part of them when you can’t accept them without accepting the depression. 

00:56:00
FRANK WILLS Another thing I wanted to pick up with you, you know you made some criticisms of cognitive therapy, I mean I’m the cognitive therapist, so I think I have to say something about it. Um… I suppose uh… my experience is that I have found that perspective enormously helpful and you know in working with clients of all kinds, particularly with the depressed and anxious clients. And I… I don’t um… quite say it in the limiting way that you, you described. I don’t recall back, um… forbidding certain discussions although, you know he, he may well have done. The… the point that um… touched that… that I do recall is that um… in one of that books back in Emory talk about um… when they’re talking about the relative short-term basis of the model, they talk about you know there maybe some philosophical type of questions, which they'll not amendable to you know short-term therapy and therefore, you know maybe they do discover it that. Um… but personally I don’t… if it, if it is have been it's a… it's a… it's a ban that I personally… 

00:57:20
DOROTHY ROWE You haven’t noted. 

00:57:20
FRANK WILLS …ignore. I ignore, yeah. Um… but I guess though that just take us to the issue of the short-term nature and, and I previous to our… beyond camera you were saying to me some critical points about the notion of short-term therapy. And I suppose that um… I would maybe want to make the point that, that’s um… uh… that the, I mean I think it's important to all, for all rules to be flexible, you know, but I would say that I do stop my work at least with the assumption that if we can’t work in a short-term way that’s what we do and I see that’s as actually less oppressive of, of the clients in a way, I mean it becomes oppressive if they want to do more and I say, no, but happily, I mean the situation where I… I don’t have to say no. 

00:58:20
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:58:20
FRANK WILLS So, I think you know and, and also um… I think one thing that we really struggle with in our profession is that the amounts of pain, mystery is just you know so huge um… we only touch a fraction of it, it seems to me. And so, you know the idea of having um… you know people are gonna have access then I’m the so few of us, okay this should more, there's probably a limit, a natural limit time and it was that could be… 

00:58:50
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:58:50
FRANK WILLS …that got to be some sort of rationing or you know, so that or I would say more, I mean I'm much more a pragmatic person… 

00:59:00
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

00:59:00
FRANK WILLS …I suppose in relation to that. 

00:59:00
DOROTHY ROWE It’s of course, wherever you work as a, as a counselor, you have to adapt what you do to the circumstances you read and you know the room that you’ve got and the, the hours that you’re going to work and the kind of clients and the expectations of the people who refer the clients and so on. Um… and… and of course, your own building up of a relationship is an entirely personal things, you, you have to work that out as you, as you go alone. Um… that there are a number of things that I think we always need to be aware of, that I’ve been told many, many different things about how to do therapy and what’s important and so on. And but this one thing that I was told when I was first training as a school counselor and one of my teachers said, always remember the referring problem is never the real problem. And that for me is an absolute truth. There, the… it’s… it’s just a ticket of entry and one of the person comes in with is it's not going to be the thing, often as just seeing if sitting out there in the car; the good husband who has brought his wife in for you to cure in six sessions and so no. So, sometimes it takes a while and not just for the person to present the real problem, but for us as counselors to wake up that we’re actually being told what the real problem is, but we haven’t tweak that this is what we’re being told because often you know it's a… or by the way as the person goes out the door sort of thing. I… then there is the, if you are able to negotiate different arrangement then that’s really good because quite often what a person needs is a period of sort of intensive discussion and thinking about. And then a go-away kind of a bit tottery that they’ve got some feelings that they’re going to be able to manage, but they might and you know there could be a crisis, there always is a crisis. And what they need is to know that they could pick up a phone and you would be there. And, as often as not, they never pick the phone up, it's just the fact that you’re there and there’s not this waste of desert, this great black hole that they could fall into again. And what’s happening throughout the health service now and um… and you know I found this is in Australia when I go out there, that financial constraints are forcing the therapist and counselor to work for the short block of time with no possible sort of follow up or keeping in touch and that’s just bad practice. It's… it's just we, we really ought to challenge that. 

01:02:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually one of my other interviewees came out with quite a novel solution for that one in the sense that he was saying that um… um… that… his organization had been given a contract based on certain number of sessions and what he managed to agree was that that would be regarded as the average number of sessions. 

01:02:45
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

01:02:45
FRANK WILLS And now, it works(ph) so really well because there's always a few people who you know… 

01:02:50
DOROTHY ROWE There's always people who will drop out. Yeah. 

01:02:50
FRANK WILLS …drop out if wanted to… yeah, so now they are just quiet a neat… 

01:02:55
DOROTHY ROWE That, that's need to because quite often its with, not with all clients, but with some clients. Its… it’s a good thing to say well, you know how about we meet for say three sessions and then we'll stop and see how… we'll, we'll just compare it out and see how we are going. And quite often, as often its not someone will say I want to go on or they'll say… now I think you've gave a me a lot to think about I'll go away and get in touch you if I need. So that kind of openness and negotiation and that allowing that everybody is different is the best way to work. 

01:03:30
FRANK WILLS I do, actually. I'm quite pleased with the balance I… I have in my work because I do have a source of leaning towards shorter term work, partly to trying out to the people how(ph) you know… 

01:03:40
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

01:03:40
FRANK WILLS …that there was little opportunity, but um… and it kind of surprises me that quite a lot of people ask for more and I'm able to say yes, so… 

01:03:50
DOROTHY ROWE Yeah. 

01:03:50
FRANK WILLS …it kind of, kind of sort of works out. 

01:03:55
DOROTHY ROWE Well It will take little more to learn to trust people when you've had the kind of… 

01:03:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:04:00
DOROTHY ROWE …experiences that have taught you not to trust. 

01:04:00
FRANK WILLS Very much certainly. Yeah. Okay. I wonder if we can just move to our final bit of the interview now, if you wouldn't mind. And really two things I'd like you to tell us about here. One is, um… any new work that you're working on. I… I know that your workshop, that you're going to be doing in Newport shortly is about relationships and that sounds very interesting, so I would like to hear a bit about that. And then I'm just interested to for any final reflections you have on where you've got, where we've all got to assist, effort we've got to make things more accessible and more meaningful to clients. Has it actually may lead to any improvements anywhere that you can see? 

01:04:50
DOROTHY ROWE Well, um… I'm always working on a book, but I… I wouldn't say what it is because I'm still in the middle of it. And sometimes books turn out to be very different by the time you finish writing than what you start of doing. Um… and but I do quite a lot of, of journalism, I write regularly for the, that excellent magazine that Mind publishers Open Mind and I write for Saga magazine. So, if you turn 50, when you turn 50 you can start get that. 

01:05:25
FRANK WILLS It's very polite, if you were to even ask the question. 

01:05:30
DOROTHY ROWE And uh… and in Saga magazine, I… I can just a write a thousand words on any kind of psychological topic I like (inaudible ) I don't mention death, because saga people don't die. And the, and that's always a challenge to be able to put in a thousands words or with open mind that's could be 800 words. Some were reasonably well written piece and that actually says something you know I'm not just telling, you the readers what I had for breakfast and what quaint thing my child said, as many columnists tell. But where we've got to… I see over the years that I've been working enormous change in people's expectations and understanding. When I first started talking to journalists, which would be back in about 1976, 77 and they drew me up and asked me about why this or why that, why that person was doing that and I would be giving an answer that related back to that persons childhood and the journalists would say to me, "but Dorothy surely, surely you're not saying that what happens to us in childhood, affects us in adult life?" And so, I would have to give the journalist a short talk on that, but no journalist would ever say that to me now, its generally accepted that our childhood, we don't leave our childhood behind and that's a big step forward. Um… and so there is that kind of concern uh… the need to understand but however, the forces of reaction are always with us, you know they, so we always have to keep fighting the battle that we are just human beings, we ought to treat one another as fellow human beings and life is tough. 

01:07:45
FRANK WILLS That sounds like your really good notes to end on. Dorothy, thank you very much for coming today and talking to us. It's been fascinating for me and I'm sure you'll be equally fascinated for people who would sustain. Thank you very much. 

01:07:55
DOROTHY ROWE Thank you.

The school of health and social sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice, we give critiques for the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples, in an informative, but light-hearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series, in common with all the materials has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you are a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we'll have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we've got to offer.
