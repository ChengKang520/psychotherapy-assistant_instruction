Creating Consciousness: Continuing Milton Erickson's Legacy of Research on Rehabilitation & Healing Kathryn Rossi, Ph.D. 

00:00:15
KATHRYN ROSSI, PH.D. Thanks Jeff. He gets . . . He gives the greatest introductions. So I am Kathryn Rossi and uh, you and um, and I, and Ernest, and Jeff, um . . . This way . . . 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN Yep. 

00:00:30
KATHRYN ROSSI, PH.D. . . . is even better? 

00:00:30
CROWD Yeah. (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:00:32
KATHRYN ROSSI, PH.D. (crosstalk)Oh that's why you were . . . I thought you were waving; I thought you were happy. Okay. I catch on sooner or later. Um, uh, we here at the table . . . There's quite a few people in the audience that are actually on our psychosocial genomics team. There's people from, uh, France and um, uh, and India and um, Austria and Australia and um, all kinds of places that are very specifically on our psychosocial genomics team but there's a few more people that I'd like to acknowledge and that's the rest of you cuz what we're trying to do here is we're trying to bring the field of therapeutic hypnosis, specifically, and psychotherapy, in general, into the modern age and bringing it down to the molecular genomic level and I'm here to tell you we got some exciting research to talk to you about tonight and this is not the future; this is now; this is happening right now, and if we can harness this and if we can move forward there is so many things that we can do. We can, we can actually prove that what we do makes a difference instead of just anecdotally, and so that's the direction we've been moving in. (ph)Ernie's been moving in it for now about thirty years and um, you know, I (ph)th- guess I only have about twenty-five years uh, a-, along this lines but I plan to continue as is required. You're in key note number two and our educational objectives are to list three evidence-based molecular genomic foundations of therapeutic hypnosis and list three behaviors that facilitate gene expression and brain plasticity. It'll be easy. If you look at this lovely e-mail, which I don't do too much reading but I'm gonna go ahead and read this one to you. This, this was written by Mauro and (ph)Giovanna, who are sitting right here, on December 2nd of this year is the first e-mail really talking about m-, mind gene research, says "Hi Ernest and Kathryn. It's fantastic and revolutionary. We've done the genomic analysis and we've discovered something extraordinary. (ph)Stefanna will send you in the first data but tomorrow we will know more detail. For now I can say to you that we have five genes that up-regulated and forty down-regulated, both of them at one hour and twenty-four hour. All of us has been fantastic, but in particular I want to say you thanks to exist. You are a gift for the humanity. For the first time, we're changing the world," and that's the world we're inviting you into today. Since I mentioned (ph)Stefano I thought you would like to meet him, that uh, you can probably tell that I'm in this picture. I'm the short one; I'm always the short one, and uh, the other woman is (ph)Angela, uh, and there is (ph)Stefano that's the head of the lab that analyzed the, the genomic data, and uh, the other man there is (ph)Salvatori Ianati, and anyone who doesn't know him, you're really missing something grand. Not only is he a great humanitarian but he's been in the forefront of changing things for the good for years and years and years. He was the originator in the United States of the idea of having birth centers because it's much more natural to birth a baby like you're in a house rather than that you're in the hospital and he really pioneered that research and he believes in us so much that he's the one that really got after his Italian colleagues and said, "Let's do this," and without further ado, the man of the hour that we respect and love, Dr. Ernest Rossi. (inaudible ) Is your microphone on? (inaudible )

Ernest Rossi, Ph.D. 

00:04:45
ERNEST ROSSI, PH.D. Okay. Where did all of this come from, this new vision of what we're doing with therapeutic hypnosis? (ph)Is a forgotten MD (ph)that (ph)from 1902 who wrote a book, Practical, uh, uh, Applications of Hypnosis to Practical Medicine, and he's the first person to talk about uh, quote, "the ideal plastic ideal." Uh, how is it possible to cure by ideas and volition and what is suggestibility? He says, "Well, it's the ability to receive an impulse and this ideal plastic facility." What is that supposed to mean? His ideas were completely forgotten for about a hundred years. It wasn't until 1975, the middle 1970s, that neuroscience as we know it first came together, and it wasn't another twenty years 'til 1995 that they did the crucial experiments showing that psychological processes, psychological experiences could turn on brain plasticity, and what did they mean by that? That psychological factors, environmental factors, life style factors, could actually make our brain grow. So this is (ph)thult's main line of the research that we're doing and reporting on today. We're, we're going to be reporting research that we begin our (ph)furl, (ph)puzzles (ph)our (ph)first (ph)report (ph)in, uh, 2008, uh, then in 2010 a more extensive report, and then now, we are doing a larger study to validate our ideas. So let's get the overall pack-, picture. I have a circular diagram here. Many of my diagrams are circular because I'm looking at very broad processes. Obviously, all of us here know what culture and all of are here and know what mind is, and most of us believe that, yes, uh, well Erickson was into culture; look at the international audience we have here this evening. We're very much into (ph)ill culture and of course we're into minds. Hypnosis, hypnotherapy has to do with using cognitive behavioral processes to actually facilitate rehabilitation and healing. So we're all experts in culture and mind. That's what we studied; that's what we do: we talk to people. What we've (ph)been learning in our generation through neuroscience is a profound connection between mind and RNA. Do you know what that is? Do you know how th-, the m-, (ph)orinay then communicates and turns our genes? And then our genes make the proteins that stimulate stem cells in our brain to create new neural networks, and that creates new consciousness. That's why this whole workshop's called Creating Conscious. It happe- . . . This is the way it happens. Each time you go around a cycle you cultivate new and hopefully better levels of consciousness. So look at this thoughtfully for a moment. We are experts in culture and mind but for the most part we're blind to the substructure and that's what we're going to present tonight. Our research . . . I first talked about this in 2002 in my book, uh, Gene Expression: The Psycho-biology of Gene Expression and they say, you know, in science circles it takes about ten years for an idea to catch on. Well I was naive back in 2002. I thought everybody was gonna read this book, the Psycho-biology of Gene Expression. It's a new foundation of consciousness; a new foundation of psychotherapy and, (ph)above (ph)all, for therapeutic hypnosis. Whew; the book dropped like a never- was-born. A psych . . . Uh, kinda like psychobiology of gene expression was foreign to our profession and th-, this biologist . . . They understood it but for them it was too elementary. Well it's taken ten years to assemble the team represented by Mauro and (ph)Giovanna. So I'm gonna present about half-a-dozen slides talking about these three steps connecting culture and mind with RNA, genes, and brain growth. That is really the object of all of our work or, we believe. Creating new levels of consciousness and actual new brain tissue. Okay. I have here two lovable zebra finches. Aren't they sweet? It's the male who's got these, these (ph)little zebra spices and he's off giving this female . . . The females are very light and not colorful at all, and he's giving her a line, you know? You know what it's about, and you know, she's (ph)a (ph)hurt . . . Look at the body language. She's pulling away but she's firmly gripped there. "What's this guy telling me? What kind of a land line is he dropping on me?," you know? And Darwin actually observed finches, different varieties of finches, and based his evolutionary theory, in part, on their behavior, but now the big discovery of neuroscience is that microRNA, emergent RNAs respond to thought. (ph)Member? That's it. It's this figure down here. What is that supposed to mean? It turns out that the females don't sing elaborate songs, that only the male sings, and the male learns his song from his father. So the father says, "tweet, tweet, tweet," and the little guy says, "Tweet. Oh! Tweet, tweet, tweet." Uh, he makes a little mistake. "Oh." He (ph)gets . . . He's tries to imitate his father, but try as he might . . . Evolution works this way: nobody's perfect, you know? So he makes a little make mistake. Well, does he go get depressed over his mistake and so forth? No. He gets shouting out and before you know it, he gets to be known as Tweet, tweet, oh, tweet. In other words, his error . . . And you know what Darwin says. "Evolution proceeds by random variations and selections." The random processes are essentially errors but then we select the, select certain ones that help improve our adaptation. So this is the first profound point. Errors, so-called, often become a core of our identity. If the lady picks a (ph)shine (ph)to (ph)him and the errors or whatever, she learns to fly to him whenever he's chirping in the trees and . . . So if you take the bird song as the analog of human speech, this is how we can do research with finches that say something about human speech and how human speech . . . You hear something. How does it get inside your head and how does it change your behavior? Well the profound thing they've found is this: what happens to the lady when, you know, you examine her brain and she hears the voice of her, her guy? It goes through different networks of the brain and finally gets to one neuron and to that neuron it sends the surface of the neuron sends an RNA message to the nucleus of the cell and that's where the genes are and it (ph)tran says to the gene, "Turn on. Make your protein. Make your healing." 

00:14:35

00:14:40
ERNEST ROSSI, PH.D. So, one of the authors of this paper said, "This is the first time we found how genes are turned on by a thought." You know about the mind-body problem. You know about the nature- nurture problem. How does something's in, insubstantial as a thought . . . How can it affect flesh? How can it become ideoplastic, as (ph)Wittenstrand said in 1902. How is it possible for thoughts to modify our gene expression, change our brain plasticity to grow our brain or suppress our brain? Stress has the opposite effect on the brain. It actually causes the hippocampus, the part of the brain that starts new learning, it actually cr-, decreases the volume of the hippocampus. So thoughts are related to stress that will reduce our brain. Our thoughts are related to somethings exc-, that's exciting and stimulating and causes our brain to grow. Okay. Now let's come up to the human dimension. This is a four- stage creative process that's actually five panels, but the first two panels on the left represent, uh, a student. The gears are turning in his mind and he starts writing down equations, trying to solve a problem. This is a stimulus and usually, if it's a truly creative problem, he . . . Stage two is the student gets depressed. Smoke comes out of his brain. It's a cartoon after all. It shows that his brain actually heats up. Thoughts are proceeding at a such a rapid rate that energy's being burned and Leonardo da Vinci, you know, centuries ago, he ha-, had seven stages. Today we have four or five depending upon the research. Leonardo da Vinci called this stage (ph)sifumo; he's . . . Person is smoking; heat is actually generated. I will remember when Erickson worked with people. Sometimes they would get so intense in their (ph)inner work that they say, "Oh!" They pull out their clothes. "Oh I'm getting so hot. Is it usually h-, hot when (ph)pee, you hypnotize people doctor?" That is, they really got involved; they were activated, and, if all goes well, stage three is "Ah!" Suddenly, "Aha!" The student gets an idea, a flash of light. He's so surprised he drops his pencil and then stage four he says, "Wow! That's magic! It's clear how wonderfully that all works." I call this the Novelty Numinosum Neurogenesis Effect. I was so proud of myself in 2002 when I invented this beautiful alliteration. (ph)Then (ph)it was reported that gonna re-, report the Novelty Numinosum (ph)gender race that's been invented and this obscure psychotherapist will . . . None of that. This phrase has dropped dead. It's killed my career. But as we go on you'll see how it does make sense in a crazy kind of way. It's saying that novelty, evolution . . . Anything that's novel in your environment . . . Evolution wants, focuses it, your attention, automatically, because that has survival value. If the novel thing is a wolf chasing after you, you don't like it. On the other hand, the novelty might be something good to eat. Anything that's new in the environment is an activity that turns on gene expression and the numinosum, I'll explain it, is the spiritual counterpart of that experience; the motivational counterpart, and that's what turns on neurogenesis: new brain growth. So you see the whole thing fit together so beautifully. Eh, like Einstein said, "It's so beautiful, the equations. It must be right." What, what good is it if nobody knows about it? And that's our problem. Okay here's the same four- stage creative process. One, two, three, four. In this diagram that I have labeled "Darwin's Daily and (ph)Orally Dharma." What do I mean by that? Dharma, you know, it's a term from scra-, Sanskrit, Buddhism. It means "the work," "the activity." Darwin actually said in his first book on uh, evolutionary theory, that evolution is doesn't take place over millions of years. Yes, it takes place over a million years but actually it takes place on a daily and hourly basis. Random changes are taking place in us spontaneously and the environment selects those variations that are either harmful for us and we, our health starts decreasing or they're good for us and health starts increasing so even Darwin recognized that this hour and daily process is a really available to us in psychotherapy. That's the point of this whole diagram. Jeffrey Zeig once asked me years ago, "Ernie, did you ever have an epiphany with Milton Ericks-, Erickson?" Holy smokes! What was he asking me? I hardly recognized what . . . We all know what an epiphany means right, right? Well, I secretly went to the dictionary cuz I know Zeig has a bigger vocabulary than me. He's a kind of a genius with words. And an epiphany is a heightening of consciousness; a celebration of a new creative idea. Did I ever have that experience with Erickson? Well, yes, I did, and it was in the last year of his life. I had asked Milton questions like, "How come you have such long hypnotherapy sessions?" because Milton's sessions always went an hour-and-a-half or two hours compared to the forty-five minutes or twenty minutes or an hour that conventional therapists use and um, he just tried to shrug off my question. "Well, you know, it takes about an hour or two to get something done." He didn't think of clients as uh, like a rental, you know? They come in, they rent a couple hours, cou- . . . One hour and they keep coming and you know, you r-, run, you run halfway to the bank. No, he really wanted to do something, get something done. It came from a farmer (ph)heritage (ph)and everyday you went out into the field, you try to do something in the farm, you came back at the end of the day, you sat on a rocker on a porch and you were tired, you know? But it was a good tired feeling because that tired feeling meant that you had plowed a (ph)upward fifty or five acres and that's what made life work while. well, it was around about the second or third year I was working with Erickson. I'd worked with him the last eight years of his life. (ph)Die . . . In my random reading . . . S- . . . Think of random and think of Darwin just random. No logic to it, science reading. Every week I (ph)ks, get m-, my, my copy of science, my copy of nature and that's my reading. Well I began reading at that time about the work of chronobiologists. (ph)Thas is the biologists that study time and mind-body rhythms and their most prominent rhythm happened every hour-and-a-half or two. Every hour-and-a-half or two we go through a complete cycle of mind learning something, it getting translated through our RNAs, reaches our genome, turns on certain genes, makes the proteins and makes brain plasticity, and healing hormones, neurotransmitters, and so forth. That's a normal cycle. Uh, you know, it occurred to me. "Hour-and-a-half? Does that have anything to do with Milton H. Erickson's work?" So I was just finishing our first book, Hypnotic Realities that time. It was around 1976, and I asked him, uh, have you ever heard of ultradian rhythms, this basic hour-and-a-half activity-rest cycle, and he said, "Uh, no, I had never heard of that," and incident was kind of forgotten. Just before he passed away however, I had been reading more and more about this and I edited, actually, a couple volumes with international authors and what was interesting to me was that they had now traced the source of these rhythms down to the genomic level; that it takes an hour-and-a-half or two for some stimulus to hit us and we process it through our genome. Either it's going to stress, healing, rehabilitation or whatever. So I asked, being a little more, uh, cognizant of all this, I asked that Milton, could this be a connection between why, why you have such success with rehabilitation and psychophysiological problems, because . . . And I showed him a primitive version of this graph. Every hour-and-a-half people just naturally go into healing all the way on down to the genetic level. Had he ever heard of this? No. He had never heard of this, but could this be why he has such success? Because he followed one of these natural rhythms? You know, he had two basic approaches to hypnosis in a very gross kind of a way: either he would use a hand levitation approach; your hand is lifting, lifting, lifting, or he used a eye fixation. If you look at that paper weight and as you look at that paper weight . . . (ph)Da, da, da, da . . . Why did he use these two approaches? In essence, he told me, "Well, when a person is comes in they're relaxed . . . You use the eye fixation because they're already halfway there; they're already relaxed. If, on the other hand, a person walks and they're full of vinegar and excitement, you use hand levitation cuz that channels all the excitement into a direct and focused forum. So Milton, when these rhythms were going up, he was using hand levitation, and when he was the (ph)p-, client was already calm and ready to go into what we call co-, (ph)conje-, conventional relaxed state, he would use the eye fixation relaxation. So it was this point that I think we got this epiphany. I know I experienced . . . Well, my eyes almost got, got a little bit teary. I looked like, at Milton closely and I saw his eyes were getting t-, teary because here, for the first time, you saw a really scientific foundation all the way down to the genetic level of why he had a way of tapping into the genomic level by utilizing . . . Remember Erickson's approach is naturalistic and utilization. He was using a natural process of these mind-body rhythms and he was channeling that, so-to-speak, into a therapeutic response because he, as he said, your hand is raising, raising, raising. He would intermix that with, uh, suggestions for healing and now it gets up to your eye level, he gets in his, uh, (ph)move, uh, well, uh, where your eyes close first, or where your hand touch your forehead first. He would give the client power of choice but always moving in a direction of (ph)poor, uh, therapeutic response. So this is actually a, uh, two-hours scale on the top drawing. The diagram on the bottom is the twenty-four hour cycle. At night when we're asleep, we go through these rhythms. Uh, each peak in the rhythm is when we dream, and that's a fantastic thing, when we dream every hour-and-a-half just like we have a energy level up and down every hour-and-a-half and here comes one of the most profound issues. When you have something interesting going on in your life that particular day, you go to sleep and you dream and, invariably, if it was interesting, it's gonna turn on dream expression. Suppose you have a dull day. Well, yes, you dream at night but gene expression does not turn on. I wonder if you see the significance of this? How does the mind, brain know to turn on its genes and encode, carefully, this new experience? Or, if you had a dull day, you dream (ph)begets (ph)ill automatic mechanism but it doesn't turn on as ex-, expensive physiological expense of gene expression brain plasticity. So we come to a very important question: how do you use hypnosis in psyhotherapy to turn on this mind-gene process even in our dreams? Because these diagrams shows there is a genomic turning on that leads to the proteins turning on and they lead to the physiological changes that (ph)Helen was talking about in our actual overt behavior? What do can we contribute to facilitate this process? Notice we're not talking about suggestibility in the sense of telling the person what to do, trying to control their behavior . . . The popular idea of hypnosis as programming and so forth. No. We're talking about a natural process and facilitating it and that's the essence of Erickson's naturalistic utilization approach. So what are the qualities that turn on this cycle? Here again you see the Novelty Numinosum Neurogenesis Effect. Neuroscience in the middle 1990s said there were three qualities that turn on gene expression and ultimately brain plasticity. One is activity; you put a mice in a cage and you ha-, have them run in a treadmill . . . A lot of activity, and that increases brain growth. When that came out in 1995 the whole scientific world was uh, very skeptical. How could exercise have something to do with brain growth? Yet, just the last is . . . I believe it's the December issue of the uh, Psychologist's Psychology (ph)Mi-, uh, Monitor, the standard publication of the APA. They have a cover story on how exercise can turn on uh, brain growth, and yet so few psychologists are advising exercise to their clients. Maybe we should advise exercise. It's gonna cause brain growth and therefore me-, more mental health. But you know, throughout that whole article they did not say a word about gene expression that mediated the process. It's like the general public, even many professionals, still think of genes the way we thought of it two-hundred years ago. Genes are a little something that influences behavior or a physical trait; blue eyes, green eyes, aggressive, passive. The public's and many professionals still don't know that we have a concept called activity dependent gene expression. This is what my 2002 book's about. Activities turn on genes, so uh, this is a new way of looking at the nature-nurture divide. It's a new way of uh, uh, defining epigenesis, which is a little bit different from the definition that Helen gave us earlier today which is stages of growth. Yes, that's one way of defining epigenesis but the molecular epigenesis means that we're getting signals from the outside, like the bird song, and those signals are turning on genes in a certain way to adapt to the outside signal. Okay. So another quality from neuroscience is novelty and another quality is enrichment. The auto . . . Rudolf Otto a f-, s-, theological scholar in 1923 wrote a book called The Idea of the Holy and he wanted to study what was the common denominator of all the spiritual leaders that started a religious world movement. So people like Christ, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed . . . What did they have? They have any experience that's in common? And they all did. If you look into the literature of each religion it says they had an experience where they talked to God and it was fascinating, mysterious, and it was tremendous and the person looked different and their colleagues said, "What happened to you? You look different. You look inspired. Have you had an epiphany or something?," and Rudolf Otto made up a new word, "numinosum," from Latin roots to summarize this particular state that was a high-bliss spiritual state. In my mind I see these two lists as saying the same thing. Things occupy us, activate us physically or mentally. High stimulation turns on gene expression and that's what I call the Novelty Numinosum Neurogenesis Effect. Okay, so we . . . I have a new - I call, uh, my creative psychosocial genomic healing experience . . . This is, uh, the scale that uh, Mauro and (ph)Giovanna used to induce therapeutic trance and this was the result of our first study published in 2008, just the results, and then another two years later we had to do the bioinformatics to (ph)sulls, tell us what those genes did, and it turns out that those genes turn on stem cell healing . . . I (ph)no wonder if you know what that means. Every tissue our body . . . The brain, the heart, whatever. Whenever there's an injure . . . All these tissues have stem cells. The stem cells are ready to pick up messenger molecules. Hey, messenger molecules that tell the stem cells, "I've had an injury. I'm dying. Please, differentiate and replace me." That is the (ph)sem ce- . . . If it's a heart attack, the stem cell will make a heart cell. If it's a stroke in the brain the stem cell will become a new brain cell. So when I had a stroke ten years ago, and occasionally you hear me stutter a little bit, it's a still a little bit of a hangover of that stroke effect, but I'm not, at least, you know, (inaudible ) like this and hanging . . . A lot of activity I went through for ten years; learning how to play the piano and so forth. That was a numinous act-, uh, exercise, that allowed me to re-engage my brain growth. The other thing we found was the inflammation that cause chronic pain or delayed healing was turned off and another thing we found was oxidative stress was lower. Do you know what oxidative stress is? All of our cells are burning. Oxidation is a burning process isn't it? And we get energy from it but we also burn up our genes and they become slightly dysfunctional and that's the aes-, essence of the aging process. What? You say you're seeing aging spots on my face? Yeah, I'm sorry. None of those creams seem to work on me. Okay, so this is where we are today. However, we only had three subjects in this original study in 2008 because . . . Why only three? Because I think it was twenty or thirty-thousand dollars we had to pay and yes, we paid it. It was uh, a-, actually Dr. (ph)Ionaiti, this psychiatrist in Rome who came up with that money because we didn't believe we . . . I tried many times writing a research grant but who believed then that mind and thoughts could achieve effects such as this? However, now we've done a new study. Twenty-one subjects, and that's what uh, Mauro's gonna talk about. So, without further ado, I'll talk, turn the panel over to him. (inaudible) (inaudible ) 

00:38:25
MAURO COZZOLINO, PH.D. Good evening. It's okay? 

00:38:25
KATHRYN ROSSI, PH.D. I think that (ph)that but say it, say it some more so we can tell (inaudible ) 

00:38:32
Mauro Cozzolino, Ph.D. 

00:38:32
MAURO COZZOLINO, PH.D. Good evening. 

00:38:32
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:38:35
MAURO COZZOLINO, PH.D. Okay 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:38:36
MAURO COZZOLINO, PH.D. Thank you so much for your attention in advance. Uh, I am very happy to be here. Uh, thanks uh, Ernest uh, Rossi and Kathryn Rossi Jeffrey Zeig for this opportunity and um, uh, mm, I represent uh, um, international soci-, psychosocial genomic team and uh, for me, it's an honor to be here because uh, um, um, I will be the first person to show you, uh, I think uh, um, d-, uh, a, um, very important results about uh, uh (ph)wear research. Uh, you can see, uh, the name of uh, our teams. Um, there are many Italian people, yeah? I'm sorry for that but uh, um, uh, in Italy, uh, finally, we are free. We are free from Berlusconi and uh, we are very happy for that. Anyway, I, uh, will show you, uh, our uh, result. Before I um, I will show you, um, my idea about psychosocial and cultural genomics. I think psychosocial and cultural genomics are many things at the same time. Uh, a new epigenetic model of therapy and uh, Rossi, um, showed you, uh, everything about that but at the same time uh, it's an uh, (ph)interdishiplinary research method. In fact, in our, uh, team, we have a medical doctor, b-, uh, molecular biologist, bioinformatic, psychology, psychotherapies, and problem, probably, we, uh, will need uh, uh, statistical expert and uh, um, and physical expert and so . . . Um, it's also an integrate method of mind- body therapy because uh, uh, we don't have only, um, at psychological level but we, uh, work on uh, a genomic level and uh, I think uh, it's uh, uh, an important revolution in our field because uh, one of the reason of uh, um, of our uh, limit, uh, is uh, uh, it's not, mm, it's, mm, not (ph)have (ph)a, uh, important evidence based to uh, demonstrate our job, um, in the best way. Anyway, we have uh, also uh, another uh, thing, um, it's uh, a resolution of complex problems because uh, uh, psychosocial genomic, um, in uh, practice, uh, way, practice level is uh, the (ph)crevative process and I uh, I uh, know that uh, this is uh, a wonderful method to solve the complex problem, the personal and professional problem but at the same time, uh, mm, de-, um, this is uh, a lifestyle. You can see Ernest Rossi and uh, uh, Kathryn, uh, they, um, uh, they are not only uh, the, the master of psychotherapy but uh, uh, for us, ye are an important example of uh, life, uh, and so on. And uh, uh, this kind of lifestyle is uh, uh, uh, the best way to modulate the gene expression in health and uh, uh, for this reason I, uh, decided uh, to, uh, to dedicate my life in uh, in this field. Uh, we have uh, the description of our research and uh, um, in this, uh, research, we have twenty-one subject; eleven men and ten woman. I'm sorry for woman. B- . . . Um, the medium age is forty years old and uh, the, the level of education is uh, uh, I. What is the (ph)epothosis of our, uh, research? DNA micro rays to explore (ph)valleydidit, validity of creative psychosocial genomic (ph)illing experience, assess how creative, positive experience can modulate gene expression. This is our hypothesis and uh, uh, we will try, uh, to um, uh, to have many evidence uh, based uh, uh, in this way. Uh, about the (ph)mythology, uh, we uh use DNA micro ray (ph)datanalysis of the white blood cells. We um, we collect our data before the treatment (ph)imyed, immediately before the treatment, after the treatment about ninety minutes and uh, after twenty-four hours. Um, we use the, this kind uh, of time, uh, because uh, after twenty-four uh, uh, happen many things very important in our brain because uh, uh, um, every uh, important uh, experience uh, uh, that we, uh, live in uh, uh, everyday, uh, uh, uh, uh, (ph)twever, uh, confirm in our brain during uh, uh, our sleep during the night and uh, this is uh, very important to, to have a (ph)die, data, not only after the treatment but also after twenty-four hours. Here we have uh, uh, the results of uh, our analysis. We, uh, use the, the, uh, (ph)streak, uh, scientific method to, uh, to have this results and we have uh, uh, four genes up-regulated after the therapy and the twenty- eight genes down-regulated. Uh, you can see that, uh, by the color and uh, this is uh, an uh, a fantastic results. When I discussed with my colleague by my biologist colleague they, uh, said, "But it's impossible because uh, if uh, we, uh, we have uh, only one gene it's amazing but when you are, when you have uh, thirty-two genes activated after the treatment this is an important uh, results for, not only for uh, for us, but it's very important for uh, our field of study, our field of uh, of work. Uh, this is uh, another kind to view uh, the, the results about the uh, differential uh, ex-, uh, gene expressed. You can see, uh, the up-regulated and down-regulated uh, uh, in uh, the different color. This uh, this is uh, a heat map, and uh, biology heat maps are typically used in molecular biology to represent the level of expression of many genes across a number of comparable samples. After that, we analyze the, the results after twenty-four hours and uh, we discovered forty, I don't know, forty-three, forty-three genes and uh, uh, ninety genes up-regulated and twenty-four genes down-regulated but if you, uh, if you, uh, y-, you can see the difference between uh, after the treatment and after twenty-four hours. We have uh, in the first case uh, uh, especially, uh, genes down-regulated and then we have at the same time gene down-regulated and gene (ph)outregulated. This is uh . . . It, uh, uh, an important thing but uh, we need uh, uh, more analysis and more time to, to understand, uh, the science uh, the, the, them, the meaning uh, of uh, that. But uh, I, I can uh, understand that uh, uh, uh, the Rossi study in the last uh, thirty years are totally confirm, are totally uh, verify, uh, through this study and uh, for me, it's uh, uh, an honor, uh, ha-, uh, um, have uh, uh, this, this opportunity because uh, um, it's, it's a very, very important for me. Okay, this is the same, uh, kind uh, to, to show the, the, um, data but uh, after twenty-four hours. So, after this analysis, we, uh, we decide to understand what is the family genes where this genes in, uh, uh, coming in, um, because uh, many uh, psychological and biological function are not connected uh, with uh, one gene, but we are a complex system and for this reason uh, we have uh, many genes, co-, conflicted uh, to one function and so on. For this reason we, uh, we use the, an important uh, scientific (ph)software. This uh, the uh, the, the name is DAVID. DAVID software is one of the most uh, important software, uh, to understand this, the, the meaning of uh, uh, this results and uh, here we have only, only e-, sam-, example deer about the connection between uh, the gene expressed in our research and the, the function, uh, correlated with this genes and I, uh, decide to show you for, uh, (ph)genometology terms but we have uh, uh, f-, uh, fifteen genometology terms correlated with our genes. I . . . You, uh, in a brief way, this, uh, this slide. In the first ki- . . . In the first case we have uh, a, uh, uh, a family gene, um, modulate the neuron (ph)uptosis. The neuron uptosis is uh, an important function of our brain, of our uh, body, because, um, it's uh, a, a, a, um, um . . .

ERNEST ROSSI, PH.D. Finish. 

00:54:15
MAURO COZZOLINO, PH.D. . . . um, to um . . . 

00:54:20
ERNEST ROSSI, PH.D. (ph)Basta. 

00:54:20
MAURO COZZOLINO, PH.D. (ph)Bust? (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:54:20
ERNEST ROSSI, PH.D. (crosstalk)Boss. 

00:54:20
MAURO COZZOLINO, PH.D. Yeah. Okay. And so on, but, we have uh, we have uh, immune response and (ph)leiko (ph)city activation and (ph)protein (ph)thrust (ph)pote. This uh, (ph)disco (ph)terms, uh, are very important uh, uh, for the future because we need uh, (crosstalk)uh, many times and many study to, uh, understand the, the important uh, meaning of that. Uh, thank you so much for your attention and uh, uh, I'm sorry for my English but uh, for the next time, for the next time I, I will study (inaudible).
