JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hi, my name is John Sommers-Flanagan and I am a professor of Counselor Education at the University of Montana. Uh… I have a number of books out, one of them is called "Tough Kids, Cool Counseling", and of the reasons that I ended up writing that book is because I love working with challenging, so called "challenging youth and young adults." And so the focus of this particular lecture is all about that. It's about how do we do a clinical interview with people who may be are reluctant or "resistant" to being interviewed. So, I want to start with a story, I guess some stories, about my own, umm… entry into becoming a professional counselor, psychotherapist. And umm… when I first started private practice, I wanted to do health psychology. I wanted to help people with high blood pressure, and asthma and other kinds of medical problems, and use psychological procedures to help themselves deal with the medical or physical problem. I didn't get many of those referrals, instead I was the young guy in town and they sent me all the "difficult teenagers" or tough kids. And as it turned out, somewhat surprisingly, I loved it. I really loved working with that population then and I still do. But one thing I discovered, I remember one young man saying to me, I lean forward to try to make a point, you know, and he says to me, "You look really stupid when you lean forward like that." And I remember leaning back and saying, "Thanks for letting me know." I remember another kid who I worked, with who'd consistently go to sleep, just go to sleep, you know, wouldn't matter if it was the first interview or the 10th interview. This kid was… came to counseling to sleep. I guess there is something therapeutic about that. And then I remember, and this has happened a number of times, especially when I started working more with young adults as well, as uh… teenagers, but the entry phrase of, "I just need to let you know, I punched my last counselor." I… I just love it, so wonderful when you have that kind of a beginning. I know you guys are probably thinking, "He's not serious", I am serious. So… and I'll get to that soon. Our class goals are goals for the day, define and understand the challenging client. We want to try to understand who… who is that. Think about clients and ourselves in non-blaming ways. So we don't want to blame clients for being challenging, and we don't want to blame ourselves if our clients are really challenging. Articulate and use eight or more, maybe we'll get more, but we'll get at least eight specific techniques for reducing so called resistance and enhancing collaboration during a clinical interview. Sound good? We're ready. This is one of my favorite topics of all time. Who are these challenging clients? Now we can't even figure out what to name them? We don't have… nobody agrees. Should we call them challenging, should we call them tough, should we call them difficult, should we call them reluctant? Should we call the resistant? That's really the… the classic thing that we say, although back in 1984 or 1982, Steven DeShazer, solution focus guy, buried resistance in his backyard and gave it a funeral and said that we should not speak of it again, because it's not a helpful term. So, the solution focus people came up with this phrase, you know, they always try to say things that are different and, umm… people who are co-operative, they refer to as "customers for change", and people who are maybe resistant, are referred to as "visitors to treatment". And that made me think, well, how would you work with a visitor? I mean, just in general, how would you work with somebody who is a visitor? How would you treat somebody who is visiting your home, right, somebody you don't know. I think some basic guidelines, be welcoming and respectful. Respect is huge, right. Respect is huge. That translates pretty well across cultures. Don't assume any trust or perception of your credibility. I mean, somebody is not going to walk in and trust you immediately. We shouldn't expect that, we shouldn't assume that, that would be a silly thing to think. It would also be silly to think that they're gonna say, "Oh, yes, Kelly, she is the one." I mean, unless they have some great… maybe you got some gossip going around about what a great counselor you are and the person has heard it. But most people are gonna come in and they are not gonna value you anymore than somebody on the street, necessarily, right. We want to use concession, it's kind of a tricky form of, umm… of acceptance. Many, many young people would come in to me when I was in private practice and say, "I am not talking to you and you can't make me." Now the concession response is, "You're absolutely right. There is no way I can make you talk about anything that you don't want to talk about. I can't make you talk about anything, totally up to you." I would usually then pause and say, "Well, what do you want to talk about? What… what would you like to talk about? 'Cause we can talk about anything." And sometimes it's just a posturing, the person had to say, "You can't make me." I had a colleague in town who, uh… who was maybe a little rougher around the edges than I was, and he would say to kids who said this to him, and I know this because the kids would come to me later, 'cause they were scared of him. He was pretty scary, he would say, "Well, uh… actually I can make you talk. And I've got a rack in my back room, and I can put you on the rack and then we'll see if you talk." And, you know, I can see certain teenagers who're thinking that's pretty funny. But there were a number of them who came to see me afterwards and said, "He… He said he's got a rack in his back room, he's gonna…" And I said, "Well I don't have one, you don't have to talk to me. You can if you want to, totally up to you." So we're empowering and conceding to the power to the client. We want to show compassion and empathy to the visitors or to clients, but not too much, 'cause he might be perceived as treating them as if they're pitiful, right. You know, too much empathy for people who are reluctant to be there just is like, especially males, it's like, "No, you know, I don't want to be with this touchy feely weirdo counselor." Uh… So, we want to just do that in a gentle way. We want to avoid overreacting, uh… I had a… a boy one time, 15-year-old, and I've told this story a many times, but, umm… he decided to say FU, "fuck you" to me for 30 straight minutes. That's all he did, end of discussion, looked over his shoulder and said it to me. And I never really overreacted. I mean, I dint think it was about me very much. I thought it was about some other things. I… I might be worth a couple of them, but he was… not 30 minutes worth. Umm… And you got to, so you got to over… you start got to really, kind of, coach yourself into not overreacting to provocative people who you work with in counseling. And you will find many who are very capable of pushing your buttons. A little more about 'Resistance: Theory and Reality'. I mean, it's one of those things you know when you see it, or you feel it. Well, I mean, that's sort of an odd way to say it, but you know if somebody is swearing at you for 30 minutes, you kind of feel that. They tell you, you look really stupid. You kind of feel that. They tell you… tell you that… that there is nothing you can say to be helpful. You kind of have a feel for… the… there is resistance in the room. We also know we can create resistance. And if I were to put my hand out here and, Kelly, if I were to have you put your hand out and you were to push, I… I were to push you, you would want to push back. It's sort of a natural response. And so we know we can create resistance, and if you came in to me and you're talking about, "Oh, man, you had a stressful job, and you just wish." "Oh, man, it's so hard, you got a boss, he's just a jerk." And if I say to you, "Well, have you tried using some positive feedback?" You're gonna think, "What?" Right. Or if I say, "Well, why don't you just quit?" You're gonna, like, that would not be helpful, and it would make you feel resistant to anything I say after that. I got to listen first, I have to respect and accept what you have to say. Now the old psychoanalytic model is blame the patient. You talk too much, you talk too little. You're late, you're early. You're unprepared for counseling, you're over prepared, you have a list. All those are resistance, everything is a resistance. Okay, so that's the old model and the… the new model, the new solution, focus people, they blame the provider. "It's your fault." If somebody is resistant, it's not the client's fault. It's never the client's fault. It's your fault. You know, I think reality falls somewhere in the middle, and the way I would say, umm… it is that the clients themselves are not tough or challenging. And I have reservations about titling a book "Tough Kids, Cool Counseling", because it implies that they are inherently tough. Well, in reality, the situation is tough, right. The situation is challenging. You know, for most of the human population, especially teenagers, it's just not normal to sit and talk with people for 50 minutes in order to get help, right. It's just weird and… so it's an odd thing and you're… they're going to a stranger and they can't instantly feel trust. And so it's a tough situation, and so I think it's really important for us to have that mindset as we go into this initial clinical interview with someone who might be difficult or tough. This is especially true if the client or the patient is non-voluntary or mandatory. Uh… And there are certain things you can say, certain ways you can phrase thing to help turn the involuntary person into a voluntary person. Now let's get to the techniques. We got eight or more, and the first one, uh… is how do we use opening questions? How do we start a collaborative goal setting process with somebody who maybe as reluctant or ambivalent about being in counseling? So, I might start and I might say to you, "What might help this be, or might make this a helpful visit?" Okay? I want to know what you want and what you think would be helpful. I might say, "What would a great meeting look like to you?" I might say, in a kind of a tricky way, "What would you rather be doing right now?" And if you say, "I'd rather be bowling, I'd rather be doing just about anything than sitting here with you." I might say, "Well, how about we work together as fast as we can? You know, we're supposed to meet for 50 minutes, and maybe we can get out in 45. I don't know, but uh… let's just work as hard as we can, as fast as we can and get to the end. So you can go bowling or do something else rather than be here with me," okay. So umm… other ways that you can open sessions… If I am working with a young person, I often have the parents in the room, I'll say, "I would like us, everybody, to give me three goals that you have for counseling." Now when you have a 12-year-old in the room and you say what are your goals, it just doesn't go very well. So, we have to transform our language, umm… and make it fit. And so I'll say to a 12-year-old, and I'll say in the grou… in the room, let's say it's a 12-year-old and the parents, I'll say, "We all get to have three goals, but we're gonna call them wishes, okay. We all get three wishes and the three wishes, let's organize them. One wish can be about how you wish school was different, one wish can be how you wish home was different, and the third wish is how wish you were different," okay. And so we're gonna start with the youngest person in the room. I do that partly because, umm… if you start with the parents, it really contaminates and produces more resistance. The teenager or the preteen needs to have a chance to speak first. And sometimes they won't, but at least you've given them the chance to speak first, and there is something about that that's respectful. Techniques two, you probably noticed that was an opening technique, but there were a lot of different things that we can do. Just use reflection. Umm… This is back to non-directive clinical interviewing skills. Okay. We want to use those skills, partly because as we know from motivational interviewing and as we know from the trans-theoretical model, uh… that if you jump right in and try to make people change and being directive, "Oh, let me tell you some ways to quit smoking," okay. People are, kind of ambivalent. Sometimes they like doing things that are not particularly healthy. So, we use reflection, we reflect our client's efforts. "Oh, you've been working at this a long time, seems like." You… "It was a big effort for you to even show up here today, and I appreciate you coming." I like to use empathic sarcasm, sort of, like that with teenagers, were I say, "I can tell you're pretty happy to be here." And sometimes they'll say, "No, I am not." I'll say, "That was just sarcasm, sarcasm." You might say, "You've even working on stopping your drinking off and on for a long time." You might say things like, "You're pissed about being here, and would like this session to end as soon as possible." Okay. You might even add to that, umm… "Not only are you pissed, but I don't really blame you, you know. Who would like to come see me? I got to say, this is not something people usually look forward to. And don't leap on the healthy responses. If somebody says, "Oh, yeah, I was… been thinking about how much I… I really need to quit drinking," or "how much I need to start getting an exercise or whatever." Don't say, "Yeah, yeah," 'cause you'll scare them right back to the other side of that ambivalence. So, techniques two, use reflection, use it a lot. But we can go further than reflection and we can do emotional validation. An emotional validation is when we validate what the person feels. Give it that, kind of, our stamp of approval or universality, or reassurance or acceptance. You want to validate it and say, "I don't blame you for being angry about being here, it seems natural." Many people get angry if they are told by the judge to be here. Okay. A lot of people don't feel happy about being here. "I sure hope that you know I don't expect you to trust me," okay. And I want to validate the distrust that people feel. Of course, it would be unrealistic for me to expect you to be trusting of me, you don't even know me. So saying those things bluntly can be helpful. Technique four, "Radical Acceptance from Marsha Linehan", umm… really the roots are with Carl Rogers as well. But radical acceptance is used in DBT, dialectical behavior therapy, Marsha Linehan is the person who developed it. She's from the University of Washington, fabulous. Umm… The way I translate this into the clinical interview with a so-called difficult person, is I want to accept even the most outrageous client statements. And so if you think about it, what are some outrageous things that clients might say? Think, huh, I've had clients say that, "I will no longer accept the fact that my son is gay, he's no longer welcome in my home." How do you accept that? Find a way, regardless of your position on the issue, because we need to work with the person in the room. Parents tell me… I had one dad tell me once, "I have the right to hit my kid with a wrench if I want to." Well, how do you accept that? Radical acceptance means you say, "Thank you for telling me what you're telling me." "A lot of people have thoughts and feelings like what you're expressing, but they don't necessarily say them, and so I appreciate you're honesty." Now you have to really believe that, you can't say that with any sarcasm, you have to genuinely believe it and say. And the reason you believe it is 'cause you have to have this stuff in the light of day, otherwise you get no chance to working on it, right. And so believe that you want to welcome the most extreme responses. I am… I am reminded of a case, with actually a group, six-hour parenting group on divorce and shared parenting that I was running on a Saturday. I remember it was at the YMCA. We're sitting in a circle. But it's just like an initial interview, because I didn't know the people. I am going around doing names. I remember the guy in the corner, umm… and you know, grim looking guy, we get to him and he says, "My name is blah, blah. I don't need no stupid ass parenting class. The stupid ass judge said I had to come or I wouldn't get visitation with my 12-year-old daughter. I don't want this and I don't need this stupid ass parenting class." Radical acceptance. Now I didn't feel it at the moment, I felt like I wanted to say, "Well… I guess you have to be here ha-ha-ha." Would that be constructive? No, sometimes we have to, sort of, censor some thoughts that we have and I managed to find a good one, and I called it the love reframe, in retrospect was, I said to him, "You know, I really have to say thanks for coming, especially to you, because you must really love your daughter to be here at a class that you think is… is stupid and you don't need. So thank you for coming, thank you for loving your daughter as much as you do." No argument there, kind of, flattened him out a little bit. He didn't really… He wasn't great, but he was not bad during the class. I remember the end of the class, uh… I was trying to be sarcastic and funny, which again I think that I am, but not everybody else does. So I said to him, "I think you ought to, you know, take this certificate home." I signed his certificate, "And, hang it on your wall, your house I guess." He just kind of glares at me, like, whatever. Two weeks later, I am on the phone, he… he is calling me and his voice is crackling and he's saying, "I want to apologize. I want to…" I feel emotional when I tell this story, so pardon that. He says, "I… I am… I am so sorry that I was such a jerk in your class." I said, "That's no big deal. You don't want to be there, it's just fine." He goes, "Well, I want to tell you that I took your advice, I hung up the certificate on the wall in my trailer and, umm… and then my daughter came for an unsupervised visitation and she… she looked at, and she read the certificate and then she turned to me and she gave me a big old hug and said, "Daddy, I am so proud of you." And I have to believe the guy taught me several things with that. Umm… And that is, sometimes the most difficult seeming people have some pretty big hearts in there, and if we can just connect with that, we're gonna do a lot better. Umm… But also, there's no way that could have gone that well without me using radical acceptance. And so I thank Marsha Linehan for that. Concession, I kind of talked about that already, but concession is to concede power to the client. The client who says, umm… "I am not talking, you can't make me", you say, "Of course, you're right, absolutely." The kid who said to me, "I punched my last counselor", I want to concede to him the reality of what that message is. And what I said to him, and I have said to other kids who said that to me afterwards, is I said, "I am so glad that you told me that you punched your last counselor, because I want to tell you that I never want to be the kind of counselor or have that kind of relationship with you, or say things to you that would make you want to punch me. So if I ever say anything that makes you feel like punching me, just tell me and I will stop." I remember the very first time I did it with a kid, he said, "You're the weirdest counselor ever." Which I take as a compliment, because I was conceding the message to him and I was trying to address the underlying message, and the underlying message was, "I've had some pretty crappy counselors," right. So being weird is a good thing. So techniques number six. Genuine feedback, just… just say, "Can I tell you what I am thinking?" People want to know, people want to know what you think of them. I used to teach intrapsych at the… at the University of Portland, and as a part of it, I get to personality chapter and I would say, "By the way, I know a lot about graphology, hand writing analysis, I know about phrenology and I know about palmistry, palm reading, so I need some volunteers." And I would get volunteers. I'd have people go up to the board and, you know, write… I'd say, "Write 'My name is…' and write your name", and I would… I would go up to it with little markers and I'd say, "Oh, wow, look, this one goes up, it goes up. That must mean you are an optimist and sometimes you're so ambitious that you try to do things that is a little out of your reach," okay. And I would just make things up like that, right. Make things up, they are kind of universally, we call them Barnum statements. And I would have people rate me, eight, nine, 10. I'd say things like, "Oh, you're gonna be married three times and have six kids." I mean, I am just make… it's just ridiculous, right. And I would have them rate me eight, nine, 10. I'd get all eight, 9s and 10s. Everybody thought I was just nailing their personality. And we get to the end of the class, they'd have bells there and the bell would ring and I would say, "Wait, wait, before you go, I want to tell you one thing. I don't know anything about graphology, or palmistry or phrenology, I made it all up." But you know what, I still have a line of five students saying, "Will you read my palm?" People want to know, and so just ask. Can I tell you what I am thinking? Can I tell you some impressions I have of you from our time together? Number seven, have clients move out of themselves. They need to move out of themselves sometimes. Being in themselves, sometimes it's a hard thing. What would you do if you were your best friend? What kind of advice would you give you, give yourself? Okay. That's a really nice way to help them move out of directly being who they are. What kind of advice would your friend give you on how to deal with having to be here in counseling with me? Get them to step outside of themselves and to look at it from a different perspective. Number eight, this is kind of complicated. Sometimes, I know this may come as a shock, clients will lie. Sometimes it's obvious, right. I had a guy tell me he had his nine-month-old baby could do judo and speak in complete sentences. And I remember thinking, no, not true. But you know sometimes the kids who or people who are engaged in some criminal activities, right. They will lie to you, sometimes… sometimes clients are delusional. You know they think that there are people out to get them, right. And it's not true. So when these kinds of things happen, make sure you don't take the role of judge, right. You don't have to be the judge, you're not a judge, you're a counselor, you're a psychotherapist, right. You're not a judge. Not your job. You might say things like, "My job is to understand your perspective." "My… I am keeping an open mind." I am just… I even sometimes say to kids or adults, "I get lied to a lot, but I always start out believing, you know, I want to believe you. I don't have a reason not to believe you. Do you think there is a reason I shouldn't believe you?" If people start to ask you about that, you can turn it back on them, but also in a very gentle and cooperative or collaborate way. So, let's do the summary. We have very quickly zipped through eight techniques that you might want to try out with each other or with some new clients that you "suspect" might be so called resistant clients. But we need to remember it's a natural result of the counseling situation. Not your fault, it is not the client's fault. It is a situational thing that is just tough. Instead, what we want to do is we want to be accepting, we want to use some of those excellent techniques that I just went over, and you want to practice those things. We want to use them to connect with clients. We want to use them to concede or to honor their personal power, because one thing that makes people resistant more than anything else is the possibility that I might take away your personal power, that I might be an authoritarian person who undermines your personal authority. So, that's the end of this lecture, and I've been talking and talking and talking, and you guys have been listening and listening and being so respectful. But, I… I sure hope that you have some questions for me about interviewing so called "challenging clients". 

00:25:20
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm, actually I do. As a school counselor, I work with students and a lot of times they come in and say, "You can't talk to me, you're not gonna make me talk." So I just say, "Okay. Hey, what do you think about those Bulls?" So, what do you think about distraction as a technique? 

00:25:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, what do you think about the Bulls? 

00:25:35
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:25:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Well, you know, a lot of time the especially if a teacher has sent somebody down to you, you know, there is this perception that you're somehow the consequence for the discipline. 

00:25:45
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:25:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so you can feel that resistance. I think distraction is fabulous. And distraction is really good for kids, but I think it's really good for adults too. I mean, sometimes what happens is we get locked in and preoccupied with our distress, and so talking about the bulls can just help, unless the bulls lost. 

00:26:10
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:26:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I remember one boy I talked with. I was working with, he had a Utah Jazz hat on and, umm… and I remember I just sort of said, "Oh, you're Utah Jazz fan." You know, and he was so mad at his parents and he says, "Yeah", I said, "I am so sorry". And then… And then we talked about how the Jazz, you know, they started well and then they just break your heart in the end and umm… and… it… he was… he was over it. He was over the anger, the anger was not as intense as it was and so I… I loved that you mentioned that, that could go on the presentation as technique number nine. So next time around, you get to do it, the presentation. 

00:26:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Got you. Sounds good. 

00:26:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Alright, other questions. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:26:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN I am just uh… thinking about you talking about, umm… silence, you know, on the part of the client. Have you ever had a client who just literally wouldn't talk? 

00:27:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, I have. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN And what did you do with that? 

00:27:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, umm… I think because we're all, kind of, natural helpers we just want everybody to talk about what's going on and we want to be helpful. And it's hard to imagine how to be helpful if the person's not talking. Carl Rogers has a fabulous uh… written case called "The Silent Young Man". I recommend that highly. But what I would say, what… what have I done? With younger kids, I've actually written notes, you know. I've just gotten out a pen and a paper, and I'll start writing a note. And of course, their expectation is, is this gonna be some kind of… what am I doing, what am I writing? And it's just a dear… it's a nice dear client note. "I notice that you're quite, I hope you know that's okay. You don't have to talk. Of course, I would love to hear you talk if you feel like it at any point. Sincerely yours, your counselor. Dr. John." Fold it up, hand it over. I remember this one… one little girl in particular who was super cute, she said, she'd shut down completely, and she said, "Can I take this to the bathroom to read it?" It was like that was the right place to go read notes I guess. So, she went and she read it and she came back, and then she writes me a note back, umm… Changing modality, written instead of verbal. Sometimes art, draw… draw a picture, have them draw a picture and use a different modality can be helpful. Sometimes you just use the Carl Rogers, you try to reflect what might be going on from time to time. I know of some people who will use sort of a radical techniques of saying, "Oh, you don't have to talk, but I guess it's a good time for me to get some work done. But when you're ready, I am ready to… to listen." And so they might turn to their desk and do a little bit of work, or… I've never done that. I just… I guess I don't feel like I've ever needed to. I usually can get somebody to talk using my clever Carl Rogers strategies. Of course changing the modality. So… Got time for one more, one more question. 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:29:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, great. 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN How do you deal with the client who behaviors escalates uh… violently, uh… physically or verbally? 

00:29:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had a boy one time tell me, "You know what? I can… I can use this pencil to kill you. I could… I could wreck this office. And I can do this and I can do that." And he said… that he would, and then he sat down and said, "I don't want to." Umm… I had a friend who was at gun point for 30 minutes, umm… 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN Umm… Wow. 

00:29:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Client with dissociative identity disorder who held him in gun point and he went home sick after that. Umm… You know, it depends, right. I mean, you've got a lethal weapon in front of you. umm… you basically just try your best to communicate and to try to find a part of that person that's not violent, part of the person who wants to get out of the room without having made a violent act. We call that sometimes neuro-association, where I say I want to talk to the part of you that maybe isn't feeling so angry. Umm… I know there is a lot of anger here, but maybe we can talk to the other part. Sometimes you have to set a limit, you know, with parents or other people who just start to yell at you and blame you for things verbally. I think we have to say, "You know, umm… I… I really want to listen to you, but right now your voice is so loud and your tone is so threatening that I need to stop the session. Umm… But I want you to know I sincerely believe this too. I'd be happy to have you come back in another time, when you're calmer and we can talk and listen together." Uh… So, I think it depends on the situation, but you bring up something again that can be a whole class on how to cope with and deal with violent clients or patients. Umm… I am gonna stop there. I want to thank you guys so much for listening and for your time today, and I hope you have a fabulous time and success with so called "difficult clients".
