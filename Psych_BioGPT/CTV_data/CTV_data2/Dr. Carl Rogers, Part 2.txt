NOTABLE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONALITY Film No. 35 DR. CARL R. ROGERS The Center for the Studies of the Person La Jolla, California TTHE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM STUDENT UNREST ISSUES IN CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOLOGY REACTIONS TO OWN CONTRIBUTIONS Interviewed in La Jolla, California September 1970 by DR. RICHARD I. EVANS Professor of Psychology University of Houston 

00:00:40
NARRATOR Doctor Carl R. Rogers is noted for his significant contribution to psychological treatment described as non-directive or client-centered psychotherapy. From his keen clinical observations, he developed the baseline for personality research and a theory of personality which focuses on itself and experience. Dr. Rogers classic debates with B. F. Skinner led to a fascinating study in conference between the experience oriented view of man which he have held versus the behavior oriented view Dr. Skinner. After receiving his PhD in Psychology from Colombia University in 1931, he has held post that the Rochester Guidance Center, Ohio State University, the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin. He has presently a resident fellow at the center for the studies of a person in La Jolla, California. His current interest range from our continuing interest in personality theory and psychotherapy to the encounter group movement, and our formal educational system. He is the author of a number of widely discussed books including the now classic Counseling of Psychotherapy and most recently Freedom to Learn and Carl Rogers on Encounter Groups. Among his many distinctions was the selection to the Presidency of the American Psychological Association. It was for us a genuine pleasure to complete this one of two filmed dialogues of Dr. Rogers in a study of his home in La Jolla, California. 

00:02:15
 Well, Dr. Rogers, ah, to begin our discussion, it seems to me that, ah, one of the most interesting, ah, reflections of your life’s work had been your recent book getting with the education Freedom to Learn. What are some of the deficiencies in the American education system that led you to write book? 

00:02:35
DR CARL ROGERS Well, I don't think I should begin go on there to be (inaudible ) if you can learn at least. I guess I feel that, uhm, conventional education from primary school to graduate school is, uhm, probably the most outdated and incompetent and bureaucratic institution in our culture because of pretty much irrelevant to the interest of students. It's, it's really very disturbing to me, I have, ah, three grandchildren in College and, ah, have talk to them as they went through high school, primary school. Their description of what goes on education today is almost identical about it was 50 years ago when I was in school and, ah, to me that's incredible. There had been such changes in religious institutions and in industry and in every institution you can mention but education clings to the past like a lice. I think that perhaps it's because, ah, unlike almost every other institution education has got no feedback from their consumers. They listen to alumni, they listen to board of education, they listen to board regents and they listen to politics, but they don't-- do not bother to get feedback from their consumers. And consequently I think it's, ah, ah, become quite out of touch with the, with the modern world. 

00:04:20
 What are some of the specific things that you see in our really, you know, elementary grade to primary grades that trouble you? 

00:04:25
DR CARL ROGERS Well, there is even research evidence to show that a child’s spirit of autonomy (inaudible ) decreases as he goes to the, ah, grammar school experience. Ah, he comes out of it less autonomous, less independent, ah, I'm not sure if there's research on this but he also comes of it less curious then, ah, when he entered he's learning to conform to say, yes Ma’am and no Ma’am or yes Sir or no Sir, ah, to teachers and to regurgitate their thoughts upon request. And that, uhm, ah, I think that primary grades have been less, uhm, perhaps less, ah, damage but they're less deficient in some of others because, ah, good many teachers in the primary grade do treat their children like person but not, all I must say, not all. 

00:05:30
 Going into the education system, getting into secondary school or junior high school and high school. 

00:05:35
DR CARL ROGERS I think my deepest criticism of the educational system at that period that also applies to other period is that, ah, it's all based upon a distrust of the student. Don't trust them to follow his own leads guide them, tell them what to do, tell them what they should think, tell them what they should learn, uhm, and, ah, consequently at the very age when they should be developing adult characteristics of choice and decision making and, and, ah, so on, he is, uhm, where you should be trusted in some of those things. Trust them to make mistakes and they learn from these mistakes. He is instead, ah, regimented and, ah, shelved into a curriculum whether it fits him or not. 

00:06:25
 Now, uhm, isn't there a very fine line here, let's just take a very concrete example, ah, there's a great deal of concern today about sex education in school, is that it range with the idea of, ah, whether the family is responsible to (inaudible ) whether teacher, school (inaudible ). Now, uhm, how can you, how can you resolve this problem? 

00:06:50
DR CARL ROGERS Well, let me first draw in another aspect of it. Uhm, even the way that whole issue is voiced, ah, shows the, shows very strongly that it's the concern about what should we teach them? Uhm, no one thinks of asking the, ah, student, "What would you like to learn? What do you need to know about sex? Did you learn enough at home that you're quite satisfied you don't wish anymore? Or would you like other facts and materials?" So we start, we start on a wrong assumption with the, we the superior being, ah, must decide whether it's good for him to learn and I don't go along with that at all. 

00:07:40
 I guess the, ah, the key to a lot of our problems, ah, seems to finally be reflected the attitudes of College students. Do you believe that some of the student unrest in that university is due to the restriction of the freedom to learn that you’re talking about in your book? 

00:07:55
DR CARL ROGERS Yes, there are even more deeply, ah, let me put it this way. If, if the college student found that, ah, his college learning was exciting to learn, was relevant, ah, have meaning for him in his everyday life, ah, he could see a, ah, relationship between what he's learning, what he's doing or going to do, you couldn't hire students to riot. They would be thrill about the, the chance that going out with their learning. And, uhm, I grant that there are many, many other causes of student unrest that has worn many, many things. But, ah, and, and they might get, ah, very rested about those situations. But if their learning was exciting to them as it should be and could be, ah, there really would be very little basis for taking it out on the colleges. They might , you know, try to take it out here on a military establishment or whatever else they're protesting against. But, uhm, I think much of this campus unrest springs in effect. Good college is not a rewarding place for young person to be instead. 

00:09:20
 The suggestion might be that the university should be a place to allow for the growth, developing an individual's personality and at the same time we might argue as you say that they think we teach the student should be more relevant that make more sense to them. This is the point in which we might all become anti-intellectual if we, if we try to relate everything there is to growth of the student personality or everything relevant to his immediately adjustment in life? 

00:09:40
DR CARL ROGERS Yes, this gets back to, ah, my own conception of, of significant learning that it is something that take place, ah, with the whole person. I think that the reason you are seeing a certain amount of anti-intellectualism is that, uhm, for so long it is been an absolutely, uhm, oh, part of the 10 commandments that learning has nothing to do with you except from the neck up but it is a completely intellectual, abstract idea and, uhm, I think young people are finally resisting them. I think it was unsound in the first place but it had a place when most of your life was lived outside of education institutions and you're feeling expression in other ways. Now that education is such a dominant force in the life of a young person, I think we've got to educate the whole person. Ah, sure, I hope some of them will get interested in, uhm, uhm, very esoteric subject if, if that what intrigues them and follow that clear through but there ought to be a place to for the, uhm, ah, emotional learning’s for our getting to know oneself better as a, as a feeling person. 

00:11:05
 Ah, of course, there have been ups and downs all about this whole notion of dealing with the whole person. How do you separate the substance of this process from the rhetoric? 

00:11:15
DR CARL ROGERS Again, I would say, ask the young people. They know perfectly well when, ah, they're getting, ah, an education which is far from being an education of the whole person. When their, ah, when their learning is completely abstract and intellectual, guided by someone else, chosen by someone else, they know that. Ah, we don't bother to ask them, we, we, uhm, quite rightly listen skeptically to the educators who say, oh, our whole aim is to educate the whole the person but then if you watch their operations that's not what they're doing at all. And I think the people who know that are the consumers of education, the students. 

00:12:00
 Well, supposing, ah, you're addressing yourself to the President of a, ah, of a, of university and he was going to take what you're saying very seriously and trying to move towards, ah, education the whole person. What are some of the steps he c ould take, ah, to begin moving in this direction to move away from its formal structure for this type of, ah, students kind of structure that you're discussing? 

00:12:25
DR. CARL ROGERS Well, I think the thing we would have to do, attend to first of all, ah, are the attitudes held by the faculty, uhm, because that's where, that's where conventional education is in trench, is in faculty minds and attitudes. And, ah, ah, it is a better choose a new faculty that have a reasonable attitude toward person or else they have better try to, ah, ah, get the faculty and the students to think together, this is the approach we took in our project in the Immaculate Heart College where, ah, ah, we have faculty and students together in encounter groups where the faculty learn how they were perceived by the students and vice-versa. And, ah, or they learn to communicate as people not as a faculty member up here and students down here and it, ah, really change to get many of the faculty very remarkably not all but it change good many of them. 

00:13:30
 Is that realistic to believe that you could go into a, say one of our large State Universities with, ah, perhaps two or 3,000 faculty members and 20 to 25,000 students and really make important role? 

00:13:40
DR CARL ROGERS I'm not too, ah, optimistic in that, ah, I think that theoretically it could be done but, ah, having a great deal of optimism that will be done. Uhm, I think that perhaps the hardest thing that happen and this is the thought that I would, ah, would entertain that all 10 years ago, is that education may move outside of our universities. Uhm, that seem so unthinkable to us today that, ah, ah, as I say I been of entertainment myself a while ago. But when you think of another great institution, a church, uhm, most significant religious experience is moved outside our conventional church the present time, I think. And I believe if the pre-- many people would agree with that. And then in the same way I think that we may still have a great buildings, a great campuses and so on, and that really significant learning will be, ah, what goes on outside of those. I think that the, the number of, ah, college drop outs, ah, for example when I was consulting the Caltech, they became really concerned because of their drop outs, the end of the freshmen year. Who is dropping out? Of course, a few of the poor students were dropping out cuz they don't get many poor wins(ph) there. Ah, but what really trouble the most is that some of the brightest, most creative students were saying I don't want any more of this, I'm leaving. And, ah, it’s that, that I think, ah, is a small, uhm, sign in the wind sort of that, ah, students are saying I'm not going to pick much more of this I'd rather be my learning outside. 

00:15:35
 It has been (inaudible ) seeing here the big-- the beginning of the end of the American university (inaudible ) not. 

00:15:45
DR CARL ROGERS I think that unless the university really wakes up and makes address to change in itself that, ah, they're seeing not necessarily the beginning of the end because I'm sure it will continue just as the churches have continued but the beginning of the end of its major significance in American life that, that could be. That a very, ah, I don't think I've ever said anything quiet that extreme before so if I ever said qualify a little bit but, ah, ah, young people are not going to put up with a rigid institutional cuz it is one thing that is exceedingly clear and most educational institutions are certainly rigid. 

00:16:35
 Now, looking for a moment at this kind of a challenge that the university that you're describing, ah, what would you see its function as being, however, the taking analogy with the church a little further here. What would in fact they're doing then? What would you say that it would cease to attract the more creative and be kind of a technical trainings centers that lose some of its, ah, its, ah, its verb(ph) for the creative and the innovative? 

00:17:05
DR CARL ROGERS Well, you trained to get me to gaze very deeply into a crystal ball and I don't know that of adept that it but, ah, yes I think it might, ah, cease to be the source of really creative thinking in our culture, ah, and sometimes when they're ready, that isn't almost true at the present time. 

00:17:25
 You used to mention your three grandchildren in college. And, ah, if-- supposing you already hear that one of them were actually leaving the university today and for the reason that you mention with this Caltech individuals were, ah, what would you react-- reaction be? 

00:17:40
DR CARL ROGERS That's not hypothetical two of them have dropped out, one is going back to school and (inaudible ) going back to school. Uhm, that I think was a very constructive thing in both institute. They, they dropped out for quite different reasons and it was temporary but, ah, part of it was, ah, they, ah, disillusion with the system. 

00:18:05
 Now, (inaudible ) in his very interesting early work on student unrest confirmed some of the things that you're saying about the so called student protest through defiance. In general they do come from early, ah, ah, progress of family structure and they tend to be in a whole very bright superior students. Progressively, we'll find more and more of these people leading the university and looking for elsewhere to learn. What about the state that they ca-- so-called the establishment or the society in general has an introduction of physicians and, and, ah, lawyers, ah, even though somewhat, ah, you know, more specific profession much less the, ah, the creative arts and writers and so on? 

00:18:50
DR CARL ROGERS And it as soon limit by remarks to physicians extremely I like because I do know a little bit about the training of physicians. Uhm, I think that the, ah, medical schools have perhaps a little more aware than liberal arts colleges, let's say, with some of these problems we're talking about and they're trying very, very hard to revive their curriculum to make it more, ah, student-centered, to give students a participant part in a-- in choosing their curriculum, uhm, so that if-- if they can change we will continue to have physicians and so on. And yet if they, ah, to the extent of medical school host to the good old model, I think they'll find they're losing students. 

00:19:35
 But your own son is a, ah, a Dean of a medical school and, ah, of course, you, uhm, undoubtedly interact with him about this quite a bit and, ah, there are those who would argue that the medical school or some of the professional schools are the, the last ones to catch up with this trends, that is the--they-- they're much more locked in to the tight, rigid curricular. 

00:20:00
DR CARL ROGERS I'm sure I get somewhat bias view that situation but, ah, to my son but I think that, ah, the medical schools that I happen to be close to, the one here and, and John Hopkins(ph)., uhm, I think they really in the forefront of trying to change medical education, so that, ah, I'm not as pessimistic about that as I am for example about the training of psychologist. The, the, ah, medical school set a specific task to do that, ah, it is really terribly important to the faculty as well as the students that, ah, students catch on prior to their training. And, and, ah, really learned to become a good physician and if they're not achieving that then they do get the feedback of no one certain source. 

00:20:50
 Well, moving from that, ah, you already raised a point about the plain psychology and the area of clinical psychology obviously is, ah, undergoing extremely serious re-examination. The, the-- in fact, the the radio talk today about what we call community psychology or calling clinical psychology, polite social psychology. That the idea of training psychologist to administer Rorschach test and engage in face to face psychotherapy, ah, if something of the past that we, we got to look in entirely new dimensions, do you agree that this is a trend? 

00:21:25
DR. CARL ROGERS Yes. I think so. Actually I'd probably be a little surprise to know how relatively remote I am right now from, ah, the training of clinical psychologist. Uhm, but, ah, I think that from my pretty limited vantage point, I see two trends. One is toward a much, ah, broader application of psychological principles and interpersonal relationships to groups, to, ah, community problems to the whole, ah, business. And, uhm, then the other trend is toward, ah, establishing separate professional schools for the training of clinical psychologist. And, ah, that I think probably make sense. I used to be opposed to that saying we should hold academic psychology and clinical psychology together as long as possible because they would, ah, interact fruitfully with each other. Well, I think perhaps if we've done that as long as possible. 

00:22:20
 What are some changes we can make and graduate training? 

00:22:25
DR. CARL ROGERS In a sense I'm afraid I'll have to repeat myself partly. I think, first of all, I was involved with the graduate students in psychology, ah, in a very, uhm, responsible way in helping to devise what should be done. It's always been my opinion that, uhm, if you really what to know a graduate school or a graduate faculty, ask the graduate students. They, they know and, uhm, I think that they could be helpful in, in devising, ah, a better approach to some of these things. Uhm, I think that, uhm, as to the, ah, training of professionals, I'm, I'm (inaudible ) about that as I indicated. I think it's - 

00:23:10
 Right. 

00:23:10
DR. CARL ROGERS - fine if it can be held together. But if not then perhaps the social psychology has expect to work in the community, should have a separate program maybe along with the clinicians. That, that would be another solution. There might be a whole school of applied psychology as well as the, uhm, ah, more academic , ah, school. 

00:23:30
 Should we, ah, be stressing, ah, re-- rigorous training of researchers during this period when we're almost surrounded by chaos? 

00:23:40
DR. CARL ROGERS I think there is much room for a strong emphasis from the applied fields, uhm, and that probably psychology is, ah, too focused at the present time on the training of, ah, of researchers. But, ah, I'd hate to see that go down the drain. I'd rather see a new philosophy of science in psychology that's another, ah, another topic. But, the, uhm, uhm, well, to, to get back to what would I do if I were in charge of a graduate program, I suspect that I would supply a plenty of real applied training along with whatever is, ah, essential to the field and you say, what would be that central field. It may not be unified anymore. We may have grown to a point where, uhm, psychology is a label that covers quite diverse things just like medicine, for example, covers everything from back to urology, to computer science to heart specialists and so on. And, uhm, I don't think we should, ah, struggle too hard to look for a unity, which, which may not, in fact, be there. There are many legitimate interests in the psychological realm, and, ah, I would hope that a good graduate department would have lots of diversity in following those, ah, different fields of knowledge. 

00:25:05
 A moment ago, Dr. Rogers, you alluded to, ah, which seems to me a very, very important aspect of our discussion of the contemporary problems in psychology phases. And that is the need for perhaps developing a new philosophy of science for psychology. And what exactly do you mean by this, ah, a new philosophy of science and psychology? 

00:25:25
DR. CARL ROGERS I think it's quite clear that, ah, psychology is very much tied to the Newtonian concepts of, of science which they borrowed from Physics and that, ah, whole conception is quite out of date in Physics at the present time and I think it's even more inappropriate in the field of, of psychology. Uhm, and I'm not quite certain what the new science should be. Uhm, I don't think it will, ah, do away with the, ah, ah, rigorous empiricism that we've, ah, always known. I think that will remain a part of our science. But for a large areas of psychological knowledge we need a much more human science. Uhm, what form that may take? I'm not quite sure. I think it will be far more phenomenological. Ah, we will stop trying to look entirely at person from the outside and begin to try to understand their own, ah, phenomenal world. And I believe that, ah, people like (inaudible ) and others have shown that they can do good empirical studies, this upon, ah, phenomenal logical data. Ah, so I think that, ah, then, then I think too that we need more stress and naturalistic observation. I have the feeling that, ah, psychology has endeavored to jump so far in the science in order to be comparable with Physics that, ah, it really has, ah, ah, become in many aspect the scientism. I don't believe that we're, ah, ah, tackling the most fundamental problem of the human condition. Instead we study only what we can measure. And, ah, I don't like that I, I feel like that a real scientist, ah, tackles the, ah, problems that are most significant in the area that you are, ah, interested in and that we may have to crawl before we can walk, we may have to give close naturalistic study before we can begin to do, ah, ah, more empirical studies. 

00:27:45
 Now, what are the most, ah, important current challenges to psychology, and this will probably continue to be one from many years to come, is the fact that we are surrounded now by really serious problems like pollution of the air and it's pretty clear that it's not-- these are not the kinds of problems that a, a particular discipline can deal with engineer cannot solve this problem by himself, he-- the chemist cannot solve this problem by himself, the physician interested in the area of public health cannot solve problem by himself. It's clearly one that will require crossing the disciplines. Now, certainly we-- with your discussion earlier in the university is we might of going out and sure to point out what you're implying that not all here, but that is rather rigidly defining himself into little boxes but they are part to department that tend to this. Now is it true how very involve disciplines. Now if that's the government is currently doing. If there 's encouragement for cross disciplinary research addressing himself to this really crucial problem that may in fact, ah, you know, being so crucial that are very survival depend on the solution. What, what-- how do you go about doing this? You know, ah, what can you do to breakdown this variant here? You have, ah, psychologist with a very closely related to you like sociology and they can't really work together most of the time. 

00:29:15
DR. CARL ROGERS I think you've, uhm, mentioned one part of the solution and that is, ah, it's in the application to a particular test to a particular problem that you like you to get real interdisciplinary function. Ah, I know, I know of situations where they've housed the members of different of discipline in the same building and so I'm hoping that somehow they will cross fertilize each other's thinking and that just doesn't happen. It's, uhm, a group, group of individuals from different disciplines, ah, are face to the solution of a specific problem that then they begin to find that, ah, they can begin to communicate with each other, they can begin to tackle the, ah, the problem. Of course, that doesn't, ah, resolve the whole thing, it doesn't take care of the attitudes of some of the people involved and they be very frightened to moving out of their little boxes. But, ah, it would help and I, I do feel that the, ah, task or problem orientation is the thing that will bring scientists together. It will be a great thing if the government would give money, ah, for the time being only for such interdisciplinary projects because I think psychologist have a great deal to learn from contact with the world and contact with other disciplines. 

00:30:40
 Is there a, a possibility that some of these encounter group methods could be actually use towards to taking a group of so called (inaudible ) specialist to get them work together? 

00:30:50
DR CARL ROGERS I think there's no question to what encounter groups or team building groups, ah, which is a variation of an encounter group would be of a great deal of help. There's plenty of evidence in the industry that that works. The, ah, space industry for example has face that same problem, how do you get, ah, people engineers, electronics people and people with very different, uhm, specialization to work together in producing, ah, one very complex, ah, space product and they found that, ah, they're almost forced to use, uhm, an encounter type of method that improves communication and improve interpersonal relationships so that you can get a team that will work together. And I think it is easier to get a group of, ah, people in business to communicating than just to get a group of academic people communicating. But, ah, I don't regard that as a hopeless task. I think if you made a condition of the work I mean that, ah, do you want to join this team, the work conclusion all right then, ah, are you willing to do it, understanding that, ah, several encounter type groups will be involve then you would get the-- you would get results. 

00:32:05
 But the thing that's, that's kind of, ah, tricky here and this goes back to this whole problem of, of encounter groups that we had, ah, got earlier, uhm, there are something here in terms of, ah, of, ah, almost the image that has developed in them and the many academic people for example have read the worst of what can happen. And it almost as if these images are so negative that it, it's almost become now blockage when you really try to get a group of people through some instructor goals. Now what strategy can be use, ah, to overcome this... 

00:32:45
DR CARL ROGERS Two strategies that I think could help. Cuz one of the reasons that academic people specially are, are frightened of encounter group is that they sound personal and they're terribly afraid of being personal with anybody. Uhm, so I would, I would, ah, drop any emphasis on that side of it and, uhm, make it a communication group or a team building group or something like that, uhm, in other words the more it is focus on the task to be done, the more acceptable it is to the, ah, academic person. And then he finds, uhm, well I think of that's the way we get together the executive council of a college that we were-- it was who maybe the task oriented and how could be improve the college and people differ-- discipline where on the executive council. And when we interview then they found out what, what problems they have, some of the problems were definitely personal, so and so is really blocking the development in this college. So we brought up those personal problems as well as the others. But, ah, it was done in the context of dealing with the problem. 

00:33:55
 Recognizing from the first and that, ah, that perhaps they were be, ah, different kinds of blockage that you saw in interdisciplinary program and arguing the only one type of blockage might be some of this more or less settled interpersonal things that some people are concern with... 

00:34:10
DR CARL ROGERS I guess I'd say they, they, uhm, ah, view with things that seem less personal and yet turn out to have a definite personal concomitant. If you and I are supposed to work together on the task and we begin to analyzed where do we are doing very well and working together on it, ah, some of that will be straight factual step, everyone of the other if he is lacking in knowledge we need. But some it will be interpersonal that, ah, some of the things you do get on my nerve and vice-versa. And, ah, certain working out those elements to that the progress will be made. 

00:34:50
 If the people and say (inaudible ) or natural science foundation or for that matter I need the groups that are trying to deal with its global social problem. Would you to say that they should, uhm, ah, definitely start with this premise that they should almost to build the centers of legislation or the directives that implements this interdisciplinary programs, would you consider that important? 

00:35:10
DR CARL ROGERS Yes, I do. The directives are the, the, ah, conditions under which the grant is made. I think it should include, if they were sensible, should include they, they, ah, professionally developed team building effort. 

00:35:25
 Now when you say professionally developed would you say that there-- to see will be, ah, ah, team of consultants that might be available? 

00:35:35
DR CARL ROGERS Yes, I think that is the way to go about it that, ah, and, and I think you're right in suggesting that, ah, at best would be in outside consultant because it's a little hard to serve as a consultant from inside the group. Uhm, it's for some reason easier to take an outside consultant, also easier to criticize them and, ah, and that's help you too. 

00:36:00
 Now we're dealing with the problems of psychology today in, in the States. We talked about training, we talked about interdisciplinary programs, a new philosophy to psychology. But supposing Doctor Rogers that today you are President of American Psychological Association that you were some years ago and you were now sitting down right in your Presidential address. Ah, what would be some of the things that you would address as the American Psychologist today that you think that, ah, uhm, ah, worth hearing but probably a little different address that you gave some years ago with it. 

00:36:35
DR CARL ROGERS Yes it would. That's a real-- really difficult, ah, question because I think we have tradition that the President speaks by his own work and whether I gonna do better now, I'm not sure. Uhm, if I spoke about the problems of the profession, I think I would be really concern that the remoteness of the psychological profession from the lie social issues that ever exist today. Ah, that would be one of my deepest concerns and the other per-- another that comes to mind, I'm (inaudible ) you just off top of my head. 

00:37:15
 Yeah. 

00:37:15
DR CARL ROGERS Ah, the o-- another one would be the whatever you got is the exceedingly sterile graduate training that we give to psychologist. I think that we, ah, we staple a great deal of creative thought in the way we, ah, train them in psychological profession. So, I don't know, I can't give a very adequate answer to that question. 

00:37:40
 Oh, we've pretty two powerful points. Looking back at your, your work and, of course, you're still, still active. But what, what you perceived as perhaps your most important kind of visions? 

00:37:50
DR CARL ROGERS That's, that's not an easy question either. One thing that comes to mind at once that often has amazed me, uhm, is that I seem to have enunciated, ah, principles in our graduate interpersonal relationships that have been useful to, ah, an incredibly wide spectrum of, ah, of different groups. Uhm, that must mean something. It means something to me. They know that, uhm, business executive is a really nice staff, ah, educators at all levels, ah, psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers, priest and ministers, it's fantastic the, the range of impact that my work has had, I mean, I stand in all of that myself and the only thing I can attribute it to is that they seem to feel that I have, ah, voice some, uhm, principles if you will of, of interpersonal relationships of, of the way to, ah, promote growth and development in people in any situation which they found useful in a very wide variety of, ah, of professional groups. Then I suppose one other, ah, ah, contribution that I've made is a very simple one in one way but I think it's had quite wide influence is the fact that, ah, I have been willing to pay attention to the raw data of interpersonal relationships, recorded interviews, all those kinds of things. Uhm, and I think it has given courage to some others to, ah, to stop dealing only an abstraction and really get down to the, ah, basic raw data and then they begin the theories and, and, ah, build from that. And that's, ah, I guess that is something that I take some pride in that I, ah, have always wanted to get close to the raw data, I've not been the person who lives happily in a completely abstract world. And I thought them related to the fact as the, ah, is my-- in my efforts to make objective studies of very subjective phenomenon. When I first came in to the field of psychology that any one could study the thing like empathy or conundrums or anything that's where would it seem utterly ridiculous. Just I have mentioned earlier, ah, I felt it was ridiculous to, ah, try to study it themselves, I don't think it could be done. And then were able to do it, so that, uhm, uhm, that I think is been a contribution that may point a little ways in the direction of, ah, of this new philosophy of science that I hope would emerge. 

00:41:00
 Like any other innovator in your own professional life time you have of course then the object of criticism and you're certainly could not be an aware of some this criticism. What are some of your reactions on this criticism? 

00:41:15
DR CARL ROGERS I'm pretty good at living in let live so that the fact that people of have held different points of view than mine does never troubled me much. When criticism that comes from, ah, an honest view point which diverse quick sharply for mine that's okay with me. I supposed the, uhm, kind of criticism that, ah, I have, ah, list like is the notion that you've been express in many ways, used to be expressed in many ways. Ah, all course of the years that, ah, the clients-center approach with pretty shallow approach it might do for dealing with superficial problems but if really have not much to do if, ah, deeper problems of personality. And that is just not true. And, ah, that, that has bothered me because I don't think that I am superficial and, ah, ah, if the like probably troubled me more than any other criticism may I can think off. Ah, and then of course the-- you can't do anything but left of the fact that a lot of criticism is base in a complete lack of understanding and, ah - 

00:42:30
 Yeah. 

00:42:30
DR CARL ROGERS - what have been doing or what my associates have been doing. 

00:42:30
 Among the really classic confrontation that I think in the ris-- history of psychology then you're debates or discussion with B.F Skinner. Now as you go look back (inaudible ) of change any of this or are there any things you like to add to your reactions to Doctor Skinner's work? 

00:42:50
DR CARL ROGERS Let me first come in the personal aspect that Skinner is one of those who may I would certainly put, ah, in the that I have mention a few minutes ago, someone who, who different point of view. But on my quiet respect because it seems to me his honest about his point of view and, ah, make some attempt to understand my point view this is I make some attempt to understand his point of view, ah, so that I differences have been always sort clean if I may used under the mirror he been able to, ah, differ openly and yet with that a lot of, ah, personal hostility. I supposed if there be anything that I would want to, add to, those to debates, uhm, it would that, ah, this is kind of unfair with Skinner not here do require it would be that I think time is on my side, I'm sure he would feel that the opposite. I think that, ah, there's, ah, an increasing emphasis in our culture not necessarily in psychology but in our culture. And the importance and significance of the person and the, ah, I think that apparent conditioning in Skinner whole line of thought on his work is been a real contribution. But I think that essentially time will sure to be in new contribution and that, ah, we need something that, ah, includes much more of the, of the whole person in the science of psychology. 

00:44:25
 It's kind of interesting that direct (inaudible ) of your views and Skinner's views are in the (inaudible ) of example of behavior modification will be in behavior therapy. Ah, one into the spectrum is, is just growing deliberating - 

00:44:35
DR CARL ROGERS It have the (inaudible ). 

00:44:38
 - the same time we actually to view the ideas in the whole personal growth group that is. Also I think it seems to be that the two things, a one thing at least that this two things have in common their both dealing with the contemporaneous, contemporaneous problem for the individual. Ah, do you think that, ah, we know enough now of each of this movements (inaudible ) hand in individual laymen between cover in book or perhaps through cover to insight that it feel okay now, you two can this. 

00:45:10
DR CARL ROGERS No, I don't think so partly, uhm, I think I'll just speak about what's call my end of it. Uhm, I think that, ah, one reason I say no to your question is that I think the whole, ah, encounter group movement is an experiential type of learning and will never be, ah, fully captured within the covers of any book from other ways. And that, ah, I think the experience is something that might be, ah, pertinent for many, many people but, ah, and, and they can enter that experience is quiet naive individual but I don't believe with level of the, ah, captured in a, in a book. 

00:45:55
 Well what about those that would direct and supervised that consult in the process of developing such group in the same senses those who would apply principles of behavior modification, do you think that we should maintain standards of, ah, minimum training or experience or, or is this the course of all you been a real problem. You know, from the very beginning the psychology were is quiet that everyone feel like analysis, to solve and analyzed and go through regular training. Can we open the door now? Do you think that, ah, we, at all we could almost allow anyone to begin practicing this quote art unquote. 

00:46:30
DR CARL ROGERS No I think that they do need training but I think that the, ah, training they need is not the typical conventional training I think it is more experiential. And, ah, we had a program going for four summers, ah, conducted by some of the staff members of the centered for study of the person. Ah, training individuals to be group facilitators. And they don't mend too much in the way of paper credentials because they haven't found that, that is of much help as more the attitude of the person that counts. And the training may give is both cognitive and experiential. And that I think is the kind of thing that is needed to prepare people to, ah, move into this field. As for setting up, ah, minimum standards and so on, ah, that's a very naughty question but, ah, I think I link further and further away from that, I think that all our attempts to set up minimal standards I have a pardon setting up the, ah, board of examiners in professional psychology. And I'm not really proud of that. I think we've-- it tends to perused a given, ah, state of the art and science and, ah, in a way that is not particularly helpful. It becomes a dead hand of the past to its whole and tend to simply be protect to public. And I feel that, ah, even in the encounter group movement, ah, I know I have no way of, of avoiding the risk that are involved in, in many people going into the field. I can only hope that the, ah, public would begin to discriminate between those that seem to provide healthful experiences in those that, ah, do not. 

00:48:20
 Well in our last few remaining moments Dr. Rogers, ah, I might ask you this, ah, where do you go from here? 

00:48:30
DR CARL ROGERS Well this, ah, I will introduce critical personal note here. I found that I'm not much good at planning my future. I ooze toward my future is one term I like. Because it said you’re like, ah, in to me but it seems up the, ah, this protoplasmic tentacles and then if it has run into something, ah, aversive it draws back but it, it's close in the direction that, ah, seems rewarding. And I feel that's the nature of my professional life. At the moment that my guest would be the perhaps I'm sort of moving toward, ah, ah, writing something that would be primarily for young people there, and if you, ah, there's so little attempt to really communicate the very, ah, the students with other young people that, ah, I would like to be able to do that in a humanistic psychological way and, and try to write something that perhaps that deal with the problems they face in their life as they see them noticed, noticed the adult world that sees him. You know, that's a very amorphous kind of, ah, notion and whether I'll be able to really to bring it off, I don't know. But it seems to, ah, fit my interest with the present time. Beyond that, uhm, I get involved in many smaller projects but, uhm, ah, that perhaps would be the, the only major one that I see coming over the horizon. 

00:50:10
 So Dr. Rogers I certainly want to thank you for being involved in this particular project. You have been just great, it's been a pleasure to know you better through the discussion that I have do appreciate your, your very, very frank responses to often rather tough question. 

00:50:25
DR CARL ROGERS Yes, you've been pretty good of raising tough question that has been-- it has been enjoyable. 

00:50:30
 Thank you.
