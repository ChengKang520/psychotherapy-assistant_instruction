Evidence-Based TREATMENT PLANNING FOR PANIC DISORDER 

00:00:35
NARRATOR It's part of an informative series about empirically informed treatment planning. This program focuses on panic disorder.

Timothy J. Bruce Ph.D. Arthur E. Jongsma Jr. Ph.D. 

00:00:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Hello and welcome. I'm Art Jongsma and joining me is my colleague Dr. Tim Bruce. Today we're going to discuss empirically informed treatment planning for panic disorder. 

00:00:55
Timothy BruceThis program is divided into a number of modules. 

00:00:55
In This Program... 

00:00:55
DSM Criteria for Panic Disorder 

00:00:55
Essential Elements of Treatment Planning 

00:00:55
Brief History of the EST Movement 

00:00:55
Empirically Informing a Treatment Plan 

00:00:55
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:00:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE In it we will describe the DSM Criteria for Panic Disorder, discuss the essential elements of the treatment planning process, provide a brief history of the empirically supported treatment or EST movement, and discuss how to empirically inform a treatment plan with the findings from the EST literature on panic disorder. Finally we'll spend some time discussing common considerations in relapse prevention. 

00:01:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Before we get started one thing should be noted, the purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a treatment plan can be empirically informed. We'll show how to incorporate goals, objectives and treatment interventions that are consistent with those of identified ESTs. You'll also see brief scenarios that demonstrate aspects of the EST interventions described. It's important to note that these scenarios and this program in general are designed to be educational in nature and not intended to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about the ESTs presented, references to their empirical support, clinical training materials and training opportunities are provided in your workbook. So let's get started. 

00:02:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Let's begin by looking at the features of and the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. 

00:02:15
What is Panic Disorder? 

00:02:15
Recurrent, Unexpected Panic Attacks 

00:02:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE The defining feature of this disorder is recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. Recurrent means more than one, unexpected means there's no obvious external provoking stimulus. 

00:02:25
DSM Criteria 

00:02:25
Palpitations, pounding heart, or an accelerated heart rate 

00:02:25
Sweating 

00:02:25
Trembling or shaking 

00:02:25
Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering 

00:02:25
Feelings of choking 

00:02:25
Chest pain or discomfort 

00:02:25
Nausea or abdominal distress 

00:02:25
Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint 

00:02:25
Feelings of unreality (derealization) or of being detached from oneself (depersonalization) 

00:02:25
Fear of losing control, going crazy 

00:02:25
Fear of dying 

00:02:25
Numbness of tingling sensations (parasthesias) 

00:02:25
Chills and hot flushes 

00:02:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE A panic attack is a discreet period of intense fear and discomfort in which four or more of these 13 symptoms develop abruptly and reach peak intensity within 10 minutes. Most of these symptoms reflect sympathetic nervous system symptoms, the system involved in the flight or fight response but some are fears related to the experience. It's important first to rule out that the panic attacks are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance. For example, a medication or a drug of abuse or due to a general medical condition such as hyperthyroidism. 

00:03:00
Attacks Followed by... 

00:03:00
Persistent concern about having additional attacks 

00:03:00
Worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences 

00:03:00
A significant change in behavior reflecting fear of the attacks or their implications 

00:03:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE In addition to recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, the panic disorder sufferer shows one or more of the following features. A persistent concern about having additional attacks called anticipatory anxiety. Worry about the implications of attacks or their consequences, such as having a heart attack or going crazy, or a significant change in behavior reflecting fear of the attacks or their implications. Examples include becoming hyper vigilant to changes in bodily sensations, stopping exercising to avoid experiencing bodily sensations associated with panic or doing just about anything the client feels will provoke panic. 

00:03:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Many individuals who suffer from panic disorder develop agoraphobia and they would receive a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia. 

00:03:50
What is Agoraphobia? 

00:03:50
Fear and/or avoidance of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help may not be available in the event of having a panic attack 

00:03:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Agoraphobia refers to fear and or avoidance of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help might not be available in the event of having a panic attack. 

00:04:00
Trigger Situations 

00:04:00
Places where escape is not readily available 

00:04:00
Places where help is not immediately available 

00:04:00
Places where danger or embarrassment could be a consequence of suffering a panic attack 

00:04:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Common examples of trigger situations for agoraphobic panic include, places where escape is not readily available such as restaurants, theaters, stores, public transportation. Places where help is not immediately available, for example, being far away from home or being without someone who can help and places where danger or embarrassment could be a consequence of suffering a panic attack such as driving or attending social gatherings. These situations are avoided or else endured with great distress or require the presence of a companion. 

00:04:40
Timothy BruceNow that we've reviewed what constitutes panic disorder we'll move onto the process of treatment planning and describe its essential steps. 

00:04:45
Six Steps to a Treatment Plan 

00:04:45
Identify Primary & Secondary Problems 

00:04:45
Describe Behavioral Definitions 

00:04:45
Diagnosis Based on DSM/ICD Criteria 

00:04:45
Specify Long-term Goals 

00:04:45
Create Short-term Objectives 

00:04:45
Select Treatment Interventions 

00:04:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE There are six primary steps in developing a treatment plan. Each is customized to the individual client's unique presentation. These steps are, identify the client's primary and secondary problems, describe behavioral definitions of the problem, that is each problem's behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal symptom manifestations, make a diagnosis based on the DSM or the ICD criteria, specify the long term goals for the treatment process, create short term objectives for the client and select treatment interventions. 

00:05:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. A client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment but as a first step in creating a treatment plan the clinician must determine the most significant problem or problems. This is often done by assessing which problems are most related to current distress disability or both. Usually a primary problem will surface and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few identified problems or treatment will lose its direction. 

00:06:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave or interact will be to some degree unique to them and their situation so each problem that's selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how it's evidenced in your client so as the second step in the treatment planning process the behavioral definition of the problem I specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria like those found in the DSM or the ICD. You should keep these in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. 

00:06:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. The third step in treatment planning, the determination of an appropriate diagnosis, is based on an evaluation of the client's complete clinical presentation. The clinician must note the behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal features causing distress or disability and then compare them to the criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder as described in the DSM or ICD. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnosis per se in formulating their treatment plans but instead prefer to focus on changes on the identified problem behavior, cognition, emotions and the like. Having said that, most third party payers require a diagnosis and most ESTs are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems so it's usually necessary to make a diagnosis. 

00:07:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Step four in developing a treatment plan is to set long term goals for the resolution of the client's primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted in measurable terms but can be broader and indicate a desired general positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. 

00:07:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Writing short term objectives for the client to achieve is step five. In contrast to long term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measurable or observable terms. Clearly stated objectives are helpful to both the therapist and the client in accessing progress. They're also important to quality assurance review agencies, health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objective should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. 

00:08:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Now interventions are the actions of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives. Selecting the appropriate therapist interventions is the sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least one intervention planned for every client objective. If a client doesn't accomplish the objective after the initial interventions been implemented a new intervention should be considered in the plan. 

00:09:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. From what we've just described it may sound like this is a pretty cut and dried process and that you simply just repeat the process with every client but that's really not the case. One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client's unique problems, strengths and needs. Treatment plans should never be boiler plate, even if client's have similar problems. 

00:09:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Good point, Art. The individual's strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, cultural and social network, family circumstances and symptom patterns must be developed when considering any treatment strategy. Clinician's should rely on their own good judgment and select interventions that are appropriate for the distinctive individual with whom their working. 

00:09:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Now that we've discussed the steps involved in treatment planning let's move on to showing how this treatment planning process can be informed by psychotherapy outcome research. 

00:10:00
Brief History of the Movement to Identify ESTs 

00:10:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. We begin by providing a brief overview of the movement to identify empirically supported psychological treatments. 

00:10:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Although it can be argued that the movement to empirically informed psychological treatment began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in earnest in the early 1990's both in Great Britain and the United States. On the forefront of the movement here was Division 12 of the American Psychological Association of the Society of Clinical Psychology. 

00:10:35
Society of Clinical Psychology American Psychological Association, Division 12 

00:10:35
Task Force on Psychological Interventions 

00:10:35
Refers to: the original Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures and the subsequent Task Force on Psychological Interventions 

00:10:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE In 1993 Division 12 organized the Task Force on Psychological Interventions, chaired by Dr. Diane Chambless. It was charged with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature to identify psychological treatments whose efficacy had been demonstrated to clinical research. 

00:10:50
Criteria for Treatment 

00:10:50
Well Established Treatments 

00:10:50
Probably Efficacious Treatments 

00:10:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE The group established criteria for judging the quantity and quality of the research supporting a particular treatment and categorized treatments meeting these criteria is either well established or probably efficacious. More detail on the criteria used for these categories can be found in the workbook. 

00:11:05
Products of EST Reviews 

00:11:05
By 1996, 47 ESTs 

00:11:05
By 1998, 71 ESTs 

00:11:05
By 1999, Division 12 took ownership of list 

00:11:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE By 1996 the group had identified a preliminary group of 47 ESTs. By 1998 the list had grown to 71. In 1999, Division 12 took full ownership of maintaining this growing list. 

00:11:20

ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. They have entitled their initiative as the National Registry of Evidence Programs and Practices. Their work can also be found online. In this series we draw from these literatures to show how clinicians can integrate goals, objectives and treatments interventions consistent with ESTs identified by these groups. 

00:12:30
Introduction to ESTs for Panic Disorder 

00:12:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Empirically informing treatment planning involves integrating those aspects of identified ESTs for the problem into each step of the treatment planning process. For panic disorder, several EST review groups including the original APA Division 12 Nathan Gorman and Kendall and Chambless have identified cognitive and behavioral treatments as therapies meeting the criteria for an EST for panic disorder. 

00:12:55
Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies 

00:12:55
Psychoeducation 

00:12:55
Calming & Coping Strategies 

00:12:55
Cognitive Restructuring 

00:12:55
Exposure 

00:12:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive and behavioral therapies for panic disorder typically use a combination of techniques including psychoeducation, calming and coping strategies, cognitive restructuring and exposure. Let's talk a little bit about those. 

00:13:10
Cognitive Perspective 

00:13:10
Panic attacks are maintained by biased, fearful thoughts and beliefs about the panic attack and its consequences 

00:13:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE From the perspective of cognitive therapy, panic attacks and the fear and avoidance associated with them are maintained by biased, fearful thoughts and beliefs about the panic attack and its consequences. Many of these fearful beliefs center on the adversiveness of experiencing panic symptoms and the possibility that they may lead to some potentially catastrophic medical, psychological or social consequence. 

00:13:35
Cognitive Restructuring 

00:13:35
Cognitive restructuring helps clients identify, challenge and change these appraisals 

00:13:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive restructuring helps clients identify, challenge and change these appraisals. 

00:13:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. So the focus is on challenging the client's negative beliefs about panic and its consequences. 

00:13:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:13:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Let's talk about how the therapist proceeds. 

00:13:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Sure, I mean to dialogue with the client in session, exercises, homework assignments, these kinds of things. Typically focused on helping the client identity fearful thoughts, biases, misinformation and the like. 

00:14:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. So the therapist and the client generate alternatives to these biased thoughts that challenge them. 

00:14:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, yeah. 

00:14:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. The biased and alternative thoughts are treated as hypothesis. 

00:14:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes. 

00:14:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. And these hypotheses are converted into predictions. 

00:14:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Predictions of what would happen. 

00:14:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. And these predictions are tested through exercises called behavioral experiments. 

00:14:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, yeah, behavioral experiments. Most behavioral experiments involve doing something that's feared to see which predictions, either the fearful biased ones or the alternatives best align with what actually occurs. 

00:14:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. And behavioral approaches to treating panic disorder, what have they emphasized? 

00:14:40
Behavioral Perspective 

00:14:40
Panic attacks are maintained by avoidance of bodily sensations and the situations associated with previous panic attacks 

00:14:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well from a behavioral perspective, panic attacks and fear associated with them are maintained by fear and particularly avoidance of bodily sensations, which are feared and external situations associated with the panic attack and so this fear and avoidance is targeted though exposure which asks the client to basically repeatedly experience what they fear, whether it's sensations or situations until the anxiety that's attached to them extinguish. They usually start gradually but some clients will opt to move faster. 

00:15:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. OK, so exposure techniques are focused on extinguishing anxiety by reversing avoidance and gradually enduring the feared stimulus. Whether it's a bodily sensation or an external situation. 

00:15:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, exactly. 

00:15:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. How is this technique implemented? 

00:15:25
Behavioral Techniques 

00:15:25
Interoceptive Exposure (Exposure to feared bodily sensations) 

00:15:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well there's two forms of exposure that have been developed. One targets the feared sensations, the other targets the feared situations so the sensation exposure, also called interoceptive exposure, exposes the client to bodily sensations associated with the panic attacks. 

00:15:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Examples? 

00:15:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Examples include like increasing their heart rate or feeling light headed or feeling mild dizziness. 

00:15:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. They do this by having the clients deliberately induce these physical sensations through selected exercises? 

00:15:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, they do and repeatedly so, you know with the goal of learning to tolerate and manage the feelings without undo fear. The principal goal is that the client gradually learns that although aversive the experience isn't dangerous and it doesn't lead to the catastrophic consequences that he or she fears. 

00:16:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. It sounds like the idea here is to help the client learn that experiencing panic maybe unpleasant... 

00:16:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:16:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. ...but it's not dangerous. 

00:16:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes. 

00:16:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. And it is tolerable. 

00:16:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, exactly and the goal isn't to have them also learn to tolerate panic indefinitely, you know as panics become less feared they become less frequent and they eventually, you know, decrease and go away. 

00:16:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Now exposure to situations is another form of exposure used in ESTs for panic disorder. 

00:16:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:16:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Let's talk a little about that. 

00:16:40
Behavioral Techniques 

00:16:40
Exteroceptive Exposure (Exposure to feared situations) 

00:16:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Sure, you know, situational exposure also sometimes called exteroceptive exposure involves doing feared activities that are associated with panic and... 

00:16:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Examples of that. 

00:16:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, these vary but common ones are like going to places where escape isn't easily available in case of, if you have a panic or doing things that the client sees as potentially dangerous if they have a panic such as like driving in traffic or doing things where the client feels maybe they might be embarrassed, you know if they have a panic it just depends on what the client fears it's tailored to them. 

00:17:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. So here as these situations become less feared by the client and no longer avoided 

00:17:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right. 

00:17:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. panic attacks associated with them become less frequent and they eventually just extinguish? 

00:17:25
Timothy BruceExactly, I mean it's not that, uh, that they just learn to tolerate them, you know. Panic attacks, the symptoms associated with them become less threatening to the client, the client becomes more confident, they become less anticipatorily anxious, less fearful, less avoidant and, uh, ultimately less disabled. 

00:17:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. The exposure technique uses individually tailored fear hierarchies. 

00:17:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes. 

00:17:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. They start with sensations or situations that are only mildly anxiety provoking 

00:17:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right. 

00:17:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. and build up to those that are most feared, right? 

00:17:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Correct. Yep. 

00:17:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Although, behavioral experiments grow out of cognitive therapy 

00:18:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. and exposure from behavioral therapy. 

00:18:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE True, yep. 

00:18:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. It seems that both types of therapy would have clients doing similar things. 

00:18:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes. 

00:18:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Such as experiencing the feared sensation or situation. 

00:18:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. But they do it for different reasons? 

00:18:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, uh, I mean, you're describing now cognitive behavioral therapy, you know most CBT therapists use exposure to sensations and situations although an individual may conceptualize the mechanim(sp) of actions somewhat differently depending on whether they're coming at it behaviorally or cognitively in terms of their model. 

00:18:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Most CBT protocols include initial and ongoing psychoeducation about topics such as panic disorder. 

00:18:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes. 

00:18:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. The CBT model 

00:18:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. and the rationale for CBT treatment approach 

00:18:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. they don't also prescribe reading or do they? 

00:18:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE They do, yeah. They'll, they, they do that kind of self therapy type stuff, homework assignments and things like that. The idea basically is they're trying to help the client, if you will, become their own therapist over time. 

00:18:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. And what about training the client to use relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing exercise to treat panic? Pretty common but it's not always a given is it? 

00:19:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE No, some CBT treatments for panic include relaxation training and training in skills for managing anxiety but some don't. Applied relaxation by itself has showed efficacy with panic disorder and some therapists will use this particular application, ah, but that, it's still typically done, uh, as an adjunct to a larger multi-model, uh, CBT therapy. 

00:19:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. So there's still some controversy whether diaphragmatic breathing exercises which were used in earlier ESTs for panic are actually a necessary component of treatment, some use them, some don't. 

00:19:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, that's correct, uh, you know there's some therapists won don't train calming or coping skills at all or if they do, they, uh, try to ensure that the client doesn't use them to avoid experiencing feared bodily sensations 'cuz the essence here is that they want that, those clients to expose themselves to these sensations and extinguish their fear of them so some do, some don't. 

00:20:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Are all of these techniques, Tim, only used in individual therapy sessions? 

00:20:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE No they can be done in small groups as well, frequently are. Typical length of therapy is, uh, 12 to 16 sessions, typically conducted approximately weekly. There's some prelimary evidence that clients can go faster, that brief intensive therapy's also effective but it's initial evidence. 

00:20:25
Integrating ESTs for Panic Disorder into Treatment Planning 

00:20:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. With this background in mind, let's now look at how cognitive and behavioral treatments for panic disorder can be integrated into the essential steps involved in treatment planning. After settling on panic disorder as a primary presenting problem, we must add to the treatment plan those manifestations of it that the client experiences. 

00:20:45
Behavioral Definitions 

00:20:45
Unexpected, sudden, debilitating panic symptoms that have occurred repeatedly 

00:20:45
Persistent concern about having additional panic attacks 

00:20:45
Worried about the implications of having a panic attack 

00:20:45
A significant change in behavior reflecting fear of panic attacks 

00:20:45
Avoidance of activities or environments due to fear of triggering intense panic symptoms 

00:20:45
A persistence of fear in spite of the recognition that the fear is unreasonable 

00:20:45
Increasingly isolated self due to fear of traveling or leaving a "safe environment" 

00:20:45
Fears and/or avoids environments with large groups of people 

00:20:45
Displays no evidence of agoraphobia 

00:20:45
Others 

00:20:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR . Although there are commonalities of the treatment disorder the treatment plan should be tailored to each individual client's unique expression of it. You may select from the list of behavioral definitions of panic disorder shown here. For example, with this disorder, your client will obviously show unexpected, sudden, debilitating panic symptoms that have occurred repeatedly. Your client may or may not show a significant change in behavior reflecting fear of panic attacks or your client may increasingly isolate himself due to a fear of traveling or leaving a safe environment such as home. 

00:21:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE The next step in treatment planning is to determine long term goals. 

00:21:30
Long-term Goals 

00:21:30
Reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of panic attacks 

00:21:30
Reduce the fear that panic symptoms will recur without the ability to manage them 

00:21:30
Reduce the fear of triggering panic and eliminate avoidance of activities and environments thought to trigger panic 

00:21:30
Increase comfort in freely leaving home and being in a public environment 

00:21:30
Others_____________ 

00:21:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Again, these are generated collaboratively with the client. Examples might include reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of panic attacks or increase comfort in leaving home and being in a public environment. Of course there may be other goals that you want to develop. 

00:21:45
Assessment Phase 

00:21:45
Short-Term Objectives 

00:21:45
1. Describe the history and nature of the panic symptoms, fear, and avoidance. 

00:21:45
Therapeutic Interventions 

00:21:45
1. Assess the client's frequency, intensity, duration, and history of panic symptoms, fear, and avoidance. 

00:21:45
2. Assess the nature of any stimulus, thoughts, or situations that precipitate the client's panic. 

00:21:45
2. Complete psychological tests designed to facilitate the assessment of panic, fear, and avoidance. 

00:21:45
1. Administer a fear survey to further assess the depth and breadth of agoraphoba. 

00:21:45
2. Administer a measure of fear of anxiety symptoms to further assess its depth and breadth. 

00:21:45
3. Keep a daily journal of panic symptoms, including the situations that cause anxious thoughts, feelings, and actions. 

00:21:45
1. Assign the client to keep a daily record of panic symptoms, including a description of sensations or situations that caused anxious feelings, the rating of anxiety, using Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs), and thoughts associated with the anxiety; process the journal material ,help the client uncover the biases in thoughts that fuel anxiety. 

00:21:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR . We now direct our attention to applying empirically supported treatments to the creation of client objectives and therapist interventions. While common to all forms of therapy, the assessment phase of panic disorder treatment typically involved asking the client to describe the history and nature of the panic symptoms, fear surrounding them and any avoidance behavior. The therapist assesses these factors as well as the internal and external stimuli associated with them. Surveys or other objective measures may be used to supplement the clinical interview, exploring, for example, the presence and depth of agoraphobia or fear of bodily sensations. The client may also be asked to keep a journal of panic symptoms and the thoughts, feelings and behavior associated with those symptoms. The clinician attempts to gain full understanding of this client's unique experience with panic. 

00:22:45
Psychoeducation 

00:22:45
Short-Term Objectives 

00:22:45
4. Verbalize an accurate understanding of panic disorder and agoraphobia 

00:22:45
1. Discuss how unexpected panic attacks are "false alarms" of danger, not medically dangerous, not a sign of weakness or craziness, and common, but often lead to unnecessary fear and avoidance. 

00:22:45
2. Assign the client to read psychoeducational chapters of books or treatment manuals on panic disorder and agoraphobia. 

00:22:45
5. Verbalize an understanding of the rationale for treatment of panic disorder. 

00:22:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE As we've mentioned, CBT for panic disorder emphasizes initial and ongoing psychoeducation. In addition to helping facilitate a client's progress in therapy, psychoeducation is also used as a means to reassure, instill hope, motivate and otherwise enhance the therapeutic relationship. Reading assignments or other educational activities may be prescribed to supplement or reinforce educational points made in therapy sessions. A description of what the treatment involves, and the rationale for treatment are also common features in ESTs for panic disorder. 

00:23:20
Calming & Coping Skills 

00:23:20
Short-Term Objectives 

00:23:20
6. Learn and implement calming and coping strategies to reduce overall anxiety and to manage panic symptoms. 

00:23:20
1. Teach the client progressive muscle relaxation as a daily exercise for general relaxation and train him/her in the use of coping strategies (e.g., staying focused on behavioral goals, muscular relaxation, evenly paced diaphragmatic breathing, positive self-talk) to tolerate and manage symptom attacks. 

00:23:20
2. Teach the client to keep focus on external stimuli and behavioral responsibilities during panic rather than being preoccupied with an internal focus on physiological changes and their possible consequences. 

00:23:20
1. Teach the client progressive muscle relaxation as a daily exercise for general relaxation and train him/her in the use of coping strategies (e.g., staying focused on behavioral goals, muscular relaxation, evenly paced diaphragmatic breathing, positive self-talk) to tolerate and manage symptom attacks. 

00:23:20
2. Teach the client to keep focus on external stimuli and behavioral responsibilities during panic rather than being preoccupied with an internal focus on physiological changes and their possible consequences. 

00:23:20
2. Assign the client to read about exposure-based therapy in chapters of books or treatment manuals on panic disorder and agoraphobia. 

00:23:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR . If training and coping and calming skills is going to be used they can be included into the treatment plan using a short term objective such as this one and therapeutic interventions such as these. These statements can be modified to describe more precisely what the therapist intends to do. In these examples, the therapist will teach the client progressive muscle relaxation and breathing exercises to practice as a daily exercise. These will be converted into coping skills for use in managing panic attacks. The client will learn how to shift from an internal focus on panic and its feared catastrophic consequences to an external focus that presumes safety and manageability. As always, reading may be used to supplement these other interventions. 

00:24:15
Calming & Coping Skills 

00:24:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE As we mentioned some ESTs for panic disorder train calming and coping methods while others do not. There is empirical support for the use of applied relaxation in panic disorder. In applied relaxation, clients are taught progressive muscle relaxation toward the goal of accomplishing it very quickly and effectively. This is called rapid relaxation. 

00:24:40
Rapid Relaxation 

00:24:40
Learn to induce relaxation in the presence of panic cues, and then in real-world situations in which panic is likely to occur. 

00:24:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Clients learn to induce relaxation in the presence of panic cues and then in real-world situations in which panic is likely to occur. 

00:24:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR . Let's talk a look at a vignette in which the therapist is guiding the client through a traditional progressive muscle relaxation exercise. 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN Today we're going to practice the muscle relaxation technique you're read about. Are you ready? 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN I guess so but I'm really not sure I can do it. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Well, let's just give it a try. First I want you to get comfortable with both feet on the floor and your hands in your lap. Now close your eyes gently and take a deep breath letting it out slowly. Try to release tension throughout your body as you exhale. Again, take a deep breath, hold it, and now slowly exhale letting all tension flow out of your body. Continue to breathe smoothly and in a deep rhythm letting yourself relax more and more. Now, make a tight fist with both hands, feel the tension pull across the knuckles and into the forearms. Hold it and let it go. Breathe deeply and feel the tension flow out of the muscles in your forearms as you exhale. Now let's repeat that, squeeze your hands into a fist, feel the tension build in the muscles. Hold it and let go. Feel the warmth and relaxation flow to the muscles of the forearm. Know how it feels to be warm and relaxed. Now, let's tense the muscles of the biceps, shoulders and neck by pulling your arms up tight and shrugging the shoulders tight against your neck. Hold it and feel the tension. Let it go and feel the warm rush of relaxation come to those muscles. Breathe deeply and relax. Once again, tense the muscles of the biceps, hold it. Now let's focus on the muscles of the abdomen and the chest. Tense those muscles, hold it, now relax, breathe out. Feel the warmth and relaxation. OK, let's repeat. Next we're gonna tense both legs. Feel the tension and relax, feel the warmth in those muscles. Now let's do that again, let's repeat. Now we're gonna tense the muscles of the face. Purse the lips and squeeze the eyes tight, good, now relax and breathe. Let's do that again, purse the lips. Now you can relax even more by taking in a slow deep breath and holding it while staying relaxed. Now let it go slowly, letting yourself feel even more relaxed and comfortable. Say the word relax quietly to yourself in your mind when you breathe out. Try one more time, breathe in slowly and deeply, holding it and let it go saying relax to yourself in your head. Very good, now slowly open your eyes. How do you feel? 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN That was nice. I am quite relaxed. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN Perfect. Now let's talk about how to do this as a daily exercise. 

00:29:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well I think that was a good demonstration of progressive muscle relaxation, uh. 

00:29:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. I think so too. I'm struck with the fact that it's short 

00:29:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it's short. 

00:29:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. and condensed but when you're actually working with a patient it seems to take much longer. 

00:29:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it, I mean, I think we saw two or three muscle groups through there and so on. You would go though each muscle group in the, in the body they're usually divided into 16 or something like that. 

00:29:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Yeah, right. 

00:29:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE So it's gonna take 20 to 30 minutes but I think it's a good demonstration of the technique of progressive muscle relaxation. The tensing and releasing. 

00:29:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Relaxing. The direction to pay attention to warmth, getting people to pay attention to the difference between tension and relaxation. 

00:29:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Exactly, yeah, yeah (crosstalk) In clinical applications it's clearly gonna take a longer time. 

00:29:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. And you like pauses in the middle there to let people get used to it a little bit, to pay attention to their body. 

00:29:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, yep. So I think that's important to note, that it's different, uh, in that regard. The other thing I think that struck me about it is you're typically going to do this, um, with the, with the client in a physically relaxed posture so you're going to use a recliner or something like that. 

00:30:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Sure. 

00:30:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE I mean if you don't have those resources you might do it like this but 

00:30:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Yep, yep. 

00:30:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE And then when you send them home, you know, you're usually trying to find a place where I think the principal is, you know, where their muscles are completely supported, where they can completely let go because that's the point because they tense and then they absolutely let go. 

00:30:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Yep, I sent them home with a tape that sometimes help them get into the practice of it and it motivates them a little more, they get used to your voice and that sort of thing. 

00:30:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, well you know Benson who developed this procedure and studied it, I mean, he basically said what you want to do is reduce external distractions, you want to reduce internal distractions, have physical support in things and a tape can help reduce internal distractions 'cuz it gives them something to focus on. 

00:31:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Pay attention to. 

00:31:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE If you don't have the tape, you have to find something that they focus on or it's not uncommon that their mind will wander all over the place. 

00:31:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. The goal that she was getting at at the end there was trying to move towards the rapid relaxation thing because you want to be able to use this as a coping skill 

00:31:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:31:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. and so she was tying it to a cue word to try to get them to relax, using that cue word like, relax some people use. 

00:31:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Calm. 

00:31:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Be calm or some other kind of cue word but the end goal that you're really working toward is, can they get relaxed quickly within a few seconds even within five seconds, 10 seconds, versus 30 minutes that's what you're really trying to do. 

00:31:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right, exactly. Typically I think in this procedure, you start with dividing the body into 16 muscle groups and work through each one and that's kind of what was demonstrated. After they get that down you condense it to eight muscle groups so the exercise shortens, then four, it shortens even more and then you get to the whole body, rapid relaxation. And I think, you know, there are some therapists who will teach progressive muscle relaxation training just as an exercise, just to relax. Others then will condense it to rapid relaxation and also use it as a coping strategy. 

00:32:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. And I think they use that deep breathing as a way to induce that relaxation as well as those calming words. 

00:32:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Let's move on. 

00:32:20
Cognitive Restructuring 

00:32:20
Short-Term Objectives 

00:32:20
7. Identify, challenge, and change from biased, fearful self-talk and beliefs to reality-based, positive self-talk and beliefs. 

00:32:20
1. Explore the client's schema and self-talk that mediate their fear response, challenge the biases; assist him/her in replacing the biased fearful messages with self-talk that does not overestimate the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes nor underestimate his/her ability to tolerate and cope with panic symptoms. 

00:32:20
2. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he/she identifies fearful self-talk and creates reality-based alternatives; and test them in a chosen situation; review and reinforce success. Providing corrective feedback toward the goal of improvement. 

00:32:20
3. Assign the client to read about cognitive restricting in books or treatment manuals on panic disorder and agoraphobia. 

00:32:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive restructuring can be integrated into the treatment plan using client objectives such as identify, challenge, and change from biased, fearful self-talk and beliefs to reality-based, positive self-talk and beliefs as well as therapist interventions like these. 

00:32:45
[sil.] 

00:32:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Behavioral experiments or other between session assignments can be captured in a therapist's intervention such as this. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE As always, the use of treatment manuals, books or other educational material may be used to assist in the therapeutic process. 

00:33:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Although therapists have great flexibility in how they conduct cognitive restructuring the conventional steps in the process are these. 

00:33:20
Cognitive Restructuring 

00:33:20
Educate about how cognitive appraisals influence emotional reactions 

00:33:20
Explain rationale for cognitive restructuring; To change perception of threat from biased predictions to alternatives that are more in line with likely outcomes 

00:33:20
Identify distorted self-talk 

00:33:20
Identify biases and generate alternatives that correct for the biases 

00:33:20
Convert the biased and alternatives thoughts into predictions that can be tested through exposures 

00:33:20
Conduct behavioral experiments/exposures 

00:33:20
Review toward the goal of testing fearful predictions against healthy alternatives 

00:33:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Educate the client about how cognitive appraisals influence emotional reactions, explain the rationale for cognitive restructuring; that is to change the perception of threat based on negatively biased predictions to predictions that are more in line with likely outcomes, identify through self monitoring and in session discussion the distorted self-talk, identify biases and generate reality-based alternatives that correct for the biases, convert the biased and alternatives thoughts into predictions that can be tested through exposures, cognitive therapists refer to these as behavioral experiments, assign the behavioral experiments or exposures, review assignments with the goal of testing fearful predictions against healthy alternatives. 

00:34:15
Cognitive Restructuring 

00:34:15
Goal is to change from biased, fear-based appraisals of threat to alternatives that are more in line with likely outcomes 

00:34:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE The over arching goal of cognitive restructuring is to help the client shift from biased, fear-based appraisals of threat to alternatives that are now more in line with likely outcomes. Here's a vignette in which the therapist works with the client to identify self talk associated with panic. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Well what I wrote about here was a panic attack that I had when I was riding in the car with a friend. We were just going along and then suddenly I started to feel that terrible feeling in my chest, the one that means a panic is coming. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Oh, OK. Uh, let's go through that experience very slowly, step by step. You were riding and things were OK and then it started? 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Yes, I was not really thinking about anything, then my chest started getting tight, like someone was standing on it, you know. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN Yes, very tight. Was it hard to breathe? 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Yes, exactly. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN OK, so you were noticing this feeling, can you recall at that moment right when you felt that feeling, what ran through your head? 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN I think I wrote it down there, it was something about it coming on. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, yes, you wrote, I started thinking that I'm panicking. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN What I'd like to get at is the actually uncensored words that went through your head like, "Oh no, " or "Here it comes again," or. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN I don't know, I think I thought, "Oh no, not now." 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Good, now we're getting to the self-talk, "Oh no, not now." What did you think could happen? 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN I remember now, this probably sounds crazy but I thought I'm going to lose it, my friend if gonna think I'm crazy. 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Now we're getting at it. Now stay with me now, at that moment when you were very scared, how did you see yourself losing it? 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN All kinds of things went through my head, like, I thought I might lose my, I don't know, my judgment, like I might just lose it and jump out or grab the wheel and my friend would be looking at me like, she didn't know who I was or something. 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN Good Cherie. I know this isn't easy to talk about but you're doing very well here identifying the kind of self-talk we want to get at. Does it makes sense to you that picturing that kind of stuff happening is gonna make you feel frightened, panicky? 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yeah it does, it, it makes sense. I feel kind of silly because I know those things don't happen, I just can't help feeling that way. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN It's not silly. This is what panic does to us. What you can plainly see while you're calm can go out the window at those moments but it's very important to realize again that those things just don't happen. In this case, like other times when you've had panic attacks you started telling yourself to calm down. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN Yeah I just kind of said, "Stop, get a grip," um, I started trying to relax and slow down my breathing. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN And this helped? 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN And then you wrote, and although you were still feeling a little panicky, you made it home. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN Yes, and on top of it, I don't think my friend knew that I had a panic attack. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's not unusual at all. 

00:37:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE OK, well I thought that was a good example of a somewhat tedious process of, um, tying self talk to, to emotion, kind of the first step in cognitive therapy where, uh, you're trying to get a client to see that their emotions don't just come from out of the blue, they come because they're thinking about something or something's running through your mind in that way. I thought the therapist did a pretty good job starting that process. 

00:37:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. It struck me that this client has had some psychoeducation to be able to do that as effectively as she did at this stage in what we peeked in here on this demonstration. 

00:38:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, this may be some sessions down the road. 

00:38:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Sure, sure. 

00:38:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE A lot of times, uh, that kind of psychoeducation is done rather dydactively(sp), you know, just doing some education about the cognitive theory of emotions, you know not in that language. 

00:38:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Or have them read something that could help them understand this concept a little bit 

00:38:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, yep. 

00:38:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. I thought too that, uh, this was the beginning of attaching positive self talk to her thinking, that is developing some alternatives to those fearful self talk messages that build her negative emotions. She was really developing some positive self talk messages of be calm, relax. 

00:38:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE I think, uh, the therapist did a good job of allowing the client to see that when she's engaged in the kind of the fearful self talk that's associated with experiencing panic. Then she gave that example where she said, uh, "Well what did you do the one time you didn't have it," and she said, "Well I said stop and I just pulled myself," and that's a, I think, demonstrates to the client their thinking influences the emotion that they have and like, I agree with you, that's kind of the beginning of now, let's look at alternatives to this self talk, it may not just be stop, it may be something that really challenges it and move from, uh, from that. In fact, I think, you know if you just follow this through where they're going is, uh, into, uh, into converting those alternatives and fear, fearful talk into, uh, into predictions. 

00:39:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Sure and those predictions would lead to homework so they can test those predications and then build up some confidence in those alternative messages. 

00:39:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, essentially, uh, the concept of the behavioral experiment is to say, you know, my fearful thinking suggests that this could happen if I go do something, I'm gonna panic, I'm gonna lose it, I'm gonna do this and the alternative that would correct for those biases would say, well you might get anxious but, you know you may not panic. 

00:40:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. You can endure it. 

00:40:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE and even if you do, you can, yeah, you can cope with it and do that and then the idea in the behavioral experiment is to say, "Let's go do that and come back and see what happens."(crosstalk) and just build upon that. 

00:40:10
Interoceptive (Sensation Exposure) 

00:40:10
Short-Term Objectives 

00:40:10
9. Undergo gradual repeated exposure to feared physical sensations until they are no longer frightening to experience. 

00:40:10
Therapeutic Interventions 

00:40:10
1. Direct and assist the client in the construction of a hierarchy of feared sensations associated with panic attacks. 

00:40:10
2. Teach the client a sensation exposure technique in which he/she generates feared phsycial sensations through exercise (e.g., breathes rapidly until slightly lightheaded, spins in chair briefly until slightly dizzy), then uses coping strategies (e.g., staying focused on behavioral goals, muscular relaxation, evenly paced diaphragmatic breathing, positive self-talk) to calm himself/herself down; record sensations experienced and anxiety associated with each during each exercise trial; repeat exercise until anxiety wanes. 

00:40:10
3. Assign the client to read about sensation (interoceptive) exposure in books or treatment manuals on panic disorder and agoraphobia. 

00:40:10
4. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he/she does sensation exposures and records. 

00:40:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Next, let's apply interoceptive exposure to objectives and interventions used in treating panic disorder. This objective captures the general process and desired outcome of interoceptive exposure. This therapist intervention describes the practice of constructing a fear hierarchy that is commonly used to guide exposure therapy. This intervention captures the interoceptive exposure procedure in a brief general summary and there can be reading and homework assignments. 

00:40:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE A typical interoceptive or sensation exposure session begins with the client doing repetitions of an exercise, stopping and experiencing the sensations produced. Let's look in on a demonstration which the therapist is guiding the client in an initial session of interoceptive exposure. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN OK, so this exercise is intended to produce a brief sensation of feeling unbalanced. We start gradually doing one spin, then two and so on until we reach a level we can work with. Let me show you how this works. I'll start with one spin, when I stop, I'll feel the sensations, ride them out until I calm down and then record what I experienced on the form. OK? 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Alright, here we go. [sil.] OK, so I felt some unsteadiness. I also felt my heart rate go up just slightly. Now here, I put my rating of zero to 10 and if I felt any anxiety or nervousness while experiencing the dizziness, I'm gonna rate it a two but you rate what you feel when you do it. After I make my ratings, I stop and get ready to spin again. OK, why don't you begin with one spin, then stop. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Excellent, now what are you feeling? 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Actually not much. I was more nervous before then I am now. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Right, we've talked about that anticipatory anxiety and it's self talk is usually not in line with what really happens. Did you feel anything? 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN Just some slight unsteadiness. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN OK, well let's write that here. And did you have any nervousness or anxiety about what you were feeling? 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN Just a slight twinge right when I stopped and I felt the dizziness. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN OK, let's get that down. Zero to 10. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Um, I guess just a one or a two. A two, yes. 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN OK, let's do that again. Let's try three or four spins. 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:43:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. This is a novel procedure, you know that, uh, a lot of therapists aren't really familiar with this one, trying to build up some sensation tolerance of physiological changes that they're looking for. 

00:43:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah it's kind of weird. It's not traditional psychotherapy to have somebody spinning around a chair, you know, but the whole purpose of this is it's a form of exposure so people with panic after having these very frightening attacks now start to get very hyper vigilant and afraid of just having any experience of any sensation so they'll quit exercising, they'll, they'll do all kinds of things to avoid feeling that and so even though it's a little odd looking it's a, it's, it's a systematic way to expose them, uh, to, uh, to the sensations and allow them to get more comfortable and, and feel like they can manage them and fear them less. 

00:44:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. We should also comment that it's a gradual process. You know, this was an early stage demonstration and she was only turning once or twice and there wasn't really much in terms of dizziness here but this is a slow process. People are fearful of these internal states and you can't go too quickly. 

00:44:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Oh not at all. Yeah, I mean, sometimes you'll lose a, a client if you introduce this thing to quickly because they're very frightened. So yeah, this was a, a demonstration of just an introduction to this and where it's going is, you know, they're going to continue to work with this exercise and as she's able to tolerate one spins or two spins, maybe take this exercise home and practice it, come back, you're gonna build up to where your inducing very strong dizziness, depending on the person, five, 10 spins, don't stand up too quickly kind of thing, um, because the idea basically is you have to get exposure to that level of intensity to be valid and for these persons to do that. So, and so where they're also going with this, it's not demonstrated here is that they're gonna do other exercises. 

00:45:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. There are other techniques they can use to induce other kinds of physiological states? 

00:45:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Oh yeah, so they're gonna work with dizziness, they're gonna work with probably rapid breathing to produce light headedness. They may have somebody run in place. Often it starts with an assessment of doing a variety of exercises to see what sensations are feared and then, and then working with those. 

00:45:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Now, let's move on to situational exposure and it's application to panic disorder. 

00:45:45
Exteroceptive (Situational) Exposure 

00:45:45
Short-Term Objectives 

00:45:45
10. Undergo gradual repeated exposure to feared or avoided situations in which a symptom attack and its negative consequences are feared. 

00:45:45
Therapeutic Interventions 

00:45:45
1. Direct and assist the client in construction of a hierarchy of anxiety-producing situations associated with panic disorder and agoraphobia. 

00:45:45
2. Select initial exposures that have a high likelihood of being a successful experience for the client; develop a plan for managing the symptoms; rehears the plan in session. 

00:45:45
3. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he/she does situational exposures and records responses; participant model, if needed; review and reinforce success. Problem-solve obstacles; repeat. 

00:45:45
4. Assign the client to read about situational (exteroceptive) exposure in books or treatment manuals on panic disorder and agoraphobia. 

00:45:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Exposure to situation that clients fear or avoid is a key intervention used in empirically supported treatments. A client objective might be to undergo gradual repeated exposure to avoided situations in which a symptom attack and its negative consequences are feared. Regarding the therapist intervention, exposure usually begins with the construction of a hierarchy or feared activities that will guide the client through exposure exercises. It ranges from less feared to more feared situations. Initial exposures are selected, planned and typically rehearsed in session. Then they are assigned as between session homework, something referred to as exposure invivo(sp). Some therapists attend initial exposures outside the office setting and model them for the client. This technique is called participant modeling. As always, psychoeducational interventions to supplement therapeutic work may be used as described in this intervention. 

00:46:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Situational exposure is a principal of empirically supported treatments for all anxiety based problems including panic disorder. It involves having the client break the cycle of fear and avoidance by engaging them in feared activities often gradually. Although there is great flexibility in the use of exposure, the conventional format begins with the construction of a fear hierarchy. This involves working with the client to generate a list of feared activites. 

00:47:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. The exposure session typically involves these activites. 

00:47:30
Situational Exposure 

00:47:30
Select initial situations from the fear hierarchy 

00:47:30
Lay out step-by-step goals 

00:47:30
Rehearse the exposure in session 

00:47:30
Participate and model initial exposures, if needed 

00:47:30
Ask the client to do the exposure, recording periodic SUDs ratings throughout the exercise as well as thoughts, feelings, and actions they experienced 

00:47:30
Repeat exposures, to the degree possible toward the goal of doing the exposure without undue anxiety 

00:47:30
Review each exposure with the client, providing feedback for improving mastery 

00:47:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Selecting initial exposures from the hierarchy that have a high likelihood of success for the client, for each exposure, laying out step-by-step goals, rehearsing the exposure in session, participating in and modeling initial exposures if needed, asking the client to do the exposure, recording periodic SUDs ratings throughout the exercise as well as thoughts, feelings, and actions they experienced, repeating and reviewing exposures, toward the goal of doing the exposure without undue anxiety. 

00:48:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Here's a vignette that shows an initial session where a client's fear hierarchy is being developed. 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN OK, now using a zero to 10 scale, let's start with situations at the high end of that range. These are the situations that you really don't like and may not even try because of panic. What's one of those highly feared situations? 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Well, driving on the expressway, that is a 10. I haven't done that in years. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Are there other types of driving that are less then 10? 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Well, driving on a two lane road, um, I can do that if it's not too busy depending on time of day. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN So a not so busy two lane road would be a... 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN Oh I don't know, a four or a six, depending on the time of day and what road it is. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN OK, good. Let's think of some roads and times of day so that we can get more of a range of possibilities. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Well there's Burton Street say at 2:00 or 3:00 which is OK, but um... 

00:49:10
Later in the session 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN What about other situations that you fear a little less? You said you don't like to be stuck in places. 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I, I don't like waiting in line at the grocery store. If I have to do that too long it makes me feel like I just have to get out of there. 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN Well how would you rate that? 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN Um, I guess that would be about a four or a five. 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN Are there places you won't go because you might get stuck? 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN I do not go to the theater anymore. I used to go, um, and sit by the door but now I just don't go. 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN So, sitting by the door was better than in the middle. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN OK, going to the theater and sitting by the door would be what on the scale? 

00:50:00
UNKNOWN Um, I guess that would be a six or a seven but sitting anywhere else is a 10. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN OK, let's look at things that you have some anxiety about doing but you still force yourself to do them, some things that are on the lower end of the scale. 

00:50:10
Later in the session 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN OK, so watching an action movie would be a one or a two? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'll do it sometimes but sometimes I just have to stop watching. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Are there other things that you occasionally avoid but still do? 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Well, that might be calling my father on the phone. Um, I put it off sometimes because I can get nervous, especially if there's a problem or a conflict. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN OK, and what level was calling you dad? 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN I'd say it's a two. I usually like talking to my dad, especially if it's casual. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN OK, good. Let's put together what we have so far. We have two situations that are high on your fear list, driving on the expressway and going to the theater. Then you have two medium situations, driving on a two lane road and standing in a line at a grocery store. The two low level ones are watching an action movie and talking to your dad on the phone. I'm gonna ask you to take this list home and see if anything else comes to mind that you can add to it. It might help for you to ask yourself if I had a guarantee that I would never have another panic attack, what would I be doing that I'm avoiding now. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN OK, there might be some things that come to mind when I have a little more time to think about it. 

00:51:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Now that was a good representation I think of building a hierarchy. She did a nice job of moving her through low levels, medium levels and then high levels and I think she needs to see this homework as being a part of it too. 

00:51:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I mean she has an option of, this is I think a good demonstration of her going through building the hierarchy in the session and, uh, one option is, uh, to assign this as a homework. 

00:52:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Yeah in the early stages. Now she did it at the end where she tries to help her fill in some things but she could do that at the early stages too. 

00:52:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah in my practice even before a client has come, if they complained of an anxiety problem, a form usually goes out that says, you know, list some of the situations, rate how anxious they are for your void, you can do any of those kinds of ratings and then you can use that to, to do this process and really refine that. 

00:52:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Yeah, walk them through it step-by-step and fill in any gaps and so on. 

00:52:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, yeah I think she did a good job of, like you said, um, uh, and what you want to accomplish is get some doable practical activities at low level anxieties, the ones, twos and threes 

00:52:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. They may even be doing those things. 

00:52:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE They probably are. 

00:52:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. But with distress. 

00:52:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I mean a lot of times the ratings correspond to the level of avoidance so 10's are always avoided and ones, twos and threes are things that they're doing but maybe they do them with distress, like you say. Another thing, last thing I think I want to say about this is that, uh, that question of saying, you know, if you weren't gonna have a panic attack, what would you be doing that you're not doing now, that's a real good way to just get a good list of where fear's controlling this person's life. 

00:53:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Set a framework for them. 

00:53:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, absolutely. 

00:53:15
Other Common Approaches 

00:53:15
Psychodynamic interventions Previous trauma Childhood abuse Family situations 

00:53:15
Family/Conjoint Therapy to reinforce progress 

00:53:15
Enhancing motivation through "Stage of Change" interventions 

00:53:15
Prescribing or referring for medication 

00:53:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Therapists working with panic disorder have also commonly used other approaches that may be part of an overall treatment plan. Examples include psychodynamic interventions exploring previous trauma, childhood abuse, or family situations, family or conjoint therapy to reinforce progress, enhancing motivation through stage of change interventions and prescribing or referring for medication. 

00:53:45
Relapse Prevention Interventions 

00:53:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Although there's evidence that empirically supported psychological treatments for panic disorder have lower relapse rates than comparable pharmacological treatments, panic disorder is vulnerable to relapse. Accordingly, many of these ESTs take common steps to help clients avoid the pitfalls of relapse. 

00:54:05
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:54:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Let's take a look at some common considerations in relapse prevention for panic disorder and how they can be incorporated into a treatment plan. 

00:54:10
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:54:10
Explain rationale of prevention interventions 

00:54:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. One of the first steps in relapse prevention is to provide a rationale for it. This typically involves a discussion in the risk of relapse and how the relapse prevention approaches we outline can lower that risk. 

00:54:25
Therapeutic Interventions 

00:54:25
1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention that discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 

00:54:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this. 

00:54:35
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:54:35
Explain rationale of prevention interventions 

00:54:35
Distinguish between lapse and relapse 

00:54:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Another early step is to distinguish between a lapse and a relapse. A lapse is prevented as a not uncommon temporary setback that may involve, for example, re-experiencing thoughts and or urges to avoid some things that have been previously associated with the panic disorder. Relapse on the other hand is described as a return to a sustained pattern of panic attacks or the fearful and avoidant approach that characterized the client's actions during the panic disorder. 

00:55:05
2. Discuss with the client the distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with an initial and reversible return of symptoms, fear, or urges to avoid and relapse with eh decision to return to fearful and avoidant patterns. 

00:55:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE This component of relapse prevention can be captured in a therapist's intervention such as this one.

00:55:15
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:55:15
Explain rationale of prevention interventions 

00:55:15
Distinguish between lapse and relapse 

00:55:15
Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse 

00:55:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Accordingly high risk situations that might make the client vulnerable to a lapse are identified. This discussion may be informed by past, difficult experiences or anticipated new ones. 

00:55:35
High-Risk Situations 

00:55:35
Having strong anticipatory anxiety in a situation after not having had these experiences for some time 

00:55:35
Deciding to avoid a situation after having not done that for some time 

00:55:35
Having an upcoming situation that has not come up for some time and that may need to be rehearsed 

00:55:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Some examples include having strong anticipatory anxiety or anxiety symptoms in a situation after not having had these for some time, deciding to avoid a situation after having not done that for awhile, having an upcoming situation that might need to be rehearsed for example, a plane flight or traveling far from home. 

00:55:55

00:55:55
Explain rationale of prevention interventions 

00:55:55
Distinguish between lapse and relapse 

00:55:55
Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse 

00:55:55
Review the application of skills learned in therapy to high-risk situations 

00:55:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE For the high risk situations identified the therapies and client rehearse coping with each of them, using skills learned in therapy, including the skill of developing a tolerance for occasional anxious thoughts and feelings while working on problem solving them. 

00:56:10
3. Identify and rehears with the client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur. 

00:56:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Identifying and rehearsing the management of high risk situations can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention, such as this one. 

00:56:20

00:56:20

00:56:20

00:56:20
Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse 

00:56:20
Review the application of skills learned in therapy to high-risk situations 

00:56:20
Encourage routine use of skills 

00:56:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. In addition to using skills learned in therapy to manage high risk situations clients are also encouraged to integrate their use into day to day lives. This usually includes the goal of engaging in previously avoided situations on a routine basis. 

00:56:40
4. Instruct the client to routinely use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., cognitive resturcuring, exposure), building them into his/her life as much as possible. 

00:56:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Therapist intervention number four captures this in the treatment plan. Sometimes clients benefit from having a coping card or other reminder of important strategies and information regarding relapse prevention. 

00:57:00
5. Develop a "coping card" on which coping strategies and other important information (e.g., "pace your breathing," "focus on the task at hand," "you can manage it," and "it will go away") are written for the client's later use. 

00:57:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. If you decide to use this aid, it can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as number five.

00:57:10
Encourage routine use of skills 

00:57:10
Schedule periodic "booster" sessions 

00:57:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Finally periodic booster sessions of therapy can help maintain positive therapeutic gains so clients are invited to periodically revisit therapy to strength and reinforce their new approach to panic situations and or problem solve any challenges. 

00:57:30
6. Schedule periodic maintenance or "booster" sessions to help the client maintain therapeutic gains and problem-solve challenges 

00:57:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Treatment intervention number six shows the use of this in the treatment plan. 

00:57:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA JR. Today's discussion focused on empirically informing treatment plans using goals, objectives and treatment interventions consistent with those found in empirically supported treatments. These treatments must all be delivered within the context of an authentic, empathic relationship. As you can see, there's a significant body of research in this area. The accompanied guide provides you with additional clinical resources as well as references to empirical support for the interventions we discussed today. 

00:58:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE We want to remind you that the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of empirically informed psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health and substance abuse problems. It's designed to be informative in nature and doesn't intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed or demonstrated.
