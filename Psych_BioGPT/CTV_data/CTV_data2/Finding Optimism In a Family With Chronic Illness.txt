ZOY KAZAN The people we’re putting behind the mirror here to support you in your goals and so that will be reflecting, they’re not going to evaluate in any way, their job is really support. And to hear and listen carefully and to reflect on what they hear. And my previous experience with teams is that, people, families come out of having a team experience, say well, that was worth at least three sessions of therapy because they just so much from it both and it helps us to learn. So thank you. So I think, I will start with you because you invited the family to come and I am guessing you have some hopes for this session. And I just wondered what your hopes for these sessions are and then I am going to ask you what your hopes for the session are. So 

00:01:20
 Ruby put it as open more space, and I kind of put it as maybe find new areas to explore that would be therapeutic and helpful. 

00:01:30
ZOY KAZAN Can I ask you a little bit more about that. When you say you want to open more space, it seems to me that you’re feeling like you need more space. There is a little bit of like maybe stuffiness or maybe you’re not experiencing enough space in the sessions now. 

00:01:50
 I think that’s something we come back to frequently is kind of a stuck feeling Becky has experienced very little hope for change and our sense is that, that will be nearly helpful to her, there were feeling of more movement, more options. 

00:02:10
ZOY KAZAN Okay, okay. So sort of stuffiness, maybe some hopelessness that’s you’re experiencing that you experience in the room. 

00:02:20
 We’re happy to spend time. 

00:02:20
ZOY KAZAN  Yeah. 

00:02:25
 With this one wonderful family, but we’re not feeling like we’re moving with them a lot. 

00:02:30
ZOY KAZAN Okay, okay. 

00:02:30
 Which would be my fault. 

00:02:35
ZOY KAZAN Oh, I don’t think. 

00:02:35
 Oh. 

00:02:35
ZOY KAZAN Some problems feel insurmountable and sometimes we can’t, we don’t have much room to move. So let’s not blame you or anyone else if the problem is insurmountable. Let’s just look at how much room there is and if there is room to open up space, let’s do it, but there is no blame. 

00:03:00
 Okay. 

00:03:00
ZOY KAZAN Okay. So what are you hoping for today? I’ll ask each of you. 

00:03:05
 It, for me, it’s just wait and see proposition. 

00:03:10
ZOY KAZAN Wait and see, okay. 

00:03:10
 Yeah, see what, you know you open up a door and you kind of, sometimes you get surprised by what’s on the other side, sometimes you don’t. So but it's always nice to find very nice surprises may come on through and let’s see what develops. 

00:03:25
ZOY KAZAN So you would be interested in there being a door that we could open, if there was one. 

00:03:30
 If there is one needs to be open, yes. 

00:03:30
ZOY KAZAN Okay. 

00:03:30
 Sure. 

00:03:30
ZOY KAZAN Okay. 

00:03:30
 For me, I don’t usually come to the session, so I am not involved in what they talk about and they don’t bring it home. They don’t involve me at home or anything. So I guess for me, it’s just, if there an issue, we need to talk about with me or something that I can help stay involved with and that’s why I am here. 

00:03:55
ZOY KAZAN Okay. And so, how many times have you been to sessions with your parents? 

00:04:00
 Oh, as kids, as when we’re younger, many times, but now. 

00:04:00
ZOY KAZAN But in this sequence. 

00:04:05
 Once, once before. 

00:04:05
ZOY KAZAN So this is your second visit with them, oh, wow. 

00:04:10
 Last time it was, my sisters and I were both here. And that’s just, they’re same as me. They’re sick today. So… 

00:04:15
ZOY KAZAN Aha, okay. And Becky, what about you? What would your role be? 

00:04:20
 Well, you know -- I know, I’d frustrate them and I feel really bad. I mean, I feel badly about it. I just – I can’t be dishonest. I can’t – I am not going to play any games. I would be very happy, if we could just get done what we had to get done in a couple of weeks or just in this session and then just move on. My personality is just, let’s just do it and get it over with. But I don’t feel that kind of success and it’s not their fault, it’s because I just don’t see a lot out of it. 

00:04:45
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:04:45
 I don’t see a lot of hope. 

00:04:50
ZOY KAZAN And so, being honest with the therapists is really important to you. 

00:04:55
 Oh, yeah. 

00:04:55
ZOY KAZAN And being honest with you so for and your family. Yeah. 

00:04:55
 And it’s a good day, so you guys were lucky. 

00:05:00
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:05:00
 I feel good day. 

00:05:00
ZOY KAZAN So a good day, tell me about a good day. 

00:05:00
 Well, I am not morose, I don’t feel overwhelmed by the hopelessness of things. I am not sure why. I think it’s just -- 

00:05:15
ZOY KAZAN Good days happen. 

00:05:15
 Yeah. 

00:05:15
ZOY KAZAN Could you – do you know that it’s going to be a good day when you wake up in the morning? 

00:05:20
  Sometimes. 

00:05:25
ZOY KAZAN What’s the first sign of a good day? 

00:05:30
 I don’t start thinking negative thoughts despite the dream, any dreaming. Last night alright, this was my plan, somebody stole up my plans. 

00:05:40
ZOY KAZAN Oh! no. 

00:05:40
 In my dreams 

00:05:45
 In her dreams. 

00:05:45
ZOY KAZAN Oh! in your dreams, not in reality. 

00:05:45
 Not in reality. 

00:05:45
ZOY KAZAN Oh, that’s good. So you were probably relieved when you woke up to think, oh, my, we still have my plans. Yeah. 

00:05:55
 And so, it didn’t kind of, it just didn’t start with a lot of negative. And really the negative days are less and less. I just still don’t see a lot of hope for solutions. I just my days aren’t as negative. 

00:06:05
ZOY KAZAN Oh, and out of the seven days of the week, how many do you think are negative? 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:20
 Of late probably maybe one. 

00:06:20
ZOY KAZAN Only one negative day in a week. 

00:06:25
 That’s been a couple of weeks, right? 

00:06:25
ZOY KAZAN Well, over the last two weeks. 

00:06:30
 Couple two weeks, since we last saw you. 

00:06:30
ZOY KAZAN Are you surprised to hear this? 

00:06:35
 Yeah, I mean, maybe I would have said, half a day, so, that’s good. 

00:06:40
 That’s true. But at least things were better last time we met. 

00:06:45
ZOY KAZAN Alright. And how many days were negative before you started meeting? 

00:06:50
  Seven. 

00:06:55
ZOY KAZAN Oh, so now six out of seven days for the last two weeks have been okay. So, but you’re still feeling… 

00:07:10
 We’re here, we can go now? 

00:07:10
ZOY KAZAN Well, but you’re still feeling a certain amount of hopelessness and frustration. 

00:07:15
 Yeah, I think I’ve just resigned myself to this is the way it is. 

00:07:20
ZOY KAZAN Tell me more because, you know, I am not in the picture enough to understand. 

00:07:25
 I know, there is not a lot of solutions. I don’t see a lot of solutions to the financial aspect of having a home, being able to do the things that I feel that we’re supposed to be doing in “retirement” or certainly headed in that direction. 

00:07:40
ZOY KAZAN Oh, I see. 

00:07:40
 There just no, I mean, we did get news that our house in Wisconsin is going to sell, but all that’s going to do, is pay our bills then we’re still are left with nothing. So... 

00:07:50
ZOY KAZAN So the idea of retirement and needing money to retire on is helping create the hopelessness. 

00:08:00
 That’s part of it. 

00:08:00
ZOY KAZAN And what else was there? 

00:08:05
 That’s probably the main thing because it’ll have all the twins in with or intertwines with not having a house, not having room to have family and kids and grandkids and… 

00:08:15
ZOY KAZAN Right, right. So where do you live now? 

00:08:20
 At a church camp. 

00:08:20
ZOY KAZAN And how long have you lived there for? 

00:08:25
 Year and a half. Year and a half, well. 

00:08:30
ZOY KAZAN And what’s it like there? 

00:08:30
 Busy. 

00:08:35
ZOY KAZAN Lots of people. 

00:08:35
 I am the resident nurse through all summer and then in the weekends. And Hall is on maintenance. And it’s – they’re very demanding and Tommy works in the Kitchen. 

00:08:45
ZOY KAZAN You all work there. 

00:08:50
 Yeah. 

00:08:50
ZOY KAZAN Oh, wow. 

00:08:50
 That’s kind of like your, most Christian place, they think you’re slave so, but it’s part of what, you know, you knowingly get into when you go there. But they provided us housing. When Tommy needed to get out of the desert heat, because we were living at little mobile home in the desert because of the illness. 

00:09:10
ZOY KAZAN So illness is being one of the motivating factors in the family moving. 

00:09:15
 Yes. 

00:09:15
ZOY KAZAN When you’re moving to… 

00:09:15
 Without question. 

00:09:15
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, okay. And I’ve heard from a previous discussion yesterday, she saying that, that there has been quite a lot of illness in your family and that that’s been difficult or is difficult for everyone. Is that true or… 

00:09:35
 I don’t know difficult is the word, it’s just accepted. 

00:09:35
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, you live with it. 

00:09:35
  Yeah. 

00:09:40
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, does the illness in the family contribute to the sense of hopelessness or is… 

00:09:45
 I don’t see it. But I, to say that it isn’t difficult, I am not saying that hasn’t been difficult going through and watching family members and myself ill isn’t been difficult, it’s just we kind of accept the day-to-day stuff. 

00:10:00
ZOY KAZAN So how have you learned to be so accepting in the phase of serious illness in the family? What’s helped you to do this? 

00:10:10
 Probably having a medical background. 

00:10:15
ZOY KAZAN Being a nurse. So knowledge is... 

00:10:20
 I think so. 

00:10:20
ZOY KAZAN The knowledge of what’s going on. So Tommy, I believe, you are one of the people with a serious illness. And how do you see your mother’s acceptance, how does that influence you dealing with the illness? 

00:10:35
 I think, I learned from both my parents when it first happened just, she told me, you know, she informed me a lot the same way, you know knowledge was good to know. It helped in knowing what is going on, but as far as just accepting it, I think, I learned that just, you can’t – I can’t change things, that’s how I am now, I just – if I can’t it, you know, maybe as well just live with it. So I don’t – there is some days when I am down about it, but the majority of days I just take it as it comes. It hurt, pain, and I have a lot of pain, but, you can’t change that either. So, I just… 

00:11:10
ZOY KAZAN So you’re sort of living with a certain level of pain and discomfort and… 

00:11:15
 Most recently in the last few months definitely, but and before it was something about a month, sort of that months at a time that were good, and sometimes that’s bad, but lately it’s been lot more bad than good so, as far as pains goes. 

00:11:30
ZOY KAZAN And historically, are there periods where you go through a painful time and then you come out it and things are better or does – is it progressive… 

00:11:40
 Well, I’ve only had it my disease for two and a half years now. And the most recent is like my hips were going bad. So, it’s just pain from the hip itself, but as far as in the past, I think, yeah, like there would be, like when I was on chemo, that was bad, and I knew there would be an end to it, so there was something to look forward to. So I knew there was an end. 

00:12:00
ZOY KAZAN I am not sure if, me, exploring the impact of illness on the family is where you want to go today. And so, I would just want to come back to our original questions, where we were really looking at what you hoped for. I sometimes think that if we think that there is no hope with any problem, we tend to not see the, any openings that could be there. I mean, is that what hopelessness does to you that it, it’s like painting a room black and there is no light because hopelessness will just make sure that we don’t see if there is a window or if there is a door or even if there is a small crack in the wall. 

00:12:40
 Right. It’s not going to change even if you show me some cracks, it’s not going to change the reality where we were. 

00:12:45
ZOY KAZAN Tell me what is the reality? 

00:12:50
 We bought a house in Wisconsin and we’re going to live in a little mobile home in the desert. It’s not very big in Wisconsin, but it’s by a river it’s got, it’s what you dream of if you like being outdoor. And so I think when you got sick, there was just no question, we had to be here. And he came back to the desert house and it was too hot for him because lupus it’s, the sun is and heat is lupus patients worst enemy. So it was clear we couldn’t stay there. So that’s why we ended up in the mountains. 

00:13:20
ZOY KAZAN How is the financial position influencing retirement. 

00:13:20
 Now we have to sell Wisconsin. We can’t have some place that we’re not living in. But even if we sell that house, it’s just going to pay off the bills that we’ve accrued. 

00:13:30
ZOY KAZAN So debt, worry about debts and paying debts is part of the hopelessness? 

00:13:35
 Yeah, I don’t, you know, I feel like I have to keep working. I don’t know a transplant patient that’s lived already as long as I have. So here I am working, thinking I am not going to ever be able to stop working. I feel like that’s just exactly what’s going to happen. We’re not going to have any time. And it’s affecting our relationship, I mean, we’re not – we’re getting further and further apart, because we have no real life together. We don’t really do anything, we just work. 

00:14:00
ZOY KAZAN I guess you’re like a lot of Americans who don’t have retirement plans or don’t have – don’t have any money put aside for that. 

00:14:10
 That’s a lot of us fools out there, yeah. 

00:14:10
ZOY KAZAN It takes a lot of money to put aside for retirement. And you have to start fairly young. 

00:14:15
 Well, we could have done it in three or four different ways. We had everything paid off about twice. We could have easily done it, we just didn’t. We just – we had not had good training. We didn’t ask any advise and we just made decisions that were poor. 

00:14:30
ZOY KAZAN So you’ve made those decisions in the past and now you’re here and looking down the barrel that look obviously working for a long time. And that, I mean, that sounds like there is some bitterness about that? 

00:14:45
 Oh, very much so. 

00:14:50
ZOY KAZAN Is bitterness something that everyone experiences about it or is it mainly your concern? 

00:14:55
 No, I don’t think so. 

00:14:55
ZOY KAZAN What about you Hall, does the bitterness, do you experience the bitterness, do you have a share in that or… 

00:15:00
 No, because I don’t have the negative attitude that she has, number one. And I have a retirement income… 

00:15:10
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:15:10
 You know that’s adequate, you know, a lot of things being equal, you know. So, I don’t see things the same way she does. 

00:15:20
ZOY KAZAN How do you invite hope into your life when you’re obviously facing difficult things, how do you do that? 

00:15:30
 Going to like, I maybe I’ve worked off on Tommy, you know, life is, you know, when you’re out at certain position you got to deal with it, you know, and work to move on. You have to, you know, you may not be overcome it, but you at least learn to live with it, you know, and try to deal with it and make it about good as you can. 

00:15:50
ZOY KAZAN I heard you all say something like that at the beginning, you have to live with it, you have to deal with things if you can’t… 

00:15:55
 It’s just so many years of, you know, we’ve been married 19 years next month. And we had one year without any major problems and then bam, then she had – her liver disease was diagnosed, you know. And so, you know, we had four years of, I guess it was about four years right of dealing with her and she was just going steadily downhill. That’s just the way the disease goes and then she had her transplant and it was overcome that and moved on for a little while further then Christie the oldest and one of three at home... 

00:16:35
 That is the (inaudible ) right down there. She… 

00:16:36
 You know, she comes down with lupus. She know how do we deal with that one and then Tommy comes down with lupus. 

00:16:40
ZOY KAZAN Right, right. 

00:16:40
 And then the middle daughter gets, she kind of, she is a lot of emotionally she is I think would be adequate to say about how she is seeing her brother and sisters suffer. So, now she is going, is it going to happen to me and why does it always have to happen to them. And I am the one that’s, you know, that, why am I here the one that’s well, it’s what’s she’s kind of what I’ve heard her say. So you get all of that stuff, you know. And for me, you know, I mean, yeah, you could let her overwhelm you, you can let it beat you down, but I am not – I don’t want to do that, I want to try to make the best what I can to try to, you know, I, you know, we’re a Christian family. We may not always pray together, but I know individually, we consider our situation and of with that, you know, and let, I think maybe the strength comes from that, so. 

00:17:40
ZOY KAZAN So, your faith has really… 

00:17:45
 Yes. 

00:17:45
ZOY KAZAN Helped you to keep going and accept the multiple problems. 

00:17:50
 Well, from time to time… 

00:17:50
 Yeah, and let me – let’s be real fair and clear here. I’ve always been the optimist. 

00:17:55
 Yep, she was. 

00:17:55
 You know, I mean, through illness even I was dying everything, I was perpetual, all my life I have been the perpetual optimist. And you for the most part have been the negative one hugely, but he has also had – we’ve had our problems with all the three kids too, physical problems and premature births and cancer and in law school and medical school, I mean, so we’ve, you know, it’s been, for him, it’s been larger picture because it’s been a lot of the kids even though I am involved in their lives as well. So he’s got six kids in a lot of sense. So he is pretty much been the negative one about everything and I’ve been lifting him up until this whole thing started. 

00:18:30
ZOY KAZAN How did you stand up to that negative attitude because you’ve seem to have transformed that? 

00:18:35
 Time away from it. 

00:18:40
 I got it – once I got away from it, yeah, it… 

00:18:40
ZOY KAZAN Time out 

00:18:45
 Yeah… 

00:18:45
 Because he is different now than when we were – when he was working… 

00:18:45
 Eight, it’s been eight years since I’ve retired right. That must have played into it pretty significantly I would guess. 

00:18:50
ZOY KAZAN Getting away from other people with a negative attitude. 

00:18:55
 Well, getting away from… 

00:18:55
 The stress. 

00:18:55
 The dregs of society and dealing with the, with crime… 

00:19:00
ZOY KAZAN So getting away from that really helped you to step away from your own negative attitude. 

00:19:05
 I think. 

00:19:05
 I think so. 

00:19:05
 Yeah, and retrospectively I would guess so. 

00:19:10
 Big difference. 

00:19:10
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:19:10
 Because you still pretty much see the worst in a lot of things. 

00:19:10
 Well, you know, I mean… 

00:19:15
 But not like them. 

00:19:15
ZOY KAZAN So Tommy, you just said something about noticing your dad has changed since then. 

00:19:20
 Yeah. 

00:19:20
ZOY KAZAN What are the changes you see in him in terms of his attitude and optimism? 

00:19:30
 Like now, my girlfriend, I will refer to him as a teddy bear, because now let’s just, he is just nice like, he always gives hugs like to my girlfriend and her sisters and everything. He always, you know, hugging and always has something nice to say, call them nice names and has nicknames for them. But before he would never have done that. I think when he was working he was just, he was kind of the same thing, like all the things he goes through, you know kindness I don’t think is the first thing on your mind. 

00:19:55
ZOY KAZAN No, I don’t think you’re trained to be kind. 

00:20:00
 No, I think time away from being in that stress or just in that job has definitely been the good thing for him. 

00:20:05
ZOY KAZAN What difference has that made in your life seeing the changes that Hall has made? How has that influenced you in terms of the sort of person you want to become and how you deal with problems? 

00:20:15
 Well, I’ve always learned since young, I’ve learned great life lessons from him, but recently that’s, I guess, as far as my illness goes with, like if you’ve seeing into the future, I mean, it gives me a little bit of a positive outlook on things like, how I look at things too, I mean, the last two years definitely, but since I graduated high school I think he has changed – I have changed a lot. 

00:20:35
ZOY KAZAN You said, you’ve learned some lessons since graduating high school. What would you say was the most important lesson that you’ve learned since then? 

00:20:45
 Maturing, you know, just growing into an adult I think was a big deal like right after high school. 

00:20:55
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:20:55
 You know, getting on in my own, going back to Minnesota was a big change like where I had to – like I didn’t, I guess, I did become a different person because the opportunity was there to just turn everything around and go in a different direction. But I think that was the major point and then a lot of the – and then getting sick probably set me in accepting the way I accept things is for what they are whereas before I could have complaint there, just kept complaining, I don’t complaint that much just because I know I can’t change things. So I try not to complain. Plus they, like they have… 

00:21:30
ZOY KAZAN So the illness sort of really taught you something about acceptance. 

00:21:35
 Yeah, always, yeah. 

00:21:35
ZOY KAZAN Did your faith have a part in that? 

00:21:35
 Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah, absolutely from when I got sick, even before that when I moved out, I totally, I changed the direction I wanted to go. When I moved out there, I found a good church and I think that really set my mind of where I wanted to take my future and my family – where I thought I was going to have family in the future, where I wanted that to go and everything too so. 

00:22:00
ZOY KAZAN How do you think that influences the people you have in – your friends and people in your church community where you are now at the camp? 

00:22:10
 Well, the friends I had before, I don’t even keep in contact with. But there is a few that I still do. And now I am a good influence on the people I do stay in contact with, my best friend now. As far as the camp is concerned, I am not too involved with the kids or anyone there. I am kind of… 

00:22:25
 Just Church… 

00:22:25
 Yeah, church, I teach the children there a couple of times a month. I do the Sunday school. So I mean, I try and stay involved even though I am not feeling well some day, I’ll still do it just because makes me feel good to be involved that way. 

00:22:45
ZOY KAZAN Do they know that? 

00:22:45
 Well, the kids in there. I am sure, I try, I mean, some days I am bad and I just, I can’t, like, I am not the most positive person around them, but I’ll let them know that I am not feeling well beforehand and they will understand. They are good kids too, so. 

00:22:55
ZOY KAZAN So you’re teaching them something when you’re open with them about what’s going on with you. 

00:23:00
 I think so. 

00:23:05
 Well, I might and I always try and watch what they’re doing and if I do it – I can put input into what they’re saying or doing or the way they’re interacting with each other, I try to even if I am not teaching that day, I am still – they’re always around me when I am there. Like you know. 

00:23:15
ZOY KAZAN His mum always refers to him as the Pied Piper. 

00:23:20
ZOY KAZAN Pied Piper, the kids follow… 

00:23:20
  Always. 

00:23:25
ZOY KAZAN Wanted about that. 

00:23:25
 Tommy was also our juvenile delinquent. 

00:23:25
ZOY KAZAN You’re joking. 

00:23:30
 No, he was. It was love-hate with Tommy always. And most of the time we hated him. 

00:23:35
ZOY KAZAN Really. Hard to believe. 

00:23:35
 All the way to those senior in high school and that’s when I kind of. 

00:23:40
 He was taken away for years, he was in juvenile hall, he was – yeah, we didn’t, Hall, didn’t give him much hope an adulthood. 

00:23:45
 I don’t think many people gave me much in there. 

00:23:45
 No, but we kept you. 

00:23:50
ZOY KAZAN Well, that’s a huge transformation. 

00:23:50
 Yeah. 

00:23:50
ZOY KAZAN Was there a turning point where you decided you didn’t want to spend the rest of life behind bars. 

00:23:55
 I think high school, senior and high school when I had to because I messed around the first three year of high school and I didn’t do much homework or anything. So I failed a bunch of classes. So when I got to that that senior year and I was looking at whether I was going to graduate or not graduate and I had to do this work and I have to make sure I got it done. I think that kind of finishing high school, making sure I wanted to finish and then what I was going to do after that when I moved to Minnesota really, really changed what I wanted to do. So, you know, I had, I mean, we’ve always had things like, as kids, we always had things. So I didn’t have, I knew I had options when I left school, but I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do yet, and I went to school where I am going now and I quit to go back to Minnesota to just try to go to college and I think that transition when I was leaving school, I am trying to figure out where I wanted to go and I just made. And then opportune, like I said, when I moved back, the opportunity was to just to drop everything that I was going through before. A few friends that I had that were negative influencers. And I had the opportunity just to drop and find new friends. So I was just – I did – and I went towards the positive route instead of… 

00:25:00
ZOY KAZAN So you took that opportunity, you chose that. 

00:25:00
 And like I’ve always been raised in Christian homes. So it wasn’t that far the leap, it wasn’t that much of a opposite turnaround. It was just kind of knowing the right way and just going that way. So it’s – yeah. 

00:25:15
ZOY KAZAN And how old where you when your mom went through the transplant? 

00:25:20
 Five. I was five. 

00:25:20
ZOY KAZAN Do you remember that time very well? 

00:25:25
 I remember, not very well, but I do remember her being sick. Not her physically sick, I don’t really remember how she looked or… 

00:25:35
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:25:35
 Where she was, but I do remember when she was called in for the surgery, visiting her in the hospital and then being at home afterwards I do remember that. 

00:25:40
ZOY KAZAN Right. Did you see that change your mother in anyway? 

00:25:45
 You know, I can’t tell. She was, even afterwards she was still a mother, she was still really involved as a mom and keeping us involved in sports or anything else, trying to be a mom, so, no, I don’t think it changed her attitude very much at that point. She was still really positive all the time. And I don’t think she was going to let, for us, probably for our sake more than anything let it affect her. 

00:26:10
  One thing I’ve got to say is, it was not that significant, but it is as it – when she was at her sickest, you know, and she was having esophageal bleeds, couple of times a month I think it was and this was just pre-transplant. And this one would get up in the morning and this is the woman who used to get up at 4:30 in the morning and do aerobics and just go like, about you know, what all day long. You know and when she got slammed with her liver disease, it dropped her down to where she was, she get up in time to get the kids up in the morning, get them dressed, feed them and get them off to school, she go back to bed, but she’d back up at 3:30 in the afternoon when they got home, get dinner ready whenever got everything done, let them have as normal life as she can easily manage at that point and then she would go back to bed. 

00:27:00
 See – we –I didn’t see that, we didn’t see those… 

00:27:05
 She worked, she busted her hinge to make sure she was a good mom. 

00:27:05
 See, we didn’t – we didn’t see that, I didn’t see that. She is like, we were always… 

00:27:10
ZOY KAZAN You saw her being a normal mum. 

00:27:10
 Yeah, exactly so. 

00:27:10
 That’s true. 

00:27:15
ZOY KAZAN That’s incredible and you knew that story. 

00:27:15
 I didn’t see her illness… 

00:27:20
ZOY KAZAN Did you know that story before today? 

00:27:20
 I knew she – yeah, well, not to that extend. Not to where she was going bad every time, but no. 

00:27:25
ZOY KAZAN So it sounds like you have a legacy from your mother and from your father, your stepfather. 

00:27:35
 Yes. 

00:27:35
ZOY KAZAN That’s about being, able to make change, able to accept what you can’t change, but able to keep a level of optimism. 

00:27:40
 I think so. 

00:27:45
ZOY KAZAN That’s a legacy from both your parents. And that you were having a period now where it’s hard to keep optimism, so that’s kind of slipped away from you. Yeah. I wonder if there is any other time in your life when you’ve lost your optimism. 

00:28:00
  Perhaps, but it didn’t last long. 

00:28:05
ZOY KAZAN Do you remember when that could have been? 

00:28:10
 All, every crisis. 

00:28:10
ZOY KAZAN Every crisis. 

00:28:10
 Yeah, but it didn’t last, it was just part of what, you know, you just – you think negative thoughts because it’s part of how you’re processing what am I going to do from this point on now. And there being major crisis. You know. 

00:28:25
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:28:25
 Probably one of the worst has probably been my mom’s death of all of them. But again, I think it’s been an accumulation for me. But every one of 'em I just, you know, okay, now do I commit suicide, do I run away, do I, you know, what do I do? I mean, you know, you put all your options in front of you every time you have – at least I do every major crisis and there has been so many of them. So that’s not unusual. 

00:28:45
ZOY KAZAN When did your mother die? 

00:28:50
 My birthday… 

00:28:55
 Six. 

00:28:55
 Six years ago. 

00:28:55
 Six years, I think. 

00:28:55
 Six years ago. 

00:28:55
ZOY KAZAN What date is… 

00:28:55
 So this January will be seven years. 

00:29:00
ZOY KAZAN What date your birthday? 

00:29:00
 January 29th. 

00:29:00
ZOY KAZAN So your grandmother died on January 29th. 

00:29:05
 It will be this – this year will be seven years. This January will be seven years. 

00:29:10
ZOY KAZAN And what’s the legacy from your grandmother to you? What did she, what were her gifts to you that you carry inside yourself? 

00:29:20
 She was always hard working. Always involved, she was always involved in our lives. We didn’t live too far from her, so we did she her a lot of the time. Just good memories out of house, whole lots of good memories, going out and visiting her at her desert home where we have our place now. And then just lots of good memories. 

00:29:40
ZOY KAZAN If she was able to speak with you and look at the changes that you have made in your life between when you were in juvenile hall and now, what would your grandmother say? 

00:29:55
 I don’t know. I honestly don’t know what she would say now. Maybe... 

00:30:00
ZOY KAZAN Now, you… 

00:30:05
 She probably have been proud in a way, but I don’t know, she wasn’t – she wouldn’t have shown that much, so I don’t know. She would probably be better at. 

00:30:10
ZOY KAZAN You were smiling just a few seconds ago when… 

00:30:15
 No, she probably wouldn’t have said too much, she just, she would just expect him all but graduate from college. And that would have made her the happiest. It couldn’t have been the other little stuff, it would have been the ultimate. 

00:30:25
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:30:25
 You know, once… 

00:30:25
ZOY KAZAN And when he did that… 

00:30:30
 He graduate from college, he get married in their own, their own, they don’t bother me anymore. That’s what the best… 

00:30:30
ZOY KAZAN She is very down-to-earth. 

00:30:30
  Yeah. 

00:30:35
 Yeah. 

00:30:35
ZOY KAZAN Would you – would you describe her as an optimist? 

00:30:35
 Constantly. 

00:30:35
ZOY KAZAN  Constantly. 

00:30:40
 Nauseatingly. 

00:30:40
ZOY KAZAN And was that her legacy to you as well? 

00:30:45
 Part of it. 

00:30:50
ZOY KAZAN What else does she, what else do you remember of her that you carry on in your own life? 

00:30:55
 Not as much as I like to, but I would – I thought I, her – the greatest gift she have to me was zeal for living, but that hasn’t, that hasn’t the case anymore, but that’s what I would have said initially. The greatest gift she gave me was her zeal for everything was an adventure, everything was, you know what can we do to have fun and always optimistic and incredible support. She was just always very, very supportive. 

00:31:20
 You still have that know in some ways? 

00:31:25
 No. 

00:31:25
 Hey, you do. 

00:31:25
ZOY KAZAN Tell us how Tommy. 

00:31:25
 Oh, when, get her any of her grandkids around her and she is that way the whole time they’re around, as you have finding the things for them to do and getting them, take – what can they do next or, you know, even now, like, this morning, oh, what she said, I have such a bad memory now that, she made, Judith made a comment, she was just always -- she just was so optimistic about I think, I can't remember what is was, but I think there has been something about school or something for me. I don’t know what she said. 

00:31:55
 Little Tommy is in the bank in Orange County. 

00:32:00
 Something like that, I wasn’t there. But it was just – it was a positive thing. It was just. You guys are, you’re not going to let it go or… 

00:32:05
 I didn’t say a word. 

00:32:05
 You’re laughing, that’s... 

00:32:10
 Yeah, she is laughing. 

00:32:10
 We have say that. You have say it, no. 

00:32:10
 I am not going to say. 

00:32:10
 Can we say it or no. 

00:32:15
 If you really want to. 

00:32:15
 Hall was just – he was hysterical this morning. He just sat there and told Tommy that, he says, little Tommy… 

00:32:20
 She had me on video recorder. 

00:32:20
 Safe for another year. Tommy donated his sperm in this bank, for the bank in Orange County. So he just told Tommy today that he paid. 

00:32:30
 It’s not donated. It’s mine, it’s, I own it still. They’re not… 

00:32:35
 Yeah, true. 

00:32:35
 Take it. 

00:32:35
ZOY KAZAN He is not a donor. 

00:32:35
 It’s because – because chemo, came possible sterility with chemo. 

00:32:40
ZOY KAZAN Alright. 

00:32:40
 So, we did that before I got. 

00:32:40
ZOY KAZAN So that’s a safeguard for you if you want to have children. 

00:32:40
 Yeah, exactly. 

00:32:45
 Sitting in the lobby here and he just says, oh, by the way Tommy is safe for another year. Tell, little Tommy is safe for another year. 

00:32:50
ZOY KAZAN Is that because you have to pay something to… 

00:32:50
 They don't -- they're getting a big kick out of this. I don’t get it, I don’t. 

00:32:50
ZOY KAZAN So that’s very – that is very funny. You obviously have a really great sense of humor and fun. 

00:32:55
 It was very funny. 

00:33:00
 I am not making fun of you. 

00:33:00
 I know you’re not making fun here. 

00:33:00
 He was doing it very seriously. 

00:33:00
 I don’t see the humor and I don’t see there is that much humor. 

00:33:05
ZOY KAZAN And that’s for living. 

00:33:05
 Well. 

00:33:10
ZOY KAZAN It’s not like your… 

00:33:10
 You do have a good sense of humor mommy. 

00:33:10
ZOY KAZAN He still have you… 

00:33:10
 It’s coming back. 

00:33:10
 You do have a good sense… 

00:33:10
 It’s coming back. 

00:33:15
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:33:15
 It’s better. 

00:33:15
ZOY KAZAN Maybe it’s slowly creeping there. 

00:33:15
 It is. 

00:33:15
ZOY KAZAN Just slightly. 

00:33:15
 Yeah, it is. 

00:33:20
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, that’s great. 

00:33:20
Team comes in. 

00:33:20
  Well, I guess I am sitting with a sense of privilege that of listening to Hall, and Becky and Tommy and the sense of being invited into some of the important things that are going on in their lives. 

00:33:40
 I was touched by the family’s openness and the sincerity as they talked about their experiences and how they related to one another and what different things meant for them. And so, I really just initially, I really appreciated their willingness and openness to share that with us. 

00:34:00
 If I can just pick up on something specific that I was touched by and the family might have trouble hearing my accent. My name is Cathy and I am from New Zealand and I have just arrived in California. And when Tommy spoke at first of his hopes for the mating and he see it something like if I can help in any way I can, that’s what I am here for today. 

00:34:25
  Yeah. 

00:34:30
 And the tears just rolled up in my eyes when I heard that. And I guess, Becky and I are about the same age and Tommy and my son are probably the same age. And kind of having a sense of being, from me being connected with my family and, you know, what would the meaning for me as a mother of my son and the circumstances saying, if I can help my grownup son wanting to help me in any way he could. So that it was particularly powerful, you can see I went and got a Kleenex because I know I was – I was moved by that from the beginning and then I kept hearing ways in which this family, different members in the family, at different times it carried optimism. 

00:35:20
 Even though it’s been tough for them at times and no one is perfect, they haven’t given up. And I think that in life, I mean, maybe you don’t always see this as for life, but until they’ve given up, I mean, wow. 

00:35:40
 The last thing she said, before we finished was, they were talking about sense of humor and the sense that it’s coming back. 

00:35:50
 Yeah. 

00:35:50
 So it’s not a simple, one-way picture like the times when it kind of pulls away from that sense of hope or the sense of optimism or sense of humor. And times where they can sort of support each other because it was Tommy who was saying, you’ve always had that sense of humor mum. 

00:36:15
 It seemed like there has been a, the legacy has been passed on… 

00:36:20
 Yeah, from the mother. 

00:36:20
 From the grandmother to the mother and also I see it in now…. 

00:36:25
 In Tommy. 

00:36:25
 In Tommy. Right. 

00:36:30
 I mean, I can’t imagine… 

00:36:30
 And he sees it too. 

00:36:30
 Having to go through something and then have someone to support you like that. To be there for you, you know, to have that. I mean, that means a lot to have people that are there for you constantly. So… 

00:36:45
 And I think what we heard Ms. Becky talking about accumulation of having one after another a series of things that, you know, have worn her down, worn down that seeds of hope. That sense of being, you know, it seems like her maybe, you know, the capacity for always, you know, being the mother who got up for always managing us is like for now, that’s really hard for her to do in the ways that she has always done. And I guess, again I just want to honor that. But at the same time, hearing what Tommy said is, when Becky was talking about her own mother giving incredible support and her zeal for living and Tommy saying, she is still that way with her grandchildren. You know, and that… 

00:37:45
 It’s still there. It hasn’t, yeah. 

00:37:45
 Although it’s difficult, those things for Tommy are still counting, even if for Becky right now or not there are other people who are valuing the aspects of lives capacities that are still there. 

00:38:05
 So has is, as Hall talked about his optimism, it’s kind of like he helps carry that for her now. It seems almost like so that she can take the time to because it’s -- she talked about previous experiences and how sometimes she’d kind of lose that optimism just for a moment, but then it would come back. So it sounds like, Hall is now carrying that optimism so that she… 

00:38:30
 And Tommy is carrying some of it. 

00:38:30
 And Tommy is carrying it as well. 

00:38:35
 Yeah. 

00:38:35
 And so then, they were kind of giving her the chance or the opportunity to come back. And it sounds like it’s starting to – that optimism is starting to come back into her. By the end of this session she kind of, I think she said that it was creeping its way back in or something. 

00:38:50
 Yeah. 

00:38:50
 There was one point when Becky was talking about her experiences and what she did. And then Hall had put him arm, he touched her leg, then he put his arm around her to confirm and to let her know, yeah, hey, see, Tommy realizes what you did when he was small and what you’ve been doing for him and the rest of the family throughout the years. And just it moved me their, their attachment to each other and the connectedness that they had… 

00:39:25
 There is a connection there. 

00:39:25
 Yeah. 

00:39:25
 I was sort of hearing what you said about strength and also about optimism and Hall shared around and carried around in the family. And I was thinking about how sometimes I can feel disconnected even from strengths that at other times that I would know that I had. 

00:39:40
 And like you said, I think sometimes you almost just have to honor or accept that… 

00:39:50
 Yes. 

00:39:50
 That overwhelmed. 

00:39:50
 Yeah. 

00:39:50
 I don’t know if you always have to do more than that. But sometimes… 

00:39:55
 That might be an important piece… 

00:39:55
 To the puzzle. 

00:40:00
 Yeah. When they were talking about Becky’s mother, Zoy asked, was she an optimistic person and Becky laughed and said, nauseatingly so. 

00:40:10
 You know, what were you hearing in there? 

00:40:10
 Well, I guess the… 

00:40:15
 You know. 

00:40:15
 Her sense that, you know, it was wonderful on the one hand. And at the other time – other hand, you can’t always be optimistic. I wonder what her private experience might have been even though she was giving out optimism, whether they were places privately that, that’s what I was imagining. I don’t know, I am just speculating here. 

00:40:35
 Yes, yes, yes. 

00:40:35
 She said something that really touched me, when she was talking about, how she saw her relationship with Hall right now is going further apart. 

00:40:45
 Yeah. 

00:40:45
 And she said something that, she, I think she actually said, like, that she was envisioning a real life together with him. 

00:40:55
 What she also said in there. We have no real life together. Now, I was curious about what her vision was of a real life together. 

00:41:00
 I was wondering what that would look like. 

00:41:05
 Yeah, and it seemed to be attached to retirement. But I am wondering whether it’s also attached to where they are living right now in their lives. 

00:41:10
 Maybe some of the pain for Becky now is the disruption of the interconnection is the ways in which you know the way in which the loss of optimism has distanced her from Hall and you know like so I guess I was interested too and that what she was asking for what. And what she wanted to restore in the relationship for what she would want more of that was different given the sense of disturbance to her. 

00:41:45
 I wonder what her mother would tell her about that. Her mother being so optimistic -- I wonder how her mother might be helpful for her and looking at some of those aspects of her future. 

00:42:00
ZOY KAZAN So just wondering what that experience was like for you and what comments if any you would like to make about that. Anyone can say. 

00:42:15
 Me first. 

00:42:15
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:42:15
 Well, three or four things. Well, clearly we need at least ten counselors every time we come. With the prospective as much big. I thought you guys are good enough, I mean, two is a blessing, but I, you know, this was good thing, there is so many different common perspectives. And I’ve been feeling frustration since I first came, because my kids, other kids couldn’t come because I feel like the family dynamic is not full if they’re not there, but they really. Christie’s lupus is really acting up and Annie is very, very sick. So, that was really frustrating for me, that our bigger picture couldn’t be seen. But that’s probably just my frustration and feeling, you know, we’re not really a family unless everybody is there for something like this. But as far as what my – the comment about my mother, my mother wouldn’t have talked. She just was as bubbly constant personality. So I probably never had ever one full complete thought ever fulfilled. She was just very hyper and there is a large amount of ADD I am certain in our family. And she would just go from one thing to the next, we could never finish. She would just instigate, and organize and move on and we never really. So it was always very frustrating really because we couldn’t complete a full complete thought. She will just, you know, it’s like we will just move on. You will just have to move on in that state of optimism. So the rest of our family, we’re not like that. The kids, she – that we didn’t even hear at that part from her. So and as far as, I think if I thought a lot more about you know, my baby is dying and my first husband is dying and the kids illnesses and things like that and Christie is having a baby out of wedlock or just as hard as any of the illnesses that I’ve gone through. I mean, all those things, so I took all those things personally. And for Tommy to even give a hint that he was doing this for us is just, I mean, just us sitting here, I am sure it’s as astounding for you as it is for us, because we never thought any of the kids really cared about doing anything because we thought they would approve. So clearly that might be changing as they’ve gotten older. 

00:44:25
ZOY KAZAN That’s a huge thing, isn’t it? 

00:44:25
 That’s a huge thing. 

00:44:25
ZOY KAZAN Was that the first time you heard that today? 

00:44:30
 Oh, yes. 

00:44:30
ZOY KAZAN Oh, that’s big. 

00:44:35
 And she needed to hear it, I am sure. 

00:44:35
 Yeah. Because I felt even as adults the children, no, that’s not true because I really didn’t care about pleasing my mother, but I guess I did, I mean, I did my own thing because I was very, very – I was hippie and I was very rebellious and I, no matter what she said, I did care, I was respectful, I listened to what she said, I just would still do my own thing. 

00:44:55
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:44:55
 So, I guess that’s kind of what you want with your children, but when they make bad choices, you don’t want to claim any of that, you just hope that when they make, you know, that they would make good choices. 

00:45:05
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:45:05
 And that they would give you the credit for it. 

00:45:10
ZOY KAZAN That’s a big ask, isn’t it? 

00:45:10
 That probably doesn’t make any sense. 

00:45:15
 Whole lot of the motivations of what I have now, what I am doing going to school and trying to get out as for them, so I’d not – they’re not obligated to take care of me anymore. So I can be out of my own again, they don’t have to stay there. One thing I wanted to say when, they talked about and I think this goes a lot for our family. I don’t – when I say, that it wasn’t hard for me to change or anything, it may be a bit hard, difficult, but I am not looking for recognition for her or anything. So I don’t – I guess, I am trying to be humble about it, but I think we’ve all been very humble and our successes that we try to – that we don’t, I mean, it’s always good to hear, you did well, but we don’t– we’re not always looking for it in what we do, so it’s kind of, it has a big deal with how we effect each other, how we interact with each other. 

00:46:00
 I am proud of you Tommy. 

00:46:05
 Thank. It helps. 

00:46:05
 Asked me to make sure it was related. The same Tommy that we always talked about. 

00:46:10
 That’s one thing that stuck out of my mind when they were talking. I think we’re all that way. We all… 

00:46:20
ZOY KAZAN You downplay the praise. 

00:46:20
 Yeah. I mean… 

00:46:20
ZOY KAZAN You don’t do it for praises. 

00:46:25
 We all, I know we’re always – yeah, we don’t always look for praise. But… 

00:46:25
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:46:25
 I think it’s, we do receive praise, but it’s not, I don’t think that’s our first priority. 

00:46:30
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:46:30
 I think it changes. 

00:46:35
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:46:35
 I think one of the things that I saw and probably more clearly than I’ve seen – didn’t have anything to do with therapy or anything. Just having I think other people is that, yeah, we’re survivors, and I tried, I’ve seen it, but I can’t – I am still trying to convince myself of it. But what are the – what are accomplishments, what level of accomplishment is important to me. I mean, I am feeling like my kids aren’t successful. But really when you think about all the illnesses and everything that we’ve gone through, I don’t like the one, say, he is a kid, because he was kid, but – or he is a kid, but I mean, what we’ve gone through really is huge. I mean… 

00:47:10
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:47:10
 Really are huge things for us to still be us, you know, just accepting of our illnesses and stuff when we could have succumb. I mean, one of my kids could have become drug addicts or gone off in any direction, serial killers or anything for the things or use them as excuses for that. So I think I have to just convince myself and I think that’s why I saw when the group was speaking, so I have to convince myself that, whatever accomplishments they have, it’s huge considering circumstances, what they’ve gone through. 

00:47:40
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:47:40
 So, even for Tommy to even try to do this. He is trying to figure out, how to have his hip replacement and still go to school, I mean, that’s, you know, I mean, I don’t think it’s very smart, but it’s incredible that he feels that way, because that really is the way we are. 

00:47:50
ZOY KAZAN But similar to you having a liver transplant… 

00:47:55
 Right, right. 

00:47:55
ZOY KAZAN And going on providing family time and acting as… 

00:48:00
 You’re right. 

00:48:00
 If it's no big deal. 

00:48:00
 Well, Hall graduated from college at 50. He was taking care of me because I was dying. And he was, so he was really having and he was taking the kids. I mean, he had really three jobs at that time, you know, trying to study. And he did it all at 50, so the kids have seen this from both of us, it’s not just me. 

00:48:20
ZOY KAZAN It’s amazing. 

00:48:20
 That 50 was just a couple of years ago right? 

00:48:20
 Yeah. 

00:48:20
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, two years ago. 

00:48:20
 When he got up on water skis at you. 

00:48:25
ZOY KAZAN At 50. 

00:48:25
 At 50. 

00:48:25
ZOY KAZAN I am impressed. I am impressed. I am just scared to do that. What did you think about the team Hall? 

00:48:35
 Well, they brought up two things that stuck in my mind. And number one, I guess, I got to apologize to Tommy for not listening more intently the, when he said that, you know, the comment that Becky remarked on it, that he was doing things for us, you know. And I am proud of that fact, and I am glad of that. The other thing was is that someone made the comment that where Becky is feeling down, and no hope, you know, that I was there to help, give her that hope. And I feel like I’ve been totally unsuccessful at that point. You know, I’ve not – if I’ve gained a yard, you know, I’d be surprised. 

00:49:20
ZOY KAZAN And I need to check something there. Because what I heard people say is that, hope is like a torch that you carry. You can’t give it to someone else, but you carry it almost alongside of them. 

00:49:35
 Yeah. And my thought was is that, in trying to either reignite that or do whatever I can, is just that, I don’t feel like I am accomplishing anything or nor if – we would have gotten a little smidgen of, I fought back in her life, you know, it just, I don’t feel like we’ve gotten there. And that’s difficult. That’s almost hopeless. 

00:50:00
ZOY KAZAN So that’s been like a goal for you to reignite the hope in Becky. 

00:50:05
 I would love to see it reignite in her because she is just a positive person and has been for so long. This year it go the opposite way, it has been very distressing. 

00:50:15
ZOY KAZAN What if you were to view it as, just a necessary time of – time out from hope, time out or a necessary interval. 

00:50:30
 I defended her in that respect to other people who question, why is Becky so down, and I go, you know, you can’t have – you can’t have lost your first child, you lose your husband, you have two kids with lupus and you’ve gone through a liver transplant, I just who wouldn’t feel down and adopts after so much. And I still feel that way. Becky has been through a lot. The kids have been through their fair share of stuff. And I just came along and kind of got hitched up to the wagon, you know, and ride along with this thing. So. 

00:51:00
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:51:00
 You know, and what this did, and we’re like – we’re back to square one. We’ll deal with it as it comes and make it work. Make the best of what we can. So this… 

00:51:05
ZOY KAZAN We’ll think about, yeah, we’ll think about the children of Israel they were in the desert for 40 years. 

00:51:10
 Yeah. 

00:51:10
ZOY KAZAN You know, and they did come back. They did get to the promised land, but it took them, they had a big detour through the desert. 

00:51:20
 Yeah, they did. 

00:51:20
 There is no way I am waiting 40 years. There is just no way, tomorrow. 

00:51:25
ZOY KAZAN Well, you know, these things take time. And you know, we have to degree, we have to experience sometimes, it takes a while for our feelings to catch up with all of the events that you’ve been through it. It doesn’t happen overnight. 

00:51:45
 Well, you know, unfortunately I'm kind of a right now person I guess and… 

00:51:45
 Both of us. Both of us. 

00:51:50
ZOY KAZAN You are what now? 

00:51:50
 We both, right now, right now. 

00:51:50
 Right now. We want things to happen now. 

00:51:55
 Let’s see it happen today. 

00:51:55
ZOY KAZAN Oh, yeah. 

00:51:55
 We'll make it happen. 

00:51:55
  You know real -- you know intectually, I realize that it’s not going to happen, you know, but it doesn’t stop my emotions from saying, I wish it was right now. 

00:52:00
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:52:05
 To see things change. 

00:52:05
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:52:05
 Because it’s difficult for all of us. So. 

00:52:05
ZOY KAZAN I hear you. 

00:52:10
 Well, my image of myself. He is – he’ll always be a hero, we’re going to clone him because we can probably make money on him. They don’t make him that way, but my image and my – I am not a hero or anything anymore because I did try to commit suicide twice last year. So to me anything that you’re talking about as far as you have to get through things, that’s one thing when you don’t try to end it. And it’s another thing when you’ve tried to end it. I mean, I don’t feel that way anymore, I don’t feel that depth. And I’ve even, I still think it’d be easier not to be alive, but that, I don’t think about suicide. So for me not to have – so I feel like I blown any image that I had with everybody. So it’s clear that that’s how -- you can’t fix that. That’s just the way it is. So that it kind of throws into the same lack of well. 

00:52:55
ZOY KAZAN So it sounds like the impact of those events on you have been for you to really see the relationships with your family as irretrievably damaged. 

00:53:10
 Probably. 

00:53:10
ZOY KAZAN As a result of that. 

00:53:10
 To some degree, yeah. 

00:53:15
ZOY KAZAN That’s how you see it. 

00:53:15
 I don’t think that’s true mom, you – because look, you don’t bring up all the things I do all the time. 

00:53:15
 No. 

00:53:15
 I mean, all that I’ve done in the past. I don’t think anyone in our family thought that way. 

00:53:20
 I see it as similar to trust. You know. 

00:53:25
 Yeah. 

00:53:25
 You may have taken, if you do something wrong and your parents you know lose trust in you, then you have to take time to rebuild that trust again. You just try to start doing things right. You know and I think that’s what Becky as far as that kind of, this kind of thing. 

00:53:45
 Yeah. 

00:53:45
 Yes, is it. She needs to just let the time work its way up because it’s not irreparably damaged. It won’t be forgotten easily, you know, but you know, when you show that you are doing all the right things and you’re doing the best that you can and you know, and we’re not considering those things again, which as she obviously has indicated, she is not, then there is success, you know. And to see it in the other way, I think it will be difficult. 

00:54:10
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, and I am hoping that you get a chance for more conversations about this with Ruthi and Sarah because I think sometimes we have to forgive ourselves for the things we’ve done. And that’s hard you know. But I wondered if you two have some comments about what this experience has been like for you in terms of your directions for therapy or your unawareness of the work you’re doing with the family. 

00:54:45
 For me it’s been really, really interesting and its then just really hope for, in terms of opening up more space. And also realizing that some of the things we might have done and then left, we need to go back to and spend more time with. I think one of the most troubling things is, that I really suffer with Becky when she blames herself and it’s so hard on herself when I see this family as rather heroic and amazingly loving and good people and having so many voices say that also, witness that and express that, but really supportive to the feelings I’ve had and that I wanted to get across. So that felt really, really good to have that happen today. 

00:55:35
 Yeah, I agree with that. It was nice, almost every comment that was made on the reflecting team where things that I thought about particularly how they have gone through transitions and transformations, each of them. And how at times their, they’ve experienced no hope before. And I think each of them and how they would think that things could never change before had changed, I mean, even with Tommy and his experience, you know, they had thought that, that would never change, but it did. 

00:56:10
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:56:10
 So just hearing some of those things, the history of the transformations is helpful for me. 

00:56:20
 I also loved having Tommy gave his mom and dad credit. And helping, you’re helping them know that what you do has to do with them and how they’ve loved you and raised you. That has to me very powerful. 

00:56:35
ZOY KAZAN One thing about reflecting teams is they really get us to, they really do open up the space for us to go to the next level and deal with what else is there. And I often noticed that families will say, their deepest concerns after they’ve heard a reflecting team. And I think that’s just type of now and I really appreciate that you did that. And I think it’s something that you could probably all participate in a ceremony to deal with I believe in rituals and I think as Christians you probably do too. 

00:57:10
 Well, I don’t think – the kids were always there for me. I think Tommy was most angry of the girls, you know, Annie is probably still caring more than anything. 

00:57:20
 Yeah. 

00:57:20
 She is the one that’s unaffected by the lupus or I mean, physically unaffected. She doesn’t have it, but I think emotionally it’s still the most, wouldn’t you say? 

00:57:30
 Yeah. 

00:57:30
 She is having, she gets anxiety attacks and things like that and she brought that out. And it did hurt and I could do nothing. I could do nothing, but just sit there. 

00:57:35
ZOY KAZAN We really appreciate the fact that you waited so long to see us. And you know we have own issues today we had to deal with, but thank you very much and… 

00:57:50
 Thank you. 

00:57:50
ZOY KAZAN I hope the tape is useful. And that Annie and… 

00:57:50
 Christie. 

00:57:50
ZOY KAZAN Christie get to see it. And… 

00:57:55
 We regret the fact that they couldn’t. 

00:57:55
 Yeah. 

00:57:55
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. It’s too bad, yeah. 

00:57:55
 You would really would have done something. 

00:58:00
 I could have convinced Christie, but she just didn’t feel well and she had to drive a stick shift and her joints are hurting. So it was little bit hard. 

00:58:05
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, that’s hard. 

00:58:05
 The irony is that I taught a stress and distress class and anxiety depression on Saturday. 

00:58:10
ZOY KAZAN Yeah. 

00:58:10
 For six hours. 

00:58:10
ZOY KAZAN It’s been total. 

00:58:10
 But I did tell them everything, but I at least was able to speak from some experience. 

00:58:15
ZOY KAZAN Exactly. And… 

00:58:15
 But at the same time I think there is something special about just having Tommy here too. 

00:58:20
 Yeah, I think so too. You know, because he doesn’t… 

00:58:25
 We debated about him coming initially because his sisters won’t going to come in and I thought. 

00:58:25
 Oh, certainly, yes. 

00:58:25
  We agreed together that it would probably be beneficial. 

00:58:30
 I am very glad. 

00:58:30
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, it’s been a pleasure to meet you all. Thank you. 

00:58:35
 Likewise, thank you very much.
