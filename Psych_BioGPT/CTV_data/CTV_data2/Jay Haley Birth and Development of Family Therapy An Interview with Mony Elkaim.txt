Jay Haley The Birth and Development of Family Therapy 

00:00:05
An Interview with Mony Elkaim, MD (1994) 

00:00:05
filmed by Madeleine Richeport-Haley edited by Madeleine Richeport-Haley & Jay Haley 

00:00:05
JAY HALEY (1923-2007) was known as one of the founders of the field of family therapy, strategic therapy, and brief therapy. His early work was in collaboration with some of the foremost thinkers of our time such as, Gregory Bateson and Milton H. Erickson, MD. He was a professor at Stanford University, Howard University, the University of Maryland, and the California School of Professional Psychology. He published more than 20 books and over a hundred papers. 

00:00:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD founder and president of the European Family Therapy Association (EFTA), and president of the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP). This interview was originally published in French in Resonances, Toulouse, France: Editions Systemes et Reseaux. (1995). 

00:00:05
"The 1950s, where everything happened" 

00:00:40
MONY ELKAIM, MD Before you arrived in Palo Alto, what were you doing then? 

00:00:40
Jay Haley 

00:00:50
JAY HALEY I was a theatre major in UCLA. Got a BA in the theatre and the last semester . . . 

00:00:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:00:55
JAY HALEY . . .someone posed the question, "Why do people go to the movies?" And there were about 50 million people who saw every movie in those days. Or one big popular one would have that big a draw, so there must be something pretty powerful to draw all those people. But I got interested in that just as I left UCLA. Then I went to New York, I wrote for a year. I sold a story in the New York, New Yorker so I thought I was going to be a great success. I didn't sell another one for five years. But I went to New York for a year and, uh, then I came back to California when my father died. And, uh, I had the problem of, uh, what to do to make a living and so I decided to go back to college as an English major. So I registered at Cal. And at Cal, University of California, they told me if I went to library school for nine months I could have a job. There were no librarians. So, I went for nine months, got a degree in librarianship and went down to Stanford and went into Mass Communication to get my degree, uh, my Masters. And while I was there I discovered that Gregory Bateson was one of the few people who ever examined a film. He studied a German propaganda film, Hitlerjunge Quex. So, I went over to see him, to talk to him about analyzing movies 'cuz that was what I was interested in. And he hired me on this project. We got in an argument really, about he didn't appreciate the edible, the castration conflict in his German film where there was a very significant knife, you know? And I was pretty Freudian then so I was correcting him. But apparently he liked it 'cuz he hired me. And he hired John Weakland at the same time who was studying Chinese films. So, all three of us were studying films really. But Bateson let me finish my Masters degree while working with him. And that's how I got involved with him. Uh, we started on just communication in general, paradox in communication. Primarily animal behavior in films at the beginning. 

00:03:10
MONY ELKAIM, MD It was in what year? 

00:03:10
JAY HALEY To the beginning of '53. Actually he, he hired me as a secretary. And, uh, paid me what I was be-, I was a reference librarian with Stanford by then and he paid me what they paid me at Stanford because he had this two-year grant. 

00:03:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Uh-huh. 

00:03:25
JAY HALEY And I had to decide whether to quit Stanford and go with him with a tenure of only two years or stay where I was and become a librarian and I went with him. And was with him for ten years with no tenure. We got a grant from year-to-year, two years. It was precarious. 

00:03:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD At that time, how old were you? 

00:03:50
JAY HALEY I was just 30 years old. 

00:03:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD What was it like working with Gregory Bateson and John Weakland at that time? 

00:03:55
Gregory Bateson 

00:03:55
Bateson Project 1955 

00:03:55
JAY HALEY It was a mixed, uh, a mixed bag, 'cuz Gregory, uh, was an extraordinary man. He's probably the, uh, was the major social thinkers, uh, in that decade. And he was his own form of deviant. You know he was never a professor. He was always a visiting professor. Nobody would hire him (inaudible ) and the University of California made him a regent which puts him in charge of the University on the board, but they wouldn't make him a professor. He had difficulties with anthropologists, because he thought differently than they did really. But as a, as a research director he was great. He, he posed us the problem of paradoxes in communication; that was his grant. And, uh, turned us loose really. Said we could study anything that interested us. 

00:04:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD And what interested you at that time? 

00:04:50
JAY HALEY Well, I started on films. And did a dissertation on a popular movie. Then I got interested in, uh, hypnosis. I met Erickson the same year; I took a seminar from him. And, uh, began to study hypnosis as a form of communication. And John Weakland joined me on that. And then, uh, in '54 I think it was, just within the year anyhow, I was talking to a psychiatric resident who said if you're interested in communication you should talk to this guy, uh, a patient. So I started talking to the patient. Actually, the resident was trying to find somebody to take him over, because he had to leave. So I started interviewing him and he was a word salad sort. He said he was from Mars. 

00:05:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm 

00:05:50
JAY HALEY That his, uh, his mother was - that his name was Margaret Truman or Margaret Stalin or somebody. But no one knew who he was. He'd been a state hospital; they picked him up walking down the street carrying a machete. His name was Earl. And they put him jail thinking he was drunk. And when they dried him out he didn't sober up. And he wouldn't say where he was from. He said he was born on Mars. And so they put him in the state hospital and he was there, god about ten years. And he mentioned an Army serial number. So for the heck of it they looked it up and there was a guy named Earl who had been in the Army for three months and was kicked out on a psychotic discharge. So they sent him over to the VA hospital, where I was, Veteran's Hospital. And I began to talk to him. And he had, uh, an interesting way of talking. And he had an extraordinary skill with words for a guy who had a third grade education. If - he was a migratory laborer is what he was. Working out in the fields when he was arrested, really. For example I asked him, "What's your mother like?" and he said, uh, "Skinny as a wolf, painted like a cat, with a long tail like a scorpion which stings." 

00:07:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD My god. 

00:07:15
JAY HALEY And that's a third grade education, you know? So he was intriguing in many ways. And I began to talk to, uh, Bateson about this guy and we began to lis-, record him and listen to him. And I was interested and Bateson got interested in, uh, in how we qualified things. That he had trouble framing something as being real or not real. And we got interested in that that problem. We started on a concern with perception. That could he perceive correctly or not? Which is the way people were thinking of schizophrenia then. Then we shifted more to how this was a communication to somebody else. It wasn't just his perception that it was a metaphor which he was creating. And that got us interested in, uh, the metaphors of schizophrenia. And we ran out of the, the first grant in '54 and we needed to raise some money so we applied for a grant to study schizophrenia from the point of view of communication and got the grant ; so had two more years. What happened is Bateson got a grant to study the paradoxes of communication. And the way he got it was there was a business man who was, uh, head of the Rockefeller Foundation. And Bateson went to talk to him about getting a grant and the guy said you got it. He immediately understood because he was in communication himself . 

00:09:00
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. 

00:09:00
JAY HALEY And so he gave the grant. And two years later when the grant ended, we hadn't accomplished much really . An- In terms of any real production. We were still fooling around trying to explore paradoxes. And Bateson went back to get it renewed this grant . And the man who gave it to him was no longer there at Rockefeller. So Bateson was sure he was going to be turned down. And he went there and he was turned down. And Norbert Weiner the cybernetician had been out to visit us, Bateson knew everybody . And Bateson wrote him a letter saying that schizophrenia is caused by a person being punished for expecting punishment. And he gave the example that parents will hit a kid and then when the kid sees him again he'll cringe and then the parents get angry at him because he's cringing as if he's going to be punished when he hasn't been punished you know, when he was expecting punishment. And I think Bateson went back there expecting to be punished by being turned down on this grant, and he was turned down. So we, uh, decided to write a grant on schizophrenia, and did. And got another two years with, uh, another foundation, I forgotten what. We were always with the smaller foundations we weren't exactly accepted by NIMH and those places. 

00:10:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Jay, you wrote an article in 1958 in which you insisted on the fact that double-bind was something which was not happening between the mother and the child, but was like two people caught in a revolving door, a situation in which you don't know who is pushing who, in which you don't know what comes first, the chicken or the egg. For me, that article was very important because, until then, people had talked about double-binds in terms of someone trapping, or binding, someone else. Did you have discussion with the whole group before you wrote that? 

00:11:05
JAY HALEY Well we were together eight hours a day for ten years and had endless discussions, so you can't tell where an idea came from really uh. We were into cybernetics and circular systems and it was becoming obvious that the parents were bound by the kid as much as the kid by the parents. The first family I saw it was, that was absolutely evident because the, uh, patient , the son, 43 years old, parents were in their 70s, what he did was send his mother a Mother's Day card saying, "You've always been like a mother to me." And the mother brought it into the session saying, "There's something wrong with this card", but obviously she was in some strange bind that he put her in saying, "You've been like a mother to me," you know? That takes some communication skill to do that. 

00:11:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD That's very interesting. So that's one of the first families you saw yourself? 

00:11:55
JAY HALEY Yeah. It was the first of the whole project so. 

00:12:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD So you were the one who was interested in Erickson and asked Bateson to take a look at Erickson's work, or did he know him before? 

00:12:10
JAY HALEY He knew him before. 

00:12:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD And he was a friend of his or not? 

00:12:15
JAY HALEY Bateson and Mead went to Bali and did a field trip for about three years in the villages and studied trance dances. So, they then consulted Erickson about trance and they showed him films of dances and asked him to say when did they, uh, person go into trance and what not. And they, uh, Erickson hypnotized his wife and had her estimated too on the theory that, uh, a person in the trance recognizes people in a trance more than when not in a trance. But, at any rate they got involved with each other at that time and Mead became quite a friend of the fam-, of the Erickson family. But that's when I asked Bateson if I could go take this seminar I didn't know he knew Erickson and what he said was, "I'll call him up and ask him." 

00:13:10
MONY ELKAIM, MD You know very well that there is this myth about the discussion, or the disagreement, between you and Bateson on the subject of power. Could you please tell me, was the argument important when you were on that project? 

00:13:25
Power 

00:13:30
JAY HALEY Well I had that interview with John Weakland and neither one of us can remember the issue ever being discussed with Bateson. In ten years he, uh, he never got unhappy about the way I was interested in power. I was writing papers which he was obviously approving because he was in the footnote, on control in therapy and so on. I think what happened is that ten years later after the project ended he was being pushed to agree that therapy was a good idea and that power was important in it and he didn't want that to be part of him. It, uh, but it-, the interesting thing to me was there were two major therapists who were the most power oriented people in the, the country. One was John Rosen who forced psychotics down on their knees and Bateson arranged we study him and enjoyed him immensely. The other one was Erickson who said it's best to take power and, uh, when you're doing therapy and Bateson was perfectly agreeable about that. So it never came up in the project. 

00:14:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD How did the discussion on power begin? 

00:14:55
JAY HALEY Well, uh, I think it came about after the project ended when Bateson really didn't like therapy and he didn't like psychiatry. And he didn't like hypnosis. And this project centered on those three areas because he gave us the freedom to go into anything we wanted and that's what we went into. And he, uh, consulted on it and arranged it and approved our going into it. So then when we started doing therapy Bateson didn't like to do therapy himself, he's an anthropologist . He doesn't believe you should change your data, you should just examine the data ; and in therapy you gotta change the data. You're trying to change people and you're trying to do it deliberately . 

00:15:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm 

00:15:45
JAY HALEY And he didn't like that. He didn't mind if someone else did it, but he didn't want to do it himself. So he would do a therapy where he would hope people would get better spontaneously or he would lecture them. But he wouldn't, he wouldn't, uh, do A to get them to do B, or do any manipulation of any kind. He I think he had been in Jungian therapy, and that had to be a big influence on him. 

00:16:10
MONY ELKAIM, MD Bateson saw patients himself, individually and in families? How was he with patients? 

00:16:15
Double-Bind 

00:16:20
JAY HALEY Well he had a group of alcoholics which he studied as being in (ph)acknowledges(ph) at the hospital he did therapy with and he was very dedicated to those guys. He'd go and bring them back to the hospital when they were found drunk out in the street . He was very concerned and a humane man with them . But he, uh, he didn't really do therapy with them in the sense of setting out to change them or , or an Erickson procedure where he might paradoxically do something with an alcoholic. Bateson would be as straightforward as he could and rational as he could. He, he had two kinds of patients . One set was these alcoholics the other was when we all started seeing, uh, we started seeing schizophrenics and did a survey of all the schizophrenics we could find and did a whole series of interviews on their first break. What flipped them out, really. But the-, one of the interesting things to me is the whole field at that time said that the past causes the present. And when we first, we he posed the double-bind it was a product of childhood experience, it was the past . And, uh, somehow we made the shift to arguing the schizophrenic behavior was adaptive and appropriate to the present. Which is what family therapy argues. That a person's symptoms are appropriate in the social situation. That's why you have to change the social situation. Bateson had no problem with that. He made that shift from childhood to current, current life with no problem . I think in maybe his anthropological background which is the current social situation makes the situation . 

00:18:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD So, Jay, you were also seeing families at that time. What interested you then in the families you were seeing? 

00:18:20
JAY HALEY (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:18:20
JAY HALEY There was a lot of new things all at once. 

00:18:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm 

00:18:25
JAY HALEY I saw my first family because they, this patient the 43 year old who sent his mother a Mother's Day card ; felt he, uh, couldn't leave the hospital unless he went home with his parents, he couldn't go somewhere else. And he couldn't stand being with his parents more than a five, about five minutes or he would fall down on the ground in the hospital. And they would call and an aide would come and take him back to the ward. And I was seeing him individually . And it seemed to me if he was going to go back home, he couldn't go back home if he was so scared he couldn't be with his parents five minutes. So I brought his parents in to see why he was so scared of them. And he stood up against the wall like Jesus and stayed in the room and we talked for an hour. And the parents talked about what a pain he was, or what a difficult kid he was. And they had been , he flipped out the first time when he was 20, in the Army . And when I picked him up he was 43, I think. So he been 20 years he had been in and out of hospitals with his parents trying to help him. And,,uh, I started, I even put a footnote on the paper about that, that this was not family therapy that it was a family examination, because we hadn't thought of family therapy. 

00:19:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. 

00:19:45
JAY HALEY And it was only after I started a series of interviews to prepare them to get him to go home that, uh, that everything changed in terms of our thinking about this a product of a family that can be done something to be able to change it . 

00:20:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD You generally work behind the one-way mirror and you supervise people. 

00:20:10
JAY HALEY (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:20:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD When did you begin to work primarily in that way? 

00:20:15
One-Way Mirror 

00:20:15
JAY HALEY The way the one-way mirror came into the field I think was there was a psychologist named Fulweiler . 

00:20:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD What's his name? 

00:20:25
Charles Fulweiler 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY Fulweiler. Charles Fulweiler. 

00:20:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Yes. 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY And he was over in Berkley and there was a, in San Leandro really, there was a Juvenile Hall. And, uh, what happened with him, he may be the earliest family therapist. Is he was, uh, seeing a young woman, teenage girl, who had run away from home and had been picked up in a bar out in the valley. And they brought her back and put her in the Juvenile Hall. And he tested her, he was a psychologist testing, teaching testing, and she came out with no neurotic problems in the testing so he thought it was just some fluke and set her forth again. And they discharged her. And in a few weeks she was picked up drunk in some bar out in the valley and she came back in again. And he again tested her and she was normal. And being a psychologist he was puzzled over how this could be. So he wondered for some reason what her home situation was like and he brought her parents in and he had a one-way mirror room because he was watching students test patients. 

00:21:35
MONY ELKAIM, MD I see. 

00:21:35
JAY HALEY And, uh, what he did was go behind the mirror and have the husband and wife come in the room with the daughter. And they hadn't seen the daughter for six weeks. And they were so casual and so cool. The father said, "How are you?" and the mother said, "Can you get cigarettes in this place?" and so. And Fulweiler was a very intense guy walked into the room, came out from behind the mirror and went into the room and said to the par - well he called the father out into the hall and he said, "Do you love your daughter?" And the father said, "Of course." And Fulweiler said, "You go in there and tell her so." So, the father went in there and Fulweiler went behind the mirror and watched. And the father struggled and finally uh, said to his daughter that he loved her. At that the daughter started to cry, the mother started to cry, the father started to cry, a big emotional session. So Fulweiler asked them to come back next week and do it again. And he began that arrangement where he put a family in the room he'd bring them out in the hall , talk to them and send them back in again and then he began to go in himself and be behind the mirror. 

00:22:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD When was it? 

00:22:45
JAY HALEY He, I discovered him in '57 and I think he would have said he was doing this from '53 or '54 on. 

00:22:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:22:55
JAY HALEY And when I heard about him, since we had never heard about family therapy anywhere else I went over to watch him. And I spent 30 sessions behind the mirror with him and I was so interested in that way of using the mirror, that you could see and still stay out of it, that when I went back I suggested we put up a mirror and we did. It's great for research to watch a family session. So, we put in a one-way mirror. So, then we got lots of visitors and they saw the one-way mirror and they thought that's the way you do family therapy; with a one-way mirror. So that's where it came from as far as I know. 

00:23:30
MONY ELKAIM, MD So when did you begin to see families behind the one-way mirror? In 1957? 

00:23:35
JAY HALEY Must have been '57. I went into practice in 1956 or so. And was in practice for oh seven or eight years. 

00:23:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:23:45
JAY HALEY And then got out of it 'cuz I was doing research all day long and practice in the evenings and weekends, you know? 

00:23:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD Too much. 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY And I was doing an Ericksonian therapy which was brief and a rapid turnover and crisis and things. And, uh, so that in the daytime we were seeing families of schizophrenics in the hospital and I was in a private practice seeing them in the evenings. So I saw them up until after the project ended really. I almost stayed in it to make a living. 

00:24:20
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:24:20
Founding the Family Process Journal 

00:24:20
Family Research Experiments 

00:24:20
Don Jackson, MD 

00:24:20
JAY HALEY But actually one of the reasons I wanted to start Family Process was because it might make an income for me so I could drop practice. And it never did make much income. '62 the project ended and I went over to do some experimenting with families with the Mental Research Institute which Jackson had just started. Jackson, by the way had a tremendous influence on our project. 

00:24:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:24:45
JAY HALEY So I went over, uh, to do some research and I wanted to be through with therapy. 

00:24:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:24:50
JAY HALEY I wanted to be able to study families without thinking about how to change them. 

00:24:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. 

00:24:55
Strategies of Psychotherapy (1963) 

00:24:55
JAY HALEY And that's very hard once you've been into it. 'cuz I couldn't see a family with an obese mother without thinking well I could do this and get her to lose weight this way. Instead of just this is a mother, you know? But then what happened is I wrote Strategies of Psychotherapy. And while I was trying to study families and get away from therapy that book began to produce people who wanted me to lecture and talk and discuss therapy, so I got back into therapy again. And then I began to teach a brief therapy course in Palo Alto. That was a product of that book really. 

00:25:30
MONY ELKAIM, MD In what year did you begin to teach brief therapy courses? 

00:25:35
JAY HALEY Musta been '63 or four. 

00:25:35
MONY ELKAIM, MD (crosstalk)'63. 

00:25:35
JAY HALEY When the book came out, '63. In '59 we got a grant from NIMH I think, to study, we got two grants. One was to study family therapy and John headed that one up; we had a two year grant. Then we had one to experiment with families and I headed that one up. So we divided at that point . 

00:26:00
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. 

00:26:00
JAY HALEY And that was, uh, oh '59, '60, '61 in there. 

00:26:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD When you think about the years you spent with Bateson... ...the years you went regularly to see Erickson... ...what are the first things that come to mind when you think about Bateson and Erickson and about Rosen? 

00:26:25
JAY HALEY Well Erickson was a deviant in psychiatry. And Bateson was a deviant in anthropology. Neither one of them went along with their profession when they disagreed with it. So, they tended to become isolates. We're similar in that way. But it meant that I was free to, to choose to think the way I pleased, because I didn't have to conform to a particular way. 

00:26:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:26:50
Alan Watts 

00:26:50
Zen as a model for therapy 

00:26:50
JAY HALEY And there was a real revolution in therapy at that time, up until the 1950s there was no directives in therapy. If you did a directive you were, uh, a cad really. If you told somebody what to do at all. And, uh, there was no behavior therapy, there was no family therapy. And one of the things that influenced me at that time was I met Alan Watts in '53. '53 was a busy year. I took a course from him on Western Psychiatry in Eastern Philosophy with John Weakland. And began to see that as a possible model for therapy. When you have a master whose job it is to change somebody. And they don't do it with just conversation or exploring the past, they do it in a variety of ways. So that began to appear like an alternative to psychodynamic therapy at that time. And that got into our project . 

00:27:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD So in fact, you never published together with Gregory Bateson, anything about all those years? 

00:27:55
JAY HALEY No and we should of, we talked about it. But by the end of the decade, ten years we'd have enough of each other really. I mean we'd been together eight hours a day for ten years. And dealing with highly charged material and controversial material and living on the edge of a grant all the time. 

00:28:20
MONY ELKAIM, MD Tell me. 

00:28:20
JAY HALEY We should have written a book. And instead what happened is Jackson and Watzlawick wrote the book Pragmatics. Which is a kind of summary of the project and it's not a good book and Bateson didn't like it. 

00:28:30
MONY ELKAIM, MD So tell me, why wasn't it a good book and why, according to you, didn't Bateson like it? 

00:28:35
JAY HALEY Bateson said, "They took 30 of my ideas and they got 'em wrong." It was just enough off so that you weren't quite in agreement with it. Because Watzlawick had never been in the project and Jackson was not a theoretician he was a clinician, you know? And very busy anyhow all the time so he didn't, actually a research assistant wr-, largely wrote that book. 

00:29:00
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:29:00
JAY HALEY Maybe, maybe Watson did quite a bit too, 'cuz he writes well. 

00:29:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD Still that book played an incredibly important role in the field of family therapy, especially in Europe for example, where for everyone, the systemic approach to therapy was through "Pragmatics". 

00:29:20
JAY HALEY Mmm hmm. 

00:29:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Do you think it played a less important role here? 

00:29:25
JAY HALEY Oh yeah. Well it went into academia , but it didn't get out in... there was no family therapy in academia it was in private institutes. I think you can talk to everybody about their problems for years and they won't change unless you do something . 

00:29:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD So, for example, reframing things in a way which makes people look at their predicament differently is not enough, you have to do something? 

00:29:50
Change is produced by a change in the social situation 

00:29:50
"Every message is both a report and a command" 

00:29:50
JAY HALEY No. Here's the... there were two or three contributions of family therapy. And one was the idea that up to that time your thoughts generated your behavior and if you wanted to change somebody you changed the way they perceived and thought and so on. With family therapy it was arguing your behavior organizes your thoughts and gives you ideas. And that therefore you have to arrange the situation if you want the person to have different ideas you have to arrange a different social situation. And that was a revolutionary idea and very hard for intellectuals, because they've always felt that they if could understand themselves they'd be different. There was also Bateson's classic statement that every message is a report and a command. 

00:30:35
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:30:35
JAY HALEY And therefore just refraining is not just a report about how they should be different it's a command, be different. 

00:30:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD How can we guarantee that we don't do it, even if we just say what we think? 

00:30:50
JAY HALEY You can't not communicate you see. 

00:30:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD You can't not also command in a way even if you don't want to. 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY That's right. Once you realize that you're going to communicate and command no matter what you do, then you notice things differently. That Carl Rogers who said he didn't give any directives, that he just reflected back, if you watch him reflecting on what a patient says, he chooses certain things to reflect. He doesn't reflect everything. So the patient then begins to deliver more and more of those things. 

00:31:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD I want to ask you for one more story. I remember once someone told me about something that happened to Don Jackson, and I want to check whether it was just a legend or if it really happened. Apparently, Don Jackson was told that there was a patient who thought he was a psychiatrist and the other person was a psychiatrist who was told that he would see a patient who thought he was a psychiatrist. They then put Jackson and the other guy together. Did it really happen? 

00:31:45
JAY HALEY Not like that. 

00:31:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Tell me the story. 

00:31:50
JAY HALEY Bateson had trouble with every time he tried to experiment. 

00:31:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:31:50
JAY HALEY He couldn't do an experiment successfully, 'cuz he was too much of an anthropologist I guess. But at any rate he had this idea; that schizophrenia was a confusion of communication about the relationship. 

00:32:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:32:10
JAY HALEY And therefore if you could set up a situation where two people had different premises about what the relationship was you might get schizophrenic behavior . 

00:32:20
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:32:20
JAY HALEY And therefore he invited Jackson to see a patient in the VA. And we had we had a ca-, I think it's filmed somewhere. One of the few times we filmed because it was so expensive. But he set up Jackson to see this patient and he told the patient that this other guy that's gonna come in is a patient who has the delusion that he's a psychiatrist. 

00:32:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Ah. Ah. 

00:32:45
JAY HALEY So he's gonna talk to you like a psychiatrist and you should be patient with him. And we wanted to film this. So Jackson came in the room and the patient came in the room and they knew each other. They had met. And Jackson didn't say anything thinking, well maybe the guy flipped out and was in the hospital, you know? It was, uh, a psychiatrist or some guy anyhow and wasn't a patient. And the other guy thought, my god, maybe Jackson flipped out, I mean. But the whole thing went down the drain. And Jackson - what's interesting about the tape, about the film, is Jackson turned him into a patient. In a very skillfully leading him on and pretty soon the guy was talking about his problems, you know? But that was the, that was what happened and every time Bateson set up an experiment like that it went off. Let me tell you about another experiment that he did. I don't think ever got written up, I'm sure it hasn't. We were interested in the idea that schizophrenics and their families talked like they just met each other . 

00:33:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:33:50
JAY HALEY They didn't talk like they had confidence in their relationship. 

00:33:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm . 

00:33:55
JAY HALEY It was sort of a get acquainted conversation, always, even though they'd been together for years. So we wanted to experiment and test this. The thought was, uh, that if we brought three strangers together of appropriate ages, like the ages of parents and of the age of a kid or daughter. Then when they got together and talked we could show that to another group and say, "Is this a family of a schizophrenic or not?" So it was, sounded like a very interesting idea. We got it all set up, we had the one-way mirror room in downtown Palo Alto that we were working with. And we had a camera and Keys was a poet, he was our camera man. And we had the camera all set up. And we had these people in different rooms. And they came together and the man and woman sat down and began to talk. And then the daughter came in and the man and woman were Caucasian and the daughter who came in was Pilipino. Which totally took out the chance that this was a family. And the, uh, guy was an anthropologist who had been to the Philippines. So he immediately started talking to her about the Philippines, like two strangers would. So the whole experiment went down the drain. What Erickson... what Bateson had done is send over to the nurses quarters a message that he'd like to have a nurse around 18 or 20 years old for an interview and they sent over a Pilipino. 

00:35:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD This is some kind of curse, each time he does an experiment...! 

00:35:25
JAY HALEY That's right I think it was. And I was running experimental program and he was always saying to me, "Do an experiment, get an experiment." I'd say, "Bateson I'd be happy to do whatever you can think of." 'cuz we were into a new whole era of how to experiment with relationships and not with perception, you know? And it was an interesting problem, but a very difficult one. 

00:35:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD So you describe Gregory Bateson as someone who was trying to understand what was happening in reality. He was someone who believed that there was something out there that we could find and use. 

00:36:05
JAY HALEY Well he was a nineteenth century philosopher in many ways. His father coined the terms genetics, you know? He was a biologist. And Bateson said he never met a person that without a Masters degree until he was 21 or something like that. It was a very intellectual family. And, uh, a sad one in some ways, but very intellectual. 

00:36:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD So now the project is finished in Palo Alto; what happened then? 

00:36:35
JAY HALEY That was '62. 

00:36:35
MONY ELKAIM, MD '62, yes. 

00:36:35
JAY HALEY I went over to the MRI, the Mental Research Institute with Jackson. 

00:36:40
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:36:40
JAY HALEY Jackson, by the way had written a paper on family homeostasis which was systems theory. It came out in '57 and he said he wrote it in '53 or four so he'd written it a couple of years... it took a long time to come out. Back then a '58 paper of mine took three years to come out . 

00:37:00
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:37:00
JAY HALEY And that, I was writing that one when I was writing double-bind paper as a matter of fact, yeah. I sent it to journals, I waited six months, they'd send it back, want some revision, I'd send it back and this went on and on. But anyhow, Jackson was, uh, very astute about relationships he was personally supervised by Solomon. Who used to make an issue of how the therapists in the room as well as patient, and them influencing the patient by whatever he does, was Solomon's idea. He would always ask the therapists, "What were you were doing when the patient did such and such?" And the analysts in those days didn't like the idea they were having any influence on the production of a patient. 

00:37:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:37:45
Can you differentiate the family of a schizophrenic through measurements? 

00:37:45
JAY HALEY But anyhow, I was supervised by Jackson and that was his emphasis; that anything anyone was doing in that family or that individual was a product of what I was doing as well. And that I wasn't a neutral observer. And he, uh, had a nice ability to predict in fact, he was one of the best clinicians I've ever seen. He was curing schizophrenics routinely with their families. And he thought that wasn't much really, I mean he wanted to be a great researcher. He didn't want to be a clinician really. And it's a shame that we didn't get more films of him at work. We had some audio tapes, because we thought he'd live forever, you know? But anyhow, he was a big influence. But then I, he arranged a grant for me, he was always hustling money to keep his Mental Research Institute going. And there was an old church there and he got me a space in the church and I began a whole series of communication experiments comparing normal families, schizophrenic families, delinquent families, in tasks in which we were, uh, trying to get a measure of... the question was, is still an obvious one; If schizophrenia is a product of the family, can you differentiate a family of a schizophrenic from another family on the basis on any kind of measurements? And that's what we were struggling with them. I wrote about four or five papers on that and was beginning to get the hang of it, when we, I spent five years doing that. And I had Alex Bavales, a great social psychologist as my consultant on experiments. And it was, uh, an interesting time. The, uh, the money ran out and I couldn't get any grant from NMIH and Jackson couldn't. So what I had was an ongoing laboratory where I had a social worker whose job was just to bring in normal families and that's hard to get in, with teenagers particularly. And then I was trading talks at all the state hospitals around for abnormal families and made a portable testing thing to go test them. So that was the first experimenting with families, really. I don't know if it's even being done anymore. Hopefully it got into the universities. 

00:40:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD For four or five years you were working at MRI with Don Jackson? 

00:40:10
JAY HALEY Right. From '62 to '67. 

00:40:10
MONY ELKAIM, MD What do you remember about the four or five years with him that was important to you? 

00:40:20
JAY HALEY The idea of experimentation was the most important idea. How do you measure if you have a husband and wife relating to each other and another husband and wife relating to each other, how can you make a test that shows how they're similar or different. Not in their perception of each other, but the way they handle conflict, or the way they reach agreement. It was an interesting, uh, task. And it still is. But that was the main thing. Also, I was in, uh, practice a good part of that time and still being, still consulting with Erickson who was supervising in his own way, my work. 

00:41:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD How was Erickson supervising your work? 

00:41:05
Conversations with Milton H. Erickson, MD 

00:41:10
JAY HALEY Well he did various things. I'd ask him about a case and sometimes he would tell me something to do with it. More often he would start talking about one of his own cases and go off. But I'll give you an example. He, uh, I was just writing a paper remembering this. I was seeing a couple and the wife was very unhappy with the husband who was kind of a passive guy. And they both worked. And on Saturday mornings she would vacuum the whole house. 

00:41:40
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:41:40
JAY HALEY And he would come and walk behind her. 

00:41:40
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm . 

00:41:45
JAY HALEY From room to room to room. She said this was a minor problem, but it was driving her out of her mind. She couldn't stop her husband. And she'd say, "Don't follow me around the house." And he would say, "Yes dear", and then he'd follow her around the house. So I said to Erickson, "What would you do with this?" And he said, "The answer's obvious." So I said, "What would you do?" And he said, "Well you would tell the wife to vacuum from room to room and the husband will follow her and she's to go around to all the rooms where she vacuums. Then she's to take the bag of dirt from the vacuum and dump a pile of dirt in each room. And then she's to say, "Well that's done", and leave it there until the next Saturday. And he won't follow her again." So I did it. And he didn't follow her again. And I when I asked him, "Why, why will that work?" He said, "People can't stand absurdity. And that's just too absurd, he can't, he can't take it so he'll go away from it." 

00:42:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD When did you write "Techniques of Family Therapy"? 

00:42:50
JAY HALEY That musta been '66 or seven, I'm not sure. 

00:42:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD Why isn't Nathan Ackerman in that book? 

00:43:00
JAY HALEY Well I never thought of him as a therapist. 

00:43:00
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:43:00
JAY HALEY I thought of him as a family diagnostician. But also I was having trouble with him. If you ask him how do you change somebody, he wouldn't have an answer. He would say, "Well, I'd get together with them and I'd talk to them." And he was a very skillful interviewer. I'd been in to watch him interview, because I was watching therapists in those days. And he's got a nice film or two. I mean, skillful in this sense, that, uh, he, he saw family with a crazy patient of some kind and the guy had a brother in the room. And the brother said that, "I think this whole thing is a waste of time." And Ackerman turned to him and said, "I think you're very sharp about these things, I think you should be my co-therapist." Within seconds this guy was disarmed and cooperating, you know? That's what I mean, by skillful interviewer. 

00:43:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. 

00:43:50
JAY HALEY And he brought out the dynamics of families, but he also brought out all the negative stuff that the psychodynamics bring out. Which then made it very difficult to then get the family to do something, you know? 

00:44:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD When you think back to that time in the '60s, who would you say were people who were important for the field of family therapy? 

00:44:10
Organized Don Jackson, MD Memorial Conference in 1969 

00:44:10
JAY HALEY Well you know when Jackson died I organized an honorary meeting for him. And there were 45 people from all over the country and that's about all there was. Everybody who had any connection with the family I brought to that meeting. It was at a cinema in California. I still have got the audio tapes of that. And I've never published them, done anything with 'em. I was listening to one the other day to make sure it had something on it. But it would be interesting because that's where everybody was fixed about 1967 or eight, you know? 

00:44:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD Tell me, what happened to Jackson at the end of his life? 

00:44:50
JAY HALEY Well a variety of things happened I gather. He divorced his wife, took up with a girlfriend and I left about that time and that was a blow to him because he and I were attached. And I used to help him through some hard times. But he also started taking a variety of pills. And, um, he was found in a hotel room, he just back from a workshop. And, uh, he died of an overdose of Pentothal. And it looks like he was taking it to sleep. And one of the things that, uh, you do with that apparently is sometimes you take it and forget you took it. And I think that's what happened, because I went back there and spent a week talking to people about it and the way he had his life organized it didn't sound like he was going to withdraw and do himself in. He was so busy and had things so scheduled. And I'd been through some crisis with him before and he never withdrew and got depressed. What he did was get more active, and busier and busier when he got upset. But he was a very busy fellow. I remember, uh, once counting 12 projects he was involved with and those were the only ones I knew. I mean he was writing a book on the stock market with a guy. He was getting, uh, this kind of grant and that kind of grant. He was writing a book on, uh, on cases. And he was hustling money uh, to keep that place going. 

00:46:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD But he wasn't sick? 

00:46:25
JAY HALEY He wasn't sick, no . 

00:46:30
MONY ELKAIM And according to you, it was an accident. 

00:46:30
JAY HALEY I think could have been. At least it, it would be a mystery to me why he would kill himself even though he had a lot of troubles it isn't the way he worked. 

00:46:40
MONY ELKAIM, MD But was he having some trouble at the MRI at the time or not? 

00:46:45
JAY HALEY He had trouble with everybody there probably. Because what he would do, is he would get something started and then he would pass it on with them. And then he would get something else started, but he'd neglect what he passed on because he'd expect them to take care of it. And often they didn't, they just got exasperated with him. And the place had no money. It was really, uh, uh, a way of people in using private practice to make a living and getting research grants on the side. He couldn't get enough money for the place to make it a research endeavor really. And so he had to settle for whoever would come. It was a hard time getting it going . 

00:47:30
MONY ELKAIM, MD So at that time, at the MRI, who was there? 

00:47:35
JAY HALEY It was Jules Riskin, John Weakland after the Bateson grant ended went away for a year or so, then he came to the MRI, so he was there. Watzlawick was there. Virginia Satir was in and out of there. 

00:47:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD How was your relationship with Satir? 

00:47:55
JAY HALEY I enjoyed her. She was a formidable woman. A couple of things about her, she wanted to be a great theoretician. 

00:48:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

00:48:05
JAY HALEY And she was not a theoretician. And, uh, one day she said Bateson, John, Gregory and I that she had solved, theoretically, the whole family issue. And she would like us to come and listen to it. And she had a room with a big blackboard in the MRI there. So we came over and we listened. And it absolute balderdash; I can't even remember what she said. And Bateson said, "Well, that's interesting," and he left. And John left. And, uh, Virginia said to me something like, uh, "I don't why they didn't appreciate this." And I said, "Virginia it isn't what you thought it was. It's really just not good, it's awful." And she put her face right up in front of mine and she said, "Jay, I don't understand your love messages." But she was somebody who everywhere, we would all go around and talk about family therapy and people found it interesting. When she went around they started doing it. And she turned on people all over the country in family-- she probably had more influence than anybody else. Then she was on the road all the time. She once told me she was air 300 days of the year or something like that towards the end. 

00:49:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Let's talk about the moment when Sal Minuchin came to Palo Alto to see you and invite you to work with him. How was it? 

00:49:35
The Philadelphia Years 

00:49:35
Working with Salvador Minuchin and Braulio Montalvo. 

00:49:35
JAY HALEY Well an unusual thing happened with that. He called and said he wanted to see me. And I said, "Well why don't you stay at my house while you're here?" And he said okay. And I'd never invited any visitors to stay at my house really. So it, uh, he just appealed to me in some way. And he came and offered me a job and I didn't know he was going to do that. I just thought he was visiting, he used to travel around watching people too. I'd seen him at Wiltwyck in New York. And I'd been behind the mirror with him and Braulio. There was an interesting difference there. Which a guy who was there who told me he remembered; they had a mother and two kids and a grandmother. Black kids, they were delinquent kids. And they were, uh, bringing them behind the mirror, the grandmother, and taking them back in the room and the mother out. And they were interpreting to them to the boys about their mother and so on and about their relationship with grandmother. And the mother had no front teeth and she talked with her hand like this, covering the gap in her teeth. And there was a very shy looking woman. So they were busy doing, I guess a kind of interruptive structural type therapy. And one day the session ended, they asked me what I would do with that. And I said that I would ask the boys to, uh, get a bridge for their mother's front teeth. And that they should raise the money to do that and they shouldn't steal it and that should be their project because the mother would be a lot happier. Obviously she's shy about not having front teeth. And they thought that was crazy. I was neglecting the whole family structure, you know, and what was happening and exciting things with these delinquent kids. But, I'm sure those kids would have done it and I don't think they'd have stolen to do it, you know? But it's strictly an Erickson view. And that's what I pointed out, this is what Erickson would do. He'd pick the issue, a, an issue, like the front teeth, organize the whole family around changing that, you know? So anyhow, I enjoyed Minuchin. And Braulio particularly, in New York; and then when he came out and hired me. Palo Alto didn't have any poor. It had a little token slum there really, and the whole world was changing in the '60s. And the poor were everywhere and there were some demonstrations and so on and so on. At the chance of getting a salary and going to Philadelphia where there were plenty of poor I took that, that opportunity. It, uh, also because I was trying to live, I was living from grant to grant and raising kids on it and, uh, it was harder and harder. I needed a salary is what I needed and Sal promised me that I could come there, get a salary and not have to do anything I didn't want to. So that was great. And I, the first couple of years I did whatever the hell I wanted. I did some research with kids there and so on. And finally Sal said you know you have to do something, and I began to teach there . 

00:52:50
MONY ELKAIM, MD It's interesting, because in fact Sal did with you what Gregory Bateson did with you. 

00:52:55
JAY HALEY Leave me free yes. 

00:52:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD Yes. 

00:52:55
JAY HALEY Absolutely yes. 

00:52:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD Both of them, and you chose what you enjoyed. 

00:53:00
JAY HALEY I had ten years of that with Bateson to do whatever I wanted really. 

00:53:05
MONY ELKAIM, MD So how long did you remain with Sal Minuchin in Philadelphia? 

00:53:10
JAY HALEY It was nine years I think, ten years . 

00:53:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD Can you tell me a little about those years? 

00:53:15
JAY HALEY Well there were extraordinary changes. When I went there Sal had just taken over the Child Guidance Clinic. And, uh, actually, he didn't have his medical degree. He had a foreign one, Argentinian, and it wasn't accepted in the states. And he couldn't run this clinic unless he got it. And he said he wasn't about to go study and take tests. So the legisl-, they were so eager to get him that the legislator passed an honorary degree or whatever so that he could, he could practice. And he took over that clinic and turned it from a, it was a neighborhood clinic in a black neighborhood because it was the maid's neighborhood and it drew all the rich people from the suburbs to the clinic and not the local people at all, not the neighborhood. He turned it into a neighborhood clinic. He turned it into family orientation and he lost 95% of his staff, they just were gone. 

00:54:20
MONY ELKAIM, MD Why did they leave? 

00:54:20
JAY HALEY Hmm? 

00:54:20
MONY ELKAIM, MD Why did they leave? 

00:54:20
JAY HALEY They couldn't tolerate the changes. They didn't know how to work with families, and they didn't really want to work with families, and they were against the whole idea. And just like child psychiatry places are today really. But Sal, looked on it as a positive thing. He said it gave him a chance to get new people. But that's why he went and got me, was because he needed somebody connected with the families, and, uh, he was lonely really too. But what he did then, when I got there, there were 12 people on the staff and they sat around a table and talked about a case. When I left nine years later there were 300 and there were two satellite clinics besides the big clinic and it had all moved onto the campus and all. So he made tremendous changes. And he did the same thing Jackson did. He would start a project and then he would pass it to somebody else and start another one. That's how he kept that place financed. And usually passed them to Braulio. Then Braulio had to finish it. And fortunately was competent doing it. Which Jackson didn't have somebody who was competent who took them over, you know? 

00:55:35
MONY ELKAIM, MD My dear Jay, let's talk about the work you were doing with Sal. When you came to Wiltwyck, he was surprised to see you propose an idea which was an Ericksonian idea about the bridge for the mother. How did you succeed in connecting his structural approach with your strategic one? 

00:56:00
Giving Teens Cameras 

00:56:00
JAY HALEY Well I didn't. The first couple of years I filmed young people, young blacks, young whites doing different things. I was, I was interested in research idea that you teach them how to use a camera and then let them shoot whatever they want, and then you see how they see the world. And it was some interesting stuff came out of those kids. For example, the black kids filmed each other dancing or fighting or stealing or whatever. The middle class black and the, the white middle class filmed the corner of a building or a tree or a house, no people were in their films at all. It was curious. And that was independent of race, you know? It was middle class born. The poor whites danced and filmed themselves dancing. But anyhow, I was interested in that sort of thing and, and getting trying to film relationships and the rules for them. And then I had to begin to teach because Sal needed me, he was getting more staff that had to be taught and he wanted me to earn my money more. So I began to teach and I realized quickly I couldn't teach an Ericksonian approach in that setting. Partly because uh, of Sal interestingly enough. Like he was not, he didn't like anything paradoxical or anything manipulative or anything indirect really. And he would go along with it, but reluctantly. And the problem was, there were guys applying for child psychology to train with me who wanted that. So I would do things on the side with them, but the main bulk of the teaching I would do a structural kind of family therapy, you know? And then I started a sample of schizophrenics. We had no schizophrenics in the clinic because it, the age limit was 18 and most of them were older. So I did it in the evenings. I did 25 cases or something like that, with anybody who would bring in the family. But I did things on the side really, while the central stuff was what Sal or Braulio would do. Braulio was interested in Erickson, learned hypnosis. And, uh, was more flexible. Sal was partly feeling that, I think, Braulio and I were against him . 

00:58:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Some people will try to use your two approaches, the structural one and the strategic one, at the same time without seeing any opposition. But at that time it wasn't that easy? 

00:58:35
JAY HALEY No. It still isn't that easy. I mean I think still supervisors are, I've been writing a book on supervision and looking at what's happening in it and there's still the way they were trained in psychodynamic, non-directive approaches and they've got students out in the field who are telling people what to do and don't know how to do it, you know? 

00:58:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD So tell me, at that time you were training para-professionals, people from the street, people who hadn't finished high school, I suppose. 

00:59:05
Training the Poor to be Therapists 

00:59:05
JAY HALEY No, they'd finished high school. No it wasn't quite like that. Here's what happened. I got interested in the idea of a mother of a schizophrenic treating another family of a schizophrenic because they were so sharp and they were experienced. And I thought that if I can cure the family of the schizophrenic, I'll ask the mother to cure another one. Sal was interested in working with the poor, getting the mothers to change the way they dealt with the kids and then having those mothers change other mothers. So we came together talking about this idea, really. And the original idea was to train mothers. Or fathers, but mostly they were mothers. And Sal applied for a grant and in the process of making it a grant it became people who, uh, were poor to treat the poor rather than people who were experienced in therapy as patients. So we then began to interview people. And it was an interesting problem. It was gonna mean if, if you picked somebody you were going to train them 40 hours a week for a year, two years. So it meant you were going to put 100,000 dollars into this person and you had to decide whether they were a person you would want to train that much. And so we interviewed a whole sample of people. And the women were easy. They were very competent women. The men if they would settle for the stipend we could offer, they hadn't succeeded much in life. And they were pretty, uh, unsuccessful guys. Also we had women who'd bring their husbands in and say, "Here's one," and he would say, "Where am I?" But we required as I remember that they had a high school education. 

01:01:00
MONY ELKAIM, MD And did you enjoy that work? 

01:01:00
JAY HALEY Oh I enjoyed it immensely. I think that may be where live supervision really came in. In Palo Alto I had done supervision of people with schizophrenic families, staying behind the mirror and watching them and then talking about the session afterwards, but we didn't intrude. We didn't knock on the door or call in. Then the next step we began to knock on the door and to bring them out and influence them during the session, which was a remarkable idea. When we got to the poor we had to protect the families from total novices. And therefore we used live supervision very much. We planned the session with them, we put them in there, we called them on the phone, we called them out, we coached them, we sent them back. And uh, it was a very hands-on supervision and the teaching was, it was, well for example we had a group, 10 or 15 or whatever they were. And the first day we had 'em for eight hours and I taught for eight hours. The next day we had them for eight hours and I taught for eight hours. The third day I'd taught everything I knew. And, uh, and that's why we began to put them in with families pretty fast because that was before we trained people for a couple of hours or half a day or something. But this was... and we brought in more people to train. It was really just consuming us. 

01:02:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD At that time, I was working in Bronx State Hospital 

01:02:30
JAY HALEY Right. 

01:02:30
MONY ELKAIM, MD and I was training para-professionals. So in fact, a lot of them will fall back on your tools each time they get stuck, using the structural approach or the strategic approach. You didn't call strategic at that time. 

01:02:45
Problem-Solving Therapy (1976) 

01:02:45
JAY HALEY I don't know what it was called. But, one of the, um, one of the things I did in Problem-Solving Therapy was write a chapter on how to do a first interview in families and it came out of that work, because they needed how to know how do I sit, and where do I stand, and what if they kid is over there. And, uh, that has turned out to be very helpful for a lot of people just doing a very competent interview. One of the things that had an influence on me later, was, uh, training people who were not educated to be therapists. And it makes you realize how therapy was born in the university. And intellectuals love to think about themselves and wonder why people do and explain things. Instead of just take some action to make a change. 

01:03:35
MONY ELKAIM, MD Mmm hmm. 

01:03:35
Uncommon Therapy (1973) 

01:03:35
JAY HALEY And I think uh, once you've, you've trained people who aren't intellectuals you then look at the intellectuals in a different way. Oh I was writing at the time yeah. I was finishing up Uncommon Therapy then. 

01:03:55
MONY ELKAIM, MD So you worked with Sal for nine years, then Sal stopped, and you stopped. Why? 

01:04:00
JAY HALEY I stopped just before Sal did. Well the place was getting so big and, uh, and I was getting more interested in doing my own kind of therapy in my own kind of training really. And, uh, well I think I began to think I'd like to have my own institute so I could do it my own way. And I had met Col? so I'd began to come down here to start an institute with her and I commuted for a while and then moved down. 

01:04:30
MONY ELKAIM, MD So when you left, Sal left also. 

01:04:35
JAY HALEY He probably did. Well it was just so big I mean, 300 people and an inpatient unit. And you're into the confusion. I tried to get Sal to keep the old building and just have training there and let everybody else go over there with the new building and he couldn't do it because they were supposed to have to sell that to pay for the new one. But I just drove by the old one and it's sitting there and the windows caved in, trees growing out of the front door. It's just an abandoned building. It was an extraordinary building with one-way mirror rooms, it was very nice . 

01:05:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD So then you came to Chevy Chase. 

01:05:15
Washington, D.C. 

01:05:15
JAY HALEY What we did was get a room down, uh, there's a building on Connecticut, 3000 Connecticut, that's full of psychiatrists really and therapists. And we got a room there, knocked a hole in the wall, put a one-way mirror in and had a little waiting room and that was where we started. And we started with me giving courses that people came to and then would register for more training. And, uh, actually the first group of trainees, there were about eight or ten of them, all became our supervisors later. It was an interesting first group. And, uh, then we moved to Chevy Chase where we got a house and had three floors and that got so busy. We had a state grant to train everybody in Maryland really. And uh, we would have three families going at once and run up and down stairs, and we had eight/ten supervisors it was so busy. And, uh, you know I went over and visited, uh, Milan at about that time. And they had it so leisurely. They had one case that they'd talk about in the morning and discuss for a couple of hours, and then go to lunch and come back and talk about it in the afternoon. And I thought it was crazy of me to run up and down stairs with trainees you know? So we backed off and slowed down a great deal at that point . 

01:06:40
MONY ELKAIM, MD And now, are you still working with Clo?? 

01:06:40
JAY HALEY No, I left the institute. 

01:06:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD And what do you do now? 

01:06:45
JAY HALEY Just do workshops. A little supervision. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do yet. 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN Tell him about how the circle you really started with Bateson interest in Bali, and then you became interested in Bali. 

01:07:00
Produced Three Films on Balinese Trance and Dance of Children 

01:07:00
JAY HALEY Oh, that's right. We, uh, went over to Bali and spent three months there making films of Balinese dancers, the children dancing. And we went to the village where Bateson and Mead spent all their time and filmed some in there. So that was interesting. I'm writing a book on supervision called Strategies of Supervision, probably. And, uh, I do a workshop about every couple of months just to make a living really. 

01:07:30
MONY ELKAIM, MD Tell me, what do you think about all the constructivist movement? 

01:07:35
Multicultural Issues 

01:07:35
JAY HALEY I think it's back to the individual. It's an emphasis on how the person constructs reality or perceives reality or thinks about reality. There's no dyad in it. There's an inertia that takes people back to the individual again and again and again really. There's some reluctance. I think it's the supervisors holding up the field really from, from becoming more of a social orientation. But right now it's a curious situation. We have, uh, 180 ethnic groups coming in. We have every kind of psychopathology there is, we have all the court ordered cases with abuse and sex and physical and all kinds. And therapists are thrown in with these problems. And they don't know what to do. And they turn to a supervisor and the supervisor is teaching the way they taught 20 years ago. The way their teachers taught. And so they say, "I wonder why this is so upsetting to you?" you know? And if the person says, "I have this guy who never takes a bath how can I get him to take a bath?" The supervisor will say, "I wonder why you're concerned about that? Is there something about bathing that's personally important to you?" That is, they don't say, "There's three ways to get this guy to take a bath, you know, and you could try any one of these." Which is what I think the field needs more of and has been developing for several years. But the supervisors aren't there, you know? 

01:09:10
MONY ELKAIM, MD What do you think is interesting to say to readers who are family therapists working today in the field. 

01:09:20
JAY HALEY I think it's better not to call yourself a family therapist. It's better to be a therapist who takes the family into account, really. If you say you're a family therapist then you have to do it a certain way and there's wrong ways that you can deviate from the proper family therapy. You're into arguments, can you see an individual if you're seeing families and all those crazy things that happen with rules, you know? But I think there's a tremendous inertia to go back and as well as financial reasons to go into an individual long term way of thinking about therapy. But what's happening in this country now is, uh, the business matter of deciding how long therapy will be. The government, uh, and the people who don't know anything about therapy are making major decisions on, uh, how to pay for it and how long, so on. What you can do and what you can't do. You know one of the things we did in the '50s when we got into family therapy was stark wrong. We joined the patient against the parents. Bateson particularly attacked parents and was saving these patients from them. But all of us did that. And we also made interpretations and pointed things out to people that just upset them. It took a look while to get turned around and think in terms of hierarchy and to think in terms of a more positive way of guiding them so they prefer to go with you, you know? You can't separate who you're an agent of. I mean we used to be an agent of the individual. Then we were the agent of families. And now we're the agent of the state with court ordered cases. But it's a question of whether you're an agent of the husband or of the wife if you think that way too. 

01:11:15
MONY ELKAIM, MD Or you can think that you're an agent of change in that situation and that working for both of them. 

01:11:20
JAY HALEY That is if you can think in terms of all of them, that's right . 

01:11:25
MONY ELKAIM, MD Thank you very much, my dear Jay. Do you have some last wise things you'd like to say? 

01:11:30
JAY HALEY Last bits of wisdom? You know in terms of constructivism I think there's been a progress from the individual up to the '50s to the dyad through the '60s, and best represented by Erickson, to a triad where you think in terms of collations. And, uh, I think it's very hard to blend those. And the constructivists are not noticing who they're joining in the family against whom when they're focused on perception and how people perceive the world. But those steps I think have been the last few decades. But you know, there's another thing about Europe that interests me. I think so much of Erickson and so much of some theory in this state is rural. It comes from the American Middle West really. That is, you would never hear Erickson quoting Rousseau or a European intellectual or something. He would talk about life on the farm and what happened on the farm or so on. 

01:12:45
MONY ELKAIM, MD I told you I had the impression that, as therapists, we use whatever we have, and I learned a lot from Ray Bradbury, who wrote the "Martian Chronicles", or Kafka, or Borges, and they are part of my life and part of my work. Kafka was someone who spoke about the absurdity of life. 

01:13:10
JAY HALEY I was just saying it makes therapists more tolerant; to have such mysteries and it's all right.
