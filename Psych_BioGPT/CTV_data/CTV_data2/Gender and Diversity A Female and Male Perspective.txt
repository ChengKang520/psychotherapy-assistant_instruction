MELBA VASQUEZ  It is my pleasure and incredible honor to introduce to you Dr. Pamela Trotman Reid, (laughing) who is a developmental psychologist, and she's a professor of Psychology and Education at the University of Michigan, and a research scientist at the University of Mich, Michigan Institute for Research on Women and Gender. She's been an educator for more than 25 years, formerly holding faculty positions at Howard University, the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and at the City University of New York Graduate School, where she also served as interim Provost and Vice-President for Academic Affairs. Her research has focused on gender and ethnic issues, particularly on the intersections of gender and race, as they impact African-American women and children. Dr. Reid has numerous publications in journals and books. Her programmatic grants have provided support and mentoring for African-American and Latino and Latina students to pursue Doctoral Education in Psychology, as well as the biomedical sciences. She has recently developed a school based program to encourage girls to pursue mathematics as a vehicle to addressing social issues. In addition to serving as an academic scholar, researcher, and administrator, she has held many elected positions within the American Psychological Association. Now get this, talk about pioneers, she was the first woman of color elected to serve on the APA Council of Representatives. The first woman of color to do that. (clapping) She was also the first woman of color elected as president of the Division 35 Psychology of Women. (clapping) In that role, she paved the way for many of us. She appointed me program chair of that uhm, when she was president of Division 35, and I was so honored, I had no idea how much work that was. She's a fellow of the American Psychological Association and she's been an invited speaker at national and international conferences, and a recipient of numerous awards, including being named among a hundred distinguished women in the Psychology of Women, Outstanding Professor by the Student Government Association of Ushe, UT, you know, I wanna say University of Texas, but it's University of Tennessee, ah, twice, the Distinguished Leadership award by the APA's Committee on Women in Psychology, and the Distinguished Publication Award from the American, ah, from the Association of Women in Psychology. We are thus very fortunate to have this very distinguished and credentialed Dr. Pamela Reid to speak to us today ah, and her talk is entitled "Unfolding Our Lives: Gender and Class in Multicultural Psychology." Please help me welcome. (laughing)

PAMELA TROTMAN REID  Thank you very much. I, I think ah, Melba is getting back at me for uhm, putting her on that ah, program committee to chair at that time, but I'm, I'm actually very honored and delighted to have been invited by Melba and the Multicultural ah, Conference Committee to address this exciting gathering of psychologists on the issues that have grounded much of my professional work. Uhm, I realize that this multicultural conference actually also provides me with the unique opportunity because there's so many organizations and groups coming together and people from all the sub areas of Psychology that for uhm, maybe the first time, I get to, to speak at the same time to those colleagues who have been doing research on gender issues, as well as those colleagues who've been doing research on multicultural issues. Of course, it's also a challenge to be the speaker after lunch. Uhm, and after uhm, a day and a half of fantastic uhm, panels and invited presentations, I feel that the task is to be informative and exciting and inspirational, but happily, I have a co-speaker, so I will leave ah, some of those for him ah, to do. Okay Michael? Ah, I selected the topic, "Unfolding Our Lives," as a reminder of the complexity we confront in our efforts to examine issues of gender and class, and to complicate our understanding of multicultural issues. But, let me just start out. I wanted to, at least put a, a face to the idea of ethnicity and gender, and I love this ah, photograph of a little girl who, she's from California. And in her math class, when she made a mistake, a first grader, the teacher had her licked the blackboard to clean off her mistake. Uhm, because when we, when we start to look at issues and the complexity, we have to realize that we're talking about people, not just abstract ideas. We really know that it's not possible to study one trait in isolation whether it's intelligence or generosity, athletic skill or musical talent. Everything has an environment, in which it's manifest. We know that everything must be considered in context, even in the physical sciences, for example. When chemists isolate an element, they proceed further to learn how it operates in conjunction with others, how it combines and interacts. How it's influenced by temperature and other conditions. So too, in psychology, we cannot study one trait without considering the person who possesses it. Neither is it possible to study one category of persons, women, poor people, African-Americans. We can't study these in isolation unless they truly live in isolation. Obviously, this is not the condition of, of most women and men. So I propose that we consider people as they live within a context, within a context, within a context. So if we were to examine African-American women, we would note that most African-American women have lives embedded within an African-American family. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:05
PAMELA TROTMAN REID  And that family is enmeshed within an African-American community. And that, is in, in itself, is embedded within the dominant culture, within the dominant white society. So to really comprehend the issues important and relevant to, to them, to African-American women, if we took them as an example, we cannot just examine them as though they alone control the key elements to their behavior. We must understand them and the important issues of their lives as they are manifest in context, how they combine and interact with oth, with others, across and within the variety of domains. And let me even complicate this furth, complicate this further by indicating that we have to look at these within the intersections of ethnicity, social class, and gender. If we do not look at complexity, if we do not examine the complexity of our lives, we will only explain and understand a part of this picture. Given my understanding of people in context, I found that it was really not possible for me to discuss only gender or only class or only ethnicity. Since my talk about gender could not be focused on using a single topic or issue, I decided instead to talk about and explain why this difficulty in locating issues within just one sub area is not just my problem. Uhm, in fact, I'd like to suggest that we should all be struggling with the question of how our science routinely requires us to make artificial separations and categorizations. We should all be concerned with, or at least recognized, that we may too readily accept designations as variables and believe that labels represent behavioral and even biological distinctions. My goal is for you to take away two basic ideas: that gender impinges on every aspect of psychological research including multicultural research and that gender may be considered an aspect of our culture, as much as our ethnicity is. Yet, I, yet, I have noticed that many multicultural studies do not adequately address the issue of gender any better than many women studies sufficiently account for cultural or ethnic variation. For more than two and a half decades, oh, it felt so long, (sighing) I've strongly suggested that there is a problem with our approach to multiculturalism and a parallel flaw in our approach to gender study and psychology. There's some parallels in each of these areas. We began with psychologist trying to assess what might be useful paradigms, what might be useful approaches to explaining apparent differences between the target group, ethnic minorities, or women, and the majority, the White male population. Uhm, we've also seen that women in ethnic minorities, the target group, was treated as insignificant and unimportant by the psychological mainstream. For advocates of each position, there has been a need to confront the dominance and often oppressive White middle-class male perspective. Thus necessarily, both conceptual and empirical analyses were initiated from a very defensive posture, resulting in theories of deprivation, explanations of diminished capacity, and models of inadequacy. We can consider how researchers have confronted implications of intellectual inferiority of people of color and similarly of white women. I really don't have, I'm trying to keep this on the table. I don't have time to give examples, but I will just let you think of them yourselves. Uhm, we can also consider that researchers have attempted to explain, alleged social ele, inadequacies of people of color and similarly of white females. Also, there's a similarity in how many within and outside of psychology believed in the biological or genetic deficiency of people of color and females, and, and they have all sorts of studies in evidence to justify these beliefs. Indeed, the similarities in the treatment of women in ethnic minorities in soc, in society and in psychology is remarkable, and we can match a number of experiences. Thus, we can note therefore, each psychological investigations have focused on the group's ah, marginal social status, the experience of oppression and discrimination, particularly in the workplace and in academic settings, and on the practice of overlooking and ignoring the group's needs, in psychological theory, research, and practice. Of course, while there are many parallels, there are also conflicts. These become most apparent when we move to the intersections, as when we examine or more often ignore women of color. In my research, I have noted that women of color are understudied, overlooked, and their perspective's ignored in psychology. Still, it seems necessary for us to understand the dual identity of those who manage the inter, the intertwined statuses of being women and ethnic minority. But it is been somewhat disappointing and distressing to find that those who examine race and ethnicity typically ignore issues of gender and the impact of sexism, so that the studies of ethnicity appear to exclude consideration of female perspectives. In the feminist literature, there is a similar narrow focus. In this case, feminist researchers have a tendency to essentialize the female experience and they ignore racism and ethnic variation. This is, this is keeping you on target. In so doing, what happen is feminists have focused on the majority women, thus women of color are again left out of the discourse to the essentialization ignoring racism and ethnic variation. For women of color, the experience of having one segment of our identity overlooked as common, and so often are we in the position of having to choose sides due to the duality of the experience. Should we come down on the side of the part of feminists or should be align ourselves with ethnic researchers? In addition to the essentialism, psychology, our discipline, encourages an oversimplification, a belief in the parsimony that really encourages uhm, or discounts complex explanations. Beyond the conflict of emphasis however, may be a real divide, a deep divide that we've not investigated. We must ask, "Are the goals of feminism and multiculturalism compatible? Can the feminist position support women in a variety of roles and with a variety of contexts? Has feminist research discounted women in their roles as wives, mothers, lovers, activists? Have feminist accounted for women's diverse beliefs?" And for ethnic researchers, we must ask, "What should the multicultural position be if certain cultural practices threaten and endanger women?" Polygamy, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, punishing women for being raped, differential access for men and women to health care, education, unequal rights of ownership, assembly and political participation, unequal vulnerability to violence: these practices and conditions are standard in some parts of the world and even in some parts of our country. "Should psychology support the demands for multiculturalism if those demands do not allow for the protection of women? Are there fundamental conflicts between our commitment to gender equity and our increasing desire to represent the customs of minority cultures and religions?" Psychologists must debate these questions and clarify our priorities. 

00:15:40
PAMELA TROTMAN REID  Howeve, however, even at a minimal level, my analysis thus(ph) of the literature supports the contention that the research in psychology on women of color is disproportionately low. For example, of thousands of dissertations written each year, relatively few are on women of color. I just might, this, this particular overhead just shows in the past ah, in the past few years, if you can read that. I think you can. Ah, just for African-American women, and you know how many thousands of dissertations there are, how many were just on African-American women, and you know for other ethnic group women, there would be even fewer, typically. Uhm, further documentation is gleamed from abstracts to indicate that the science community has failed to respond adequately to questions about factors relevant to ethnic populations of women. For example, there has been little on mo, on mothering practices and ethnic groups. Not much research on women of color in work, on domestic violence in ethnic minority communities. Among the explanations for this failure is that there is an inadequate representation of ethnic minority researchers and, and people with concerns for ethnic minority people. It has been suggested that a greater representation of ethnic minority researchers may ameliorate this neglect. It seems clear, however, that culturally sensitive researchers and who are also interested in impor, in studying the importance of women is greatly needed, but this is obviously a long term solution. In the short run, we must expect and demand support from our majority colleagues. We must educate them in adapting new perspectives and strategies. Given this need to educate and establish an understanding of other worlds' views, some may think that we, the psychologists, concerned with gender and to our ethnicity, are particularly prepared to develop creative, unique, and distinctive app, approaches for explicating these identity affiliations. But the evidence suggests otherwise; ethnic minority researchers have routinely in, ignored gender, social class, religious differences, sexual orientation, and other diversity concerns. Even age and cohort distinctions had been excluded from many investigations. While this is beginning to change, as researchers increasingly incorporate the complexity of real, of the real world, we can still point too often to those investigations that seemed mired in simplicity. We too often have followed in the footsteps of those traditionalists whom we chastise for their narrow vision. We, too often, have implicitly and explicitly accepted the perspectives, assumptions, and stereotypes along with the biases of our psychological predecessors, with respect to ethnic psychological functioning and in areas of female modeling. This, of course, is a serious charge, but the evidence mounts that just as white male psychologist viewed the world through their own narrow lens of white maleness, our identity groups, be the ethnic or female, may have led us to simil, to be a similarly narrow in scope. The examples abound in which we as ethnic minorities concern ourselves only with the unidimensional view of our own identity, privileging one set of issues and suggesting that some identities are more valuable than others. For example, the exclusion of gender issues in culture, in cultural and ethnic research is apparent when we examined some key topics. For example, I looked at ab, abstracts over the past five years, so very recently, fewer than 25 percent of acculturation publications included girls, women, or gender. Fewer than 20 percent of the publications discussing racism included them. And fewer than 18 percent of the publications on cultural diversity did. Over the past three years, publications addressing Asian popu, in publications addressing Asian populations, fewer than 20 percent discussed gender, fewer than 5 percent specifically included girls or women. Of publications addressing Hispanic populations, a similar percentage, less than 20 percent had any gender mention or uhm, fewer than 5 percent included girls or women. Among Native American studies, fewer than 12 percent addressed gender or girls and women. Not surprisingly, for African-Americans, since the overall number of publication has been greater and there is a longer history of this research, the proportions addressing gender issues are slightly higher than for other with about 30 percent including gender and 15 percent addressing girls or women. Uhm, a few years ago, a student and I did a, had a publication where we saw(ph) a si, similar very low percents when we examined feminist topics. When we looked at issues of rape, body image, or domestic violence, we see low percentages under 10 percent and sometimes under 5 percent of feminist ah, literature including ethnicity. Instead of retreading the familiar psychological model, it seems time for us to consider abandoning the approach of assessing one domain at a time and to accept the responsibility and the challenge for understanding how and why we examine ethnicity and culture and why we include or exclude class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and a host of other identities. In part, we know that the exclusion of gender in multicultural research is explained in the same way we can explain the exclusion of multiculturalism in the rest of psychology. That is, many researchers have a limited view. Psychologists have been trained to pick out an issue and attack it myopically. The question of how gender and ethnicity intersect with each other and with social class constraints are question(ph) often ignored and overlooked. In fact, connecting or conducting research in a, in context and with attention to ah, intersections of gender, ethnicity, and other factors is actively avoided. As one colleague told me, "I'm interested in studying pure phenomena." I guess he knows pure generic people in which to examine these. Some of us may also make the decision to study only ethnicity or only gender without recognizing the limitations of so doing. The resistance to changing paradigms is of course not a new phenomenon but it's frustrating nevertheless. In the multicultural field, we must be vigilant, lest a pattern of essentialism emerges in with, in which an ethnic group's reality is interpreted solely through the norms of a particular background through a particular given social class or from the perspective of a particular set of experiences. Is there a standard ethnic group? The evidence from multiple sources is that for too many psychologists, the focus of research has been narrowly aimed on one segment of the population to the virtual exclusion of others. For example, as the extensive attention to the experiences of white middle class women has discouraged awareness of the lives of poor women and the experiences of women of color, in the multicultural literature, the urban experience has been instantiated in the lives of select(ph) groups of African-Americans, and Latinos, and Latinas to the exclusion of other groups. We have reified stereotypes. For example, who thinks about Asians when we mention poor inner city residents? Yet, there are large communities of poor Chinese who have lived for generations in neighborhoods of New York City and San Francisco, and we know little about their experiences. Who insists that we include female concerns when we examine the treatment of minority athletes? How often have we let ethnic differences substitute for class issues? 

00:24:15
PAMELA TROTMAN REID  Let me suggest the need for mental revolution, a paradigmatic shift, a change in our thinking, gender and the concomitant behavior, roles, expectations, and stereotypes are not a biological given neither are they immutable facts of life. Indeed, most of us already accepted our gender like our ethnicity is primarily a social construction. Both are dynamic representations and negotiations based on shared understandings, belief, and practices. But I think we must go even further in that direction and suggest that gender constitutes a culture. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:00
PAMELA TROTMAN REID  What comprises any culture? Customs such as dress, grooming habits, child-rearing practices, and the like, language defined as vocabulary, style, or manner of speaking, a shared understanding about life expectations or tradition of a certain type of work and lifestyle, a feeling of belonging and a sense of other. As we review all of these domains that we, as people of color, have, a used to identify and signify our similarities with each other and our differences from the majority. I don't know the rest of it is. Uhm, (laughs) we can see that we see similar ah, findings and ah, gender, and that we may have made an egregious error in overlooking a certain area that gender may constitute our culture and that perhaps women of color need a new language, a new terminology to scri, to describe ourselves as multicultural in a new way. A critical dimension of research has been terminology, the use of nomenclature. The definitions of differences are really important. In an essay written a few years ago, June Jordan pointed out that those who have power get to define difference. And we should be clear the subtexts of our conversation today is about power and control in research and in other domains. Everyone recognizes that current definitions represent more than trivial changes in our terminology. They indicate that our thinking has changed and possibly also our perceptions. Thus, we may that note that just a few decades ago, gender and sex were terms use interchangeably as we referred to biological, social, and behavioral characteristics. Feminist scholar, scholars, however, White females grab the power and began to insist on differentiating between biological characteristics and those traits influenced by social factors. Through their insistence, sex became the former and gender the latter. And the discourse on sexual orientation, terms have also been transformed by, by those who took over the power to define the difference. So gay and queer have new richer meanings, while other terms like homosexual have fallen significantly from common use. I do not actually have the new terms to suggest inclusion of woman of color but when research is conducted on an ethnic group, African-Americans let's say, and women are left out maybe we need a term. When findings come, are concluding that women do certain things and those women do not include women of color, maybe we need some terminology. As psychologists, we can take a challenge and be in the vanguard and move out of the established paradigms and avoid being misled in our interpretations of the behaviors of people of color who are female. We can reexamine our perspectives. We can reject the stereotyped conceptualizations and we can develop more complex, theoretical, and practical understanding. If we are to accept the challenge to consider gender in context and as culture, we may have to invent not only new terms but new ways of referring to our research issues. We may be led to new interpretations and even to new questions, but I think that if we follow these leads, we will end up with two or more valid meaning and more useful strategies to unfolding the complexity of our lives. Thank you. (clapping) Thank you.

00:28:50
DERALD WING SUE  You know, I set the light to ah, introduce uhm, our next speaker but before I do that I wanna ask the audience ah, two questions. If you really wanna understand sexism, who do you ask, men or women? Okay. Now, think about your answer to that. If you really wanna understand about racism, who do you ask, white folks or people of color? Then why the heck are we having a white man talk about this topic is, is issue and I think that the answer that will come clearly evident to all of us is that Michael D'Andrea really understands what it is to be a white male in this society and that's the issue that we talked about on the difficult dialogues dealing with uhm, ah, the issue of white privilege. Michael D'Andrea is a cultural critic and a counselor for social justice. He is currently a professor in the Department of Counselor Education at the University of Hawaii and executive director of the National Institute on Multicultural Competence. Dr. D'Andrea is nationally known for his known for his expertise in a broad range of issues related to multicultural counseling. He has over 100 professional publications, most of which address a host of topics related to multiculturalism in general and white racism in particular. Michael notes that he has been significantly influenced in his understanding about gender issues, gay and lesbian concerns, and feminism by numerous researchers and writers including Mary Ballou, Belle Hooks, Laura Brown, Patris, Patricia Aaredondo and others. However, he acknowledges that his commitment to support women's right is largely fueled by the many things he has learned about love and feminism from his colleague, comrade, and life partner Dr. Judy Daniels and his two daughters 21-year-old, Karashi(ph), and 2-year-old Mahealani Daniels. While Dr. D'Andrea is wildly known for his research and writings in multicultural counseling, including numerous research publications that focus on gender differences among African-Americans, Native Americans, and Native Hawaiian children and adolescents, he is even more respected for the consistent ways in which he has confronted the problems of racism, sexism, and classicism in our society and profession. Anyone who knows Michael is aware of the passion and conviction he brings to issues of social justice. I'm sure you will understand after his address this afternoon why many of us refer to him as a white brother of color. Brothers and sisters, I have the distinct pleasure of introducing my brother, Michael D'Andrea. 

00:32:20
Michael D'Andrea, Ed.D. 

00:32:20
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  We're gonna, were gonna hold that to a little bit later. We're gonna hold that just a little bit later. Let me first give praise and thanks for all of you being here and for my, as team colleague for letting me share the stage. Wasn't she provocative in her thinking and sharing her genius. Pamela, come on! Let's hear it for Pamela. Pamela Reid a leader, a woman of vision. Let me also thank Dr. Derald Sue who like many of you serves for me as a mentor and a role model and a real visionary in this field but I have been fortunate to also know Derald as a friend and a brother and I wanna publicly thank him for all of the roles he plays for all of us in this room. Ah, part of my Italian Catholic working class background is I was told by my father when special things happen and people work hard to make them happen, it's important to give praise and thanks and so if she would beg my attention for a minute, there had been several people, many people that we, we don't even know but some of the names come up. I, I'd like to ask those people that have brought us from near and far who had spent tower(ph), tireless hours. Organizing and fitting the details we know and I'll ask his people at the risk of embarrassing them 'coz we really need to take time to salute and honor them. Rosie Bingham and Steven James and Lisa Porche-Burke would you please stand and Derald Wing Sue, Melba, hold it, hold it, Melba Vasquez, would you all please just stand for a minute and I know there are other folks in this room that have done some things to make this such a success. Would you stand up if you had anything to do and let's salute these brothers and sisters for bringing us together in this special place. We thank you, we honor you. Stand up. Can we get up and salute these people. Let's get up and salute these people. These are family. These are our family. This is our family. This is our family. Let me also extend thanks to my extended family, to members of the National Institute of Multicultural Competence. Patricia Aaredondo, Allen, and Mary Ivy, Thomas Parham, Derald Sue, Dan Luck, Judy Daniels, and Beverly O'Brian. They are a support system and help build courage into our profession. Let me thank Judy Daniels, my soul mate and partner, and I'd like to take a minute. Could I, I wanna get personal with you. I wanna kinda, kinda, shift a little bit from the academic. I'll give, I'll give you some of that but I wanna make personal. I'd like it to introduce you to the, one of the reasons why I really think it's important for us to support feminism. Could I, can I have Mahealani. Can I have Mahealani. I, I'd just like you to in, just to meet her. She's a cute little girl. This is Mahealani. And, and this is why it's important to me to help support women's movement as well as harsh struggle. I, I wanna to say something. This will make sense to those of you that have children and, and you understand this that the spirit really speaks to us as parents through the children. They provide guidance. The spirit really does speak through the children and in lying in bed at night with Mahealani, she does still sleep with us and when she is asleep, I hear the spirit talking to me as many of you. You want some of you know what I mean. And the spirit from her says to me, " I am your little baby. I depend on you for psychological assistance to nurture me emotionally, to build my spirit so I understand spirituality, and to provide the support I'll need to grow 'coz I'm just a little baby. To do that you must remain strong and sober and serious and committed and help me develop and realize my potential to make a better world. That if you do that Daddy, it will not just be good for me but it will be good for you, and if it's good for you and I, it will make this world a better place." And so I wanted to thank you for the message that, and share that with you. Hello baby. Can I, Can I have her? I have, I have to tell you the second message, for sure. As I was preparing for this presentation on, I thank you on, on, on gender and, and multiculturalism, she was watching me prepare over the last several months and one night when she was asleep her voice called again and as I was lying next to her, her voice said in the firmer voice, " Michael, you really have been a bit tardy dealing with your own sexism. Now I know that you don't intentionally mean to help perpetuate sexism and structural patriarch in our society but you really do. And brother you do a good job dealing with racism and acknowledging that but you really do have to focus in on how you contribute to sexism. And I've come to realize something through Mahealani that Judy has shared with me and that's the personal tug that I experienced as a male, wanting to share in the responsibility of raising a child and letting ego and achievement drive get in the way. That achievement drive comes from structural patriarchy that unconsciously and consciously tells males it's okay to achieve. That's your identity. That's what you're supposed to do. And so many of us turn to our intimate partners and the mothers of our children to play double time: To teach, to develop a career, to wash the clothes, to raise the children, to get up with the children at night. And so I've learned a little bit more about my own sexism in preparing for this and through Judy and Mahealani. I know I'm not alone here brothers. I really know I'm not alone because when I'm with white folks, we don't talk and acknowledge our privilege and the ways in which we perpetuate racism. And when I'm with other men, Daryl when we get together, and Thomas when we get together, Allen Ivy when we get together, we don't spend as much time talking about fem, feminism and patriarchy and oppression on women as much as we really do speak about racism. We need to make a commitment to talk about patriarchy and racism in the same voice. 

00:39:55
[sil] 

00:39:55
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Before we leave this convention but as much more than just acknowledging our own white privilege and male privilege, you know, I know white folks. I am a white folk. I know my people. Some white people feel it's a big step to acknowledge their privileged and ways in which they perpetuate racism. It's not enough to confess and to feel good that we absolved our contribution by acknowledging our privilege. That's a step and for some folks it's a big step. But as Thomas Parham has said so eloquently, there is a difference between desegregation and integration. We live in a desegregated, not an integrated society. We are a part of a desegregated APA, not an integrated APA. If we had an integrated APA in society, there would be no controversy about Ebonics. There would be no call for cuts to bilingual education. We would see these ways of speaking as fundamentally enrichening our lives in purpose and ways of communicating one another. We need to do much more than simply acknowledge our racism and sexism. We need to take risks. So when we leave here, don't feel good about taking just a risk to announce publicly how we contribute. Go back home and make a change and make a difference in your universities and your communities and the agencies that you work. It's a white person's problem. And it's a men's problem. And so I would ask you all and Judy and Mahealani and other friends here, when in my thoughts, words or deeds that you see ways in which I perpetuate racism or sexism, please charge it to my head that's limited by ignorance of the things I do not know what I do and change to my ego that handicaps me from promoting insensitivity and lack of compassion for others because of my focus on my unique meanness but don't charge it to my heart with its boundless and unrealized love for the entire human family. Be patient with me. Confront me. Stay with me. Help me see how I hinder others. Make me stronger. Work together with me so that together we can find the courage to overcome the racism and sexism in our society. My research and my work and my studies have taught me and I do believe that all white people are adversely affected by racism, that all men regardless of color and ethnicity are adversely affected by sexism and patriarchy. Too many of us deny this, but if we could begin to acknowledge the ways in which we unintentionally perpetuate racism and patriarchy, it would be a major step forward. And if we could extend our acknowledgement to risk taking, we could help build a beloved community that Dr. King talked about 20 years ago. Now standing together at the dawning of the 21st century, in this special place, at this special conference we all intuitively and consciously are aware that big things are going to happen in the coming decades. Ultimately, psychologists and counselors can decide which group they wanna join. There are three groups as things changed. You can be among those who watch as new things happen. Or you can be among that group of people who make new things happen. Or you can choose to be among that group of people who wonder what the hell is happening. I'd urge you to leave here with a commitment to be a part of the second group, those of us who make things happen. In order to do so, it's important to reflect and accurately understand where we as a nation and our profession have come from to understand our history, our progress and our challenges, where we are, where we've come from. The history of this nation reflects a schizophrenic-like roots in which the ideals and principles upon which this country was founded sharply contrast with our nation's political and structural realities. The great experiment and democracy which is fueled by the belief that a healthy nation and a healthy people are afforded opportunities to realize their individual and their collective potential within a social environment that is supposed to guarantee all of us liberty and justice. But we know that these ideals as well as the political, psychological, and spiritual health of our nation has been marred historically by horrific forms of human suffering and injustice that continue to be perpetuated in many present forms, structural racism, structural patriarchy, and cultural oppression. Historically we know the lessons, the genocide of the native people. A genocide more horrific than we can imagine has created post traumatic stress that's intergenerational, that's what we call it. Duran and Duran more accurately acknowledged it is a soul wound, a soul wound that reflects the disconnection and the genocide in the murder and suffering of over 400 years and yet some white colleagues will say to me, "They need to get over it. That's all". "African-Americans need to get over that slavery thing, that's all. Hispanic folks need to get over their oppression, that's all. They really need to move on and not have a chip on their shoulder." We need to understand new epistemological frameworks that include soul wound and how it's passed on intergenerationally, how it not only negatively impacts the lives of people of color who have been subjected to ruthless treatment but how it affects us as white folks as well and disconnects us from a spiritual community. Hundreds of millions of people from African descent killed en route to America, 200 hundred years of legalized slavery in this country. The interment of Japanese, persons in World War II. The illegal overthrow of the nation of Hawaii and the story of genocide among the native Hawaiian people that's rarely told. The criminalization and pathologicalization of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons. The injustice and disrespect that continues to be delivered to the physically challenged, to the elderly and poor persons of this country. The fields of counseling and psychology have done much to abide and abet in the perpetuation of these injustices and psychological oppression and spiritual injur, injury of women and gays and persons of color. The use of tests that are culturally bias, misdiagnoses, theories of genetic inferiority that plumped white superiority forced institutionalization and forced medication, electroshock treatment that was disproportionately imposed on women in the 50s, lobotomies that was disproportionately implanted on pe, poor persons in this country, to the intellectual hegemony that promotes and sustains beliefs about patriarchy and white supremacy in our schools and training programs. This hegemony has persisted and would have continued to persist unless the pioneers in the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, the Gay and Lesbian Movement, helped reshape our thinking and helped us move beyond the intellectual parochialism that characterized the field of counseling and psychology up until the '60s. We've made much progress from these pioneers. We've dismantled in a partite system in the United States, that's not psychologically healthy. We have helped women and supported women in their right to choose their reproductive rights. It's not healthy to eliminate choice of women. It disempowers them. We have elevated the dignity of gay and lesbian persons and have not pathologized them as deficit and incomplete. These movements have helped us. Can you imagine what it would be like today if the American Psychological Association did not have the input and the genius of Liza Porche-Burke, of Judy Daniels, of Carol Gilligan, of Rosie Bingham, of Laura Brown, of Pamela Reid? All of these sisters and many more have made us better people and a better organization. They've expanded our understanding and helped increase our respect. The multicultural and Women's Movement helped us move ahead and understand that there are between group differences. 

00:50:15
MICHAEL D'ANDREA African-Americans are not like Asian-Americans are not like native Americans. Men are different psychologically than women. But in an ironic way until the mid of the 1980s, we found that while our understanding of between group differences help expanded our knowledge base, it really did present a new kind of intellectual parochialism. It led us to stereotype. These parameters limited a fuller and more accurate understanding of gender and cultural racial group variation. All women are not the same. All men are not the same. They construct different meaning, experience different challenges to their lives. And so in the mid-80s, with Jeanette Helmes and, and William Cross and Thomas Parham and so many others, they pioneered and helped explore and expand our understanding, they tackled the challenge of within group differences. And as we became more enlightened and more conscious of the complexity of human development, we realize that the focus on between group differences and within group differences are still insufficient. They represent new forms of intellectual parochialism. We have come to know that the individual and intrapsychic focus that has characterized the field of psychology is inadequate to promote the mental health of women and persons of color in this society. And we have come to learn that the spiritual impoverishment of our profession has resulted in disrespectful, ineffective and even harmful practices in our training programs and in our clinical settings. With all these in mind, we find ourselves in this present moment knowing full well although we don't always acknowledge it that we are all multidimensional persons that live lives and construct meaning of the world that reflect the convergence of multiple identities, multiple privileges and various forms of oppression. The time has come to move beyond, between, and within group differences and to examine and study and teach and promote psychological practice that reflects a heightened understanding of the convergence of gender, of race, of physical disability, of socioeconomic class. We are becoming increasingly aware of three things. At the present moment, we are aware of our multidimensionality of the need to promote convergence. We are also aware of the need to promote new mental health paradigms that go beyond individual and intrapsychic considerations that reflect a heightened understanding of the intimate links and complex connections that exist between the individual and their socio-environment, the vital connections. This is a mental health issue, this is not just political activism but the vital connections that link notions of freedom, that link justice, that link notions of freedom and justice with mental health and psychological be, well-being. We need to link a greater understanding of how the intellectual hegemony of our training programs, how our support for cultural oppression promote psychological problem in those less privileged. We know, we do know although we often deny the negative psychological and spiritual impact of structural racism and patriarchy within a capitalist society. A capitalist society that values profits over people. A capitalist society that endorses managed care policies over quality care policies. A capitalist society that promotes a commitment to materialism over the desire to strive to realize our spiritual essence, our interconnectedness. A capitalist society that effectively uses racism and sexism to disconnect and to distort our understanding of reality. These are our challenges. We're on the edge of a new frontier. We are giving birth to new paradigms and we have to be clear but how, how is this structural racism and patriarchy and white superiority manifested today. Dr. D'Andrea concretely, my colleague has said so much about that we will add something to it. Health care disparity is under the tutelage of Dr. Patricia Arredondo, APA is studying the health care disparities among different racial groups in men and women. More women are beaten and killed in their homes than outside of their homes. There are ten times more animal shelters in the United States than there are shelters for victims of domestic violence and homelessness. Women still make 72 cents for every dollar a men makes with the same qualifications. Hate crimes are up. Eighteen million people in this land live in poverty and are subjected to stresses that none of us can empathize with. Most of these eight mill, eighteen million are young, white and female. There's more spending on a present industrial complex that now houses over two million mostly persons of color who are male. Death row bursting at its seams, mostly men of color. We continue to ignore taking action against the racist drug policy in the United States. We have a president, a newly elected president who began to promote what I call the illusion of inclusion. (clapping) The illusion of inclusion. He had a parade at his national convention. And watching it on TV had to be careful, or it would catch you, the illusion of inclusion. In his first two weeks what has this president done who advocates for One America in the first week. He has done more in the first week to promote cultural oppression, to reinforce the notion of White supremacy, to help promote a notion and support the perpetuation of structural racism and sex. How has he done this? In his first week, he has declared war against women's right to choice. In the first week, (clapping) in the first week he has said, "We must turn our backs on dysfunctional schools that have been underfer, under funded and that are primarily in communities comprised of people of color and give vouchers. "We need to abandon public education and form new elites in this country. He has proposed a tax break $170 billion tax break. Who will receive the benefits when we're talking about gender and race? Primarily the wealthiest 1 percent. Most of those are white and male. He has advocated that we need to test every child to maintain quality control of our schools from the 3rd to the 12th grade, but he hasn't said that those tests are culturally biased. He hasn't said that those tests lead to a disproportionate number of African-American and Latino, and native American children on the mainland being funneled into Special Education programs. They're culturally biased and we sit silently. We just conducted a study in Hawaii of a 182,000 public school students and found that structural racism and colonialism continues to persist. We have the most significant number of special ed students in Hawaii, are Hawaiian males. It's a form of colonialization. There is nothing special about special education. There's (clapping) nothing, ask a special ed student who has been stigmatized. Ask a special ed adolescent who somehow is depressed, and hurt and angered that we refuse to acknowledge and understand his and her genius. There's a new elite being built when, when you are in the first grade, the girls and the boys in the first grade, their career options are like this and once a standardized test that's culturally biased comes into play and diagnoses you for special ed, your career options are little. We know that, and we remain silent. How about in APA and in the counseling profession? I heard the other day that we only have 6 percent of our membership in APA of coming from diverse cultural racial in the year 2001? That's grade a of a D. That's not a B grade. That's not an A grade. That's a D grade. Ninety-five percent of the chairpersons in psychology programs are White and male. They formulate policy. They tend to have the power. We continue to use, as Pamela had said, "culturally and racially, and gender-biased research models and atte, and assessment techniques." There still is a general denial of the spiritual domain in our research, in our training, and in our clinical practices. Only 13 percent of all the full professors in this country are female. Only 13 percent. This is how structural racism and patriarchy is at least in part being perpetuated, and we must not contribute to this through the silence. The silence is deafening because there is violence in our silence. There really is. What, what can we do? What can we do? We can commit ourselves to formulating a plan of action before we leave this conference. We can commit ourselves to concrete action to build a mass movement, what Bell Hookes calls a culture of resistance, a culture of hope, resistance that combats the injustice and oppression in general, and racism, and patriarchy in particular. We need to formulate a plan. We could do that if we were 30. We could do that at the Town Hall meeting. Let, let's go a little bit further. What do we need to do? We need to articulate clearly that we all live in a racist, sexist, patriarchal capitalist society that does not have our health in its best interest. We must never allow guest to come to the Multicultural Summit and make presentations without articulating. We are embedded in a racist, patriarchal, capitalist system. We need those voices raised. We need to move beyond our intellectual parochialism by embracing the multidimensionality of human development and learn about the convergence of race, class and gender. We need to develop new models of mental health. Pablo Freire has given us a gift in his model of critical consciousness, but more recently Allen and Mary Ivy have written about psychology for a liberation, and more recently Bell Hookes has talked about liberatory mental health. We can no longer maintain intellectual parochialism where our mental health is measured by our achievements and self-esteem and tendency to self-actualize. The height of mental health in a pluralistic society has to be measured by one's commitment in action to transform our society, to promote the politicalization of our communities, and to help promote social justice advocacy. We need new paradigms, new ways of thinking about health before we self-destruct. (clapping) 

01:03:30
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  I'm almost done. I am almost done. These models move, move from individual paradigms to self in relation. We must embrace and recognize the thunder of postmodernism, and its power to complement multiculturalism. We must demonstrate behaviors that really lead to the promotion of social justice that demonstrate, and it's sad to say, Theresa Lomtrombois(ph) and Joseph Trimble, you say it well. We are raping mother Earth, toxifying our environment. We can learn from a Native American. We have to stop that. We will jeopardize our long-term survival. We need to embrace Native American traditions. We can leave here with a plan, and I'm gonna encourage everyone to help get input. Patricia Arredondo is planning and organizing a march and rally at the American Counseling Association in San Antonio to promote issues of anti-violence and justice. We need people here to join us in San Francisco in August. We hope to organize another march and rally that talks about libratory mental health. The importance of eliminating violence in our communities and we need your input, and we'll have a table set-up that you can give us input. We need to identify 30 universities that we can invite speakers from here to go to your universities and talk about race, and gender, and class, and the convergence of that in order that we help to work nationally to build a mass movement, and to come back to this conference two years from now, and to reflect and build forward. Most of all, we need to exercise the right to dream. We need to exercise the right to dream, to combat the cynicism of our times. We need to use hope and inspiration as weapons of progress and survival. We need to use love to guide us and motivate us, to serve the human family. We need to work as an association to build beloved communities, communities where doctors and psychologists are more concerned about public health than personal wealth, of lawyers who are more concerned about justice than a judgeship, of teachers who are more concerned about teaching 'coz they can't help it and not just for a living. Despite the economic, despite the economic prosperity of their time, there is darkness in this land. This darkness hampers our vision and our potential, and without vision, the people will perish. Darkness in our prisons. Darkness in our families of poverty. Darkness when women are assaulted every very 12 seconds. Darkness when children are sexually abused. Darkness when we do not tolerate and respect the dignity of our diversity. We can overcome that darkness. What can we do out? There is a way out. There is a way out of the darkness. New mental health paradigms is a way out. Collective action is a way out. Justice is a way out. Love that guides us is a way out, and peace is a way out. When we leave here, let them say that something special happened at the Multicultural Summit, the second one. Let them know that there were people ready to build a new society, they heed the call of conscience and were aware that a peace train was on the rail. We can join on the peace train. You have to listen quietly. You can hear the peace train. We can hear the peace train. Jonathan, will you help me with that. (music playing) A Peace Train. You can hear the Peace Train. If we build peace, if we stand as a light on the edge of darkness, we'll build a great nation. They'll know us as people who cared about women. They'll know us as a profession who held up the dignity of gays and lesbians. They'll know us as able-bodied people who promoted and respected the physically challenged. They'll recognize us as a family. We need to be happy. To think about the good things that can come. Here in Santa Barbara, I'm convinced something good has begun. It's the Peace Train. All of you may not want to be passengers on the Peace Train but you're all invited. Combat the cynicism of our time. Build hope and use love and inspiration as weapons. We need an alternative to the DSM-4. We (clapping) need an alternative to the DSM-4. We need to stop medicating our children in large classrooms and give them the dignity, written in as law. We are over medicating our children and most of them are poor and children of color. Men, we have to stop the violence against women. Heterosexual people, we need to stop the violence against the gays, and lesbians, and bisexuals. I'm gonna ask how many people here think they might be interested in joining on the Peace Train. Can you raise your hands? Now, just hold them on, I, I need to see who is interested in joining. We have plenty of room, ladies and gentlemen, and brothers and sisters. A, in order to, you probably, you're probably wondering what do you have to do to get a ticket for the Peace Train, aren't you? Aren't you wondering? It don't cost no money, but it does cost. To get on the Peace Train, we have to be willing to think in new ways about our roles and commitment to promote mental health. We have to think in new ways. We have to think beyond racism. We have to think beyond sexism. We have to think beyond DSM-4. We have to think beyond Midland. We have to think about building beloved communities. We have to think about hope. We have to think and work to build justice. We need to feel peace in this world. I need some folks to come up here and help me think clear. Derald and, Pamela, and Melba, you can help me think clear about this dimension, but I need other people. Lisa, Portia, Burke(ph) and Rosie(ph), would you come up here? I, I need some folks to help me to, they'll help us think clear. Give them a little applause. Help them come up here. Come on up here, sister. And Patricia Arredondo, will you come up here and help us, help us think clear. Help us, and, and Allen Ivy, and Mary Ivy could you come up here. This is our family. Could you come up, and Mark Hope. Could you come up here, help us think clearly about gay and lesbian issues. And who else do we have? Joe Conorado and Ingrid, could you come up here? We need your help, Joe. Come on up here. Come on up here. This is part of our family. Manny Cassas, could you come up here? We need some more help. Judy Daniels, can you come up here? Brian Kim help us think about Asians in a new way. Come up here Brian. Please come up here. I am gonna ask you as we close, as we close. The ticket for the Peace Train is about thinking. We have to think in new ways. What do we have to do? Oh, that's not gonna get you on the Peace Train. We got to think. What do we have to do? 

01:11:55
  Think. 

01:12:00
MICHAEL D'ANDREA We've got to think. We've got to think of new paradigms and way of leaving this convention with a plan. What do we have to do? 

01:12:05
 Think. 

01:12:05
MICHAEL D'ANDREA We have to think clearly. As you help us think. Why don't you get yourself up as we think together? Let's put our hands together. Aretha will help us think before we leave. Let's get up. Get yourself up. Come on. And shake it if you feel it. Shake it if you feel it. We've gotta think beyond racism, that should do it. We gotta think beyond patriarchy. Come on, be with me here. We gotta think. We gotta think about freedom. Freedom. Come on be with me here(ph). What do we have to do? What do we have to do? Let freedom(ph) lead(ph) the way. 

01:13:10

01:13:10
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Think. Think beyond the reason put forth. And Joe Trimble, where are you? Joe Trimble, come on up to the podium. Come up here. We all gotta think.
