THERAPY Talks 

00:01:35
NANCY BUCK Do you remember when you were a child, perhaps learning the stories that the prince met the princess and off they went happily ever after? For many people that either are seeking your help in counseling or perhaps along the way in other things you've been talking about, eventually they get to the part where they say to you, “What happened to the happy in my happily ever after? I had my dreams come true. Perhaps I found my prince or princess charming. Perhaps I got on the career path that I wanted to get on. Perhaps I have the children that I want. And still, I'm not happy. Is this all there is?” What do we, as mental health practitioners, know about helping our clients find their mental health and happiness. What do you define as mental health and happiness? Do you have a working definition of mental health and happiness? It's a really interesting idea. It's a really interesting thought. In fact, much has been talked about recently, probably spurred on most intensely by the terrible school shooting in Newtown Connecticut where there was an increase in funding, an increase talk not only about gun control but also about mental health and having an increased funding in mental health services. But do they really mean mental health? Or do they mean preventing mental illness? There was a time in our country, in our culture, where physical health meant the absence of physical disease. But a really interesting thing has happened. We have a completely different understanding of what it means to be in good shape and to be this physically healthy. Most people from age six and older can tell you exactly what it takes to get into better physical health and better physical shape. Most people know that you need to engage in regular activity, regular physical activity. Often that includes cardiovascular training. It also includes muscle toning, whether through weight lifting or resistance training. It also includes some kind of stretching, perhaps yoga or more. Also includes making sure you have at least glasses of eight ounces of water a day. And having a well balanced diet. Spending some time in nature. Some times in prayer or meditation. People know the answers. Now whether they choose to do it or not, that's a completely different question. But what does it take to get into better physical shape and to be in better physical condition? People know the answer. But what is the answer for improving, actually focusing on developing and improving and then maintaining good mental health that also includes happiness? Do you know? Do you have a definition? Let me give you one other example. This I learned about from a friend of mine who is a retired dentist. And what he told me was the very first thing he learned in dental school was how to make false teeth. And the reason for that was the assumption that nobody would get out alive with their own teeth. Eventually your teeth would be so bad they would fall out and you'd have to get false teeth. Isn't that a funny idea? He said but somewhere along the line somebody decided, some brilliant man decided that taking good care of all health and dental health could be a public health issue. In fact he said the joke, the running joke, was if all dentists started on the east coast to fill all the cavities, they'd get as far as Philadelphia and then would have to go back and start again because they couldn't keep up with the demand of how fast people were getting cavities in their teeth. And now again most children learn it in school. And from around age six and older or maybe even younger, they know we all know what to do for good oral health and good dental health. Brush your teeth after every meal. Floss at least twice a day. I remember learning it as a child. Only floss the teeth you wanna keep. See your dental hygienist at least twice a year. And make sure you're doing everything you can to maintain good oral and dental care. We knew it. We have an answer to that. So what is our answer for good mental health and happiness? That's my challenge to you in this talk. Do you have a working definition? If you're a mental health professional working with people to help them develop, improve and maintain their good mental health, what are you aiming for? Do you have a definition of it? My definition that I wanna share with you is not the only and it doesn't have to be the best, but for me it fits. And I wanna share it with you. It comes from the work of Doctor William Glasser, a world renowned psychiatrist. He wrote the book “Reality Therapy,” which I'm guessing most of you are familiar with. And about ten years, maybe a little more, maybe more like 15 years ago, he suggested that mental health is a public health issue. And it's our job as mental health professionals to teach people to develop, improve and maintain their good mental health. His idea, you can find on the website mental health and happiness, it's well written on that particular website, exactly all that he defines. Essentially he talks about we need to develop important meaningful relationships where we don't try to control the other person and the other person doesn't try to control us, that provides a nourishing and nurturing relationship that sustains us. It's also based on the ideas of choice theory psychology. And what I wanna do is share with you the basic ingredients of what we need to do to improve our good mental health and happiness. The first of our psychological needs that we need to focus on is an issue of feeling safe, feeling secure. That when we're feeling safe and we feel secure we're able to concentrate on other things. And all of us have had this experience. You have this experience and you're not even aware of it. You walk into a building or a restaurant or a place you've never been before and even though you don't know it, you start looking around for the exits. Why do you do it? Because you wanna know how to get out in case this turns into a not safe place. Or if you've ever traveled and stayed at a hotel, one of the things that you do before you go to bed at night is you engage the locks on the door. And if they're 15 locks, you'll engage all 15 locks. You might wonder why do they have 15 locks in this place? Is this a safe place to be? But the reason you do that is because you wanna meet your need for safety and security. The second, which I mentioned a little bit ago, we all have the urge for love and belonging, for connection. We wanna believe that at least one other person on the planet cares about us and that we care about that other person. At least have one connective relationship. We may have more. The relationships certainly best include a solid connective relationship with ourselves. It also may include others, friends, family, pets. And for some, a relationship with a higher power. We also have the psychological urge for power. To make a difference. To feel as if our life has meaning. That we're influencing. We are born with these urges, not necessarily born knowing how to meet them responsibly. But power means I want my way, hopefully not at the expense of other people getting what they want and need. That would be responsible. But I want to make a difference. The fourth psychological urge that we're all born with is the urge for fun, the need for play. If for no other reason than this is a good idea, one of the good ideas to follow Doctor William Glasser, cause he's the only guy that I know that talks about that we have a basic urge for fun and play. Doctor Glassder said that fun is the genetic payoff for learning and as a species we have so much to learn in order to be able to make it independently as a human being. And when we hit the payoff of fun and play we're more likely to be interested in it. And of those of you who hang out with children you know it's true. You can't keep a child from playing and having fun. The last instruction we're born with is the urge for freedom, for choices, for options, for opportunities. Interestingly we don't want more freedom than we can handle responsibly. And there's a tension between freedom and safety. Too much freedom, not enough safety. Too much safety, not enough freedom. And one example of that certainly is what's happened to our country since September 11th. When our safety was threatened some of our freedoms decreased. And now there's a continual struggle that's going on in our society and maybe for you internally as well. But that's my working definition of mental health and happiness. The ability to meet my need for safety, love, power, fun and freedom every day. Am I succeeding in meeting those needs every day in a responsible and respectful way? And the clients I work with, are they meeting their need for safety, love, power, fun and freedom every day? Now I wanna go back to one of those needs. The basic need for fun. As I said to you before most children absolutely understand that they have the basic need for fun. You don't have to say to a child, ”Come on honey. Let's have more fun.” If you're not convinced that children can make fun anywhere, take a child to church and watch what happens. They figure out how to make fun while they're there. Now that doesn't mean the adults in the child's life are pleased with it. But they'll swing their leg till they get everybody on the pew rocking back and forth. They'll pick up the hymnal and turn it upside down. They play all the time. And we grownups, we're too grown up. Too many of us say “I'll play later.” Now maybe we take a vacation and in the vacation we spend some time playing. That's not enough. We need to meet our need for safety, love, power, fun and freedom every single day. You can't store it up for the two weeks of year that you have a vacation. In fact many of us grew up with this being told to us; “You can go and play after you get your work done, your chores done.” And for most children they were able to complete their chores and still have time for play. But are you as an adult following that same idea? Are the clients that you work with following that same idea? If you are the problem is as an adult you'll never get your work done. You'll die first. So part of the idea is figure out what can I do right now in this very day and make it more fun? Have more play in this moment. When we have more fun we are having a greater ability of meeting our basic needs and moving towards mental health and happiness. So I wanna invite you, inspire you, challenge you to think about what is your working definition of good mental health. If you're working with clients who have a general malaise, “I'm just not happy. Is this all there is?” Then what are you doing to help them focus on their definition of mental health and your definition of mental health? What can they do to improve it, to maintain it? Let's go back to what can they do to develop it. One of the things that I talk with people about is what do you do every single day to feel inspired, to have joy and laughter. At a minimum each of us has I believe, will have a happier life and greater mental health if at least once a week we laugh so hard our belly hurts and our cheeks ache. That's the idea. Certainly following the imitation or imitating children. In fact those of you who have the good fortune to hang out with and spend time with children, children are our reminders of having more fun. Too often adults say to children, “Enough fooling around. We have to get down to serious business.” And I want us to do the reverse. Enough serious business. We gotta down to the serious job of playing and having fun. In fact if you're looking for some more things to do or wanna suggest some things for your clients to do, encourage them or invite them to volunteer at least one day a week or maybe once a month in preschool daycare. Because they do an amazing thing. Those teachers dance and sing their way through the day with their children. Every activity that they transition to, they dance and sing as they clean up their toys, they dance and sing as they put on their clothes to go home for the day. Can you imagine? What would life be like if at the end of your day, actually let me say that differently, can you imagine getting through your work day and dancing and singing through your day? People might look at you like you're a little nuts but I can guarantee you you'll have more fun. So I share with you my perspective, my definition for mental health and happiness is the ability to meet our need for safety, love, power, fun and freedom every day in a responsible and respectful way. Making sure we concentrate on holding precious those loving connective relationships in our lives including the loving connected relationship each person has with themselves. I hope I've given you some food for thought, some perspective to contemplate and some ideas to enhance your practice.

THERAPY Talks 

00:15:45
SHANNON DERMER Doctor Buck, that was a fun talk. I was over here. I wasn't dancing and singing cause I didn't wanna distract you. But I did enjoy it. I did enjoy it. I do have a few questions for you that I wanted to ask a little bit more about. I enjoyed your analogies to some of the health initiatives we've had here in the United States. You mentioned teeth and things like that. One of the big initiatives we've had here in the United States is the food pyramid, which you can have lots of different things every day but they want you to focus in on some basics and how much to have it. So if you had to create a food pyramid for mental health, yes and no happiness can be lots of different things to different people, but what would you put in that pyramid to say well for most people they really should get this on their plate every day. 

00:16:40
Nancy Buck, Ph.D. 

00:16:40
NANCY BUCK  I just love that you asked that question. Here's one of the reasons. When I was a child, the food pyramid was not a pyramid. It was a circle. And my mother happened to be a person who really was very concerned about and thoughtful about food. So every day at our family dinner we would look at the, it was a wheel, and we would look, had we hit every one of the categories, and I don't remember how many there were but it was a lot. And if we did then we spun the wheel. That's what it was known as. Did you spin the wheel? Now interestingly, at that time in my life the person who was primarily responsible for the food that appeared before me was my mother. So the chances were pretty good that we could all spin the wheel cause she set it up that way. But I have actually gone back and thought about that particular notion. Now, actually, there's not only the food pyramid, now they're looking at, look at the plate and how much on your plate, should it be this, that and the other? So I have actually thought about it's a circle. It's the five basic needs, probably a circle divided into four with the very middle bulls-eye being safety and security. Now Doctor Glasser did not say like Maslow did that there's a hierarchy and if you don't have safety and security you cannot have the others. Doctor Glasser did not believe that. In fact there are people, soldiers who go to war who put their very survival at risk, but they do it to meet other needs. So he doesn't believe that there is a pyramid. However, what he did suggest and there is actually some research to attempt to look at this, is that each of us are born not with the same proportion of need. So for instance a very dear friend of mine has a very high need for fun. If it's not fun she doesn't do it. I like hanging out with her for the very reason. But then I would think somebody who's running for president has a much higher need for power than I do. I have a pretty high need for power. But that person has an even higher need for power. So at the same time you, I'm thinking about it as a circle or as a plate with the very center being safety and security. And then each day you may look at the slices of the pie; are they equal? I may be in a situation, it's been a tough winter for many people. And so the sense of fun and freedom for those who have been snow-bound and they have not necessarily seen anybody beyond their own four walls and their own children, they're in a high need for freedom and fun. So at this point that quadrant on their plate might be larger just cause their need is larger. But that's how I think about it. Not necessarily that you're spinning the wheel but that you're looking at how does the pie get divided and are you eating enough slices to satisfy that need? 

00:19:35
SHANNON DERMER  Good. So kinda like for people, and by the way I'm showing my age because I don't think it is a food pyramid anymore. Sorry U.S. Government. But that's what I remember growing up. And you talked about these things that we remember. I remember the food pyramid and I remember the floss every day and those types of things. But what you're saying is that just like people have different metabolisms and they exercise more that yeah there are those basic needs but how much they need of those and how much they enjoy of them is going to be different. So it's hard to give exact proportions. But you know what needs to be on the plate and it's those needs. If you were in charge of the world and you wanted to get this message out to everyone that about fulfilling these basic needs and how to get their mental health hygiene met, I guess, what would that campaign look like? What would you go out and do or what would your slogan be? 

00:20:35
NANCY BUCK Don't know that I have a slogan. I'm on the campaign though. I have a personal relationship to what happened in Newtown. And before that what I remember very vividly, the experience I had when I heard about Columbine. And at that time having been a student and a teacher of Doctor Glasser's ideas, I immediately felt guilty that I wasn't doing enough. Now I know that's a little bit grandiose. But then 14 years later when Newtown happened I said, “That's enough, I need to do something.” So I actually am on a campaign. One of the things I would do is give a therapy talk, sharing with people the ideas that mental health is a public health issue and that we as mental health practitioners, I think, it's our obligation to have a clear understanding of what mental health is. It's not just the absence of mental illness. And that your definition may not be the same as my definition, but can we come up with one that's close and then we talk about it. Just like I'm sure not every practitioner would say the things you need to do to get into better physical shape are exactly the same, but they're close enough. And again then my vision gets even bigger, which may be if I have enough influence, exciting for some people, but I want us to be training mental health practitioners or officers to be in absolutely every school in the country. Every school, any person who walks into any school in the United States today, everybody knows who's the child who is not succeeding in school socially. And most adults, most schools do a great job of surrounding that child with the adults and the support to help them. But what are they doing with that child's classmates to help the classmates understand? It takes a village of us being connected together, what can we do to succeed in having that child feel like they're a part? Actually there was a very interesting article that was written in The New Yorker where the guy, I don't remember his name, I apologize, but the author shifted from calling the child “a loner” to “a failed joiner.” The child wanted to join, he wanted to belong, but he didn't succeed in doing it. And every child in every school knows who that failed joiner is, and every adult does. And I believe what we can do is to have a mental health officer in every school who's working with everybody in the school, everybody including the parents. 

00:23:10
SHANNON DERMER Not just the problem children. 

00:23:10
NANCY BUCK Not just to say what is mental health and what are you doing today to be mentally healthy? And what do you do to help your neighbor have a better day? If that happens my hope is that Newtown will never happen again. 

00:23:25
SHANNON DERMER That is quite the campaign. That would be an important one to everyone in light of all the things that have happened. But also because I think that we teach our children how to be happier children which becomes happier adults which then goes on to the next generation. When we help this generation, we're helping future generations. So that is quite the campaign and I hope to see it fulfilled. I wanna ask you though because some of the things you were talking about, it seem like relate to language a little bit when you mentioned the article that it wasn't someone who was a loner, it was someone who failed to be a joiner. How important do you think language is for us as clinicians when we're talking about happiness, the words that we choose, the way we choose to put it into context? 

00:24:15
NANCY BUCK So if people didn't know better, they might think that I gave you these questions to ask cause it's kind of funny. It's everything. How we make meaning of the world is everything. And how we make meaning is represented through our language. And I know you know this and probably other people do as well. The Inuit people have, I think it's 32 words for snow. We have one. We have modifiers, dirty snow, clean snow, sparkling snow. But we have one. Because the Inuit have, their life is snow. So everything that they see and understand and their perceptions are reflected in their language and their language reflects their perception. So I think it's very important. As a clinician, hopefully we train our clinicians, practitioners, to listen to the language that our clients are using and use their language back. So if you have a person who's a thinker and you ask what feelings are occurring, they'll tell you I think I feel this way. Or the opposite person who's a feeler and “What are your thoughts?” “Well I don't know. I know I feel bad.” So that's part of it as well. And certainly happiness, cause that's a lovely word. What in the world does happiness mean? And happiness for one person can mean something completely different than happiness does for another. So when we're working with clients, if you were living happily ever after and you weren't saying, “Is that all there is?” What would you be saying? What would you be doing? How would you be feeling? What would be going on in your life? And what would you be doing in your life? So that's a very specific and clear picture from the client's perspective. The same thing is true with satisfying relationships. And again we can go there for a minute. But for some people their only experience of a loving relationship is when they get kissed on this cheek and then slapped on this cheek. And then they go into the world looking for a kiss and for a slap. And when they have a relationship where they get a kiss and a kiss they say the person doesn't love me. Because that's not their experience of what love means. So we share language but we don't share meaning. And often the words may alter what we mean as well. That's pretty sophisticated stuff though. 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER We only have a couple minutes left together so I'm gonna ask you this question which is also I hope a sophisticated question but that you can give a simple and clear answer. And that's what happens if your clients have a definition of happiness that is a slap and a slap instead of a kiss and a kiss? What if their definition of happiness you don't think will actually ever get them to happy or happily ever after? 

00:27:05
NANCY BUCK Right. So to me those are really two different questions. So if it's, if it's irresponsible, immoral, illegal, I don't say you can't have that because they can. They probably do. What I might say is are you willing to experience what it might be like if it was a different cause you never want something you've never known. But I would probably start there. In addition I would say, I mean here's one; I'll be a happy teenager if I can be the best drug dealer in the high school. Well, as the counselor I don't wanna say great, let me help you be that. What I would say is if you were the best drug dealer how would your life be different? What would you be doing? What would you be thinking? How would things be? And if we can get you to that without having to go through the root of being the better drug dealer. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER So you'd focus on what they want and what they need and help them find a different path to that than maybe being the drug dealer but it would still, but their needs are still the same, they're just trying to get it fulfilled in a way that'll probably not get them a happily ever after. 

00:28:20
NANCY BUCK Or a temporary happily, cause there already is a best drug dealer in the high school, and it might be that kid. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Temporary but you're going for permanent. Well I wanna thank you for talking about happily ever after. I learned some things. I hope other people did too. It was a pleasure to have you here Doctor Buck. And if you're interested in more of Doctor Buck's talks and other therapy talks, please check out the website at Alexander Street Press.
