ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care practice. Today's practice is Freedom Through Creativity. When we hold ourselves back and shut down, we reinforce rigidity and keep ourselves from fully embracing all that life has to offer. Remember, experiencing a trauma is not a reason to reject everything from today and into the future. Find a creative outlet to start to release all that's inside of you. It's crucial to find something that you really are fully committed to doing, poorly act. Yes, that's correct, if you think you're terrible at something, but it interests you or appeals to you even slightly, that's fine. The perfect recipe for this exercise is to find something that you have no necessary skill for. Let's practice. One, write, draw, paint, dance, sculpt, bead, tell stories or whatever it is, just choose something. Just do this without any expectation of perfection of any degree. Simply do something that allows for a creative outlet with no expectation of outcome. That's it, just choose something. Then notice how you feel. And make a note of it. Then do some more of the creative thing that you've chosen, whatever it is. Again just reflect on how you feel. Rather than the outcome being the focus of your attention, just allow yourself to immerse yourself in the activity without any judgment. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or to calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step, in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from The Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
