Jay Haley on Strategic Therapy 1978 

00:00:00
An interview by Richard Rabkin, MD 

00:00:00
RICHARD RABKIN Today, we have with us Jay Haley, the author of Problem Solving Therapy. We're all pretty much in agreement that the- I don't know if I'll say it right, but the job after the initial beginning of therapy, let's skip all that since this is the last session, is to prescribe some sort of a task a directive. That seems to be to be one of the most difficult aspects of therapy, at least to me to know what to do and . . . 

00:01:10
JAY HALEY Don't know how to do it is more important than what to do. But I tend to be very simple about tasks, if... Any symptom just about can be solved, if you can make it harder on the person to have this symptom than to give it up. And if you follow that simple principle, then the only question is what can you arrange that's harder on the person? Like Erikson with a kid that picks at his sore on his forehead , has the kid write that he shouldn't do that, and improves handwriting in the process of writing. It's the same principle... But a woman like that, you could also, and here's what we do a lot of them really, is draw her out on what she should do more of. She should do more exercising , she should do more reading or whatever. And then you set up an ordeal in the middle of the night, where she , everyday that she does this, that night she gets up at two in the morning, and does an hours exercising. If that isn't enough you make it two hours, you make the exercising more severe. The certain point this is harder on her than this procedure and she'd give it up. Is the general principle, I've had this work on so many complex symptoms that it seems like such a simple thing but it is. 

00:02:20
RICHARD RABKIN Yeah well that's, you know that's kind of aversive punishing thing that's disguised. It's cleverly kind of disguised. 

00:02:30
JAY HALEY That's OK. Not so disguised. You should always say to the person, I know you like to sleep through because I enjoy a good night's sleep myself. But I'd like you to get up at two in the morning, so when they get up at two in the morning, they're thinking of you sacked out. 

00:02:45
RICHARD RABKIN [laughs]Which makes it worse. 

00:02:45
JAY HALEY So it's part of the relationship with you is what it's there for. 

00:02:50
RICHARD RABKIN Yeah that's what I wanted to bring up, because as you're describing it, it's not really within a context. And I'd be curious to know what you think about that in a sense that it's a way of introducing the punishment, and a lot of behaviors. I think would see that in a digital sort of way. And you've just added a wrinkle to it in a sense that there's a- there's something happening between the therapist and the patient. 

00:03:25
JAY HALEY True. I tend not to think in learning theory, myself. So I don't think of it as a conditioning process, or an aversive process. I tend to think of it as a shift in the relationship with the therapist process. So it's, in a way it's a different way of thinking , it isn't as coherent a theory as the learning theory people, I think. 

00:03:45
RICHARD RABKIN You know, I had a case of a- a boy wasn't wanting to study a lot. Wasn't studying and he also told me that he used to have weights and he thought it was important to work out. So that's a sitting duck, I mean, if he doesn't study, he lifts weights. And he wound up getting straight A's, and possibly muscles but I don't know. But, and he bought that for some reason. 

00:04:10
JAY HAYLEY Well what's nice about that procedure is it went either way. If they have the symptom they exercise more, which is what they want. If they don't have the symptom, they're getting over the symptom, which is what they want. So...It's another way to think of it I think. 

00:04:20
RICHARD RABKIN I did not know they had to get up at two in the morning and do it, but that's a- 

00:04:25
JAY HALEY It's nice to make it like a nightmare in the middle of the night. And it's important that they get up, that they go to sleep first and go to sleep afterwards, for some of these problems. 

00:04:35
RICHARD RABKIN Do you have any idea why ? 

00:04:40
JAY HALEY Just a law of life, of some kind.[laughs] I just, some people will then stay up and do it, and that's OK. But they don't- you try to make it later in the night so they have to go to sleep. You want them to feel it in their body the next day. Then they're thinking about being anxious. I've seen a woman so anxious that her hands perspired, dripped water. And with an ordeal like this , they just stopped. It was a physical change. 

00:05:05
RICHARD RABKIN What was the task that was . . . 

00:05:10
JAY HALEY Well she thought that she should do more housework, so the task was to get up in the middle of the night, two in the morning and scrub the kitchen floor, scrub the bathroom. 

00:05:20
RICHARD RABKIN If her hands were- 

00:05:25
JAY HALEY Any day that she was, what you do is you make it any day that you're more anxious than you consider normal, you have to do this. So then it gets into a real fine line, is this normal or abnormal, my anxiousness today? But, she also was to think about how this would make this a more pleasant house for her husband, while she did this. And she was furious that her husband is- [laughs] So it made more of an ordeal, and she went through a very rapid transformation. This kind of a thing, when it works well, produces remarkable changes in people. And they all sort of get very intensely involved with you, so you have to be able to tolerate that... If you use these procedures. 

00:06:00
RICHARD RABKIN Intensely involved in, how does that . . . 

00:06:00
JAY HALEY Well they get mad at you or happy with you, or angry with you, you're on their mind. 

00:06:10
RICHARD RABKIN Can you think of a task like that, just to finish it off, with kids that- have you ever done anything with . . . 

00:06:15
JAY HALEY Sure I did a nice one with a 16-year-old bedwetter. 17 year old, he was about to leave home, which was the problem at the time I think. But, I had him clock a mile on his car, and then get up in the night, if he woke up with a wet bed he had to get up and get out of that wet bed, walk that mile which was good exercise, he thought he should exercise. Come back and get in that wet bed again. If he slept through the night and woke up with a wet bed, he had to set the alarm for the next night and do this. And in about, oh, ten days I think it was, this just became less, he'd been doing it every night, it just became less and less and vanished. And his father and mother appeared saying they had problems they'd like to do with it. That is- this was at a period when I was in practice getting people over problems with brief therapy, and only beginning to notice that if you produced a change in a person, there was a reaction in other people in the family. Which is what got me into working with families, it wasn't any theory or something. It was the observation that families kept appearing if you make a rapid change. And most people in those days didn't know that, because the therapy was so ineffective, that you didn't produce enough of a change to activate a [??] but if you did a very directed procedure you got action. And it took a while to notice that there was a connection between what you were doing. As I would work with the wife, and she would get over something, and the husband would come in and I would think when I solve something in the wife and the husband now wants something solved, without seeing a connection between the fact of I'd solved something with the wife, brought the husband- that was a- seems odd now but that was a very hard connection to make in those days . . . 

00:07:55
RICHARD RABKIN Have you, can you think of something with a younger . . . How about bout a school? Have you ever done something like a school phobia, someone won't go to school or anything? 

00:08:05
JAY HALEY No I deal with those strictly in terms of hierarchy in the family. 

00:08:05
RICHARD RABKIN How do you deal with them? 

00:08:10
JAY HALEY Parents, by god, get that kid to school. There's a standard set of procedures to get a- for school phobias that we use, that involves the family. And the kid has no choice in the matter except to get to school really. 

00:08:25
RICHARD RABKIN You kind of worked that out along different lines. 

00:08:30
JAY HALEY See I . . .Let me, maybe it would help a little bit to say that I think in three's. I move from working and thinking in one's to thinking in twos, to thinking in threes. So if I hear of a problem I always tend to look for two people that are involved in this problem besides the person who has the problem. And if won't go to school, I assume it's a mother/father/kid problem, or mother/boyfriend/kid, or mother/grandmother/kid or- so I wouldn't just work with the kid in that. I might only interview the kid, but I would be thinking of how the parents are involved in it. 

00:09:00
RICHARD RABKIN And what would your guess be about the type of problem among the three? 

00:09:10
JAY HALEY You know I don't know, they're so similar. The way you find out what the problem is, is by getting a change. I don't think you ever find it out by conversation with families. So as you tell the parents this kid has to go to school, they agree. And you set a date for them to start school, you make sure he has a school he can go to. And then you anticipate with the parents and they say there's a wild scene trying to get him to go to school, he won't go to school. So you say what are you going to do to handle this? With the boy present. You talk about what if he gets up and he won't get out of bed, what do you do? What if he won't get dressed, who's going to dress him? What if he vomits and says he's sick? And often it's good to have a physician involved because kids often do that, and you have them examined and the physician says to the parents, by god, if this kid vomits he's still OK. Because the parents, you don't want them to hesitate at the moment. Now really what you're working on is the relationship between the parents, you're not really concerned about getting the kid to school, and that's- you ought to really get to school. But if the parents pull together to get him to school, you resolved whatever's going on between the parents, and you don't find out often what it is. Sometimes you do find out that the- like you'll find a typical problem, the mother's more educated than father. So if the kid goes to school he tends to violate a coalition with his father, if he doesn't go to school he tends to violate a coalition with his mother. So he doesn't go to school but he shows himself very bright. Or he goes to school half the time, would be a possible hypothesis. But whatever the explanation of it, whatever the function of it, the procedure is just the same. Get the parents to pull together, get that kid to school. And if they- if he won't go to school, they take him there. If he runs away when he gets to school, one of them sits with him the whole day, and they do this everyday and he stays in school. And you just absolutely block off the kid not going to school as a solution to whatever it was in the family, and then whatever comes up, you deal with. There's a nice paper by Henry Burger, out of Philadelphia, on school phobias. Which, essentially describes this proceedure. 

00:11:05
RICHARD RABKIN There in your book I noticed you said that one of the best ways to design a task, is around symptom itself. 

00:11:15
JAY HALEY Sure. 

00:11:15
RICHARD RABKIN And could you tell us a little bit about how that would work. 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY I think . . . I do a therapy which is entirely symptom oriented, or problem oriented. I don't realize how extreme it is. I just give a work shop out in the West Coast where they're all experiential out there, and they're having lots of experiences. And for them to formulate a problem, is difficult because they don't think in problems. They would think of a kid not going to school, they would think of the process of the mother and the father and the kid, if they thought in threes but they tend not to. In terms of something about their relationships, and they would make interpretations have them come together, have them bring out their feelings about each other on the asumption the kid would go to school if these things happened. If you talk to them about focusing on the problem of not going to school, or focusing on whatever other problem the family brings in , they're puzzled really, it's odd to them. It isn't odd to families, you know I did an outcome study in Philadelphia, which I never published, which was a very simple one. We'd took every family that came in for two months, and we asked the family members what the problem was. And then after therapy we asked them if they got over the problem. But in the process of asking the family members what the problem was, they could specify, quite concretely, in about 80 percent of the cases, what the problem was. The kid won't go to school, the kid won't mind, or the kid has these anxiety spells, or the kid runs away. Whereas the therapist, when we were interested in seeing if therapists and families were in agreement about the problem, the mother would say the daughter runs away all the time, the therapist would say there's a problem with individuation, and you don't know whether these are the same problem. You know? Because they're different languages. But at any rate usually if the therapist will listen to the family, they'll specify the problem. Although we have to train therapists, also, how to- for those families that don't specify, to bring it out. Then the whole therapy is around that problem, and then you have people that are very motivated and involved with you, interested. If you talk to them about how the [??] meaning represents something else, they couldn't care less usually. They're in there to get over whatever they're paying their money to get over. 

00:13:30
RICHARD RABKIN And, now, what's a typical task around the problem? Whatever, how would you- 

00:13:40
JAY HALEY Well for example I have a woman who won't leave the house. She panicked, she had this 20 years. And the task is to have her husband take her as far each day, as she can go, and to keep extending that. The assumption is that the problem is lodged in with her husband. Actually it seems- maybe I better clarify something else. I have certain clinical assumptions which may or may not be true. But they're the best thing for therapists to think. That a research idea is the different order of ideas. I think it's best to assume that a woman that won't leave the house, there's a problem with her husband about her leaving the house. Now it may not be true always, or it may not be the best way to think of it for some other purpose. For therapy it's the best, I've cured a lot of women with this problem, by putting their husbands in charge. And then the husbands will let the women go as far as the husband can tolerate. And you're working with the husband extensively on helping the wife go far. They're actually working on the husband tolerating the wife going out without him. Where is she going to go, what is she going to do? So I would put the husband in charge, we'd start the session since I like to bring a problem into the session, by the therapist having a woman go round the block while he talks to the husband to see how far she can go. You know, as a baseline to begin. She gets halfway around the block, she comes back. We can watch the husband on how uneasy is he when she's gone, and he isn't very uneasy, so this looks pretty good. But at the same time, since the woman's had a lot of therapy for this problem, and had it for many years, it sounds too easy to them that the husband is just going to get her to go so far. So we'll put her through a walking proceedure where she makes a list of anxiety and hierarchies and have her relaxed and so on, so that the husband has a reason for pushing her farther, because she's going through this procedure which will help her get over the problem. They need something visible that'll help them- help her get over the problem, so that they can get over the problem. So we will give a walking task in that, is one I can think of at the moment. 

00:15:40
RICHARD RABKIN Ok. Ok. So what you're doing is you're involving another family member in the therapy, in a sense. 

00:15:45
JAY HALEY Always. 

00:15:45
RICHARD RABKIN When they're, if it's a kid then you have a mother and a father. That's a . . . do you, have a general way of going, of choosing which one? 

00:15:55
JAY HALEY Well as a standard procedure it's a Little Hans case in there, which you take the peripheral parent and put them in charge. And then you get some action between the two parents if the if the peripheral parent stays in charge. It's usually the father, it could be the mother. But if the mother is very involved with the kid, you put the father in charge of the kid doing something, as he does it the mother jumps on him. See, this is a therapy too, another way to put it is that it's a therapy of sequences. [??] in there in which the typical sequence is the mother and son get very involved, say, and the kid gets into difficulty, mother calls upon father to help, father starts to help, mother says my god that's not the way to help and expels him. So he backs off and withdraws, so mother and son get very involved with each other at a certain point says this is too much for me, calls upon father too help. He starts to do something, mother says, or son says that's not the way to do this, so he backs off. And that sequence goes on forever and ever and ever. And this is a therapy to break up that sequence. It isn't to change the mother or the father or the child, it's to stop that sequence from happening. One of the ways to stop it is to have father start to do something with the child, and hold him there. So that when mother jumps on him he continues to deal with the child, then you're into the marital issues, and the child is free and goes along his business. And then you only have the problem getting the therapist out of it. 

00:17:20
RICHARD RABKIN You would do this in any session, any- in the session. Would you say go home and do it or would you try and . . . 

00:17:25
JAY HALEY Oh no, you send them home with the task, always. 

00:17:25
RICHARD RABKIN You send them home with the task. 

00:17:30
JAY HALEY And you try to find a way of putting father and child without putting mother down. I'm a great believer in courtesy therapy, where you try not to antagonize anybody. 

00:17:35
RICHARD RABKIN All right. 

00:17:40
JAY HALEY For example you look for something that father can do that mother can't. Like now this boy is 12 years old and a male, and therefore he needs a father. And mother can't argue with that, you know? Or you find something in father's work. Like we had a kid who was very anxious and would climb into bed with the parents so often, that father moved to the couch, and the kid slept with mom, because he had such anxiety in the night. So the therapist puts father in charge of the problem, and the way he does it was the father was a security guard, and the therapist said since you're an expert on security, I want you when it's bedtime to take this kid around and make sure that- with him, that every window and every door in that house is locked. Then when he's reassured that house is perfectly safe, then you put him in his own bed and see if he stays in his own bed. The mother couldn't protest this, because she wasn't a security guard. The father knew all about security, now naturally when you put the boy in his own bed, father gets in bed with mother, then you're into those issues. Which is the next stage of the therapy, but you need a way to get to those issues gracefully, and that's one way to do it. I thought that was clever to think of him as a security guard, but that's . . . 

00:18:50
RICHARD RABKIN Now, so, that in a way is courteous to the mother in a sense, by finding something special about the father. So in an anorexic, you'd say well your father's had more experience in restaurants or something, and you'd take the . . . 

00:19:05
JAY HALEY Well there are certain problems where I wouldn't use this procedure. 

00:19:05
RICHARD RABKIN All right, I'm just trying to . . . 

00:19:10
JAY HALEY Well let me clarify, with crazy kids, or nutty ones, violent ones, dope addicts, severe anorectics, I don't think it's a problem with one of the parents being more involved. They're both so involved, that what you do is work with both of them at once, so you make both parents feed the kids, is the way I'd tend to work with anorectics, or any extreme case. Because otherwise what you find is you put the peripheral person in charge and then you find they're not peripheral really they are as involved as they other one and they thrash about. So we do a lot of just straight forward the two parents have to reach agreement about how to get this kid to eat. 

00:19:45
RICHARD RABKIN All right and you don't care about where they're stuffing food in the mouth or anything like that. 

00:19:55
JAY HALEY No. You know there was a case, I don't know, why don't you talk about the kid who wouldn't anything except fruit without seeds. He had a boy anorectic, a 16 year old, long haired kid who was starving and the only food he would eat is fruit without seeds, which there's not much of. 

00:20:15
RICHARD RABKIN I can, can you name a banana. 

00:20:15
JAY HALEY Yeah. (laughing) Seedless grapes, he ate. That's right. He made a list on the board I forgot what they were. But he was dying because he was just wasting away, and it's unusual to have a male interact. And what Minuchin did out of a conference that I was involved in, deciding what to do, it's a nice example. Minuchin likes to produce a crisis, and this sure did. What he did was say, you know it's an interesting example to me, because another therapist came and interviewed this family that day, because they happened to be there. And the therapist did an interesting interview. In which he brought all the things about death in the family the father liked to do grave rubbings, mother worked in a museum, the father was a pacifist and opposed to any kind of war or whatever. Which is one of the reasons his kid wouldn't eat anything that could harm him. They were a very sweet, nice family and this therapist did a very lovely interview about death. And then the staff watched and then talked to them afterwards, and some of the staff said what would you do now? And he said well I would do another interview bringing out these things. So they said what else would you do, what would you do after you brought out these things? And he said well I would bring out these things further. He had absolutely nothing to do, really, except to talk about the problem. And what Minuchin did, was saying that starting that day, that was a Friday, nobody- that was the two parents and the healthy siblings and this kid. Nobody in the family could eat anything except what this kid ate. And therefore, and he sold them they're a very nice family, very- they do their very best for their child, they talk about giving the cook the weekend off- it was a wealthy family. They had to empty the refrigerator when they went home, and he had the boy list on the board what they could eat, which was fruit without seeds, there wasn't much. So they did, they went home and they emptied the refrigerator, got rid of the cook, and by the next day they were hungry, and they were getting madder and madder. And mother and father had big fight, the father made an attempt at suicide of a sort, and by the next day the kid was eating and everybody else was eating. And this is a way of inducing a crisis with the task, in order to get a remarkable change, and that kid began to straighten up. Another thing Minuchin did that was interesting to that family, is he didn't- the kid was very unsocial and withdrawn. He didn't wait for the kid to make friends, he hired a 15 year old to be co-therapist, to take him around to the coffee shops, and introduce him to people, and it was about a month later that the parents began to protest about this kid coming in late, you know, which you're suppose to be doing at that age. But a lot of people we just wait for something to happen... 

00:22:55
RICHARD RABKIN Well that's a very- those are very practical, I mean the, taking the- hiring a kid is very practical kind of- but see, the task of creating a crisis though, it's hard to see the structure that generates that sort of a task, which is, you know, where does it come from? 

00:23:15
JAY HALEY We just make it harder on them to not solve the problem, to solve the problem. 

00:23:20
RICHARD RABKIN All right, maybe that's it. 

00:23:20
JAY HALEY (laughing) Simple as that. They couldn't eat 'til the kid ate. 

00:23:25
RICHARD RABKIN Yeah, if you wanted a candy bar he had to eat a candy bar. So you got to get him to eat the candy bar. 

00:23:30
JAY HALEY The whole task is to get them to do it, that's where the outcome is. 

00:23:30
RICHARD RABKIN Well . . . I think that too really, I think the art of thinking up this task also requires- there's something to it, I agree that . . . 

00:23:40
JAY HALEY Well you do find . . . I use to in my early days with Eric, I would say how come you can think of a thing like that? But as you do it, it becomes easier. He use to say well it's obvious you know? And I said well it's not obvious, and over time it becomes- see one of the things, if you come out of non-directive therapy, or inside therapy, You're not forced to think of tasks. Because you tell people what's happening and say I wonder why you did that, and hope they get over it, you know. If the burden is on you to get them over it, and you don't use inside because you don't think it's effective, then you've got to come up with something else, and under that pressure you do. A non directive therapist, giving a task- it's funny to watch them when you try to train them. Because I wonder if you thought of the possibility of perhaps under certain circumstances- See another thing about this is the therapy I do has no relation to theory of repression. So there is nothing inside people that you have to bring out, therefore you do confrontation, there's nothing that you have to bring out, there's nothing that they have to be aware of in their unconcience or something like that. So you don't do any confronting unless it's absolutely for a strategic reason, to block something off, or to make something happen for a very calculated purpose, it isn't for a theory like you find on the West Coast that confrontation and bringing out the emotions will change people. I've just seen too many years of people doing therapy where it didn't. 

00:25:00
RICHARD RABKIN Well let's see if we could- there's some way of- if we say that thinking of these skills is a- thinking of these tasks a [??] is skill...You're always doing it with the family there. I think, you don't have any game that you play, like what would you do with something like that and everybody go around the room and think of something . . . 

00:25:30
JAY HALEY No. Well, it's good to have a task. Sometimes we'll say to the parents, I'm sure you had an impulse to do something, that you didn't do. What was that? And they'll come up with something. And we go with that, if you can go with a patient of the family with one of their ideas and their tasks, I always do it, because then they have more invested in it because it's theirs. There's another thing about it though that may make a difference, if people just tell you about a patient or a problem, it's hard to think of a task. One of the nice things about live observation is that when you're supervising, the ideas of what might be done come to you from watching the family deal with each other because you see the process of what's happening. And often I've started a supervision or an interview without having any idea what kind of task for the therapist to do, and we try to plan before the session and I haven't thought of anything, and then as soon as you see them start dealing with each other, then you begin to get ideas of what to do. And then the therapist you can call them up and talk about it, and suggest it, or suggest it on the phone or whatever. 

00:26:25
RICHARD RABKIN Do you ever have a long conference between the observation and the task, or- 

00:26:30
JAY HALEY Well it depends on the therapist really, since a lot of the emphasis is on how to give it rather than just a task, with a second [??] I just call them and suggest it and they go ahead with it, it's almost like plan b, sort of, you know. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN What you've been talking about is the task you've assigned was some how or other incorporated [??] that involves [??] I haven't really heard you go into the business of how you give it, which I would think would be with the resistance or patient's investment in the symptom or family's investment. Could you comment about that? The real tricks, I suppose, of the trade. 

00:27:10
JAY HALEY The basic trade for it is hypnosis, I think, and when people don't learn hypnosis they lose all that skill. Because in hypnosis you ask people to do something, you motivate them, you suggest they do something, you watch their response, you correct your suggestion, this is the process of hypnosis. You also learn to be very specific, if you want somebody to levitate an arm, and you say your arm will get lighter, and lighter, and feel like lifting up, then you wait, it'll never lift up. Because you only said it'll feel like lifting up, so you have to say it'll feel like lifting up, and then it will lift up. And that kind of precision you'll learn in hypnosis I think it's pretty good training...But other than that, you motivate people to- you say you'd like to get over the- we do a thing like I've been teaching therapists how to talk about change. Like, would you like to get over this problem very quickly, or a step at a time? And either way they're accepting they're going to get over the problem, which is a hypnotic device. You say would you like to realize you're getting over the problem, or have it happen and then notice the problem's gone? A therapist should be able to talk 20 minutes about how the person would like to have this change happen. And in the process of that, you've explored with them all kinds of things, in the way they think, and they talk, and they deal with you so that it's easier to think about how to give them the task. You often give people a task in a room. If you're going to have the parents and the kid do something, one of the things you ask them to do is to talk together, to see if they just talk together when you ask them. If they don't, then you think about this may be more difficult task. You ask somebody to move, the way they move tells you, what are they going to do something outside of the room? That is you have them practice, you have them do something in the room to give you an indication of whether they'd do it outside of the room. But generally you just help people reasonably directed to do it, you tell them what you want them to do, then you summarize for them what you told them often, then you ask them to repeat it back if there's any question about it. Often you say to them, I'd like you to talk about what you might get out of doing this. And they've already thought of two or three by the time you've told them the task. And if they bring those up, those are blocked off usually, so the odds are going- We've got a- I've got a- nice little film, which I haven't finished yet, of one of my therapists. A kid- an eight year old boy came in, who had busted his teachers nose, and put her in the hospital overnight with a concussion, and he was just a little blonde kid about this high his name is Dennis, and his father wears horn rimmed glasses, and his mothers a blonde, and this kid has temper tantrums at home, is wild, wrecks the house, and has quite a bit of trouble at school, including this one. The therapist, they, the parents came in to talk about the problem, and talk about how helpless they were about the problem. We decided to give the parents this task of putting the kid in his room for ten minutes, time out behavior procedure, the task was relatively simple, you can solve this problem if every time this kid starts a temper tantrum you put him in his room. To get the parents to do that, when they feel so helpless is a real problem. And what I've been trying to do is make a little film on the various things the therapist did to motivate the parents. But one thing she just said to the parents, you have to do this, you have to solve this, you can't just have the kid go on like this, you've got to do something. Are you willing to do something? And the parents say well, that's why we're here. Actually that isn't why they were there, they were there to talk about the problem. Well when they're pinned they've got to do something. So then she says, this is a very bright little boy, and she doesn't just put down the kid, she compliments him, in terms of what a challenge he is to try to deal with. And then she asks them to find a space in the house, like his room, or bathroom or somewhere. They don't have any room in the house, but they could use his room. And she wants them to put him in his room the father says he won't go to his room, when I tell him. So she says well we'll deal with that later let's first find out where is the room? And does it have a good lock on the door? And she gets the father all involved in the door, and the lock on the door. When it gets to the time of putting him in his room, she says the two of them could do that. But the problem is what if father isn't there? Can mother do it? Then you talk to mother about, is there a neighbor? And there's a girl down the street that only weighs 90 pounds but she could help if it had to be done. And the parents bring up a whole series of objections, the therapist counters each one with a practical solution to them, she sends them home at the end of that first session, to do this task. Put that kid- and the kid is in the room of course, and he says he's going to- you don't mind if I break down the door do you? And the father says we'll get another door. And earlier the father had said the problem is the kid will break down the door, and the kid said why don't you get a metal door. [laughs] So he's participating in this, but at any rate the therapist sent them home, she did a great selling job, sent them home to do it. When they came in for the next session a week later, I said to the therapist, now don't be too hard on them if they haven't done this. They've had this problem quite a while, it's a difficult problem, for them to pull together must be hard. She says OK, and she goes in there, and they've solved it. The kid started the temper tantrum, and the mother held the door, carried him up there, threw him in the room, held the door for half an hour. 'Til finally she sent somebody for father who came, put a better lock on it. The kid broke up everything in the room, and they emptied the room. They did it about three times, the problem was over. And there was one or two more sessions, and then the therapist came in and had two families scheduled at once inadvertently, so she saw this one, heard everything was going well, said why don't you take the fee for the day, go out for dinner, and that's it. Then she handled them on the phone and found out things were going all right, then we did the six months follow up which I'm tagging on this film, and that was it, that was the therapy. A very difficult problem solved very rapidly by just getting his parents to do it. In the process the parents had to pull together and whatever difficulties they were having, this kid was caught between, they resolved in this. It was one of the cases where you didn't have a marital difficulty after the kid improved, which is what you usually have and sometimes you don't. So you have to anticipate that... that's an example of a simple task, only the problem is getting carried out. 

00:33:25
RICHARD RABKIN What about paradoxical tasks, which is- You mentioned this book you...were writing a book on, have you- is that near completion or- 

00:33:35
JAY HALEY No, I'm in the middle of writing it. 

00:33:35
RICHARD RABKIN In the middle of writing it. 

00:33:40
JAY HALEY I'm writing it with my wife and we're struggling over some of it. Just finding the time is a problem... but we do a whole therapeutic procedure, I think that para- paradox almost always works. Or certainly produces remarkable changes, if it's done at all well. And I don't- the only time I think it's counter indicated is when you have someone who's crazy, and it's not because they're so fragile, it's because they're so skillful, that if you use a paradox with them, they'll do you in. They toy with you with paradox- they've lived with this for a long time. So often they'll cooperate, but it tends to give you the feelikng afterwards, I'm sorry I did that. You know, they're very skillful people, I tend to think that anybody who's defined as schizophrenic or who is- speaks in metaphor is more skillful than any therapist or the average therapist, and they should be treated with great respect, and treated very simply. Like people ought to go to work, make a living. They ought to go to school, you can't beat simplicity, but anything complex they'll beat you. Now there are some exceptions like Madam Palatolli[SP] in Milan uses paradox, but she does it in special circumstances. Like she'll see a family, and then she won't see them for a month, so they can't undo what she's doing, because she isn't seeing them often enough. So there's certain ways she can do it, but it takes- the average therapist, I don't think, should use paradox with anybody who's crazy, and so we don't. A master can do it. But except for that, but the average run of the mill problems, and it makes a fun therapy in many ways so- 

00:35:15
RICHARD RABKIN How would you describe, how one goes about creating a paradox or task? Is there- 

00:35:20
JAY HALEY When you always do it, you try to set up exactly the problem they come in with. If it's for an individual, it's exactly the symptomatic behavior. If it's for a family it's the exacted sequence they follow, and then you prescribe that, you may not get there immediately. I've got a nice little film that is fresh in my mind because I was looking at that many years ago. It's called Only On Sunday, and it's a film with a ten year old boy, who's a compulsive masturbator, to the point where he wore a hole in the crotch of his pants and had blood in his urine. He had several years of therapy, including therapy with a guy I know, who's a reasonably competent man, and tried everything he could think of, and nothing worked. So when he came to us, we did a paradoxal procedure, which was a- and I made the film to show the stages of this, because what you do is you clarify, the first thing you do is you clarify a [??] thinking, what your goal is. Because if you use an effective method of therapy you're liable to get there. you know, so you'd better be very specific in it. And in this one, we didn't want this boy, to be prevented from masturbating, we wanted him prevented from masturbating in public. Which he was doing at school, and in his living room, and without pleasure. So we had to specify what we're after, and then the therapist went to work with him and the mother and the daughter and setup a paradox with him alone, took the problem, said to the mother, I want to deal with this problem, now you stay out of it. But at the same time, dealt with the mother, and it's a procedure- one of the ways if you- there's two ways to deal with paradoxes in families. One is to deal with an individual, and handle the family so they can tolerate the improvement. The other way is to use a paradox for the whole family. But if you- in this case, for example, the therapist says to the mother, that when the boy gets over the- she'd asked once the boy get over the problem, when she- when the boy gets over the problem, she's going to get upset...and the mother doesn't like this idea. I've done it often with couples. You say to the wife, when your husband gets over this problem, you're going to be upset, and she'll say I won't I tried for years to get him over this problem. And you say I know you think you won't get upset, but you'll get upset. Sometimes you say, well consciously you think you won't get upset, but what you're trying to do, is arrange it so nothing that she says will convince you. The only thing that will convince you, is if the person gets over the problem, and she doesn't get upset. So then she'll try to get him over the problem, and you have her working at home to get over the problem, and you're working in the office and you're collaborating. So with this mother, she was advised that she would get upset when the kid became normal. The therapist had trouble with this because he was a community therapist who didn't believe that a mother would get upset when her kid improved, you know? And so he had a little trouble getting this over, but he did it. And then he had the boy make a baseline of how often he masturbated, and then the boy said he enjoyed it. And then they asked him have you had it all week, and he did it more on Sunday. He asked him if he enjoyed it more on Sunday. The boy said he did and then he began to move it all to Sunday. That since he enjoyed it more on Sunday he had to do it about eight times on Sunday. Then he had to do it more elaborately, in a way he had to take his clothes off, and moved them and all this. And then since he sucked his thumb and wanted to get over that, if he sucked his thumb, that was one more time he had to do it on Sunday. And the masturbation, instead of the boy with all these people trying to get him to stop masturbating, the boy was in a position of being pushed to masturbate and beginning to rebel against it, which is what you're after with a paradox procedure. So then the boy cut down his masturbation, he didn't keep the track of the paper, came in very cheerfully, hadn't done what he should, the therapist was very hard on him and said that starting that week the boy had to masturbate everyday in the living room everyday in front of his parents. In front of his mother and his sisters. And he had to do it on Monday, he had to do it on Tuesday, and he had to do it right on time. And it sounds hard except that's what the boy was doing anyhow, which tends to be what you do. We have a woman who's a vomiter, she'd have to vomit and it sounds like my god, you're making this poor woman vomit, and she's vomiting anyhow... So the boy did that, then we gave him a week without any instructions, and went up on it, and that was essentially the problem. He did a little more, stopped it, and that was it. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN How do you do that with a family which is sending [??] systems of communication and a lot of family secrets? [??] a schizophrenic, there is such a family, where perhaps there's a psycho somatic illness and some kind of illness in the family. And you want to open up the secrets, can you use paradoxal or- what kind of work can you do to change communication patterns. So that instead of keeping them (inaudible ) you could do something to open them up? Or is that even possible? 

00:40:30
JAY HALEY If the goal is to bring on secrets, or you want to focus on secrets, you encourage them to have a secret...And you lay out a- who's to have a secret, who's to try and find it, and who can this person tell but not to who else, and in the process of that they'll talk about the way they handle secrets in there, and then you have them do that and change it, you see. It's- it depends on whether that's what you want to do. That is I'm not an enthusiast for feeling all the secrets in the family have to come out, but if it's a problem that- secrets are a problem, then that's the way to do it. But that is an example, you take whatever they're doing and ask them to do that, you know? 

00:41:00
RICHARD RABKIN You also, you're also making a point that you don't then say, aha I was just kidding, you're a paradoxical thing, and isn't it wonderful? You have to keep your . . . 

00:41:10
JAY HALEY Well often when you get it improved, what you say to people well they seem to be over this and I don't know quite why. And you do this to get out from under it yourself, so that you're not the cause of the change, because then they don't relapse in relation to you. If you say I caused it, then they can relapse in relation to you, show you by god you're not so great, or whatever they might want to show you. But if it's their solution, or you're puzzled by it, then there's no point in them relapsing, so they tend to persist in the improvement. 

00:41:40
RICHARD RABKIN So now how do you end the therapy on those circumstances? 

00:41:45
JAY HALEY Well let me say this, some people feel a problem in this in terms of that you're being insincere, or that you're being manipulative, and it doesn't bother me at all to be insincere and manipulative. I don't think you should lie to people, but if you're doing a paradoxical procedure, your problem is that in the wider framework you want them to get over the problem. Within that framework you want them to do what you say and be miserable that day. They didn't be miserable that day, so you focus on them not cooperating at that level, even though at the larger level you want them to not be miserable, you know? And that discrepancy doesn't bother me, it does bother some people...If they- this, by the way, has nothing to do with awareness, you can tell people what you're doing. I don't think it's quite as effective but I've had many fellow professionals come in when I was in practice and say would you do one of those paradoxes on me? And I would say sure, set up a paradox, they go through it and as long as they go through with what you say they're over the problem. There's nothing to do with them knowing what you're doing, that is you're not secretely doing something, in that sense. 

00:42:50
RICHARD RABKIN Yeah but in a lot of paradoxes that you point out, of course you really changing me with behavior, on a simple level you say to someone, masturbate more on Sundays, there is actually a change in addition to the change of you know, doing something deliberately. 

00:43:10
JAY HALEY Well I had a guy come to me, you know the first time I ever tried this I began to figure out that- that's what Erikson was doing, when I was in practice and I was consulting him. And I had a man come to me, who had headaches, or pressure in the head for seven years, and he'd been married seven years, and I made the connection, and I made more sophisticated. So I did see his wife, and set up this arrangement where she'd get upset when he improved. But except for that I did absolutely nothing but encourage this guy to have his headache. I- to have his headache. I put him in a trance, I was using hypnosis, and I put him in a trance suggesting the headaches get worse, so that he'd really experience it fully, well whatever and he said it's getting a little bit better. So I knew this would work with him so I just began to set up a series of times when he was this headache, starting with a short time, then a longer time, then a relapse, and that's all. That is- I did this the first time as just an experiment, because usually you do so many other things, while you're also doing something. But you can just pick one thing and only do that, and I was very impressed with the change in this guy. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN What happened with the marital relationship? 

00:44:20
JAY HALEY The wife came in, and told me she didn't get upset when her husband got better. He started taking her out, he started paying. He just sat for seven years, holding his head, this guy. He went to work and that's all. And what happened was that she came and told me she didn't get upset, they were getting along fine, they went away, in about two months they called me up and asked for marriage councelling. Because they hadn't worked out so much in their marriage because this guy spent all his town sitting holding his head, you know, and then we spent a couple of months on the marriage as I remember. 

00:44:55
RICHARD RABKIN One more type of task. You refer to metaphoric, I think, is that what- metaphoric task where the task is not directly related to the symptom. Do you use a lot of that or is it mostly Erikson that uses that? Well do you teach it, I mean is that- 

00:45:10
JAY HALEY Oh I would do it if I could do it well. He does it so well that- I tend to assume that if people tell you about a problem, sometimes they do it in a very indirect way, and then you can focus on that indirect way and have the courtesy not to make the problem explicit. That is if a couple comes in with a sexual problem, and they'd rather not talk about the sexual problem, would rather talk about something else, I would try to give them a task in relation to something else that would also solve the sexual problem. I don't think you have to force people to deal explicitly with what they'd rather not deal. In that sense it would be metaphorical, because they're going to express it in some other way too. 

00:45:50
RICHARD RABKIN Can you give us an example of . . . 

00:45:55
JAY HALEY I was just trying to think of one. Erikson does it with eating, he does a whole thing about having a meal together, that is so sexy in terms of how the wife is to prepare the meal, how the husband is to be involved in it. But . . . 

00:46:15
RICHARD RABKIN Whether to have the lights on or off? 

00:46:15
JAY HALEY On candlelight, on or off. Some husbands like to just dive into the meat and potatoes, some like to have appetizers first. And what's very important to him is that if the couple begins to connect it with sex, he takes it away from them. This is not to make them consciously aware that this is any way related to sex. It's- you failed if you make it explicit. This is an absolute like two languages you're talking to people.
