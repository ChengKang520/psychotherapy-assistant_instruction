DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit to help in your foundation moving you in the right direction with trauma recovery. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday building the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is: Expect moments of strain in your change cycle. Beginning to commit to your recovery after trauma is the first step on your journey. There are many steps to this journey and there will be time to we have (inaudible ). That's just normal, embrace those moments and then let them guide you to the next step in your recovery. Use them as an opportunity to ask yourself, what do I do now? What's my next step? What's missing from my recovery progress? There are normal stages related to any life change. Realizing this can help you alienate the burden of negative self-perception when you have setbacks in your recovery or change progress. Let's practice together. One, precontemplation occurs when we are not even fully aware of a problem, or we are not ready to consider what we might do in order to change. Two, contemplation occurs when we become aware of a problem and we are noticing it, but it's before we take the step to commit to real change. Three, preparation starts when we are ready because we hit our pain point and this engages our intent to form new strategies and plan to act on these plans change. Four action, action is the big step where we now apply our efforts towards changing our behaviors and our lives and this doesn't mean that we can just apply to change and then expect that everything's just going to be different and perfect. What it means is that, we are now moving in the right direction and we may need to retool and apply a lot of different strategies to get the results you want. Change if we identify it correctly, moves us towards a better place. But when we identify the discomfort we're ready to still work on, a problem that we are working through. So, keep focused on them. Five maintenance, at the maintenance stage, here we are and we are ready to try, to keep noticing what's happening, but we are actually doing pretty good. The strategies we selected they are really starting to take hold and we are forming new habits that are being successful everyday sustained over a period of time. Now, feels really good and now it starts to happen. Six, six is relapse, whoops! That honestly this happens to absolutely everyone and it's something we actually need to be prepared for because, then we can really understand that we can accept it and that this is simply a sign that we need to reapply our efforts on the finer strategies and commit to action. Don't give up. Just gets to teach it. Seven, precontemplation, this is when we are back in the same place again. Yep! We go through a cycle refining and redefining ourselves, examining, challenging and recreating ourselves through… throughout our lifetime. So, the ability to adapt, change and grow is what makes us uniquely human. Embrace it because, this is what opens up the possibilities of a lifetime. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
