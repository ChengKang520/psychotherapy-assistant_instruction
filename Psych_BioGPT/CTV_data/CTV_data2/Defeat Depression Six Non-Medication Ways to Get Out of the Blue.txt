BILL O'HANLON  Hi, this is Bill O’Hanlon, and welcome to everybody on the live webcast as well as the people who are watching on DVD or listening on the CD or from an audio download. So we’ve got a lot of stuff cover today. We’re going to be talking about non-medication ways to beat the blues and we’ll be talking about depression. We don’t have a lot of time to dwell on any one of these six. So we’re just going to move through them pretty quickly. There’s going to be no fad in this, it’s all going to be meat. So here we go, first thing, just to give you a little credibility, I’m a psychotherapist, been a psychotherapist for over 30 years, written over 30 books. Some of which had to do with depression. But I experienced depression when I was younger, so I know what it’s like to be in this terrible state. And that got me interested later on in my life. I got depressed and suicidal when I was a student at the university and later on when I became a therapist, I really was interested in helping people get out of depression. And medication works to a certain extent, works for some people, but it doesn’t solve all the problems of depression. So this presentation, what we’re going to be covering is challenging the myths of depression and giving you six alternative methods of helping people move out of depression whether they are on medication or not on medication. So first, let’s talk about these myths. The first myth, because drug companies want you to think this and because they do a lot of television commercials, they want you to think that we know that cause is genetic and biochemical and that is not known. There is still being debate in the field, what causes depression. So they’ll show you these little ads that show these molecules moving in the brain and that’s what causes depression, not necessarily so. Again, big debate in the field is what causes it. And to tell you that it’s genetic obviously everything is genetic to a certain extent, but I’ve given you some quotations on here. For most common diseases specific genes almost never cause it, they are an influence and it depends a lot more on your environment, its nature and nurture. So that anti-depressants are the only cheer for depression, it's one of the myths that’s out there. There have been some recent critics and some of the research oriented depressions and whether they work or not, I suspect they work and they work for – to certain extent and they work for certain people, but they don’t work for everybody, not everybody is willing to take them. And even if they do work, there are sometimes some side effects that keep people from getting the full benefit of them, they have to cut back, they have to try a different one. We know that anti-depressants aren’t the total answer. So that’s what this presentation offers, six different strategies, sorry, six different strategies for effective intervention and these are alternative approaches to the traditional approaches of just plainly cognitive therapy or medication therapy. So I want to play an audio for you of a guy who experienced depression, didn’t know what was happening. This guy’s name is Andrew Solomon. He wrote a book called The Noonday Demon after he recovered from his first bout of serious depression. And I couldn’t find a more pointedly description of what it felt like for me to go through it, what it feels like for generally, I mean, everybody has a slightly different experience. But I just want to play this three minute audio to give you a sense of what people go through with depression. 

00:03:40
ANDREW SOLOMON  I had my first really severe breakdown in about 1994. I had been going along about my life and I’ve been through some things that were quite traumatic and quite difficult, the most striking one being the death of my mother at the end of a long battle with cancer. And I was feeling very down and very blue and rather grief-stricken. I had some additional personal traumas. And then I began to feel really increasingly sad and then I began to feel sort of numb. And then I began to find that things were just a little bit effortful. And then I didn’t seem to be able to muster very much emotion about anything. And then things began to become more effortful and I'd get home I have messages on my answering machines and I would think, all those people, I need to call back all of those people. And I think I have to go out and I have to get things to eat and I have to get through the day. And it all seemed like somehow more than I could manage to do and I thought that was very strange, but I was still able to keep up wizard of functioning reasonably well and I assume that it was just a temporary thing and I didn’t really pay very much attention to it. And then it began to get more severe and I began to have this feeling of grid and anxiety, which was sort of like the feeling you might have if you would tripped into or about to fall that sort of middle of the air feeling before you quite hit the ground, but it was extended and this feeling of grid got worse and worse and I began coming and fearing messages on my answering machine and thinking not simply that I didn’t want to call people back. But I didn’t know how I ever could, I would think, who are those people, how am I ever going to catch up with them. What am I ever going to do? How am I going to – and they were just messages from friends and people who wanted to be in touch. And I would think I have to get dressed, I have to put on my clothes, I have to put on both socks, I have to put on both shoes and the whole business of ordinary daily life began to seem so effortful and so overwhelming. And I really didn’t understand what was happening to me, but I kept trying to battle through it, still thinking, this doesn’t make any sense, this is so weird. And then I became more and more anxious and more and more no and I had more and more this feeling that was a mix of sadness and fear. And so finally I felt I simply couldn’t do anything and I found myself at last lying in bed one day thinking, I can’t get up. And I laid there and thinking I can’t put the toothpaste on my tooth brush, I can’t brush or look my teeth, it just seemed like such an overwhelming task. It seemed much more frightening and much more overwhelming but at this point it seems to me, for example, to come into an interview on national public radio. And I thought how am I -- how am I trying to get out of bed and I lay there in bed just shaking in fear and feeling completely unable to do anything and feeling no emotion of any kind except that fear and anxiety. And I thought I have to call someone, I have to get out of my apartment and I couldn’t reach for the telephone, I laid there staring at the telephone thinking you just pick it up and do dial, but I simply couldn’t do it. Unfortunately someone called me and I said something has gone terribly, terribly wrong with me. 

00:07:05
BILL O'HANLON  All right. That’s from his interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air. And I just couldn’t imagine more pointedly describing and again my experience was slightly different, but that captured it pretty well and pretty politically. This is what people go through. So I just wanted to have this as our background. So as we move into this, you know we take this stuff seriously, it’s not a light thing that we are talking about, this could devastate people’s lives, obviously that it can ruin their life, some people kill themselves out of this. So I am passionate about finding alternative ways either help one people around medications or if medications have it work for them to find other ways of doing it. Now most people again know their traditional ways, you back into the person’s history, you do cognitive work, I’m going to talk about six alternative ways of treating depression. So let’s just get to them. The first one is, you know when I was under graduate school, I was psychology major and I heard about this thing called state-dependent learning. That is if you study in a certain room with like orange walls or something, if you are in that same room or you see orange when you take your test, you’d be more likely remember it. Well, it’s the same thing with emotional states, if you get into a depressed state, everything looks depressing, the present looks depressing, the past looks depressing, the future looks depressing. That state tends to influence your thinking. So when I meet with somebody, the first thing I do is start to investigate depression, but I also find out about times of non-depressed experience to help them move in and out of it. So they don’t get so stuck in this depressed state. So that’s our first strategy is, walking out of depressor land and we’re going to talk about this and how to do it in a minute. But first just I’ll give you some research that might be helpful. They found that when people talk about negative things, they are stress rises, their cortisol levels, which is a measurement of stress rises. So just dwelling on negative things makes people more depressed and more stressed, which adds into depression. So obviously, we as clinicians, people who work with people, we have to talk about depression, that’s what brings people there. But we can move back and forth between talking about the negative and talking about other things besides the depression as a way to help move that person out of that state dependent experience, because when they are in that, they can barely remember any of their resources, their strengths, any good things about their lives, any reason some times why they should try. So moving back and forth between these acknowledges the person’s depressed experience as well as that they have other parts to their life. It can also which is what we’re going to focus on in a few minutes, illuminate that they resources and skills and strengths and abilities and non-depressed experience. So that’s what we’re doing in this particular approach. We’re making maps of non-depressed times and comparing and contrasting those with depressed times. And so in the assessment, I move back and forth and what I noticed is, by the end of this time, people are already starting to feel a little better, they are feeling a little more hope, they are feeling, they are recognizing their strengths, they are not so caught up in this terrible experience that Andrew Solomon expressed to us. So again because we’re going to move on from this pretty quickly, I’ll just give you the results of, I was referred a person to see who had recurrent depressions, she will go into them, she lose her job, just stop going to her job, quit her job and she stay in these really depressed states like the one that Andrew Solomon was talking about for a couple of months. And she was in therapy at the time, but it just doesn’t seem to help and the medication didn’t seem to help. So as I was asked to consult with her, I learned from her as going back and forth between, so tell me about what your experience in depression. And I started crawl it, because we had started to lighten it a little, depressor land. When you are living and depressor land, what’s that like. When you are living in what she called confident or competent land and self-confident land, what’s different? And so she just gave me, it’s like we were making cartographers and we were making a map of the island of depression and the island of non-depression if you will. So she taught me, hey, when I’m depressed, I have a hard time getting out of bed, I don’t get out of bed until noon and maybe I’ll then sit in my living room, I’ll stay in my night clothes, I’ll eat breakfast cereal all day, I’ll avoid my friends. The only people I talk to is my therapist and my friend Steve who is also depressed. And so he and I talk about depression and so. That’s what she did mostly. If she thought about things, she thought about what a loser she was and how much worth she was getting and, um, she might have to go, not live independently anymore, but go live with her father and her step mother and if it got really bad, they would have to put in the hospital. So she think about the future in a very negative sort of way. And I said, okay, we’ll so compare and contrast that to your – at work and you’re doing better and you’re not depressed, you’re feeling more confident. Well, I get up before 9’o clock and I get out of the house. I get dressed, I take shower, I get out of the house, I maybe meet a friend for breakfast. If I’m having stress at work and I’m feeling like I’m slipping into depression, I’ll call a friend and go out to lunch with the friend and sometimes that really helps, I have somebody, some social support. And then, you know, I’ll – obviously I have a job, so I get out of house, I go to work. I spend time with my women friends rather than my friend Steve who is depressed. The other times I feel is too much of a burden on women friends, I can’t explain what’s going on. So as we’re talking about this, she starts to say, you know, what? I get a sense that if I got out of the house before 9’o clock every day, I could walk myself out of this depression. I said, okay, why don’t we try it? Why don’t you deliberately even though you’re in the middle of the depression right now, it usually takes you two months to get out, make – schedule an appointment with your girl friends to meet them every morning for the next five days. And she called me and said, it worked, I’ve walked myself out of depression, because I wanted to go live in that confident, competent place and I just needed a couple of little pieces of that place to walk myself out. Now again, you may think, you know, wow, she may not have been that depressed. When I asked her, she said, I was in the middle of the worst depression I’ve ever been. So if you believe in this mind body stuff, now maybe you don’t, but the actions can affect the mind and emotions, the thinking can affect the mind and emotions, interactions can affect the mind and emotion. So medications are one way to go in, but there are other ways to go in to change the brain, to change your biochemistry, to change your feelings, to change your thinking and one of these things is to discover what works for people. So obviously, one of the other ways to do this is to discover exceptions, sorry, I’m going to take quick drink here, to the usually pattern of depression like when would you have though, you would have gotten really depressed and didn’t discover resources that they are not drawing upon and again. When they are in this depressed mode, they perhaps won’t be able to remember many of their resources, they won’t think of themselves as a very resourceful person, they’ll think of themselves as a loser, hopeless. They get into that depressor mindset and that’s why I’d like to move back and forth during the assessment part, tell me about the problem, tell me about non-problem times. You know, years ago I read this book on Zen and Art. And the guy wrote this book said, in the Zen of art, when we try and draw a tree, we don’t draw the branches and leaves, we draw the spaces between and around the leaves and the branches and then the tree shows up. Well, that’s what happens for me when someone comes in and they say, I’m depressed. I think, when you are not depressed, because if you were never not depressed, you wouldn’t notice when you ever depressed. So I’m getting really curious, I’m really interested in moments when they have solved depression or something difficult before, moments when they are not having depression and moments of resources of strengths and abilities. And I marble those in with my assessment of, okay, tell me about your depression and how long you’ve had it and how you’ve been living there and what’s it like when you live there internally, externally, what’s your behavior, what are your thoughts, what are your interactions with other people, what environment are you in. I’m going to find anything that’s regularity of depression and anything that’s regularity that’s associated with not being depressed. And then of course, we move back and forth and hopefully we move them out of it. The other thing is that when people are depressed, they tend to be all or nothing. And I like to use this approach that I call inclusion, which has the big and. So I’ll give permission to feel as hopeless as they feel and also permission to feel some hope. So I might say, it’s okay to feel depressed, you don’t have to feel hope right now. And sometimes they are feeling so bad about themselves, it just giving them permission to be where they are is really helpful and then I do this thing called inclusion of opposes where I’d say, like, they want to kill themselves and they want to live. They feel hopeless and they say, can I make an appointment. They say, nothing is going to change, can I have an appointment next week. And so I’ll feed back to them and say, you’re hopeless and you’re hoping against hope things will get better. So just including the positive with the negative and we’re going to talk about that a little more in another one of these segments we’re going to talking about. And to point out exceptions, you feel hopeless except when you don’t feel hopeless to have them realize that there was more complexity to this then only feeling one way. And again, we’re going to talk about this in a slightly different way next and then in another one of the strategies in a couple of minutes. All right. Moving on, number two, I have a friend named Richard O'Connor, who wrote a book called Undoing Depression. And I really was upset when he wrote that book, because I love that because I used to talk to people about how to do a good depression. And I said, I used to – I used to be really depressed and I’ve been a therapist for all these years and I’ve seen people do depressions. So I’ll tell you how I do good depression if I ever going to do one. I would isolate myself, I would not move my body, don’t go out and exercise or anything that will put your depression in great danger, I would compare myself to other people and lose by the comparison. I would think about the past and remember all the things that I regretted or bad things that happened to me. I would think about the future and think how much worse things could be. And by that -- and when I’m talking to people and then I turn to him and I say, how do you do your depression, that’s how I would do a good one. And they – you know, they will smile and say, well, I do it this way and they all start to tell me. So one of the things is that depression isn’t a thing I think and we think of it as a thing like a diagnosis or a state, but really it’s more of a process. So what I want to find out is any regularities, it’s almost like the last one, but this time we’re really focusing on changing the patterns of depression. And so what I mean by that is find what they continually – there are three areas, how they do depression, how they view things while they are depressed and what context there in. So I call these patterns of the doing, the viewing and the context. And I’m really going to research for any regularities like how they act, how they hold their bodies, um, how do they speak, that’s all good doing. And then – and how they interact with other people, that’s part of the doing. And then the viewing is what are they focusing on, what are they focusing their attention on and what kind of meanings that they are making. So in this way, it’s a little like cognitive therapy, you’re going to challenge some of those meanings or change some of those meanings. And then what context was in, do they usually stay in their bedroom, do they stay at home, do they go out at all. Who do they hang around, do they feel disconnected from other people or overly dependent on other people. What are the contexts in which these experience of the depressions occur. And then we’re going to start to get in there and mess around with them. So we’re going to find any place that they have a moment of choice around their, the context, the actions, the views that they have of depression. And then start to mess around with those patterns, start to change those patterns. I’ll tell you an example, I studied with late Milton Erickson, who is a psychiatrist and one time, he told me this story and I was – I’m new therapist, this did not make any sense to me in this story. He was treating a guy and he was a psychiatrist who had access to medications, but he was treating a guy who was severely depressed and he just couldn’t get any change with the guy. And finally he tell the guy, I want you to go, you’re just sitting at home being depressed every day, I want you to go to the public library, now this is in the ‘60s. You know, I want you to go to the public library and I want you to be depressed there. Guy is like, okay, fine, so then psychiatrist says to do it, I’ll do it. So he goes to the public library and he is sitting there for a while and he gets a little bored sitting at the public library, so he gets up and he is always wanted to explore caves, he has never done it. He just, you know, a guy who thinks about things a lot and does do them. So he asked librarian where is the section of the library on spelunking and cave exploring and he she points him to it and he goes over there and he starts getting out magazines and books about it and starts looking at them. One day he shows up to the stacks and another guy is there looking at the same books. And the guy turns to him after a couple of minutes and says, hey, have you ever actually explored a cave or you just reading about it. He said, no, I’m never actually done, I’m just reading about it. He said, well, you want to try, I’m never done it either and I’m a little uncertain, and it help me if somebody would go with me. Would you like to go with me, would you like to go this week-end and go explore caves. They go out and started exploring caves, he makes a friend, he starts doing things, not just sitting around at home and he gets less depressed and he starts to come out of the depression. So Erickson tells me this story and I’m thinking, how did Erickson know that going to the library, he would meet this guy and come out of his – just, Erickson is weird extrinsic genius. And then years later after I – you know, as a therapist for many years and I understood more about Erickson’s work. I thought, he didn’t actually know that this guy would come out of his depression if he send him to the library. And then probably 99 people he send to the library but nothing happened, but this guy really made a difference and I thought, well, here is what Erickson thought. Erickson thought, if he keeps doing the same thing, thinking the same thing in the same context, nothing is going to change, nobody is going to walk to his – walk up to this house and say, hey, you want to go and explore cave with me, it’s just not going to happen. So if he puts him in a different context, something new can happen and that’s the essence of this particular, ah, this particular strategy. So what we’re going to do is search with people and find what are the regularities of their experience and actions and points of view and context of depression. So where do they usually get depressed? It’s usually in their bedroom, in their home, it’s – what activities they typically engage in when they are depressed. What – how long does it last? So timing, you know, sometimes Erickson would tell people I want you to be severely depressed for five minutes at 8’o clock every night, he would sort of schedule it. And that’s a really weird thing to do, but he was messing about with those patterns. Some people think he was a paradoxical therapist, but he is not necessarily paradoxical. He wanted to change the patterns. So the sequence is what happens, then what happens next, what happens next, just mess around with those and the people that are around, either people are isolated or they are only as we’ve heard in the previous strategy Elaine, who was the women I was working with depressed. She would only talk to a therapist and her friend Steve who is also depressed when she was depressed. But she would hang out with her women friends if she wasn’t depressed. So of course, whatever we want to do is change those patterns and get her to stop just talking to Steve and her therapist and start getting her to talk to other people and probably her women friends. So in this particular approach to changing depression, we’re going to discover, investigate almost like an anthropologist, what are the patterns of depression and then what moments of choice does that person have, do we have right in the office with him or in the treatment center or in the hospital. And when they go home or out of the hospital or out of the treatment center or out of our office what can we send them out with as an experiment to mess around the patterns to start to give them some traction out of the depression. All right. So that’s the second one. Again, we’re moving really quickly here, because I’ve to cover six and I want to make sure we get to them all. So the third one is shifting your relationship with depression. And again, we had more time and talk about the narrative approach which externalizes depression. But here, I want to stick with some of the stuff that we have some research on. That’s pretty interesting, the approach has come to the foreground recently and a lot of therapists are interested, comes from Buddhism from long time ago, mindfulness. And mindfulness really what we mean is just noticing one’s depression rather than getting swept up at it, noticing without judging, not getting swept up in it, more witnessing rather than getting caught up. So getting a little distance from the depression, what happens for most people when they get depressed is, they get suck down of that vortex and again we heard of really good description with Andrew Solomon earlier of just being pulled down below the basement, really so deeply into serious depression, it’s hard to get out. But we all have that capacity for a little witnessing and a little difference, but that’s a trained capacity. You know, people in the east spend years meditating and learning to watch their mind, watch their bodies, watch their emotions, listen to their minds, listen to their bodies, listen to their emotions. And it turns out that this – this has been a well-researched approach, Teasdale, Zindel Segal who was up in Canada has done some research on this. And they have written some articles and books about this. And they’ve got some pretty good results. So they called this Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy or MBCT. And they found in one of their research studies that this MBCT so called approved as effective as maintenance anti-depressants and preventing relapse and more effecting – effective in enhancing people’s quality of the life. So that’s working as well as medications. And again, if you think of the mind body connection, we know that the brain is plastic and it’s can change, neurology can change. And if you change your brain in the direction of learning to pay attention to how the depression sort of shows up for you, then you can get some distance from it and perhaps not get so caught up at it. So what they found is, I’ve given you a slide here, but over 15 months after the trial, 47% of the group following their MBCT course experienced a relapse compared with 60% of those continuing the normal treatment including anti-depressant drugs. In addition the group on the MBCT program reported a higher quality of life in terms of their overall enjoyment of daily living and physical well-being. So just getting, shifting your relationship in depression, so you don’t get sucked into the vortex of diving down into this terrible experience, but instead you can witness yourself in your body, in your mind, in your emotions, in your relationships. Again, one of the other things with mindfulness is related to what we talked about in the first strategy that is to notice variations. When people talk about depression, I think, they just say, I’m depressed or I’m really depressed. But it turns out you know when they train people in this mindfulness based approach. They discover that there are variations, some days they feel a little better, some days the quality of the depression shifts. But because we tend to generalize, we think, I’m depressed that’s it. When you train people to make these fine distinctions to really notice what’s going on in terms of their depressive experience, they sometimes get noticed that they feel a little better sometimes and they notice that there are relieving moments, there are deeper moments. They then notice often what’s correlated with things getting worse and things getting better and again that might lead them to have some way out. The other thing is that bunch of studies in mindfulness have shown that it increases some of the frontal lobe, so called executive control things and depression tends to work on the more emotional brain. And so if you can strengthen this part of the brain with mindfulness practice, it is really a practice like meditation is a practice. Then I think it can make a real difference. So I’ve given you some other reference here to mindfulness based cognitive therapy research if you are interested in going further in this. So let’s go on to number four here, fourth strategy. And that is challenging isolation, what happens for people when they are depressed. I think when people experiencing any kind of stress or emotional or psychological disturbance, they tend to both feel ashamed of it and they tend to withdraw from other people. You know, what you hear from people who are depressed a lot is, I don’t want to be a burden to other people or you know, I try and explain what happens with depression with my depression to other people and they just don’t get. They tell me to cheer up or why am I so unhappy, I have this great life and I have this and I have that. And so people sometimes don’t, well I don’t know what to say, they either because they are feeling misunderstood or like it’ll be burden on people, they withdraw from people. So that’s one of the things that isolates people when they experience depression. And another thing that happens is they push people away, you know, I’ve been in relationship with someone who suffered severe depression. And basically what, their behavior if they don’t just say, go away, which sometimes they do, their behavior pushes other people away. They are not very fun to be around, they are not cheerful, they are don’t respond, sometimes they respond monosyllabically or they don’t have much expression in their voice. You know, you make a joke, they don’t laugh, you try and connect with them, they don’t connect very well, they sit restlessly. So one of the typical things that happens with depression and with again a lot of other psychological and emotional disturbances is that people become isolated. And you know, here is the thing, we’re social beings, we evolved in social groups and tribes if you will. And if we’re isolated, there is no research on this, the more you are isolated the more cortisol again, the more stress you have, the more disconnected you get, the more difficult your experience tends to be. So in this strategy, you know, that just puts in mind of a research study I came across some time ago and it was a study of this earthquake that happened in Romania, it was like one of these major earthquakes like we had in Haiti just last year. They discovered that people who are alone during the earthquake, this Romanian earthquake developed post-traumatic stress disorder at much higher rates than people who are with other people during the earthquake. So there seems to be something about connecting to other people that is it modulates stress, ]it modulates distress, it modulates discomfort. So what we’re doing in this is in this strategy this number fourth, the fourth strategy for non-medication ways to beat the blues and to challenge depression, we’re assessing where people are in terms of their connectivity with other people and helping restore some of these connections. Now here is the problem, at least, I’m doing this webcast and doing this recording from the United States and I think this is true in most industrialized countries and that is social isolation has increased over the years. There was a book maybe some of you saw as Robert Putnam book and it was called Bowling Alone. And in this book, he calls this stuff social capital and he says, social capital in the United States has been diminishing over the last 50 years. There was a certain inflexion point in late ‘50s, early ‘60s and all of a sudden, people stopped doing things socially so much. And having had kids and some of you have kids with all the electronic stuff you have everybody seeing at the dinner table texting or looking at their ipads or watching television or you’re not even sitting at the dinner table, you’re having dinner somewhere else and one of the kids is in one of the bedrooms, I think there was an invitation in modern life to be more independent, more isolated and you really have to make an effort to connect to people. So let me share with you some of the stuffs that I learned from Robert Putnam and some of the other researchers in recent developments in social isolation. Shared family dinners and family vacations are down a third in the last -- over a third in the last 25 years. Having friends over to the house is down by 45% over the last 25 years. That used to be a very common thing and now it’s less common, people tend to come home and they cocoon. Participation in clubs, in civic organization is down by over 50% in the last 25 years. It’s not just that now we have working couple where the women and the man are going out to work, that's certainly an element of it. People are just working more, they are working longer hours, they are coming home, getting on their computers and checking their email and doing more work. So work has an influence on this. Church attendance has down by about a third since 1960s. The average American has only two close friends. And again, other parts of the world maybe a little different in this. But I think as they get more industrialized, as they get more Americanized with the fast food that comes and the other cultural exports that we have, I think you'll find that more and more people are isolated. Now it’s interesting, this maybe a correlation and maybe a cause, we don’t really know, but the more people are isolated, the higher the rates of depression. We have -- and interestingly that when you move to a new country, you tend to get depression at the same rates that country has it like if we get a bunch of immigrants to America, those immigrant groups tend to have higher rates than if they came from a country with lower rates of depression. So there is something culturally something about this. And again, American culture, and I think a lot of cultures over – all over the globe now are very individualized, we can be, because there is more affluent, you don’t have to depend on so many people for your living or for your support. We can – we also have more technology that tends to be isolating technology. Obviously, the web can be connective or it can dis-connective, but on whole there have a lot written about this and I don’t need to philosophize about it, but it tends to be isolating. That maybe contributing depression, if it’s not contributing to depression, it may be making it harder for people to recover from depression. One in four Americans report that they have no one to confide it. Again, we as clinicians, we as therapists, counselors, maybe the only people they connect with. And that may not be enough to really help them feel that social support and social connection. In 1990, more than one in five households were headed by a single parent, it’s now about one in three. So it’s changing in that more isolated direction again, but given the recent economic changes in the United States, in Europe and all over the world maybe there will be trend and I think there has been a trend to people moving back in other people sharing houses with other people. So in some ways even though this is economically stressful, it may be actually good for depression rates and recovery from depression. All right. 6.27 million people in the US lived alone in 1990 and that’s expected to increase to 29 million people by 2015. Again, the economic situation may change that trend, but when people are depressed as I said before, they often pull away from other or put them off, they push them away in certain ways. So depression invites this isolation. It turns out that the University of Chicago, they do a general social survey every year. And what they discovered is that people with five or more close friends, excluding family members, you know, family members are certain kind of connection, excluding family members, describe themselves as very happy or more likely describe themselves very happy than people with fewer friends. So social connectivity is connected, positive psychology researches have shown this. Sonja Lyubormirsky, one of the positive psychology researchers on California said, the single most prevalent finding in positive psychology research is that rich and good social connections are correlated with happiness. So the opposite is true that fewer social connections are correlated, they don’t necessarily cause, but they are correlated with unhappiness. And in most people if you do general surveys of cultures, many people would describe themselves as at least happy and some people describe themselves as very happy. The people who don’t are about 10% of the population. Well, it turns out, 10% of the population is what the depression rates are as well. So people who describe themselves as very unhappy typically don’t have many rich social connections. So how do we, you now, what you’re going to do about this, if you are a clinician. Well, if you know this research then I think one of the things that you can do is make sure you assess people’s level of social connectiveness. And that you encourage them to either maintain or keep their current social connections or to increase their social connections. So that, you know, again Judith Beck cognitive therapist did a research study that show that people who are treated individually for post-traumatic stress or in group treatments, people in group treatments recovered at much quicker and at higher rates. And so you would think the same thing is that people who are depressed tend to isolate and if there is a possibility even through the web, but obviously through group therapy through support groups, maybe depressions for groups that if you can get them connect with other people, this is going to be a really important support for their recovery. So isolation increase cortisol stress, connection with people, again has to be positive social connection, stressful social connections aren’t so great, um, can help people recover, feel better, have less stress. And we’re going to talk about this stress and brain connection in a couple of minutes. All right. So let’s talk about, um, the next strategy, which is the fifth strategy, a future with possibilities. We’re going to spend a little time on this, because it’s so counterintuitive, most of the time people who have been depressed don’t think very positively about the future or sometimes the future just collapses on them, they don’t even think they have a future. So in this approach, which is, again, usually psychotherapy, when you – if somebody comes in for psychotherapy, what are we going to do? We’re going to go back to the past and find where something happened earlier on that may have led to depression, if you’re more neurological biochemical psychiatrist you’re going to think, well, you know, they have a genetic propensity or biochemical propensity or something happened in the room or something happened in the childhood, if you are more psychodynamic or relational therapist, I think whether there was an attachment problem when they were younger or there were traumas when they were younger that added into made them more vulnerable for depression. I’m suggesting that one of the solutions for – in therapy or helping people who are depressed is to instead, not really focus on the past, instead focus on the future with possibilities. So let me tell you two things. And these are – I’m going to tell a long story, so bear with me because I think they make a point. Um, these are related stories, because I’m going to tell you something about something I’ve discovered when I was depressed and started to come out of my depression about the future that really affected me. But let me start with a story that I heard many years after I came out of depression, but it just really moved me because it was very similar to how I got out of depression. So, um, I call this Viktor Frankl strategy, because Viktor Frankl some of you know, he wrote Man's Search for Meaning and a bunch of other books. He was a Viennese psychiatrist lived in Europe for many, many years and then came to America, had a bestselling book that’s Man's Search for Meaning. And I read him when I was a teenager actually and – but I’ve never met him. In 1990, I got the opportunity, I was at a big psychotherapy conference, one of these evolution of psychotherapy conference, 7,000 people there. And Frankl was invited to give the key note address, one of the key note addresses. And he talked about his work and his life and the development of his work and his life and he was influenced Freud and then Adler. And he told this story during his, the talk that he gave that was – it just grabbed me, the story. It illustrates this technique, this method that we’re talking about, so well that I want to share with you. So Frankl, again, Viennese psychiatrist, he was Jewish and that’s relevant for this story, because he was arrested by the Nazis in World War II and put in a concentration camp. He was put in with his wife and his mother and father and he was first put in one concentration camp and then separated from his wife and mother. His father died in that first concentration camp and he was with him. So he knew he lost his father, but then he was separated from his wife and his mother. So he had a reason to survive because he wanted to reunite with his wife and with his mother and see if he could be of any help to them, if he could get back to them. But they were put in different concentration camps, and Frankl was ultimately moved between four different concentration camps and he ended his captivity in the last one which is in a place that's now Poland. And he had a personal reason to keep going but he also had a professional reason to keep going. What do I mean by that? I mentioned he was influenced by Freud then he got into Adler's -- Alfred Adler's inner circle. And while he was in there and he was one of Adler's prodigies, he developed a new idea. And the new idea was that -- Adler's thing was search for power and self-esteem and things like that and Frankl thought that -- what Freud said about the deep unconscious trauma, all that stuff is relevant, but what Frankl decided was that the central to mental health is man's search for meaning. That is the meaning was so important, the spirituality meaning was so important that this was central to mental health and nobody else in the mental health psychiatry area were talking about meaning and spirituality and Adler didn't like this idea. And he argued with Frankl about it and finally he kicked Frankl out of his inner circle and said you are not my disciple anymore, you are saying harass basically. And so Frankl decided to go his own way. So he began to write a book on this idea of spirituality and meaning being central to mental health. And then he was arrested by the Nazis. Well, he knew that the Nazis wouldn't like this idea. So he sewed the manuscript into the lining of his coat. When he got to the first concentration camp, the Nazis took his coat and burned it. Okay, so the only place this book exists now is in his mind, Frankl's mind. So he has another reason to survive. He has got survive this experience if at all possible because he is the only one who has this idea and he is afraid if he dies no one will ever come up with his idea and bring it to psychiatry and mental health. So he has got a professional reason to keep going as well. And how he kept himself alive through some of these terrible experiences and depravations in the concentration camp is he imagined himself giving lectures and he writes the book in his mind's eye. This is how he fills the terrible hours that he is in the concentration camp. So that's all background for what he told me or he told the whole audience in 1990 in California -- Anaheim, California. He one day it's near the end of the war and the prisoners know it's near the end of the war even though they don't have radio and newspaper any news coming to them because they can see the ally bombers coming over closer and closer and more and more each day and the German guards started to treat them a little nicer and the German guards looked like they are freaking out. And the food is running out, the supplies are running out. So the prisoners think, maybe we are going to survive this. There is a possibility and Frankl was very hopeful, maybe we are going to survive this, but one day there was an ally bomber that comes over, it bombs a bridge right just a mile or two from the concentration camps. So the guards are ordered to march the prisoners out there, fix the bridge because it's part of the German supply line. And so Frankl finds himself in the middle of a snowy field in really bad winter, the last winter of the war of 1944 was a really cold winter, and he is being marched with a bunch of other prisoners. He has thin clothing on, inadequate for that Polish winter, holes in his shoes, no socks and he is ill in some way. He is just not healthy and he has got some sort of bronchitis or pneumonia or something like this, being marched through this snowy filed on a freezing day and he just barely making it, he hasn't had much food, he has been abused and deprived and things like that. So he is walking through this field being marched with a bunch of other prisoners, out to do this work detail. And all of a sudden, he can't do it anymore. He gets really, really sick. He is starting to feel really sick and really weak and he starts coughing. And one cough brings on another cough, brings on another cough, brings on another cough, and pretty soon he collapses to one knee and he just goes down into the snow and he can't go on anymore. And the guard comes over, really upset and he has got his baton, he starts hitting him, saying, get up, get up, you are slowing down the whole filed, we are all freezing here, just keep marching. Frankl can't, he is too weak and he is coughing and coughing and he can barely pay attention to the guy. And the guy becomes enraged, the guard, and he starts to beat him and just beats him on the head and the back and now he collapses to all fours in the snow and he thinks I had this idea that maybe I was being kept alive for a reason, maybe the god or the universe was keeping me alive for a reason but now I realize that was just illusional, it's just true. I am just going to die here today because I am so weak, I just can't get up. Now without his conscious intention and willpower all of a sudden Frankl found himself in his mind's eye imagining that he was in post war Vienna giving a lecture on the psychology of death camps and the psychology of meaning. And he is giving this imaginary lecture to about 200 people meanwhile he is in the snow in a field outside the concentration camp. And he imagines giving this lecture every word is pointed, every word is just right. And he is giving this lecture to -- on death psychology, death camp psychology meaning during this lecture he talks about the day Viktor Frankl almost died back in the war and how he was in the snowy filed that he was on all fours and he had no strength and he couldn't get up and then miracle of miracles he found the strength to get up. While he is giving this imaginary lecture that part of the imaginary lecture his body gets up in the field in Poland. And then he said -- and then I took one step in the frozen sow and another step in the frozen snow and head hurt, my back hurt, my chest hurt, my feet hurt, but I took another step. He imagines this lecture all the way out to the work detail, just broadly does what he needs to do to fix the bridge, imagines it all the way back. Time just sort of slows down and stretches out. And as he is collapsing into his bone because he gets back to the concentration camp, he imagines getting a standing ovation from 200 people of the wonderful speech that he gave that was so moving, pointed, filled with great insights and he survives another day. Well, I saw him in 1990 in Anaheim, California getting standing ovation from 7,000 people. So what did Frankl do different from what most of us do when we are in crisis, he instead of going frozen in that moment in time he projected himself into future where things worked out. When I heard that story, it just galvanized me. I was electrified because that's the exact thing that happened to me. What happened for me was when I was really depressed I had a friend that I went to see and I told I was planning to kill myself and she said, what do you mean, kill yourself. Now, I had thought about this long time and I just couldn't do it. I was raised in a big Irish catholic family around Chicago and it's kind of a protected environment but my family had this value that when you are 18, you are supposed to go away and become independent, cut the apron strings, the umbilical cord and I was the least prepared. I was really the shy one, I was really anxious and I went a long way. I mean, they really encouraged you to go and be independent. So here I am 18 and I go all the way to Arizona, I go to this massive university and it's during the late '60s early '70s, it's hippy time, I get all swept up in that. I start to question everything, all my values, reality, I started to experiment with some of those substances that make you question reality and I just was so shy. I would go to a beginning one-on-one class and there would be 500 people in that. I was so shy I barely made any friends. I made a couple of friends, they were about as alienated and shy and weird as I was and unhappy as I was. So I just started to sink into this really deep depression like the kind that you heard described earlier and I just became more and more isolated. Pretty soon I was sleeping, I couldn't go to class. I was sleeping for 20 hours a day. I was really, really miserable. And finally I just decided I am just not meant for this world. I am too sensitive. I feel like when I am around people I have no skin on, just all exposed, nerves and I actually can't this life. I am not just meant for it. I would sit around and write poetry, but I couldn't show anybody my poetry because I was too afraid of rejection. So it wasn't going to be much of a living. And I thought, well, I don't -- I can't work because I can barely function. All I wanted to do is write poetry and I can't make a living in that. So it's painful enough now but in a couple of years I am going to be out of university. What am I going to do then, it's going to be even worse. I am just not going to be able to make a living. I am miserable, I can't be around people, I don't like myself. So I just decided I was going to check out. Well, I went to say goodbye to the first couple of friends and they were like, yeah, me too, that's the way I feel, but I am afraid to die so I admire your courage was basically their response. They were just like, hey, whatever, I will see you next life and I am sure it will all be better for all of us because this life sucks. Then when I got to my third friend who was more normal and I told her my plan and she was like why would you do that, no you can't kill yourself and the other ones were like so accepting. I was really taken aback and I said, you know, I will expose nerves, can't be around people, I am in university now, what I am going to do later, all I want to do is write poetry, I can't be around people because I just don't get along with people. I don't even get along with myself and I don't want to work for a corporation. I just can't do that. I can barely get out of bed and she said, look, don't do this. I said, no, I am pretty much decided. I got to do this. She said, how about this, she said, I have three aunts. They live in Nebraska, they are never married, I am their favorite niece, and they have told me when they die I am going to inherit everything. And they have not only saved their money, they are frugal, but they have invested in farming and a lot of farmers at that time were selling their farms because farming wasn't a great thing to be in and they have invested in farm and they would buy the farm and then lend it out to the farmer next door to farm so that that farmer was still in business. So, said, when one of these aunts die, when all of these aunts dies they are going to -- I am going to inherit everything and I am going to inherit these farms and they always have an empty farmhouse there. So if you promise me you won't kill yourself, I will promise you can go live in one of these farmhouses the rest of your life. You won't need to be around people, you can write your poetry, you won't need any money because you could grow your own food which in my delusional state at 19, reading Mother Earth News, I was sure I could do. I tried it a few years later. It's really hard to grow your own food. But she said really you could do this. You don’t need to kill yourself. There is a plan and you could be outside of the world, you wouldn't have to be around people. Please don't kill yourself. So I thought, now that's a possibility. I might be able to do that life if I wouldn’t have to be around people, I wouldn't have to work, I could live on my own, write poetry, maybe I could that life, but I didn’t jump right away. I said how old are your aunts. She said well they are in their 60s and I thought well they are almost dead. I was 19. They looked like they were ancient to me now that I am that age, it seems relatively young to me, but at that time it seemed really, really like odds are in the next three years while I finish university there is three of them, well I am just going to kick off, it turns out they never did. They lived till they were in their 90s. But I was thinking they wouldn't be. But here is what happened for me, instantly, instantly I wasn't suicidal, why because I had a future to live into. When I heard that Viktor Frankl story later, I thought that's my story. My story was the past sucked, the present sucked and my view of the future sucked. That is it all looked bad probably because I was depressed, right. And that colors your perceptions about things. But as soon as I had a possible future that was a little more positive and they didn't involve so much pain and suffering that I could escape from some of the pain and suffering life was worth living. There was something in my future to go towards. So that's why I call that the farmhouse in my future. And I think with other people who are depressed they have often lost connection with the possible future, with the positive future, or the future that has anything that relieves their suffering. So one of the things we can do to make our therapy more effective is to go to the future rather than stay in the present or the past. That doesn’t seem very promising to most people who are depressed. Now how do you do this if they are not Viktor Frankl and they don't have a friend who promises a farmhouse in the future, don't worry. I have worked out some methods for doing this. So the firs method I have is to do what I call Carl Rogers with a Twist. And what I mean by that, I mean Carl Rogers was the counselor, a counseling psychologist who said when people tell you their problems or their feelings reflect those and validate them. So I worked out a procedure that involves reflecting while inviting people into the future. So I call this problems into preferences. So if a person says I don't have enough energy to get out of bed, it takes me hours to get out of bed, that's their past complaint about something they don’t like, something they are suffering from or would like to change. And my response, I call that Carl Rogers, but why I call it Carl Rogers with a Twist is I'll reflect that but I will put it into the future and what they would want instead of the past and what they don’t want. So I might say if they say I can't get out of bed, I have no energy to get out of bed or it takes me hours to get out of bed, I will say, so you would like to have a little more energy and get out of bed a little more quickly. And if they nod, that is they give you the sense that they felt heard with that reflection, with that validation, you have done two things, one is obviously you have made a nice connection with them and you validated them, but the other thing and why I call that Carl Rogers with a Twist is you shifted their attention into a future with hope and possibilities. So if they say, I don't have any reason, I can't think of a reason to live, my response might be, so you would like to find a reason to stay here and not kill yourself. You go from the past and what they don't want to the future and what they would want. And as you may have heard in the first example, I tried and do it in small increments instead of you will jump out of bed cheerful, I will say you like to have a little more energy to get up a little more quickly. So what I am doing is validating that person but inviting them into the future with possibilities and I do this throughout the assessment. Maybe 20 or 30 times I will find myself shifting them from what they say they don't want in the past to what they would want in the future and sometimes I get it wrong but they will correct me, that's all right and so that's the simplest way to, I guess, plant seeds of possibility for the future. The second way I learned from Milton Erickson and Erickson, they are the psychiatrists that I mentioned before, he was one of my teachers, he used to do this thing. When I went out to study with him I just want to learn psychotherapy, but he did hypnotherapy. I didn't really know that much about hypnotherapy and it scared me, frightened me a little. I thought it was pretty wearied. But I became fascinated with it because he did it really well and he could create these massive changes sometimes to people. But he did a different kind of hypnotherapy. He didn't do this, you will go deeply into trance kind of think. He wasn't into that. He was much more indirect and I one time heard him hypnotize a person without telling that person to go into trance and that person went into trance and I was fascinated by it. When we talked about it, what he did was he said to her, just listen to this because it's related to this method for -- this future method for dealing with depression, even though it was a hypnosis example. He said, I really don't know what you are going to experience after you go into trance. You don't have to go into trance right away. You can take your time about going into trance because you know how easy it is for you to go into trance. And when you are in trance, I want to talk with your unconscious mind about some things that are really going to be of value to you. And he said, you don’t have to close your eyes that quickly and she closed her eyes and went into trance. I was stunned watching this and I was thinking, gosh, he never told her to go into trance. He just speculated about what things would be like while she was in trance, before she went into trance, after she came out of trance and from that I learned this second technique which I called positive expectancy lately. So I might say things to my clients or my patients like after you come out of this depression, as things improve, as you start to feel more energy, as you start to feel better, I start to let my language reflect the expectation that are going to come through out of and beyond depression. So after you come out of depression what lessons you think you will bring back from this terrible experience that you have had. Before you come out of depression I am going to want to understand a little more about what it has been like for you. So you hear that before you come out of depression. There is an expectancy that they are going to come through and out of the depression. So again I weave that kind of language into the assessment, into the conversation that I have with people with each session so that we start to see those positive expectancies for the future. Another simple technique is to have people write themselves a letter from the future and what I mean it's not any future, it's a future in which they have already gotten through and beyond the depression. We are going to have them write themselves a letter from a better future to the present and say, here is how you have got through it. Again, I got this one from Erickson. Erickson used to sometimes get stuck with people because he did hypnosis, he would put them into trance and he would say, okay, time is changing. It's now a year since your last appointment you came to see me. You resolved your problem and now we are back -- you are back for a year follow-up, tell me what I said to you during therapy and what changes you made during the therapy that helped you come through your problem. And they would tell while they were in trance and then he would say, okay, go deeply into trance, forget what you just told me. And he would bring them out of trance having an induced amnesia so they would forget it and then he would do the wonderful therapy that they told them he had done. And what I got from that and I am not that good and hypnotherapy, so I can't do that stuff and develop my amnesia, but what I got from that is people often have a blueprint for how changes are going to happen. And if you can evoke that blueprint from within them, they will often move closer to the solution to their problem. So I suggest that they write a letter from the future back to the present and tell themselves how they got through the depression. This is just a purely imaginable exercise, but how they got through this difficult depression, how they came out the other side, what they learned and maybe because your future self is always smarter and kinder than you are, some sage and compassion and advice for this person who is suffering in the present. And I found that sometimes people write really powerful letters and in those letters there is a blueprint for how to move through and out of depression. That is they know their own solution better than I know their solution. Now the fourth method that I have listed here on the slide is starting therapy from the post-depression perspective. Most therapy again is focused on the present or the past and I like to start my therapy with people who are depressing, okay, when we are done with therapy what will be happening in your life, how will you be feeling. So again that moves them out of the depressed mindset and feeling tone to a future with hope and possibility. And I find just by starting at the end when they are better that it relieves a little of the depression in the present and also gives them again some hope. It also gives me a direction where do they want to go, how would they imagine life would be like if they have less depression or they resolve their depression or things were better. So those are ways to invite people out of these depressed experiences into hope for the future, right. Now I have saved for me what the best one is for last. I call this restarting brain growth. Again like mindfulness, brain science has come into psychotherapy and counseling in a big way in the last five or ten years, well here is the thing. There is a new hypothesis that comes right from neurological studies and brain studies that is called the neurogenic and neuro atrophy hypothesis and how to use it to resolve depression. And this is to me some of the most exciting stuff that has come out of -- that's available for a therapist to help people change. So let's go into this. Here is the thing that really inspired me. I have a newsletter that I sent out to people every month with resources on it and sometimes I recommend books in the newsletters, books that I have just read that have really moved me and that are filled with hope and possibility, kind of inspirational books. And one day one of my newsletter readers wrote me, a women in New York who corresponded with me a lot, and she had recommended some other books and they were always great recommendations. So I really -- Rachael is her name, and I really was like every book that this person has recommended had been really good so she recommended this book. That was called The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge. Norman Doidge is a neurologist and psychiatrist from New York and Canada, had two practices. And I have got this book and I was blown away by this book. It was number one, wonderfully written, I recommend it to you, The Brain That Changes Itself, Norman Doidge. And number two like a science adventure story it was written almost like a novel, it was very well researched, but also compellingly written. I just couldn’t stop. It was a like a novel page turner, but it was an adventurous story of -- I was an undergraduate I mention I went to undergraduate in Arizona state psychology major and what I learned in neurological psychology was that brains were growing and changing when you were a child, maybe into adolescence or early adulthood at the most, but after that they stop growing and start to deteriorate, that was a pretty bad news. They were fixed the way they were. Well, what this book was about was the adventurous story of a new paradigm shift in neuro psychology, in neuro psychiatry where a bunch of researchers independently discovered that that wasn't true. That is brains could change and grow even new brain cells all through the life. So this is called neuroplasticity or brain plasticity or neurogenesis and neurogenesis is new brain cells can grow even all through the life, even in adulthood and that neuroplasticity means that brains can change their functioning and connectivity all through life as well. Now I say can, but they don't always. So that's what brings us to this hypothesis that we are talking about. So all brain science said brain had a fixed structure. Once you learn something and it's set, that was absorbed to the part of the brain that had to with hearing, part of it do with vision, part of it do with higher executive functioning kind of cognitive thinking, part of it do with emotions, and those structures never change. It turns out that's not true that the brain changes as a result of experience. One of the first studies that I read about this was an interesting thing, they did brain scans and then later autopsies of cabbies that were master cabbies in London. And what they discovered was these people didn't start learning their skill until they were adults. In order to be a master cabbie in London you have to memorize what they call the A to Z, all the streets and sometimes they are a half a block long in London and there is this convolute streets. You have to know them by memory. And what they discovered when they did brain scans of these master cabbies and compared them to regular cabbies is that the parts of their brains that had to with visual memory were much more developed bigger, more connectivity and more blood flow to their part of their brain when they did functional MRIs. And so these were adults who changed their brain as adults. They knew that with musicians, the auditory parts of the brain were more developed with musicians. They found this with song birds. They would autopsies of brain and if they taught them a new song as a song bird their brains would change, the structure of their brains would change even as an adult. And so what this new view said was brains can change at any time. Then I bought this book on Amazon and if you ever go on Amazon buy anything it says, people who bought this book liked this book. So they hooked me to buy the next book which was by a guy named John Ratey who you might have read another of his books called Driven to Distraction, it was about ADD, he co-wrote that book. He got interested in this idea because he was a runner and he stopped running and he felt his ADD increase. Then he had another guy who came into see him who had been a marathon runner and this guy injured his knee, blew out his knee or something, he couldn't run anymore and this guy got depressed. And he was -- Ratey was thinking, maybe there is a relationship between mood disorders and attention disorders and exercise and he went to research it. And he found there was a lot of evidence for it. And so when I read this book it really got me excited because Norman Doidge's book said the brains can change all through the life, John Ratey's book said, mood disorders can be influenced and helped by exercise and brain growth and I was thinking why doesn't every psychotherapists know this. I didn't know this. Nobody ever taught me this. So I started to investigate and get really excited about what they call the neurogenic and neuro atrophy hypothesis. Basically what they found was brains can grow new cells, they arise in the hippocampus, I guess, and may be other places, but we know for sure in the hippocampus in children and adults, but they don't always grow new brain cells. When do they stop growing new brain cells, adult brains, when they are under stress or they don't learn anything new or they don't get any nurturing, you have bad nutrition or you have brain damage or something like that. But extreme stress stops the growth of new brain cells, all right. So experiments have also found in autopsies again that when people have long-standing untreated depression that that part of the brain atrophies, the hippocampus, atrophies, there is damage to that part of the brain so that long-term untreated depression creates lesions in the brain, damage in the brain, right. All right, so antidepressants interestingly on the other hand lead to the birth of new brain cells even when you are under stress and in animal models when they give animals who don't have the placebo effect one would think, when they give animals antidepressants it takes two to three weeks before the brain cells start to be born. And so this is about how long it takes people to respond to antidepressants. So here is the thing. We used to think it was -- again if you watch TV and they give you the cartoon version of depression, they say it's all about serotonin, it used to be norepinephrine and dopamine and now they are saying, you know what, antidepressants may support the brain in creating new connections and growing new brain cells. So if an antidepressant is given while somebody is under extreme stress or an animal is under extreme stress, it helps prevent that decline in new brain cells being born. So this is called the neurogenic, neuro atrophy hypothesis. Now it's not proven, but neither is the serotonin hypothesis of depression or the genetic hypothesis of depression. It turns out there is a bunch of components that support brain growth and you don't need to know all the biochemistry, but IGF1 is an Insulin-like growth factor, VEGF which is a vascular endothelial growth factor which helps more blood vessels grow in the brain and the rest of the body and BDNF. And BDNF it turns out to be a really big one, one of the guys, John Ratey calls it Miracle-Gro for the brain. It's brain-derived neurotrophic factor. That is it helps -- if you have more of this, it helps brain cells grow and it also helps new connectivity, right. So when people have been depressed and they do autopsies afterwards, they find decreased hippocampal and cortical BDNF levels. They have less than an average person and several studies have shown increased BDNF when people have treated with antidepressants for some time. It helps maybe why antidepressants work for some people and they don't work for other people and certain antidepressants work is they are helping people grow new brain cells. Now again, not everybody responds to every antidepressants. Sometimes they have side effects, sometimes they are not willing to take them. So what can you do. The biggest thing that you can do besides taking antidepressants if you are depressed is exercise. Now I came across another book because Amazon said if you like that book and you like that book, other people bought this book and it was by a psychologist named Keith Johnsgard that was called Conquering Depression and Anxiety Through Exercise and here in this book I found a bunch of evidence which again I have never heard about as a psychotherapist that said if people are depressed get them moving. There is a bunch of evidence for this. Again, it's not determined yet, but here is one experiment. In people ages 60 to 80 those who are robotically exercised three plus hours a week over the course of ten years showed an increase of the number of large blood vessels in the cerebral region of the brain, it's just the same thing when they tell you to exercise for your heart, it helps the blood flow better and new blood vessels get created, an increase in blood flow to the three major cerebral arteries and the cerebral area controls consciousness, memory, initiation of activity. Remember a lot of people who are depressed can initiate activity very well, emotional response, language and word associations and if obviously the opposite, the narrowing and loss of blood vessels doesn't do well for your thinking and doesn't do well for your mood. It's associated with cognitive decline. Now here is the most amazing one for me. That's a correlational study, right, people exercising, they found more brain cells, but they developed more blood vessels. Here is one that they did as an interventional exercise. Duke is a place where they do a lot of nutritional research and Duke designed a study pretty interesting study to me, and it's called, SMILE, the Standard Medical Intervention and Long-term Exercise. They had a bunch of people, but of those people 156 of them were diagnosed with major depressive disorder, MDD or from the DSM. They were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. One had exercise only, exercise treatment and exercise consisted a brisk walking, jogging, or stationary bicycle riding three times a week, ten minute warm up, 30-minute exercise, five minute cool down. Then they had ZOLOFT treatment, the ZOLOFT for those of you who are not in the United States, is an antidepressant, a brand named antidepressant here, the typical SSRI and serotonin based one and combined treatment, right. They had them do exercise and take the medication. So those were the conditions. They assigned some people to exercise only, some people to have the medication only and some people to have both. Here is what the results were and it blew my mind. At the end of four months, 60 to 70% of the participants no matter whether they were on medications or medications and exercise or exercise were better. They were vastly improvers symptom free in all three conditions, but on the ten-month follow-up, here is what the mind blowing thing is, 38% of the medication people had a recurrence of their depression. 31% of the people who exercised and took the medication had a recurrence. So fewer but only 8% of the exercise only had a recurrence of depression and people who continued to exercise, not everybody did after the initial four months, they only had 8% had a recurrence. Now why was this, why didn't exercise and medication do better, there is a couple of hypothesis. One is that they may have interfered with one another in terms of growth of new brain cells. The other one is self-efficacy, people said I did it myself, I exercised, I didn't take any medication and of course some people continued to exercise. That made a difference. And it turns out how much exercise matters. For every 50 minutes of exercise per week was correlated with a 50% drop in depression levels. Now I don't know why this isn't broadcast from every news station in the country and obviously the drug companies aren't going to advertise this because this is non-drug intervention and anybody can do this. Now how to get them do it, we will talk about in a few minutes, but there is another psychiatrist who read about this and he had what's called treatment resistant depressed people. That is he use medications for depression and he found some people just didn't get the benefits from medication no matter how much he switched and what combination he made, he read about this exercise and he decided I am going to test this out for my treatment resistant people. So he designed similar kind of experiment where people who participated in moderately intense aerobics such exercising on a treadmill or a stationary bicycle whether it was three or five days a week experienced a decline in depression symptoms by an average of 47% after 12 weeks, 47% decline in depressive symptoms. Those is the low intensity group had a little less, 30% reduction but here is the thing that really blew his mind is that people who are unresponsive to medications did got some benefits from the exercise, all right. People who don't -- either the depression isn't alleviated totally by the exercise, by the antidepressant can use exercise as a supplement or people who don't respond at all to medication or aren't willing to take it, exercise could be the best thing for them. A produce study, this is a correlational study, found the middle aged runners who have been running three to five times a week for three to ten years were markedly less depressed than when they were compared to people who didn't run they were at the same age. Now that's a correlational study. Here is one and it's interesting, I know maybe you now about this, but there has been a lot of research recently about keeping your brain alive to crossword puzzles, and there are some brain training things on smart phones and on computers, it turns out when they had elderly people take some of these brain training things, if they increase their speed of brain processing, they also had less depression. So that's interesting. If they made their brains grow, less depression. So it's isn't always just physical exercise. If you can keep your brain going, you might be less depressed because that stress of depression either they led to depression or that depression brings on to your life tends to decrease the flexibility you have, the brain growth that you have. And you know sometimes when people come into therapy and their brains aren't on line because they are under such stress, they are not taking in what you are saying or if they are taking in they don't have that much volitional ability to start things, all right. So seniors who never exercised before in this experiment experienced a mood-lifting effect less depression and anxiety and better reported quality of life and regular aerobic exercise three times a week on alternative days for six months. So you can see these effects in people having exercise pretty strongly. Exercise worked as well as an antidepressant medication reliving minor depression in seniors and had the added effect of improving physical functioning such as walking more briskly obviously. Here is the thing, I started to exercise a lot. When I was starting to read this I was kind of a couch potato I didn't feel any mood-lifting effect but I wasn't depressed when I started exercising. It turns out that if you are depressed or anxious and that's a slightly different thing we won't get into here that you get the most benefit from moving, just getting yourself moving. You don't have to even go out and run or do the exercise, just getting yourself moving is really important. So they also found reductions in anger and anxiety through exercise and the effect increased with the amount of exercise. So the more exercise generally the better. Obviously, you got to be aware of over training. Most of us aren't in any danger of over training. Over training means that you exercise several times a day, your training levels are at or near your maximum. I have never done this. It's only for anorexics or compulsive athletes who are really going for the gold. Most of us won't be in danger of over exercising, but I do need to put in that caveat, right. Okay, so how do you translate this into clinical work, especially with people who are depressed and say I can't get out of bed, you might be the key to getting them started in this brain growth direction. The next time you do a session with somebody who is really depressed in the hospital, in your treatment center in your therapy office, get out and walk. Do a walking session. Go to the mall, go outside if it's warm enough, walk around the block, even one time around the block can start to reverse this stuff. And obviously encourage patients or clients to move as much as they are able, park a little farther from the store and walk a few more feet, all is obviously would be good for their health in general, a little more movement is good for everybody. And I always talk to my folks about moving, not exercise, because some people have an antipathy to exercise and they are, I don't exercise, I say, that's fine, you don't need to exercise, I just want to get you moving because it's going to be part of what could -- and I explain this whole thing about brain plasticity and brain growth, I want to get your brain back on line and really support you even if you are taking medication or the other work we are doing, this could be the really crucial kind of thing. So we are coming to the end of our time. We had a whirlwind tour, I told you that it is going to be no faster than this and I am little hyper. I got through all of the six in this time, you are welcome to get on my website where I will put up these slides and I will put up -- I send PESI ahead some handouts and I thought I was going to cover two and then I saw there are scripts that said six, that's what I was going so fast and so I will put up some revised handouts that will have the references that I have talked about and a little more expanded materials in this. I keep this up on my website. I will keep it up all through the 2013 because some of you aren't watching a live webcast, you are watching this on a DVD or you are listening to this on a CD, so just go to billohanlon.com, click on free stuff and then the other stuff will show up and one of the things to show up is slides and there are other slides on there. But I will put these slides on there and I intend to keep them up all through 2013. If you garage this after 2013, sorry, you are out of luck, but most people should be able to get it by then. I hope this has given you some new insights, has probably reminded you of something that you had known before, hopefully has given you some new ideas. Anybody who is depressed needs everything they can to help move them out of it, medications aren't enough for people, medications don’t work for some people and some people they work partially, so I hope these six alternative approaches could relieve some suffering in the world. If you can have one person that I have just said that wasn't helped otherwise is worth the price of the mission. Thank you for taking the time to do this. Thank you to PESI and all the support staff that makes these webcast and the recordings happen.
