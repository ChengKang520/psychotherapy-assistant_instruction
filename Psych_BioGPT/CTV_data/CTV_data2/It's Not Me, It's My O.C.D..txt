Aquarius HEALTH CARE VIDEOS In Harmony with the Heart “It’s not me, it’s my ocd.” OBSESSIONS/COMPULSIONS 

00:00:40
GARY BRUSSELL Okay, here is the thing, you are known as a checker. You are list maker, you are a checker and you are a straightener. Those are my main areas. And I…I think they are just embarrassment you know… Where was I, what was I talking about? I need Thomas Guy(ph) just to get back to my act. Boys paid (inaudible ). I got to find the grid. 

00:01:00
MARCEY WALLMAN And this is…this is not charm(ph) So, I’m doing this willfully. And my whole life, I don’t think anyone has ever tried harder to just be a good person. 

00:01:20
ELIZABETH HERRON Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a heartbreaking disease that afflicts 2.5% of the American population. This is Judith Rapoport, MD, Chief of Child Psychiatry, the National Institute of Mental Health. In 1989 Dr. Rapoport wrote the book, “The boy who couldn’t stop washing.” This book became an international best seller and for the first time, made OCD understandable to the general public. 

00:01:45
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT , M.D. It’s a disease in which thoughts and rituals run wild not the everyday kind of preoccupation of did I locked the car door or um… did I turn off the gas, but where these thoughts and rituals take over in your life, waste your time in a serious way interfere with your living. 

00:02:05
GARY BRUSSEL There is a shame that isn’t enough that I have enough problems that I… I never hold a steady job, I've never been married, I never had a girlfriend for more than a couple of years. My parents are dead, my brother has been in five mental hospitals, isn't that enough or you all see of OCD, we forget to tell you. So there was kind of the thing like what else I got? Am I Hitler or am I or I got three personalities? 

00:02:25
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT Really, the story of OCD is ah… particularly interesting to me because when I started my own training in psychiatry, OCD was used as an example of the most purely psychological disorder. Here with these very well functioning people with a very circumscribed problem who otherwise rational and normal. And now, OCD has become one of the best examples of very elegant cutting edge research on the neurobiology. 

00:03:00
NEUROBIOLOGY 

00:03:00
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ , M.D. Dept. of Psychiatry & Behavorial Sciences UCLA School of Medicine The lower part of the front of the brain called the orbitofrontal cortex which sits right over the eye sockets. We found about eight years ago, that…that part of the brain is using too much energy. 

00:03:15
OCD 

00:03:15
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ It’s using more energy than a normal person’s lower part of the front of the brain would use. And the word we use for that is hypermetabolic. The orbitofrontal cortex in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is hypermetabolic. 

00:03:25
theories: ETHOLOGY 

00:03:30
ELIZABETH HERRON Is it possible that some animal behavior can give us a valuable clues about OCD in humans? 

00:03:40
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT Ethology is the study of animal behavior, one of the interesting things with some of the grooming or washing rituals and as whether or not, the hardwiring in many of these innate animal behaviors could be the types of circuits that are getting triggered in humans. Because if you are biological psychiatrist and think that this could be a biological disease, anything as complicated as washing and counting and praying. You wonder about hardwired behavior patterns. 

00:04:10
HEREDITY 

00:04:10
SHAWN A. KOENEN I, myself have been told over the last few years that I have a mild case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. 

00:04:15
GREG May be severe. 

00:04:20
SHAWN A. KOENEN And I have also been told that um… there are other people in the family that have several people in the family, that have OCD, cousins and siblings. 

00:04:35
GREG KOENEN Well, my mom has some of it too, but she like…she doesn’t like when people crack their fingers and everything, so, I think it’s kind of auditory(ph) and as I get a lot of people have it. 

00:04:45
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT What we know for sure is that OCD runs in families. This may be even more self for children but for children and adults much greater than you'd expect by chance, you find a close relative who has OCD. 

00:04:55
GARY BRUSSELL I do a lot of thinking about my childhood and that’s when I began to realize, I was making list. My dad would check door knobs and door locks and everything. My dad was a checker and I’m a checker. And he was pretty bad. 

00:05:15
symptom: CONTAMINATION 

00:05:20
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT Perhaps, the most common symptom in OCD of both as a ritual and preoccupation is the notion that by some kind of contact, it can be magical as by thinking and incidental contact by touching a door knob that someone has become contaminated or poisoned or has a disease such as AIDS in spite of the fact that…that kind of contact in reality does not cause anything. 

00:05:50
JOYCE CERRONE I have to be very detailed about what I’m doing, I'll make sure that I get under each nail, and then I kind of feel like I have to scrape anything or anything that might be under there out and that will not go and you know over and over again and… and do it. On the other side, again very detailed making sure that I get each finger all the way up and down. I was actually taking spraying cans(ph) of aerosol disinfectant and spraying in the air around me as I would coming through the door you know and the air down the hallway you know into the showers, sprayed my way because I was contaminated. 

00:06:30
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ An Obsession by definition in its most classical form is clearly understood by the person as bizarre and ridiculous. The fact that the person is thinking that things are dirty or thinking that things need to be checked, they realize that because they have already washed and because they have already checked, it doesn’t really make sense. It’s…it’s nonsensical to be thinking about that. 

00:06:50
symptom: CHECKING STRAIGHTENING 

00:06:50
GARY BRUSSELL One of the reasons I couldn’t finish the meal is because during the meal, I would jump up three, four, five, six times and go and open the window or crack in the bedroom, then I would walk in to the bathroom and see if the windows were correct there and if the lights were off and with my toothbrush there I'll rinse because I’m going to use it later and I'd have the toothbrush and the toothpaste ready for using it later after I eat. So, I would spend so much time walking around the apartment. It would take two hours to eat. I have a huge desk at home and it’s a very executive and everything and I have the things listed there all linear. I mean everything is stacked. I have the books and the papers and my routines and this and that. This just has no…has no order to it. It doesn't have any order. So, what I would do…these all have to be together because there is a similar shape and they've to be tucked and I would have them tucked into there, they’re like a family. And each of the same size, so I would have those there, because it was routine and you always line up the checkbook will be perfectly lined like that. This would be over there and get rid of this little stuff because, it…it’s going ah… it’s clutter, you no need clutter and keyboard must be lined up correctly underneath that probably with equal space on each side. This have to be like that. The cords would have to be… no cords on the table because that's just… you can’t have cords because cords mean there is disconnection. There is a connection that hasn't been connected and that’s going to be anxiety producer. 

00:08:30
symptom: HOARDING 

00:08:35
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT Hoarding is a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in which people are unable to throw anything away, no matter how useless it is such as old envelops, junked mail, chewing gum wrappers such that it becomes a disorder which means it really interferes of the use of their home. 

00:08:55
DINDO You know the saving compulsions are um… is just hard for me to throw things away. When I…When I was younger, ah… the OCD um… manifested in different ways like being too neat ah… either have my shirts stacked up in the cabin at certain way and they had to be in a certain angle. The reason for a saving compulsion is… is the OCD which is a chemical imbalance in… in the brain like I tried to be neat. So, I think the word slob is a… it’s a mis-normal(ph) for a… for a person who has saving compulsions. 

00:09:35
RELATED DISORDERS 

00:09:40
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT Many people I ask about whether other disorders are in and out of OCD. People who pulled their hair all the time at disorder named trichotillomania the question is is OCD or not, other people who may worry about how they look particular feature in their body or their face look all the time also called body dysmorphic disorder. Ah… those are questions that come up regularly to researchers in the field. 

00:10:10
MARCEY WALLMAN I'd began um… tearing at my face. I would get into the mirror which I still do. I would come up real close and examine in it. I’d always find some imperfection and I would squeeze and I would end up with sores. And then I couldn’t go out. I couldn’t leave the house. I didn’t want to go anywhere. It’s a big problem. I’m so self-conscious that I’m not able to walk around freely the way the other people do, take a walk, go to the mall. I can’t do that. Um… I mean, I tried to force myself the best way I can describe it's like being naked. I just feel exposed, I feel as though not everybody is looking at me, but that I’m being noticed. I can be in the car and if my hands are on the wheel, I think that the drivers next to me can see my nails or a pimple. I'll panic if something like this is missing. I don’t mean panic as in suicidal but I would really be uncomfortable and this is what I’m doing. The searching is goes on all the time. We have the dental floss, we have the sewing kit, we have Tylenol, we have several breath remedies here. We have the internal as well as the tic tac which I’m not finding. 

00:11:35
CHILDHOOD ONSET 

00:11:40
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT OCD in many cases is very similar in children. When they are really young, they have to be different. For example a child of two and a half who circled manhole covers over and over again ah… when crossing the streets in New York when he got to kindergarten age in which he is able to hold a pen, ah… pencil was a… his main symptom was making zeros over and over again on the page. So, there are certain age differences. 

00:12:05
GREG KOENEN Kind of a long story, but I guess I'll tell you some of it. And um… like chicken, I don’t like chicken and greasy things like chips, hotdogs, hamburgers, French fries, Tater Tots and everything that sticky like finger food, I mostly had to wash my hands after chicken. I was afraid that everybody won’t wash their hands. So, that… so, we made them wash their hands and I go even to the restaurants um… I made everybody wash their hands, but I don’t that anymore. And right now what my doctor was trying to say is like I can only eat a little soup or no soup at all because my hands are kind of would… 

00:12:50
JOHN PIACENTINI , Ph.D Director Childhood CCD Program UCLA School of Medicine The typical conceptualization of OCD ah… in adults and in probably older adolescent is that the rituals are performed to ward off or… or reduce anxiety associated with the specific fear like I’m afraid that if I don’t touch the lights, switch three times, something bad is going to happen. With the younger kids, you don’t oftentimes hear as…a…a specific obsession like that. Oftentimes, what they will say is that I have to do this because it doesn’t feel right if I don’t or I feel incomplete or it feels funny or it feels strange and as really almost very minimal anxiety um… associated you know a specific anxiety associated with the ritual that they do. 

00:13:35
GREG KOENEN Having an OCD is kind of a real because… because we have to do these things and you can’t stop them and many children they have it, it doesn’t, don’t have many friends, it’s kind of like you lonely and… 

00:13:55
JOHN PIACENTINI One of the big problems with OCD is the fact that not that many people still know very much about it. And there are a lot of people out there. Lot of children and adolescents as well as adults suffering from OCD who really don’t have any idea what the problem is that they are facing. Ah… a lot of the people that come into treatment um… that I see or that my colleagues see really come in and say they'd been having this problem for years and years and I just really had no idea that there was a name for it. 

00:14:25
SHAWN A. KOENEN I remember one particular day, walking by and there must have been 20 pairs of socks lined out on the carpet. And… and he didn’t ah… he didn’t know that I was walking by and watching and he was literally in tears, cried and I would just watching him, put the different socks on and off and on and off and he would just sit there with them all lined up. And we finally decided that we go to a doctor. We went to a child psychologist and he sent us to a child psychiatrist who talked us oh he has OCD and we really were not… we said okay. He has OCD, but we really didn’t know what OCD was. 

00:15:05
JOHN PIACENTINI A lot of… of the kids that we’ve worked with, have been very good at hiding their symptoms, I mean I… I’m working with some adolescents that have hidden their symptoms even from their parents for as long as like 10 or 12 years. Um… you know youngsters that have the onset of disorder very young and this is because they were embarrassed or they didn’t understand what was going on, just didn’t tell anybody and tried to cover up the symptoms and that can really take a toll, a tremendous toll on the youngsters and once the family members find out at oftentimes can be real difficult for parents or… or other you know close relatives or friends to understand how come, they weren’t able to find out. 

00:15:45
GREG KOENEN The way I cope with OCD is by trying to hide it so no one will know, but sometime when we you try and hide it, you can't hide it good enough and people find out about it in and then this some tease you and the thing you try to hide it, it’s a best then like my mom, my baseball coach wanted to tell everybody on the team about it. But then they would just tease me more so my mom said oh and but still they tease me and everything and then my (inaudible ) I said to my mom I told you should have told them and then few thing like those are few kids on the team were teasing me and go on like this in front of me and go on like this. And then my mom got kind of mad and then she yelled at some of them. 

00:16:35
feelings: ISOLATION LONELINESS 

00:16:35
MARCEY WALLMAN I just knew that I feel like a bad person. That was the message I got growing up that I was a burden and… and just bad. And um… my tendency is to isolate because I don’t have to deal with the hassle of trying to explain of um… trying to make people understand. 

00:17:00
GARY BRUSSELL I think being in denial but having it with you all the time, that (inaudible ) would be more frustrating than someone saying, this is a medical thing that we know about it. You are not alone, but driving in the car every night checking knobs and twitching around and checking the back door, reaching in the back seat to see that the jackets there that somebody might steal. That was somewhat frustrating because I didn’t know what it was I was doing. I only knew that I couldn’t stop. 

00:17:25
INSIGHT SELF-AWARENESS 

00:17:25
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT In general, patients with OCD have very good insight. And in fact one of the fascinating things about the disease is that the patients have been quite right to keep a secret because they have so much insight as to how a rational disease that when they do tell you about the disease, it’s something like a friend saying well, this is really very embarrassing. You got it and I’m not crazy, but I have these thoughts. For the most part, patients with say schizophrenia don’t feel that way. They really do hear the voices talking to them. They really do thing that if they pray a 100 times, the universe will be saved. 

00:18:00
JOYCE CERRONE The hardest thing about OCD is… is… is not like you know your some diseases, mental diseases where you don’t know what you are doing, you know what you are doing is really weird you know and… and that’s what really bother you, you're really mad at yourself you know you can be a very productive person and you know totally you know family, you know friends you know husbands, wives, lovers you know when it comes to when your diseases, it’s like it controls you. It’s like you’ve got to do it. You can’t deal with the anxiety any other way. 

00:18:30
DINDO I guess one thing, I really have to point out this, all these compulsions, I’m very aware of and I know there are senseless, see that’s what distinguishes the OCD patient from a psychotic who is out of touch with reality. 

00:18:45
JOHN PIACENTINI You… you’ll have parent’s feeling guilty you know I should have known, it’s my child you know. He or she has been in pain for this many years and I wasn’t able to recognize her help… or help them with it. And that… that’s something that we’re really has been a lot of time working on in treatment because it can be real devastating. 

00:19:00
JOYCE CERRONE It’s terrible for relationships because people that love you, they… you know they… even if they understand, they are… they get mad at you for being sick. My daughter used to scream at me that she thought I love… she said you love your sickness more than me. 

00:19:15
THERAPIES 

00:19:15
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT Over and above medication which has been clearly shown, there is a very good evidence that other behavioral therapy works, there is not good evidence that psychotherapy works. Psychotherapy may make well help other problems such as depression or relations with family members that happen in a person’s life with OCD. But the different behavioral therapies have been shown to work. Within each of the behavioral therapies, I think the best thing to say is that you need to individualize and be very flexible for some cases such as a classic contamination case without many thoughts. Ah… exposure with response prevention, traditional behavioral therapy may well be the best approach. For other cases, cognitive behavioral therapy may much better enlist the patient’s cooperation be much more useful for obsessive thoughts. 

00:20:05
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY 

00:20:10
MARGARET I was driving over to the valley and I saw some things in a trashcan which I thought were good. And here there was a piñata(ph) sitting out on top of a trashcan which is, which attracted my eye and for some reason, I felt that if I didn’t pick them up, I’d regret at later on and always would never be able to get it out of my mind. 

00:20:30
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ That’s an obsessive thought. I will not feel guilty if I leave that piñata(ph) in the garbage. I want to reattribute and say if my brain sending me a false message, but then you really want to do the hard work or refocusing. So, what we mean there is not just telling yourself oh I don’t really need it that helps, but you want to drive away. So, the first two thing you want to do is really realize why you are having that thought in the first place which is, this is OCD. Now, at the time… 

00:21:05
MARGARET Oh I know it’s OCD, but it’s still, I still feel, I need to have them. 

00:21:10
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ Exact, well, that’s… that’s really the key that the feeling that you are going to go and get it is not going to go away just by saying it’s OCD. That’s a different between the superficial realization and the deep realization. 

00:21:25
Because we had these pictures of the brain showing that the lower part of the front of the brain was hypermetabolic was using too much energy, the idea occurred to me to say why don’t I show the patients these pictures? 

00:21:35
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ This part of the brain right here, this so called caudate nucleus which is the part of the brain that would shift from go get that out of the garbage to, no I’m just going to drive away since you get stuck in gear when you make the effort you actually change the function, you change the way your brain actually works so that you’ll take care of two things at once when you tell yourself well, I’m not going to go to the garbage and… and… and take that out of it. On the one hand, you’re obviously be getting better in terms of not doing the symptom. But the second thing that we’ve shown is that you’ll change your brain while you do that behavioral modification. 

00:22:15
MARGARET But then, there is a good cycle where you ah… can get into the mode where you are feeling hey I did it and next time it’s going to be easier I know because that’s a promise of behavioral therapy and then I get the feeling better about myself. I get better self-esteem, I know that I can do things… 

00:22:35
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ And you remember you have a choice? 

00:22:35
MARGARET … and I remember I have a choice and then I just go ahead and the… congratulate myself for doing it and… and remember that next time, it’s even going to be easy. 

00:22:45
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ So important to remember to congratulate yourself. 

00:22:45
MARGARET Right. 

00:22:50
JOHN PIACENTINI Exposure therapy that Greg is… is what we are trying to do basically is break the connection between his rituals or the hand washing and his obsessive thoughts which in Greg's cases um… are associated with few of contamination. Ah… he just become very uncomfortable and very anxious when his hands are dirty. 

00:23:05
JOHN PIACENTINI Hey Greg, today we are going to do another exposure session. 

00:23:10
GREG Do I have to? 

00:23:10
EXPOSURE THERAPY 

00:23:10
JOHN PIACENTINI Yap, you have to. 

00:23:10
GREG Okay. 

00:23:10
JOHN PIACENTINI Okay. You want to um… let’s go over why we are doing this first, okay? 

00:23:15
GREG Okay. 

00:23:15
JOHN PIACENTINI Okay. Do you remember um… what the reason is for… for doing exposures? 

00:23:20
GREG To get on OCD better. 

00:23:20
JOHN PIACENTINI Ah…Huh… and the… what’s going to happen? 

00:23:25
GREG Um… I’m going to put the arm and… 

00:23:25
JOHN PIACENTINI And that was going to happen to your feeling thermometer? 

00:23:30
GREG It’s going to go down. 

00:23:30
JOHN PIACENTINI Ah… but what’s going to happen when you first put the potatoes chips on your hands? 

00:23:35
GREG It’s gonna of high. 

00:23:35
JOHN PIACENTINI Okay, it’s going to go up, right because you are putting grease and… and sticky stuff on your hands… 

00:23:40
GREG Okay. 

00:23:40
JOHN PIACENTINI … and then what’s going to happen after they… this has been on your hands for a little bit? 

00:23:45
GREG It will go down. 

00:23:45
JOHN PIACENTINI It will go down by itself, right? 

00:23:45
GREG Okay. 

00:23:45
JOHN PIACENTINI Without having to do your ritual. 

00:23:50
GREG Okay. 

00:23:50
JOHN PIACENTINI Okay, and you go ahead… 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
JOHN PIACENTINI … kind a greasy huh? 

00:24:05
GREG Yap. 

00:24:05
JOHN PIACENTINI …like you put some oil, rub it in both hands, okay. Rub it around, okay. What is your feeling thermometer. 

00:24:10
GREG Now to ten. 

00:24:10
JOHN PIACENTINI To ten, well, so this is really hard for you. You’d being getting more anxious as you… your hands are be getting more stickier, okay. And what’s going to happen over a few minutes as you get used to this in your hand, what is your feeling thermometer gonna go? 

00:24:25
GREG Down. 

00:24:25
JOHN PIACENTINI It’s going to go down, right. It’s going to go down by itself without you having to wash your hands. With feeling thermometer as a measure of anxiety, we'll the patient give us frequently throughout treatment, a feeling thermometer rating of anywhere between zero and 10 for children and adolescents, but see if we can get it to come down, below where you started from. 

00:24:45
GREG Two. 

00:24:50
JOHN PIACENTINI To two, great. Very good that means you… you are hardly anxious it all, right? You are getting stronger and your OCD is getting weaker. 

00:24:55
GREG It’s kind of like a battle where I'm winning. 

00:24:55
JOHN PIACENTINI But, you are winning, that’s right through a lot of hard work. Most of the successful programs for OCD especially in children, adolescence we'll use some kind of a metaphor to help motivate the youngster to go through treatment. So, it’s Greg talked about it being a battle where he is… he is getting stronger and the OCD is getting weaker. That… that’s a really important cognitive point to make, because it really helps to motivate him. 

00:25:20
GARY BRUSSELL There is a club in town, were you only get three minutes to do showcases, come on, it takes me as long as you stop twitching. We get add that to the time when… 

00:25:30
GARY BRUSSELL Becoming more honest and more open on stage, I don’t do the act know that I did a couple years ago where… with just a bunch of wise cracks and joke… jokes you know I talk a lot now about my life. 

00:25:45
GARY BRUSSELL I grew up maladjusted, I'd became the third person in my family to need counseling and take brain drugs and so forth. And what I found is, I've been going to my counselor lately because I find he is too Hollywood of a guy you know, they first called them up and I said, I have a lot of problems, I want to see you and he said, send a tape. Inside staff, you don’t need to know that stuff folk. I saw the nightmare most from tales from the crypt, that’s my life. (inaudible ) small tangent, I got a vasectomy last December, all stocking, stuffer for myself. 

00:26:25
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ The fact that person can use mental activity and knowledge to change how their brain works is perhaps the most exciting thing that has come out of all of this research that we have done. 

00:26:35
JOHN PIACENTINI In an (inaudible ) that we see commonly with kids and treatment is that it really has very dramatic and positive effects on their sense of self-esteem. They often times become much more outgoing, feel much better about themselves, much more confident in their abilities in other areas as well such as school or with friends or within family and then that’s the real positive benefit. 

00:26:55
JUDITH L. RAPOPORT This is an example of a real revolution in psychiatry that when I started studying, there has a problem 25 years ago. They really weren't any effective treatments, people are ashamed of the disease and weren't coming forth when they did come forth for treatment, it was a mistake. They didn’t get anything useful. Now, it is totally different. It’s not only been very much the stigmatized, but between drugs and behavioral therapy, I’d say, 85 or 90% of people get major important help.
