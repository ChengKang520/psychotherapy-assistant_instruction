BYRON WALLER  Money and finances are the number one conflict that many couples have. In fact, money has become one of the major issues with those in the United States have become divorced. Financial issues and financial infidelity impacts their entire relationship. Not just – just having the money. In my private practice I have an opportunity of working with John and Karen. A couple who’s in their mid 40s. Who have been married for 10 years. And who have been – who’ve dated five years prior to that. Within their first year of -- of dating, Karen came to John and asked John for a financial loan in order to save her home. Well, John thought about that decision and he contemplated it because he said he didn’t want money to become a major issue in their relationship so early. So in thinking about whether he was going to loan her the money, he decided not to. And he told Karen that he would lend her the money. And so Karen asked someone else who gave her the money. She was able to save her home. And she paid the money back. But that was the last time that John and Karen had an honest discussion regarding money. They came to me because they were experiencing, uh, some lack of intimacy. A matter of fact, they had moved into separate homes, and established relationships – established their own lives very separately. This is an example of what happens when the couples are not dealing with their financial issues and actually talking about it. There was a Harris poll where they asked 1,800 couples about their opinions about money and finances. And they found that 47 percent of the couples stated that they did not talk about money prior – prior to getting married. And of that 47 percent, they said 51 percent of those did not know how to have a discussion about money with the person they’ve already married. 29 percent admitted that they lied about money. And 37 percent of the couples reported that they argued more about money then about sexual issues or sexual intimacy. Money and finances has continually become an important and intimate part of the relationship. In fact, if money is a problem, intimacy and trust becomes a problem. Now financial infidelity that we’ve been talking about is a deceptive and dishonest way in which a couple will use money within their relationships. Often times these ways are secretive and they’re harmful to the relationship. In fact, financial infidelity has been seen to be as harmful to the relationship as sexual infidelity. Let me repeat that. Financial infidelity has become as important in many relationships as sexual infidelity. I know for many people, uh, they may question that. But we can see the impact of financial issues on relationships. Because when a person’s able – not able to honest when it comes to money then they cannot demonstrate their closeness and their ability to trust. Because financial infidelity will impact intimacy, financial infidelity will impact trust within relationships. Because what we’re looking for within these relationships is this ability to connect. And that is what really intimacy is all about. The ability of one person to feel close to another person. To feel informed about the other person. To even be able to share ideas about – with the other person. So intimacy is an important part and being able to talk about issues of finance and money allows for that intimacy to occur. Now, there are many different types of intimacy. We know that. But in matter of fact, I’m going to just mention four times. There’s physical intimacy, there’s emotional intimacy, cognitive intimacy, and experiential intimacy. And financial infidelity will impact all four areas of intimacy. Could you image if you had an argument with your – your partner, your spouse regarding money. You don’t feel about – you don’t about having financial – excuse me, having, uh, physical intimacy at that time. Nor do you really want to have emotional intimacy, cognitive intimacy or experiential intimacy. You don’t really want to do things together. Matter of fact, when you had that type of dis – disagreement, you would rather keep the distance. And with distance there is no intimacy. And as I stated before, financial infidelity could impact relationships by decreasing intimacy and decreasing trust within the relationship. Now we know that people that have different ideas when it comes to money. For some people, money is an extension of themselves. And it’s not just something that they possess. It’s how they identify themselves. A matter of fact, it’s part of their identity. They might see themselves as a particular type of person. So it becomes an extension of themselves. In fact, it also is a way in which they feel esteem. They feel actually see success and safety. So money is really an important piece in how a person might see themselves. You see, people might cheat for financial, uh, infidelity for a variety of reasons. They might cheat because they might have issues with power. They may feel like, if you have money, then you have power. And so therefore they don’t want to communicate regarding what that relationship might look like if they’re willing to share, uh, that money and therefore they have to share power. Or many people will use money as a way of full – finding fulfillment within the relationship. Or many might use it as a way to reduce stress. How many times have you heard, that a person is really stressed out. And the one thing they say that they can do in order to relieve their stress is to go shopping. Let’s go and purchase something in order to feel better. So many people will use money in that way. Or some people will use it because it allow them not to be committed in the relationship. A matter of fact, to keep distance, uh, so they don’t have to deal with intimacy. And many people might – might, again, get involved in financial infidelity because of their backgrounds. Some people who may have been – grown up in poverty tend to treat money very differently. And those who maybe more affluent may – may treat money differently. So each individual may see money and therefore financial infidelity as very, very different. When we look at financial infidelity, and when we look at money, I think a good analogy of what money might look like within a relationship is that, it’s like a car. Some of us have different types of cars. Someone would have BMWs and Mercedes. Some might have a Nissan or a Honda. And others may have smaller cars. But all of us have different types of cars. Just like we have different types of relationships. But the value of the car is that it allows you to get from point A to point B. And matter – matter of fact, it is the gas in the car that allows you to move ahead. Well, within relationships the car is like the relationship. And the gas is like the intimacy and the trust that you have for in relationship. It allows for the relationship to move forward. And when someone commits financial infidelity they are removing the energizing fuel to allow the relationship to move forward. So it shows how important it is to have financial trust. Now, couples and individuals within relationships may tend to treat them very differently. There are some gender differences here when we begin to look at how we might look at financial infidelity. A matter of fact, this Harris poll that was conducted indicated that women cheated more financially then men. And I know many people may be surprised at that. But here women will cheat more financially then men because of the idea that they handle the household expensive – expenses. And so therefore they had more opportunity and may see it very differently. A matter of fact, women, they say, according to the survey, women are, uh, actually learn about how to handle money through the mothers, and their grandmothers. There’s a Jewish word called, a knipple, a Yiddish word. It’s – in which it describes how women will hide away money, uh, and save it over the years in order to demonstrate – uh, in order to make sure they have money for a rainy day. And so women will tend to put away a little money. And women tend to – to cheat in a smaller way. When they purchase those daily types of things. Men on other – on other hand, cheat very differently. They cheat in a big way. Whether it’s putting money aside or whether it’s buying that 60 inch television without having some agreement. Or even buying a car. There was this commercial that I saw on – on television in which – it was an insurance commercial where the representative was standing and the parent – excuse me, and the couple came in front of us the, uh, the representative. And they say they wanted to insure their things. And so they asked for insurance. And then you saw a house going by. And the couple says, yes, we want to insure the house. And then you saw a car goes by. And the couple says yes, we want to insure the car. And then the wife was ready to say that’s all we have. But then the man says he has other things. Then you saw a motorcycle goes – go by. You saw an RV go by. And which the wife didn’t know that the man had these other things. And that’s how men tend to cheat. They cheat on larger things, uh, so it’s very different in which – how the woman might cheat and which the man might think – cheat. But it’s still cheating. And we rec – recognize that cheating when it comes to money will impact the relationship. It will destroy intimacy and it will destroy the trust. So the question is, what do we do. What do we do when a – we find that a couple comes for counseling or comes for help when they have had evidence of financial infidelity. Well, there’s seven things that we can do. I want to suggest seven things that can be done in order to help the couple to recover the intimacy and the trust within that relationship. The first thing that they can do is to create a space of safety for each of them. Because we know if this is the first time a person have an opportunity to talk about money, it can be someone nerve wracking and uncomfortable. So you create the space of safety where they can begin to talk about money. So you establish clear ground rules in which they will follow. And you also asking to be as open and honest as possible when talking about money. So that’s the first thing that we can do. The second thing we can do to help couples to restore intimacy, uh, and trust within relationships is to give them opportunity for them to talk about how they use money. How do they view money. Because as we said earlier, people see it very differently. And they need to begin to have the conversation about how they might view and use money. The third thing that we – that we can help people to restore intimacy is to actually talk about the financial infidelity that was done. So they can clear the air and start off from the beginning. Because that again, will reestablish the trust that was lost. And hopefully reestablish the intimacy. Because the person’s willing to work through things. Now – now the next steps are going to be a little bit more practical what the person could do. Step number four, uh, they need to make agreements about how they’re going to manage money. Make it clear so both of them understand how it’s going to be done, what the consequences might be, uh, if they move out of this clear understanding of how they will use money. Step number five, you put them together to make a – a budget. You help them decide on the structure of the relation – the structure of the budget. What it will look like. Who will be responsible for things. How they want it to be structured. Do they want one account or do they want several accounts. How they will want to structure is really important to beginning to restore that trust and intimacy. And the seventh thing that can be done here is to develop a schedule for which both of them, yes, both of them, will come together to manage the money. Not just one. And to be very clear about how they’re choosing to become again, close again. Now this issue of financial infidelity it will -- if not used and – and treated correctly, it will impact the intimacy and the trust within relationships. And if – if we continue to ignore it, we’ll continue to see many other relationship conflicts. Thank you.

SHANNON DERMER Dr. Waller, thank you for that very interesting, uh, presentation. 

00:15:15
BYRON WALLER Thank you. 

00:15:15
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:15:15
SHANNON DERMER And I imagine that, um, we might see even more financial infidelity with all of the financial problems that our society has had in the United States over the last five or so years. Uh, foreclosures and people being laid off and the stock market and things like that. Um, but I do have – I have a few questions for you, um, you said 47 percent of couples did not talk about money. So if you’re designing a premarital counseling program, um, what’s – how would you have couples talk about finances, uh, before they get in a committed long term relationship. 

00:16:00
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:16:00
BYRON WALLER I think, uh, as we talked about in the presentation there, it’s very clear to talk about what their view of money might look like. You know, especially most people feel uncomfortable talking about something that seem to be so close to them. So that’s one thing that I would suggest. Talk about what you think of money. And then how you plan to manage it becomes a really important piece of it. I’m glad that you said that it has – it should be one part of the premarital, uh, counseling, before marriage. Because we’re seeing that they didn’t talk after marriage. So that’s one thing that I would suggest. What’s your view of money. Uh, what have your experiences been in your families. Because that has been a major, major issue that establishes, uh, how a person might view it and use it. If a person comes from a, uh, poor environment, of course, how do they view it. How do they value it. How do they see using it. Or for someone come from a different type of environment. It’s important to be able to talk about it. So that each member of the relationships recognizes, this is how you view it, uh, and this is how I view it. And then I think one of the things I would do for – for sure, is to beginning the conversation on how they’re going to manage their money. Are they going to have one account, are they going to have several accounts. To be very clear about what they would look like for them. 

00:17:15
SHANNON DERMER So you’d been talking, um, in your presentation and now about, uh, some of the conversations you have. And one of the things, uh, I was especially interested in is you talk about, well it’s not enough just to talk about well, okay, we have two accounts or, um – uh, you pay this bill and I pay that bill. But what is the meaning of money. What is the meaning you attach to it. You know, is it something fun, is it for security. Uh, all of those things. Could you say a little bit more about how you talk – or help clients understand what the symbolism or experience of money is. 

00:17:45
BYRON WALLER Yeah. It becomes important, uh, for the couple to begin to talk about money, uh, and how they value it. How it really, um, help them to – to develop their own identity related to it. Because for some individuals, the money really means it’s me. It’s not –it’s not just, uh, an object. It’s really part of me. And you – can you imagine helping someone to have a conversation regarding, now this is something that – that it’s part of me. And we can begin to share that. So that’s – the way that we can do that. 

00:18:20
SHANNON DERMER So they have a relationship with each other but they also have a relationship with money. 

00:18:20
BYRON WALLER Yes. Yes. 

00:18:25
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:18:25
SHANNON DERMER And it’s funny because I didn’t know much about financial infidelity until more recently. Um, and now I can look back on some cases that I had across time, where it really was about financial infidelity inspect one of the first cases I ever had as a masters level, uh, counselor in training was someone who – he had lost his job. But was ashamed to tell his wife because his money was him being a provider. And so he got up and went to work every – work, every day. Pretended like he was going. Even thought he didn’t have a job and they, um, they got behind on their mortgage payments and all that. It wasn’t until they’re were about to foreclose on the house that that’s when the wife found out that – that he didn’t have a job. Uh, and there was another one that was actually here at Governors State University. That, uh, was really about that experience of finances being different. And, uh, the couple would argue over things about whether, like, the, um, wife would buy chicken on sale, let’s say. And he’d say, you don’t buy it unless it’s on sale. You know, and then you stock up and you stick it in the freezer. And she was like, but if I have a taste for chicken I would like to buy chicken. And they had very different means. For her, her father had died young. And, um, so and didn’t get to enjoy any of the money that he had saved. Um, and for, uh, the husband he had grown up very poor. And so every penny counted. And so it wasn’t about what you wanted at that moment. It was about need. And if you needed it, they you didn’t need to spend money on it. And it caused them a lot of troubles, that -- that experience and that meaning that they attached to money. 

00:20:00
BYRON WALLER Um-hmm. You know that’s really interesting because, uh, there’s a lot of research out there saying that the more that a couple argues about money, the more it may increase the possibility of divorce. 

00:20:10
SHANNON DERMER  Um-hmm. 

00:20:15
BYRON WALLER So, uh, there’s research talk about – at week, they might – they argue so many times during the week that will lead to more – of course, uh, lack of intimacy and trust within the relationship is over time. And will lead to the destruction of the relationship. 

00:20:30
SHANNON DERMER What’s interesting, uh, you talked a little bit about research and John Gottman, I’m sure you’re familiar with him. 

00:20:35
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER Um, talks or writes about meta emotion. And that he has some assessments for how people view emotion. And how, um, how they value either expressing or not expressing emotion. And he calls it, like, the meta emotion interview. And, um, in some of his research has focused on, if people are closely matched on their meta emotion, um, no matter what that style is, that they’re more successful in their relationship. And I wonder, uh, have you seen anything about assessing people’s meta financial styles and how closely they’re related and how that would affect. 

00:21:10
BYRON WALLER That sounds like it’s a new area that John Gottman can add, meta money. 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER Meta money. There you go. I like it. 

00:21:15
BYRON WALLER Meta money. 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER Show me the meta money. 

00:21:15
BYRON WALLER That’s right. What they can see, uh, how important, uh, each person in the relationship actually see the money and how they can really begin to make plans or how they’re going to do it over time. Before it becomes a problem. 

00:21:30
SHANNON DERMER What have you found with couples, do you find that, um, it’s either more or less successful if they want some separate accounts versus all shared accounts? 

00:21:40
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:21:40
BYRON WALLER One of the things that’s really most important in looking at managing money and – and financial infidelity, is that they made an agreement. That becomes the issue. There’s that financial infidelity – infidelity becomes more significant when the person had no agreement or they had an agreement and the person broke it. 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:21:55
BYRON WALLER So whatever structure that they decide and they follow it, is really the key in – in having this financial honesty that continues. 

00:22:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So it’s – it’s kind of a lot like sexual fidelity where people have all different kinds of definitions of what sexual fidelity is. You know, it can be, well you can’t go out to dinner with someone of the opposite or same sex – excuse me. I’m going to cough into my microphone for a second. Sorry. Um, but you can’t get – you know, that you can’t go out to dinner with someone without letting me know or else that would be cheating. And for other people it’s like, well I don’t care who you talk with or what you do as long as you’re coming to me at night. Or that people have different contracts. And it sounds like it’s not the particular contract it’s that they both know it, they both agree to it. And then they both follow it. 

00:22:45
BYRON WALLER That is the key. And – but with many couples, as we stated before, they have never talked about it before. Even to make that agreement. And so, as a premarital, uh, intervention you might say, let’s be very, very clear about what we think about money. Let’s make an agreement even before marriage. So that this does not become an issue further in the relationship. 

00:23:10
SHANNON DERMER Do you think people realize sometimes, how much power is associated with money. I mean, if you took a feminist perspective they would say, well there’s a lot of power associated with who makes the money, who gets to, uh, make financial decisions, how – you know, how they’re made, if both people get to contribute. Do you think the average person really realizes how much power is associated with money. 

00:23:30
BYRON WALLER I think those outside the relationship may not. Because we – because if they’re – we’re not in a relationship then, of course, they make all the decisions for themselves. And they use the money all for themselves. But then once they in relationship, and now they’re having to combine moneys or combine how they’re going to manage it, I think most people realize boy this is a little more complex than I thought. Especially when they begin to see how money and finances have impacted whether the relationships continue or not. 

00:24:00
SHANNON DERMER Um-hmm. 

00:24:00
BYRON WALLER So over time they do see that. 

00:24:00
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:00
SHANNON DERMER Do you think it’s easier – you know, the – you know we might it a traditional household where, uh, one person really is the head of the household and makes a lot of the major decisions. Maybe with the input of the other person. But do you think that, um, financial issues are less when there’s one person who’s head of the household. 

00:24:20
BYRON WALLER I would say, no. Because I think the major issue will be, communication. Does the other person know what’s going on. Whether one person is doing it, whether two people are doing it, as long as they communicate, have that agreement I think it works very well. Uh, within the relationships. So whether it’s one person or two, I don’t think really would matter. 

00:24:40
SHANNON DERMER Now what was the Yiddish word that you used, it was -- 

00:24:40
BYRON WALLER  Knipple. 

00:24:45
SHANNON DERMER Knipple. Okay. Um, the more of a hierarchy there is with financial decision making in that, it’s more one person who makes it, do you think it’s more likely that the other person who doesn’t have as much say in the financial decision making will squirrel away money, uh, do a knipple or – uh, do you think that there’s, um, more secrecy, uh, when there’s more of a power difference with finances? 

00:25:10
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:25:10
BYRON WALLER Oh yes. And – and power, uh, how committed I am to you, how open that I really want to be with you. Uh, how honest I can be with you. All of those will impact whether I can go and buy the – that person can buy that dress that they want. Or person can buy those shoes that they want. Because I feel as if I can be honest with you. I can share that with you. But if I don’t feel comfortable with you, I might put away a little money on the side. Because then I’ll go and purchase that – those shoes or the – those slacks because then I want to keep it away from you. So, I think it’s really important to be able – again, to talk about it. And make that agreement. Whether it’s one person or two. 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER So the less vulnerable, someone feel – feels they can be with the other person, the less open to influence, maybe the other person is the more likely they might need to stash away some money so they don’t have to have a discussion about. They can kind of do what they want without fear. 

00:26:10
BYRON WALLER A matter of fact -- 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER In the short run. 

00:26:10
BYRON WALLER Yes. Well in some, uh, relationships, they decide to set okay, you have an account and I will have an account. And we will have separate accounts and you can have money in there to do whatever you want to. And others – and so therefore they have a certain amount of freedom even when it comes to money. But again, it’s part of the agreement that they’ve made over time. 

00:26:30
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:30
SHANNON DERMER Right. Um, what – what do you think is going to be the biggest – if you’re looking into the future. 

00:26:35
BYRON WALLER Okay. 

00:26:35
SHANNON DERMER What do you see the future of financial infidelity being and how people – how clinicians, um, will deal with it. 

00:26:45
BYRON WALLER Just as we have done, a lot of research, and that we focus on sexual infidelity, I believe that we will begin to focus on financial infidelity even more. More research will be done. Um, more treatment will be done. Especially as we begin to see -- as many begin to see issues of hording and – and issues of – of addictions become even more apparent we’ll begin to see how the issue of financial infidelity it will become more and more relevant. 

00:27:10
SHANNON DERMER So you think people are going to start to specialize in that more, financial infidelity? 

00:27:15
BYRON WALLER I do believe that. Yes. 

00:27:20
SHANNON DERMER I did have to say, you mentioned it in your presentation, a lot of people are like, well, how can you compare that with sexual infidelity. And I had a friend one time he said, well I could forgive my, you know, partner or husband, um, anything except for if he had sexual infidelity or he put his hands on me. 

00:27:35
BYRON WALLER Um-hmm. 

00:27:35
SHANNON DERMER And when she said that, I was like, really, I’m not sure how I could forgive it if someone like wiped out my kids college account. You know, um, or who wiped out all our saves or things like that. I do – although money is only money it does have a sense of security. And gives you, uh, some flexibility in what you do. And people work very hard for it. Especially in this economy. So I have to say, I’m starting to understand more how – especially big financial infidelity, but even little bits of financial infidelity can be just as powerful as sexual infidelity. 

00:28:10
BYRON WALLER Especially since there’s really one – one of them – the top reasons for divorce in – in the US because of finances and money. 

00:28:20
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. I think people, you know, will say, oh yeah, well they fought about money so they – but they weren’t – I think it’s much more powerful to – to view it in terms of infidelity. Yeah. And I think that you are right, we need to wrap up a little bit here. But I think you are right about that it is going to be something that’s going to become a specialization in the field of counseling. Especially as related to addiction and to making better relationships. So thank you for letting us all know about financial infidelity. I want to thank all of you for joining us.
