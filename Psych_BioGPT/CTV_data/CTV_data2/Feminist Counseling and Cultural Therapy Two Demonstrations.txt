00:00:00
Mary Ballou, Ph.D. Professor of Counseling Psychology, Northeastern University 

00:00:00
DR. MARY BALLOU  Good day, my name is Dr. Mary Ballou. I am a faculty member at Northeastern University in the Counseling Psychology Program. I'm also the chair of the Feminist Therapy Institute and have been involved for several years with development of feminist therapy. We're working today with a brave young man- 

00:01:20
Client: Atsushi Matsumoto 

00:01:20
DR. MARY BALLOU - by the name of Atsushi Matsumoto and he has volunteered to come and share with all of us some of the difficulties he is facing in his life. This is not a role play nor is it an act or, it is a real person sharing their difficulties. Other therapists today who's going to bring us cultural psychotherapy is Dr. Martin LaRoche- 

00:01:45
Martin J. LaRoche, Ph.D. Assistant Professor, Harvard Medical School 

00:01:45
DR. MARY BALLOU - who is a psychologist who works- 

00:01:50
Director of Psychology Training, Martha Eliot Health Center 

00:01:50
DR. MARY BALLOU - with Harvard Medical School. Martin will be the second therapist working with Atsushi today. We also have a moderator who comes in for the last discussion of the session and that is Charity Tabol who works- 

00:02:05
Moderator: Charity Tabol Feminist Therapy Institute 

00:02:05
DR. MARY BALLOU - with us in the Feminist Therapy Institute and is also- 

00:02:10
Counseling Psychology Doctoral Student Northeastern University 

00:02:10
DR. MARY BALLOU - currently working at ABA Hospital as a psychologist. What we wanted to do today is to present both feminist therapy and cultural therapy because there is, ah, overlap and also some differences, and we thought it would be very instructive as we move forward in this journey of developing theory and practice in counseling and psychotherapy. I think what is really important to understand as you view the interaction in the tape and also the subsequent discussions is that both feminist therapy and cultural therapy come from different standpoints from theory and practice up to today, and they're both part of a current emphasis in the development of theory and practice that really gives credence to different standpoints and to values of justice and fairness and that ethics have become, and social change become really important aspects of psychotherapy, not something separated from the work we do with clients but brought into the counseling room and thought about in terms of the life experiences clients have. 

00:03:35
DR. MARY BALLOU  Each of us comes from the standpoint and with our own sets of values that need to be really explored and understood as both strengths and also potential limits. I think that the most exciting thing about the tape that's going to follow is that it presents you with an inside picture to some of the developing work in contemporary psychotherapy. 

00:04:05
Part 2: Feminist Counseling Demonstration Refer to Slide 1 for more detail 

00:04:05
DR. MARY BALLOU  Atsushi, first of all, I just wanna thank you for being willing to do this in coming here today. 

00:04:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Ah, you're welcome. 

00:04:15
DR. MARY BALLOU And I also wa, wanted to start with talking a bit about what you would like to talk about today. (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
DR. MARY BALLOU What, what kinds... (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
DR. MARY BALLOU ...of topics are there you would like to address today? 

00:04:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Uhm, well, can I tell you a story before I go in. Uhm, last week, I was talking to my parents who live in other country, on the phone and it was late at night and I caught myself getting ah, rather annoyed uhm, to talk into my parents late at night, which is something that had never happened before, and I was thinking about it for the last couple of days. I was asking a question as to ah, what was it that made me look ah, even annoyed, and it's not because I don't mind talking to my parents but the fact that I really thought that I was spending my own time to (sigh) talk to my parents which is awful, it just doesn't sound right. Uhm, and I realized that I really don't have time for myself. In general, I work hard. I go to school. I mean, grad school. I'm trying to finish my Ph.D. and by the time I get home, I am pretty much very tired and exhausted that I really realized that I really don't have time for myself and I just needed to talk about it with you to see how I can perhaps work with that. 

00:06:15
DR. MARY BALLOU  So, I take from your story that, that the lack of time is making you uhm, a bit irritable, a bit angry with extra demands? 

00:06:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right I think. (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
DR. MARY BALLOU Is that happening in other places as well, other relationships or other, other activities in your life? 

00:06:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uhm, definitely. Uhm, I think particularly with my friends that has changed drastically, I think. 

00:06:50
DR. MARY BALLOU  So, the pressure... (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
DR. MARY BALLOU  of work? (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
DR. MARY BALLOU And studies or dissertation is really, really the central part of your life these days. 

00:07:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Yes, definitely. 

00:07:10
DR. MARY BALLOU Tell me a little more about that. 

00:07:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uhm, sure. For example, ah, my dissertation, I know that I really need to get it done and then I know that I need to finish it. But the demands of my work is extremely high, and ah, it takes me several hours uhm, of lot of effort and time to do a good job, so that requires me to spend a lot of time to do what I need to do for work. So, by the time I try to work on my dissertation, there isn't enough time for it uhm, and I give myself excuse, "Okay, I'm doing my work so why don't I just try to move away from dissertation and get back to it when I have time in the future, so I keep putting it off, I think. And I think it, has a lot to do with the amount of work that I do and expectations that I give to myself that it has to be in a perfect condition, meaning that everything that I have to do, that I do, I want it to be good. I want it to be almost perfect. (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO So. (sigh) 

00:09:00
DR. MARY BALLOU So, work is really demanding for you and I'm wondering... (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:09:05
DR. MARY BALLOU ...about this perfect. Where does that come from? And tell me a little bit more about your work. 

00:09:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Hmm, okay uhm, work, uhm, what I do is uhm, to manage a couple of projects, different types of projects, a research project and it involves overseeing uhm, data collection, data entry and all those other things, and for some reason I feel that I have to do the best that I can do. For some reason I give myself this extremely high expectation that I have to do what I can do to get the best result that I can get so. 

00:10:15
DR. MARY BALLOU  Does that expectation comes from inside you or that somehow who you are, your value system says, "I have to do the best I can do," or... (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
DR. MARY BALLOU ...is it also related to the situation, are there particular demands there for you? 

00:10:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  I, I think it is both. 

00:10:40
DR. MARY BALLOU Let's talk a little about each. 

00:10:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Sure. 

00:10:45
DR. MARY BALLOU Let us talk first about the situation... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
DR. MARY BALLOU ...what are the demands on you there to do an excellent job? 

00:11:00
[sil.] 

00:11:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO You mean at work? (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Environment? 

00:11:05
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. Like who would be annoyed or who would evaluate you negatively if you did just a good job instead of an excellent job? 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  (sigh) I don't think of uhm, that I will be evaluated negatively... (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...or that there is this demand... (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...but in general, where I work, I tend to have very high expectations set already... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...that everyone meets that expectation so there is unstated uhm, unstated assumption that we all do meet that level so that's one issue at work, I think. 

00:12:05
DR. MARY BALLOU  So that expectation is part of what creates for you that demand and the need to do very good work? 

00:12:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Yes. Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
DR. MARY BALLOU What would happen at work if you didn't do that? 

00:12:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Hmm. I wondered. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
DR. MARY BALLOU If you. Yeah, if you didn't... (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
DR. MARY BALLOU ...meet that unspoken expectation that you do very good work and put in extra hours. (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. I wondered, I never even thought about that. Okay. 

00:12:45
DR. MARY BALLOU  So that would be an area to do some further talk and think... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. So on. 

00:12:55
DR. MARY BALLOU ...about that whether or not uhm, the demands of the work structure and the people there are uhm, as firm and uhm, clearly defined as you, uhm, explain some them to me. 

00:13:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm, sure. 

00:13:10
DR. MARY BALLOU  I supposed one of the ways to look at that would be to look at what has happened to other people there. (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
DR. MARY BALLOU Has there been a turn over? Has there been, you know some people who had been thought about as good workers and other people that had been let go... (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
DR. MARY BALLOU ...those are some of the ways to begin to kinda get to handle on what... (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:13:35
DR. MARY BALLOU ...the dynamics of the work place are. 

00:13:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  I, I think uhm, in terms of dynamics, I think it's very, in a way, stressful enough that I have seen other people being let go and... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...turn over is extremely high... (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...so I think that the thing that, seeing that also makes me feel that I have to do my best. 

00:14:10
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm, so it's not just the unspoken assumption of really hard work and extra hours. (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:14:15
DR. MARY BALLOU  But also there is uhm, when we, when you look at other people, there is some evidence that if you don't do it uhm, there'll be a problem. 

00:14:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh-huh. 

00:14:30
DR. MARY BALLOU  At work, are there some people who you could've considered allies or who share the same... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
DR. MARY BALLOU ...pressure... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and you get to talk about a little bit with? 

00:14:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Yes, definitely and we do talk and actually helped us to cope with the demand and the pressure. So I think that helps. 

00:15:05
DR. MARY BALLOU  I wanna switch- 

00:15:10
Exploring embedded assumptions 

00:15:10
DR. MARY BALLOU - if it's okay with you... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO It's alright. It's alright. 

00:15:10
DR. MARY BALLOU ...just a little bit back to you... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
DR. MARY BALLOU ...because we identified both of those areas as... (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
Refer to Slide 2 for more detail 

00:15:15
DR. MARY BALLOU ...or you identified both of them as... (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
DR. MARY BALLOU ...as important. (sigh) You, you said that it's important to you to do a very good job too... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and that it is related to how you see yourself and your values- 

00:15:30
Affirming individual experiences 

00:15:30
DR. MARY BALLOU - uhm, I'm wondering a little bit about that, about that your values as a person- 

00:15:35
Refer to Slide 3 for more detail 

00:15:35
DR. MARY BALLOU - and also whether there are some subcultural norms... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
DR. MARY BALLOU ...uhm, operating here for you? 

00:15:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  I, yes. I definitely think that it does have a lot, perhaps not a lot, but to a certain extent, it does have to do with my cultural ah, background and upbringing as well, I think. And I, I grew up in Japan. I grew up in a very competitive environment. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO So in a way I think I was almost trying to push myself so that I can do better. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uhm, and I think I had to do that in a Japanese educational system uhm, where I had to push myself to do better, better and better so that I can get better education in high school and so forth, so I think it is part of it. I think it has to do with my cultural background. 

00:16:55
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm, coming to United States and seeking advanced degree in American education in English... (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:17:05
DR. MARY BALLOU ...with different expectations must also be a real challenge. 

00:17:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Yeah, I think it has been. 

00:17:10
DR. MARY BALLOU  You talked a bit about uhm, about competitive environment in, in Japan and also needing to uhm, continue to perform and push yourself in the American educational system as being a part of what's going on for you at work. 

00:17:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Yes, I think. 

00:17:40
DR. MARY BALLOU But given your opening story ah, about irritation with... (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
DR. MARY BALLOU ...your parents, it seems to be at a point that's stronger than it usually is that you're at some kind of limit here and it's affecting your interactions. (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Definitely. Definitely. Right. 

00:18:00
DR. MARY BALLOU So tell me a bit more about that. 

00:18:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO At this point, I think I really do need to think about it and be able to prioritize what's most important for me and the fact that I realized uhm, that I was irritated uhm, when I was talking to my parents, that really made me to think that I do need to start thinking about my life in general. Uhm, in terms of having my own time for myself but also to spend time with other people that I care about... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...and I just felt that I need to voice it, ah, to a kind of talk about it so that I can really start thinking about it and hopefully make decisions about what I want to do. 

00:19:10
DR. MARY BALLOU So it's really kind of a choice point for you, isn't it? (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Right. 

00:19:15
DR. MARY BALLOU That the... (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
DR. MARY BALLOU ...demands, the pressure to perform to, to work well are really at a point where you feel as if you must do something about it, that it's delaying your dissertation and making irritable... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:19:25
DR. MARY BALLOU ...with your parents and also uhm, making you miss out on other relationships and parts of your ah, life. (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
DR. MARY BALLOU Stress has a way of doing that particularly if it's long-term stress. Yeah. Uhm. 

00:19:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  How would you deal with that it if may ask, ah, if you don't mind sharing it. I think that's, I assume you have busy life. I have, I assume you have things to do... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...and I often wonder how you also cope with that. 

00:20:10
DR. MARY BALLOU There certainly had been times in my life when I felt that, you know, I had been in an amount of stress. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
DR. MARY BALLOU Like you, I usually discover it when I get irritable with people. So I find that commonality between you and I about the reaction to stress. What you said earlier, Atsushi... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
DR. MARY BALLOU ...about time maybe don't look at your priorities... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:20:40
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and to make some decisions- 

00:20:40
Egalitarian relationships 

00:20:40
DR. MARY BALLOU - about how to order or maybe reorder those. 

00:20:45
Refer to Slide 4 for more detail 

00:20:45
DR. MARY BALLOU How to carve out some time in a day or in a week for you to enjoy some of your relationships and some of the leisure time activities. I think it's really very important... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
DR. MARY BALLOU  to do. (sigh) But I wonder if that's something you're gonna actually do or be able to do. 

00:21:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
DR. MARY BALLOU Ah, ah, I wondered that because you, you know, talked about your pattern for a very long time... (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:21:20
DR. MARY BALLOU ...in meeting those demands and exceeding the demands... (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and performing very well and having a tremendous amount of success in those ways. So, it's. (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Then I think it's going to be a challenge but I know that I, it's about time that I think that I need to do that. Uhm, I really never had the time to take care of myself. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  And I think it would be I'm beginning to think that it would be a good thing for me to do so that I could focus on my priority in a very, from a very different standpoint. 

00:22:05
DR. MARY BALLOU  So, it begs the question. What... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
DR. MARY BALLOU ...are those priorities... (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:22:15
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and what is that self-care? 

00:22:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. Uhm, For now I think what I really do need to do is to get going with my dissertation which is something that I have been meaning to do but uhm, I think it is about time that I should literally start working on it. But to do so, I realized that I have to also carve uhm, efforts that I need to put to do tasks at work so I need to be, I think I need to be able to draw certain bound, boundaries uhm, so that I could prioritize what I think I should, I should be doing. 

00:23:05
DR. MARY BALLOU  Okay. So, one of the things... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
DR. MARY BALLOU ...that would be really important to explore in future conversations would be uhm, that dissertation... (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh-hmm. 

00:23:20
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and what meaning and uhm, uhm, values to you... (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Hmm. 

00:23:25
DR. MARY BALLOU  that dissertation would be... (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
DR. MARY BALLOU ...rather than just another task to do. 

00:23:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. Definitely. 

00:23:35
DR. MARY BALLOU Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Definitely. 

00:23:35
DR. MARY BALLOU what is the meaning of that. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
DR. MARY BALLOU Certainly to explore ways of curbing some of the demands at work, (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
DR. MARY BALLOU of lessening some of that for you would be really important especially picking up on what you already do about talking with others to try to cope. (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Hmm. 

00:23:50
DR. MARY BALLOU  And I would want to add to that list... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
DR. MARY BALLOU ...where, if it's okay with you... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Sure. 

00:24:00
DR. MARY BALLOU ...for future discussions, ah, bit of talk about your life and what kinds of things give you pleasure, (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Hmm. 

00:24:05
DR. MARY BALLOU nurture you, and recharge your batteries and... (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
DR. MARY BALLOU ...making sure that there are some attention to that as well. So those would be if, if that's acceptable to you, (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO So. 

00:24:15
DR. MARY BALLOU those would be three areas for us to explore down the road a bit. 

00:24:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Okay. 

00:24:20
DR. MARY BALLOU Does that sound like it gets it or are there additional things? 

00:24:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO I think it does. I think. 

00:24:30
DR. MARY BALLOU Okay. 

00:24:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. MARY BALLOU Good.

00:24:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  Hi Atsushi. (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Hi. 

00:24:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE My name is Martin LaRoche and I'm glad that we can meet today. 

00:24:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Sure. 

00:24:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Thanks for agreeing to do this. 

00:24:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO No, that's fine. 

00:24:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE It must be kind of a difficult different situation for you. 

00:24:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO A little bit. 

00:24:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  A little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE The good thing is that I heard what Mary and you talked about... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:25:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...so I have already an idea... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...of some of the things going on and ah, I know you don't know me. Ah as I've said, 

00:25:10
The therapist directly and openly addresses cultural differences 

00:25:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  I'm, people call me Martin and ah, I am uhm, uhm, I'm from Venezuela. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Okay. 

00:25:20
Refer to Slide 6 for more detail 

00:25:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE So many people, when they talk to me they wonder where is he from? (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE I just wanted to share that with you. 

00:25:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Great. 

00:25:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE And I wanted to ask you... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...if uhm, there was something that you wanted to follow through after your talk with Mary. 

00:25:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  No, I'll just, if you could. 

00:25:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  Okay. Well, one of the things that I found really important was your first story. (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE It seemed like it was saying a lot about what's going on at this point in your life. 

00:25:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:25:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  It seems like it's quite unusual for you to get irritated. 

00:25:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO It really was and I, I was very frustrated, uhm, to catch myself actually getting irritated. Uhm, That had never happened to me particularly with my parents... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...uhm, because I don't talk to them often so when I caught myself getting irritated I was rather taken aback by it, myself. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE How were you? How were you getting irritated, and what were you feeling? 

00:26:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO I was just not listening to them. Uhm, I was acting as if I were but my mind was not there. So, basically I kept saying uh-huh and I was not really listening at all and I was also getting irritated in that, okay. How am I going to wrap up the conversation so that I can have my own time which is awful uhm, to even think of that way. 

00:27:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. And it was awful because? 

00:27:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Because ah, there was no reason for me to have to feel that way ah, with my parents. (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uhm, I have good relationships with them and I am very close to them and I just felt awful that I felt the way I did. I felt awful for the fact that I was getting irritated by it, (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO irritated by spending my time getting in touch with my own parents. So. 

00:27:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  And you have so many other things to do? 

00:27:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  I understand. And it seems like it's a good thing to if you cannot get in touch with your parents is kind of what, something that you have enjoyed and they seem to... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:28:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  like, is that correct? 

00:28:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Yes, it's something that we do on a weekly basis uhm, And I never, until last week, I really never had this feeling before. So uhm, I had been always enjoying conversations with them. So I just pretty thought that I need to talk about it. 

00:28:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. That makes sense. Sounds like a good idea. Do you think that if you were in Japan, (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE you would feel the same way? If you were over there and what do you think you would do if you were there? 

00:29:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Good question. Uhm, 

00:29:05
Narrate experiences and embed them within concrete contexts 

00:29:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  I do not know but I think- 

00:29:15
Refer to Slide 7 for more detail 

00:29:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO - if I were there, uhm, things would have been a little bit different in that I could see them in person more frequently... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...so I don't have to rely on weekly phone call communication that I have. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO So things might have been a little bit different. 

00:29:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. And do you think that if you get irritated with them... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...here or there, (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE would it be possible somehow to- 

00:29:50
It is important to explore cultural expectations that are influencing clients' behavior. 

00:29:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE - express that? 

00:29:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Would that be appropriate or not? 

00:29:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Probably not, (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO uhm, definitely. Uhm, no. I mean, I think if I were back home I think it will not be definitely appropriate to even talk about it. 

00:30:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Right. 

00:30:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO So, so for me to even talk about it here is very different uhm, experience. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Yeah, I can imagine. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Well(ph). 

00:30:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Yeah. I can, I can imagine that's unusual uhm, in this context to be expressing these feelings, but ah, one of the things that I heard Mary asked... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...was it seems like these feelings are also emerging in other circumstances particularly at... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...your job now. 

00:30:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...right, and I think it's not only in my job but I think my relationships in, (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...I play different roles in my relationships with different people. And it's not only in terms of work but I think in every different type of relationship that I have. This issue keeps coming up... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...and that's something that I have been noticing last few weeks or so. So(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Can you give me an example? 

00:31:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uhm, I think, for example, uhm, I have several friends who would ask me out to go out with them, (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh-huh. 

00:31:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO ...for example, and there are so many times where I have to actually turn it down because I really had to get things done at work. And that really is, that has actually caused uhm, tension between all my friends and myself so that really made me to realize that I need to change that. Uhm, that's one example, I think. 

00:32:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  So, when they want you to do something... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...and you can't, (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Right. 

00:32:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...and you say, what do you say exactly? Do you feel irritated? How do you, what, how do you address it with them? 

00:32:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO  Uhm, I usually, uhm, what happens is that, what I would do is to basically be honest about it and say, "Okay, here's what's happening..." (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO And as much as I would like to, there are things that I need to get done at work." 

00:32:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Right. 

00:32:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO And I would expect that my friends would understand it, but at the same time I feel that I should not be expecting them to really understand it either. Uhm, because I can always say no to work if I wanted to. 

00:33:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Can you say no to work? 

00:33:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMOTO Uhm, I think I should be able to. (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO And I am not doing that, (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Hmm. 

00:33:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...for some reason. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uhm, I think it maybe because of the pressure or the work environment. I am not learning to say no and that I have done my work and now I need to have my own time. I know that I should be able to say that but I don't think I have implemented it, (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  so that's. 

00:33:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Right, and you, and you were talking about how... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...there is this assumption at work... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...and that you are suppose to work extremely hard and not do things and do... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Yeah(ph). 

00:34:00
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...a lot, a lot of hard work. And one of the things you talked uhm, with Mary was about you wanting to do things perfect... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Right. 

00:34:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...and that, but also it seems to be that there is also something going on at work. That there's a context, as an environment, in which... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...there's a lot of pressure for you to work hard. And sometimes there is even more than that. There is like demands, like real demands. Like ah, ah, if you don't do this then, you know, you might not get this. 

00:34:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Hmm. 

00:34:35
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Is that it? 

00:34:35
Experiences are a result of a multiplicity of factors, including personal, relational and contextual factors. 

00:34:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. Yes. That is, yes, it's there. 

00:34:40
Refer to Slide 8 for more detail 

00:34:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  I understand. 

00:34:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  And ah, I think, you know I'm talking to you here, (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...helps me to kind of realize, "Okay, what kind of working environment that I'm in? Uhm, I'm involved in it. I am there everyday so I don't see that. But once when I step outside of it... (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Exactly. 

00:35:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  as I was just talking to you, it really made me to realize, "Okay, what is it?- 

00:35:20
Explore different contexts and their influences on client's behavior 

00:35:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO - What exactly is going on at work environment that I'm in?" 

00:35:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  And, you know, it does seem like that because as we talked about it you got really stressed... (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  and I'm, I'm gonna tell you one more thing and forgive... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO It's(ph) alright(ph). 

00:35:35
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...me if, and you can, uhm, I might be wrong about it but you can disagree... (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...with me... (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO It's alright(ph). 

00:35:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...so, feel free to, you know, say, "Hey, that's completely wrong." (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE But when, when I was saying there are pressures and like it seemed to me like ah, there was like a demand, a big demand on you that they were expecting you to do something ah, or else something else wouldn't happen. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE And(ph) would have to end(ph), what I noticed here was you were ambivalent to talk about that and maybe one of the things we can do here is, if you don't wanna talk about something just say, "Hey, I'm not listen, I'm ready to talk about that." (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Because it seems like that's one important thing for you to kind of address as we go along. And I know that's hard. You know, I know it seems like you wanna ah, you wanna be, please people but it might also be that in, in Japan that maybe it's hard to say no. It's, you're expecting, you know, I'm here sitting as a, as a psychologist... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  and it might be, you know, you know, he's, he's, he is a doctor in some ways and you know, you might assume that you have to answer any questions. But no, you don't. 

00:36:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  Correct. 

00:36:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE So, if you don't feel free, that's alright. 

00:36:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  So, you can say that. Was uh, was I in the right assumption as I was reading your gestures or? 

00:36:55
Clients are empowered to direct the psychotherapeutic session 

00:36:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Yes, definitely uhm, you are. 

00:37:00
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Alright, I understand. But it does seem like a very, 

00:37:05
Therapists can share their perspectives which is one of many possibilities not an absolute truth 

00:37:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE - very difficult environment. It does seem like there's all these pressures on you and- 

00:37:10
Refer to Slide 9 for more detail 

00:37:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE - ah, everybody is kinda pulling you in different directions and it seems like you wanna do ah, on some specific things and... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...at this point. 

00:37:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  At this point, yes. Uhm, I really need to be able to take care of myself better and to do it, I know that I want to do it. I know that I need to do it. And the more I realize that, it has been difficult as well to identify ways to do it... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...uhm, at work. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Right. 

00:38:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Because work environment still stays the same. And now I'm faced with challenges as to, "Okay, how am I going to do this?" Uhm, and I think I also need to evaluate ah, re-evaluate the way I think about what work should be in my life. How much time and space it should take in my life? Uhm, what is important for me? Is it my personal relationships with others? Do I need to sacrifice those things at the cost of doing good at work... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...so those are the things that are in my mind right now actually. 

00:39:00
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE I think those seemed like a very good goals, very, very good goals to kind of discuss, discuss further. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Right. 

00:39:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE And, and I, and I do think it might be useful to talk about these things. I know it's un... (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...it seems like it's unusual for you. It seems like you ah, keep a lot of things that if you don't mind me saying... (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO No, no (inaudible ). 

00:39:22
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...again, I might be wrong. (laughs) 

00:39:22
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO (Laughs) No, that's fine. Right, yes. Uhm, I, I tend to do that and it's very difficult for me to uhm, to share it with others and in, in a very first time(ph) meeting... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Right. 

00:39:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...with someone that I'm not particularly... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Right. 

00:39:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...uhm, that I feel comfortable with. So(ph). 

00:39:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  Good. Well, I'm glad and I know it's, I know it's a difficult. Ah, and here I am, somebody you never know from some other culture and you know, and that's, those are all important issues that I think... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Yeah. 

00:40:00
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...it's going to be useful to talk some more as... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...we go along, but I, again I wanna thank you. And I think your, you, your goals are very good and uhm, I think, you know what you need to do and we'll be happy to help you. 

00:40:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Right. 

00:40:15
Refer to Slide 10 for a summary of the Key Principles and Characteristics of Cultural Psychotherapy Part 4: Discussion 

00:40:15
CHARITY TABOL  So, we've just seen an example of a feminist psychotherapy session as well as an example of a cultural psychotherapy session with the same client, Atsushi. And now, we have an opportunity to ah, speak with the therapist and the client ah, about the key characteristics of each approach, ah, areas of convergence and divergence between them, and also ah, the experience of sitting in a session ah, of each of these two approaches. And it makes sense because these are so collaborative uhm, and they really emphasize ah, an egalitarian relationship with the client to include Atsushi in the discussion, and I just was wondering if you could speak to the experience of sitting uhm, with Mary. Let's start with her uhm, in that first session. 

00:41:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  Sure. Uhm, actually, this might pertain to both of them, but uhm, I really appreciated the fact that my concern was heard genuinely and that it was, I felt that it was validated uhm, so I appreciate that. And also, both of them actually touched on my cultural background and without really like (inaudible ) it(ph), and because it is, different from the demand, expectations and standard so I really appreciated that and that it really made me feel comfortable, and ah, it's something that I wanted to cite. And with Mary, uhm, although we didn't go into it in details, I think I really liked the way in which she wanted to evaluate or to explore more about the meaning of, of dissertation(ph) so that I would not take it as yet another task that I have to complete, and I think about what's really uhm, important and that's something that I really remember uhm, in speaking to Mary. 

00:42:40
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm, so it sounds like rather than making assumptions about ah, or imposing uhm, the therapist's meaning on your experience, they really... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Right. 

00:42:50
CHARITY TABOL ...tried to draw out what, what your personal meaning was. 

00:42:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. (inaudible ) 

00:42:59
CHARITY TABOL  I'm wondering uhm, if anything was different sitting with Martin and one of the things that, of course, feminist psychotherapy but also cultural psychotherapy ah, attends to is uhm, gender ah, (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Hmm(ph). Yeah(ph). 

00:43:15
CHARITY TABOL ...and I'm wondering if it felt different sitting ah, with a man or if that was. 

00:43:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  It is funny that you asked that question because I really did not uhm, feel gender was an issue... (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  at all and that's, at least, from my ah, perspective of the client. (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
CHARITY TABOL Sure(ph). 

00:43:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  I'm not sure about how uhm, Mary and Martin... (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...felt about it, (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO ...but. 

00:43:45
CHARITY TABOL Do either(ph) of you wanna speak to that or? 

00:43:45
DR. MARY BALLOU  I didn't feel uhm, I didn't feel that gender was ah, was really relevant uhm, uhm, phenomenon going on, but I did wonder a little bit about cultural differences... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
DR. MARY BALLOU ...uhm, in the sense that, you know, that I come from the dominant culture and ah, and that Martin identified himself uhm, as coming from... (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
CHARITY TABOL Hmm. 

00:44:15
DR. MARY BALLOU ...ah, Venezuela, and so, (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
DR. MARY BALLOU ...both of you shared other cultures... (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:44:20
DR. MARY BALLOU ...in your, in your histories. So, I wondered if, if that made any difference, sir. 

00:44:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO I think it did uhm, in a way, you know. When he mentioned about where he was from, I had this uhm, a kind of affinity and that we share a same experience, not exactly the same, but similar, ah, perhaps similar experiences so that it did have a little impact, I think. 

00:44:55
 Hmm. 

00:45:00
[sil.] 

00:45:00
DR. MARY BALLOU  I had another uhm, thing I wondered a little bit about too. Uhm, my ah, time with you came first and so we were uhm, talking about uhm, what your concern was and how to understand it and what might be related to it and areas to explore in subsequent conversations. And then Martin followed and uhm, emphasized more, you and your feelings and your experiences uhm, and there's a logical progression, and yet, the conversations were a little different. I wondered if that, how that was for you. 

00:45:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Hmm(ph). 

00:45:45
[sil.] 

00:45:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  In a way, I really uhm, I also picked up on that and I appreciate it, the fact that I could, that I was allowed to speak for myself, but at the same time, I noticed that it was very unique experience for me. 

00:46:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  Thanks again so much for, for doing this and uhm, I just wanted to share with you... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:46:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...that as I was sitting with you, ah, I could see that you were really trying to make things easy for me in some ways, which where(ph) I'm really helped me out as you are right now, and I, you know, and for a moment, I knew you, you know, that there were things that you don't wanna say and you don't wanna go... (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:46:35
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...to and I really wanted to be respectful about that. I really wanted... (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Right. 

00:46:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...to, to kinda be careful because this is, you know, this is about you... (crosstalk) 

00:46:45
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Right(ph). 

00:46:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...and I just wanted to see if that felt okay to you, if that was respectful ah. 

00:46:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  Definitely, yes. Uhm, you made it clear about that and it really helped me to feel comfortable with you and that you were kind enough to respect it, and allow me to draw the line as to how much I want to talk about. So, that was very nice, I thought. 

00:47:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE Uh hmm. 

00:47:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Thank you. 

00:47:20
CHARITY TABOL Which brings us ah, actually to one of the areas of commonality ah, between the two approaches is an emphasis on client empowerment and ah, one of the ways that that manifest itself and I, I observed it in, in both sessions was uhm, treating the client as the expert on his or her own experience rather than ah, being the dominant ah, powerful expert figure in the session uhm, and what I noticed about both sessions was that, Atsushi was uhm, given the, the power of uhm, setting the direction of the session ah, with his story ah, in the beginning of Mary's session and I wonder if you could both speak to uhm, that, the, the aspect of client empowerment that's so integral to both approaches. 

00:48:10
Redressing power differentials 

00:48:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE It was interesting when, (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...when I heard the story the first time. Uhm,- 

00:48:15
Refer to Slide 11 for more detail 

00:48:15
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE - when I was sitting and hearing Mary talk with you, (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...I remember that ah, thinking, "Oh, my goodness! There are so many different ways we can go in his story." And I was so glad that uhm, you kinda have decided ah, what was important and then Mary followed you with that, and when you, when I, and I wanted to go back to that because, because I really found it to be an extremely rich story with a, a lot of different possibilities and different elements while I had the multiplicity of possibilities... (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:48:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...and I want, when I presented it to you, you basically ah, said, "Okay, you, you put it on me," at that point, so that, so the challenge for me at that point was to give it back to you... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...so you could take charge... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...but, but I under, I kinda my feeling was that at that point, it was uhm, you're, you're kind of whirl(ph) a little bit, "Ah. Okay, I just did this. I need a little break. Take over. Take charge." And it could also be a cultural thing at some point. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE You expect uhm, the per, the psychologist, if it's male, if it's ah, a doctor, you know, to take... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...charge and, and it kinda follows through, so I kinda, I was... (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:49:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...also listening... (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Definitely. 

00:49:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ... to kind of that at that point and letting in, and gradually, kinda given you the power to take it to where you want it... (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:49:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...and I think again, it was very important for you to kinda say, "No, ah, I don't wanna go there," because it seemed to me like that was a consistent issue throughout the different... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...context that we talked about with your parents, at work...(crosstalk) 

00:49:50
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Right. 

00:49:50
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  ah, with your friends. So it's great that you could do some of that in the session. (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
 So(ph). 

00:49:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  Well, I think that was an example of... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...empowerment at that point. 

00:50:05
DR. MARY BALLOU And for me uhm, one of the, one of the basic principles of. of Feminist Therapy is the, the real validity and importance of ah, of people's experience ah, rather than necessarily theory or some expert judgment. It's, the things are grounded in people's experience. And, and there's also a kind of questioning stats about uhm, mainstream practices and uhm, conceptualization. So it's in, i, i, it's for those reasons that it was really uhm, important ah, to stay with Atsushi's experience... (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:50:50
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and uhm, and really centralize ah, one's... (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
DR. MARY BALLOU ...attention to that. 

00:50:55
Valuing all experience 

00:50:55
DR. MARY BALLOU It was a little, uhm, uhm, I don't exactly know, maybe demanding disconcerting or- 

00:51:00
Refer to Slide 12 for more detail 

00:51:00
DR. MARY BALLOU  -challenging maybe uhm, for ah, you to start with your story because it would have been very easy to follow that story into what it meant uhm, for you or your relationship with your parents or the distance between you ah, geographically ah, but I thought you were offering it as an example of what some of the tension is ah, in, ah, is doing to you. Uhm, and so I wanted to take it uhm, very much in that venue(ph), but it was, at that moment, a kind of challenge one, one's traditional therapeutic uhm, uhm, frame is to go with the experience of, of the client and the feelings and the richness of the story and yet I want also, wanted to go ah, with the uhm, the spirit that was offered in as an example of the stress so, it was ah, a bit of a challenge. 

00:52:00
CHARITY TABOL Yeah. 

00:52:00
Questioning norms and standards of traditional mental health 

00:52:00
CHARITY TABOL Some other uhm, elements that I wanted to just call attention to that I think also fall under- 

00:52:05
Refer to Slide 13 for more detail 

00:52:05
CHARITY TABOL  -this aspect of client empowerment were one, ah, Mary ah, and Martin actually both used ah, you both used self-disclosure. Uhm, Mary in speaking a bit about how you deal with, with stress or how you noticed stress ah, in yourself and Martin, of course, your ah, your cultural background. Uhm, and, and also there was ah, a bit of what I might think of as uhm, transparency to what you were doing in the session which, ah, sort of, you know, what you're going to do now and that Martin, I really ah, it struck me when you said, "You know, I could be wrong about this and this is what I'm, ah, this is just ah, a possibility," and it seemed like you both spoke in terms of possibilities rather than ah, truths. 

00:52:50
DR. MARY BALLOU  My sense about the empowerment and the transparency is uhm, is that, that's a real sort of dynamic process in a way. Ah, I felt that ah, that Atsushi and I were in a conversation together... (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
CHARITY TABOL Hmm. 

00:53:10
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and ah, I didn't feel some sort of responsibility for uhm, figuring out what was going on. It really felt like together as two human beings, we were going to try to sort this out. (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
DR. MARY BALLOU And so, uhm, you know, rather than a kind of structure or a product or something about giving empowerment it, it's mo, much more experience for me like a, a collaborative approach. 

00:53:40
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
DR. MARY BALLOU You're two people are in, it together to try to figure this out that Atsushi was really the expert in his own experience and I needed to listen to that and learn from it, and I might have a bit more experience about, a bit more knowledge or experience about theory and talking with people... (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:54:00
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and that's what I could bring. But each of us bringing our strengths to the process it seemed to me to be with that respect. 

00:54:10
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE I think for me it was not knowing At, Atsushi until a couple of minutes before the interview. I think it took a, a little bit of time for us to feel that sense of togetherness, of connection and I think that it began to happen as ah, we started kind of having more no, like I could see he was nodding as I was nodding. I could see that ah, we were responding to, to, to questions, I could, began to sense that. So it happened ah, that together, the sense of connection happened ah, gradually until the end in which I could basically uhm, share with him some of my, how I was experiencing things and I could, I could see that he was beginning to respond. Also, as he was seeing basically(ph) ah, and encouraging he, him ah, again to disagree or not was my own perspectives at that particular point. I think ah, that was uhm, important to accomplish during the first uhm, uhm, minutes. We kinda create that alliance ah, or that sense of connection, togetherness, that would allow him, uhm, to agree or disagree with me. I thought it was important to, to bring up the fact that I'm from a different country because often that's something that happens ah, automatically. People wonder, "Oh, where is he from?" Or, you know, they see an accent, they hear an accent and the(ph) one, and so I wanted to share that with him and I wanted ah, also to put a context- 

00:55:45
Therapeutic relationships are influenced by cultural contexts and it is essential to explore their influence 

00:55:45
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE - to my own ideas and suggestions so ah, we could see how our own thoughts were also coming from specific cultural context. 

00:55:55
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO  And I think that really helped me in a, uhm, in a way, I think I was able to voice my concern uhm, without thinking that I'm gonna be challenged ah, particularly knowing that he was from another country as well uhm, because it is not easy for me often times to share what my concern is. So I felt the sense that, "Okay, maybe he might understand that. Uhm, he might understand what it means for me to talk about my personal relationship or concerns." 

00:56:45
CHARITY TABOL It seems like it created a bridge that you could ah, join in that experience to each other. Since uhm, since we used the word "context," another commonality that uhm, stuck out to me uhm, from witnessing both sessions was the attention to the various context in which Atsushi operates ah, in his daily life, both ah, both family, workplace, other relationships uhm, and I wondered uhm, what about uh, each approach or what, how context is treated ah, within each approach, and how this might be different from uhm, other, perhaps, mainstream uhm, psychotherapy approaches? 

00:57:30
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  Here we are in this specific context and ah, we actually share a context... (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
ATSUSHI MATSUMUTO Hmm. 

00:57:40
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE ...uhm, that we, we're all part of the interview with, with Mary. We all, ah, I was there, so my first act was to acknowledge that context as a way to kinda cre, also kinda create that bridge. And throughout the session, I attempted to bring the other ah, context as a way to see how behaviors and meanings can have ah, ah, different understandings and different context. That's why I brought up Japan. That's why I, why I brought the, the work environment. I wo, ah, that's why we brought up, brought up the family ah, so I wanted to kind of bring all those different context as a way to see how it has an effect. It's not uhm,- 

00:58:25
Contextualizing causes of emotional distress 

00:58:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE - you suffering from all these issues. It's all these contexts also influencing what's- 

00:58:35
Refer to Slide 14 for more detail 

00:58:35
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE - happening in you. They are overworking you over there and they're, they're not really paying attention to a lot of the demands, that's one, one possibility. And ah, I think it's important ah, to kind of noticed that and one of my kind of concerns about this today is what, what wasn't said that this is not only about your job. It's not only about the specific institution you work with. It's about our society in general. We are, we are always asked ah, to do more, to compete, to create and often our own feelings, our own relationships are not taken into account, but that's something I wish I could have addressed more ah, with you during that time. 

00:59:20
DR. MARY BALLOU And to just hop right unto that and tailgate a bit, uhm, the ah, Feminist Therapy has ah, yet another principle. It talks about the personal as political and the political is personal. And so, uhm, various pressures or power structures or in this case, demands- 

00:59:35
Recognizing imperative of social change 

00:59:35
DR. MARY BALLOU - uhm, and expectations of those various- 

00:59:45
Refer to Slide 15 for more detail 

00:59:45
DR. MARY BALLOU - environments or contexts uhm, really do have a large impact and effect on the individual that are often times it's not how the individual can cope with that but it is what the context brings to the individual that ends up being stressful or damaging, and notably the individual has to cope with it in some ways but ah, the other part of that is what change can be done at the work site, in the family, uhm, and changes in those context too, ah, make it them ah, more ah, healthy ah, situations for people. Uhm, so, it's both, it's both end, the personal and the structural, the personal and the political... (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
 Uh-huh. 

01:00:30
DR. MARY BALLOU  uhm, it's sort of a reciprocity ah, in between them. 

01:00:35
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE I think that's a very important similarity between, uhm, cultural psychotherapy and feminism in a way cultural psycho, psychotherapy emerged because a lot of ah, cultural minorities were being oppressed and the voices weren't being heard as in feminism. Ah, the voices of, of many women weren't being heard and being constructive of male, or weren't being constructed appropriately by the dominant theory. And we share that in common that we are (coughs) a response to that oppression and, and I think that what's happening in more in cultural psychotherapy is, that's not only about ethnic minorities. It's not only about cultural diverse groups. It's about everybody in general. 

01:01:20
DR. MARY BALLOU And, and, the same again is true with feminism. I ah, you know, we, we had today a male client uhm, and we did Feminist Therapy, and gender was not a central issue at all but ah, power and expectations ah, were, were very much part of that ah, engaging with the person's that experience and validating that was very much a part of that. Uhm, and, and that's so important to do uhm, in general and especially, if one uhm, lives in a non-dominant position because that's not validated. Uhm, so, feminism has learned a great deal, I think from cultural psychotherapy about, uhm, about ethnicity and race and ah, class, and we continue to learn. Uhm, one of the, one of the things that I learned at today's session was just how uhm, cultural expectations around communication especially, individual personal communication and sharing of those experiences are really vastly different, and for Atsushi in this situation uhm, to talk about how he was healing and his family, uhm, was a real challenge because it's not within the cultural norms. And that came from your interaction with him, you know. So, this feminist therapist learned that listening to a cultural therapist. 

01:02:55
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE On the other hand, what I have learned more from feminism is the emphasis in the relationship, ah, then that sense of togetherness and connectedness, and the, the power imbalances. I think that I, I, I try to be very sensitive to that, and not only constru, construing power as male or female but also including uhm, other categories such as ethnicity, ah, gender orientation ah, religion. All these different categories, I think, are essential to address when we talk about power differ, difference, ah, differentials. 

01:03:35
DR. MARY BALLOU Yup, indeed. 

01:03:35
CHARITY TABOL  So, there seems to be a, a sensitivity in both approaches to reason which how differentials in hierarchies can get replicated uhm, in, in the therapy realm and attention to how uhm, those differentials can be levelled. And ah, you both mentioned uhm, treating the individual ah, and, and attending to their experience but also being aware of structural external factors and forces and of course, uhm, not all of the, sort of, central aspects of either approach could possibly have come out in just a single session an, an abbreviated session at that, but I'm wondering about ah, targeting the external forces as well and, and whether there is a place in either approach for uhm, change beyond the individual or were, or targeting uhm, those social sources of uhm, of oppression or pressure. 

01:04:35
DR. MARY BALLOU  You know that's a, it's a fascinating question because, uhm, you know, one of the things have been, ah, central to feminist therapy is, is feminist ethics and, uhm, and there is enough goal code that feminist therapists have developed and it's it's, it's, aspirational and I think a very important one. But one of the principles in that is social change and I think that's at the forefront of the development of feminist therapy at the current time ah, is social change and activism. And what does that mean, uhm, in the context of psychotherapy or for psychotherapist to be talking about social change... (crosstalk) 

01:05:20
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

01:05:20
DR. MARY BALLOU ...and activism. Ah, and, what does that mean about safeguarding a client? And is the client involved in that or not? Or uhm, is this something that someone does outside of therapy? And these were some, these have been some of the discussions that have gone on as ah, as that thinking has began to develop and uhm, ultimately the answers uhm, aren't really known but some of the structures of that question or that, you know, that each person has to decide it for themselves. (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
CHARITY TABOL Hmm. 

01:05:55
DR. MARY BALLOU And that there are a variety of ways to do that ah, kind of pluralistic stands with regard to that. But that only attending to the damage done to individuals, (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
DR. MARY BALLOU ...sort of disempowerment and harm done to individuals is not enough... (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
CHARITY TABOL Uh hmm. 

01:06:10
DR. MARY BALLOU ...that, that more general social action needs to be taken, maybe the challenge individualistic psychotherapy is maybe to, uhm, create alternatives to mainstreams, maybe to make training tapes like this, so, other people began to think a bit. 

01:06:25
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE  I couldn't agree more and the way it could have happened in this session ah, would have been as we're talking more and more about ah, the situations that are, that At, Atsushi's experience in his job, he would have become increasingly more aware that this is not ah, only about him. It's ah, also about ah, something that's happening ah, in his uhm, research community at this point. And as that happens, as he starts talking, ah, expressing maybe, ah, more ah, possibi, more possibilities would emerge that would allow ah, him, his group ah, to do something about it or to take some actions to transform ah, his particular situation of this ah, at this time, but I do completely agree with what, what Mary is saying, that individual change is not enough. So, I think it's important to look for social change ah, as many of the problems that we experience are result of discrimination, oppression, socioeconomic ah, difficulties, etc. 

01:07:45
DR. MARY BALLOU  Since we are agreeing with that. Let's try one more level of that same, the sa, that same question, uhm, whi, which is I think that the, that the socio, social and political, and economic, uhm, climate of the times is a very difficult one as well that has sped up work and the demands of work and the pressures that individuals feel, and that groups feel and that needs for funding and ah, needs to produce more research and, and that the uhm, that the climate of the times is one ah, that has become a bit more conservative, very much more money-oriented, ah, more materialistic. Uhm, and that, that has, well, it's a little more difficult to talk about especially as we think directly about ah, Atsushi's experience. It's no less important to consider that if we were having this kind of ah, conversation 20 years ago, ah, the pressures with, at, at work would have been very different indeed at that, that time. And the external uhm, structures of the environment are really very important as well. 

01:09:05
CHARITY TABOL One other thing I just wanted to ask uhm, is ah, for many perhaps students watching, ah, this tape were ah, perhaps our audience that we don't know exactly their situations, but beginning therapists or beginning psychologists, uhm, it's a, it, as, as you were both speaking to it's so, it's a different climate ah, politically and it's also a different climate uhm, in, in the mental health world. Uhm, do you have any, I don't wanna say advice, but ah, sort of thoughts for, for new psychologists, new therapists, ah, graduate students on uhm, learning more about these approaches and implementing these approaches, and ah, in environments or settings that they may be working in where this is not the dominant ah, framework or perhaps it's something different or new to even their supervisors or uhm, or their their faculty members. Uhm, I wonder if you have any thoughts about, about that? 

01:10:10
DR. MARTIN LAROCHE It's a very important and good question. And as she was saying that, I was noticing that even as we speak, we're making a lot of assumptions about about what's going on, about what's ah, what's important, what's relevant, and we, Mary and I can agree in a lot of these issues. But I think it's important also to question what we're thinking, always to, kind of look for more. And, ah, try to, ah, to listen to, to our clients as clearly as we can. As, you know, as I was listening to ah, Atsushi, I had a lot of ideas of what might be going on. But again, ultimately is not my decision, it's yours. You are the one who makes these, ah, ah, decisions. And I, it's my job to kind of learn with you, ah, in this process, and to keep questioning and growing in an effective way for you to accomplish what you wanna do. 

01:11:15
DR. MARY BALLOU  I think that at the moment, ah, mental health and, and more generally the health care system uhm, is being ah, controlled by economic forces, and also by uhm, a mind frame that is perhaps more fitting to the corporate world, uhm, and that, that makes doing, uhm, feminist therapy or cultural therapy in the clinics, uhm, ah, in, in, in the hospitals incredibly difficult because it, it, it contests many steps of what we know as mental health treatment ah,(ph) today. Ah, we, for example didn't do the standard intake. We didn't ask all the kind of information that would be in the standard intake protocol in a clinic with Atsushi. We listened to his story, and if there was an additional information we would need as we moved forward we would ask him. We didn't do a different, a differential diagnosis. We didn't kind of asked a series of questions to find out whether this is a reactive depression which we can't use anymore 'coz it's not a DSM-IV so we have to say, well, 311, that's an a typical depression, you know. We didn't ask whether this is an acute stress, we didn't ask whether this is some post-traumatic stress going on, asking enough questions to make those sorts of differential diagnosis. Uhm, or some sort of mixed feature with an AXIS I and II. Ah, we didn't do those things because we were listening to his experience in trying to understand ah, what was going on, and where to go. So, that would be one example of some of the differences. If we were working in a clinic and came out of here, or we had a, ah, we had a mainstream supervisor, or we were having to submit this for billing yesterday, we would need that diagnosis. We would need the appropriate paperwork. And so, I think those sorts of contradictions between ah, relational work and, and broader perspectives and validating client's experiences on the one hand, and the kind of control of mental health practices through uhm, the powers that be today is it, it's a very strong example of some of the conflicts ah, here. 

01:13:50
CHARITY TABOL There are pieces of each, uhm, that perhaps could get integrated into someone's work in a, in a traditional setting such as, uhm, attention to the relational aspects, attention to the power dynamics in the room, uhm, letting the client lead, uhm, things of that nature even... (crosstalk) 

01:14:10
DR. MARY BALLOU Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
