Generative Trance and

Transformation

Stephen Gillgan, PhD 

00:00:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN My name is Steve Gillgan. I like to introduce Linda, who we just met about 10 minutes ago. And she volunteered to do the session today. So the session, the title is Generative Trance and Transformation. I think I just wanna speak two or three minutes to this notion of generative trance and then we'll hopefully experience it in action. The word generative means to be able to go beyond where you've been in your life before, to be able to do something transformational, to be able to do something that's healing, or just to create a new space in your life. And I think it's important to emphasize that about trance because not all the trances are created equal. Some trances can be really nasty trances. I would consider all of the symptoms that we encounter as forms of negative trance. Some trances can be just sort of low-level like television trances or spacing out trances. So therapeutically, we're interested in those trances that really allow something new to happen. So hopefully it'll be something that together that we can open up here. And one other thing I just want to say is that in terms of doing the work as a sort of the practical guidelines that are perhaps unique to the work, we call the three minds and the three levels of each mind. And you might be tracking that. Maybe it's too late in the afternoon to track anything for you at this point, but we really talk about these three different minds which is the mind of the body, the mind in the head, and the mind in the feel for any recovering Catholics, you get this out of it in terms of, in the name of the cognitive and the somatic and the holy field. it looks that resonates. And then what we're really interested is really connecting equally and meaningfully with each of those different aspects of our consciousness and seeing how we can let it go down into what we call the primitive and then move through the ego up to what I call the generative. And the generative is a place where there is no conscious control, but there's something a little bit more interesting than conscious control, which is creative flow. So may we find that in our connection. So with that as a introduction I'd like to welcome you Linda. 

00:03:50
LINDA  Thank you. Can I turn a little more towards you? 

00:03:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN You want come, sure. 

00:03:55
LINDA I just want to -- thank you. 

00:03:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Developed a drinking problem pretty easily, spilling that. Welcome, and you -- I wanted to just emphasize that only partly humorously that I brought my transportable office. I always bring it with me, gets through customs in any country that I go through. I like to make use of it. And the transportable office really has a beautiful capacity to be able to adapt to just really create a good space where each of us can be able to rest in. For me that means usually I forget about everything else except this presence between us. And I don't know exactly what it might mean for you. But I just want to offer the use of the transportable office free of charge. 

00:05:05
LINDA Thank you. 

00:05:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN  And maybe you could just speak just straightforwardly to any hard hearts what would you -- where would you, what would you most want to be in this world? 

00:05:25
LINDA In this work? 

00:05:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN World. World. 

00:05:25
LINDA  World. 

00:05:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN World, in this life. So what I'd most want in my life is and you could even use the phrase and see what comes forward. 

00:05:40
LINDA What first comes to me is to move beyond the trance of my past. 

00:05:50
STEPHEN GILLGAN Say it, sorry, say that again? 

00:05:50
LINDA Move beyond the trance of my past, meaning the story that I've told myself since I believe I was in the womb that I've lived. 

00:06:10
STEPHEN GILLGAN So this makes me so very curious about the space in front of you and the sort of open space. And I become very curious about some other of the things that you think that you might like to see there or feel there or be there or experience there, as all that energy from the past and -- you know, we're talking just one lifetime or? 

00:06:40
LINDA Oh, I am sure there is more than one. 

00:06:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN Is this before reading this beautiful book about 15 billion years of the Universe. So I've been sort of meditating on the 15 billion years following through each of us. If we probably got 15 billion years to go, probably not the planet, but so in terms of the 15 billion years to go, what do you sense, a longing or curiosity for? 

00:07:10
LINDA Well, that's interesting that you said what you did because I've got may wonderful healers or several that have told me this is my last time I have to pay for my karma. 

00:07:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN Last time you have to pay for it. 

00:07:25
LINDA My karma. That's interesting. But in answer to your question, openness, spaciousness... 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:45
LINDA freedom, holistically spaciously, being in that space than I know is there. But this lifetime has been really difficult to get to. 

00:08:00
STEPHEN GILLGAN You mentioned you've been doing at work in somatic experiencing, kind of been dealing with that. 

00:08:05
LINDA  Yes. 

00:08:10
STEPHEN GILLGAN Do you think it would be an interesting and helpful thing to use this session to see what comes forward? 

00:08:15
LINDA  Absolutely. That's why I am here. 

00:08:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN In your possibilities? Great, great. And what I am going to be asking is for your creative unconscious to be guiding us in terms of really how to be able to create that? And so I really would like to welcome and say hi to your creative unconscious. And really ask that presence in you to be guiding the both of us in terms of your journey here today. And when I say that what do you notice? 

00:09:20
LINDA  A flowing from through my body. 

00:09:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN Something is beginning to flow. 

00:09:35
LINDA And I feel a sense of safety with you in the office. 

00:09:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN That's a nice transportable office isn't it? 

00:09:45
LINDA Yes. I really like it. 

00:09:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. So I'm just curious before we begin the next step, and I'd like to do is sort of work in some small chunks how Peter Levine really emphasizes the small chunks. 

00:10:00
LINDA Yes. 

00:10:00
STEPHEN GILLGAN I think it's really good in working with all parts of the creative self to start with the small chunks and to let that flow, really move into deeper waves of open. So as you feel that flowing, I'm still so curious about what images, what symbols in terms of begin to appear in your future that represents the sense of you're in the new part of your life now. You're in the new park already and then really just ask your unconscious mind to be able to send forward any colors, any images, any feelings that begin to guide the two of us in your journey here today. And then take a breath and come on back out where you're ready. That's good. And open your eyes and come on back out. You don't want too far too fast, make sure we get all of our ducks in a row. 

00:11:35
LINDA Thank you. 

00:11:35
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. So tell me what happened there? 

00:11:40
LINDA  It was like seeing this beautiful clouds and white golden light and a sense of peace moving through my body, this calmness, feel the flowing coming through my feet. And it feels like a flow. 

00:12:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN Thank you. Want to know what I experienced? 

00:12:15
LINDA  Yes, I would. 

00:12:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN As I was listening to those suggestions I saw a ring of fire. 

00:12:25
LINDA A ring of fire. 

00:12:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN And then I heard Johnny Cash's voice. I was just so curious about in our translucent transportable space if there was room for a lot of different possibilities. 

00:12:45
LINDA Absolutely. 

00:12:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN Air fire, and we haven't got any water yet or earth, but I am sure it's just a matter of time. 

00:13:00
LINDA And as you said bringing fire, that's been something that sense of energy has been a difficult place for me. 

00:13:10
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. Is it me or is it your hair that's getting redder and redder. 

00:13:20
LINDA I think it needs to. 

00:13:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN I've been meditating with this idea of meditating with your hair and fire, you ever tried that? 

00:13:30
LINDA I like that. 

00:13:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. 

00:13:30
LINDA I am going to borrow that. 

00:13:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. It's nice. It's nice. 

00:13:35
LINDA I can feel that. 

00:13:35
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. So all of the different elements join us. And in order to begin to tune to this long-awaited future and like to do the next piece and I am going to invite us both to do it together, which is to really just spend a time on what are the three connections that I think will give us a good positive constrain for to really just trust the journey. And the first is entering, second is sensing where the positive intention is, and then the third is inviting resources... 

00:14:35
LINDA Yes. 

00:14:35
STEPHEN GILLGAN into the field. So I am going to do this along with you. You can do with your eyes open or closed. So as we begin to orient to this sense of future, may we both take a few moments as to begin to sense the connections that are needed, as we let go off the ego mind and all the intellect and all the reasons and all of beliefs. It's really nice to know there is a place inside that you can be able to begin to sense and tune to a place of well begin, a place of deep interconnection, and maybe you've experienced it before. Just to sense deep in your body, place that has no weight, no time, no muscles, at a very, very beautiful presence. So may we both begin to find our center. Find a place inside connected to wisdom connected to possibility, connected to an enfolded future. 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN You can even sense on the scale of one to 10 how much you feel that connection, where is it, your heart, belly, solar plexus, your hips relaxing, shoulders relaxing, you spine opening. That's a beautiful thing to feel such a delicate subtle grounding pleasurable connection to a mind before the mind and to see on the scale one to 10 how much you first find yourself there and then curious small little shifts, the breath, the image, the color, allows that center to become just a little bit more resonant now and just a little bit or present through which so many, many different experiential possibilities can begin to flow. That's good. That's good. And as you feel your breathing changing, space around you opening. And again return to that sense of your simple intention which really want in your hard hearts, don't have to even believe it. You don't have to know how. That's really a nice thing, isn't it? 

00:18:40
LINDA Yes. 

00:18:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN To discover something that's already there. You can feel on that scale of one to 10 just how much so far, feel connection to the center. That's good. That's really great. And as you breath, we can both tune in little bit more something easily finally beginning to release into the world. That's good. Not too much, too fast because as you feel that connection to your center and as you feel that connection whatever way, whether it feels close or distant, a visual or like somatic or both at the same time or it can begin to invite your unconscious mind to allow the third connection, which is just to allow the space all around to begin to relax. And just allow a sense or whatever resources, what other presences, whatever beings past, present, can support you on this journey, could be historical presences, could be somebody that you haven't attuned to for a long time that believes in you, that loves you. Very nice just the sense, the different resources that let you know you're not alone on that journey, that your life is supported by so many different presences. Before you think or act or it's always nice to sense your center, the place of wisdom, to sense simply what you do want and to be curious about different resources. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN And take just a few moments to feel those three connections and the connection among the connections, the center... 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN Intention. And then as you take a breath, just let yourself open your eyes and come on back out so we can chat about that just a little bit. 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:05
LINDA Oops, sorry. 

00:23:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN Hi, what was that like? 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:20
LINDA Bottom line process, just it kind of replicated when you asked me to come back. It said I don't want to come back. Does that make sense? 

00:23:35
STEPHEN GILLGAN That's the story of the past. Of course. You know the best thing that I learned from Milton Erickson immediately because I learned trance as a child as most of us who are good at trance, I used it as a way of leaving this world. 

00:23:55
LINDA You mean to? 

00:23:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN No. I grew up in Irish Catholic alcoholic family. 

00:24:00
LINDA I grew up in an alcoholic family, but we weren't Irish or Catholic. 

00:24:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah, yeah. And so I was -- really trance was my first home. I was really comfortable in it. And when I met Erickson, two things happened immediately, I was 19, which was the first, this is the first guy -- I didn't know much about anything else but I knew a lot about trance. He was the first guy that who was so far beyond me in trance. It was like the close encounters of the third kind where they play that music... 

00:24:40
LINDA Yeah. 

00:24:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN To the base ship and the response comes back. 

00:24:45
LINDA Going home. 

00:24:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN And I was amazing, like wow, here is somebody, a teacher. But even more amazing it was something that I had never imagined before which was, he wasn't using trance to leave the world, he was using trance to enter the world. And it never dawned on me. I have been so grateful for sort of opening that space that you can use your connection to your unconscious to enter the world. Of course as a child when you say enter the world usually means you gotta go through other people, right. You gotta go through your family, you gotta go through your teachers. So to enter the world means you gotta encounter other people, right. 

00:25:45
LINDA And then come back into your body. 

00:25:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Right. Well, one of the nice things about becoming to be a grownup I think maybe it's relevant years when you -- to come into the world you don't need anybody's permission and you don't need to connect with anybody, but just the world. 

00:26:15
LINDA I am just beginning to learn that. 

00:26:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN  You're just beginning to learn that? 

00:26:20
LINDA Hmm. 

00:26:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN So beyond all the assholes and idiots technically speaking there is a lot of really wonderful stuff. 

00:26:30
LINDA Yes. 

00:26:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN Seems like you're learning that too. 

00:26:35
LINDA I've always seen the beauty. 

00:26:35
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. So what I hope we can do in terms of this entering into the world without giving your soul or your center away to anybody else. 

00:26:55
LINDA Yes. 

00:26:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN  That we can do maybe a next part of the journey about what that would be like. 

00:27:05
LINDA Without chaos. 

00:27:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Hmmm? 

00:27:10
LINDA Without chaos. I feel the chaos in my body when I come back. 

00:27:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN That ring of fire keeps coming back would you saw that? 

00:27:20
LINDA Well, after you brought that up, I felt it to my whole body. 

00:27:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN Actually it's very comforting to me to see that when you say about chaos to see that ring of fire has got a beautiful center to it. Have you ever gone through a ring of fire? 

00:27:40
LINDA Just in my body. 

00:27:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN Hmm, yeah. Okay, so let's just tune to this idea again, and this time I'm going to ask you to keep it for yourself and don't give it away quite yet, maybe not for sometime. But when you close your eyes just for a minute or so, just see what appears in this next opening okay. You wanna know what I really fucking want, here it is. 

00:28:15
LINDA  Would you please repeat what you said? 

00:28:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN I said you wanna know what I really fucking want in my life. Here it is. So if you were to say those words to yourself. You want to know what I really fucking want in my life, here it is. 

00:28:35
LINDA  And just sit with that? 

00:28:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN What? 

00:28:40
LINDA And just sit with that. 

00:28:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Just to know, just to know it. 

00:28:45
LINDA Okay. 

00:28:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN So go ahead and then I am going to do the next piece of generative trance work. You want to know what I really fucking want. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN There it is. That's good. That's good, Linda. That's good to know it. It's good to feel that fire in your heart. That's good to know it's there. That's good. So then come on back out when you're ready. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:45
STEVE GILLGAN That's good, ha? 

00:29:45
LINDA Hmmm. 

00:29:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. I feel a deeper level of kinship with you, whatever that place that you touch. 

00:30:00
LINDA Thank you. 

00:30:00
STEPHEN GILLGAN  So, I want to turn to this question of what you need in terms of your state turning which is kind of what we’re doing with the term hypnotic induction about what's your optimal state for being able to bring that into the world. And I'd like to just sort of ask you a few questions about that, okay? 

00:30:35
LINDA Yes. 

00:30:35
STEPHEN GILLGAN  You think of your sort of a good trance like a soup and the soup has got a lot of different ingredients and one of the ingredients would be focus and absorption and a focus on what it is that you're wanting to go to. Does that make sense? 

00:31:00
LINDA I'm a little in that trance I mean, I'm little not here and... 

00:31:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN Right. So to get to where you want to go... 

00:31:10
LINDA Yes. Focus. 

00:31:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN Focus. You need focus right. 

00:31:20
LINDA Absolutely. 

00:31:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN Good. So I'm going to introduce I was alluding to the scale of one to 10 where one is the low end and 10 is the higher. And I'm going to ask you to use it as a way of just noticing where you are in this dimension and maybe a couple of others and to see how you can be able to optimize that level so that you can be able to do what you wanna do in the world. So on the scale of one to 10 tuning to your level of focus. 

00:32:00
LINDA Yes. 

00:32:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN I'm gonna ask your inner self to let a number come forward that represents how much focus that you feel right now? So let's just the number come. 

00:32:15
LINDA Between eight and nine. 

00:32:20
STEVE GILLGAN Hmmm? 

00:32:20
LINDA Between eight and nine. 

00:32:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN It's good, it's good. Now here we to -- to be able to increase it just a little bit more, can’t go much more on the scale of 10, maybe half a point. Do you think that would be interesting? 

00:32:40
LINDA Yes. 

00:32:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN If you could discover how your body and your mind can increase your fierceness and can increase your focus? 

00:32:45
LINDA  Yes. 

00:32:50
STEPHEN GILLGAN Good. So when you're ready, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes again and I'm just going to ask your creative unconscious to bring forward any images, any memories, any feelings that help you become just a little bit more focused, just a little bit more fierce. 

00:33:20
LINDA This is a place I'm familiar with, my body is trying to pull me out. 

00:33:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN It's what? 

00:33:30
LINDA Trying to pull me out. If I have -- when I have my focus if I -- right now my body is -- a part of my body is going into the chaos warning me it's like it’s internal. 

00:33:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN  I'm sure that makes sense. 

00:33:55
LINDA Does it make sense? 

00:33:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN I'm sure it makes sense. So let your eyes open again and isn't nice that we brought the transportable office? 

00:34:05
LINDA Yes. And thank you for providing such a safe place. 

00:34:10
STEPHEN GILLGAN That you can be able to really make a nice place? 

00:34:15
LINDA Yes. 

00:34:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN  I’m sure that chaos -- I'd like to say to that chaos, welcome. 

00:34:20
LINDA  Maybe the chaos is that ring of fire? 

00:34:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Fire? 

00:34:30
LINDA That ring of fire. 

00:34:30
STEVE GILLGAN Fire, chaos and fire? 

00:34:35
LINDA Yes. 

00:34:35
STEPHEN GILLGAN And this is usually where you had to go away. 

00:34:40
LINDA Always. 

00:34:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN Well, welcome to the future. See this transportable office, it has so many different interesting dimensions. I keep discovering more every time that I step into it. 

00:35:00
LINDA  And it's changing. 

00:35:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN It’s changing. 

00:35:05
LINDA Hmmm. 

00:35:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN So to be able to enjoy all the way that that chaos begins to shift in shape and trance and forth... 

00:35:20
LINDA Yeah. 

00:35:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN I’m gonna ask to bring a second dimension into the soup. A good trance soup has not only good fierceness, but as your mother probably told you, a good trance soup also has a good relaxation as an ingredient. Did she tell you that? 

00:35:40
LINDA Never. 

00:35:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN  No? 

00:35:45
LINDA My mother was a rageaholic. 

00:35:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN Well, let me be the first, Linda, a good trance soup as I could develop a relaxation. And so just tuning to that I'm gonna ask you to just notice how much relaxation you feel in this place with the future and the past and a whirlwind, and chaos, and a ring of fire, and heavens and the transportable space. How much relaxation do you feel? 

00:36:25
LINDA I have this incredible feeling, you said three place like my legs and my lower legs and my feet are totally peaceful and the flow is peaceful. The ring of fire is around my heart, space, and my arms, but it's changing as you told me. 

00:36:50
STEPHEN GILLGAN So just the facts ma'am, what's the number? 

00:36:55
LINDA The number? 

00:36:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN The number? We've got our right hemisphere and we've got our left hemisphere. 

00:37:00
LINDA Thank you for bringing me back. So again the question. 

00:37:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN  I hope you're just okay to go on. You see sometimes when people to go into trance, they begin to go space. So we really want to get... 

00:37:15
LINDA  To know me. 

00:37:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN I know, yeah. I'm a trained professional. So what number comes with relaxation? 

00:37:30
LINDA Six. 

00:37:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Okay. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN Okay. Is it okay to discover how you can let a little bit more relaxation? 

00:37:55
LINDA Yes. 

00:37:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN And really, I really want to invite your creative unconscious? That it really has been waiting in the wings for a long time it feels like. 

00:38:10
LINDA  Yes. 

00:38:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN To begin to bring forth through your body and through your mind, through our connection to bring forth that which allows you now as a woman, as a woman who has entered her face as a healer, to bring forth relaxation. So you can begin to sense. That's good. You can use trance to come into the world, into the world, with her heart of fire and a body of relaxation. Most important, something beginning to flow forward through you that begins to open a space for relaxed, intense movement in the world. And when you're ready please close your eyes and don't go too far away, just enough to see the bare bones, the simple reality of the first steps of this is my god damn life. Just notice it. You can feel rather detached. Your job is to just remember your body is capable for relaxation. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
STEVE GILLGAN You're being this capable for fierceness. Your life moves forward one damn step at a time. 

00:41:05
[sil.] 

00:41:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN It's nice to use trance to burn a beautiful opening through time. So that all of the delicate parts of your being can walk behind you, inside of you, and the beautiful path of fire and say where did this presence come from. Is she from your future or did you just grow into her? 

00:42:00
[sil.] 

00:42:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN And then just note what's there that’s worth remembering, building on, appreciating as entries into the dream world tonight, appreciating as understandings for the little openings that burst into flame today, tomorrow, next week, at your own damn time. 

00:42:50
[sil.] 

00:42:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN Your unconscious can make a long distance call, but it surely has a different ringtone than that. So come on back. 

00:43:10
[sil.] 

00:43:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN Hi. 

00:43:15
LINDA Hi. 

00:43:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN What happened there? 

00:43:15
LINDA  I feel like a warrior. 

00:43:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN A warrior. 

00:43:25
LINDA Alive. I don't feel the separation I used to feel. I almost wanna say shut that damn phone off. 

00:43:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN Shut the damn phone off. What did you want to say? 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:50
LINDA Oops. 

00:43:50
STEPHEN GILLGAN What? What was that? Did you say oops or fuck yes? I'm only gonna tell ya once! 

00:44:00
LINDA  I like yours better. 

00:44:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN Hmmm? 

00:44:05
LINDA I like what you said better. 

00:44:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN  I do too. 

00:44:15
[sil.] 

00:44:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN Have you given birth before? 

00:44:20
LINDA  To a baby or myself? 

00:44:30
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. 

00:44:30
LINDA  Both? Yes. But not like this. 

00:44:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN  I think you know I'm really serious in the deepest sense. 

00:44:55
[sil.] 

00:45:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN That's a beautiful space that just opened, ha? 

00:45:25
LINDA Incredible. 

00:45:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Yeah. Maybe it's a good time to close the eyes again and just be able to very gently use that beautiful delicacy to sense that, to touch that, to breath that, to absorb that as your base. I don't know how long that you've known, that you had this presence of a healer inside. How long, if known, you need to find that warrior to clear the space? Was that beautiful delicate, healing presence, that's come into this world to do already beautiful journey. And so I really want to welcome that warrior that's deep within you, through your heart of fire, through your hair on fire, through your whole body on fire, much different kind of chaos, isn't it? 

00:47:15
LINDA Totally. 

00:47:15
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Yeah. 

00:47:20
LINDA It's contained, yet vibrating, it's annoying, coming home. 

00:47:35
[sil.] 

00:47:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN Thank you for sharing that with me. And I just like to ask you from that place to allow that warrior whatever she carries, whether it's a sword or fire or just that fierce look in your eyes, let her begin to walk forward and you follow her. That's good to know that there are two such beautiful different presences that live within your soul. Something so delicate and sweet, so connected, something that should know as human and good and beautiful, a fierce heat of living, falling towards the center of your longing. 

00:49:00
[sil.] 

00:49:05
STEPHEN GILLGAN And it's nice to know she can be in front, you can watch her for a while, not even show her whether you see it with your own eyes, but that's in you, but that's you, that's her, that’s you, a separate, same, different. 

00:49:35
[sil.] 

00:49:40
STEPHEN GILLGAN And each time that you go back into a trance in a coming days, you can really ask all of the chaos that you encounter to swirl colas(ph), spiral, dance, churn, move into fire, that burns through the ringing cell phones, the assholes, and the idiots, the people that would dare to stop you. That's good. And following beyond behind her, beautiful little girls with flower baskets announcing that the princess in white princess is returning. Now that she has all that beautiful guard of honor, beautiful white. And of course every image from me, your creative unconscious translates into your own experiential awareness. Your spirit finally making up for lost time. You did not come into this world to be afraid. You came into this world to let that ball of fire every which way, fuck yes. 

00:51:50
LINDA  Fuck yes. 

00:51:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN Fuck yes. 

00:51:55
LINDA Fuck yes. 

00:51:55
STEPHEN GILLGAN  Fuck yes. 

00:52:00
LINDA I'm here. 

00:52:00
STEPHEN GILLGAN  And I know the APA is going to censor me once they see this tape. Why you know, we can say to them, we can give them idiomotoric finger signals. 

00:52:15
LINDA I don’t care. 

00:52:20
[sil.] 

00:52:25
STEPHEN GILLGAN That's good. You did very beautiful work. 

00:52:30
[sil.] 

00:52:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN And we are nurtured and fed by that. Really great. 

00:52:50
LINDA  I hope -- since I was little I used to call myself I was keeper of the flame. 

00:53:00
STEPHEN GILLGAN A keeper of the flame? Wow. 

00:53:00
LINDA  I didn’t know it was the fire. 

00:53:10
STEPHEN GILLGAN Yeah. Good place to end. Really, really wish you the very, very best and... 

00:53:20
LINDA Thank you so much. 

00:53:20
STEPHEN GILLGAN There's a beautiful Rumi line and I’m just gonna paraphrase it where he says, if you're here unfaithfully with us, you’re causing terrible damage. But if you're here faithfully, you're helping people that you don't even know and have never met. Is what I say true, say yes quickly? 

00:53:45
LINDA Yes. 

00:53:45
STEPHEN GILLGAN If you've known it from before at the beginning of time, before I could write. So thank you for being here faithfully, because it goes to the rest of us too. 

00:54:00
LINDA Thank you. 

00:54:00
STEPHEN GILLGAN Namaste. 

00:54:05
[sil.]
