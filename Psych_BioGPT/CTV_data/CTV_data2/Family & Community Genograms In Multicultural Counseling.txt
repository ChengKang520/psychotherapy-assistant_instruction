FAMILY AND COMMUNITY GENOGRAMS IN MULTICULTURAL COUNSELING Psychotherapy as Liberation Allen E. Ivey Patricia Taimanglo Pier Copyright 1996 Allen E. Ivey and Patricia Taimanglo Pier INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS 

00:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Welcome to Psychotherapy as Liberation. Now, what is Psychotherapy as Liberation? The basic message is to see the individual in social context. What do I mean by see the individual in social context? Basically, it means, it isn't just what the individual thinks, feels, or believes. It's also, what is the influence of culture, gender, sexual orientation and other factors on the way the person is, in his or her being in the world, his or her being in the world, psychotherapy in context. The purpose of this tape then is to demonstrate some fairly specific methods of helping clients see themselves in social context. Patricia Pier and I are going to work with you, gonna present an interview, I'm going to be interviewing Patricia first, and then she's gonna be interviewing me. One of the most important aspects of Psychotherapy as Liberation is coconstruction. And we try to work toward eliminating the hierarchy of helper and helpee. In effect, I think I can help Patricia look a little to herself as a person in a social context, and I know that she can help me learn about myself as a social human being. So it's a learning process in which two people are working together. Coming out with this ah, video is also a chapter that I've done on Psychotherapy as Liberation, and there you can see some of the theoretical background coming from developmental counseling and therapy, and Paula Ferrara's(ph) work in Brazil. Now step one in Psychotherapy as Liberation, is the idea of Coconstruction- 

00:02:10
Coconstruction 

00:02:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - an equality between helper and helpee. As part of that, I'm actually going to give Patricia a structure of the interview in her hands and I'll have in my hands, the structure of the interview. You don't always wanna have a written structure of the interview and the specific questions in your hands but, the idea I'm presenting here is symbolically, sharing the power with the client. So the client knows whats happening. I've already reviewed this plan with Patricia, she's reviewed her plans with me. So, in effect, we've done what we can to remove the, the barriers of hierarchy and patriarchy. The second thing that we're gonna be focusing on is- 

00:02:50
Positive cultural aspects 

00:02:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - the positive aspects of culture. And with that, we'll use the Community Genogram and the Family Genogram to, to generate positive images. And the techniques here are drawn from neuro-li-, neuro-linguistic programming, Jane Jenlins(ph) focusing, and of course, my own developmental counseling of psychotherapy. The importance of images representing cultural ah, metaphors, which we can draw on later to empower the client in the process of counseling and therapy. The third dimension, which I've already mentioned, but I wanna stress that as we, I conclude this brief introduction is the idea of self-in-relation or self in context. I've been working in the last several years to move myself away from the concept of self to the concept of, as Jean Baker Miller says so well, self-in-relation. The idea is that I don't really exist as a person unless I have in-relationship with somebody else. That somebody else is my family, my community, my spiritual life, and my culture. In(ph) the underlying techniques and focuses of this tape is to demonstrate how some of these concepts can be added to traditional counseling and psychotherapy. Not in opposition, but added to traditional counseling and psychotherapy to enrich and perhaps move to a more culturally relevant and respectful counseling and psychotherapy. 

00:04:10
Social Justice and the Chamorro People Allen Ivey Interviews Patricia Pier 

00:04:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Patricia, thanks for coming. Ah, how do you feel about being here tonight uh, going on global television? 

00:04:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, I feel excited but I'm also uhm, a little anxious. 

00:04:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I think, I am too. Ah, it's, it's always ah, a little bit tense to do this,- (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:04:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - so were gonna have to work to become a little bit more natural and ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:04:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - we'll do the best we can, and uh, we're gonna start looking at some of your issues and then later on, we'll work on some of mine and,- (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yeah. 

00:04:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - kinda know what's, what's going to happen so. Ah, I, I do have here the questions that we may be exploring. 

00:04:55
Coconstruction: Share interview questions and plan with client 

00:04:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And I've talked to you about them already. So, I think it's important for counselors to think about this idea rather than surprises, to share it with their clients,- (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, what they're going to do and why. 

00:05:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY What are your thoughts about that? 

00:05:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  I think its really uhm, helpful in, in, providing me with a sense of uhm, purpose in knowing that, that this is gonna be okay. So it, it provides a sense of safety- (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, 'coz I know what to expect. Uhm, and I feel that there aren't gonna be any surprises. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:05:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So that's, that's what helpful to me. 

00:05:30
ALLEN E. IVEY In sort of the structure of this, I would like first of all, just to ask about the general issue you'd like to talk about. But we're not gonna go into that in any particular depth in the beginning. We're just going to outline the general issue then we will move to ah, Community Genogram,- (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:05:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - and also then to a Family Genogram of(ph) the(ph) person, cultural and ah, family supports before we go and deal with the issue itself. 

00:05:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

00:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that okay? 

00:05:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And you prepared here, well be pulling them out uh, both the Cultural Genogram and the Family Genogram, right? 

00:05:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

00:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Great. Thanks so much. So, my guess, you're ready to begin? 

00:06:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:06:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Alright(ph). 

00:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Could you tell what you wanted to share today? 

00:06:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I think ah, what I was looking at was uhm, how people don't necessarily uhm, there's a general ignorance about Chamorros,- (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, that I find disturbing particularly since uhm, we have been a part of the United States for some time. Uhm, in that general sense of ignorance, uhm, is, is quite pervasive. (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, so in a way it, it negates our uniqueness as well as, our, our place as people. 

00:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So you feel your people's place has been neglected and denied? 

00:06:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

00:06:45
ALLEN E. IVEY How has it been for you personally? 

00:06:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, at different stages of my development, I think uhm, I've had different emotions and different thoughts about it. 

00:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:06:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - Uhm, but I've also, in a, in a stage where I'm, I'm looking at being proactive and saying, okay, people aren't necessarily uhm, responsible because society is such that, if the members of people aren't high enough, people just don't care. You just somehow are uhm, subsumed into a much larger group. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And in a sense, neglected. 

00:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now one of the things I'm hearing Patricia is that you really are ready to begin to see yourself as a person in cultural context. So you start with the fairly high level of consciousness of yourself as Chamorro and what that means to you, is that correct? 

00:07:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

00:07:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And so, some, not everybody that will go through this process will start with that awareness. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And some of the things we do would help bring people to awareness, but we're going to explore some of those cultural sources and learn a little bit more about your story. 

00:07:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that okay? 

00:07:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER That's okay. 

00:07:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And we'll be getting some more specifics of that as we move along. 

00:07:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yeah. 

00:07:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay. Where I'd like to begin, and I find this immensely helpful for me in understanding ah, the culture is what we called, Community Genogram. And, before we started, I asked you to, to draw one for us and ah, I think the best way to show it, and you got it there is we can kind of hold it up. And we can talk about it, you can tell me through it. And this is, represents your community as a Chamorro. And- (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

00:08:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - could you tell me what, what is here in your story about our Community Genogram. 

00:08:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER As I am today. 

00:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY As you are today. 

00:08:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So I'm looking at, at the, right outside, or the peak the structures or the systems that are most important to me. So there's the, there's the parents and siblings, my husband Ed, and my children- (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - Alison and Aaron. Uhm, then special friends, coming over here, the extended family. Uhm, and that includes my family through Ed. 

00:08:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Ah, social friends, religion and professional relationships. Uhm, and each of those things, each of those systems, uhm, provide a different sense of support or different way of being, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - but I think all of it, represents who I am. In family relations, relationship that's support, family relationships, past and present, intimate relationships- (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
Community Genogram Provides Context 

00:09:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - professional, and so forth. Uhm, then in terms of the extended family and social friends, its cultural, language, traditions, stories- (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, relaxation and religion would be traditions and beliefs. 

00:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. I would like to, as you started out talking about the Chamorro, can we focus a little bit here on the culture, language and traditions, which tell me a little bit about ah, the Chamorro culture and uh, how this affected you growing up? 

00:09:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I guess what I think about Chamorro culture, we would be talking about this part of the Genogram or the community gram. (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And uhm, I really think of, of, the extended family uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and what comes to mind is, is, images of, of being, spending time at my uncle's ranch. And it wasn't just my brothers and myself, it was my cousins, and then my, my cousins from my, my other aunts and uncles. (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And we would just always get together in, in this image of, of all the children just running up the hills,- (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, picking guavas. 

00:10:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER It was a, a real exciting, a warm, safe- 

00:10:25
Connectedness, family, and culture 

00:10:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - environment, uhm, because we, we didn't have just one parent, we have lots of parents. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  And there is a lot of care going around. Uhm. 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So, this image that you have. I got, I got, kinda got the visual image of, you, the children, running up the hill- (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - to pick guavas. And that's a very, with many feeling, that many parents, many people, many caretakers- (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - is very important to you. Its really important to, to share, I'm not sure the word Chamorro is part of the business of not being seen. Not everybody knows where it is or another name for the people. 

00:11:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Could you, might wanna share a little bit about that in history. 

00:11:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. Chamorros are the people from Guam. 

00:11:05
Chamorro 

00:11:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER They're also, they're people from the Marianas islands. And uh, the largest Marianas island in the Pacific Ocean. And, the largest island on the chain is Guam. And, in the United States most people are, know us by Guamanians. (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But there are other Chamorros. There are people from Saipan and they call themselves Saipanis. Ah, people from Rhoda, or Luta,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and uhm, people from Tanian. And then there are other smaller islands. But we have, uhm, a history, and ah, a language and traditions, and belief systems that ah, continue to bond us- (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, over the years. Although political changes have occurred that have somehow separate us, separated us from the other islands, uhm, we are still very much Chamorro. 

00:12:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. We are very much Chamorro. I heard some strength in you as you said that. 

00:12:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
Images can be used to anchor strengths 

00:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY What are some images that come to your mind as you imagine being a Chamorro? 

00:12:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Images of ah, sitting in with large families. Uhm, the elderly people, the grandparents, the aunts and uncles, ah, there's a high sense of respect for them. (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, warmth around food, sharing, generosity, uhm, caring, supporting one another. Those are the types of ah, characteristics that uhm, come to mind when I think about what it means to be Chamorro. 

00:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So its that extended family that really catches the meaning of being Chamorro for you. 

00:12:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

00:12:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, I think we can put this down. We wouldn't usually hold this, like, this this in an interview. We'll put it over there. Ah, we may, we'll come back to that again, we'd actually posted in back of us or we have it sitting here in the interview. (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY But I think that gives a beginning picture of the Community Genogram. And I, would like to go back to, uh, your view of yourself with your family or extended family and, uh, what central image comes to your mind, in relationship to that extended family that's supportive, that caring, that network of people that you have. 

00:13:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I, I guess its hard for me to think of one image, because there's so many images where there's support and reciprocity, and then general caring. Uhm, the image that comes to mind, readily is, is, the image of a lot of people. And you're not all from the same nuclear family. Uhm, and there's this connection that we have with one another. Uhm, that, that distance doesn't, uhm, separate us. 

00:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER We are still, uh, for example, I had a call form my cousin this morning, uhm, on Guam, and she just wanted to talk, and we talked for about half an hour, uhm. So even though I'm still far away, I still feel very much connected. 

00:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And that, that sense of continually supporting one another, uhm, so it images around, kitchens, eating, talking, people dropping in. 

00:14:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, you don't have to call and say, uhm, are you gonna be home? People just drive by and, and there's always food, and there's always a place for, for family who'd come. 

00:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, slight image of boys(ph) that openness, is, is what I find as being very important. 

00:14:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So that closeness and openness. 

00:14:55
Magnifying the positive image through here and now visualization 

00:14:55
ALLEN E. IVEY One thing we've done before and would like to do that again, if you just take that image of closeness and openness. 

00:15:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Imagine one of those times, and then, just sort of, see it in your minds eye for just a moment. 

00:15:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY What are you seeing? 

00:15:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Just a lot of people hugging, laughing, talking, eating, uhm, there's a lot of touching. They're just images of, of warmth and support. 

00:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. As you get that, those images of warmth and support, people hugging, and so forth, hugging, touching, uh, what feelings, what and where did they, where did they, what could go, flow through, what feelings flow through you. 

00:15:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER There was a sense of safety and warmth. 

00:15:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And, uhm, I'm just- (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - just goes right through me. 

00:15:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay. Can you locate that- 

00:16:00
Anchoring the feelings of the positive image in the body 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - feeling of safety and warmth in your body? 

00:16:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER It would be right here. (Client motions arm to specify area upper chest.) 

00:16:00
Our body carries our positive images from the past 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  So that's, Chamorro safety and warmth basically is always with you anytime you want to call on that image. 

00:16:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, to stay with your Community Genogram for just a moment. You also kinda had, on this corner the Chamorro, represented by the extended family, spirituality. Then you have the professional. I'm just wondering if you could tell us a little about that part of your present community and how that's going? 

00:16:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, in, in my, well, I'm here in Massachusetts, my family's in Guam, my husband and my children are in Hawaii, so I feel very much separated in a kinda pulled apart in many directions. But what has helped me here is that, I have, uhm, special friends- (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and mentors, who had really provided me a sense of that community that I miss so much. Uhm, there's, there are friends who share, the same interests. 

00:17:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm, in our, in our work, uhm, and who provides support and a real sense of caring for one another. Uhm, pass much, much further than, uhm, than casual interest. 

00:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So we're very supportive of one another. 

00:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So you've been able to recreate here in your graduate program, some of the aspects? 

00:17:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

00:17:25
ALLEN E. IVEY uh, that you treasured so much from your native Chamorro people. Great. 

00:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER That sounds very nice. I didn?t go to graduate school like that, I?ll tell you. I had all, we'll talk about that a little bit later. So it?s a wonderful, supportive type of, uh, framework you have coming out of the Chamorro background. Uh, I also asked you to do a family genogram. And I just wonder if you might tell me a little bit about how, about your family. There are a lot of people here, where are you by the way? 

00:18:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I'm down here. 

00:18:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I see. 

00:18:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And? 

00:18:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:18:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Both of my parents were married before and their spouses died. And this is my father's first wife's family. There's the children. 

00:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So my oldest sister is Dorothea(ph) and then my, then they, my mother's, uh, first husband also died- (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And when the two married, uhm, they had us. Uh, David was born before we were, uhm, he was, uhm, her first husband's child. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But we're all very close. 

00:18:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, so when you look at this all together, there's 15 of us. 

00:18:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, they're much older than, than we are. And this family right here, is the family that is still in Guam. 

00:18:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  And this family here, although we're the same family but time has, has moved us. Most of them are living out here on what we call the mainland- (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or the states. Uhm, this is my, my husband, Ed, and my children. But when we look going upwards, uhm, my mother also comes from a very large family. Uhm, there are seven of them, I believe. And, uhm, I have a little markers here because, uh, this really signifies the transition. This was Spanish rule. 

00:19:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
Family history represented in the history of Guam 

00:19:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER This was when, uh, Guam was, uhm, a colony- (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - of Spain. And then as a result of this Spanish-American war, uhm, we were, there was a transition from being to a colony of Spain to being a colony of the United States. 

00:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So the, the American influence began in 1898. Uhm, and another marker would be right here was in, uh, 1941, a couple of days after, ah, not a couple of days, the same day actually, just a couple of hours after Pearl Harbor was bombed, uhm, Guam was also bombed- (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and taken, uhm, occupied by the Japanese forces. And it wasn't until 1944 that Guam was in a sense liberated from- (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - the Japanese by the Americans. And then we became, uhm, a territory again of the United States. But it wasn?t until 1950, uhm, that we became US citizens. Before that we really had no status. 

00:20:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - but we were still a territory. So when I?m looking at this, I see, uhm, those, those events as being significant in, in influencing Guam's, the changes on Guam- (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - as well as the people. Uhm, I know, does that help? 

00:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. There's in that framework, there also is the whole concept of what you're talking, we moved from the Spanish to the U.S. rule, uh, matriarchal versus a patriarchal society. 

00:21:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY That was an interesting, important point for you might wanna talk about how it influence you and how that happened in Guam. 

00:21:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Right. 

00:21:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - the Chamorro people. 

00:21:15
Patricia Taimanglo Pier: The Spanish, uh, although they came in and, uhm, we have basically 300 years of Spanish occupational rule, they really didn?t make any extreme efforts to make us Spain -- Spanish. (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, uh--huh. 

00:21:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, and our culture was very matriarchal- 

00:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or matrilineal in its order. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Ah, for example, the, the women were the heads of the family- 

00:21:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
Matriarchal tradition 

00:21:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER They control the money. They have the wealth. The land was passed on through the woman. So, I mean even the, the child's last name was the, the mother's last name. 

00:21:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I see. 

00:21:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - not the father's. So all those examples are, are much different from the way people in United States view that, you know, family, where it's more patriarchal. 

00:22:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:22:10
U.S. imposes Patriarchal tradition 

00:22:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So when Americans came in 1898, uhm, they actually changed all of the, the names of the people to reflect the father's last name. 

00:22:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And interestingly enough, they also passed a law that made man the head of the household- (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - because it was something that wasn't a part of our, uhm, our understanding. So it's a way of making us pay attention to it. And also keep, it wasn't until 1950 where our language was, uhm, forced under. We were, for example my older sisters were punished for, uh, speaking our language in school. And it was often a monetary fine, which was very expensive, uhm, it could feed a family for a day. So those types of, of changes, uhm, were much different from the Spanish rule where they- (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - just basically let us be, we, we, what, that's after 300 years of, of occupation- (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or colonialism. Prior to that, of course, there was much, uhm, fighting going on, uhm, until our population submitted to their presence. 

00:23:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But they allowed us to exist, uhm, in, in way that we were happy. 

00:23:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So in effect, you sort of saying that your family kinda represents the history of Guam. 

00:23:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

00:23:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh, and the Chamorro history, the Chamorro people. Does the word Guam, is that a, a word that your comfortable with or is it, there's another word you prefer for the land? 

00:23:50
Use the client's words to name their culture 

00:23:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Well, the, the words, there, the name has been, and is really in common use right now. Uhm, it hasn't been officially changed- (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - then it's, the use, the use the word Guahan, which means we have. 

00:24:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Guahan. 

00:24:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Guahan. Uhm, but it isn't official but it's becoming more accepted because that's what we had called our land. 

00:24:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Until, uhm, the Americans came in and simplified it to say Guam. Uh, and, and actually there are a lot of place names that were changed, for example; the, the capital of Guam is, is Hagatña. 

00:24:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But because most people can't say Hagatña, it became Agana. So that's anglicization of the names. 

00:24:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh, it's almost seems like we've heard more about your family in the community genogram and more about the Chamorro people in your family genogram. It's, it's kind of a paradoxical scene but the truth is, uh, you've, you've heard about the Chamorro people, I'd like to hold this here for just a minute and about the history. And I was wondering, either from, we've kind of get the image from your family, and I was wondering if there is a cultural, spiritual, uh, Chamorral image that comes from your discussion that strikes you as important in your being. 

00:25:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, cultural, spiritual? 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Representing your people. 

00:25:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER My people and my family, uhm, I guess that presence, that, that concept or that image of, that we will always be. 

00:25:30
ALLEN E. IVEY We will always be? (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER We will always be here, we will always, uhm, I guess what I'm thinking of this is like there were so many efforts to oppress us. 

00:25:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and to annihilate us, uhm, as far back as the 1,500. 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, but we have survived. 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So Guahan, we have- (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER We have? (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - we will always be. 

00:25:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER We will continue to be --we, we're here. 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, I think it's -- we're survivors, we're resilient, uhm, and also that the stories that are in the traditions- (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or the beliefs about, for example; the spirits, the land,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uh, that still persists and continues. 

00:26:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Okay. So we could, again I just like to cut the positive image in connection to family. Now I'm kinda getting the feeling of strength, spirit, I don't know exactly what that is- (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Resiliency. 

00:26:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - resiliency. Can you kinda put those together in a visual image which represents, that maybe the flag, maybe the land, something that represents all that to you? 

00:26:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER There's, uh, there's an archeological, uhm, structure and it's called the Latte. 

00:26:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And the Latte consists of, of large stones, but there are two of them, one, one is a cone and the other is a cup that sits on top of the cone. It's found nowhere else in the world- (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - except for Guam. And you can still find it on Guam. 

00:27:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, as well as the other Marianas Islands. 

00:27:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, and I think that that signifies for me, the, the presence, the continued presence of the past, the present, and our future. 

00:27:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh, you'll see it on logos. And its, it's, uhm, to me it's a symbol of, of power, resiliency, and strength. 

00:27:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. So you got that symbol of power, resiliency, and strength in your culture. 

00:27:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And interesting enough, you drew that out of your family genogram. You got that (ph) in a community genogram, we really focus on your family and that wonderful feeling of connection here- (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
Anchoring the positive image in the body 

00:27:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - like, uh, resist the power resiliency, how would you (inaudible ) it, you know that. 

00:27:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Oh, it's, it's out here. It's. (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Out here. 

00:27:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. This- (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
ALLEN E. IVEY The warmth, connectiveness(ph), and the resiliency. 

00:27:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER The resiliency. 

00:27:50
The community and family genograms were used to provide a foundation of strength. With this positive foundation, the client is better able to face problems or concerns. Dealing with the negative story 

00:27:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Patricia, we've looked at, uh, what you originally came in to talk about very briefly. 

00:28:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And I'd like to return, return to that and we've always got those resources of resiliency and, uh, strength available to you. And you were talking about the whole issue of sometimes your people not recognize and you are not recognized, I kinda like to hear some more specific stories of what occurred there, what you saw, heard, felt. Tell, could you tell me one of the stories, maybe just one or two what happened. 

00:28:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I think the feeling of not being acknowledged, uh, comes from stories of, uh, well, let me, let me just kinda backtrack and, uhm, share with you when I was in, in school, I was in eighth grade and I had this civics teacher who, you know, we had a full classroom and the civics teacher, uhm, had this attitude and we were in our culture you don't, you were, you were supposed to respect the teacher. 

00:29:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Well this, this teacher had just gotten into this mode of telling us how, uh, we were or Chamorros were ignorant, we were lazy, uhm, we were not gonna get anywhere, uhm, in many, many different words. After awhile it all came down to this, this almost hatred or dislike for us. 

00:29:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, this was a contract teacher who?s brought from mainland to, to Guam. Uhm, and I was, uh, really angry about what he was saying and I was also angry about what was happening which was because of our, our belief that we are not, or a rule that you don't, uhm, speak against authority. Everybody just sat there, but as this man went on and on and on, I just got angry and angrier. And this lack of respect just, just really hit me and I, I just, uhm, broke my pencil and, and threw it on the ground and said some obscenity and walked out. Uhm, and I think he was, I don't know, I was just really angry. 

00:30:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, and I think he did not acknowledge the positive aspects of our culture or he had, he was operating under a certain perspectives of who we were. And he was trying to make us believe it or buy into it. 

00:30:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And he wasn't willing to see, uhm, why maybe we weren't responding. Uhm, so there is just some sense of, uhm, frustration at his attitude. And that he could do this to us and say these things to us in the classroom was, was, more than I could handle, I just, uh, didn't wanna sit in there for, for, anymore. 

00:31:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And what was the upshot(ph) of that. 

00:31:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, of course, I was very upset and afterwards, uhm, he came up to me and he said that I got an A and I said, "Why, why?" You know, I'm still very angry. He said, "It's because you reacted, you got angry." And, and, so I was even angrier about that because how about all of the other people who were going to, uhm, obey the rule and continue to be angry. And he wasn't really thinking about our culture and how, what I did was very wrong, in my culture. 

00:32:00
Teacher is asking for student behavior which is culturally inappropriate 

00:32:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And what he wanted me to do, you know, so, there are two cultures. 

00:32:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER He was wanting something that maybe seen as appropriate. I don't know in what culture that would be, but he wasn't respecting- 

00:32:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or trying to find out why we weren't willing to discuss, uhm, who we were or why this upset us. Uhm, it just wasn't something that was appropriate. Uhm, so that was the upshot(ph). So I was really torn. I can understand why he was doing that but I think his style was very degrading. Uhm, I think what he wanted to do was get us to, to react and get, get excited about school. But what he did do is turn people very much against- 

00:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - education or school or, or what we call howlis(ph). 

00:32:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, Caucasians or, or people from outsiders but we, we use the term to mean more Caucasians. Uhm, so instead of helping us to feel empowered, he tried to disempower us. 

00:33:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And that really upset me. 

00:33:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  This part was really foundational incidence for you. I can tell, you feel a lot of power in that still. 

00:33:20
The pattern of racism continues 

00:33:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. It still comes back to me. Uhm, and, and I think I see it being done by teachers- 

00:33:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - in different ways, but it's basically the same thing. It's somehow, uhm, by humiliating or degrading someone who is poor or someone or who is, who is from a different culture. Somehow the teacher feels more empowered. So I respond to that because its, it's, uhm, I could not identify with those children. 

00:33:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Where they're identified. (ph) Please tell me another story that comes to your mind like the -- or some, or some of the same, same things that occurred to you, you get that some of the same feelings. That's one that goes back a long way. 

00:34:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. But there was, uhm, I think there's a, the other story I wanna share with you is, uhm, uhm, this was at the height of the Vietnam War. 

00:34:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Around 1972 and Guam was where the B52s took off to go bomb Vietnam and there was just an, an incredible presence of, you know, military presence. Uhm, we were very much a part of, uh, the war effort. And we had Chamorros, a lot of Chamorros, uh, were -- join the military because we believed in the United States and, you know, I can see the image of just driving on the road and there?s a bomb, a truck with a flat bed just- (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - full of bombs in front of me and behind my car, there would be another, uhm, another truck. So a sense of patriotism and, uh, a sense of belonging with the United States and my brothers were in an accident when they were 16 and one of my brothers was, uhm, I mean they were both in the hospital, uh, separate hospitals, and Roland(ph) was in a military hospital and I had my friend Doug(ph), who was a core man and he was very upset one day. And we were talking about what upset him and he said he?s just so tired of, of dealing with military, uhm, men, other, other, uhm, people in the navy at the hospital. And what really upset him and upset me was that there was a core man who was asking why he cared so much for us, gooks. 

00:36:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And, so there's that sense of, you know, the United States, these people still don't get it, you know? We are very much a part but that sense of somehow we're, uhm, we're not good enough- 

00:36:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or that we're alien, uhm, or that we're not important. Even though we had, uhm, men dying- 

00:36:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - you know, we had the largest, uhm, fatality rate of any cultural group or any ethnic group. 

00:36:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, so to hear that really upset me because it really captures how insignificant we are. 

00:36:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER You know, and, so you have this, this sense of what is it for and a lot of anger and helplessness. 

00:37:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. And I, I hear that, that image of you between those two trucks and the pride you felt and the safety you felt in relationship with being a part of United States. (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And then almost immediately, this horrendous contrast- 

00:37:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - that this, calling your names and not, no respect at all. 

00:37:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  No. 

00:37:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I can, I can sense that anger. Where do you feel the anger in your body? (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
Negative stories are also rooted in the body 

00:37:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Oh. It's just right here, from just all the all over right here. Uhm. 

00:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY That's very powerful for being, uh, to hear you saying it. It almost brings tears to my eyes, just to, to hear that lack of, lack of respect- 

00:37:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
Taking the positive images to the negative story 

00:37:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - such disrespect. Can we just hang on to that for a minute and go back to that image of the, the family and the connectedness and the latte and resiliency. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  What's happening before you right now? 

00:38:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, it's really hard shifting but I feel a lot better. Uhm, I try to think about my parents and my aunts. 

00:38:40
Positive image partially relieves negative feelings 

00:38:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, but I guess the, the feeling of frustration is still pretty powerful. 

00:38:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:38:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm. 

00:38:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  You have the strength and resiliency in those images. (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
ALLEN E. IVEY That frustration is very much there. 

00:38:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I have to say. 

00:38:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Very much there. 

00:38:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:39:00
[sil.] 

00:39:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Hmm. 

00:39:05
Exploring feelings 

00:39:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  So let's go with that feeling of frustration a little bit more. Can you tell me a little bit with what you're thinking about and feeling at the moment? 

00:39:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Oh, I just, I think about, you know, today, for example or, or the couple last few months or like the last ACA conference, uhm, how varying degrees of the same thing occurs over and over and over, and, I think what gets to me is that the younger generation buys into it and I see my work as being, uh, important not just with my colleagues, uhm, over the profession, uhm, with my people but also with the young children saying don't buy into it. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER It's, it's, it's not true. 

00:40:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, you don't have to believe it. Uhm, this is a sense of caring. Uhm, so I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes I don't, I can't react or respond. I don't think about that incident that Doug(ph) and those, that story because, uhm, it's replaced by less emotionally charged- (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - encounters. 

00:40:30
Personal action to combat prejudice helps the client to deal with the past 

00:40:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And the way I turned it around is, is, okay, well, you don't know anything about Guam. Let me tell you about it, about Guam,- (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - you know, or let me tell you about Chamorros. 

00:40:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  And I get excited. So I'm, I'm replacing that, uhm, frustration with, uhm, a more active sense of, uhm, well there's, there's only one way to change it and that's to be involved and that's, uhm, to talk to the young children and to extend myself. 

00:40:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Okay. So I'd like to kinda bring this phase to a close shortly. 

00:41:00
Microskill of summarization helps organize the interview 

00:41:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh, I really was deeply affected by the whole pattern of going along and feeling things are okay and then boom! Being hit with the names. And I, I kinda felt that almost, might be a metaphor of what you've experience, in one way or another, then it goes along fine, you feel safe in graduate school, and everything went fine then boom! Again, you're not recognized in some way- (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - for your innateness(ph) and stuff that's important and special to you. Am I hearing that at all correctly? 

00:41:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Right. And that's, that's true even within the counseling profession, uhm,- 

00:41:35
Check out your summary with the client 

00:41:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - around my, you know, professional colleagues, uhm the assumption that somehow we're Hispanic even though I've already told you that we're not Hispanic, we're Chamorros, we're from Guam, we're from the Pacific Islands, and then you turn around and, and you say, "Oh yeah, you know, Patricia the one, the what is she, and I guess that lack of, of respect for, wait a minute, I've already said- (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:42:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I'm (inaudible ). And if you tell me that you're, you know, uhm, Native American- 

00:42:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - I guess what I'm trying to do is remember that image so that I can always come back and say, it's like I suggest(ph) respect and it's, it's still there. Uhm, I don't know if I answered your question. I don't remember what the question was. 

00:42:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I think, I think you did. Uh, and again it kinda like to close this out by, you're feeling that so strong and it?s not to take away the strength. It's,they ask you to do the image of the, ah, the Latte, the resiliency,- (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:42:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - the strength, and the family connectedness. Just tell me a little bit about your experience of that. 

00:42:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER The shifting. 

00:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, I think I was starting to think about, uhm, people cared like, uhm, Teri(ph), I talked to her this morning and last night I talked to Charles(ph) in Florida. Uhm, and that, that helped, you know, because it's so recent. 

00:43:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So when, rather than thinking of, of a memory of something that happened years ago, those are still very fresh. 

00:43:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Those are the ones you really have right now. 

00:43:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:43:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Connection. Yeah, I'm reminded of, uh, one of my, uh, African-American friend and she said she could tell how the month had been for her when she looked at her telephone bill. 

00:43:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER (laughing) That's pretty much how it. 

00:43:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  And if, if things had gone pretty smoothly in terms of no racial events, the telephone bill would be pretty low, that there'd been one or two, there would be the phone calls around to talk to people to get those connection. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Oh, to get more, more support. 

00:43:40
ALLEN E. IVEY To get that connection and support. 

00:43:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And so you find ways to get that connection and support in your life right now, have I heard you correctly? (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay. Let's stop for just a moment now. 

00:43:50
Moving to a Reflective Consciousness: Thinking Back About the Stories 

00:43:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Patricia, ah, during the break, we're talking about where we might go next, and, uh, one of the important process is sort of negotiating how we might look at things. We've heard the story, we certainly seen your feelings, and, uh, I told you during the break, uh, in some ways you reminded me of some of my own experience. But nothing like yours. Uh, I'm deeply touched and honored by what you shared. And, uh, I think we might go to a little reflection on this and, uh, that you know (inaudible ) would have people tell her stories- 

00:44:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - and then to reflect on their meaning together, and then, the next phase, he would say, "What do we gonna do about it?" 

00:44:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:44:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And how are we gonna work together ah, on, on these stories of oppression. So, ah,- 

00:44:50
Encouraging a reflective consciousness 

00:44:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - is, at this moment, I'd like to ask the most general question, it was to reflect back upon the stories and what we've done so far, is it , that stands out for you and what occurs for you? 

00:45:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, what occurs for me is that, that lack of or lack of, the ignorance and the lack of respect is, is going to be present. 

00:45:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, It'll be here until I'm gone and after I'm gone because it?s just a part of, of people. 

00:45:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER People will, may not intentionally, sometimes intentionally, but unintentionally, uhm, affect others the same way. 

00:45:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So that's what stands out for me, is that, uhm, you know, it's just primarily ignorance and, and unintentional racism or oppression. I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Or sometimes even intentional. 

00:45:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Sometimes intentional,- (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So, you gonna(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - but it's gonna be there. 

00:45:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, racism, oppression is going to be there? 

00:46:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:46:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Now, given that, uh, thinking back for a moment about your teacher, uh, what could you tell me about your teacher? What was going on for him? 

00:46:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Well, I think, I never really spoke to him and asked him what was going on for him, but what I, you now, reflecting back to what it must've been like for him, uhm, he was far away from home, very far away from home, umm, in a place that the culture is very different, uh, somehow he was on a mission to help us. 

00:46:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And he might have tried different ways of doing it, uhm, and I'm speaking as a teacher, to just try different ways and I think it's, it was the overall frustration- (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - of how you communicate certain things to people. (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:46:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER You really don't know, uhm, and how do I deal with wanting to go home for the holidays but I can't. It's so expensive and so far away, even to call. So, you know, I have to also think about those things. Uhm, later, uhm, on towards, you know, towards the end of the year- (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - he had, uhm, hikes, he'd go invite students to go on hikes- (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - in different parts of the island, and that was, uh, a different side of him- (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - outside of the classroom. He was extending and sharing, uh, something that he enjoyed, uh, and making it possible for, for us to go out, so I could see that he was, he was trying to adjust as well as, as find a way to connect with us. 

00:47:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:47:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And the outdoor seemed to worked well for him. Uhm, so I think he would, he would -- when I look back, it's, it's, he's was just trying to figure out how do I reach students when we were really taught to, to not speak out. 

00:47:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And how was it for you as, what you said at, at that time, for you as a student at that younger age, how was it for you? How did you experience it at that time as you reflect on it now? 

00:48:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I think. 

00:48:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  You're an older person now looking back at that time. 

00:48:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh-huh. Well, I think, when I think about, back that time, you know, seventh grade was just a haze. It's like, I could've been sleeping. (laughs) 

00:48:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But eighth grade, I think I started to become more aware of, of my surroundings, the people that I was, you know, that were in the classes, uhm, the social environment. (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER As well as how I was doing in school, uhm, looking at being involved in different things. So I was not so much self-centered. I was becoming a lot more, you know, moving out, outward- (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, and to hear this from someone who I'm supposed to respect- 

00:48:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. 

00:48:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, really took me aback. Uhm, but I guess if I'm looking at the transition developmentally- (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, I felt that that was probably appropriate given that I didn't have other avenues or outlets. 

00:49:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, you know, I, I couldn't go to a counselor, for example, and say, you know, this teacher is really giving me a hard time or you should hear what he's saying- (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - because that still is inappropriate. Uhm, you have to imagine that in school. 

00:49:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  The teacher is the source of knowledge, power. (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So it still is inappropriate? 

00:49:30
In many cultures, the direct confrontation is inappropriate or rude. 

00:49:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  So, for, for students to raise their hand is, and ask a question is, is challenging teacher's knowledge. 

00:49:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So classrooms can be very quiet. 

00:49:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Ah, even at the university level, you know, it's just, it's part of our culture. Uhm, very little interaction because the person who's in authority- (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - on, whether it's English or Civics- (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and to challenge him or raise a question is, is challenging their knowledge. 

00:50:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

00:50:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I don't know. Does that help? 

00:50:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  As a professor, I, as a teacher, I'm, kind of, wondering as I see that the task of the student so much is to challenge me on my knowledge and where I'm at. 

00:50:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
ALLEN E. IVEY You know, that isn't quite the way you see it then, even yet. 

00:50:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Well, I've come a long ways. 

00:50:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:50:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER You know, uh, I can remember being in school, I mean, at the university level and a French teacher coming and being very upset because she would raise a question and nobody would say anything. And she would raise another question, we all have read the story, you know the, the readings, and she would raise a question and no one would say anything. It's not that we were ignorant. It's that, it was, uhm- 

00:50:50
Individualism is culturally inappropriate for the Chamorro. 

00:50:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - to call attention to one's self is, is considered inappropriate to, uhm, say, "Yes, I know the answer,"- (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - is also inappropriate, you know, You're, you're,- I guess, you're not supposed to share the limelight- (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - because, so, but moving here, for example, in our classes together, I feel very comfortable because I feel that it's, it's the next step. 

00:51:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I can't no, I can't no longer sit back. 

00:51:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, because then I also limit my, my learning. 

00:51:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So in a sense, leaving Guam and that kind of environment has been helpful because I can extend myself- (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - in a way that I would not be able to on Guam. 

00:51:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. But nonetheless the whole idea of challenging and so forth doesn't really feel culturally, still doesn't feel personally or culturally comfortable to you, ah, you could frequently, is that right? 

00:51:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Right. (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER There are classrooms, uh, for example, where, uhm, I will withhold my thoughts- 

00:51:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - until there is, maybe something, somebody says that I feel, well, wait a minute, there's a different perspective. (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And then I will, uhm, contribute. 

00:52:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But for the most part, I'm most comfortable sitting back. That's it. (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
Many individual issues/problems are culturally related 

00:52:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, and actually going ahead and then challenging this guy or the teachers here or, so would it really be a violation of your culture's idea of respect, wouldn't it- 

00:52:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:52:20
ALLEN E. IVEY But you're in a double bind(ph)? 

00:52:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:52:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  But in a sense of, when you, when you go back to the, uhm, when we talked about the cultural history or looking at the family genogram, we talked about shifts. Ah, in a sense, I was really raised in a bicultural environment. 

00:52:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, because the shifts were already made when they started saying, "You couldn't speak in," you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - our language in school, uhm, bad, bad, bad. Uhm, what was being taught was not just the language, the English language. It was the, the American values. 

00:52:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So there's, there?s a real dichotomy that goes on, I think for most Chamorros in identity. 

00:53:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, who are we and, uhm, and where do we go from here and how do we, how do we succeed,- (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - you know, in this society that we're, where we have to be a part of- (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and that we are a part of. Uhm, so for example, talking in, in class- (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - is uncomfortable in Guam- 

00:53:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - because my peers would be looking at me and, "Oh, you know, she knows it all. Don't look at her. Who does she think she is?" 

00:53:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But, ah, here, it's, you know, I don't have that kind of- 

00:53:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - ah, pressure or perception- (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - misplaced upon me. 

00:53:45
ALLEN E. IVEY You know, as I listen here, I realized that's one of the things I find myself, sort of, in fact, if you go back a little bit later and look at this tape, you see there's some kind of half-way(ph) encouraging you to go out and speak up more directly and then I said, "Oh my goodness! I'm actually becoming right here, violating some of your own beliefs and standards when I, when I suggest that." So, I'd like to certainly, like to identify that that I just did and say, "How did you feel when I did that?" Uh, did you pick it up? 

00:54:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  No, I didn't pick it up. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, yeah. So I was thinking that I might like you to stand up a little bit more 'coz I know you can. (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:54:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And then I heard loud and clear. Well that would be a violation in a sense of what you're about. (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER But I also have to remember that- (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - that I was raised with two values- 

00:54:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:54:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - not necessarily congruent, uh, not necessarily the same. 

00:54:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
Biculturality is part of life 

00:54:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, and I think what allows me to be successful in both cultures is that I can shift. 

00:54:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:54:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And I can acknowledge the strengths of the, of the values of both cultures or both societies. Uhm, I think the hardest part is when the person can't shift- 

00:54:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:54:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or stuck, and, and,- (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:54:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and then you become successful or, in only one area, in one culture. (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:54:55
Moving the Reflective Consciousness to Action 

00:54:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  So given that, I think you, you've really clarified that for me, there's that other question we kinda agreed we'd look at is that, okay what would you like to take back? What would you like to do about some of your knowledge and awareness? Ah, how can we work together perhaps even to take some action for the young people, ah, young Chamorro people? 

00:55:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  I think whether it's writing chapters in books that say, you know, here we are. This is who we are. Uhm. Speaking to my relatives who grew up on the mainland and saying, you know, "Here, read this book. This is." You know, and, and let's talk about it. Uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:55:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - so really extending myself as opposed to, uhm, being passive, becoming more active ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - collaborating with you know, with professors to, ah, pursue areas of interest that would, uhm, help both cultures,- (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - both in Guam and out here. 

00:56:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, speaking out, and, and just, just being active, doing something about it is, is what I see is, is, uhm, helpful, and, and, presenting the, the, the image to young Chamorros that, that there's, there's pride in being Chamorro. (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And there's pride in being American. 

00:56:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER You don't have to be, uhm, one or the other because we've evolved- (crosstalk) 

00:56:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - in taking what I think is, is valuable in both cultures- (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and to become who we are, 'coz we're not static. We're constantly growing and changing as people. 

00:56:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And hopefully, the, America has influenced us, and hopefully, you know, we can, in return, influence the United States or individuals. 

00:57:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Ah, so that they can learn from our experience. 

00:57:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Ah, because I think that's where real learning takes place. It's when, when we can share. And- (crosstalk) 

00:57:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - where I would open the ears, you know, your ears, and- (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and others' ears to, not just my culture- 

00:57:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - but to others. 

00:57:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So, then and back to your culture genogram, there really is a real history, not just Chamorro, but American pride you have as well? 

00:57:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Oh, yes. 

00:57:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And you want to act on both sides? 

00:57:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:57:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  And part of that acting is to say, "I am an American and also Chamorro." 

00:57:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:57:45
ALLEN E. IVEY "I'm proud of my language, my history, and my people." 

00:57:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:57:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And if you go back to your self, in that, ah, situation in school, then your message really is, "Be proud and act." 

00:58:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:58:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that right? 

00:58:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. Definitely. (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. And, ah, one of the things I think is worth talking about as we close is, ah, you're very dissertation that you're working on now, Patricia, is focusing on identifying, ah, Pacific, ah, Islanders and, ah, Chamorro, in particular, as specific people with specific ideas and culture and way of being. 

00:58:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

00:58:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And so, and you're very, very academic work, is an action coming from some of that resiliency- 

00:58:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

00:58:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - and pride and connectedness,- (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - which you'd like to share with others. Is that how it all goes? 

00:58:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  I think that would be stage number three. I think to start out with, uhm, just looking at, because of stereotypes of Asian and Pacific Islanders, political, uhm, when you look at how we're categorized- 

00:59:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - it's really, uh, a real disrespect to Asians and the different groups of Asians saying that Koreans are the same as Chinese- 

00:59:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or Japanese, in saying that the Japanese are the same as Palauans in Micronesia or, but what's happening in, in the United States is that we are grouped as if we're one ethnic group. And, so my dissertation is looking at, "Okay, let's, let's take a look at that." 

00:59:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:59:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Ah, "Are we similar? Are we different? In what areas are we similar and in which areas are we different?" So, I see that as a starting place. 

00:59:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And then taking a look at, okay, if we, if the hypothesis is that there is no difference, uhm, then looking and saying, "Okay now, how are we similar?" (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:00:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Under what characteristics are we similar?" And I think, so what I'm trying to do is not just, is to dispel this concept of stereotyping- 

01:00:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - of, uhm, because I think that in itself is, is oppressive. 

01:00:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Because it doesn't respect each group's individuality and the uniqueness and hopefully, what I see, like stage three, is honing in on, okay, how, what character, how can we describe Chamorros? (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Or how can you describe Hawaiians, for example? Uhm, what are, what are, uh, factors or family characteristics that, that is, that holds true for that group? 

01:00:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:00:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And there's always gonna be some diff-, within group difference, but I think it's a starting place. So I see educate, you know, doing the study is, uh, the first step towards, uhm, educating, not just mainstream United States but myself. 

01:00:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So now you put pressure and you got a lot to contribute. 

01:01:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER It's really exciting. (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I'm very excited about it. 

01:01:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  That's so. (crosstalk) 

01:01:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And I really appreciate your help in this. (crosstalk) 

01:01:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Ah, we might just stop for just a moment here and just ask, ah, what one thing, ah, out of this whole series stands out for you, what we've done the day, today? 

01:01:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  I think what stands out for me is, is that I've shared my story. 

01:01:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And it's, it's now the story that's just, that belongs to me. Now it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone who's heard it. 

01:01:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Including people who will hear it. 

01:01:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, and that I find very exciting. 

01:01:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, because it's not small anymore. And you've allowed me the opportunity to move out and, and share my story, so people can learn. 

01:01:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. I know I learned. Again, I see you're honored to share that. Thanks so much. 

01:01:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Thank you. 

01:01:55
Debriefing the Interview 

01:01:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, one thing, as I listen to you, that ah, is you are able to take both the United States acting in a Chamorro sense of respect and being. Now, not all of the Chamorro children have experienced that,- (crosstalk) 

01:02:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:02:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - and it isn't just Chamorro children, it could be a Jewish child on an anti-Semitic situation and an African-American child is going to have all of these sources and supports that you did. 

01:02:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:02:30
ALLEN E. IVEY To deal with this, what would you like to see happen for that child and how would you like to see it happen in terms of meeting their needs? 

01:02:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I think, uhm, what I like to see happen is, is for the teacher or the school system, but the teacher in particular to, to try to learn what it's like for that child. 

01:03:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER What is happening is happening in that child life that is making it difficult for the child to, to make that transition- (crosstalk) 

01:03:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - as opposed to, uhm, coming, you know, having assumptions- 

01:03:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, based on what a teacher may see. So I see it as educating the teacher and encouraging the teacher or the school system, if it's a unique situation is, is, what can a school do to educate all the adults in school. (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:03:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So well, let's more(ph) educate the children- (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:03:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - because the children are very much aware of, ah,- (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:03:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - of perceptions and, and feelings that teachers have. So. (crosstalk) 

01:03:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. And so much the school setup in the hierarchal way- (crosstalk) 

01:03:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - with the children are expected to act as the school expects. The school, if the children are respectful, the teachers really have a very hard time learning that the children are not necessarily what they think they are. So there is an immense need for the, the teachers and the school to learn about the culture and ways and being of the people. 

01:04:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right, and for the children also to be taught to respect the differences. 

01:04:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  To be taught that, well this, this person is from, uhm, a country in Africa,- (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, and maybe inviting the family or inviting the child to talk a little bit about it but with respect, as, as opposed to saying, "Well, let's hear about it." Uhm, showing a real sincere interest in,- (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - in what the child does, uhm, you know, particularly like holidays, the American holidays. What is it that you do that is like this? So, uhm, really extending yourself as a teacher, uhm, to find out what their world is like and, and what are the wonderful things that they can bring into the school or into that community. So that the children also respect that child- 

01:04:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - as well as the teachers respect that child and their family. So I don't see this as just being the teacher's role or the schools' role. I see it as simple, as having an impact on that child, but also the, the classroom and, and, and the other children at school. Because that kind of, uhm, discrimination or, or oppression doesn't happen in isolation. When a child sees, when children see a teacher respond a certain way- 

01:05:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - they think it's, it gives some license to behave that way also. 

01:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, okay. 

01:05:25
END SEGMENT 1 Issues of Social Justice with a White Male Celtic/Anglo Client Patricia Pier Interviews Allen Ivey 

01:05:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm, tonight we're gonna be doing ah, number of things, uhm, to illustrate psychotherapy, it's liberation. Ah, I've known Allen for slightly over a year, and we've worked together and through our work together, ah, we've come to know each other and a little bit about our heritage. Ah, what we are going to do today is we're going to be looking at his community genogram and his, ah, family genogram, as well as talking about ah, a concern that he has and my understanding is that it's looking at being bicultural or biculturalism, uhm, of European-Americans. Okay. What it means for him to be bicultural and a European-American. So what we're gonna be doing is, we're gonna be going through a number of different exercises or experiences to help him learn a little bit more about himself and his self in relations to others as well as to his, uh, culture. Uhm, and I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and start with Allen. 

01:06:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay. 

01:06:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Allen is gonna be showing us his, uhm. 

01:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Can I bring it over here? 

01:07:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. Well, he's done both the, the family genogram, as well as his community genogram. Okay, first of all, so, I have a sense of, of what, where, which community you are, the community you would like to share with us. I'd like you to go ahead and talk(ph) this set one first,- (crosstalk) 

01:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:07:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - if that's okay with you. 

01:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I think you can see up there, ah, Patricia, you might think of this as the type of little island at the top, ah, I can kinda see it here in the TV monitor. Ah, I can see at the top, the Swinomish, ah,- (crosstalk) 

01:07:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:07:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, Nation, which is a native American Indian nation lived about eight miles from the home. 

01:07:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY At the bottom, you have my hometown of Mt. Vernon, about three miles from home and in the middle of this is basically- (crosstalk) 

01:07:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:07:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - one mile, and that's kinda the tight little world in which I grew up. We have here, ah, my home. 

01:08:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:08:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  A mile away, my school,- 

01:08:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:08:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - down here my mother's aunt's farm which adjoined my dad's folks' farm- 

01:08:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:08:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - and the Xs represent the friends I played with. If you look at there, there's actually five Xs. So I had five people I could play with when I grew up. 

01:08:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:08:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And you might call that, ah, little bit of a small world. 

01:08:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY A little bit of a small world, that is a very tight little community. 

01:08:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:08:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, ah, my dad ran a store. 

01:08:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:08:35
ALLEN E. IVEY It's primarily a farming community. 

01:08:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:08:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, it may sound strange but, ah, my predominant memory really is this, uhm, being very alone in this community. 

01:08:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Hmm. 

01:08:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I felt very supported by the family and obviously there's close connections. 

01:09:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

01:09:00
ALLEN E. IVEY But everybody else is a farmer, and it really showed up so much when I went to school. And, ah, basically that, ah, there, there is ah, an "N" word for African-Americans, it's really unpleasant. 

01:09:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

01:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, I am actually a, a, a Baptist but because my dad ran a store, I was called ah, Jewish all the time,- (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Hmm. 

01:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - except with all the anti-Semitic epithet you can think about ah, and the, the "K" word they'd use. I'd rather not use the word, I find is so offensive. So I grew up basically everyday going to school with this horrendous type of things, the things might be fine one day but the next day, you know, there'd be something said about my dad- (crosstalk) 

01:09:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:09:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - or something like that. It did a lot that the kids would do is that I never told my parents what was going on- (crosstalk) 

01:10:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - but I built up kind of a reservoir of anger, frustration and a lot of self-blame what was wrong with me. 

01:10:05
The Community's Genogram's first objective is to identify positive community and cultural resources. With some clients, they will immediately focus on the negative. Listen, but aim to draw out positive community resources early in the session. 

01:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Was wrong with me. It's. (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Oh, you were internalizing. 

01:10:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Internalizing, all a lot of, a lot of anger and rage but also with myself. So that, ah, that is kind of the tone- 

01:10:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:10:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - and in that context the, strangely enough, ah, the only person I really think that was really nice to me as a kid- 

01:10:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - well there is one, one older fellow across the street that, ah, the kids get these distorted images but there is- (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - Tandy Rover(ph), who's the manager of the Swinomish nation. 

01:10:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And on his way back and forth to Mt. Vernon, which was at county city(ph), he would often stop at my dad's store and he was, well, just ah, a big good-looking guy and very pleasant and even he was this high official in the, in the Swinomish Nation, he would still take time to say hello to me and so forth. (crosstalk) 

01:11:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So this is a very special thing for me. 

01:11:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, and it was a different kind of tone. (crosstalk) 

01:11:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:11:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And as I sit there and talk about it, it really sounds strange. Yeah, sure, I am a white European-American but my experience growing up is really, as I look back, I know it seems kinda bizarre. 

01:11:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, with, ah, the tight little island and yet really hearing this stuff at school, "Hey these kids didn't, ah, learn that stuff." 

01:11:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. Allen I'd like, I'd like you to help me here because- 

01:11:30
Focus on concrete specifics to move client away from abstractions 

01:11:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - I'm, trying to get this, this image of, of this island, what you call an island. Ah, can you tell me, like the population, I mean, is it very rural? 

01:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, rural, there'd be, you know, to, what my, my school for example, there were three people on the first grade and by the time I hit the seventh grade I was the only person in the seventh grade. (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It would have been, there are two rooms, two rooms in grade school with ah,- (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:11:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - probably 25 kids in the whole school. So it's a very small world. (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER All right. So the kids about your age, you played, you played with them. 

01:12:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, like there would be five that I would occasionally play with,- (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - but it would be ride your bike and so forth. 

01:12:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And yet their parents would be those ones. 

01:12:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  When I, when I'm hearing you describe this, I'm hearing, uhm, you're talking about the Baptist church, but there is all this, also this undertone and that undertone about people using the "N" word that you- (crosstalk) 

01:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY With the "K" word. 

01:12:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - the "K" word,- (crosstalk) 

01:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:12:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, so there's, it sounds like there's some emotion. Uhm, I'm not sure if it's the Baptist church or is it just the community. (crosstalk) 

01:12:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. The Baptist church actually represented to some extent an escape- (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - in the wonderful Sunday school teacher and, ah,- (crosstalk) 

01:12:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - in that sense, the spiritual dimension becomes- (crosstalk) 

01:12:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - one of the salvations when I got older- 

01:12:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, to provide some protection against the, well, against the community, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:12:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:12:50
ALLEN E. IVEY You can tell, I got, I got, I'm just amazed, I start talking about the community and I start- (crosstalk) 

01:12:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yeah. 

01:12:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - almost moving to that rage again. (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY It's, it's interesting how you hold up that stuff from your childhood, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:13:00
Starting the search for positives 

01:13:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Yes, I can see that you really respond to that now. And what I'd like you to do is, is, I get a sense that there's, there's, uhm, something very positive about this community, this community ground or this, this place where you grew up- (crosstalk) 

01:13:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and right now I can really feel that you're focusing on some of the things that were very hurtful to you. (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. And become(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
Getting in touch with breathing May help client slow down and focus 

01:13:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  So rather than, than moved in that direction, what I want you to do is just take, take a deep breath. And we'll, we'll come back to that. 

01:13:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Because I really like to hear about your folks, your family. 

01:13:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:13:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And, uhm, that might help me understand, uh, your other sources of supporter within the community. We talked about some friends, and it doesn't sound like that school is a positive part. 

01:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So let's talk a little bit about your family. So what we're gonna do is just move on to the family genogram, if that's ok with you. 

01:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And, and then we'll, we'll go from there. 

01:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY The family, ah, I think, is like, and I look back on it,- (crosstalk) 

01:14:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - it really was wonderful to have my, ah, the family, they are so close in such a network- (crosstalk) 

01:14:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - and I truly miss that. 

01:14:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:14:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I think that's one of the reason I've been through staying, staying here in Amherst so long, It's just the thought of leaving family I thought is, is, is really very painful to me. (crosstalk) 

01:14:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:14:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And so that I, I really treasure the closeness that we did have get together. It's really nice to have a grandmother one way and the aunts the other way. 

01:14:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY It was a wonderful supportive network, ah, really wonderful family that, ah,- (crosstalk) 

01:14:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - so that was the positive and I think, in real essence, I think it really have a real solid, ah, supportive family as I grew up as a young child. It's when I got older that I ran on this other stuff that so obviously- (crosstalk) 

01:14:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:14:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - enrages me. 

01:14:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. Well, why don't you tell me about your family? 

01:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:15:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER That would be helpful. Uhm, tell me about this part before we go up, up to the specific names. (crosstalk) 

01:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Even, even the family is not all positive, it's kinda two dimensions that I draw. I, I, I drew the family tree obviously, in a very non-traditional way. 

01:15:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh-huh. 

01:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, I come from my, dad comes from a Cornish-Celtic tradition, not British, Cornish-Celtic- 

01:15:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - and Druidic as well and, ah, the messages coming from that family is more one of being an endurance, achievement- (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:15:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - is not a value. 

01:15:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, I remember, I have such wonderful memories of ah, my grandfather. He was just a wonderfully kind man and- (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - his typical reaction in relationship to me was accept me the way I was, and some, and sometime I remember him saying, "Let the boy be." 

01:15:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:15:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And I think that was more in that Cornish tradition very, very supportive. 

01:15:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Accepting and supportive. 

01:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And I have a lot of the same acceptance from the English side, the other farm. (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  But there's always an underlying message of achieve,- (crosstalk) 

01:16:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Oh. 

01:16:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - do something, you are who you are because of what you do. 

01:16:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And I think that has these pluses and minuses and so I'm always doing something and trying to accomplish something and achieving is terribly important. 

01:16:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. And which family your dad's folks share your mom's aunts? So,- (crosstalk) 

01:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  My dad's folks would be here. (crosstalk) 

01:16:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - so they were really living very closely? Both families were- (crosstalk) 

01:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Very close to each others. Yes. 

01:16:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - were very close to one another. So you were getting those types of messages? 

01:16:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Same time? 

01:16:30
ALLEN E. IVEY That you can do it but you, but be where you are. 

01:16:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Sometimes those messages were supportive other times incongruent. 

01:16:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY As you can imagine. 

01:16:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  The very non-traditional community genogram is the way that I now think about genogram. 

01:16:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:16:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And that is that you could, up here, we have me. 

01:16:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. 

01:16:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, I tend to think of myself as in a net-, a family network, rather than myself at the center of the genogram. 

01:17:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:17:00
ALLEN E. IVEY On the left we have ah, Liz, Kathy, Bill, and John and their, their families- 

01:17:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:17:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - and those, and the grandchildren. And then the other side we have my dad and mother. 

01:17:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. 

01:17:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, their families as well. And so I, sort of, see myself as, sort of, an intersection ah, where messages and ideas flow through- 

01:17:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - onto the rest of the family. 

01:17:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Do, it sounds like a switchboard. 

01:17:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Is that how you feel about your family that you somehow keep people connected? 

01:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, no. It isn't really what I feel like, I described this as a switchboard by saying that I am who I am- 

01:17:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - because of my connections. 

01:17:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. 

01:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I am who I am because of my connections. 

01:17:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And to some extent, that sometimes they draw a genogram with the, with the identified patient or myself, for example, at the center of the genogram- (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. Center. 

01:17:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - and I find myself uncomfortable with that, with the traditional way of putting me- (crosstalk) 

01:18:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:18:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - as the focus of the genogram. (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:18:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm trying to think of myself in a relationship- 

01:18:05
Self in-relation 

01:18:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - to these other people. That's where the time earlier on- (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - I might have focused on myself. And now,- (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - I can, I am because they are. 

01:18:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

01:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, that is so important to me. 

01:18:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So important to me, those connections. 

01:18:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay, great. When, when we're talking about this side of the family and this side of the family, are both sides of the family represented up there? 

01:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yes. 

01:18:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY On one side comes really from the old country, around 1900. 

01:18:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Oh. 

01:18:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, ah, I can identify on a computer database that over 3,000 identifiable relatives. 

01:18:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Wow! 

01:18:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, that's worldwide if it is both connection. (crosstalk) 

01:18:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:18:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, ah, other side is very, very, and that would be characteristic unlike of the Cornish, who's the, who's the large extended family network. 

01:19:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

01:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Where in the English side I can identify probably most five to 10 people that I know. 

01:19:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Hmm. 

01:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And, uh, it's a classic family of you, start in New Bedford, Massachusetts, you go to Alden in New York, you go to Dade(ph) County in Missouri and then on out. And, uh, it's kind of the classic history of American men of his destiny. I guess that side. I feel mixed feelings about in terms of, that's the pioneer story of United States. 

01:19:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

01:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And I said, "Oh! That's the pioneer story of the United States." And so there's Indian fighters and all kinds of people who would take the land and so forth- (crosstalk) 

01:19:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:19:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - in that particular side of the family and so I feel, kind of, squeegee(ph) about that- 

01:19:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:19:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - on our traditional side. 

01:19:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Of being descendants of people who are doing these things? 

01:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, basically, as the center, in that sense, I have to, from my perspective, we are often oppressors. 

01:19:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:19:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Well that was very helpful, uhm, it sounds like you've, you've taken what is, what is valuable from both, both sides of your family and internalize them. The sense of endurance and appreciation for who you are. 

01:20:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:20:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I hear that very clear. There is also the sense of achievement,- 

01:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, which is, that sounds like it brings you a lot of ah, satisfaction and- (crosstalk) 

01:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:20:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - well being. So, now that we've looked at your community gram and your family geogram. What I'd like to do- 

01:20:35
Seeking again to generate positive images 

01:20:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - is, is shift a little bit and, and I want you to tell me a story or tell me about a time when you felt very safe within this, this environment. 

01:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I want you to just take a little time and try to develop that image, the time when you felt safe and accepted for who you were. 

01:21:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  This time I'm, ah, at my grandfather's place, the Cornish side- 

01:21:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - and it's in a farm and I think an image of riding on the hay near behind the horses at that time,- (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - getting on top of the, the hay at (inaudible ) on the barn, just being there and- 

01:21:38
Still somewhat abstract and formal operational 

01:21:38
ALLEN E. IVEY - grandfather basically doing what he is going to do, but kind of knowing that he would kinda watch out for me and the sense of freedom of being in myself yet still being in connection with it. 

01:21:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:21:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I think that's what occurs to me. 

01:21:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I want you to think about- 

01:22:00
Moving toward concreteness sensorimotor operations 

01:22:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - you told me a little bit about the things that you're seeing. 

01:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I want you to tell me a little bit more. So you see the, the haystack, you seemed working- 

01:22:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, the team working, the haystack- 

01:22:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. I want you to tell me about the smell- 

01:22:15
Sensorimotor 

01:22:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER (inaudible ) 

01:22:16
ALLEN E. IVEY It's such a wonderful ah, smell of the new morn(ph)- 

01:22:20
The image sinks in at a sensorimotor level 

01:22:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - the, the hay just as drying and bringing in- 

01:22:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:22:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - and the scratchy, crinkly feeling,- (crosstalk) 

01:22:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:22:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - the sinking in, ah- 

01:22:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  And your in it. 

01:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - and your in it. Ah, it's a wonderful feeling. (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I feel sorry that kids today don't have that experience with a hay mile and the hayride. It is. (crosstalk) 

01:22:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. So. (crosstalk) 

01:22:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And particularly when it's real. 

01:22:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER It looks as if it's still real for you. 

01:22:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. The smells and, and the sense of your grandfather being there and not necessarily having to be there holding your hand but his presence brings you a lot of, uhm, color it appears ah- (crosstalk) 

01:22:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm, and strength. 

01:23:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - strength? 

01:23:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:23:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:23:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Calmness and strength. 

01:23:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. Why do you feel that, when you're closing your eyes and you were developing that image where do you feel that sense of. (crosstalk) 

01:23:10
Locating the image in the body. 

01:23:10
ALLEN E. IVEY It's kind of, ah, a movement. I want to breathe in and this, sort of,feel it- (crosstalk) 

01:23:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. Take in. 

01:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - come in and go out, and back again, a circular type of movement. (crosstalk) 

01:23:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Circular movement. 

01:23:20
ALLEN E. IVEY In and out, yeah. 

01:23:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  You're breathing in- (crosstalk) 

01:23:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:23:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - you can smell the hay and can feel- (crosstalk) 

01:23:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:23:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - the sense, the warmth, and the support and the strength- (crosstalk) 

01:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:23:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - of your grandfather is, is there. Okay. I want you to, to fill yourself with that image again. 

01:23:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:23:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:23:45
[sil.] 

01:23:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. How do you feel right now? 

01:23:55
ALLEN E. IVEY It's very centering(ph). Just to, that's it. 

01:24:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. Very centering(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:24:00
ALLEN E. IVEY There isn't any more, doesn't, doesn't need for any more. 

01:24:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. That's wonderful. I think what I'd like you to do is remember that image because when I ask you to call upon later on as we, as we work together. Uhm, I'd like to shift a little bit, uhm, I know that you had spoke earlier about being bicultural and being European-American and what it means for you, but what would help me right now is, uhm, I want you to think or tell me a story or a time in your life- 

01:24:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:24:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - when you felt not so safe. 

01:24:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:24:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Ah, it could be you're feeling like you're, ah, low down, you feel depressed or frustrated, or some of those emotions. I want you to think of that time that you're, you'd like to share with me. 

01:24:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:25:00
[sil] 

01:25:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  I think I'm in about the second or third grade. 

01:25:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:25:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, it's one of those windy, fall days, bright and clear. I was sitting at the corner of the schoolyard and there, just holding my coat up, just feeling the wind blowing kinda halfway holding me up and, ah, in the middle (inaudible ) right comes some older kids around the door,- 

01:25:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:25:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - around, around the corner, and started calling me some of those names that I mentioned. 

01:25:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And just the, the pain that I felt at that point, and the alienation, the humiliation. 

01:25:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Humiliation. 

01:25:55
ALLEN E. IVEY It was really, ah. 

01:26:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So it took up a moment that was, was very, uhm, enjoyable, standing there with the wind, its nice, cool breeze, and your arms around just embracing it. 

01:26:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:26:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And somehow, their presence and their coming in to the picture somehow changed it. 

01:26:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:26:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. What was on the feelings? Can you name a feeling for me that can describe that, that experience? 

01:26:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, loneliness,- 

01:26:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

01:26:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - shame, the fear because they were bigger,- 

01:26:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:26:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, puzzlement, what have I done wrong? 

01:26:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:26:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm, and I think just, ah, ah, almost like it's kind of like, ah, a valve or will I really ever be safe again? 

01:27:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:27:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And as I said that, ah, I kinda felt just a little bit beginning of tears in my eyes. That, it's kinda like, "Oh my God, this world is not such a pleasant place." 

01:27:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  So what happened afterwards? They came up to you and they started talking, tell me what happened next. You were having all of these of emotions, very powerful emotions. 

01:27:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  I didn't think I, I, I. (crosstalk) 

01:27:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER How did it end? 

01:27:50
ALLEN E. IVEY How did it end? 

01:27:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:27:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I suppose a bell. I don't really remember any. I think the bell must have rang. I went inside and sat down- (crosstalk) 

01:27:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:27:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - on my desk and go to room at school. 

01:28:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. Does that image stayed with you all these years? 

01:28:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Now. (crosstalk) 

01:28:05
ALLEN E. IVEY You know, I think it -- and I think that image probably is metaphoric of what I went through for the seven years that I was in that school- (crosstalk) 

01:28:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:28:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - one way or another. 

01:28:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. It, it sound like you didn't have a sense of escape that you could leave that experience somehow. 

01:28:25
ALLEN E. IVEY No. 

01:28:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER You were stuck and you have to face it- 

01:28:25
Reflection of negative feeling 

01:28:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and feel your, your humiliation, and your frustration, and your loneliness. 

01:28:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:28:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  It was joyful on the seventh grade, I went into this holiday from school, got away from all of that. Like there's a part of me that kinda likes to move away and get, and leave it all behind. 

01:28:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. So there, in that community, you also have this, this feeling of alienation- (crosstalk) 

01:28:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:28:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and not being accepted. 

01:28:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER It must have been very difficult for a child. 

01:29:00
ALLEN E. IVEY It's difficult for a child and, ah, as I begin to understand that type of thing later on, it makes me, uh, kinda weary about the whole status of the racialism and all of that in, in this country. And I think that is -- maybe I should over generalize that personal experience. But I still run into that type of thing enough and say, "Hey, this is a very real part- 

01:29:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:29:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - of our society." 

01:29:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

01:29:30
ALLEN E. IVEY A very real part. 

01:29:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER What I find ironic is that, are you a Jew? 

01:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY No. 

01:29:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. But yet- (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Baptist thing. 

01:29:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - but yet. (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
ALLEN E. IVEY It was also kind of fascinating, by the way. (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:29:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  My, my first job was in Boston University and for the first time I really ran into Jewish kids, "Hey, I can relate to these kids." My childhood experience was like theirs. (laughing) (crosstalk) 

01:29:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER From their experience? 

01:29:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:29:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER How interesting. (crosstalk) 

01:29:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, I mean not like all of theirs, there's been a number of them. 

01:29:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Hmm. So it'sm, this place was a place of safety as well as a place where there was a lot of pain? 

01:30:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yes. 

01:30:00
Looking for continuing patterns in today's life 

01:30:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. I like to move to another story,- (crosstalk) 

01:30:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:30:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - it's okay with you? 

01:30:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:30:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  I would like you to think again about another time in your life- (crosstalk) 

01:30:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:30:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - where you, you were feeling much of the same feelings or not necessarily the same feelings but you are feeling, uhm, frustrated, alienated, depressed, ah, helpless. 

01:30:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Hmm, I think I sometimes feel that way now. Ah, ah, it's, it's, it's piecemeal(ph) that I sometimes feel that type of thing in a relationship, say to certain things that I see happening in professional associations. 

01:31:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:31:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, where things seem okay and suddenly it's like, wow. 

01:31:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:31:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, I almost hate the name of the associations, they're pretty well known I guess. 

01:31:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, these people have a long way to go and they become aware of the importance of oppression, racism,- (crosstalk) 

01:31:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:31:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - and sometimes feel, any, any, anything is basic, sometimes feel that, ah, I feel it's a long way to go professionally. 

01:31:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Okay. 

01:31:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So some of the stuff that I saw, ah, in that tight little world,- (crosstalk) 

01:31:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:31:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - I guess, is there. 

01:31:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Okay. 

01:31:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It gets me down knowing that. 

01:31:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. That this. (crosstalk) 

01:31:55
ALLEN E. IVEY All I gotta do is read a magazine in some days. 

01:31:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh-huh. 

01:31:55
Note that Allen tends to intellectualize. Patricia's strategies with this type of client are well worth observing 

01:31:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  What I like you to do though is, I mean, you're talking about something you're really intellectually listening. What I want you to do is think about, uhm, an experience or an image,- 

01:32:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:32:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or an experience where, that can describe that, what you just said. 

01:32:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  In concrete with the negative one? 

01:32:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Yes. 

01:32:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

01:32:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Is there any one time where, where. 

01:32:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  I can think of them, the thing is I'm sitting there. It's like (inaudible ) do I really wanna to put all of these on public TV. (crosstalk) 

01:32:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER (Laughing) Oh, I understand. 

01:32:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, yes, ah. (crosstalk) 

01:32:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So, so a part of that is the frustration at. (crosstalk) 

01:32:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Absolutely, immense frustration, ah, with the fear- (crosstalk) 

01:32:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, at the slowness to recognize the multicultural issues and occasionally, I think I feel some of that same rage ah. (crosstalk) 

01:33:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. That being the little kid. 

01:33:05
ALLEN E. IVEY That being a little kid and I say: "Hey this stuff is important." And it, boom! 

01:33:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

01:33:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And the thing is I know I'm being very abstract to that one. I am frankly, sets it into, to open up in front of the whole world is like- (crosstalk) 

01:33:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Certainly. 

01:33:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - there's this event, there's this event, there's this event,- (crosstalk) 

01:33:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Right. 

01:33:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - there's this event and I think there's been a lot of improvement professionally and ah, I could. 

01:33:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Well, it's understandable. You know,- (crosstalk) 

01:33:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:33:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - there's, there's also that respect for your, your relationships- (crosstalk) 

01:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:33:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and I, I respect that. 

01:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:33:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, what I'd. (crosstalk) 

01:33:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm protecting the guilty. At least the guilty at my event, you know. 

01:33:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uh hmm. 

01:33:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I feel guilty about that even. 

01:33:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER About thinking of them as being guilty? (crosstalk) 

01:33:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:33:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  But I think what, what you've, you've described to me, Allen, is that your experience of being discriminated against, ah, oppressed and really being forced to feel alienated,- 

01:34:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:34:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, continues because- (crosstalk) 

01:34:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:34:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - people are not, or not, have not experienced, or not willing to admit the experience of being in the position you were as a child. (crosstalk) 

01:34:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:34:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And some of the frustration that I hear you trying to describe is, is that you have these associations that are supposed to be nurturing,- 

01:34:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:34:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - supportive, but by the very nature of not owning up to,- 

01:34:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:34:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - to continue systematic, ah, and professional, if you wanna call it amnesia,- (crosstalk) 

01:34:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:34:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - that these people that, that are working, the people we are working with have all had experience as such as yours and such as mine,- 

01:35:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:35:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, and what do we do about it,- 

01:35:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:35:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, am I, am I? 

01:35:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Yeah, I think you're, you're- (crosstalk) 

01:35:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Describing. (crosstalk) 

01:35:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - hearing pretty accurately. There is also, that I mentioned this and I said, "Who am I as a, as a White person to talk about discrimination and so forth?" Because I can escape it. 

01:35:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:35:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and I'm not a person with color- 

01:35:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:35:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - and, ah, so I don't, really don't experience, ah, day in and day out, that stuff. 

01:35:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:35:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, so that, ah, to some extent I feel some of the things I'm saying are perhaps all based on naive but I, I certainly from me, the multicultural and the, the gender affair and stuff is just, such a vital part of my being and then I start criticizing myself, my inability to measure up to my own standards. I mean, this, that's, that's part of that,- (crosstalk) 

01:35:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:35:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - is that I, I've been raised to such high demands and sometimes I can never meet the demands and I feel a little harm(ph) on me,- 

01:36:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:36:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - although I put on myself. (crosstalk) 

01:36:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. And, and I see,- 

01:36:05
Positive reframe 

01:36:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - I see that you've channeled your experience as a child into, in utilizing your, your, uhm, historical roots, that is the sense of endurance and acceptance, as well as achievement to, to deal with some of the issues that you feel are so important and even though you're not experiencing, uh, discrimination in this, you know, at this age, I think it sounds as if, uhm, you can still identify and still understand and be empathic towards people who are experiencing it themselves. 

01:36:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  I, I hope so. (crosstalk) 

01:36:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:36:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  I, I've not been in somebody else's skin but I sure know what it's like to be isolated. 

01:36:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:36:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  I mean, that's a surprise. I mean, if you look at the stuff that you're talking about in the last tapes, you know, it, it really caught me. The one that, that caught me was the idea of feeling safe between those two sets of bombs, you know,- (crosstalk) 

01:37:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:37:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - and then boom! Next thing you know, the bombs are going on you, you know, that's the,- (crosstalk) 

01:37:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:37:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - that's what I really can identify at emotional level- (crosstalk) 

01:37:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:37:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - of that. And, uh, I hate to see people in pain and I hate, I hate unfair. Another wonderful construct out of the British roots is the concept of fairness. They're all seems in this adamantly(ph) unfair. (crosstalk) 

01:37:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. Unfair. 

01:37:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Unfair. 

01:37:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  And that had. (crosstalk) 

01:37:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And yet you're, you're totally right, is that I think my best attempt to synthesize, is I hang on there between the two cultures and as, uh, it used some of the drive, the British drive for achievement, uh, in fair play, this sometimes, well, let's not just put myself ahead. Let's see what we can, can do in terms of service. And so many think within this culture, which go against that and yet I do the best I can by, I do the best I can but the best I can isn't good enough. 

01:38:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Hmm. 

01:38:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  So. 

01:38:05
Reframing the negative images from the family genogram 

01:38:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER I'd like to offer you a reframing, if that's okay with you. (crosstalk) 

01:38:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:38:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  This image is, it's ah, an image where you're static- 

01:38:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:38:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and you're helpless- 

01:38:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:38:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and I think after knowing you and your work and how you really, uhm, abdicated(ph) to people, the image that I, I see is more of a swing- 

01:38:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:38:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and that, you know, you're moving back and forth when you, when you hear people experience, uhm, some very powerful emotions. You take a step back and you re-experience- 

01:38:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:38:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - what it's like and then move out. 

01:38:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:38:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So it's never really a static, I don't know, how does that image? 

01:38:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It fits, ah, it fits, ah, as you talk about that, that image of the swing is that, as I struggle to understand the, the gay and lesbian, it,- (crosstalk) 

01:39:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:39:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - it really was, I really had to retreat to some of my own experience, the oppressions. (crosstalk) 

01:39:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:39:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, this is what they're saying. I could identify with that- 

01:39:10
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:39:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - and it moves me from, make, actually, has moved me to more of an advocate. 

01:39:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:39:15
The reframe works! 

01:39:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So now, that's my, I guess, I guess that person can swing as well as it probably be static. Now why not swing with it? (Laughing) 

01:39:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER (Laughing) 

01:39:25
Debriefing the Session 

01:39:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  I think, I think this, this session is much different from what we had done with me and part of it is that you've, you've, through your life's work, you've been able to bring yourself through many of your own stages and actually it's through your, your living, that you've been able to develop and work with people and develop this, this therapeutic model. So in a sense, our session is not typical on what, what people would experience or what people would try to coconstruct in what they know with others. (crosstalk) 

01:40:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, yeah 'coz both of these really start with an awareness of who we are,- (crosstalk) 

01:40:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:40:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - so much related to our culture background and our family background. We start with that assumption. 

01:40:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:40:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  And as person goes through this, really, one of the targets is to start develop increasing awareness. That you are a person that developed- 

01:40:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:40:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - in a relationship- (crosstalk) 

01:40:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:40:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - and to that extent, our, our models here or neither of your or my models are particularly good one, one person might learn, and yet the questions in the process is similar. 

01:40:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. And when we think about the, the questions in the process, uah, one is first, just getting to know one another- (crosstalk) 

01:40:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:40:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - whether its through community,- (crosstalk) 

01:40:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:40:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - looking at the families, uh, and what it means to be a member of that family. (crosstalk) 

01:40:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:40:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER It also kind of let the next progression, I was looking for, uh, an image where there was a sense of safety and I find that extremely valuable because in terms of working with someone who is, is extremely vulnerable, uhm, it's nice to have a place where they can move back to. 

01:41:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And I guess that's where Mary comes in. 

01:41:20
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  That's where Mary, can you tell me more about that? (crosstalk) 

01:41:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Very well, Mary is of course, ah, the woman I live with, my wife, my co-author, my friend. I guess she kind of feels the function that the hay mile did deep,- (crosstalk) 

01:41:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Today. 

01:41:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - and safe, and friendly, and warm, and all that. 

01:41:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. 

01:41:40
ALLEN E. IVEY A place to go, a refuge, I hope I'm some(ph) of that for her. 

01:41:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uh hmm. Well I'm sure you do that for one another because you've left Mount Vernon. You're now here. (crosstalk) 

01:41:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Absolutely. 

01:41:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  And you don't have the family to provide that support but you have Mary. 

01:41:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:42:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER You also have students who care very much. (laughing) 

01:42:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Right. Thank you. 

01:42:00
Patricia Summarizes The Session 

01:42:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  Uhm and, and in, I'm trying to, uh, what I was trying to do earlier was kind of, uhm, highlight what it would, what accounts there would be doing in the session. (crosstalk) 

01:42:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:42:25
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER So after we, by the sense of safety, we would ask the person to describe, uhm, an experience- 

01:42:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:42:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - where they were feeling pain- 

01:42:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:42:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and using whatever words fit for that person, if it's a child or if it's, uh, uhm, an adult or elderly person or taking, being sensitive to the cultural- (crosstalk) 

01:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:42:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - as well as socio-economic status of the person, being respectful in choosing the word- (crosstalk) 

01:42:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:42:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - because a person might not identify being oppressed,- 

01:42:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:42:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, but may identify with being frustrated. 

01:43:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:43:00
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Ah, and if necessary, going back to the place of safety- 

01:43:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:43:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and after moving on, moving on the next step would be asking them to think of about another time in their life when, when they also felt that sense of pain and frustration,- 

01:43:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:43:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - uhm, and the process, correct me if I'm wrong, the process is to help them look for similarities- 

01:43:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:43:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - or, uhm, commonalities between the stories- 

01:43:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:43:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and what does it mean, what do those experiences mean? 

01:43:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:43:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER  And helping them to name it,- 

01:43:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:43:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - what is it? Uhm, for you as a sense of being discriminated against and, and humiliated. Uh, that being sense of, being helpless and, and as an adult, you're, it was a little different because for professional reasons you would, you know, it's, it wouldn't be appropriate for you to go into it- 

01:44:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - but for, in working with someone else, it might be helping the person try to name the experience or the feeling- (crosstalk) 

01:44:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:15
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and then, uhm, if they still are not able to name it, it's providing them, uhm, with some, maybe the, the language- 

01:44:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:30
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and sometimes it's surprising people and surprising yourself that maybe it wasn't- 

01:44:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:35
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - what you had thought but that's part of the, the coconstruction- (crosstalk) 

01:44:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:40
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - that is being able to, to understand one another's stories. 

01:44:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:45
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And then we move on to the action stage, after you reflect,- 

01:44:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:50
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER - and what does this mean. You move on into the action stage and that's okay, and where do we go from here? 

01:44:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:44:55
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER And I, when I emphasized that we, because I think that's, the responsibility doesn't end when the session ends. 

01:45:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:45:05
PATRICIA TAIMANGLO PIER Uhm, now did I miss any part of the process that you felt is particularly important? 

01:45:10
