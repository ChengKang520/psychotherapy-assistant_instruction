DANIEL J. ABRAHAMSON, PH.D. This tragedy doesn't allow for denial. It doesn't allow people to say, "Oh, this won't have an effect." In fact, what's the first thing we heard most people saying after this event happened? "This changes everything. Things will never be the same again." 

00:00:40
ANNE C. PRATT, PH. D. In our culture we, uh, we seem to be willing to acknowledge massive traumatic events and terrible grief, sudden grief, when they happen to people, but we don't seem that willing to give it its time. 

00:00:55
RICHARD MOLLICA, M.D. A lot of times as a doctor the best things we can say is, "You know what? What you're really doing is great. Keep on doing it.

LAURIE ANNE PEARLMAN, PH. D. In our, uh, trauma training curriculum, Risking Connection, we suggest that the path to healing is rich relationships. And RICH is an acronym that stands for Respect, Information, Connection, and Hope. And I really believe that those are the four elements that people require in order to move forward through something like a large-scale tragedy or disaster. So, respectful relationships means relationships in which people can speak and be heard, without being judged, or blamed, or shamed, or given advice. Information means it's really important for everyone to have information about what happened, and also about what resources are available, what is the path to healing. Connection means that we have to be brave enough to connect with our own experience, to recognize and acknowledge our own losses, and also courageous enough to connect with one another, one-to-one and across the whole community. And hope, I think, comes about though finding meaning, and trying to find both a way to understand and make sense of what has happened, and a way to create or find meaning for the future. So, I would say that if people can work toward relationships that include these four elements, then there is great hope for healing. Any change that we don't choose is painful. And, so when growth comes about not as a result of something one has decided to do, then, I think, it is painful. And all change involves loss, even when we choose it, even when a person chooses to leave a relationship, or start a new educational path, or leave a job and start a new one. The excitement of the new possibilities is always there, and the loss of what was, of the familiar, of the connections with previous people, that's always there, too. So, I don't know if growth has to be painful, but it certainly involves loss much of the time. And again, if, if it's not something we've chosen, if we're forced into a situation, then I definitely think that king of growth is painful.

ANNE C. PRATT, PH. D. Often, people who have been through something as horrific as that are unwilling to share their experiences with their loved ones or with anyone, even people who ask, partly because they, they know how dreadful and how damaging it is to hold those experiences, to carry that imagery, to know what they know. And they don't wanna inflict that on anybody else. Sometimes when they've tried to talk to somebody else about this, even people who say they want to hear, the response that they get is, um, people listening avidly for a short time and then they find listeners changing the subject or their eyes wandering, or saying, "Wow, that was really bad. I've gotta go now." Uh, that, it's very hard to be a good listener, uh, to someone who has undergone something awful. Even though it's my field and I'm trained in it, I have to watch myself sometimes when the, uh, listening gets tough, I have to silence my urge to change the subject, or to pick up on a side tangent and start responding to that. It's very difficult to, uh, to listen to someone who's gone through something like that. Often, the, uh, the American urge to put it past one and get past it, um, seems to be teaching people to, uh, just process it for a day or two or attend the parade, receive the flowers, um, take in the donations, thank everybody, make a speech and then get on with your life. Put it past you. In our culture today, we're uncomfortable with strong emotion, and people can tolerate it for so long and then they really don't wanna know about it. They wanna distance themselves from it, and, um, certainly people that, people with whom I've worked, who have been traumatized, often complain that, that, um, nobody gets it. That there's an initial outpouring and that very soon after, in a matter of weeks, maybe a month, uh, that disappears and then they feel very alone with their grief. And I think, I think that it's, it's certainly important to return to as much of normal as we can, but I think we rush in our country and I think we rush because we're afraid of strong feelings. Uh, I think we are uncomfortable with them.

DANIEL J. ABRAHAMSON, PH.D. Healing takes time. None of us knows the, the exact time-frame for healing, but we are understanding that for people who have experienced severely traumatizing events, that oftentimes we're talking years not months. If they have past vulnerabilities, previous losses, previous trauma, that it's really important for them to recognize that they're more vulnerable and to reach out and get help. And that's doubly important for people with a previous history of trauma or loss, but it's also true for everybody. We know. There's good, hard science research to show that when people talk about things that are upsetting, they develop less problems as a result of that. They become sick less often, their immune system is strengthened. That, that it's actually it promotes healthy functioning if you talk about what's bothering you on both a physical and emotional level. And of course the physical and emotional, you know, coincide very closely when you're talking about how people react to a trauma. One of the most important memorials or tributes that we can pay to all of the people who died and all of the, the firefighters and police, and emergency personnel who gave up their lives trying to save others, I think the, the, the greatest memorial that we can offer to them as a society is to pay more attention to people's psychological and emotional well-being as an important component of American life. If we have public officials, the president, governors, people in positions of high visibility talking about people being traumatized and talking about people experiencing post-traumatic stress reactions to what happened, we are giving credence to something that those of us on the front lines have known for years, that when people experience a life-altering, sudden traumatic loss, that it can change their life forever, and it can change it in a very negative way, and that one of the ways that we minimize that, the likelihood of that happening is by offering support and validating that, in fact, it was an awful experience and trying to help them make sense of what happened to them, or figure out new ways to cope with, with the limitations they're now experiencing and not disregard those psychological and emotional needs and pretend that the person should be able to just pick themselves up and move on. That attitude has hurt so many people in this country. And if we, out of this, if as employers, and as government institutions, and as healthcare institutions, if we realize and recognize that there will be long-term psychological effects for, for people, particularly for the people who were most closely, uh, touched by this, if that comes out of this then we'll be paying a real tribute to the lives that were lost and the property that was damaged. Um, if, if we end up sort of sweeping it under the carpet and, and pretending that we, we will get back to normal and stop paying attention to the, to the human side of this, once we've, we've cleared away the rubble and rebuilt the buildings, then I think we're gonna be, maybe weaker as a nation, at least emotionally and psychologically.

RICHARD MOLLICA, M.D. The first thing I thought about after, uh, uh, September 11th, in dealing with my own grief, and the grief of those and the sadness of those around me was this, how important this basic idea is that, you know, every person is in need of love affection and support their whole life. It never ends. For people who are so devastated, you know, by the violence, um, there's always one small little spot of joy that you have to find as a clinician. The initial response in seeing horrible things is to respond to be compassionate, and then the backlash is to say, "Eh, I've had enough, you know, I..." And this is also true with providers and clinicians, you know. They can only take so much and then they just say, "Look, it's, uh, this is too much, you know." So you need, you need to have a, uh, a broader, more holistic approach that, that also, uh, brings the joy and the positive aspects out, you know. You could have a whole field in uh, in working with survivors of, uh, extreme situations like New York that's just based on resiliency. You could take the whole field, turn it around. It's just the field called, uh, resiliency field. Instead of the way it's done now, which is to start out with pathology and with, uh, with the deficit model. Damage, injury, pathology, upset, diagnosis, you know, of course that's all important, but, but, you, it depends. Is the cup half-full? Is the cup half empty? You know. A lot of times as a doctor the best things we can say is, "You know what? What you're really doing is great. Keep on doing it. You know. Your having, spending more time with your mother. That's great. You know. You, you, you're spending more time with the family. That's great. You know. You're, uh, making a donation to... That's great. You know. In other words, give people the message that they have the capacity within themselves to heal themselves and to heal others.

FRANK PUTNAM, M.D. There's a lot of trauma in our society that has not been really looked at. We, we know now, that sort of, nine percent of Americans have a lifetime history of PTSD at some point or another in their life. That's a lot of people when we think about, uh, the resources we put in the many disorders that have one or two percent of the population affected. And we haven't paid enough attention to the chronic violence that kids in the inner city are exposed to, and the fact, that there are millions of child-abuse cases every year in this country or those kinds of trauma, not to mention the hurricanes, and tornadoes, and other kinds of natural disasters. We don't have a sufficient capacity, I think, as a country for treatment of trauma and, uh, that's what I would like to see, you know, us take these events and where there has been an awareness of, of trauma that has not existed, sort of, here before at these levels. And to use this as an opportunity to build, uh, better treatment facilities and infrastructure and information. That should be one of the legacies is that we're better prepared to, uh, work with trauma in our society because the chances are we're gonna see other events and we really need to have better, really, resources and treatment available for all the sources of trauma. And it will make a better society. If we treat trauma there's, sort of, violence begets violence. And, uh, if we can break that cycle by treating people, uh, particularly children who are exposed to this, we will make large contributions to the future. 

00:14:05
LAURIE ANNE PEARLMAN, PH. D. I think hope involves being able to take in the realities of the world and maintain a sense of future and possibility. I don't think we need tragedy for that, but we do need commitment. And, um, commitment is not easy to come by. Um, tragedy makes hope a necessity. Uh, but I think there is the possibility of living a life committed to hope.
