Introduction with Sheri Bauman, Ph.D. And Sam Steen, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
SHERI BAUMAN Hi everyone. I'm Sheri Bauman. I'm at the University of Arizona. 

00:00:10
SAM STEEN And my name is Sam Steen and I'm currently at George Washington University. 

00:00:15
SHERI BAUMAN And we are fortunate to have another opportunity to work together, this time with a group of 8th graders. 

00:00:20
SAM STEEN Right. This is our second video and the first time we did this video was three years ago. We just discussed that. And we did it with 5th graders. It was a cross cultural group with 5th graders. This one is, uh, a group of 8th graders and some of the topics of discussion center around transition to high school, dealing with family issues, and we also wanted to infuse race and ethnicity and culture and diversity more broadly speaking as well: gender, maybe religion, socioeconomic status, if those things come up. 

00:00:55
SHERI BAUMAN We have made the same decision that we made in the first video, which is to, um, not edit the, the sessions other than if there are periods where everybody's drawing and so forth because, chances are, uh, that we're gonna make a few mistakes and we hope that those mistakes are just as instructive as the things we do well because they give you a chance to look and decide how you might have handled those situations differently or better. 

00:01:25
SAM STEEN Some of the other developmental things to consider include, like, with our 5th graders, we had tons of activities and what we're finding, what we know this time, what we assume this time is that with older kids, maybe we should try to use less activities and, um, be sure to use more talk therapy if you will. You know, give them the opportunity to explore these issues more verbally because they are older and so they should be able to do that. 

00:01:50
SHERI BAUMAN And, and even the activities we use are really prompts to, uh, encourage that interaction that we're looking for rather than, you know, the, the lesson being the activity. 

00:02:00
SAM STEEN Exactly. 

00:02:00
SHERI BAUMAN So, so they're, were fewer but they're also different and then, um, we're able to, to talk about a lot more, um, sensitive issues, to have more depth to the discussion and we're able to, um, manage topics that just probably would not be appropriate for the younger students. 

00:02:20
SAM STEEN And we also notice or believe this time we should be able to spend more time in session. Uh, with younger kids, you wanna keep it short, 20, 30 minutes. Thirty-five minutes at the most but we assume with the older kids that we can spend a little bit more time. So some of the sessions may be 40, 45 minutes, um, maybe even 50 minutes to some extent but because they are older, we believe that they should be able to handle that. 

00:02:50
SHERI BAUMAN And require it because there's so much more interaction. The other thing we wanna, um, note, last, when we did the group of 5th graders, they all came from the same school, so even though they weren't close friends, they did have some previous contact with each other. In this case, two of the students know each other but the rest are meeting for the first time. Um, meeting us and meeting each other. So, um, I think that creates a different dynamic and it's, um, will be an opportunity explore how that works. 

00:03:20
SAM STEEN Um, we're fortunate that again to, because we've co-facilitated a group together in the past that we have some experience doing this. Uh, Sheri and I have been friends for quite some time but we've only co-facilitated a group the last time we did the video. So again we get the opportunity to co-facilitate a group and some of the things that we wanna be mindful of is to ensure that we don't sit next to each other. Obviously we didn't talk about dress so we, we'll try to make sure we're not wearing the same color. That was not intentional. It was definitely, you know, by default. Um, but to not sit next to each other, to try to read each other's body language, to try to feed off of each other, and to explore our co-facilitation and/or styles either through, between each session or, you know, at the end of a session. 

00:04:05
SHERI BAUMAN And sometimes within a session because I think we want to model being able to challenge or, um, resolve a difference in an appropriate way within the group. 

00:04:15
SAM STEEN Absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:04:20
SHERI BAUMAN And, speaking of processing, we're gonna try to process every session or two. Um, that's important for our planning and to make sure that we're checking in with each other. Perhaps something struck you that doesn't strike me or the other. Um, so hopefully we'll be able to do that and we'll film whatever we do. 

00:04:40
SAM STEEN It's a good point because, with the older kids, um, we hope to be able to take a little bit more time in, to really follow their lead rather than having these preconceived notions of how things are gonna unfold. So, anything else you'd like to add? 

00:04:55
SHERI BAUMAN I don't think so. I think we just wanna say that we hope this video is valuable to people either learning or feeling like they need to reinforce their skills, uh, in group counseling, which is something we both believe is very valuable. 

00:05:10
Information Session with group 

00:05:15
[music] 

00:05:15
SHERI BAUMAN What we're gonna do first, before we really start is if we had done this right, we would have had a chance to meet with each of you beforehand to tell you about the group and kinda what you were agreeing to and give you a chance to ask questions. So I wanna do that now, even though you already agreed, just to make sure we're all on the same page and that, um, you have, you have a chance to ask questions after I do that and then I'll give you the sheet I would have given you when we met at the end, just to have. Is that a deal? Is that okay? 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:06:00
SHERI BAUMAN So, uh, at this point, um, we haven't met and, but you agreed or that you're at least thinking about being part of a, of a group. So what's a group for anyway? And I'm gonna answer that for you, just so that you know. Um, it can be, different groups are, have different ways of doing it. Some groups, like, might be for a specific group of, or specific issue, like, let's say children of, of divorced families or, um, what's another possible topic? 

00:06:35
SAM STEEN Maybe anger management. 

00:06:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. And other groups are more just open for people to learn abut themselves and others and have a chance to grow, which is more like this group in many ways and what typically happens is that we find ourselves talking about common concerns or problems, things that, 'cuz you're all the same age and you live in the same area, so there are probably some things that are important to all of you and it's a chance to express your feelings in a safe place where, if you, um, nobody's gonna laugh at you or, um, you know, humiliate you or embarrass you. It's also, the neat thing about groups, I think, is to help you understand how other people react to you and how they think of you. Some of you, a couple of you know each other but most of you didn't know each other before you got here today and it's interesting to find out how other people respond to you when they first meet you and as they get to know you, how that changes and so you learn more about yourself as a part of this process, hopefully. That you'll leave just a little more self-aware than you got here. So we're gonna be meeting eight sessions that would ordinarily be once a week but we're gonna do them all in two days, with little breaks and there are obviously two counselors. Um, I'm Sheri Bauman and this is Sam Steen, my friend and colleague and partner in crime and all those things and then there are five other 8th graders so all, the one thing you all have in common is that you're all 8th graders and you're all from this general area. So some, uh, things that you might feel at the end, hopefully, is that you understand other people in the group that you didn't know, who are maybe different from you in a new way and that may help you understand yourself or think or yourself differently. Um, I hope that all of us will learn more about our strengths, what other people see as our strong characteristics or attributes, um, that we can then use in our life and sometimes we feel like nobody else would possibly understand this and then in a group sometimes, you find, wow, someone really did. There's, and, and maybe someone that you would never guess. So hopefully that'll happen too while we're here. We'll find out that we're not alone and that there are others who share some of the things that we worry about. So what we are expect, you know what to expect from us. We're gonna, um, be here. We're gonna be on time. We're gonna provide some refreshments. Um, we're gonna do our job and make sure everybody's safe in the group and we'd like you to, first of all, be willing to be honest so that might mean, uh, you don't like something that we say or that, um, something is uncomfortable and also to be willing to take some risks. So that is sometimes, something can be a little uncomfortable but it's really, if you can push yourself to do it, then, or say it or think it, then you have a chance to grow. That's where our growth place is. And definitely be willing to listen to other people and to respond to them. So if, um, like right now, I'm wondering what you're thinking of me. You never saw me before or some of you did but you don't remember. Um, you know, I might wanna say, what do you think of me now? And that would be a chance where, in other words, you, if I asked you tell me your deepest, darkest secret, you certainly I hope are gonna say I'm not telling you that. That's none of your business but if I ask you Tyler, what do you think of what I just said? I, I was a little embarrassed. Then it's not okay to say I don't wanna tell because it's really not for you. It's for someone else. Does that make sense? So, very cool. Any questions for me or for Sam? So this would be our information session before we really start and if you had questions, um, we would certainly try to answer those and then we would say our first meeting will be on Saturday at such and such a time and we'll see you then. 

00:11:10
SAM STEEN I would say the only other thing you didn't add, you talked about the different types of groups but by any chance, um, do you all know what type of group this might be? Or, so far, what do you imagine this type of group, being like the topic? She gave examples. Anger management. Do you think this is a group about anger management? 

00:11:30
UNKOWN No. 

00:11:30
SAM STEEN Probably not anger management. We also talked about people's, you know, changing families. Maybe family dynamics. Not specifically about this group, you know, related to family issues or concerns but what do you think, so far, this group might be potentially be about based on the things that we've sent to you or that maybe your parents have told you? 

00:11:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I know where you're going but I wanna say one other thing. You're all 8th graders and that's kind of a, um, an important time. I mean, you're getting ready to move on to high school, where you have to think about the rest of your life and you have to make decisions and you have to make plans. So, um, one thing that might come up is just what it's like to be at this age and at this point in your life. So that's one topic of transitions that we mentioned in the, in the material. 

00:12:25
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Absolutely. But you were saying you know where I'm going. You didn't necessarily know where, where do you think I was going? Go on. You can answer the question first or you can, either one. 

00:12:40
SHERI BAUMAN No, I want them to answer. I've been talking too much. Just go. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN What was the question? 

00:12:45
SAM STEEN The topic. What do you think the topic of these, these eight sessions will be? One may be transition. One being in 8th grade. 

00:12:50
BRIANNA Life. 

00:12:50
SAM STEEN Maybe life in general. 

00:12:55
TYLER School. 

00:12:55
SAM STEEN Things about school. 

00:12:55
JUSTIN Being at home with your family. 

00:13:00
SAM STEEN Maybe being, like how you interact with your family or how you feel about being in that, part of that family. 

00:13:05
TAHLIA Hobbies. 

00:13:05
SAM STEEN Things you're interested in. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Social life. 

00:13:05
SAM STEEN Social life, yeah. 

00:13:10
TYLER Growing up. 

00:13:10
SAM STEEN You say girls? 

00:13:10
TYLER Growing up. 

00:13:15
SAM STEEN Oh. 

00:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN You can tell what's on his mind. 

00:13:15
SAM STEEN I thought you said girls. Yeah, all of that. And we'll see what else emerges along the way. One thing that we talked about, which is what Sheri was saying, I know, I knew what you were saying Sheri, was that we also, um, decided that we would talk about culture and diversity issues related to diversity or race, ethnicity and culture and in that, in those conversations, it's not just, you know, black or white or Latino or Hispanic but also maybe religion or maybe gender, right? Being a boy or a girl and things of that nature. So that's also a part of the topic that we want to infuse throughout the conversation. 

00:13:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay? Well, we will see you all right here. 

00:14:00
SAM STEEN Next week. 

00:14:00
SHERI BAUMAN Next week. 

00:14:05
SAM STEEN Are you coming back? 

00:14:10
JUSTIN Yes. 

00:14:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah? Everybody coming back? Okay. 

00:14:10
End of Information Session with group 

00:14:15
[sil.] 

00:14:15
Session 1 Part 1 

00:14:25
[music] 

00:14:25
SAM STEEN All right, good afternoon boys and girls or should I call you young men and young women? Which one would you prefer? 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN Boys and girls. 

00:14:30
SAM STEEN Boys and girls. You still wanna be a little girl? There's nothing wrong with that. So welcome back. This is session number one. It's good to see you all and the first thing we like to do is just to really get to know your names better. Um, we've met kind of on one occasion but I just wanna make sure that we have everybody's name down and it gives you an opportunity to learn each other's names a little bit better. So what we'd like for you to do is just tell us your name and then maybe share something about, that you know of, about how you got that name. So maybe discuss something about how you got that name. Or, and/or, tell us what would your name be if you were the opposite sex. 

00:15:10
SHERI BAUMAN If you know. 

00:15:10
SAM STEEN If you know. 

00:15:10
SHERI BAUMAN I, unfortunately, know. 

00:15:15
SAM STEEN Right. If you, you know too as well? Right, so if you know. If you don't know, maybe if you want to imagine what you would want your name to be if you were of the opposite sex, that's fair. And then last thing at this point is, do you like your name and if so, you know, why is it, and if not, why not? And lastly, what a nick, what we can call you. So like I know for one of you, you go by your shorter name, so you can, you know, just tell us what you prefer to be called. So anybody can start. I prefer not to start because I don't really know, I don't know how to answer these questions yet, so... 

00:15:50
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, well I can start. 

00:15:50
SAM STEEN Okay. 

00:15:50
SHERI BAUMAN All right. You have to coach me though. 

00:15:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Okay, in terms of what? 

00:15:50
SHERI BAUMAN If I don't remember all the things. 

00:15:55
SAM STEEN Sure. Absolutely. 

00:15:55
SHERI BAUMAN So my name is Sheri and actually, it's Sheri Ann and some people think it's Sheri Ann and some people think it's Sheri but I've always used Sheri and I was named for my grandmother on my mother's side. She had died long before I was born and my mother wanted to name me in honor of her and I'm so glad that I was girl because if I was a boy, my name would have been Stanley, which is not my favorite name. So, and I kinda like Sheri but in my generation, that was a very, very common name and I wish I had maybe a more original name, like Elena. 

00:16:40
SAM STEEN So do you like it or? 

00:16:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, it's okay. I'm used to it after all these years. 

00:16:45
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Okay. And you prefer to be called Sheri? 

00:16:50
SHERI BAUMAN I prefer to be called Sheri, yes. Thank you. 

00:16:50
SAM STEEN Anybody else? 

00:16:50
TYLER I'll go. Oh, you go. 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN You go. 

00:16:55
TYLER Okay, I'll go. Um, my name's Tyler. Um, I, I don't know why my parents picked that name. I, I guess they just liked it. Uh, if I were a girl, I'd probably be named Taylor, 'cuz it's like the closest thing to Tyler and, uh, that's it. 

00:17:15
SAM STEEN So Taylor would probably be the name if you were a girl. 

00:17:20
TYLER Yeah. 

00:17:20
SHERI BAUMAN Do you like it? Do you like your name? 

00:17:20
TYLER Yeah, I like my name. It's nice. 

00:17:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, 'cuz you know what? Names are like the first thing, very often, besides your appearance that we learn and it's kind of a handle that we carry around our whole life, so. 

00:17:30
SAM STEEN Is there any nickname that you go by? 

00:17:35
TYLER Not really, no. Just Tyler. 

00:17:40
SAM STEEN Tyler. Okay. Thanks Tyler. 

00:17:40

00:17:50
JUSTIN Um, my name is Justin. Um, my dad said they picked that name out of a big book randomly, I guess. 

00:18:00
SHERI BAUMAN Like. 

00:18:00
JUSTIN Yeah, but I know, um, my middle name, I was named after my dad's father, um, Bernard and, um, if I was a girl, my name would probably be Jasmine, just close. It's kinda close to Justin but yeah. That's about it. 

00:18:15
SAM STEEN Do you like your name? 

00:18:15
JUSTIN Yeah, it's all right. Yeah, I like Justin. 

00:18:15
SAM STEEN Do you? 

00:18:15
JUSTIN Yeah. 

00:18:15
SAM STEEN You like it? I can tell. 

00:18:15
JUSTIN But if I, if I had to choose a name, I'd probably choose Trey. I like that name. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN Trey Songz. 

00:18:25

00:19:00

ALEJANDRA Yeah. It's a good name. It's the god of fire. Um. 

00:19:15
SAM STEEN Hold on. Had you thought about that before you came here. Like? 

00:19:15
ALEJANDRA No. I'm fascinated by Greek mythology so I know lots of gods. I'll probably name my child that if I have a boy. 

00:19:25
SAM STEEN Yeah? Prometheus? 

00:19:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Um. 

00:19:30
SAM STEEN That's cool. 

00:19:30

00:19:35
SAM STEEN Can you handle that? Ale? Is that right? 

00:19:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:19:40
SAM STEEN Close? And do you like your name? 

00:19:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I guess. Yeah. 

00:19:50
SAM STEEN A little bit? Okay, thanks Ale. 

00:19:55
BRIANNA My name's, uh, Brianna and I'm called Bri because it's easier to say and I have the same middle name and, as my mom, which is Lynn and I was named after, uh, after my nana who passed away, uh, four years ago and if I was a boy, my mom said that she would have called me Caden. I don't know why. 

00:20:25
SHERI BAUMAN Do you like your name? 

00:20:30
BRIANNA Yeah. 

00:20:30
SAM STEEN Were you close to your grandma? Or your nana, you said? 

00:20:35
BRIANNA Uh, she raised me when my parents were divorcing. 

00:20:40
SAM STEEN Oh really? 

00:20:40
BRIANNA So. 

00:20:40
SAM STEEN So you were close. 

00:20:40
BRIANNA I, uh, lived with her pretty much. 

00:20:40
SAM STEEN And the boy name again, Caden? 

00:20:45
BRIANNA Yeah. I don't know why. 

00:20:45
SAM STEEN You're not sure why? 

00:20:45
BRIANNA But they also call me by my nickname, which is really embarrassing. They say it when I'm playing softball so now my coaches call me Pork Chop. 

00:20:55
SHERI BAUMAN Oh dear. 

00:20:55
BRIANNA Or actually my coach calls me, my coach called me Chopper. 

00:21:00
SAM STEEN Pork Chop? 

00:21:00
BRIANNA Yeah. 

00:21:00
SAM STEEN Or Chopper. And can you tell us maybe where that came from? 

00:21:05
BRIANNA 'Cuz I taught my mom how to cook pork chops, so they just called me, I don't know. 

00:21:15
SAM STEEN Do you like pork chops? 

00:21:15
BRIANNA No. 

00:21:15
SAM STEEN Not really. Wow. So. 

00:21:20
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) So, yeah. 

00:21:20
SAM STEEN So do we call you Chopper, Pork Chop, or should we stick with Bri? 

00:21:25
BRIANNA I don't care. Chopper is better than Pork Chop, so. 

00:21:25
SHERI BAUMAN Is Bri okay for... 

00:21:30
BRIANNA Yeah, that's fine. 

00:21:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:21:30
SAM STEEN It might slip. Pork Chop. Anybody else (inaudible ). Got a couple more. 

00:21:38
TYLER My name's Tyler. Um, I don't know why my parents chose that name. I have never heard of it. Like I meet very few people. He's one of the very few people I've met. Um, I'm fine with my name but I like my last name better, so my friends call me Stiltner (ph). 

00:21:55
SAM STEEN Stiltner? 

00:21:55
TYLER I like that. Stitlner. So that's what they call me by. 

00:22:00
SHERI BAUMAN You know, that's interesting. I was just thinking that men get, you, the whole shebang, you get to keep for your whole life. Like it's real unusual for a man to change his last name but the female's get a choice anyway, if you chose to marry and then you still have a choice of whether you take your partner's. 

00:22:20
JUSTIN My friends and I, there was a movie that really emphasized that. It was called Saving Private Ryan. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN I know that movie. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Oh, I wanna see that movie so bad. 

00:22:30
JUSTIN Yeah. (inaudible ) military and there's only like two of 'em left and they had to go and get him, save the family name. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:35
SAM STEEN To save the family name. 

00:22:35
BRIANNA If I get married to someone, a guy who has a name of like, a last name that starts with T, my initials would be, will be BLT. 

00:22:45
SAM STEEN Are you gonna look for that person? 

00:22:50
BRIANNA No. 

00:22:50
SAM STEEN Not necessarily. So her names are Pork Chop and BLT. That's a lot of pork. But Stiffler. Is it Stiffler or? 

00:22:55
TYLER No, Stiltner. 

00:23:00
SAM STEEN Stiltner. When you said Stiffler, it reminded me of a movie, I can't remember the name of it. 

00:23:00
JUSTIN Oh, um, is that the new Bad News Bears? 

00:23:05
SAM STEEN I'm not really sure where I heard it. 

00:23:10
SHERI BAUMAN Are you like the movie expert? Is that your deal? 

00:23:10
JUSTIN No. I don't even watch movies. That's interesting though. 

00:23:10
SAM STEEN Yeah. But it's... 

00:23:15
TYLER Stiltner. 

00:23:15
SAM STEEN Stiltner, right. I sounds like you're already in college. You know when you go to college, they start to calling you by your last name. 

00:23:20
TYLER Yeah, that's what everybody says. 

00:23:20
SAM STEEN Stiltner. 

00:23:20
BRIANNA My teachers call me by my last name? 

00:23:25
SAM STEEN Do they? 

00:23:25
BRIANNA But they say it wrong. They call me Barrios (ph) and I don't know where they get the I in my last name. 

00:23:30
SAM STEEN And your last name is? 

00:23:30
BRIANNA Barros. 

00:23:30
SAM STEEN Barros. 

00:23:30
BRIANNA There's no I. 

00:23:35
SHERI BAUMAN That's really interesting. 

00:23:35
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Barrios. 

00:23:35
SHERI BAUMAN I'm gonna as you something about that. Do you correct them? 

00:23:35
BRIANNA Well, no. 

00:23:40
SHERI BAUMAN Because my last, well, it's, I took my husband's... 

00:23:45
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Well, well, well, but ask her why, what, or go ahead. 

00:23:45
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I'll explain and then I'll ask her. My last name, which is my husband's name, I took his name, is Bauman. That's how we say it. And I'll introduce myself and say Hi. I'm Sheri Bauman and someone turns around and says um, here's Mrs. Bowman. All the time. 

00:24:00
JUSTIN Ball? 

00:24:00
SAM STEEN Bow. 

00:24:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, they mispronounce it and sometimes I, I correct them and other times, I feel annoyed and I don't even wanna bother. So I wondered if you had that feeling when people mess up your name. 

00:24:15
BRIANNA No, it's just funny because they mess it, mess it up all the time. So I just start laughing and he's like, he's Hispanic and I'm Hispanic too, so he should know how to say it, but he still says Barrios. 

00:24:25
SAM STEEN That was the first thing that came to my mind. What, was it a person, was it, you know, I was gonna say was the person, was the teacher white and you're saying no, he's Hispanic. 

00:24:35
BRIANNA He's Hispanic. I think he does it on purpose because he knows it annoy me. 

00:24:35
SAM STEEN Oh, okay. He's just teasing you. 

00:24:40
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Ah. 

00:24:40
SAM STEEN Barrios. 

00:24:40
SHERI BAUMAN So I think we have somebody left, eh? 

00:24:45
TAHLIA Oh, okay. My name is Tahlia my dad wanted that name so, so they, they named me that but they put the H after the A because they didn't know where the H went so it's T-A-H-L-I-A instead of T-H-A-L-I-A. 

00:25:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, I didn't know that. 

00:25:10
SAM STEEN Do you think that trips people up? Like it confuses them when they see it? 

00:25:15
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Yeah they. Yeah, they say oh, I thought it was spelled this way. 

00:25:15
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. 

00:25:15
SHERI BAUMAN It's an unusual name. Do you like having that name? 

00:25:20
TAHLIA Yes. 

00:25:20
SAM STEEN Because? 

00:25:25
TAHLIA Because it's, I don't know, it's different. But my mom was gonna name me, like, I done forgot. It was like, Juliane or something like that. I don't know. 

00:25:40
SHERI BAUMAN And you prefer what you got? 

00:25:40
TAHLIA Yeah. 

00:25:40
SAM STEEN So your, your dad won out with that sort of discussion. 

00:25:45
TAHLIA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:45
SAM STEEN And if you were a young man or a little boy, what would you be called? Do you know? 

00:25:50
TAHLIA No. I don't know. 

00:25:55
SAM STEEN What's your middle name? 

00:25:55
TAHLIA Um, Delores. It's from my grandma's name but she died, you know. 

00:26:05
SHERI BAUMAN So several of us have names from deceased or important relatives. 

00:26:10
TAHLIA Well, she was alive when they named me that. 

00:26:10
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, she was? 

00:26:10
TAHLIA Yeah. 

00:26:10
SHERI BAUMAN So was she important to, to them or to you? 

00:26:15
TAHLIA Yeah. It was my dad's mom. 

00:26:20
SHERI BAUMAN So it seems to me we've heard from everybody but Sam. Am I right? I think so. 

00:26:25
SAM STEEN I can go. So my name is Sam and I have an older brother. His name is Steve but my dad's name is Sam so I'm a junior, right? But normally the junior is the first born. You know what I'm saying? Like, should have been, you know, my older brother should have been named Sam and then I should have been something else. So I asked my mom what happened, like, where'd that come from and she said that when your brother was born, your dad wasn't here, meaning he was in the military. He wasn't, they weren't married. So she didn't want to name him Sam, like this man and have to look at him and everyday call him this name that is no longer in her life, if that makes any sense. So then they got together, they got married, they had another child, and it was me and so now I'm Sam and I kinda like the name but I really don't like, I like the name Sam but my real name is Sammy. S-A-M-M-Y. Not Samuel, not Sampson. Sammy. You know? And I'm not that tall so people look at me like little Sammy or whatever. So I don't, so I go by Sam. That's really how, so that's where the name came from. Should have been something else. What would it be if it were the, the other sex. I have no idea. I actually know that my dad didn't want another boy. He, 'cuz he said their greedy, right and they were dirt poor, so he said he wanted another, a little girl. They don't eat as much but, it's a true story. It's a true story. And, um, but they got another little boy and he happened to be a runt. So my dad's 6 feet tall and my brother's 6 feet tall and then you have me. I'm like 5'6" and three-fourth or something like that. Do I like my name? I already told you. If it were Samuel, I would love my name. Samuel comes from the Bible. It's very, like, strong. It means, like, wisdom and all these other things, but it's Sammy, so. 

00:28:15
TYLER Sammy Sosa. 

00:28:15
SAM STEEN Sammy Sosa? Yeah. But isn't he a criminal? Like didn't they say he... 

00:28:20
TYLER Yeah. 

00:28:20
SAM STEEN I don't wanna be associated with a criminal. No, I'm just kidding. And, um, that's it. So I prefer to be called Sam and if anybody calls me Sammy then we'll have a discussion outside in the hallway. And lastly, can you remember everybody's name and maybe something about that person that you learned? Just anything that they shared? Wanna try it? 

00:28:45
BRIANNA No. I have a bad memory. 

00:28:45
SAM STEEN You have a bad memory? Somebody that try, try it. 

00:28:50
TAHLIA Okay. Okay, Sheri but she'd rather be named Elena and then Justin and that his dad picked his name out of the random and then Alejandra, um, if she was a boy, she would be named Prometheus. 

00:29:10
ALEJANDRA If I had to choose. 

00:29:15
TAHLIA And then Sam and he'd rather be named Samuel instead of Sammy and then Tyler and he said his name's okay and then Brianna, she likes to call, be called Bri and, and then Tyler and he likes his name. 

00:29:35
SAM STEEN Yeah, good job. 

00:29:35
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I'm glad we did that because I think names are real important and now we can refer to each other by name instead of, you know, pointing to someone. So good job. 

00:29:50
SAM STEEN So the other thing is that last, um, time we met, we talked about norms or we call them ground rules or things that we want you to consider when we interact with each other. Do you remember any of those? Sheri began to tell you some of them like maybe listening to each other. You remember that? What else did we talk about? 

00:30:10
ALEJANDRA Wasn't it about, like, the groups or something? 

00:30:10
SAM STEEN Yeah, exactly. What about it? Go ahead, Justin. 

00:30:15
JUSTIN Don't humiliate each other. Be honest. 

00:30:15
SAM STEEN Be honest. Don't humiliate each other. Absolutely. Anything else? 

00:30:20
TYLER Ooh, don't be afraid to take a chance, like with saying stuff. 

00:30:25
SAM STEEN Yeah, that's good Tyler. Don't be afraid to take a risk and say it. If it crosses your mind like Prometheus, I'm sorry, Alejandra said, then just say it, right? Just say it. Anything else? 

00:30:35
TAHLIA Um, like about personal, person. 

00:30:35
SAM STEEN What do you mean? 

00:30:40
TAHLIA That she said if you ask like what's your deepest, darkest secret, that you shouldn't expect to get an answer back. 

00:30:50
SAM STEEN That's a choice you have. You can share if you want. You don't have to. 

00:30:55
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:30:55
SAM STEEN But if someone asks you something else, right? 

00:31:00
TAHLIA Yeah. 

00:31:00
SAM STEEN Like what? 

00:31:00
TAHLIA I don't know. 

00:31:00
SAM STEEN You don't remember? Do you remember? How she said it? 

00:31:05
TYLER Oh. Like something about like did I just say something embarrassing, like you can say that or something like that. 

00:31:10
SAM STEEN Yeah, like if we ask you for feedback. 

00:31:10
TYLER Yeah. 

00:31:15
SAM STEEN Right. So tell me what, you know, when we did that activity, what was that like or did I talk too much or did I cut you off, you know, and if so, I apologize or something like that and you can tell me how you felt about that. That's giving a person feedback. So the only other thing that we left out was confidentiality. Are you familiar with that one? 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:30
SAM STEEN Confidentiality. In, in your words, what do you think that means? 

00:31:35
JUSTIN Keeping it inside the group. 

00:31:35
SAM STEEN That's exactly right. So what we talk about stays in here. Now, we recognize there are three or four cameras here and that people all over the country or world may see it, but remember most of your friends won't, none of your friends will probably see it. Your parents probably won't take the time to actually watch it. Um, so you, you can feel very comfortable about what you talk about literally stays in this room and, um, with the exception of if it's something that you say that's harmful, you know, we would have to share that to make sure you get that sort of help. Doing harm to yourself or someone else. 

00:32:10
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) So... 

00:32:10
SAM STEEN Yes? 

00:32:10
ALEJANDRA So like that saying, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas? 

00:32:15
SAM STEEN Absolutely. This can be Vegas for seven or eight sessions. That's fine. To some extent. 'Cuz there's some pretty gnarly things that go on in Vegas. That's what I heard. 

00:32:25
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:32:25
ALEJANDRA Never been to Vegas? 

00:32:25
SAM STEEN I was a 4 year old. My parents left us in the hotel room while they went out doing whatever they do in Vegas. 

00:32:35
SHERI BAUMAN 'Cuz they left it in Vegas, so you don't know, right? 

00:32:35
SAM STEEN Exactly. So yeah, that was it. The confidentiality and the last thing was have fun. You know, try to have fun when you're doing it. Just try to have fun. 

00:32:45
SHERI BAUMAN Thanks. We thought it would be a good idea in this first session to do like the names and things to help us get comfortable with each other and know a little bit more each other, about each other. So if Stiltner would reach behind you, um, there are some, like, drawing pads on the bottom of that and if we each got one of those and some writing implements. There's crayons and markers and stuff over there. You're not an artist? 

00:33:15
ALEJANDRA She's an artist. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN I'm not. 

00:33:20
SAM STEEN Art is never wrong. 

00:33:20
SHERI BAUMAN Well, wait until you see mine and then you won't be embarrassed. 

00:33:25
TYLER Are, are we actually gonna be like drawing or something? 

00:33:25
SHERI BAUMAN Uh-huh. 

00:33:25
TYLER Oh, wow. 

00:33:25
SHERI BAUMAN But not a picture, like. 

00:33:25
TYLER Okay, good. 

00:33:25
BRIANNA (crosstalk) Who's that? 

00:33:25
TYLER 'Cuz I can't draw. 

00:33:30
SHERI BAUMAN That is Rembrandt. He is a very famous artist. 

00:33:30
BRIANNA Never heard of him. 

00:33:35
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you can tell from his clothing that it's been a few hundred years since he's been around. 

00:33:40
SAM STEEN (crosstalk inaudible ). Take this one. 

00:33:41
SHERI BAUMAN So. 

00:33:41
JUSTIN I can't draw. 

00:33:41
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you won't have to. 

00:33:41
TYLER Neither can I, so. 

00:33:45
SHERI BAUMAN Mine isn't drawing. Um, this is not an art activity and it's not a, um, why don't we put those where maybe everybody can reach. There's some more. But what we're gonna do is make a, um, an unusual kind, or, (inaudible ) but a name tag that's more than just a name and Bri, right behind you, there's kind of a, a big piece of drawing paper. And I did this as a model, so once you see this, you won't worry about your drawing. Okay? So I'll give you the instructions and then ask each of you to take a few minutes to do it. So your name goes in the middle, however you want it and it, if you'd like to, like if you think of yourself as short, you could make your name this tall or if you, if you can make it. You know, so if there's some way that you wanna, uh, make your name represent you, feel free to try that. I bet you can't tell what I'm trying to show on my name. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN Christmas? You like Christmas ornaments. 

00:34:45
SHERI BAUMAN That's what I was afraid of. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN You like earrings? 

00:34:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yes, I love earrings and jewelry. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Earrings. I was gonna say earrings. 

00:34:50
SHERI BAUMAN So I was putting them on there. Yeah, this is a ring and so forth. So that was my little feeble attempt to do that, okay? So and then in the upper right hand corner, in this corner, we'd like you to either draw or write the names of some places that you have good memories of. And it could be your room. It could be, you know, a place you went on a vacation. Any place, in other words, that you have some nice memories of being at. In this corner, you're gonna put the names of some people who, um, have made a, that you admire or look up to and they can be people that you know personally or people that are famous or people that are, you know, if you're an art student, you might put Rembrandt even though he died probably three or 400 years ago. So anybody that had an impact on you and down here, you're gonna put your talents or skills or abilities. Um, anything you're good at. And then up here is some things you wanna do in your life. Some things you're hoping to accomplish or do or be, why are you laughing? Oh, can you see mine? I'm, I'm not sharing yet. Which one? 

00:36:15
JUSTIN Exercise at night. 

00:36:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. I saw a lady that, um, competes in like, um, you know, weight lifting things, you know, in her 80's. 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:36:25
SHERI BAUMAN I wanna do it when I'm 90. 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN That's crazy. 

00:36:30
SHERI BAUMAN Now chances are, I can do real well right? Because there probably won't be a lot of competition in my weight class but that's a, I mean, I wanna stay in real active. So you see, it can be from that to anything. So name in the middle, places corner, people corner, skills corner, and hopes, you know, and dreams or and so if you'll each do one of those. 

00:36:55
SAM STEEN Did you have a question Alejandra? 

00:36:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah, is the Michelle Obama? 

00:37:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:37:00
ALEJANDRA Oh, why do you admire her? 

00:37:00
SHERI BAUMAN Um, a, 'cuz she's really smart. B, 'cuz she's really classy to me in the way she dresses and the way she presents herself. Um, have you ever seen that video of her dancing? 

00:37:15
ALEJANDRA No. 

00:37:15
SHERI BAUMAN I love that. She's dancing with kids, the Dougie and stuff. 

00:37:20
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Oh, the Dougie? 

00:37:20
SHERI BAUMAN Um, and so she's willing to take a risk and she, she believes in kids and she believes in keeping kids healthy, which is why she's doing all this dancing and stuff to get kids active. So I didn't really want to share my whole thing, but should I? 

00:37:35
SAM STEEN Well, she asked you. Why not? 

00:37:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, so should I do the whole thing? 

00:37:35
SAM STEEN No, I would say go ahead and let's get started. 

00:37:40
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Okay. Well, yeah. Let's do that and then, and then you'll doing exactly what we want to do is as, as people share things, we might wanna know a little bit about it. So the good news is mine, already done. 

00:37:55
TAHLIA I think those are stamps. 

00:37:55
SHERI BAUMAN Excuse me? 

00:37:55
JUSTIN Oh yeah, these are stamps. 

00:37:55
SHERI BAUMAN They're what? 

00:38:00
JUSTIN They're stamps. 

00:38:00
SHERI BAUMAN What's a stamp? 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Rubber stamps. 

00:38:00
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk inaudible ). Oh, I get it. Sorry. Do we have enough real things? We can always share. 

00:38:05
SAM STEEN Yeah, there's plenty. 

00:38:10
BRIANNA You dropped markers on the floor. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:38:10
SHERI BAUMAN And that's fine. 

00:38:15
SAM STEEN In case you wouldn't know. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN What? 

00:38:15
TAHLIA You go get the marker. 

00:38:15
SHERI BAUMAN I had some pastels but they're such a mess I thought you'd be (inaudible ). 

00:38:23
ALEJANDRA Do we have to write our full name? 

00:38:23
SHERI BAUMAN No. Whatever you want. That's on you. Whatever you want to use. 

00:38:30
Actual exercise time: 9 minutes 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:35
SHERI BAUMAN Since I'm already done. 

00:38:35
TYLER I can get you a black marker if you want. 

00:39:15
JUSTIN Yeah. 

00:39:15
SHERI BAUMAN You think we could start sharing? 

00:39:20
TYLER Sure. 

00:39:25
SAM STEEN Yeah, I think so. I think there was only a few more though. 

00:39:30
SHERI BAUMAN So they can maybe finish as the first people go. But let's try to listen to each other like you did with me and ask questions if you wanna know more 'cuz this is really a good way to get to know each other. 

00:39:40
TYLER Are we gonna do all of them or just like a couple? 

00:39:45
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think? 

00:39:45
BRIANNA Do all of them. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, 'cuz they're repetitive, huh? Let's do 'em all. 

00:39:50
TYLER All right. 

00:39:50
SHERI BAUMAN Thanks. So who's gonna start going? 

00:39:55
TYLER You start. 

00:39:55
BRIANNA Why? 

00:40:00
TYLER Just do it. 

00:40:00
BRIANNA I don't wanna. 

00:40:00
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Just do it. 

00:40:00
TYLER Okay, I'll start then. 

00:40:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Thank you. 

00:40:05
TYLER Okay. So. 

00:40:05
SHERI BAUMAN Can we look at it while you, yeah. 

00:40:05
TYLER Yeah. Uh, the first thing I did was, like places that I've been. I lived in Montana 'cuz, like, all my family's from Montana. That's where my parents grew up. San Diego 'cuz I tried to draw like a wave. I love the beaches and the ocean and stuff. Um, down here, people who inspire me, Brett Favre, 'cuz he's like the best quarterback ever and then my dad 'cuz sometimes he can, like, inspire me to do things. Um, things I'm good at, sports. I'm, I'm good at football and basketball. I'm pretty much, I'm good at most of the sports but I think I'm best at football and, uh, pretty good at video games. Um, I, I like playing video games and I tried drawing a controller but it didn't work out very well. Uh, what I wanna do. I, I, I wanna be a pro football player 'cuz, you know, I love to play sports and make a million dollars 'cuz then I'd be set and yeah. So. 

00:41:10
SAM STEEN You just wanna make one? It says one million dollars. 

00:41:10
TYLER (crosstalk) Well, well, I don't know. 

00:41:10
SAM STEEN Just one? 

00:41:10
TYLER That's like the minimum. 

00:41:15
SAM STEEN Minimum. There you go. 

00:41:15
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Minimum. 

00:41:15
SAM STEEN In the first year. 

00:41:15
TYLER Yeah. 

00:41:15
SHERI BAUMAN Tyler, I was curious about you said that sometimes your dad inspires you. Do you ever tell him that? Does he know that you think of him that way? 

00:41:25
TYLER Yeah, I, I mean, I tell him sometimes like when I do stuff, like. 'Cuz, I mean, there some things that I don't really like wanna do all the time but then he makes me go do it and then I turn out I like it, so, you know, I've told him that. 

00:41:40
SHERI BAUMAN That's cool 'cuz I think, um, sometimes we admire people and they don't even know. 

00:41:45
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) It is. 

00:41:45
TYLER Yeah. 

00:41:45
SHERI BAUMAN You know what I mean? So that's really cool, especially when it's a parent. 

00:41:45
TYLER Yeah. 

00:41:45

00:42:25
TYLER Yeah. I don't know. 

00:42:30
SHERI BAUMAN How do you guys know all this stuff? Well, I guess it's just. 

00:42:30

00:42:30
SHERI BAUMAN I see. Thanks Tyler and thanks for going first and taking that risk. 

00:42:40
TYLER Welcome. 

00:42:40
BRIANNA Well, I put, um, for the places, like, I've been that I like, I was born in Pennsylvania, so.

00:42:45
BRIANNA Um, Harrisburg. 

00:42:50
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

00:42:50
SAM STEEN Oh. 

00:42:50
BRIANNA And I like California and especially the sand dunes that are there because I am in motocross and play softball and (inaudible ) and I'm good at driving 'cuz I drive around my neighborhood. 

00:43:05
SAM STEEN You can drive? 

00:43:05
BRIANNA Yeah. 

00:43:10
SAM STEEN A car? 

00:43:10
BRIANNA I can drive a stick and the, uh... 

00:43:10
SHERI BAUMAN Not legally, but you can drive. 

00:43:15
SAM STEEN Wow. Who taught you how to drive? 

00:43:15
BRIANNA Myself. 

00:43:15
SAM STEEN Wow. 

00:43:15
BRIANNA And, uh, I wanna, first of all, I wanna graduate high school. I wanna pass with all good grades and I wanna become a vet. 

00:43:25
SHERI BAUMAN A vet as in veterinarian, not a veteran. 

00:43:30
BRIANNA Yeah. And, uh, the people who inspire me is my nana and my mom and dad and step-dad and step-mom and also my dog Jenny. She saved my life because a psycho man came up behind me, he was like crazy. My dog, um, killed him but she also got shot in the chest that day. So she saved my life but she died. So. 

00:44:00
SAM STEEN Wow. Like she really saved your life is what you're saying. 

00:44:05
BRIANNA Yeah, she, he had, he had a gun and I was right by my house and she, she used, she is a retired police dog, she was a retired police dog, so she knew what to do. 

00:44:15
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:44:15
BRIANNA And so now I never walk in alleys by myself. So. 

00:44:20
SHERI BAUMAN Wow. 

00:44:20
SAM STEEN Thanks for 4haring. That's a pretty amazing story. 

00:44:25
SHERI BAUMAN Well we didn't hear the other things 'cuz we got so, what are things, your other. Oh yes, you did say. I'm sorry. How old were you when that happened? Were you? 

00:44:30
BRIANNA I was walking home in 6th grade, so it was like two years ago. 

00:44:35
SHERI BAUMAN Wow. 

00:44:35
TYLER What kind of dog was it? 

00:44:40
BRIANNA A German Shepard. 

00:44:40
TYLER Oh, nice. 

00:44:40
SAM STEEN Even when you talk about it, you can tell it's something that still causes you. 

00:44:45
BRIANNA Well, she was always there next to me, even when I was, 'cuz when my parents were going through the divorce, it was really ugly so she was my, like, security blanket but it was a dog. So I was always next to her and she was always next to me, even when I slept. She slept in the same room as me and she'd always be right there. So. 

00:45:05
SAM STEEN She was protecting you the whole time, huh? Any other questions about Bri's? 

00:45:15
ALEJANDRA Why do you wanna become a vet? Do you love animals? 

00:45:20
BRIANNA Ever since that happened, I was like I'm gonna become a vet. I'm gonna save other dogs because my dog saved me. 

00:45:20
SHERI BAUMAN Wow. 

00:45:20
SAM STEEN Wow. 

00:45:20
SHERI BAUMAN Thanks. I have tears in my eyes. I never, that doesn't happen to me very often but I'm very close to my dogs too and.. 

00:45:35
BRIANNA And then I also, I snapped my leg in half at the sand dunes when I was (inaudible ). She was there also, so she went and got my family 'cuz I was laying at the top of a hill. I didn't cry though, so. 

00:45:55
SHERI BAUMAN So this was a pretty amazing dog. 

00:45:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) You're pretty tough. 

00:45:55
BRIANNA She was, she was a dog. 

00:46:00
SHERI BAUMAN Wow. Well thanks. 

00:46:05
SAM STEEN You wanna go next? 

00:46:05
TYLER I'll go. So I put my name and then I put, uh, places that I enjoy is Washington, D.C. I used to live there for four years and I had, I liked learning about all the history that happened there and then my favorite baseball team's there. Um, I have fun at any type of baseball park, like a little league field or a major league baseball park, just somewhere 'cuz I feel like it's another home for me is a baseball park. And then I like the beach in (inaudible ) 'cuz I love running into the waves and the waves just knocking me over. Um, people that inspire me are all my family members because I just love the way they do things and I wish I do things like them. Um, Derek Jeter 'cuz he's a classy baseball player but he's also very classy outside. He, um, he sponsors a group for, um, kids with autism and all his donations he makes it goes toward that group. 

00:47:05
SAM STEEN Did you know that? 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:05
SAM STEEN Oh really? 

00:47:05
TYLER And then, um, Rick Riordan, I just like his writing 'cuz I like Greek mythology and it just interests me. Um, I like sports. I feel I'm good at sports. Um, I feel I'm pretty good in school. I got a 4.0. I've had a 4.0 for the past four years and I feel like I'm pretty good at having fun. I try to enjoy myself a lot and then when I grow up, I wanna travel the world and I wanna visit all the ball parks for Major League Baseball in the world. I wanna have lots of money and I wanna be involved in a pro sport. 

00:47:45
SAM STEEN And you, what do you mean by that? So you don't necessarily have to be playing baseball? 

00:47:55
TYLER Yeah, like, like I wouldn't mind being, like an announcer or a trainer or something like that. I just wouldn't, I just, something that involved in a pro sport. 

00:48:00
SHERI BAUMAN That's really cool 'cuz then you have more choices. You know, there's someone else here from D.C. or who lives in D.C. Did you know that? 

00:48:10
TYLER Uh-uh. 

00:48:10
SHERI BAUMAN Who do you think it might be? 

00:48:15
SAM STEEN Yeah, yeah. I live in D.C. 

00:48:15
TYLER Lucky. I wanna move back. 

00:48:20
SAM STEEN You do? You wanna move back? You'll come visit. I work at George Washington University. You've probably seen it when you were doing the tour. 

00:48:30
TYLER Yeah. 

00:48:30
SAM STEEN Any other questions for Tyler? 

00:48:35
JUSTIN What's your favorite major league baseball team? 

00:48:35
TYLER The Washington Nationals. 

00:48:40
JUSTIN Oh, man. Obviously. 

00:48:40
SHERI BAUMAN Are they any good? 

00:48:45
TYLER No. 

00:48:45
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

00:48:45
TYLER They're the worst, like the worst team. 

00:48:45
SAM STEEN Yeah, they are. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:48:50
TYLER The only reason I like 'em is 'cuz I've been a fan since their inaugural game. So since the first game they've ever paid and so I've just stuck with 'em. 

00:48:55
SAM STEEN I can appreciate that. Some people jump on the bandwagon. 

00:49:00
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) So you're loyal. 

00:49:00
SAM STEEN When they're good, they're gonna come back around. 

00:49:00
ALEJANDRA Do you have a team for baseball that you hate? 

00:49:05
TYLER Uh, Yankees. 

00:49:05
ALEJANDRA (inaudible ). 

00:49:09
TYLER It's just the Yankees are a money team, except for Jeter. They have a couple of players that, like, they have players that have class but most of 'em just joined the Yankees for money. Like the, they, most of 'em have been on another team and they just go to the Yankees for money. 

00:49:25
SAM STEEN Yeah. That's hard to pass though, you know? 

00:49:25
TYLER Yeah. 

00:49:25
SAM STEEN If you're like the other Tyler, you might go for it. You gotta start somewhere. Have you been to that stadium? 

00:49:35
TYLER What, the National stadium? 

00:49:35
SAM STEEN No, no. The one in, um, I guess New York or wherever? 

00:49:40
ALEJANDRA The Yankee Stadium? 

00:49:40
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) The old one, I guess. 

00:49:40
ALEJANDRA The Yankee Stadium. 

00:49:40
TYLER I've been, I've been to the old one and the new one. 

00:49:45
SAM STEEN You've been to the old and the new. Thanks. Should I go next? Do you wanna go next? 

00:49:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, no, you don't have... 

00:49:50
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:49:50
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, good. Thanks. We don't have to go in order. 

00:49:55
JUSTIN Well, a place I went to, this was last year, I went to Florida, um, with my football team. We're the Tuscon Chargers. Um, we placed first in state and we went down to Phoenix and won 63 to seven. 

00:50:10
SAM STEEN Blown out. 

00:50:10
JUSTIN Yeah. And, um, went up to Florida and won two out of three games, got third place and, um, we're looking the same this year except for I'm on the Tuscon Falcons. Um, my number's 50, um, like my dad. My dad played at the University of Arizona and my dad's a big role model for me. Um, Darnell Docket (ph) plays for the Arizona Cardinals and he, he's got, he plays my position, a very good defensive tackle. Um, I, I like to try to (inaudible ) myself with some of the things that he does and I can (inaudible ) my performance. It really does. Um, my father is a role model for me and so is my mother, um, because they're very, my father is a very social person. My mom is a very independent woman and, um, uh, she's, she knows how to, she's a mom. She comforts me, so. Um, things I wanna, the things I'm good at is playing football. Um, public speaking. I do pretty well public speaking-wise. Um, I can go up in front of a group of people. I don't get nervous and I'm very social. Um, things I wanna do in my, when I get older is play in the NFL, um, get my law degree and, um, because I wanna become a lawyer if the NFL thing doesn't work out and I wanna go to the University of Oregon. 

00:51:40
SAM STEEN What's the name of their mascot there? 

00:51:45
JUSTIN Um. 

00:51:45
SAM STEEN The Ducks? 

00:51:45
JUSTIN Yeah. 

00:51:45
SAM STEEN That's what I thought. The Ducks. 

00:51:50
JUSTIN Yeah. I like their uniforms. They have fly uniforms. 

00:51:55
SAM STEEN (inaudible ). 

00:51:56
JUSTIN And they're a good team. They're really a very good team. They produce a lot of good linemen. 

00:52:00
SHERI BAUMAN So tell us, you've mentioned Florida. Can you tell us about the other two places that you? 

00:52:05
JUSTIN Oh yeah. Um, Washington D.C. My dad grew up there and, um, on, I think it was 4th Avenue. Yeah. 

00:52:15
SAM STEEN Do you know if it was southeast or northeast or southeast. 

00:52:20
JUSTIN Southeast. 

00:52:20
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. I know what you're talking about. 

00:52:20
JUSTIN It was a rough part of town. 

00:52:20
SAM STEEN It's southeast probably. 

00:52:20
JUSTIN Yeah. Um, and California. That's where my mom, my mom is from. She's from, uh, Seritos, California. It's in Anaheim, I mean, right around the Anaheim area. And, uh, I go out there and I stay, I stay with my grandma. My grandpa has a, uh, dementia and Alzheimer's, um, so I try to be with him as much as I can. That's why I like to go out there. And that's about it. 

00:52:50
ALEJANDRA What is that your grandpa has? 

00:52:50
JUSTIN Um, it's, comes with age and, uh, steals his brain. It's de-aging, I guess. Basically it's making him seem like he's younger. He doesn't know where he's at most of the time. Doesn't know how to do, like, drink water or eat. So. 

00:53:10
SAM STEEN He doesn't always, does he recognize you or? 

00:53:15
JUSTIN Um, sometimes. He, he, he, only time he recognizes me is when I stand up 'cuz he sees that, he sees I'm big and stuff. He's like, he has to get all, real close and he has to see you, he has (inaudible ) and then he'll recognize me. But it really hurts my mom because he barely recognizes her. 

00:53:35
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:53:35
SHERI BAUMAN You know, both of my parents had that at the end of their lives and it's really hard to watch someone, so that's neat that you go to see him rather than say well, you know. 

00:53:45
JUSTIN Well, my grandpa's, used to take me, me and my cousins (inaudible ), take 'em to Toys R Us, got get ice cream. And when my mom told him not to, he'd do it anyway. 

00:54:00
BRIANNA That's what I do. When my parents say no, I just go ask my grandmother. 

00:54:05
JUSTIN Grandparents. They're always there for you. 

00:54:10
End of Session 1 Part 1 

00:54:15
[sil.] 

00:54:15
Session 1 Part 2 

00:54:20
[music] 

00:54:20
SHERI BAUMAN So who haven't we heard from? Who's gonna go next? 

00:54:20
TAHLIA Um, me. 

00:54:20
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:54:20
TAHLIA Okay. 

00:54:20
SHERI BAUMAN Can we see? Thank you. 

00:54:30
TAHLIA So, people that inspire me are things. Books inspire me, like a lot. They help me dream. 

00:54:40
SHERI BAUMAN Do you have a favorite one? 

00:54:40
TAHLIA No. And my drama teacher, Ms. Krosmay (ph). She inspires me. She's like, I don't know, she's like, really fun to be around. And Vincent Van Gogh. He inspires me because he's like an artist and I'm an artist, so, like, I don't know. Yeah. And then my mom inspires me of course. And then, um, I'm really good at art and math. I'm really good at math and reading and memorizing things. It's real easy and, um, I can tell you anything you want to know about Harry Potter. And I'm good at cursive. And I wanna be really successful when I'm older. Like I wanna have a nice house and nice kids and I wanna go to college at the U of A. Like first at the U of A and then somewhere else. Like, I wanna get, um, doctor's degree, a PhD. Yeah. And then, um, I wanna do something, like, to change the world. I don't know. Like, like to write a book and like it changes, like Harry Potter. Like that, yeah. And, um, oh yeah, JK Rowling. She inspired me too. And then, um, I have a lot of fun at school. It's like a place that I love. And, um, Oregon. I was born in Oregon so, like I have a, I still have friends there that I still talk to and, uh, Ale's house too. And then, um, and Colorado. I used to live in Colorado and we would steal the neighbor's flowers and put it in her own yard. And then, um, actually like everywhere I go, it's, make the best out of it. And that's all. Yeah. 

00:57:20
SHERI BAUMAN Thanks. I'm gonna point out something. I don't know if anybody noticed but, um, you would look at me a lot and did you notice what I was doing? 

00:57:30
JUSTIN Reassuring her? 

00:57:30
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I hope I was doing that too but a lot of times I also looked away and the reason I did that is I want you to talk to each other and sometimes it's easy to talk to the, you know, to the facilitator or the counselor so I, I want you to know I do have good manners and I do look at people when they're talking to me but if I look away, it's to encourage you to look at the other members of the group. I, you told us about all the people who inspire you except your mom. What is it about her, aside from just her being your mom? 

00:58:05
TAHLIA Well, that she's, like, um. 

00:58:15
[sil.] 

00:58:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Thanks. 

00:58:15
SAM STEEN Well you're smiling and crying at the same time, huh? There's some Kleenex there. It's okay. 

00:58:25
ALEJANDRA She laughs when she cries. 

00:58:30
SAM STEEN Yeah? 

00:58:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:58:30
SAM STEEN While she's taking a moment, is anybody else wanna think of a question for her, because when I heard you talk, Tahlia, it was amazing that you don't dream just a little bit. You dream big, you know? Like you say you wanna write a book to transform generations. I mean, that was inspirational to me, just to hear you say that. That's pretty amazing, you know? So I just wanna make that comment. 

00:59:05
[sil.] 

00:59:05
ALEJANDRA Do what now? 

00:59:05
SAM STEEN No. I wasn't, anybody else have a question for her or thought or something that came to mind when you heard her talk? 

00:59:10
TYLER I have a question. Uh, you said you don't have a favorite book but do you have a favorite series of books? 

00:59:15
TAHLIA No, it's not my favorite. I just like it a lot. 

00:59:25
[sil.] 

00:59:25
SHERI BAUMAN Is it okay with you if we move on to someone else? Okay, thanks. 

00:59:35
ALEJANDRA I'm gonna start with people who inspire me. I just put their initials. Lady Gaga 'cuz I really think she's doing something for, like people that judge those who are different, sexual, you know. And, um. 

00:59:55
SAM STEEN Can you say that again? Lady Gaga because she does what? 

01:00:00
ALEJANDRA Like, I don't know how to say. Like, you know, if you're, like, if you're a girl and you like girls there are some people that can't (inaudible ). 

01:00:11
UNKNOWN Express. 

01:00:11
ALEJANDRA Express themselves, like, they're scared to come out and tell the world that. 

01:00:15
SAM STEEN So Lady Gaga allows sort of a voice to people like that? 

01:00:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Dr. Seuss. Um, C.S. Lewis. 

01:00:25
SAM STEEN Dr. Seuss because? 

01:00:25
ALEJANDRA Um, I like his books a lot and I like his TV show. 

01:00:30
SAM STEEN His TV show? The cartoon? 

01:00:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. I watch cartoons. 

01:00:35
SAM STEEN Me too. 

01:00:40
ALEJANDRA Um, C.S. Lewis 'cuz he had an amazing imagination. He's the author of Narnia. Um, my sister. Her name is (inaudible[01:0053]). She's a nurse at Del Rio. She inspires me to be someone in life. Um, I'm good at video games, I guess. I don't like to brag or anything, so. 

01:01:10
SAM STEEN You think you can beat Tyler? 

01:01:10
ALEJANDRA Depends on the video game. 

01:01:10
TYLER I, I don't know. 

01:01:15
ALEJANDRA I can probably beat you in Halo. 

01:01:15
TYLER Maybe, but I don't play that game very much 'cuz I don't have an X-Box. 

01:01:20
ALEJANDRA Exactly. I'm good with babies. Um, I guess I'm kind of okay in singing. I don't know. I think so. And reading. Um, I wanna deliver a baby and make my dad proud. Become a forensic anthropologist or if that doesn't work out, um, it's like a special, just one subject of Greek mythology, a Greek mythology professor. Um, California 'cuz I was born there and my great, great, great grandma lives there. Um, Mexico 'cuz my grandma and my uncle, my (inaudible ), my grandpa live there. And school 'cuz I learn something everyday. Um, yeah. 

01:02:25
[sil.] 

01:02:25
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody wondering anything that you wanna ask? 

01:02:30
BRIANNA What's the most interesting thing you learned at school? 

01:02:35
ALEJANDRA Hold on. Newton's Law of Motion, in science. I found that fascinating. 

01:02:45
SAM STEEN Do you also write? You said you like, you're good at reading. 

01:02:50
ALEJANDRA Like writing, like write stories you mean? 

01:02:55
SAM STEEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:02:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. I like writing. 

01:03:00
SAM STEEN Or music. You talk about singing. Do you write music? 

01:03:00
ALEJANDRA No. 

01:03:00
SAM STEEN Songs, you don't write songs? 

01:03:00
ALEJANDRA No. I just sing 'em. 

01:03:05
SAM STEEN Just sing 'em? 

01:03:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:03:05
SHERI BAUMAN What prompted that question? What were you? 

01:03:10
SAM STEEN Well, she reads a lot and she likes to sing a little bit and she likes the creative arts, so I thought maybe she was also a musician, or writes music. 

01:03:20
SHERI BAUMAN So Sam. 

01:03:25
SAM STEEN I have one. Okay, so I'll start with, um, what is this section again? 

01:03:35
JUSTIN Places. 

01:03:35
SAM STEEN Places you've been? 

01:03:35
JUSTIN Yes. 

01:03:35
SAM STEEN So I love the West Coast. Is Arizona considered the West Coast? 

01:03:40
SHERI BAUMAN No. 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) No. It's not. 

01:03:40
SAM STEEN It's all relative, right? Where we live, it's considered the West Coast. 

01:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I, I think so. 

01:03:45
SAM STEEN Yeah. Right. I love the west coast. I would live there because the weather's so temperate. I like the climate and when I was in middle school, elementary to middle school, I lived in Germany. So I lived overseas. My dad was in the military, so liked that. I wanna go back. I wish I can work overseas or maybe, um, study overseas as well. The people who inspire me are parents and mentors. I have a lot of mentors They don't always know that they're my mentors but I look up to people who are older than me and have done other things so I think that that's pretty, um, significant and where I am today. Sheri's actually one of my mentors. I don't know if I've ever told her that but she's one. And then the Bible and books like, um, Tahlia inspire me. So in the Bible, characters in the Bible. I mentioned Samuel. Some of these people had some terrible life situations but they always tend to end, most of the time, in a positive way. So it's like you take your tragedies or challenges and turn them into things that are meaningful and helpful to your life and then books. And most recently I read a book about a particular country in Africa and all the stories that were involved in those, that tribe of, in that book, and it was just interesting to see that. And then, um, I feel like like one of my skills, I don't know if it's really a skill but the way I characterizing it, is I can get along with anybody, even people that don't like me, I can get along with them and then I used to be really good at basketball but as I get older, I need to find another sport that I can do because the last time I, not the last time but a couple years ago when I played, I hurt myself and it took forever to heal. So I think the older you get, the longer it takes to get well. So I need to play something like golf. Gonna walk around, you know, or maybe go for walks or something. My goals are to be a good dad. I have a 5 year old daughter and a son on the way. He's due in January. So I wanna be a good dad. And then I wanna travel. Those are my hopes and dream, to be able to get paid to travel, you know? I think that'll be fun. So that people pay. Like I had to pay to come here. I think I'll get money back but I'd love for people to pay for me to go to do something. I wrote my name outside of this box 'cuz I don't wanna fit into a box. I get this question all the time, like what country are you from. People ask me all the time what country am I from and they always mean like what African country are you from and I kind of chuckle and say I was born in Memphis, Tennessee. One time I was at the grocery store and this lady said what country are you from and I said I was born in Memphis, Tennessee. She said stop lying. She said you're from Ghana and I said no, honestly I'm not. I was born in Memphis, Tennessee. She said you should be proud of yourself. You're from Ghana and I'm so embarrassed that you're ashamed to be. So I, I mean, I've even gotten threatened by somebody who wanted to make me from another country but I'm not. You know, terrible but true. So I like to think that I can't really be fit into any sort of category maybe because my dad was in the military and we traveled all over the place and I can get along with anybody 'cuz it forces you to get along with people when you move every two or three years. Um, but that's why I drew my name in that way. But that's it. 

01:06:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, way cool. I've known you for a long time and I learned some things and that's my question for all of you. Well, this is really the first session that we've had to get to know each other a little bit. What do you think, um, was the most surprising thing that you heard or the most, the thing that touched you the most, as you heard, got to know people a bit? 

01:07:15
TYLER The dog story. That was pretty awesome. 

01:07:20
SAM STEEN Which dog story? 

01:07:20
TYLER The one with, the one she got saved by her dog. 

01:07:25
SAM STEEN Oh yeah. 

01:07:25
SHERI BAUMAN When who got saved by her dog? 

01:07:25
TYLER Brianna. 

01:07:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, yeah. Let's, we learned the names so let's. 

01:07:30
JUSTIN Which, which little (inaudible ) alley when she broke her leg. 

01:07:35
SAM STEEN Exactly. 

01:07:35
UNKNOWN In the alley. 

01:07:35
TYLER Oh, yeah. Or that one. The dog like killed the guy. Yeah, that's pretty cool. 

01:07:40
SHERI BAUMAN I was impressed at how many of you said unexpected things about that you like mythology or that, you know, um, that you, that you read and you're inspired by authors and so forth. I, I guess, that just surprised me in a very positive way. What else? What other comments do you have about getting to know each other in this way? Any thoughts? 

01:08:25
SAM STEEN I was surprised at how emotional Tahlia got about her mom. Surprise is probably the wrong word. I guess. 

01:08:30
JUSTIN Unexpected. 

01:08:30
SAM STEEN Maybe unexpected. 

01:08:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:08:35
SAM STEEN Well I appreciate her just being able to do that, you know? 

01:08:40
SHERI BAUMAN So what do you think we gained from doing this? This was our first real session. 

01:08:50
JUSTIN Getting comfortable with the group. 

01:08:55
SHERI BAUMAN So you think you're more comfortable now than when we started? 

01:08:55
JUSTIN Yeah. Um, I, I don't know about you guys but I feel more comfortable. 

01:09:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:09:00
SAM STEEN You (inaudible ) Tyler, this Tyler? 

01:09:05
TYLER Yeah. 

01:09:05
SHERI BAUMAN What else? 

01:09:10
[sil.] 

01:09:10
SHERI BAUMAN I don't know about you but when I was doing mine, I was surprised at kind of the thoughts that came to me or which ones were hard and which ones were easy to think of. Anybody else have that experience? 

01:09:25
JUSTIN Yeah, it was weird for me to, it was kind of hard for me to describe my mom because, like I said, she's very independent. She's very quiet but she knows so much and, you know. 

01:09:45
SHERI BAUMAN It's interesting that so many of you mentioned your parents in that way, in a positive way. I have to say when I was 8, in 8th grade, I wasn't seeing a positive aspects of my parents very much. So I think that's really cool from, both from being a, a teenager at one time and also from being a mom. I'd like to think sometimes. 

01:10:10
JUSTIN I don't know if many kids wanna hear this. Like, like, um, I really think of it this way but my dad asked, you know, in the car today and I guess it, a comment made last night and he, it was a person that said they, they didn't like someone, that they hated someone and it was very close to their family and my dad asked me the same question in the car today. Did I hate him? And I was like what are you talking about? And he was like well, I'm hard on you, a lot. I was like well that's what you're supposed to do. You're my father. You're supposed to be like that and I appreciate that. I might not like it at the time but when I'm your age or your age, I'm gonna look back on it and I'm gonna be like it's a great thing that he did, to push me that extra, extra way in school so I could be where I am today. 

01:11:05
BRIANNA Yeah, in my opinion I think the parents should be hard on you because my, um, cousin's mom, she was on meth and she didn't really care what her kids do, whatever, and both of them are in prison now because they were allowed to do, they didn't have any ground rules. They were allowed to be out whenever they want, just anything. So, what, now saying, hearing that, like, I know 'cuz I get in trouble a lot and so what my parents do, they're just trying to help me and not be mean but, even though they are. 

01:11:40
SAM STEEN So it sounds like you also agree with Justin on that aspect. Anybody else have a thought about that? Even parents being hard on you or adults, you know, trying to apply some structure in your life? 

01:12:05
[sil.] 

01:12:05
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you know, this has been a long session so I think, um, we need to end for today. Does anybody have any last minute thoughts, something that you haven't said that you wanna say at this point? 

01:12:20
SAM STEEN Well, I just. Go ahead. 

01:12:20
ALEJANDRA You. 

01:12:20
SAM STEEN No, no. You. 

01:12:20
ALEJANDRA You. 

01:12:25
SAM STEEN You first. Ladies first. 

01:12:25
ALEJANDRA Um, I forgot to write down the show Bones, it inspired me. 

01:12:30
SAM STEEN The show Bones. What about it? 

01:12:35
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Have you seen it? 

01:12:35
SAM STEEN No. 

01:12:35
ALEJANDRA It's about, um, this girl name Brennan and she's a forensic anthropologist and just like all her, her work members are like really smart and it inspires me to be smart. Like, you know what a forensic anthropologist is, right? 

01:12:50
TYLER No. 

01:12:55
ALEJANDRA It's like, um, let's say someone was murdered. They figure out exactly how, like... 

01:13:00
TYLER Oh. I thought it had something to do with science. 

01:13:05
ALEJANDRA They're just like, really, really smart. 

01:13:10
JUSTIN I forgot to say something. 

01:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN What's that? 

01:13:15
JUSTIN Um, I should have mentioned my grandma more um, because she's, uh, my grandfather, um, I told you about him and how he has Alzheimer's and dementia. I went with her to his home that he's in and I wanted to spend time with him and it was time for them to eat and I was helping him eat and, like, I just looked over to my grandma and she got all teary eyed and I think it, she really hit her that, um, my grandfather isn't going to be around here longer and I think I should, I wanna do more with my grandmother because what if that, what if something like that happens to her and I'm glad I spent the way I did with my grandfather and I'm glad we had a tight relationship like that. Um, yeah. 

01:14:05
SAM STEEN So you just wanna acknowledge your grandmother as well? 

01:14:10
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. 

01:14:10
SAM STEEN What I was thinking was that there were a lot of similarities in some of the things, like the beach and you talked about parents and video games, a lot of travel. But there's also some differences as well and there's, there's nothing wrong with that. We don't have to all agree on anything. Just continue to be yourself and share what's ever on your mind. 

01:14:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, thanks. We'll see everybody next week. 

01:14:35
End of Session 1 Part 2

[music] 

01:14:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, welcome back everyone. The week went awfully quickly. It feels like it was just a few minutes ago that we met last time and I don't know about you, but I felt like we really learned a lot about each other, um, during that session and, and that we accomplished a lot. So just to start out, so we can hear everybody's voice, if you could finish the sentence Right now I'm feeling. 

01:15:20
ALEJANDRA Crappy. I don't know. 

01:15:25
TYLER I'm glad to be here. 

01:15:25
BRIANNA (inaudible ).

01:15:50
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:15:50
SAM STEEN She was giving her dap, hmm? 

01:15:55
TYLER Oh, pretty much what Justin said, focused. 

01:15:55
SAM STEEN Focused on what? I'm sorry. You're focused on? 

01:16:00
TYLER Doing this. 

01:16:00
SAM STEEN On doing this? On being here? 

01:16:00
TYLER Yeah. 

01:16:00
JUSTIN Being here, yes. 

01:16:05
SAM STEEN Yes. I didn't know if you said like a football game or something else. 

01:16:05
JUSTIN Yeah, um, I actually do have a football game later. 

01:16:10
SHERI BAUMAN So, yeah. And we're gonna get you there. Hand? 

01:16:10
TAHLIA Um, like, an open mind. 

01:16:15
SHERI BAUMAN Great. 

01:16:15
SAM STEEN Mine's, right now, I'm feeling hungry, if you wanna be honest. Really hungry. 

01:16:20
SHERI BAUMAN Did you wanna add anything? 

01:16:25
BRIANNA I like, I don't know. I feel like I'm in the zone right now. 

01:16:25
TYLER The zone? 

01:16:30
SHERI BAUMAN Is that a good thing, to be in the zone? 

01:16:30
BRIANNA Yeah. 

01:16:30
SHERI BAUMAN Good. All right. So we're all looking forward to this session. Any, anybody have anything that's on your mind that you wanted to share with this group before we move to an activity, because the most important thing in this group is you guys. So if there's something on your mind, um, we wanna give you a chance before we introduce an activity. Okay, is that an okay to go ahead? 

01:17:00
TYLER Yeah. 

01:17:00
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:17:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:17:00
SAM STEEN It's hard to say because of the body language, you know, with the chairs and you guys are moving and sometimes we try to pay attention to your body language to see if it can give us an indicator or some sort of idea of how you're feeling. Like last time I noticed the longer we talked, the more people started leaning back like this, which means you're tired or hungry or you need a break, right? 

01:17:25
SHERI BAUMAN And everybody was very attentive, even though we went so long. 

01:17:25
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Even though. 

01:17:25
SHERI BAUMAN So that's pretty amazing. This is. 

01:17:30
SAM STEEN Or you tap your feet. We might start saying so, what does that mean Tyler, when you tap your feet? Don't be surprised though. Well this activity is another way of getting to know you and to share a little bit about some experiences maybe that you've had so you're gonna have to physically move around a little bit. Just, you're gonna have to stand up and come to the middle if this applies to you. So for example if I say how many of you have a dollar in your pocket, um, then you would get up and you come to the middle, right, if you have a dollar in your pocket. You got it? Of if I say something like how many of you like, um, when it's sunny outside? And you would get up and you'd come. So it's another way of illustrating something about yourself. So when you're ready, I'll start. The first one is, um, if you wear glasses or contacts, go to the middle. 

01:18:15
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, I thought I was gonna be the only one. 

01:18:20
SAM STEEN Okay, thanks. So Tyler just had a comment now, this Tyler over here, said I feel left out already. You wish you wore glasses? 

01:18:30
TYLER Yeah. 

01:18:30
SAM STEEN Okay, you ready? Brown hair. Who has brown hair, come to the middle. 

01:18:35
TAHLIA I'm guessing I'm brown. 

01:18:35
SAM STEEN Anybody else? Okay. Take a look around. All right. Who had, or comes from a large family and you can describe a large family any way you want? 

01:18:45
UNKNOWN Wait, what's a large? 

01:18:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:18:50
SAM STEEN Whatever you think. Large family. Okay. A couple of you. And what about who plays a sport? Okay. What about who likes candy. I wish I could for this one. 

01:19:15
JUSTIN I love candy. 

01:19:15
SAM STEEN All right. Another round. Who in here does their homework but doesn't turn it in? We have any of those people? 

01:19:30
JUSTIN Sometimes. 

01:19:30
SAM STEEN A little bit further. 

01:19:30
JUSTIN I do that sometimes, not all the time. 

01:19:35
SAM STEEN Yeah, sometimes you do it but you don't turn it in, right? 

01:19:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:19:35
SAM STEEN Thanks for being honest. And then who, uh, goes to church or synagogue or place of worship? All right, thanks. Do we have anybody here who's considered a senior citizen. 

01:19:55
SHERI BAUMAN I should be tottering in with my cane. 

01:20:00
SAM STEEN No, you wanna be exercising at night. 

01:20:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, that's right. So I should be jumping in. 

01:20:05
SAM STEEN Who in here would consider themselves African American? Go a little further. Thank you. What about Latino? Oh wow. 

01:20:15
UNKNOWN You're that too? 

01:20:20
SAM STEEN Latino? Yes. 

01:20:20
TAHLIA Yeah. 

01:20:20
SAM STEEN Maybe Hispanic? Oh, okay. All right, have a seat. Anybody in here who would consider themselves Asian? 

01:20:30
ALEJANDRA Tahlia would. 

01:20:30
SAM STEEN Yes? Do you, if it's yes? 

01:20:35
TAHLIA Not really but I say I am. 

01:20:35
SAM STEEN You say that you are because people ask you? 

01:20:40
TAHLIA Yeah. I think it's cool. 

01:20:40
SAM STEEN Okay. That's your choice. Who in here would consider themselves female? Okay. 

01:20:50
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk inaudible ) surprises today. 

01:20:53
SAM STEEN What about, um, who would consider themselves a person with a disability, like maybe you have an IP or, you know, (inaudible ) where... 

01:21:05
JUSTIN Like what do you, like... 

01:21:05
TYLER Oh, I have a disability. 

01:21:05
JUSTIN Like a physical disability. 

01:21:05
SAM STEEN It could be physical, it could be intellectual, it could, you know. 

01:21:10
TYLER (crosstalk) I know. 

01:21:10
SAM STEEN So, okay. You can have a seat. And then I've got a couple more. Who in here would consider themselves bi-racial, so maybe one parent's from one place and another parent's from another place? Or multi-racial. Okay. And who in here would consider themselves, oh, a gay. So gay or lesbian. Anybody? And then who in here would consider themselves, um, consider themselves or they've been in a situation where they were discriminated against. (inaudible ) Like any, doesn't matter what, just in any way. Okay. Have a seat. So think about some of those groups that we characterized. Do you remember them? There was race, sexual orientation, religion a little bit, maybe intelligence, um, characteristics about you doing homework, not doing homework, wearing glasses (inaudible ). What's something embarrassing or not so positive of being a, a member of one of those groups? And you can pick a group or, like anything. 

01:22:30
BRIANNA Well I have dyslexia. 

01:22:30
UNKNOWN When you talk? 

01:22:35
BRIANNA I get words, um, mixed up. 

01:22:35
SAM STEEN So that's not positive then? 

01:22:35
BRIANNA No. 

01:22:40
SAM STEEN The, the good news is it doesn't seem like we can look at you and tell you have dyslexia. 

01:22:40
BRIANNA Yeah, so like every time like they call me to read in class, I just, like, kinda lower myself so they can't see me. 

01:22:50
SHERI BAUMAN So it's embarrassing to, to do that. 

01:22:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk inaudible ). Yeah, yeah. Sounds like it. You were getting a little, I don't know what, maybe you were like, smiling or blushing or what but it looked like you had some sort of reaction to something that we just did. 

01:23:10
ALEJANDRA When? 

01:23:10
SAM STEEN Just before I asked the question about, after the question about discrimination or something like that. 

01:23:15
ALEJANDRA Oh, 'cuz they discriminate me a lot. 

01:23:20
SAM STEEN Regarding? 

01:23:20
ALEJANDRA Like, basically the boys, when, like, they find it shocking when I play video games. They just tell me oh, sell your X-Box. You shouldn't be playing games. You're a girl, you know? 

01:23:35
SAM STEEN Wow. 

01:23:35
ALEJANDRA My dad has done that, too. 

01:23:35
SAM STEEN Even your father says that. 

01:23:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:23:35
SAM STEEN That girls don't play video games. 

01:23:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:23:40
SHERI BAUMAN That's interesting because when I was growing up and I decided to go to college, um, people didn't mind too much until I graduated without a husband. So they thought it was okay for a girl to go to college so you could find a man that would, you know, not to get your own education or to just be educated and I, so sometimes people's attitudes about women and what they can do and not do are very frustrating. 

01:24:10
SAM STEEN What are some other things, though, that maybe, that... 

01:24:20
JUSTIN I get, um, sometimes at school, people make, uh, rude comments. Like, uh, racial stereotypes. Stuff like that. 

01:24:30
SHERI BAUMAN Other students you mean? 

01:24:30
JUSTIN Yes. And I get angry. 

01:24:30
SAM STEEN Directly to you or are you, you overhear them? 

01:24:35
JUSTIN Um, sometimes they be talking about, they'll, uh, talk behind my back, behind my back and, uh, I'll hear it and then I'll, like, ask them later what was that about or, um, sometimes they'll say it to me. 

01:24:50
SAM STEEN Do you mind giving an example? 

01:24:50
JUSTIN Um, um, like at lunch, uh, they would make fun of me and they'd, like some of the kids, like not my friends, um, they'd give, they'd like get a piece of fried chicken and, like, give it to me or something. 

01:25:05
SAM STEEN Oh wow. 

01:25:05
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:25:05
SAM STEEN Regarding food in this case. 

01:25:10
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:25:10
SAM STEEN Anybody have a feeling that they wanna share regarding what they just heard Justin say? Or reaction? What comes to mind when you hear him say that? 

01:25:20
ALEJANDRA Bully. 

01:25:20
SAM STEEN You see that as maybe a form of bullying? 

01:25:25
ALEJANDRA It is a form of bullying. 

01:25:25
JUSTIN And it interests me. Like, like they bully me and stuff but I, I really don't care. I don't, I mean... 

01:25:30
SAM STEEN You said it interests you. 

01:25:35
JUSTIN Yeah, because, as big as I am, I don't, feels weird that they come up and bully me. Like, little kids. Not like little kids but kids that are my age. 

01:25:45
SAM STEEN Yeah. But they're not even bigger than you is what you're saying. 

01:25:45
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:25:45
SAM STEEN So Alejandra, you see it as a form of bullying and Justin, you're saying it interests you that they're intrigued about your race? Is that what you're saying? 

01:25:55
JUSTIN Not so much that but they'll like mess with me that, in that way. 

01:26:00
SAM STEEN Oh, I see. 

01:26:00
JUSTIN Like to kind of taunt me or something and, um, yeah. I have a low tolerance for that stuff. 

01:26:10
BRIANNA Usually when kids do that at my school, I usually stand up for the other person 'cuz it angers me when they bully them for no reason. I hate it. 

01:26:20
SAM STEEN Is it similar to Justin's or anything? 

01:26:20
BRIANNA Just anything. 'Cuz there's like a kid who tripped a special ed kid on purpose and I got in a argument with him and, yeah. 

01:26:30
SAM STEEN You're doing the right thing if you stand up for someone. 

01:26:35
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) It takes... Yeah, I was gonna say that that takes a little bit, I always say to be an upstander instead of just a bystander. But that's biased based bully and that's really. 

01:26:45
JUSTIN At school, um, for example, there's a kid at my old school. At, um, in 6th grade, and we got into an argument at lunch and then in class he, uh, came up to me and he's like, he told me to shut up and then he said the N word. I got into a fight with him. 

01:27:05
SAM STEEN Really? Sixth grade and he said that? 

01:27:05
JUSTIN Yeah. Like, even at the young age, people act like that and I just, I'm like well why would you say that and I just got upset and... 

01:27:15
SAM STEEN Yeah. Tyler had a comment. 

01:27:20
TYLER Kids at our school that think they're all bad because they're like a certain type of race, like, we're, at my school, we have a lot of Hispanic people and white people and the Hispanic people think they're cooler than the white people and they just taunt, and they just like pick on the white people, which... 

01:27:35
SAM STEEN Are there more Hispanics at that school than white people? 

01:27:40
TYLER Yeah. 

01:27:40
ALEJANDRA The thing in our school, since we're in the Indian reservation, there's more Yuaci (ph) and Indian culture as our, like, we believe enough. Like, they deal with like, they believe where they want you fight them. That's they're main... 

01:28:00
TAHLIA They like it. 

01:28:00
ALEJANDRA They like to get in fights at school. 

01:28:00
SAM STEEN They prefer, is there a larger, larger numbers of the particular tribe that you're talking about? 

01:28:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:28:05
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Yeah. It's Yuaci. 

01:28:10
ALEJANDRA Yuaci. 

01:28:10
TAHLIA And it's very, like, on their reservation. 

01:28:10
SAM STEEN And the school's located there? 

01:28:15
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:28:15
SHERI BAUMAN So it sounds like whoever's the one minority in the particular place, you know, often is targeted for, based on bias. 

01:28:25
JUSTIN In my school, um, it, by, it's by Arizona National, no, Tuscon National, Arizona National, um, and in my school, I am the, in the junior high, there's only about 100 kids, maybe less, like 80 and I'm the only, uh, African American. 

01:28:45
SHERI BAUMAN In the whole school? 

01:28:45
JUSTIN Yep. In the whole junior high. 

01:28:50
SHERI BAUMAN Wow. 

01:28:50
JUSTIN And then there's two others in the elementary school. 

01:28:50
SAM STEEN Two? 

01:28:50
JUSTIN Yep. So there's three total. 

01:28:55
SHERI BAUMAN What's that feel like? 

01:28:55
JUSTIN Um, I get picked on a lot and, uh, I got into fights because of that and they keep doing it and I, I confronted the teachers. They don't really do anything about it. 

01:29:10
ALEJANDRA You confront the teachers, not the administrative, like... 

01:29:15
JUSTIN Yeah, I confronted the principal. Yeah. 

01:29:15
ALEJANDRA And you say they do nothing? 

01:29:15
JUSTIN Sometimes. They usually let it go. 

01:29:20
ALEJANDRA That's, like, I'm really anti-bully. Like I have a blog, like I speak of it a lot at my school. Like teachers don't really do nothing or students will commit suicide and it's just sad that they won't really pay attention to bullying. 

01:29:35
JUSTIN I, I'm not gonna like do that. 

01:29:40
ALEJANDRA No, I'm just saying. 

01:29:40
JUSTIN I, I, I mean, you can talk as much as you want. I, I don't care. 

01:29:45
SAM STEEN But in your case, you have those strengths. Right? You feel good. You have the support of family. 

01:29:50
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:29:50
SAM STEEN You a football player. But there are some kids like Alejandra's saying that maybe they don't feel the same way. 

01:29:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:29:55
SAM STEEN It doesn't always end in a person trying to kill themselves. 

01:30:00
SHERI BAUMAN Stiltner's been trying to get a word in in our (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:30:06
TYLER I think it's interesting to see, like, how people react to these type of things. Like, how some people just deal with it and others like stand up for themselves and you can tell the kind of, type of different people there. 

01:30:15
SHERI BAUMAN What does it take, do you think, for someone to be able to stand up for themselves? 

01:30:20
TAHLIA Courage. 

01:30:20
JUSTIN I'll stand up for myself but I mean, it's like that, that your parents will teach you if someone hits you and they beating on you. You wanna hit 'em back but I'm not, I, I mean, they're just words. Words can mean a lot but, to me, I know that I'm not like that. So I, just your opinion. It's your own opinion but there's also a line. 

01:30:50
ALEJANDRA So have you gotten into fights 'cuz of bullying? 

01:30:55
JUSTIN Um, yeah. We just, I told the teacher several occasions and the kid kept doing it. 

01:31:00
SHERI BAUMAN So it's calling you names and? 

01:31:00
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. And then he put his hands on me and I said that's not cool and we, we just got, it just escalated. 

01:31:10
SHERI BAUMAN Sam, I'm curious 'cuz when you, Sam got off the plane and he's from D.C. as we mentioned, where the population is much more diverse and you noticed what it's like to be a black person in, in, in an area where there are very few blacks. 

01:31:25
SAM STEEN Oh yes. I joked with Sheri about getting off of the plane, uh, Tuscon and I was checking my messages 'cuz when you're on the plane, it, the phone is cut off so I'm checking my messages, the texts and I'm walking through the, um, airport and, um, along the way, I, I started to look up. 'Cuz when you're checking your messages, you kind of focused on and then I look and I see these people looking at me and I look on this side and seen the look. See one lady look at me and turn her head right away. I thought man, where am I? I feel like a zoo creature. Like they had never seen this little... 

01:32:00
JUSTIN That's how I feel at my school. 

01:32:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:32:05
JUSTIN When we have, uh, get togethers, we have multi-cultural night and it's like for all the kids there and like all the parents go. It's all white families and there's our family, a minority family and they, and, uh, I say, they see me hanging out with their kids. I mean, I have friends at the school. 

01:32:20
SAM STEEN Of course. 

01:32:20
JUSTIN And they're like looking at me. I'm like, I just... 

01:32:25
SAM STEEN You're just a person. 

01:32:25
SAM STEEN Yeah, I'm just, I'm same as you. Just got a little color to the mix. 

01:32:30
SHERI BAUMAN Think how hard some of us have to work to get that color, right? 

01:32:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:32:35
SHERI BAUMAN We fry our skins and... 

01:32:35
SAM STEEN Well there are some other groups that we talked about, like race, right? We talked about sexual orientation a little bit. Um, disabilities. Are there any other groups that or that we talked about, male, female whatever where, you know, you want other people to know about it? That maybe there's some miss, uh, there's some miss... 

01:32:55
ALEJANDRA Understanding? 

01:32:55
SAM STEEN Understandings. Like he pointed out, you know, he has some brown and, um, uh, parents from two different cultures. 

01:33:05
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Religion. 

01:33:05
SAM STEEN Tell us about religion then Ale. 

01:33:05
ALEJANDRA Well, like, when a person comes from a different religion, like they believe, like most of us believe in Jesus and some other believe (inaudible ) and like different people, like. Yeah. 

01:33:20
SAM STEEN So what about that? You have different religions but what about it in your mind? 

01:33:25
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) So, like, I just think that everybody's a human being. Like, just because they believe in something else. I mean, it's an opinion, not a fact. Like, you know. Like they shouldn't ridicule what other people say. 

01:33:35
SAM STEEN You're saying we should be open no matter what. 

01:33:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:33:40
SAM STEEN It's just different. 

01:33:40
JUSTIN That's how I am and I go to Catholic school so most of us are all Catholic. I'm Catholic. 

01:33:45
SHERI BAUMAN But they're not all very kind. (inaudible ) that. 

01:33:53
JUSTIN So that's what I'm saying, same religion and stuff. You, that should be all the more reason why we're same people. 

01:33:55
SAM STEEN Yeah. I'm curious what Tahlia and what Tyler, the other Tyler, is thinking about anything we've talked about as far as today. 

01:34:10
TYLER Uh, uh, I was thinking about the whole standing up for yourself. Like, at my school, the bullies, they're always, they'll always target the little kids that they know can't stand up for themselves and, like, at my school, it seems like the bullies are always the big, like, strong guys. Like they're way overpowered over most kids. So I always feel bad because, like, it's the little kid that can't defend himself and he doesn't really have friends that can help him either. 

01:34:35
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Stick up for him. 

01:34:35
TYLER Yeah. So he kinda is just left in the dark and everyone picks on him. 

01:34:40
SAM STEEN So I'm gonna make an assumption. You're kinda caught in the middle, 'cuz you're not, it doesn't strike me as the biggest kid there but you don't look like the smallest kid either. 

01:34:45
TYLER No, I'm right in the middle. 

01:34:50
SAM STEEN So you see it happening. 

01:34:50
TYLER Yeah. 

01:34:50
SHERI BAUMAN Do you think it's only boys? You described the big guy. I'm wondering... 

01:34:55
TYLER Uh, I, it's different. Like the guys, they kinda, I don't know. They're more like physical but, like, I don't know. I've noticed like with the, with the way girls pick on each other, it's like mental and they like try to like make each other feel bad but with the guys it's just like beating each other up. 

01:35:15
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Drama. A lot of drama. So much drama. 

01:35:15
TYLER Yeah. 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:35:15
SAM STEEN You agree with that Tyler? 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:35:15
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:35:15
BRIANNA That's why I hang out with mostly guys because guys don't bring in, like... 

01:35:20
UNKNOWN Drama. 

01:35:20
BRIANNA Drama and girls at my school, they're all like crazy drama everywhere. Drama, drama, drama. And I'm totally over it so I just go hang out with guys. 

01:35:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:35:30
SAM STEEN That's very insightful, Tyler. What you said seems to resonate with a lot of people. What do you think Tahlia? 

01:35:40
TAHLIA Um, that how they pick on him because of his race, and that's horrible. 

01:35:45
SAM STEEN Oh, you're saying, say it again. 

01:35:50
TAHLIA That they pick on him because of his race. 

01:35:55
SAM STEEN Oh, you know somebody? 

01:35:55
TAHLIA No, no. I'm saying him. How it's horrible. 

01:35:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Oh. 

01:35:55
SHERI BAUMAN Now what's his name. Do you remember? 

01:36:00
TAHLIA Justin. 

01:36:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, good. 

01:36:00
SAM STEEN So how do you feel when you hear that? 

01:36:00
TAHLIA Like, like I think, like it hurts me too even though I'm not the same. 

01:36:10
SAM STEEN It hurts you that people would even still do that? 

01:36:15
TAHLIA Yeah. 

01:36:15
SHERI BAUMAN And that's, that's such, sort of the, the bottom line is that all of us recognized that, that it hurts each of us, even if we're not the one being targeted at the moment. Then, um, maybe it wouldn't happen so much. You think? So it seems like each of you feels pretty strongly, um, that these, these kinds of behaviors are harsh and unfair. Um, why do you think there's so much of it then? Are you guys like, unusual? 'Cuz we didn't pick you because you're tolerant or anything and yet you sound like you're real sensitive to that. How, how, how is it that, you know, that other kids aren't more that way? 

01:37:05
ALEJANDRA I think, like, when you have, like, problems at home, that they just wanna take it out on another person. 

01:37:10
TYLER Or social. Like they don't get along with kids. Like maybe... 

01:37:20
JUSTIN Socially inept. 

01:37:20
TYLER Yeah, like they tried getting along with kids but people just don't seem to like 'em so they turn bully and picking on people or something. 

01:37:30
BRIANNA Maybe they feel like they have to to be accepted by other people. 

01:37:30
SAM STEEN Say again Alejandra. 

01:37:35
ALEJANDRA Oh, I was gonna ask him if he could blow in my eye. I have something in my eye. 

01:37:40
SAM STEEN Oh, you have something in your eye? 

01:37:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:37:40
SAM STEEN We can try. 

01:37:40
TYLER Does it work? 

01:37:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, it does. 

01:37:45
TYLER Did it work? 

01:37:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Thank you. 

01:37:50
SAM STEEN Wow, I've never seen that before. 

01:37:50
SHERI BAUMAN Me either. 

01:37:50
SAM STEEN So you were saying that maybe they feel socially inept? Yeah. I'm sorry. I thought you said it. It was you Tyler? 

01:38:00
TYLER No. It was her. She said that. 

01:38:00
JUSTIN I said that. 

01:38:00
TYLER Or he did. 

01:38:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:38:05
SHERI BAUMAN So if you don't have social skills, one way to, um, interact with other people is to be the bully. 

01:38:10
SAM STEEN I think so. 

01:38:10
SHERI BAUMAN And they get status that way. 

01:38:15
JUSTIN Not a good status. 

01:38:15
SHERI BAUMAN No. 

01:38:15
SAM STEEN Not necessarily good though. So think back to the activity. When, there were times when some of you stood up. Maybe, there was a time where everybody was in the center. 

01:38:25
SHERI BAUMAN Tyler, did you ever get in the center? 

01:38:30
SAM STEEN Oh, candy. Candy. 

01:38:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, that's right. 

01:38:30
SAM STEEN Everybody was in. 

01:38:30
UNKNOWN Halloween's coming. 

01:38:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

01:38:35
SAM STEEN That helps. 

01:38:35
SHERI BAUMAN But Tyler, I noticed you weren't there very much with those particular categories. What was it like to sit on the outside? 

01:38:40
TYLER Left out. To see you're all different from other people. 

01:38:45
SHERI BAUMAN So it did that, huh? 

01:38:45
TYLER Mm-hmm. 

01:38:45
SAM STEEN So you felt left out but what else comes to mind. You know? Just left out today in this setting with us or left out, we talked about school a little bit. 

01:38:55
JUSTIN So you might feel left out but in your own way, you're unique. We all share those qualities and you, you don't. 

01:39:05
TYLER Like it's my, it's like the way I am compared to other people, I'm just not like other people. 

01:39:10
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:39:10
TYLER It's my own personal. 

01:39:15
SAM STEEN You're okay with that, it sounds like? 

01:39:15
TYLER Yeah. 

01:39:15
SHERI BAUMAN That's a, that's a really unique way to look at it. Instead of saying I'm left out or isolated, I'm really unique. I, you know, there's only one, uh, of me. So it sounds like we're in some ways, there are many of us who share things but in other ways, each of us is kind of unique and special. Did I cut you off? Were you about to say something? 

01:39:40
TAHLIA Mm-mm. 

01:39:40
SAM STEEN I was thinking there, when you said that part about the, um, your school is diversely mainly Hispanic. That there's smaller population of white students and how it's the reverse that you're in the minority. I found that interesting because I, I've never seen that before. I mean, I have a friend that's from Barbados and she said in her country, it's mainly black people and a few whites and so she moved to the U.S. and feels very comfortable because in her country, there are mainly black people but to hear you say that, and it sounds like it bothers you. 

01:40:10
TYLER Um, well, there's like, like I get along with 'em but there's like a certain type of group that thinks they're cool enough and they're cool with everybody else and so they have, like, their own little group of certain people. They just do whatever. 

01:40:25
SAM STEEN And in one respect discriminating or treat people a certain way because you don't fit into that group and you're, I would assume your parents are both white? 

01:40:35
TYLER Yeah. 

01:40:35
SAM STEEN That's why that was so interesting to me, because mainly we talk about white people being the majority, right and the white privilege. Have you heard of that before? White privilege? What does that mean when you hear it, Tyler? 

01:40:50
TYLER Like, uh, I don't know. 

01:40:50
SAM STEEN Well, just... 

01:40:50
TYLER White privilege? 

01:40:55
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:40:55
ALEJANDRA Sounds like... 

01:40:55
TYLER White people, like, are better, they're like more privileged and get more things or something? 

01:41:00
SAM STEEN Get more things. They don't have to work as hard. If we both go for a job interview, they may make assumptions about me that they wouldn't necessarily about him. That's called white privilege, right? 

01:41:10
TYLER Yeah. 

01:41:10
JUSTIN That's just something, I think. 

01:41:10
SAM STEEN And then he's a male, right? He's male. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. And he's a male so male white privilege even more so than even women. What were you saying Justin? 

01:41:20
JUSTIN I don't know. Just something that, just being a minority like, um, Hispanic or Latino or black, you just have to deal with that. You have to, that should make you wanna work that much harder. 

01:41:30
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:41:35
JUSTIN I mean, that's what motivates me in school, is, I don't do bad. I do okay but it, it makes me wanna work harder because all the kids at my school make honor roll and high honors and I'm always that close to making it and it, and yeah, it just wants me to make, work harder so those parents will look at me and say I'm not like that. 

01:41:55
SAM STEEN Oh, that's for making those assumptions about oh he's a, what they feel like a black man (inaudible ). 

01:42:06
JUSTIN And there's very intelligent black men like, uh, and Hispanics. Cesar Chavez. Um, Martin Luther King. Fredric Douglas. All those people. 

01:42:15
SHERI BAUMAN And all the doctors and lawyers and all those other, you know, really intelligent people. 

01:42:20
JUSTIN Like Judge Matthis and Judge Joe Brown. I know my dad watches those shows a lot. 

01:42:25
SHERI BAUMAN You know on my, um, name tag I had Kenneth Clark as one of my heroes and you may not have heard of him. He was a psychologist and he was a black man and his study, if you've ever seen it, where kids, black kids and white kids were, well particularly black kids, were asked which doll they would rather have. There were black dolls and white dolls and the black children wanted the white doll because they were better and so forth. Um, and that study led to the whole, um, Supreme Court decision to desegregate schools because it's hurtful for, and so when you talked about, you know, changing the world and making a difference, he's my hero for that reason 'cuz he did one, you know, psychology study that changed our whole country. I mean, it, it caused the Supreme Court to change, um, the law and to insist that separate but equal is not equal and we have to have education for everyone. So even though he was at a time when that wasn't easy, he really made a difference and he was kind of, he was very much my hero. 

01:43:35
SAM STEEN So we have about five minutes left, you know, and as we kinda wrap up this particular session, um, what are some other things that come to mind about what we just talked about? 

01:43:50
SHERI BAUMAN 'Cuz we brought up some pretty sensitive things, actually, and... 

01:43:55
ALEJANDRA The government. 

01:43:55
SAM STEEN What about the government? 

01:44:00
ALEJANDRA Just the government. Like the way Obama's handling some situations or issues, just like... 

01:44:10
SAM STEEN That came to mind when we were doing those things? I see. 

01:44:10
SHERI BAUMAN So you know what? You just taught me something. 'Cuz when Sam and I were planning this and looking at what categories to include I said what about politics and we, oh no. Eighth graders aren't that interested in that. So I just learned a lesson that we should not make assumptions and certainly not about this group. It's obvious that you guys are, like, highly aware and interested and I am embarrassed to admit that, because we didn't realize that. 

01:44:40
SAM STEEN What else? 

01:44:40
SHERI BAUMAN Do you feel like you got to know anybody a little better as a result of this activity? 

01:44:50
SAM STEEN No? 

01:44:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:44:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:44:50
SAM STEEN Can you share? 

01:44:55
TYLER Um, sometimes I have trouble, like putting things into words, like (inaudible ). I don't know. 

01:45:05
SHERI BAUMAN Could you try? It doesn't have to be, you know, perfect. We'll help. 

01:45:10
TYLER Um, well, at my school, there's not, like, you know, there's not too much, like, racial. Like people don't really make fun of people race all that much so it was kinda interesting to hear about Justin's experiences with it. Just kinda, you know. 

01:45:30
SAM STEEN That was new for you? 

01:45:30
TYLER Yeah. Kinda. 

01:45:30
SAM STEEN You're familiar with the bullying but not necessarily related to race. 

01:45:35
TYLER (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. Not that much. I mean, I've seen it, but it, it's not like common. 

01:45:40
SAM STEEN Is your school majority white? 

01:45:40
TYLER Um, yeah. I, I'd say it's between white and Hispanic. It's kind of both. 

01:45:50
SAM STEEN Like a mixture? 

01:45:50
TYLER Yeah. 

01:45:50
SAM STEEN Whereas his is, this Tyler's is more Hispanic in some ways. 

01:45:55
JUSTIN What... 

01:45:55
SAM STEEN That was new to me. 

01:45:55
JUSTIN What school do you, I mean, are we allowed to mention that? 

01:45:55
SAM STEEN Of course. 

01:45:55
JUSTIN What, what school do you go to? 

01:46:00
TYLER Uh, Flowing Wells. 

01:46:00
JUSTIN Oh. 

01:46:00
SAM STEEN What is it called? 

01:46:00
TYLER Flowing Wells. 

01:46:00
SAM STEEN Flowing Wells? 

01:46:00
BRIANNA And also it shows how, how strong Justin actually is to deal with it on a daily basis. You know. 

01:46:10
SAM STEEN Well you should tell him that. 

01:46:10
BRIANNA You're strong. 

01:46:15
JUSTIN Thanks. Thank you. 

01:46:15
SAM STEEN And the one who didn't say much again is Tahlia. 

01:46:20
SHERI BAUMAN But I'm very, you, you say a lot sometimes without words and the fact that you were so touched by someone else's experience to me is a big statement. I mean, about the kind of person you are. 

01:46:35
JUSTIN That's who she reminds me of. She reminds me of my mom. 

01:46:40
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, can you tell her? 

01:46:40
JUSTIN Hey, you remind me of my mom. 

01:46:40
SHERI BAUMAN And what is it about her? 

01:46:45
JUSTIN My mom, she is, she doesn't speak, like you mentioned earlier about the body language. She doesn't speak a lot but, for me having to see my mom cry, I don't like that. It makes me frustrated. It makes me mad, especially if I did something wrong and she gets frustrated. That, I just, I completely break down. I got to my room, I shut the door and I just go to sleep or something. I... 

01:47:10
SAM STEEN Because you've disappointed her. 

01:47:10
JUSTIN Yeah. I don't like that at all. 

01:47:15
SHERI BAUMAN So we can communicate in ways without words. 

01:47:15
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:47:15
SHERI BAUMAN That are pretty powerful. And I know, and I was very moved by that. 

01:47:20
SAM STEEN And Tyler, anything you wanna share before we close? 

01:47:25
TYLER I'm good. 

01:47:25
SAM STEEN You're good? Well, we appreciate the time you spend here. Um, we'll see you in one more week and you think you'll be back? 

01:47:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:47:35
SAM STEEN Okay. See you later. 

01:47:40
SHERI BAUMAN Bye. 

01:47:40
End of Session 2 

01:47:45
[sil.] 

01:47:45
Session 1 and Session 2 Processing 

01:47:50
[music] 

01:47:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I don't know about you but I was real nervous before this began and I need to remember to trust the process because these kids were really tuned in and I thought they were great. 

01:48:05
SAM STEEN Were you nervous between, um, at the very beginning or between session one and session two? 

01:48:10
SHERI BAUMAN No. At the very, very beginning. 

01:48:15
SAM STEEN Before we started the whole process. 

01:48:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. So what are your thoughts? 

01:48:20
SAM STEEN I wasn't nervous necessarily. I think I just, um, I guess I trust the process as well, you know. But also, uh, I, I tend to give kids the benefit of the doubt or give, I try to treat 'em like big people is what I'm trying to say. You know? And I think sometimes they respond to that, when you treat 'em like adults. 

01:48:40
SHERI BAUMAN So what did you think about, I, um, the activities that we used and how they responded? I certainly thought that they used the name tags to full advantage. I mean, the things they chose to disclose and even go back to because they were touched by something someone else said. 

01:48:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah. I would agree. I think that the activities are, we agree the activities are like a vehicle to have this discussion? 

01:49:05
SHERI BAUMAN Absolutely. 

01:49:05
SAM STEEN And so with them, it's helpful but at the same time, I think even if we didn't give 'em a, a notepad, you know, or whatever and we said think about your name and, you know, think about these four different elements... 

01:49:15
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:49:15
SAM STEEN I think they would get to it. It was nice to have it illustrated because they were able to probably keep track but, um, they are an amazing group, that they just really jumped right in there and having not known each other, I think there are only two kids there that know each other. 

01:49:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:49:30
SAM STEEN From before. And they literally just met each other. So those are my impressions. That they felt very comfortable very quickly. 

01:49:40
SHERI BAUMAN I agree and I thought that the depth of some of their responses was surprising. I was curious to know what you thought about, um, the emotional, um, moment with Tahlia. Um. 

01:49:55
SAM STEEN Regarding? 

01:49:55
SHERI BAUMAN Well, the first incident happened when, uh, you know, she had shared hers and and I went back because she hadn't said what it was about her mom that she, and then she just became very, very tearful. Um, to the point that we never did hear the answer. 

01:50:15
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:50:15
SHERI BAUMAN But she was quite tearful and then had that giggly laughter. 

01:50:20
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:50:20
SHERI BAUMAN But clear, very clearly touched in a way and we didn't do much with that, um, and I'm not, I, in some ways I think maybe that was the best thing to do and, but I'm curious to know what you thought about that. 

01:50:35
SAM STEEN I had mixed feelings. Um, one, we're filming it. 

01:50:35
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:50:35
SAM STEEN Two, it was the first session. Right? 

01:50:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:50:40
SAM STEEN And then three, um, she, we could have spent the whole 20 or 30 minutes sitting there asking her about it. 

01:50:50
SHERI BAUMAN I don't mean so much asking her. I meant like for example asking the group what it was like to see someone, you know, so, um... 

01:50:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Oh, I see. Yeah. I hadn't thought about that part. I think that could have been an area that, I think there was a question or two about it but we kinda moved on. Um, so again, yes we could have capitalized on it. Who knows what would have emerged but the good news is, Justin brought us back to it in the other session where he said, you know, I asked again and he kind of almost stood up for her and said she's just like my mom and that's okay and it's okay that she speaks through her body language and it's very meaningful to him or at least it impacts him in that way. 

01:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN But I, in, so that's one thing I wanna think about 'cuz I'm willing to bet you it's clear that, uh, she's easily brought to tears in, you know, just by anything that touches her. 

01:51:40
SAM STEEN You think so? Yeah. 

01:51:45
SHERI BAUMAN So I think it's important for us to recognize that. 

01:51:45
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:51:45
SHERI BAUMAN Um. 

01:51:45
SAM STEEN Yeah, easily brought to tears, emotional, but not, but when given the opportunity to, to share, she does and in a very powerful way. 

01:51:55
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:51:55
SAM STEEN You, you know what I mean? 

01:51:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I agree. So I was thinking we need to, to be sensitive. 

01:52:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Right. 

01:52:00
SHERI BAUMAN I was also surprised at how willing the kids were to delve in to some, um, pretty sticky stuff there. 

01:52:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:52:05
SHERI BAUMAN In, in the second session about race and of course Justin, um. 

01:52:10
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

01:52:10
SHERI BAUMAN Kind of took a deep dive into that. 

01:52:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Exactly. Yeah. 

01:52:15
SHERI BAUMAN And it hit everyone. 

01:52:20
SAM STEEN And I think that that's great. The, the, the alternative was he talking too much? Did you get that impression? Did he share too much? Not the depth or the, but the, the... 

01:52:30
SHERI BAUMAN Too much airtime? 

01:52:30
SAM STEEN Exactly. Too much. 

01:52:30
SHERI BAUMAN You know, um. 

01:52:35
SAM STEEN It's hard to say. 

01:52:35
SHERI BAUMAN Right. Given the composition of this group, he's the only kid with African American heritage and I think it was new information for some of the others that this isn't you know, gone. 

01:52:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. 

01:52:50
SHERI BAUMAN This happens right now. 

01:52:50
SAM STEEN All the time. 

01:52:50
SHERI BAUMAN Today at Catholic School, where kids are, um, and now that he, although he says, um, that he can deal with it. Well, he also has had fights and some other things as a result of that. So, um, I thought was, I didn't expect it to go and then it touched the others in different ways and I thought it was important for Tyler to talk about being the minority. 

01:53:15
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:53:15
SHERI BAUMAN In the building, in the, even though he's the white kid. 

01:53:20
SAM STEEN Right, exactly. 

01:53:20
SHERI BAUMAN You know. 

01:53:20
SAM STEEN Yeah. I was impressed with that. So you're right. So then we concur, in the last few second or so it's okay that if, at that moment, someone needs a little bit more airtime for the sake of others that we continue to do it? Because it didn't come across malicious. I just was thinking that other, a few people were quiet. 

01:53:40
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. And I think they, we just need to be sensitive to that and invite them to have an opportunity. The other thing I'm thinking is whether we wanna revisit what we've been thinking about for the next sessions because this group was so, um... 

01:53:50
SAM STEEN Articulate and upfront? 

01:53:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah and that we didn't have to be careful about broaching the subjects of race or religion or anything. They were just right there. 

01:54:05
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Right. Yeah. So let's take a look and if we decide to do something different the next time we process the sessions, we'll explore what they were that we thought we were gonna do but that we did differently. Is that okay? 

01:54:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. That's okay with me. 

01:54:15
SAM STEEN All right. So until next time? 

01:54:15
End of Session 1 and Session 2 Processing 

01:54:20
[sil.] 

01:54:20
Session 3 

01:54:30
[music] 

01:54:30
SHERI BAUMAN Welcome back everybody. It's nice to see everybody again and maybe since it's been a, a, a whole week since we met, I thought it would be good to check in and see what you remember or what stands out in your mind as you think about the two sessions that we've spent together. It can be something specific or something general. Just to kind of get us back in the mode. What stands out for you? 

01:54:55
TYLER Do you mean like what we talked about? 

01:55:00
SHERI BAUMAN That might be it. So what, you know, when I'm asking when you think back, what do you remember? What's... 

01:55:05
TYLER Like picking on people 'cuz of their race and stuff and like bullying. 

01:55:10
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:55:10
TYLER (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:55:11
SHERI BAUMAN Not that we did that but that we talked about that stuck in? 

01:55:11
TYLER (crosstalk) No. Yeah. 

01:55:11
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. What else? 

01:55:15
TAHLIA My emotions. 

01:55:20
SAM STEEN You remember that most is your emotions? Can you tell more? I mean, like that you got emotional? Is that what you mean? Okay. 

01:55:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Let's hear from everyone. 

01:55:35
JUSTIN Um, you know, that some people make fun of each other for their, uh, religious beliefs and things like that. 

01:55:45
SHERI BAUMAN So the discussion time, it stuck with you, looks like what you remember. Anybody else? 

01:55:50
SAM STEEN You don't have to raise your hand. 

01:55:55
TYLER Oh. How Justin's the only African American at this school. 

01:56:00
SAM STEEN So Justin being the only black person at his school? African American. That stood out for you? 

01:56:10
BRIANNA Well I liked when we learned about each other and the paper drawing thing. 

01:56:15
SHERI BAUMAN All eyes are on you Alejandra. 

01:56:25
ALEJANDRA Um, I don't remember. 

01:56:30
SHERI BAUMAN It's a blank? 

01:56:30
ALEJANDRA Kind of, yeah. 

01:56:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Well, you know what? If something comes to you, would you let us know? 

01:56:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

01:56:35
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Um, Tahlia, if it's okay, what, if it should happen that you get emotional, what would you like from us? Would you like us to give you, just give you time, move on, um, comfort you? What... 

01:56:50
TAHLIA Move on. 

01:56:55
SHERI BAUMAN Move on. Okay. And then if you're ready, you, you'll let us know? Okay, good. I'm glad that happened. Well, as we talked about getting to know each other and, and things that were interesting to learn, um, Sam and I had thought this might be a good way to do it. So what we're gonna do, each of these cards has a different beginning of a sentence and when, when it's your turn or when you volunteer, we'd like you to read that and finish it for yourself. So in other words, if Justin finished it one way, I might finish the same one very differently. So there's no, these are not right and wrong answers. Just however you would like to finish it. And then when someone does, we might wanna just react, what it was like to hear that, whether maybe it's similar for us or real different and the person might also request that but let's start by, um, just picking, pick a card, any card. 

01:57:55
TYLER Okay. 

01:57:55
SAM STEEN Do they read it yet or not yet? 

01:57:55
SHERI BAUMAN Um, yeah, why don't you save it? Just hold it. 

01:58:00
SAM STEEN You get to go first. 

01:58:00
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ). 

01:58:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. Don't read yours. 

01:58:05
TYLER So I like read the sentence and then... 

01:58:05
SAM STEEN Then finish it. 

01:58:05
TYLER Finish it? Oh, okay. 

01:58:10
SAM STEEN But not yet, not yet. 

01:58:10
TYLER All right. I have to think of something. 

01:58:10
SAM STEEN It's better if you don't read it yet because if you do read it now, you're not gonna listen to him. You'll be thinking about your own. 

01:58:15
SHERI BAUMAN Um, you wanna do, I guess Justin's next. 

01:58:15
SAM STEEN Justin's next. 

01:58:20
SHERI BAUMAN But it would be better to wait. Okay. Just, so. 

01:58:20
JUSTIN Wait, what? What am I doing? 

01:58:25
SAM STEEN Don't, just wait. You go second. 

01:58:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So do you get the idea? You're gonna finish your sentence however it fits for you and then we'll have a chance to react and respond. Okay? 

01:58:35
UNKNOWN Is is in cursive? 

01:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yes. 

01:58:35
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. 

01:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN Do you need, I, I hoped that I wrote clearly. Can you see them? Okay. So Tyler, share what. 

01:58:45
TYLER Okay. Uh, it says I wish my friends and I, I, I don't know. I wish my friends were all like my friend Mark 'cuz he's like really, like, he's kinda like a go with the flow kind of person and like he's happy doing whatever's going on and, like, he's just kind of like glad to be there and doing whatever and he's just a good person to be around. So, yeah, that's my answer. 

01:59:10
SHERI BAUMAN So you notice what I'm doing again right? 

01:59:15
TYLER Yeah. 

01:59:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:59:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Anybody else, if you had gotten that would you have answered it differently? 

01:59:25
JUSTIN I think we all would have answered it, we wanted all of them to be like our best friend. 

01:59:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah? 

01:59:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

01:59:35
SHERI BAUMAN And so his quality that you admire in him is that he's just easy going and... 

01:59:40
TYLER Yeah. 

01:59:40
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody else have a thought about your best friend and what, what you like about them? What's their most stand out quality? You wanna be if your best friend happens to be in the room, right? 

02:00:00
SAM STEEN What were you thinking Tahlia? 

02:00:05
TAHLIA Um, that she's, um, fun. 

02:00:10
SAM STEEN Your best friend is fun? 

02:00:10
TAHLIA Yeah. 

02:00:10
SAM STEEN Is this your best friend? Is that why she's smiling? 

02:00:15
JUSTIN My best friend, you know, we work out together and he always pushes me and motivates me to get better. 

02:00:25
ALEJANDRA The same with Tahlia. 

02:00:30
SHERI BAUMAN She pushes you? 

02:00:30
ALEJANDRA She motivates me to do something in life. 

02:00:35
SAM STEEN So you and Justin have that in common? A friend that motivates you? 

02:00:40
SHERI BAUMAN Tyler, was there anybody that you're curious to hear from that hasn't shared whether they have a similar view or not? 

02:00:50
TYLER Yeah. 

02:00:50
SHERI BAUMAN Who's that? 

02:00:50
TYLER The other Tyler. I'm curious about his best friend. 

02:00:55
TYLER We do a lot of the same things. We play all the same sports together. 

02:01:00
TYLER Cool. Baseball? Nice. Baseball's cool. 

02:01:10
SHERI BAUMAN You know, that reminds me. People, the, the, um, professional opinion or whatever, the scientific view of friendships is that boys tend to have friends that like the same things to do, which it sounds like, you know, have shared activities and girls, it's more sharing of, like, secrets or, um, you know, feelings and things. Do you think that's true? So girls are less concerned. Now, we, you're looking at me like maybe that doesn't quite fit. What do you think? 

02:01:45
BRIANNA Well I don't really hang out with a lot of girls because they have a lot of drama, so I usually hang out with the guys. 

02:01:50
SAM STEEN So girls have a lot of drama? And I was thinking that, some of my best friends, whether they're boys or girls, I like to tell 'em how I really feel. 

02:02:00
BRIANNA You know, and they'll bring drama like, they don't, like, go around telling lies about you and, 'cuz that happened to me before and it was kinda made me angry. So I don't talk to that person anymore. 

02:02:10
SAM STEEN And you found that more so with girls than boys? 

02:02:15
BRIANNA Yeah. I've never had a guy, like, go lying around or lying to other people. 

02:02:20
SAM STEEN Do y'all do that? 

02:02:25
TYLER No. 

02:02:25
SAM STEEN Boys? You're smiling though. 

02:02:30
JUSTIN That doesn't even come across my mind. 

02:02:30
TYLER Yeah. 

02:02:30
TAHLIA There are some guys that do though. 

02:02:35
JUSTIN (crosstalk) I don't even think about that stuff. 

02:02:35
TYLER I think it's stupid. I, I don't think they're, I think it's pointless. I don't understand. 

02:02:35
SAM STEEN You don't understand what? 

02:02:40
TYLER Why people, like, start rumors and stuff. I, I don't get it. 

02:02:45
JUSTIN That, that doesn't even come across my mind. 

02:02:45
SAM STEEN Say again? 

02:02:45
JUSTIN Doesn't even come across your mind. 

02:02:50
SAM STEEN Doesn't even cross your mind? What about girls? Do you all start rumors? I mean, you're speaking for all the women in the world, right? 

02:02:55
TAHLIA (crosstalk) I don't. 

02:02:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah, they do start rumors like... 

02:02:55
SAM STEEN They do? 

02:02:55
ALEJANDRA We, we, some girls do. 

02:03:00
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

02:03:00
ALEJANDRA 'Cuz like, they just, like, they either don't like, uh, like they don't like your personality or you're going out with their ex, which is dumb. I don't know. 

02:03:10
SAM STEEN Either they don't like, you don't like their personality or you're doing what? 

02:03:15
ALEJANDRA Like going out with their exes. They get mad. 

02:03:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Going out with their ex, like, boyfriend? 

02:03:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:03:20
TAHLIA Or if they're jealous too, sometimes. 

02:03:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:03:20
SAM STEEN Jealous about? 

02:03:25
ALEJANDRA Being prettier or smarter or something. 

02:03:25
TAHLIA Yeah. 

02:03:25
SHERI BAUMAN I noticed as they're talking about this, you guys are looking at each other. What are you thinking? 

02:03:30
SAM STEEN Taking notes. 

02:03:30
SHERI BAUMAN No, come on. 

02:03:35
JUSTIN Notes. 

02:03:35
SHERI BAUMAN What were you thinking? 

02:03:35
JUSTIN Uh, nothing. I wasn't thinking... 

02:03:40
SAM STEEN Please. You were thinking something. 

02:03:40
JUSTIN Um, there's been a lot of stuff going on. Uh, I have a girlfriend and, uh, it's been a lot of, uh, drama and I don't really deal with that. I just told her, just kinda like leave it alone. Don't even respond to some of it and... 

02:03:55
SHERI BAUMAN So you've seen this happen in your own relationships, with those kinds of things. 

02:04:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:04:00
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ). 

02:04:04
SAM STEEN Thanks for sharing. I mean, you know, that's pretty personal sharing you have a girlfriend, first of all, and second of all that there's some drama going on there. It's just sort of... 

02:04:15
ALEJANDRA Girls are not just drama queens. Guys are drama queens too. They're like... 

02:04:15
BRIANNA They just like to fight. 

02:04:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah, or they like... 

02:04:20
BRIANNA They're like, I'm stronger than you and then they start fighting, which I think is funny. 

02:04:25
JUSTIN Yeah but it's more of, like, messing around than anything 'cuz I know me and Taylor, um, we fight a lot. Like, not, not like serious fighting but we'll start wresting and stuff. He usually wins. He's, uh, he's really, he's huge. He's a freshman at South Point and he plays on varsity. Uh. 

02:04:45
SHERI BAUMAN So when you're trying to establish who's, you know, tougher, you just do it physically and girls do it maybe a little differently? 

02:04:50
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Yeah we, when we go, when we try to like wrestle in a pool, he doesn't like to do that because he can't swim. 

02:04:55
SAM STEEN So you know his weak spot? 

02:05:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:05:00
SAM STEEN I think Tyler was talking, one of the Tyler's talked about that yesterday. The way girls bully each other and the way guys bully each other. 

02:05:05
ALEJANDRA Oh yeah. 

02:05:05
SAM STEEN Do you remember who said it? 

02:05:05
ALEJANDRA I think it was him. 

02:05:05
TYLER Yeah, it was me. 

02:05:10
SAM STEEN Like physical, mental. 

02:05:10
SHERI BAUMAN So here's more evidence that our gender makes a difference in how our lives go. Justin, would you do your sentence? 

02:05:15
JUSTIN Oh yeah. Um, the thing that matters most to me is, um, right now, probably, uh, football and school. Football and school and, uh, and my girlfriend too. 

02:05:30
SAM STEEN She won't see this. Don't worry. The things that matter most to you. Football and school and girlfriend. 

02:05:40
SHERI BAUMAN Is there anybody else you'd be curious to know what they would have said had they gotten that card? 

02:05:45
JUSTIN Um, I'd be curious to see how Tyler is. He's been pretty quiet. That, that Tyler. 

02:05:50
TYLER Sports and school 'cuz without, if I don't do good in school, I can't play sports. 

02:05:55
SHERI BAUMAN So school is really... 

02:05:55
TYLER First, kind of. Like a little bit. 

02:06:00
SHERI BAUMAN That's because it leads you to sports kinda. 

02:06:05
SAM STEEN And it's the exact same thing you said. Do you have a girlfriend? 

02:06:10
TYLER No. 

02:06:10
SAM STEEN So slightly different. 

02:06:10
TYLER Yeah. 

02:06:10
SAM STEEN Probably a good idea, according to what they're talking about. 

02:06:15
SHERI BAUMAN Bri, what about you? I'm curious to know what you would have said for that. 

02:06:20
BRIANNA Sports. Not so much school 'cuz I can do school and it comes easy to me, so I don't really care. And then probably family. 

02:06:35
SHERI BAUMAN So they're up there? 

02:06:35
BRIANNA Yeah. Because without them, I wouldn't be here. Literally wouldn't be here. 

02:06:40
JUSTIN Yeah, family's pretty important. Well, it is important. It's the most important thing, I think. (crosstalk) I forgot. 

02:06:50
BRIANNA And then probably my dog's ashes. 

02:06:50
SHERI BAUMAN You have those? Do you keep them with you or... 

02:07:00
BRIANNA They're in my room. They're, I have a box, I have her collar and her ashes and a picture of her in a box and, hung up on a shelf. 

02:07:10
SHERI BAUMAN It almost sounds like an altar. 

02:07:10
BRIANNA Well, she was important, so. 

02:07:15
SHERI BAUMAN So you remember her everyday it sounds like, 'cuz it's right there. Justin, would you like to ask the next, whoever you're in the mood to hear from to do the next one? 

02:07:30
JUSTIN Um, Tyler. 

02:07:35
SAM STEEN Read it loud if you can. 

02:07:40
TYLER Something I get angry about is, um, something I get angry about is for, like, sports. I know I keep saying sports, but in sports that people get mad for no reason and when you get mad, and when you, they act like they're gonna be a professional sports player but you really have a 2% of ever being in a pro sport and it gets me angry when they get angry and it affects their playing when they can just be having fun at this age. 

02:08:15
SHERI BAUMAN And so when you are angry and that's going on, do you, how do you express that anger? 

02:08:25
TYLER I try to cheer them up, like make them get better. Like make them get happy and just play the game. Tell 'em just have fun. 

02:08:35
JUSTIN See, that's weird 'cuz it's different from me. When I play, when I'm playing football, I'll get upset at myself if I don't do something right. Um, I get, I, I, I'm really hard on myself. If I, if I miss tackle or if my dad tells me to do something and I do the, do the other thing and I, and the play goes that way it makes me frustrated. 

02:09:00
TYLER I don't, I don't like people in sports, like, when they think that they're better than everybody else and they like, they kinda like don't, I don't know. They don't, like, respect anybody and they like just go off and do their own thing. Like, they're like a one man team and they never, um, and they get like, I don't know how to explain it. Like, I just don't like people that think they're better than everybody else in sports. That's it. 

02:09:25
SHERI BAUMAN So I wanna take this to a different place and see if we can bring it into the room. How could that, how would that look here? If someone in the group look, felt like they were better than everybody else here? 

02:09:35
TYLER They'd probably, like, act like, probably wouldn't, like pay attention when you talk 'cuz they wouldn't think that it was important and they'd, like, I don't, yeah, probably just that. Like, they wouldn't care what anyone else said and, like, only like think of themselves. 

02:09:55
ALEJANDRA They would think they're better than everyone else. 

02:10:00
TYLER Yeah. 

02:10:00
SHERI BAUMAN And what's been your experience here so far? (crosstalk inaudible ) 

02:10:05
TYLER With these guys? 

02:10:05
SHERI BAUMAN Uh-huh. 

02:10:05
TYLER No. These, everyone's nice, you know. It's not like that at all. Everyone's nice and they listen and have good things to say, so yeah. 

02:10:15
SHERI BAUMAN Is there anybody, um, that was yours Tyler. IS there anybody else you'd like to hear from? 

02:10:20
TYLER Oh, I don't care. Whoever wants to go. 

02:10:25
SAM STEEN He's a team player. 

02:10:25
ALEJANDRA I'll go. 

02:10:30
SAM STEEN No, no. He's saying about the anger or about her card? 

02:10:30
SHERI BAUMAN I don't think it matters but I was thinking about the anger but, let's just... 

02:10:35
SAM STEEN What about the anger. You can tell us what happens. What does the sentence say? 

02:10:40
TYLER Something that makes me angry is... 

02:10:40
ALEJANDRA Um, um, a couple stuff. 

02:10:50
SAM STEEN So a couple things make you angry? 

02:10:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah, like liars. Liars and like two-faced people, you know? Like they act like they're one person but they're... 

02:11:05
SAM STEEN Anybody know a two faced person? 

02:11:10
JUSTIN So you want people to keep it real basically? 

02:11:10
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

02:11:15
JUSTIN Oh. 

02:11:15
SHERI BAUMAN I'm wondering. I notice we're all doing a little dancing in our chairs. What's that about? 

02:11:25
SAM STEEN I don't think they all are. Just these three. 

02:11:25
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. Well I caught myself a little bit. 

02:11:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) And maybe yourself. 

02:11:30
BRIANNA I have ADHD problems, so it's hard for me to focus without doing something else. 

02:11:35
SHERI BAUMAN Ah. So it's a way to stay... What do you do in school where you don't have, um, rotating chairs? 

02:11:45
BRIANNA That's another story. 

02:11:50
SHERI BAUMAN Ah. 

02:11:50
JUSTIN There's a student in my class, he has ADHD. He owns exercise balls. He sits on an exercise ball in class. 

02:11:55
BRIANNA (crosstalk) I usually, like, take my medicine in the morning. 

02:12:00
TYLER That's a good idea. I like that idea. 

02:12:00
SHERI BAUMAN The exercise ball? 

02:12:05
TYLER Yeah. We don't use that in my school. I don't have ADHD but there are kids and I feel bad for 'em 'cuz they, like, in class they'll be like freaking out, like, tapping desks and, like, yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell that to somebody. 

02:12:15
JUSTIN All right. 

02:12:15
ALEJANDRA To the principal? 

02:12:15
TYLER Yeah. We should give rid of all the seats. We'll use exercise balls. 

02:12:20
JUSTIN That's what they did in 5th grade at my old school. 

02:12:25
SHERI BAUMAN Really? 

02:12:25
JUSTIN They just had everybody sitting on exercise balls. 

02:12:25
TYLER That's cool. 

02:12:25
JUSTIN They were doing, like, a study. 

02:12:25
SAM STEEN So anger is, people who lie and two-faced. That causes you anger. 

02:12:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I guess. Yeah. 

02:12:40
SHERI BAUMAN So how about sharing your own card. Can you share your own card? 

02:12:45
ALEJANDRA I don't know what it says. I can't read cursive. 

02:12:50
SAM STEEN Let me see. I'm scared that dot, dot, dot. 

02:12:55
ALEJANDRA Oh wow. Um, that my boyfriend will break up with me for my best friend. 

02:13:05
SHERI BAUMAN So losing someone that's real close to you, losing that relationship would be really scary? 

02:13:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:13:10
SAM STEEN Is it just that part of it or, or the other part you added, for your best friend? 

02:13:20
ALEJANDRA Well, like, in the past, lots of guys have done that like, to her, you know? Like... 

02:13:25
SAM STEEN Oh really? It happens to Tahlia is what you said? 

02:13:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:13:25
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, I misunderstood. 

02:13:30
SAM STEEN Yeah, that's what I thought. 

02:13:30
SHERI BAUMAN I, thank you. I thought she said, you know, if my boyfriend breaks up with me or my best friend and I thought you meant... 

02:13:40
ALEJANDRA Oh, now. 

02:13:40
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, okay. You mean for your best friend. 

02:13:40
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) But she's...Yeah. 

02:13:40
SAM STEEN Exactly. 

02:13:40
TYLER That's what I thought too. 

02:13:45
SAM STEEN The for or the or? 

02:13:45
SAM STEEN No. I thought she meant, like, her boyfriend and then her best friend breaking up with her. 

02:13:50
SAM STEEN Yeah, or her best friend. 

02:13:50
TYLER Oh. 

02:13:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

02:13:54
JUSTIN (crosstalk) That's what I thought. I thought her best friend breaking up with her. 

02:13:55
TYLER (crosstalk) I thought she said her best. Yeah. 

02:13:55
SAM STEEN Maybe 'cuz I'm sitting next to her. What did you hear? 

02:13:55
BRIANNA I heard for. 

02:13:55
SAM STEEN Thank you. Me too. 

02:13:55
SHERI BAUMAN So... 

02:14:00
SAM STEEN And then the little sly look over to the side, right? 

02:14:00
SHERI BAUMAN So what's that like to have a best friend that has, um, that boys have... 

02:14:10
ALEJANDRA It's fine. I don't really, um, yeah. Just, we're all unique and she's unique to some guys. I'm unique to others. So there's nothing to be mad about or anything. 

02:14:25
SAM STEEN No, you didn't say mad, you said you were scared, though. 

02:14:25
ALEJANDRA Or, like, well, him yeah. Other guys I don't really care, but him... 

02:14:30
JUSTIN You don't want the same thing to happen, that happened to her, to you. Right? Is that what you're saying? 

02:14:40
ALEJANDRA No. 

02:14:40
JUSTIN Oh. 

02:14:40
ALEJANDRA I don't know how to explain this. Nevermind. 

02:14:40
SAM STEEN At least try. That's a good question. 

02:14:45
ALEJANDRA Um, I don't know how to explain it. Like, explain this. 

02:14:45
BRIANNA Is he different or something? 

02:14:55
ALEJANDRA What do you mean? 

02:14:55
BRIANNA Like, you like him more than you like any of the other guys or something? 

02:15:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:15:05
[sil.] 

02:15:05
SAM STEEN Can anybody relate to that relationship part? Mainly boyfriend/girlfriend I would say. You say no. 

02:15:15
TYLER Not at all. 

02:15:15
SAM STEEN Not even a little bit? 

02:15:15
TYLER No. 

02:15:15
JUSTIN I don't really go, go girl crazy. I, I have to really like the person. You know? Know what I mean? 

02:15:25
ALEJANDRA Do you go for their personality or their looks? 

02:15:30
JUSTIN Everything. 

02:15:30
SAM STEEN Which one? 

02:15:30
JUSTIN Everything. 

02:15:30
SAM STEEN Everything? 

02:15:30
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:15:30
SHERI BAUMAN Now you were very emphatic in saying no, not me. 

02:15:35
TYLER Yeah, nah. I, I don't know. I've never had girlfriends so I wouldn't understand that type of thing. 

02:15:45
SAM STEEN Consider yourself lucky. I'm just kidding. What about you Tyler? You said the same way, very emphatically. Nope. 

02:15:55
TYLER 'Cuz, like, I just don't deal with girls. Like I have friends that are girls but they're just, I don't know. Like I could never see going out with one. You know, like thinking about them all day long. 

02:16:05
SAM STEEN Because? Oh, thinking about them all day. I hear you, I hear you. 

02:16:10
SHERI BAUMAN So is that what it means to go out with someone? You have to think of them all day long? 

02:16:15
TYLER Not like them of 'em, but like, like you do, like, everything with 'em. Like you're mostly with them all the time. 

02:16:20
JUSTIN I don't do everything... 

02:16:20
BRIANNA That would annoy me. 

02:16:25
JUSTIN I don't do everything with, I don't do everything with my girlfriend. 

02:16:25
SHERI BAUMAN So his picture of what it would be like to have a girlfriend is very different than your picture? 

02:16:30
BRIANNA Yeah, if they were like next to you constantly, I'd probably get annoyed and then not talk to 'em. 

02:16:35
SAM STEEN What about you two 'cuz you two seem to be reacting to each other. 

02:16:40
TAHLIA No. 

02:16:40
SAM STEEN Do you agree with Tyler's point or do you feel like you spend a lot of time or not necessarily? 

02:16:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I spend a lot of time with my boyfriend. 

02:16:50
SAM STEEN And when you're not there, do you spend time thinking about him? 

02:16:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:16:50
SAM STEEN Yeah. What about you Tahlia? 

02:16:55
TAHLIA Um. 

02:16:55
ALEJANDRA Well we spend, like, it's like, we're Three Musketeers. It's like me, her, and him. 

02:17:00
SAM STEEN Oh. Just you three. 

02:17:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah and we have fun though. 

02:17:05
SHERI BAUMAN Let's hear some more, um, cards. Who else hasn't had a turn? 

02:17:10
TAHLIA Something people often don't understand about me is... I don't know. That I'm weird. 

02:17:20
ALEJANDRA I knew you were gonna say that. 

02:17:20
SHERI BAUMAN That you're weird how? 

02:17:25
TAHLIA Um, well that, like, I'm very religious so, like, if they say something, it offends me. 

02:17:40
ALEJANDRA Oh yeah. 

02:17:40
SAM STEEN If they say something about? What, what, what offends you? 

02:17:45
TAHLIA Like in GD. If they say GD. 

02:17:50
ALEJANDRA If they say God's name in a bad way. 

02:17:50
SAM STEEN Oh, oh, oh, oh. I see what you mean. If they say something about your religion negatively it offends you, right Tahlia? 

02:18:00
SHERI BAUMAN So if that happened in, in this group and someone one said something like that, because it, they didn't know that it mattered to you or, and they don't share that, how, how might you respond? 

02:18:10
TAHLIA I don't know. I would have said that's rude. 

02:18:15
SHERI BAUMAN So you would let them know? 

02:18:20
TAHLIA Yeah. 

02:18:20
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Because I think for me sometimes, I might not know that something I said would be, would be offensive to someone else so. 

02:18:30
SAM STEEN Do you tell other people? You do? 

02:18:30
TAHLIA Yeah. 

02:18:35
SAM STEEN The part I'm confused about is you said you feel, what is your sentence say? 

02:18:40
TAHLIA Something people often don't understand about me is... 

02:18:40
SAM STEEN And you said that I'm weird and then you said you're weird because you're religious? 

02:18:45
TAHLIA No. Well, no. No. Also 'cuz I read and they, like, say reading's dumb. 

02:18:50
SHERI BAUMAN So you're not a typical teenager. Is that what you mean? That you have different beliefs and interests? 

02:19:00
JUSTIN She's more mature. More mature. Like that? 

02:19:05
SAM STEEN You can tell her that. 

02:19:05
JUSTIN Are you more mature is what you're saying? 

02:19:05
TAHLIA Yeah, I guess. Yeah. 

02:19:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah, she is. 

02:19:10
SAM STEEN What do you think, Bri, when you hear that? Weird. Reading. Religion. 

02:19:15
BRIANNA Well I read when I get really bored but I think, like, I'd rather read like Where's Waldo or something. 

02:19:20
ALEJANDRA That's not a reading book. 

02:19:25
BRIANNA There's still, there's still words in there. 

02:19:25
TYLER Hey, it's true. You have to find stuff. 

02:19:30
BRIANNA It gets your brain thinking, so. I'm just not the type of person to sit and look at a page of notes. 

02:19:40
SHERI BAUMAN But what's it like to know, um, Tahlia started by saying that these things about her, that she's religious and that she reads a lot, makes her a little weird compared to maybe other kids her age. What about you guys? Does that seem, I mean, how do you respond to that? 

02:19:55
BRIANNA It's not weird to me. 

02:19:55
SAM STEEN You should tell her that. 

02:20:00
BRIANNA It's not weird to me. 

02:20:00
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody else? What's it, what's it like to hear that? 

02:20:05
TYLER I don't think it's weird. I go to church every Sunday and I read. So. 

02:20:15
SHERI BAUMAN So is that surprising? 

02:20:20
TAHLIA A little bit. 

02:20:20
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) That there are other kids. Yeah? 

02:20:20
TAHLIA Yeah. 

02:20:20
SHERI BAUMAN Thanks. 

02:20:25
SAM STEEN Did you ask, one more. I mean, you asked, your, your question was was that surprising. What other feelings come to mind when you hear other people say those things? 

02:20:35
TAHLIA Not, I don't know. Like, uh, I don't know. Like they just go to church every Sunday. 

02:20:45
JUSTIN I go to church on Thursdays with my school. 

02:20:50
TYLER Yeah. Yeah, 'cuz Catholic school's, you go to Catholic school, right? 

02:20:55
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:20:55
TYLER They go to church during the week. I almost went to a Catholic school once. 

02:21:00
ALEJANDRA Are you guys all Catholic? 

02:21:05
JUSTIN I'm Catholic. 

02:21:05
TYLER Yeah, so am I. 

02:21:05
BRIANNA So am I. 

02:21:05
SAM STEEN You are too? You are too? 

02:21:10
TAHLIA Yeah. 

02:21:10
ALEJANDRA Everyone is. 

02:21:10
SAM STEEN Did you know that everybody in here was Catholic? 

02:21:15
TAHLIA No. I just knew he is. 

02:21:15
SAM STEEN Just Justin? I understand. 

02:21:20
SHERI BAUMAN So it sounds like, if I can interpret it, sometimes we think we're unusual or weird in some way because we really don't know much about other people and then you find out, oh. 

02:21:30
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

02:21:30
SHERI BAUMAN So it sounds like a little of that. So thanks for sharing that. That gave us the opportunity to say there are others who share that. Who hasn't had a turn to share a card? Would you do that? 

02:21:45
BRIANNA The best birthday I ever has was probably my 13th birthday 'cuz my, my real father came and my family came down from Pennsylvania and California. So everyone was there and I got to go over to my dad's house, which I hadn't done in like seven years, something like that. 

02:22:10
SHERI BAUMAN So what made it special was the people who came for that occasion? 

02:22:15
JUSTIN What was the question? 

02:22:20
BRIANNA The best birthday I ever had. 

02:22:25
JUSTIN Oh. 

02:22:25
ALEJANDRA Um, are you gonna share yours? 

02:22:30
JUSTIN You can go ahead. 

02:22:30
ALEJANDRA Um, like, we did a little birthday party and we went to the hospital, 'cuz my sister was pregnant and she had a virus, so, like, they were trying to fix her and stuff and then we went back home and then the next day, like in the, like really early in the morning, I had to go back and my niece was born. So it's like right after my birthday. 

02:22:55
SHERI BAUMAN So was she your birthday present sort of? 

02:23:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. The little demon. She was born on Friday the 13th. 

02:23:05
SHERI BAUMAN And is she important to your life still? 

02:23:15
ALEJANDRA Yes. I consider her my daughter since I'm always, like, taking care of her and just always with her. 

02:23:20
SHERI BAUMAN So your sister must be quite a bit older than you. 

02:23:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah. She's 22, 23, 21. 

02:23:30
SHERI BAUMAN So you get to help and be with your niece? 

02:23:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah, she's irresponsible, so yeah. I'm mostly with the baby. 

02:23:40
SHERI BAUMAN Is there anybody's card we haven't heard? No? What was it like to do this? The idea was to find another way to learn something about ourselves and other people. What, what struck you about this? 

02:24:00
ALEJANDRA What like surprised us when we found out? 

02:24:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, that's one way to answer it. Uh-huh. 

02:24:05
ALEJANDRA That he has a girlfriend. 

02:24:05
SHERI BAUMAN And that surprising or just interesting? 

02:24:10
ALEJANDRA It's surprising 'cuz, like, he's into sports and I would expect him, just like sports, sports, sports, sports. Not sports or girlfriend. You know? Like some guys are. They don't have the time for a girlfriend. Like Tyler. 

02:24:25
JUSTIN She's, she's very supportive. Like, she comes to my games and stuff and we, we both like, she likes to watch football and stuff, so kinda incorporates. 

02:24:35
SAM STEEN So what is it like to hear her say that she was surprised you had a girlfriend? 

02:24:40
JUSTIN Mm-mm. My parents were surprised when I told them. Same thing. 

02:24:45
SHERI BAUMAN Surprised and, and was that okay or? 

02:24:50
JUSTIN Yeah. They, they were fine with it. They just wanted to meet her and stuff. They're fine with it. 

02:24:55
ALEJANDRA So your parents like her? 

02:25:00
JUSTIN Yeah, they think she's pretty cool. 

02:25:00
TYLER I thought it was cool that Tahlia said that, uh, she thinks she's weird but then everyone else is like her so I guess that everyone's weird. That was a good experience and goes to church and stuff and is religious, so I guess we're all. 

02:25:25
SHERI BAUMAN And it could be many other things, huh, that sometimes we have that feeling that I'm the only one I know, and then we find out oh. 

02:25:35
TYLER Yeah. 

02:25:35
SHERI BAUMAN Not always. But we don't find out if we don't speak up. 

02:25:40
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Ask. 

02:25:40
SHERI BAUMAN I'm sorry? 

02:25:40
TAHLIA If we don't ask. 

02:25:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. Or if you don't share it with yourself. You know, this is something about me that maybe you might not understand and they say actually I understand because I, I'm the same. Anything else that surprised you, that struck you? Was this a good activity to get, um, acquainted? It seemed to me that the energy was a little low. Did you feel that? 

02:26:05
JUSTIN I think it was just early in the morning. 

02:26:10
SAM STEEN You said it's just early in the morning? 

02:26:10
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:26:10
SAM STEEN No I didn't feel like the energy is low. I think, um, I'm just curious if you all, um, sort of aren't saying something that you're thinking. That there was a time where you wanted to say something but you held back. Did that happen? 

02:26:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:26:30
SAM STEEN Yes? Anybody else? Were you, you know, somebody said something, you were thinking something but you kinda held back? 

02:26:35
SHERI BAUMAN So, Ale, um, without telling us what it is, what held you back? What kept you from saying what you were thinking about? 

02:26:45
ALEJANDRA Me being different from them. If that makes any sense. 

02:26:50
SAM STEEN Um, maybe if you shared what it is that you held back. 

02:26:55
ALEJANDRA That they're all Catholic. 

02:26:55
SAM STEEN That's the part you held back? 

02:27:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. It's just... 

02:27:00
SAM STEEN You're not Catholic? 

02:27:05
ALEJANDRA No. 

02:27:05
SAM STEEN Oh, that's what you're saying. That's the difference. 

02:27:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:27:05
SAM STEEN Oh, you're the only one who's not Catholic. 

02:27:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:27:10
JUSTIN What's your religion? 

02:27:10
SAM STEEN Hmm? 

02:27:10
JUSTIN What's her, I'm asking her what's her religion. 

02:27:15
ALEJANDRA I don't know yet. I don't know. I'm not really religious. My mom's Christian but I mean, we all find out what we believe in, like, later in life. Like my sister. She's turning Muslim. My other sister's Catholic. And yeah, and I'm just, I don't know. 

02:27:40
SHERI BAUMAN Still deciding, huh? (inaudible ). 

02:27:44
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

02:27:44
SHERI BAUMAN So you said you held that back because it, it was different and, but now that you've shared, what would you like from the group? What do you wanna know from them? 

02:27:50
ALEJANDRA Why, like, why are you guys Catholic? Because of your parents or you believe in it? 

02:28:00
TYLER My parents. That's why I'm Catholic. My mom's Catholic and my dad's not. My dad really wasn't religious and when they got married, you know, my whole family... 

02:28:10
JUSTIN It's exact, exact same thing with me. 

02:28:10
TYLER Yeah. My whole family's just... 

02:28:15
JUSTIN My dad's Baptist. 

02:28:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Your dad was, your mom was Catholic. 

02:28:15
TYLER Yeah. 

02:28:15
SAM STEEN Your, your dad was really that religious. They got married and so he starting practicing Catholicism. 

02:28:25
TYLER Mm-hmm. 

02:28:25
SAM STEEN But you said that's the exact same thing? 

02:28:25
JUSTIN No. No, no, no. I, I got mixed up. My dad is Baptist. He just doesn't go to church that much and so we decided to make me and my sister Catholic and I'm being confirmed this year, so. 

02:28:35
SAM STEEN So your mom was Catholic and she goes to church more often, so you all started going with her? 

02:28:45
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. And now my dad's going but he's still Baptist. 

02:28:45
SAM STEEN Were you gonna say something?1 

02:28:50
TYLER My dad's, like, my dad's side of the family is Catholic and (inaudible ) and so, because my mom's not so religious. So it's just me and my dad that goes to church usually. 

02:29:00
SHERI BAUMAN So it sounds like sometime it's the, particularly you asked whether it's the parents, it sounds like... 

02:29:05
SAM STEEN In these three cases, it's the parents. 

02:29:05
SHERI BAUMAN Parents and their, or the parent that has stronger beliefs maybe that has helped with his choice. 

02:29:15
ALEJANDRA What about you? 

02:29:15
BRIANNA My nana raised me Catholic because she was a Catholic. My parents weren't really around, so... 

02:29:20
ALEJANDRA And you, Tahlia? 

02:29:25
TAHLIA Well, at first it was my mom, like, ever since I was little and then, and then I grew to like it so like I chose that for myself, too. 

02:29:40
SHERI BAUMAN That's pretty neat that you felt like you, even though it was, you shared your mom's choice, it was more conscious as you got older. That at first you were just doing it to please her but then it became important to you. 

02:29:55
SAM STEEN Is that how it happened for you two as well? Like do you feel now, like, you're just going with your dad or you're, oh, also for you? 

02:30:05
TYLER Yeah, I believe in it. 

02:30:05
SAM STEEN You believe in it as well? 

02:30:05
TYLER Yeah. For me, like, on Sunday's, you know, I, I don't really wanna get up out of bed and go to church but I always like get there and then, when I get there... 

02:30:15
SAM STEEN Feel better. 

02:30:15
TYLER Yeah. I, I feel like, I don't know. I just, I always feel like more relaxed once I'm there. 

02:30:20
SHERI BAUMAN So, I'm wondering, to close today, since we've now met three times, to kinda think about the other people in the group and, if there's something that you appreciated or liked or admired, um, this would be a good chance to say, you know, thanks or just I liked that or I appreciated when or something. So maybe if, if each of you could think about something that you'd like to acknowledge someone else in the room, um, directly and we can practice talking to them instead of to us. Um, I think it might be a nice way to end today. 

02:31:05
SAM STEEN I agree. And also use the person's name if you don't mind. That would, look at them. Say their name. 

02:31:10
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Bri, I like the way... 

02:31:10
SAM STEEN Say it a little louder, too, so we can all hear. 

02:31:15
ALEJANDRA I like the way you, like, really love your dog. You know, like, you, how do I say this? Um, do you understand what I'm saying, right? Yeah. 

02:31:25
TYLER I like the fact that Alejandra admitted that she... 

02:31:30
SHERI BAUMAN Tell her. 

02:31:30
TYLER I like the fact that you, Alejandra, admitted the fact that, like, you're not the same religion as everybody else and, you know, you weren't like afraid. Yeah. 

02:31:40
TYLER I liked how Tahlia said she wasn't, she wasn't afraid to say that she likes reading. 

02:31:50
SAM STEEN Can you say that directly to her? 

02:31:55
TYLER I like how you said you weren't, how, like, you weren't afraid to say you liked it. 

02:32:05
[sil.] 

02:32:05
BRIANNA I like the fact that we all get along. 

02:32:05
SHERI BAUMAN So it's more general, that it feels comfortable. 

02:32:15
JUSTIN Excuse me. 

02:32:20
SHERI BAUMAN Can you acknowledge someone Justin? 

02:32:25
JUSTIN Um, like how both Tylers are real go with the flow. Yeah. 

02:32:30
TYLER That's good. I'm glad you said that 'cuz I want to be a go with the flow person. 

02:32:35
SHERI BAUMAN Is it a challenge sometimes? 

02:32:40
TYLER Yeah, sometimes but I guess you just have to deal with it and... 

02:32:45
SAM STEEN Go with the flow. 

02:32:45
TYLER Yeah. 

02:32:45
SHERI BAUMAN That's Sam and I conversation pretty often 'cuz Sam is, is, you may, Sam is much more go with the flow than I am and I'm very much would like to be that way. What about you, Tahlia? 

02:33:05
TAHLIA Um, I liked how Tyler, you, that he said that he goes to church on Sunday 'cuz I go to church every Sunday. 

02:33:15
SHERI BAUMAN So I wanna acknowledge all of us for, for whom that's important, that you came today. So it, it, it makes it doubly valuable that you, uh, were willing to do this even though that's a, a day that's set aside for something important in your life. 

02:33:35
SAM STEEN And I concur with, um, Tyler about Alejandra saying that thing that maybe you didn't wanna say at first? 

02:33:45
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

02:33:45
SAM STEEN And then sharing, 'cuz it's helpful. I believe. I don't know if you don't feel like it's helpful, but I feel like it's helpful that you do more of that and if you feel like something crosses your mind that you kinda wanna say but you hold back, just take a chance and say it because it may not just be beneficial to you, right? It sounds like it also benefited you to hear that, too. Would you agree with that? 

02:34:05
TYLER Mm-hmm. 

02:34:05
SHERI BAUMAN And I think that, um, at least from what I hear from everybody is that this group feels pretty safe, so if you say something and it comes out wrong, anyone doesn't, it, we can manage that and if someone's feelings are hurt, hopefully they would say so, so the other person can learn but, um, I have a very good feeling about that. So we're about to finish for today. Any last minute, oh, I'll regret that I didn't say that before we go? 

02:34:40
SAM STEEN Was it okay that we did an activity where you do a little bit more talking than coloring and drawing? 

02:34:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:34:50
SAM STEEN Y'all okay with that? 

02:34:50
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:34:50
SHERI BAUMAN Which doesn't mean we might not do some coloring and drawing some other times but good. 

02:35:00
SAM STEEN Well which would you prefer? 

02:35:00
JUSTIN The speaking. 

02:35:00
TYLER Yeah, like. 

02:35:00
SAM STEEN Without the coloring and the drawing? 

02:35:00
TYLER Yeah, I'm not much of a colorer or drawer. 

02:35:05
SAM STEEN What about you three? 

02:35:05
TAHLIA I like to color. 

02:35:05
SHERI BAUMAN You do? 

02:35:05
SAM STEEN You? 

02:35:05
ALEJANDRA Speak. 

02:35:10
BRIANNA I don't care. 

02:35:10
SAM STEEN You don't care? 

02:35:10
SHERI BAUMAN Well, okay. We'll do a little of both. 

02:35:10
SAM STEEN So I guess it's a little bit of both. Can you handle both (inaudible )? 

02:35:18
TYLER Sure. 

02:35:18
SAM STEEN Okay. Thanks. So we'll see you next week. 

02:35:20
JUSTIN Okay. 

02:35:20
End of Session 3 

02:35:25
[sil.] 

02:35:25
Session 3 Processing 

02:35:30
[music] 

02:35:30
SHERI BAUMAN So, I don't know what's on your mind but there are three things I wanted to ask you about. That the incident with Tahlia, at first when she mentioned being emotional and I asked her about that. Do you think that was helpful? Was it, um, highlighting something that she was embarrassed about or? I was just wondering what you thought about that. 

02:35:55
SAM STEEN My reaction is that it was a great question. We, I think we talked about it when we processed after the second session that we didn't know what to do. You know, kinda caught, it caught me off guard the first time she cried and she got teary eyed the second time as well. So the fact that you asked her I think is helpful. That was she could pick and choose how she wanted to react to it and, um, so I think it was appropriate. The only other thing is we didn't have the other people agree is that okay. You know? So you heard what Tahlia, anybody, but it, it doesn't matter. She, she (crosstalk inaudible ). 

02:36:33
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, if it happens again maybe we can ask the others how, how it is for them to notice that. That was, yeah. 

02:36:35
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Exactly. How was that like, you know. 

02:36:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. And also, you know, she and, um, Alejandra obviously... 

02:36:40
SAM STEEN Know each other well. 

02:36:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

02:36:45
SAM STEEN I didn't know they knew each other that well. 

02:36:45
SHERI BAUMAN I didn't either. 

02:36:45
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

02:36:45
SHERI BAUMAN I thought they perhaps they'd gone to the same school. 

02:36:50
SAM STEEN Right, and were friends but not sharing boyfriends. 

02:36:50
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. Well, that's, that's the least of it. 

02:36:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) You know what I mean? 

02:36:55
SHERI BAUMAN There's a dynamic though of sub-grouping going on. How can, how do you think we can best manage that? 

02:37:00
SAM STEEN I thought about it the other day, that, if they sit closer to each other but can't see each other maybe because they literally feed off each other with the non-verbal cues the whole time. 

02:37:10
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. 

02:37:10
SAM STEEN And unfortunately, I believe it impacts Tahlia more than Alejandra, if that makes any sense. 

02:37:15
SHERI BAUMAN I agree. 

02:37:15
SAM STEEN Alejandra still talks. Tahlia waits for approval, in my head before she moves forward and says anything. You see what I mean? 

02:37:25
SHERI BAUMAN And I, yeah, and I see Tahlia as maybe more thoughtful so, but both of them seem to require... 

02:37:30
SAM STEEN Each other's sort of support. 

02:37:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. So maybe that's, let's try that as a strategy. 

02:37:40
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) What are we trying? 

02:37:40
SHERI BAUMAN Having them sit together. 

02:37:40
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. Whoa. Not, not right next to each other, but just enough so that it, it'd be very obvious that they'd have to turn and look over at each other because... 

02:37:45
SHERI BAUMAN Like if Alejandra was where, uh, Joanne was today. I mean Justin. 

02:37:50
SAM STEEN Maybe that way or, you know, like one person in between. 

02:37:55
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Anyway, let's pay attention to that. 

02:37:55
SAM STEEN Yeah. I agree. 

02:37:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

02:37:55
SAM STEEN What was the third thing? 

02:38:00
SHERI BAUMAN Um, actually it was (inaudible ), um, let me think. Oh, just as they were leaving and I said oh, I had all these cards left that we didn't get to do and, um, you know, just chit chat and they said well you guys didn't do them today. 

02:38:15
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. 

02:38:15
SHERI BAUMAN So, and that was deliberate on our part. 

02:38:15
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. 

02:38:15
SHERI BAUMAN How do you, do you think, um, as we back off from being actively engaged in the activities that it's helpful to talk about it with them or wait for them to bring it up in the group? 

02:38:30
SAM STEEN I don't know. Either one because I heard the comment as well. So I think that... 

02:38:35
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) It's always a judgment call. We, we participate kind of to model and, um, but I don't, I, I wanna keep the roles clear and to make it about them. 

02:38:45
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah, I agree. Sure. I would say that, you know, the, the point of us doing it is for modeling, not for our own benefit. If they or if they're curious, I believe they'll ask. 

02:39:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, okay. So then... 

02:39:00
SAM STEEN We can ask would you prefer us to or not. It, it depends on, we can either just let them ask if they're that curious. 

02:39:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I, I kinda prefer to do that. 

02:39:10
SAM STEEN As opposed to us asking them would you like us... 

02:39:10
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

02:39:10
SAM STEEN Because of course they're gonna say yes. 

02:39:15
SHERI BAUMAN Right. Exactly. 

02:39:15
SAM STEEN I got ya. Yeah. I'll agree with that. 

02:39:15
SHERI BAUMAN And the last thing is the chairs that I would like to nail still. Um, did you think it was a distraction? 

02:39:20
SAM STEEN No, I think it's real. I mean, if we were in a group in a school with (crosstalk inaudible ). 

02:39:30
SHERI BAUMAN Well just if the chairs didn't rotate. I mean, I would... 

02:39:30
SAM STEEN Yeah, but they do rotate. There's nothing you can do about it. 

02:39:35
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

02:39:35
SAM STEEN I, distraction in how? In terms of the process or just you thinking through stuff? 

02:39:35
SHERI BAUMAN I think in terms of the process. Was it a distract, did it keep, keep the focus away. 

02:39:45
SAM STEEN It's not a distraction. In, well, in my, in my thought is that it's not a distraction, it's, um, Bri said I need it in order to stay focused. Alejandra may do it, I'm making an assumption, because it makes her feel comfortable because even when she shares, she's still rocking back and forth. 

02:40:00
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

02:40:00
SAM STEEN Had we forced them to sit still, what sort of anxiety might be... 

02:40:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, no, I know that there's no way to force them to sit still but I'm wonder, I was wondering whether you thought it was a distraction. 

02:40:15
SAM STEEN Oh, not at all. No. I don't because I do it too. I really do. 

02:40:15
SHERI BAUMAN Not quite as much as they do. 

02:40:20
SAM STEEN No, I, I've learned how to manage it, you know. But I do things with my hands or my mom, when I was a kid, she let me chew gum in school but I, I had to hide it from the teacher. 

02:40:30
SHERI BAUMAN Ah. 

02:40:30
SAM STEEN So I recognize it. Some of those things you have to learn how to manage. The only response I have, thought that I have in this session was you asked about the energy level. 

02:40:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

02:40:35
SAM STEEN What were you worried or concerned about or what were you thinking because they were quieter or... 

02:40:45
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) I was just wondering, they, just, um, my observation was that they were a little bit less engaged, even though they said they liked the talking things. Um, not all of them but I found it was harder for them, I thought, just looking at non-verbals, to listen as closely as they seemed to. Um, but we're meeting earlier today so maybe that's the issue and now they'll have some sugar and... 

02:41:10
SAM STEEN Right. My thought is that it's, that they were slow to progress but it wasn't, I didn't get the impression lack of engagement. I got the impression that, for anybody to sit still for 40 minutes and to have an, an adult-like conversation is challenging. You know? Um, we could bring things in where they would be interacting and, and doing cartoons or, I'm sorry, coloring, etc. but it would detract from sort of the content. So although they didn't seem engaged, the, I... 

02:41:40
SHERI BAUMAN I don't, yeah, I don't, I wouldn't say I didn't see them engage. I didn't see as engaged. The other... 

02:41:45
SAM STEEN Thing is... 

02:41:45
SHERI BAUMAN Um, I hope, I would like them to do some of, and they're beginning to, I think, speaking to each other, not needing a prompt, those kinda things. So maybe we can pay attention to that. 

02:42:00
SAM STEEN Right. I think we're encouraging that and over, and some of 'em do. 

02:42:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

02:42:00
SAM STEEN But back to the, um, engagement. So maybe we're just misunderstanding, is that, that I feel like they were engaged. 

02:42:10
SHERI BAUMAN Oh good. 

02:42:10
SAM STEEN They were quieter, a little bit more slow to speak but they were definitely still thoughtful. You can tell by the responses that they had. So in light of, you know, sort of the energy level, whether or not they're talking to each other, sort of the sense that we have so far, how do you think we should move forward? 

02:42:25
SHERI BAUMAN I actually think the activity we had with the, the strengths activity, but using the incidents, um, would be a good combination of some of them will get to color but it's not anything they're gonna share. Just use it as a place to think. Um, and then asking them to directly not the strengths and then take turns. So we need to, I think my only concern is that we need to not give them too, too much time to about their three things because we want... 

02:42:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) I see. We can tell 'em explicitly, you'll have six or seven minutes or five minutes and then point 'em to the clock so they can keep time. 

02:43:05
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right, right. And then, and theoretically if they really are very meaningful, important events in their life, it shouldn't be that hard to think of them, right? 

02:43:10
SAM STEEN Yeah. And we can just take our time along the way. 

02:43:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

02:43:15
SAM STEEN Okay. That sounds like a plan. 

02:43:15
SHERI BAUMAN Good. 

02:43:15
SAM STEEN All right. Till next time, huh? 

02:43:20
End of Session 3 Processing

[sil.] 

02:43:25
Session 4 

02:43:30
[music] 

02:43:30
SHERI BAUMAN So welcome back everybody. Since, um, we haven't seen each other for a bit, I thought it might be nice to start with kind of a high point of our week. 

02:43:45
SAM STEEN God bless. 

02:43:45
SHERI BAUMAN Something, you know, kind of the best thing that's happened in the last week and, um, just to make it even easier, if you can't think of something that stands out for you as a high, make one up and we won't know the difference. So, um, just think of something positive that's happened in the last week, just to get us on a, hearing everybody's voice before we start. 

02:44:10
TYLER Oh, okay. My, I'll say something. My friend, my friend came over to my house and he stayed over and we got to play video games and hang out and it was a lot of fun, so, yeah. 

02:44:25
SHERI BAUMAN Way cool. Thank you. 

02:44:25
ALEJANDRA Oh, like our weekend, like... 

02:44:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah or week since we met. 

02:44:30

SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

02:44:35
ALEJANDRA I saw a baby be delivered. 

02:44:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ooh. Like real live in person, not on a video. 

02:44:45
ALEJANDRA Yes. It was amazing. 

02:44:45
SHERI BAUMAN I have yet to see that, real life. 

02:44:45
ALEJANDRA Really? 

02:44:45
SHERI BAUMAN Mm-hmm. 

02:44:45
ALEJANDRA It's, like, so beautiful, like. 

02:44:50
TYLER That doesn't sound beautiful. 

02:44:55
TAHLIA It sounds (inaudible ). 

02:44:57
TYLER Yeah. You'd be like recording, like the baby's birth but I don't even like know why you wanna go back and like watch that. (inaudible ). 

02:45:04
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

02:45:04
SAM STEEN You mean the recording of your birth? 

02:45:05
TYLER No, no. I'm talking, like, like... 

02:45:05
ALEJANDRA When you're older? 

02:45:05
TYLER Yeah. Like I heard, uh, this one, like, football player, he had recorded his baby being born before the game started 'cuz like, yeah. But I don't know. I, I just thought that was weird. 

02:45:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah, they did let me record though and I saw everything. 

02:45:20
SHERI BAUMAN Well, that must be memorable. 

02:45:25
ALEJANDRA It was. It was... 

02:45:25
SHERI BAUMAN It's gonna be a hard one to top. Most of us don't do that in the course of a week. Someone else? High point? 

02:45:30
BRIANNA I pitched a no hitter. 

02:45:35
SHERI BAUMAN Ooh. 

02:45:35
SAM STEEN Wow. 

02:45:35
BRIANNA In softball, not baseball. 

02:45:35
SHERI BAUMAN Good for you. 

02:45:40
TYLER (crosstalk) That's impressive. 

02:45:40
SAM STEEN What'd you say Tyler? That's impressive, right? 

02:45:40
JUSTIN Um, we had a football game and we won 26 to six. 

02:45:50
ALEJANDRA Wow. 

02:45:50
JUSTIN And I had a safety and a 30 yard run. 

02:45:55
ALEJANDRA What's a safety. I don't know nothing about football. 

02:45:55
JUSTIN Um, when, it's just they're in the end zone, the other team's in their end zone, um, and, well, our end zone and then if you tackle them in the end zone, it's two points. 

02:46:10
ALEJANDRA Oh, okay. 

02:46:10
TYLER It's like a reverse touchdown, kinda. 

02:46:15
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:46:15
ALEJANDRA Oh, okay. 

02:46:15
SHERI BAUMAN So it's good for your side, not matter what. 

02:46:15
TYLER It's like a touchdown for the defense. 

02:46:15
SAM STEEN Yeah, that's a good way of saying it. Touchdown for the defense. 

02:46:20
TYLER Yeah. 

02:46:20
SHERI BAUMAN There you go. 

02:46:20
TAHLIA I went to Valley of the Moon. Have you ever been to that place? 

02:46:25
SHERI BAUMAN Uh-uh. 

02:46:25
TAHLIA It's like, I don't know what it is. It's like a park, I guess, but it's like magical. 

02:46:35
SHERI BAUMAN On purpose? 

02:46:35
TAHLIA Yeah. 

02:46:35
ALEJANDRA Is it like the magical festival? 

02:46:40
TAHLIA No, it's like a tour, a tour. There's like a path. SO you go and you wait and then, like the people come in there acting it out. 

02:46:50
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

02:46:50
TAHLIA Like, it's so cool. 

02:46:50
SHERI BAUMAN I think so. It sounds like great fun. Did you go with someone else? 

02:46:55
TAHLIA I went with my mom and my brother and sister. 

02:47:00
SHERI BAUMAN Good. 

02:47:00
ALEJANDRA It's your turn (crosstalk inaudible ). 

02:47:04
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) I'll have to put it on my list of things to do. 

02:47:05
ALEJANDRA Tyler, would you like to share? 

02:47:05
TYLER Um, I hit an inside the park homerun in my baseball game and I went, and we won one out of two games. 

02:47:15
SHERI BAUMAN Very good. 

02:47:15
SAM STEEN Is that everybody? 

02:47:20
SHERI BAUMAN I think so. We have an activity that we're gonna do but is there anything on someone's mind they would like to talk about before we do that? 

02:47:25
ALEJANDRA What did you guys do? 

02:47:25
SAM STEEN Say again? 

02:47:30
ALEJANDRA What did, what about you guys? You guys didn't share. 

02:47:30
SAM STEEN You wanna go first? You wanna go? 

02:47:35
SHERI BAUMAN Well I'm gonna go and I could answer for both of us 'cuz we went together to a, um, art gallery, museum, interesting place that I'd never in a, really realized was here in Tuscon and it was really cool. I mean, the art was cool. The guy's story, you know, there were news articles and different things about him. He was a very interesting man and then I loved the way the buildings were done and the chapel and, so that, that was my high point. 

02:48:05
SAM STEEN I would say mine is that the weather's so nice here 'cuz in D.C., it's already getting cold. 

02:48:10
ALEJANDRA You like warm places? 

02:48:15
SAM STEEN I love warm places. 

02:48:15
ALEJANDRA Oh, my god. I hate the heat. 

02:48:15
SAM STEEN It's cold. 

02:48:20
ALEJANDRA I wish I was in D.C. 

02:48:20
TYLER It's not warm here though. It's just hot. 

02:48:20
SAM STEEN I like hot. 

02:48:25
TYLER It's just hot. It's not like warm. It's just like ridiculously hot. 

02:48:25
BRIANNA I'd rather it be like snow because I can lay in snow in like shorts and a tank top and it won't bother me. 

02:48:35
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

02:48:35
SAM STEEN Well, I don't know if it was last year or two years ago, it was like 24 inches. I don't think you'd be laying anywhere but in your house. 

02:48:40
BRIANNA It wouldn't bother me. 

02:48:40
ALEJANDRA Oh, when it snowed here? 

02:48:45
SAM STEEN It snowed in D.C. 

02:48:45
ALEJANDRA Oh, okay. 

02:48:45
SAM STEEN There's snow here too? 

02:48:45
ALEJANDRA Oh, it snowed here too. 

02:48:45
JUSTIN (crosstalk) It snowed here last year. Just a little. 

02:48:45
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) No, not last year. It was when I was in 3rd grade. So, so it was like... 

02:48:50
JUSTIN I don't, it snowed last year up in, um, Oak Valley in the morning... 

02:48:55
TYLER (crosstalk) In the morning. 

02:48:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:48:55
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) What year was that? 

02:48:55
SHERI BAUMAN Snow here, Sam, it isn't like you know snow. It's another... 

02:49:00
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Yeah, it's only like a little bit. 

02:49:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. A really little. 

02:49:00
TYLER It was like covering the rocks, like the dirt. 

02:49:05
SAM STEEN Do you cancel school? 

02:49:05
TYLER No. 

02:49:05
JUSTIN (crosstalk) No. 

02:49:05
BRIANNA Well, on, in 3rd grade we did. We got to cancel school. 

02:49:10
SAM STEEN Because of the snow? 

02:49:10
JUSTIN Oh yeah, I remember that. 

02:49:10
BRIANNA Yeah. 

02:49:10
JUSTIN Yeah, me too (inaudible[02:49:16). 

02:49:15
BRIANNA 'Cuz that's the day I broke my basketball hoop because I was throwing the ball at it and it shattered. 

02:49:20
SAM STEEN Because it was frozen. 

02:49:20
TYLER That's funny. 

02:49:20
BRIANNA It was fun. 

02:49:25
SAM STEEN I do like warm weather though. Okay, so today, this is about finding strengths in other people. I don't know if that makes any sense but what you're gonna do is, I'm gonna give you a notebook and in your notebook, you're gonna write three events that you feel like were significant in your life. Three situations that occurred. You can describe them any way you want to. You can draw a picture about it or you can write them down. Whatever's easiest. 

02:49:50
SHERI BAUMAN And you're gonna talk about them, so even if it's, I mean, you don't have to write out every little word like you were gonna publish it. Just notes for yourself. 

02:50:00
JUSTIN (crosstalk) So you can... 

02:50:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, just kind of a memory aid for yourself when you talk about it. 

02:50:05
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Some notes. But three of them, okay? Alejandra and then you're gonna pick one that you wanna share with the group. 

02:50:10
ALEJANDRA Oh, okay. 

02:50:10
SAM STEEN Okay? So three but only pick one that you're gonna share. So that's the first part and I'll tell you the second part when we get to that part. Now help each other out because try to go ahead and do the same notebook. 

02:50:25
JUSTIN This is yours. 

02:50:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) This is yours. 

02:50:30
JUSTIN Thank you. This is yours. 

02:50:35
SAM STEEN Alejandra's. 

02:50:40
JUSTIN This one's yours. 

02:50:45
SAM STEEN That's yours. Thank you. 

02:50:45
JUSTIN This is yours. This one's blank. 

02:50:50
SHERI BAUMAN That's mine. 

02:50:50
JUSTIN Oh. 

02:50:50
SHERI BAUMAN Remember 'cuz I did mine on the big paper ahead of time? 

02:50:55
JUSTIN Oh yeah. 

02:50:55
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ). 

02:50:59
SAM STEEN They're over here Sheri. 

02:51:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, there's some over here, too if you wanna pass out some others. We've got writing implements or however you would like to do it. 

02:51:10
SAM STEEN So just three events that were significant in your life. 

02:51:15
ALEJANDRA I don't... 

02:51:15
SAM STEEN You don't have to draw a picture. You can just write it. 

02:51:15
ALEJANDRA (inaudible ). 

02:51:18
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Say again? 

02:51:18
SHERI BAUMAN Something that was important or, um, that made a big difference in your life. 

02:51:20
SAM STEEN Like you gave an example but you don't have to use the same one. You saw a baby being born. That was pretty significant, it sounds like. 

02:51:30
TYLER Aw, what is this? 

02:51:30
ALEJANDRA It's a stamp. 

02:51:30
TYLER Oh. 

02:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN Sorry, it's a stamp. 

02:51:35
TYLER Oh. I was so confused. Thank you. 

02:51:45
[sil.] 

02:51:45
SHERI BAUMAN I'm trying to get the purple one. Thank you. 

02:51:50
SAM STEEN And you have about, when the big hand gets on the nine. 

02:51:55
ALEJANDRA So five minutes? (crosstalk) Four? 

02:52:00
SAM STEEN Like you're first graders. When, when the big hand gets on the nine, we'll let you quit. So quarter till. 

02:52:10
[sil.] 

02:52:10
JUSTIN What high school did you go to in DC? 

02:52:15
SAM STEEN I went to high school in Virginia. It's called Demby (ph) High School. You know where Mike Tomlin (ph) went to high school. 

02:52:20
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:52:20
SAM STEEN That's where I went to school. 

02:52:20
ALEJANDRA What do you want me to write? 

02:52:20
JUSTIN (crosstalk) My dad went to school (crosstalk inaudible ). 

02:52:25
SAM STEEN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

02:52:26
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Three things in your life that just seemed like they influenced you. Um, events or, um... 

02:52:30
SAM STEEN And then he went to college here. 

02:52:30
SHERI BAUMAN Situations. 

02:52:30
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Yeah, he went to U of A. 

02:52:30
SHERI BAUMAN Special events, (inaudible ). Something that happened. 

02:52:36
TAHLIA Like about anything? 

02:52:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, either one. 

02:52:45
[sil.] 

02:52:45
TYLER Here's the other one. 

02:52:45
SAM STEEN Okay. Okay, so at this point, you need to decide which one of those three you want to share with us and then figure out a way to describe the story or the event. Like tell us a little story about what happened. 

02:53:10
JUSTIN Um. 

02:53:10
SHERI BAUMAN So, can I just say, so sometimes you need a little background or sometimes you can just jump into it or, just whatever so we can kind of appreciate. 

02:53:20
JUSTIN Probably... 

02:53:25
SAM STEEN Hold on. You about to start? 

02:53:25
JUSTIN Oh, yeah. 

02:53:25
SAM STEEN Where are those note cards? Tyler, let me see them. Thanks. So before you, are you ready to start? 

02:53:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:53:35
SAM STEEN Okay. Before Justin goes, each of you will take, um, a card. Actually, you'll take five cards. Will you pass that 

02:53:50
[sil.] 

02:53:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

02:53:58
SHERI BAUMAN Like a little machine. 

02:54:00
SAM STEEN You like the colors I chose? Want me to stop? 

02:54:10
SHERI BAUMAN I noticed that the boys got pink. Let me see. 

02:54:15
JUSTIN We, we, we wear uniforms. One of the colors is pink. So. 

02:54:20
SAM STEEN At school? 

02:54:20
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:54:20
SAM STEEN So when Justin starts to share his story, what you're gonna do is on one side of the card, you write his name, right? So you know it was him. 

02:54:30
SHERI BAUMAN I think we should do that first. 

02:54:30
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

02:54:30
SHERI BAUMAN So it's ready. 

02:54:30
SAM STEEN You can write Justin since he's going first. And then on the other side, while he's talking... 

02:54:40
SHERI BAUMAN Or after. 

02:54:45
SAM STEEN Yeah, either way. 

02:54:45
SHERI BAUMAN It's tough to (inaudible ) as you're listening. 

02:54:50
SAM STEEN As you're listening. As you're listening, just think of a, um, think of a strength or an asset, you know, that you can gather or glean from what each person is talking about. So start with Justin. So as he shares his story, think of something that you find remarkable about how he dealt with his situation, like a strength or something that you felt like was, uh, an asset based on what he's sharing. Is there another way to say that Sheri? 

02:55:25
SHERI BAUMAN No, or, um, just some, um, positive trait. Some something... 

02:55:30
SAM STEEN That he, you know, demonstrated in the story he's telling. 

02:55:35
SHERI BAUMAN And you're not gonna share it right away so save it. 

02:55:40
SAM STEEN And it's anonymous too. So he won't know who wrote what. 

02:55:40
SHERI BAUMAN Okay? So when, we're gonna save these for the end, okay? 

02:55:45
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

02:55:45
JUSTIN All right. Um, one major thing in my life of 13 years... 

02:55:55
SAM STEEN Can you talk a little bit louder? I can't hear you. 

02:55:55
JUSTIN One major thing in my life of my, uh, 13 years would be my baby sister being born. Um, I remember my grandparents flew in that day and, um, they babysat me in the hospital room. I was only 6. We have a six, six year difference and, um, I remember playing, I, it's weird I remember this exactly. I remember playing with, um, Bionical (ph) puzzle thing person in the lobby and, um, my mom got me all these things to take care of and play with while she was giving birth to my sister. We were only there for like 30 minutes. It was, it happened really fast and I remember, there's a picture of me holding my sister and stuff. I just remember, oh yeah. And then she was crying a lot and we couldn't get her to stop crying and, um, I went over to her and I just like touched her arm like that. She stopped crying. She just looked at me for, like, a really long time and, yeah. That was probably the most memorable days of my life. 

02:57:00
SHERI BAUMAN That's really interesting 'cuz so often, um, you know, the birth of a sibling is, is important but it may be because oh I thought I was gonna get a puppy kind of important then for you and you were part of it and it mattered to you. 

02:57:20
JUSTIN Yeah. 

02:57:20
SHERI BAUMAN And you were 6, so you were big enough to understand, huh? 

02:57:25
JUSTIN Yeah. My sister, I'm really close with my sister but, as she sees it, she thinks I'm mean to her and, since I baby sit her and to me, she wants to do things that she's not supposed to be doing because her mom's not there and she gets mad at me 'cuz I don't let her do it. I still take care of her and stuff. 

02:57:40
SHERI BAUMAN And you were there when she entered the world, huh? 

02:57:45
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. 

02:57:45
SAM STEEN Once you're finished jotting those down, I'll take 'em. That way I can hold onto them. 

02:57:50
ALEJANDRA What are we supposed to write on the back? 

02:57:55
SHERI BAUMAN Some quality or characteristic or something that showed that tells us something about Justin's good quality, yeah. 

02:58:05
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Experience? 

02:58:05
SHERI BAUMAN So not just saying he was there but what did that, you know... 

02:58:10
ALEJANDRA Show? 

02:58:10
SHERI BAUMAN Mm-hmm. 

02:58:10
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

02:58:15
SHERI BAUMAN Not just being there, but the story. 

02:58:20
[sil.] 

02:58:20
SAM STEEN You can pass them down right here. 

02:58:35
[sil.] 

02:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN There's a couple more coming. 

02:58:50
[sil.] 

02:58:50

02:59:10
SHERI BAUMAN Wow. 

02:59:10
SAM STEEN Did everybody do that? So who would like to go next? 

02:59:15
SHERI BAUMAN Justin, how about you pick who goes next? 

02:59:25
JUSTIN Okay. Tahlia. 

02:59:25
TAHLIA Okay. 

02:59:30
SAM STEEN That's how you spell her name. 

02:59:30
TAHLIA I don't have to write my... 

02:59:35
SHERI BAUMAN No, you don't do it for yourself. 

02:59:35
TAHLIA Okay. Okay, when I moved to Arizona from Oregon. 

02:59:40
SHERI BAUMAN Tell us about that. What was that like? 

02:59:45
TAHLIA It was horrible 

02:59:45
SHERI BAUMAN And you, how old were you? 

02:59:50
TAHLIA I was in 4th grade and I lived in the, in a culdesac, you know? 

03:00:00
SHERI BAUMAN In Oregon or here? 

03:00:00
TAHLIA In, in Oregon. 

03:00:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

03:00:00
TAHLIA And, like, there was a lot of kids that lived on the street and we would always, like, go outside and play with them, you know? And there was a girl that lived down the street and she was my best friend at the time and so it was, it was really sad when, that I had to leave because my mom wanted to go to college here. 

03:00:25
SHERI BAUMAN So what do you remember about actually leaving? Did you drive? Did you go to the airport? 

03:00:30
TAHLIA We drove. 

03:00:30
SHERI BAUMAN So you had a car full of stuff? 

03:00:35
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:00:35
SAM STEEN And how long did it take you to, have, well, have you gotten over that move from Oregon to this place yet? 

03:00:50
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:00:50
SAM STEEN Yeah? How long did it take you then? 

03:00:50
TAHLIA To drive over there? 

03:00:50
SAM STEEN To get over, to feel comfortable in Arizona? 

03:00:55
TAHLIA Oh, like a whole year. 

03:00:55
SAM STEEN It took you a year? 

03:00:55
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:01:00
SAM STEEN And what helped? 

03:01:00
TAHLIA Um, when I went to middle school. There, it was like better people there than in 5th grade. I didn't like 5th grade. 

03:01:10
TYLER God I hated 5th grade. 

03:01:10
SHERI BAUMAN Well it sounds like in 4th grade you had, you know, these friends you knew and everything and then in 5th grade... 

03:01:20
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Yeah. And it was, it was like a really small town, so everyone knew everyone. 

03:01:20
SHERI BAUMAN And then you come to Tuscon. What town did you used to live in? I'm just curious. 

03:01:30
TAHLIA Um, Sutherland. It's next to (inaudible ). 

03:01:37
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, okay. 

03:01:37
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:01:37
SHERI BAUMAN I do know that. 

03:01:37
SAM STEEN Any other questions for Tahlia to see if you can... Okay. If you're done with that one, you can pass it around. 

03:01:50
[sil.] 

03:01:50
JUSTIN You still talk to your best friend? No? 

03:02:10
SAM STEEN What was your question? 

03:02:10
JUSTIN Does she still talk to her best friend? Are you friends with her on Facebook? 

03:02:15
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:02:15
SHERI BAUMAN Has anybody else ever moved a long way like that? You did? Where'd you move from? 

03:02:25
BRIANNA From Pennsylvania. 

03:02:25
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

03:02:25
TYLER Wow. 

03:02:25
SHERI BAUMAN You too? 

03:02:25
TYLER I moved here from D.C. 

03:02:30
SHERI BAUMAN So were you old enough to have left friends and all those things? 

03:02:35
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) You drove? 

03:02:35
TYLER (crosstalk) We drove. 

03:02:35
TYLER (crosstalk) You drove? That's like across the country. 

03:02:35
SAM STEEN You drove. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:02:38
TYLER That's horrible. I've driven to Oregon. That's like three days. 

03:02:50
JUSTIN (inaudible ). 

03:02:51
TYLER Right? Those were (inaudible ). 

03:02:53
SAM STEEN I'll take those Alejandra. 

03:02:53
TYLER I hate the humidity in Florida though. 

03:02:53
SHERI BAUMAN Sam, shall we ask Tahlia to pick the next person. 

03:03:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Sure. 

03:03:00
TAHLIA Brianna. 

03:03:00
BRIANNA Well, I don't feel like crying right now so I'm just gonna say the time I started playing sports. The first sport I ever played was soccer and then I went to baseball and then started softball when I was 8 and now I play, still play softball and baseball but I'm also into motocross and BMX because it keeps me out of trouble and it makes me, like, wanna keep doing good in school and stuff so I an still go out and hang out with friends and not be in trouble for the grades or talking back to the teacher. 

03:03:40
SHERI BAUMAN So how, do you remember your very first soccer game? 

03:03:45
BRIANNA I made a goal from the other side of the, the other side of the field because the other team wasn't paying attention. 

03:03:55
SHERI BAUMAN And so I, I've never been in sports. How old is someone who starts, like how old were you when you played that first game? 

03:04:00
BRIANNA Seven. 

03:04:00
SHERI BAUMAN So you're in school, just starting school. And was it a, just a girl's team or mixed or? 

03:04:10
BRIANNA It was for SWS so pretty much everyone. 

03:04:20
[sil.] 

03:04:20
SAM STEEN How many sports did you name? 

03:04:20
BRIANNA Five. 

03:04:20
JUSTIN What were they again? 

03:04:35
BRIANNA Softball, baseball, soccer, motocross, and BMX. 

03:04:40
SAM STEEN Motocross? Is that a motorcycle? And BMX is just a bike? I got those mixed up. 

03:04:50
[sil.] 

03:04:50
SHERI BAUMAN Bri, when you said you didn't wanna, feel like crying. So one of the events was a sad one? 

03:05:00
BRIANNA Well, it was, it wasn't sad at the time but now that another event had happened, it would have been sad. So. 

03:05:10
SHERI BAUMAN And just, without doing it, what were, what was, do you imagine would be like if you did start to cry in here? 

03:05:20
BRIANNA Well, it wouldn't bother because it's human nature for someone to cry. I just don't feel like crying. 

03:05:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Get your makeup all over your face and all of those things. 

03:05:30
BRIANNA I don't care. 

03:05:30
SAM STEEN But it's human nature. Do you feel safe enough that if you cried, that you would be okay? 

03:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN That you'd be treated well and? Okay. So. 

03:05:40
TYLER Here you go. 

03:05:40
SAM STEEN Who should go next Brianna? 

03:05:45
BRIANNA Tyler. 

03:05:50
TYLER Okay. So mine, I'd have to say that mine would have to be when my brother was born, uh, 'cuz he's, like, like my best friend. We, we get along. I'm glad we get along so well. You know? But since he's so much younger than me, we always, we don't always, you know, get along perfectly 'cuz, you know, he's so much younger and we're, it's kinda, we're both opposites yet we're like both the same. Like, I don't know. We kinda, we have different personalities but like the same interests. And, uh, I don't know. I think I have, I like, if he ever like leaves the house and I'm by myself, I always feel so lonely 'cuz I have no one to, like, hang out with and so I just feel like everything would be so much more boring if I didn't have him with me. So, yeah, he's really important to me. 

03:06:50
SHERI BAUMAN How interesting that not only was that the birth of this younger sibling important but they were the same distance in age from the two of you guys. 

03:07:00
JUSTIN That's how I feel too. My sister's always bugging me but there's, there's just an emptiness when you're by yourself, huh? 

03:07:05
TYLER Yeah, yeah. Feels weird not having him running around everywhere and, like, yelling. 

03:07:10
SAM STEEN So they bother you on one hand but when they're gone, you miss 'em. 

03:07:15
TYLER I know. Yeah. 

03:07:15
SHERI BAUMAN So do you remember actually the day he was born? 

03:07:20
TYLER Yeah, actually. I, uh, it was kind of funny. He was born and like, uh, I was holding him and I had gum in my mouth and, like, I looked down at him and I went aww and the gum fell out of my mouth onto his face. Yeah, it was, it was funny. That's like... 

03:07:35
SAM STEEN Have you, have you told him that story? 

03:07:40
TYLER Yeah. That's like my one memory of, from the day he was born, so. 

03:07:40
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ) dropping you gum on him? 

03:07:45
TYLER (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah, it was funny. 

03:07:45
BRIANNA Are you sure you didn't do it on purpose? 

03:07:45
TYLER No, I, maybe I did. I don't know. 

03:07:50
SHERI BAUMAN I have to tell you that I didn't have any brothers or sisters so I love these stories. 

03:08:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Tyler's (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:08:01
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:08:03
SAM STEEN It's okay. (inaudible ). 

03:08:07
ALEJANDRA Yeah, so they can tell the differnce. 

03:08:10
[sil.] 

03:08:10
SAM STEEN So we have a couple more. So who should go next, Tyler? 

03:08:20
TYLER I'm gonna pick the other Tyler. 

03:08:25
[sil.] 

03:08:25
JUSTIN Whose handwriting is this? 

03:08:25
SAM STEEN Doesn't matter. 

03:08:25
SHERI BAUMAN What, is it, what prompted the question? 

03:08:45
JUSTIN It was nice. 

03:08:45
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

03:08:50
[sil.] 

03:08:50
UNKNOWN It keeps you jumping. 

03:08:50
SAM STEEN Am I good to go? 

03:09:00
JUSTIN I guess. 

03:09:00
SHERI BAUMAN Is it (inaudible )? 

03:09:05
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

03:09:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, great. 

03:09:05
TYLER Am I good to go? 

03:09:10
SAM STEEN Yeah, you're good. Yeah. 

03:09:10
TYLER I just put Tyler number two. 

03:09:10
ALEJANDRA Draw a baseball. 

03:09:15
SHERI BAUMAN That's a good idea. 

03:09:15
ALEJANDRA That's what I did. And I drew a police agent for him. 

03:09:20
SHERI BAUMAN That pretty good? 

03:09:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:09:30
[sil.] 

03:09:30
TYLER Oh, okay. 

03:09:30
SHERI BAUMAN Good, I'm glad you waited. Thanks. 

03:09:35
TYLER I remember when I first started playing baseball. Um, I lived in Washington D.C. I can remember the first day. It was opening ceremonies. Um, my size, 'cuz I was the last one to join the team, I had my, all my clothes were two sizes bigger than what I had to wear and so it looked like I was wearing a dress and then in that game, I was playing tee ball. I remember I broke the tee the first day. I cracked the tee in half 'cuz I was so small and then I can't remember when I actually got a hit. My dad cheered for me and he ran onto the field to pick me up in the middle of our game, which I felt really embarrassed about that but I can still remember playing the first day. I was about, yeah, 3 years old. 

03:10:30
SHERI BAUMAN Tell us more about your dad picking you up. I didn't quite... 

03:10:30
TYLER He was just excited 'cuz it was my first hit as a little kid and he has always wanted me to play baseball. He's told me that he always wanted a son to play baseball 'cuz my brother was of a football type of kid and so he was just really excited when I got my hit. 

03:10:50
SHERI BAUMAN So he ran out right in the middle of the game? 

03:10:50
TYLER Yeah. Right in the middle of the game. 

03:10:55
JUSTIN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:10:58
ALEJANDRA Can I ask something? 

03:10:58
SHERI BAUMAN Sure. 

03:10:58
SAM STEEN Of course. 

03:10:58
TYLER No. 

03:10:58
ALEJANDRA Um, when you, like, played baseball for the first time, bless you, was it, did you think, are you, like, playing baseball to make your dad proud or you did see that you enjoy baseball? 

03:11:10
TYLER No, I enjoy baseball. I wouldn't care if all my family hated baseball. I'd still be playing it. 

03:11:15
SHERI BAUMAN Ale, you've asked that sort of question a couple of times, you know, whether people are doing things for someone else or themselves. I'm wondering where that question comes from. 

03:11:30
ALEJANDRA What do you mean? 

03:11:30
SHERI BAUMAN Like, it sounds like that's something that's important to you, whether, or that you notice, you know, whether someone... 

03:11:40
ALEJANDRA Oh, I just notice that lots of kids, like, do something whether, like, let's say if he didn't like baseball. Like he was playing and he didn't like it. Like some, they just, some kids do things to make their parents proud although, like, they sacrifice stuff. That's why I asked but I had a feeling he did like baseball. 

03:12:05
[sil.] 

03:12:05
TYLER Do you like watching baseball? 

03:12:05
TYLER Mm-hmm. 

03:12:05
JUSTIN I can't watch baseball. I can go to the game, but I can't watch baseball on TV though. 

03:12:20
TYLER (crosstalk) I can't. Yeah, neither can I. 

03:12:20
TYLER Neither can I. I don't watch it on TV at all. 

03:12:25
JUSTIN Yeah, that's hard. It's too slow. 

03:12:25
TYLER Exactly. That's how I feel. I can go to the games 'cuz you don't have to like watch it. You can like do other stuff too. 

03:12:30
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

03:12:30
TYLER I just can't watch it. It just, like, so... 

03:12:35
SAM STEEN You should only have one more. 

03:12:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, but I don't have any more. 

03:12:35
SAM STEEN Oh, here. Give that to, um, Sheri. Was that, do I have all of Tyler's? 

03:12:45
ALEJANDRA We're finished. 

03:12:45
SAM STEEN There should be one more. 

03:12:45
ALEJANDRA What would that one be? 

03:12:50
SAM STEEN Oh, I wonder who that person is. 

03:12:50
ALEJANDRA Why did you put that right there? 

03:12:55
SHERI BAUMAN 'Cuz it's wrong. There. Right? 

03:13:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah, with a J. 

03:13:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Well, I meant well. I'm sorry. 

03:13:05
ALEJANDRA You're fine. I just thought, never mind. 

03:13:10
SAM STEEN Are you ready for Alejandra? 

03:13:15
[sil.] 

03:13:15
SAM STEEN And if you can write it different for Alejandra, that'd be helpful, right? 

03:13:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:13:20
JUSTIN I'll write it in cursive. 

03:13:25
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

03:13:25
TYLER I can't even write cursive. It's too hard. Takes too long. 

03:13:30
JUSTIN Cursive is my favorite. 

03:13:30
SAM STEEN Did you go yet? 

03:13:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah I did. 

03:13:30
SAM STEEN I didn't hear it. 

03:13:35
SHERI BAUMAN Good try. 

03:13:35
ALEJANDRA I guess, I don't know what to say. 

03:13:45
SAM STEEN Oh, you don't wanna share that one? 

03:13:45
ALEJANDRA I don't know which one to share. 

03:13:50
TYLER Eenie, meenie, miney moe. 

03:13:55
BRIANNA Catch a tiger by it's toe. 

03:13:55
ALEJANDRA I guess meeting my boyfriend. 

03:13:55
SAM STEEN Okay. That's the most significant event in your life? 

03:14:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:14:00
SAM STEEN Or it's one of three. 

03:14:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:14:05
SAM STEEN Meeting your boyfriend. Tell us more about that. 

03:14:05
ALEJANDRA Um, before him, I just didn't see, like, I viewed life differently in a bad way, you know? Negatively. And when I met him, I just saw the positive things in life. 

03:14:20
SHERI BAUMAN So what was it about him that helped you change the way you see things? 

03:14:30
ALEJANDRA Just the way, like, he treats me and in the way, sorry, um, the way he sees things. Like, I saw his different opinion and, like... 

03:14:45
SHERI BAUMAN So he didn't see the world the way you did? 

03:14:50
ALEJANDRA Nope. He saw it in a better, positive way. 

03:14:50
SHERI BAUMAN So what's interesting to me is yet you were attracted to him. You know, sometimes we look for someone who's just like ourselves. So you saw someone different and (inaudible ). 

03:15:09
JUSTIN Opposites attract. 

03:15:09
UNKNOWN I was just about to say that. 

03:15:10
SAM STEEN That opposites attract? 

03:15:10
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:15:10
SAM STEEN What I'm thinking is what, what caused you to go to him, to seek him? You know, if it's opposites attract, what about him? 

03:15:20
ALEJANDRA Well, everyone asks us how we met, like he went to my school but, like, I never knew him. Like, um, we met in detention and I just, like, I think he got my number and we just started talking and we went to the movies and I started hanging, hanging out with him more and I just got to know him, you know? Like he was my best friend. He is, you know? And then we started going out. 

03:15:55
SAM STEEN So you became friends with him first before you started dating? 

03:15:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:15:55
SAM STEEN And since you were in detention, there was no pressure about it. 

03:16:00
ALEJANDRA No. 

03:16:00
SAM STEEN It wasn't like you were at a party or something. 

03:16:00
ALEJANDRA Well, yeah. It's the weird thing, one. He's really my second boyfriend and, like, at the time, I was going out with my first boyfriend but I wasn't, like, he wasn't like, he was the one that everyone wanted so he wouldn't really pay attention to me, you know? So one day on my friend's birthday, we went to my boyfriend's house 'cuz we were gonna play video games and, um... 

03:16:35
SAM STEEN Are y'all about to follow the story? 

03:16:35
TYLER Yeah. 

03:16:40
ALEJANDRA I don't know if this is appropriate. Like... 

03:16:40
SAM STEEN I would say take a risk and just say it. 

03:16:40
ALEJANDRA So, they started, like, making out, my boyfriend and a friend of mine. 

03:16:45
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Your first girlfriend. 

03:16:45
ALEJANDRA No, my boyfriend. 

03:16:45
SAM STEEN Your first boyfriend or the current one? 

03:16:50
ALEJANDRA The current one. 

03:16:50
SAM STEEN Okay. 

03:16:50
ALEJANDRA And, like, I guess I just got jealous. That's how I knew that I liked him. So then I told him and I broke up with my boyfriend for him and, yeah. 

03:17:00
SAM STEEN So it also sounds like she was dating two people at the same time, right? Yes? No? Or am I just reading too deeply into it? 

03:17:10
BRIANNA She said that her friend and the dude started making out. So then she got jealous and then she realized that she liked him. So she wasn't... 

03:17:15
SAM STEEN Oh. 

03:17:15
ALEJANDRA 'Cuz like we... 

03:17:20
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) I got it. They were friends. 

03:17:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah but we like, we had our moments while I was dating. Like, he would just like be sweet you know, but I wasn't being mean to my boyfriend so I was like, no. I have a boyfriend. 

03:17:30
SAM STEEN Right. 

03:17:30
ALEJANDRA And I remember that day 'cuz we were at school to watch a play and we were in the cafeteria and, um, we started dancing, like Cinderella and his, her Prince Charming. And so, yeah. 

03:17:50
SAM STEEN You smile a lot when you talk about him. 

03:17:55
ALEJANDRA Yep. 

03:17:55
SAM STEEN Any other questions for, uh, Alejandra? 

03:18:00
TYLER Here's my card. 

03:18:05
ALEJANDRA The boys are probably gonna get annoyed 'cuz I'm talking about him. 

03:18:10
SHERI BAUMAN Can you find out by asking them if they're annoyed, you think? 

03:18:20
ALEJANDRA Justin, are you annoyed? 

03:18:20
JUSTIN I don't really care. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:18:24
ALEJANDRA Tylers? 

03:18:24
TYLER I, I'm not annoyed. 

03:18:25
TYLER I agree. 

03:18:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

03:18:30
SAM STEEN Was it helpful to hear her perspective about relationships?- 

03:18:30
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:18:30
SAM STEEN Yes. You think? 

03:18:35
ALEJANDRA Well, you've been with your girlfriend how long? 

03:18:35
JUSTIN It's not that long. Probably like three weeks now. 

03:18:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. I've been with mine since... 

03:18:40
SHERI BAUMAN No, no, no, no. Give 'em to Sam. 

03:18:45
SAM STEEN Yeah. Let me see 'em. 

03:18:45
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:18:47
SAM STEEN Tyler, did you hear Justin. 

03:18:47
TYLER What? 

03:18:47
SAM STEEN He said he'd been with his girlfriend only three weeks. 

03:18:50
TYLER Oh. 

03:18:50
ALEJANDRA He is with his girlfriend barely, like, he barely... 

03:18:55
SAM STEEN Just recently. 

03:18:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:18:55
SHERI BAUMAN So about that, I'm just, this is nosy but are all of you, like, allowed to date or have boyfriends? 

03:19:00
BRIANNA No. 

03:19:00
UNKNOWN I am. 

03:19:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

03:19:00
BRIANNA I do anyway. 

03:19:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. Well I, that's why I asked it the way I did. I assumed. 

03:19:05
ALEJANDRA Well, my dad didn't want me going out but, like I told him 'cuz if I don't tell 'em, I'm still gonna do it behind their back so I just preferred him and my mom to know. 

03:19:15
JUSTIN I told my parents. They got a little upset at the beginning and my mom especially, like seeing a girl up and stuff. She, um, got a little upset but my dad was supportive and he told my mom I gotta, like, grow up and stuff and, so. 

03:19:35
SHERI BAUMAN So you're at a time where that's gonna happen more and more. 

03:19:40
JUSTIN And then my girlfriend, when she met her, my mom was a lot happier. She really likes her. 

03:19:45
ALEJANDRA Are you the oldest or the littlest? 

03:19:45
JUSTIN Yeah, I'm the oldest. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:19:49
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk inaudible ). Well, you're her first one right? She doesn't want her baby to leave? 

03:19:50
JUSTIN Is that what you think? 

03:19:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:19:55
JUSTIN I think the same thing too. 

03:19:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:19:55
BRIANNA My parents they frown upon it. They don't want me to but they don't care if I do as long as the, the guy is... 

03:20:05
ALEJANDRA Respectful? 

03:20:05
BRIANNA Yeah. 

03:20:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:20:05
SHERI BAUMAN So they, do you typically introduce people you're going out with to your family? 

03:20:10
BRIANNA Well, it depends on how long it's been. Not like the first day. That's weird. 

03:20:15
ALEJANDRA It is. Scare him away. 

03:20:20
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Well she comes to my football practices 'cuz her younger brother, um, practices in the younger team, the cadet team so, um, she comes to my practices and that was the first time I introduced her to my parents. 

03:20:30
SAM STEEN So it sounds like for some of you, relationships, boyfriends, girlfriends, is pretty important. The other few, maybe not as important. Not good or bad, just not as important. Do you wanna weigh in on what you hear at this point? 

03:20:45
TAHLIA What? 

03:20:45
SAM STEEN Do you have any reaction to what you're hearing about their relationships? 

03:20:50
TAHLIA No. 

03:20:50
JUSTIN I know people that are probably gonna see this. They're probably be like well, they're too young and stuff. 

03:21:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. That's what I was gonna say but, like, I think they just want us to focus on school and I mean, my one, first priority is school and then... 

03:21:05
JUSTIN (crosstalk) See, it's like football. It should make you want to do better in school so that you can hang out with... 

03:21:15
ALEJANDRA Your... 

03:21:15
JUSTIN Your girlfriend. 

03:21:15
SAM STEEN So for you, it's a form of motivation? 

03:21:20
SHERI BAUMAN So you said adults. Did you have any particular adults you were thinking of that adults tend to think this or that? 

03:21:25
ALEJANDRA My sisters. 

03:21:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So people in your family? 

03:21:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Or like teachers. Well, not really teachers 'cuz they're like aww, we're all cute. You know? 

03:21:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:21:35
ALEJANDRA But... 

03:21:35
JUSTIN Some of my, some of my cousins, they always tease me. 

03:21:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:21:40
SAM STEEN What I'm thinking is that, these cards, I'm gonna give to you all but I won't give them to you today. I'm giving them to you next time so then that way, you'll have time to actually read them and then to respond to what you read in there because we're running out of time. Is that okay? But, before we finish, just reflect on the thought process, what you thought about in order to write down your event. What were you thinking when you were writing down, choosing to write down your thing? 

03:22:10
BRIANNA What type of person they are. 

03:22:10
SAM STEEN What, oh, oh, about the people you're writing about? So when you wrote about someone else, you were thinking what type of person overall they were? Is that right? 

03:22:20
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

03:22:20
SHERI BAUMAN So that in the time you spent together, you have an impression of the kind of people are in the group with you. 

03:22:25
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

03:22:25
SHERI BAUMAN Cool. 

03:22:25
SAM STEEN And then what about in terms of, um, anybody else wanna respond to that? When you were choosing how to respond, writing about someone else? What was coming to your mind? 

03:22:35
TAHLIA I wrote what I thought about them, by like, yeah. 

03:22:40
SAM STEEN Even beyond their story it sounds like. And then what was it like to tell your story? You seem like Alejandra struggled a little bit to pick and choose one. You talked about not wanting to cry or be emotional about it. What, what, how, what was it like to pick and choose your... 

03:23:00
ALEJANDRA I think it was like hard 'cuz, like, we're trusting people to hear these stories. So... 

03:23:05
SAM STEEN People making judgments about you. 

03:23:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:23:10
SAM STEEN You're shaking your head. 

03:23:10
TYLER Yeah. I, I can agree with that 'cuz, you know, 'cuz you don't, like I mean, we all know it each other but not all that well, so. 

03:23:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:23:20
TYLER I could, yeah. 

03:23:20
ALEJANDRA I think you're trusting someone with something big. 

03:23:25
TYLER Yeah. 

03:23:25
SHERI BAUMAN And how did you decide how trustworthy this group is at this point? 

03:23:30
ALEJANDRA It's pretty high. 

03:23:35
TYLER Yeah. Everyone's, like I said, everyone's nice and, like, I don't know. I, I feel like I can talk, really, and, like nobody's gonna like make fun of me or anything. So, yeah. 

03:23:45
SAM STEEN Are you curious to find out what these cards say? 

03:23:50
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. 

03:23:50
TYLER Yeah. 

03:23:50
SAM STEEN A little bit? Some of you yes? Well, we'll do that next time. We'll start with that and then we'll go from there. Is that good? 

03:23:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:23:55
SAM STEEN All right. So see you next week. 

03:24:00
End of Session 4 

03:24:05
[sil.] 

03:24:05
Session 4 Processing 

03:24:15
[music] 

03:24:15
SAM STEEN So what do you think about that session? 

03:24:20
SHERI BAUMAN I thought it was interesting that they're aware of the process. You know, she chose to choose, she chose to talk about something that wasn't gonna be painful. 

03:24:25
SAM STEEN Who is she? 

03:24:25
SHERI BAUMAN Bri and that... 

03:24:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Oh. 

03:24:30
SHERI BAUMAN And that Alejandra felt as though she took a risk. Um, I thought the, that it was touching, the two boys talking about their arrival of their siblings. 

03:24:45
SAM STEEN Oh yeah, for sure. Big brothers. I thought you did a good job of focusing on the process more than the content of the activity. For me, the activity seemed to get in the way. For me personally. Not in the way necessarily of them but in the way of my thinking 'cuz here I am trying to hear their stories and write down their stories and manage five cards and manage, do they even understand the activity, etc., etc., versus saying think of a significant event in your life. Describe that event and/or respond or maybe jot down something that you found meaningful in that story. 

03:25:20
SHERI BAUMAN So you say there were maybe too many (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:25:22
SAM STEEN Too many steps. Yeah, for sure. 

03:25:22
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

03:25:22
SAM STEEN But, but I appreciated the fact that I could sit back and kind of allow, like, yeah, I was facilitating the activity but you were facilitating the process. So then I began to relax a little bit more and say that works out well. You know? I didn't feel like I had to both, if that makes any sense. 

03:25:35
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. See, to me, the, the three gave them that opt out. You know, this may be the most significant but, and I was glad to hear at the end, for example, the trust came up. You know, how much can I trust this group to, to treat my significant event appropriately. So... 

03:25:55
SAM STEEN What I also reflect on is how, um, there's some, not commentary, but, but you know where the students or the kids will say well, I don't know if this is appropriate, you know, so they wanna kinda get a sense of can I say this or not and so we're giving, encouraging them to say it and did you find any of that inappropriate? 

03:26:15
SHERI BAUMAN No. 

03:26:15
SAM STEEN Not even remotely, you know? 

03:26:15
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Yeah. I thought... 

03:26:20
SAM STEEN Yeah. So maybe we can push 'em a little bit more. You know? What do you think in terms of the content? You know, about, because overall, we're, we're trying to infuse race, ethnicity, and culture, you know? We had that conversation early on and some of the structured activities get to that. That one didn't, not even once did it come up. 

03:26:40
SHERI BAUMAN No. 

03:26:40
SAM STEEN I think the last session, not even once did it come up. Uh, someone reflected on Justin being strong or something like that, as an African American or, but what is your thought about that? I'm just curious. 

03:26:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I think it's important to broach it when it fits and to bring it up, to be mindful of when that emerges as a significant piece but I think we've, in my opinion, not rammed it down their throats where it wasn't there. So we might wanna think about that in terms, well, we will in, in one of those other activities. Um. 

03:27:20
SAM STEEN I see your point. So you're saying when it's, when it fits, then we capitalize on that or we explore that but it should emerge from them versus us throwing it down their throats. 

03:27:35
SHERI BAUMAN Right. And I think the first couple of sessions, it was clearly, um, raised. I mean, people mentioned being conscious of, of discrimination that they'd experienced and so forth, so I don't think they'd be reluctant to bring it up. 

03:27:55
SAM STEEN No, I don't think so. I think they all chimed in on it. When you think about individual members, before we move to what to do next session, when you think about individual members, anybody you're concerned about or you wanna hear from more often or, or anything like that? 

03:28:10
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you know, I noticed the kids are inviting the, the, the more quiet of the two Tylers and that, when he does participate, he's engaged. So I'm more concerned when someone seems not only quiet but unengaged with the others. 

03:28:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Right. 

03:28:30
SHERI BAUMAN And I don't see that happening. What about you? 

03:28:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) So he definitely engaged. Yeah, he reminds me of Gage (ph) from the last video who would look like he's not paying attention and you ask him and then he'd chime right in. So Tyler's in that, in that respect, he, he does. When we start talking about relationships, it seems like a few of them do, not disengage, but kinda like don't wanna associate with me participating. The two Tylers in particular. 

03:28:50
SHERI BAUMAN And you know what's funny about that. I mean, we're talking about developmental ages and stages and we see the difference betweet.n boys and girls. Um, we see that it's not a uniform process where every kid reaches the same stage either physical or socially, emotionally. 

03:29:10
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Right, right. 

03:29:10
SHERI BAUMAN I mean, just look at the group. Um, so I think that's what makes 8th grade in particular such an interesting time. We have some kids who look like young adults and who have experiences maybe, um, that the others are barely, you know, entering in terms of the stage. 

03:29:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Right, right. 

03:29:30
SHERI BAUMAN So and it's, but I did like is that nobody kind of put down Tylers for not being... 

03:29:40
SAM STEEN That's true. Teasing them or talking to 'em. 

03:29:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. Um. 

03:29:40
SAM STEEN So as we move forward, you know, we had, um, our activity would be a little bit more open ended. Do you recall that? 

03:29:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right. But I think processing, giving them their comments and, do we want them to not read them aloud, just read them to themselves and reflect on what was meaningful to them? 

03:30:00
SAM STEEN It's gonna be a tough call because, again, we could spend the whole session talking about that one. 

03:30:05
SHERI BAUMAN But I think it's meaningful enough that we definitely, I, I think we should not have them read them aloud unless they, there's something that they're really, that's important to them, that they want to let the rest of the group know but that mainly what we want them to do is reflect and talk about what they got from the cards and how they feel about that and then open it up if we have time. 

03:30:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Okay, so let's start with that. They'll reflect on their experiences after reading those cards. Correct? And any reaction to that. And then we'll move to so, moving forward. 

03:30:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

03:30:40
SAM STEEN You know, some of the things we wanted to bring up was transitioning to high school, relationships, family, maybe culture or diversity. What would y'all like to talk about today? Is that right? 

03:30:50
SHERI BAUMAN That's what I'm thinking. 

03:30:50
SAM STEEN So you could open that prompt and pretty much we'll spend that session doing that and then we'll decide how to move forward after that. 

03:30:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, what do we wanna do for our opener, our quickie opener? 

03:31:00
SAM STEEN I think that's it. Let's just start with that. 

03:31:00
SHERI BAUMAN Which? 

03:31:00
SAM STEEN Reflecting on their last activity because it's, it's a, it's more, it's more, then you're adding three things. 

03:31:10
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

03:31:10
SAM STEEN You understand what I mean? 

03:31:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

03:31:10
SAM STEEN Let's just reflect on that. 

03:31:10
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

03:31:10
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Is that good? 

03:31:10
SHERI BAUMAN So we'll give them the cards and, okay. 

03:31:15
SAM STEEN Tell them to think about, take the time to read them and then what are their reactions to that. 

03:31:20
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

03:31:20
SAM STEEN All right. Good job. 

03:31:25
SHERI BAUMAN You too. 

03:31:25
End of Session 4 Processing

[sil.] 

03:31:30
Session 5 

03:31:35
[music] 

03:31:35
SAM STEEN Well welcome back everybody. 

03:31:35
BRIANNA Hi. 

03:31:35
TYLER Welcome back. 

03:31:45
SAM STEEN You awake? You said welcome back? 

03:31:45
TYLER Welcome back. 

03:31:50
SAM STEEN Do you recall what we did towards the end of last session? 

03:31:50
BRIANNA We wrote on cards. 

03:31:55
SAM STEEN You wrote on cards. 

03:31:55
ALEJANDRA About the story we shared. Yeah. 

03:31:55
SAM STEEN People were sharing stories and... 

03:32:00
TYLER Strengths. 

03:32:00
SAM STEEN Strengths of other people that you saw. 

03:32:00
BRIANNA Yep. 

03:32:00
SAM STEEN So at this point, I, I mentioned, um, I'm gonna pass them out. Last time we didn't have enough time to go through. Are you curious to find out what they said? What they say about you? 

03:32:10
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

03:32:10
SAM STEEN So what Sheri and I were talking about it that we'll pass them out and you read them to yourself and then you can, um, just take a moment to read through them and then we can, if you have something you wanna share, not necessarily what someone wrote but maybe how you felt about what you're reading, you can feel free to do that. And we'll ask you along the way. 

03:32:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. I might ask you to think about, as you're reading them, is, is there kind of a theme or a lot of people seeing these same qualities in you, um, and what would that be and then how it feels to hear that. 

03:32:45
SAM STEEN And so we'll all try to read them at the same time so I'll pass them out now. Smith, correct? 

03:32:50
TYLER Yep. 

03:32:50
SHERI BAUMAN And if you're, you're having trouble reading any, let us... 

03:32:55
JUSTIN Thank you. 

03:32:55
SAM STEEN And if I made a mistake, please, sorry about that. 

03:33:00
JUSTIN We allowed to look at them? 

03:33:00
SAM STEEN Not yet. 

03:33:00
SHERI BAUMAN Mm-hmm. Oh. 

03:33:00
SAM STEEN We'll read 'em at the same time. 

03:33:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oopsie. 

03:33:00
SAM STEEN That was it's not fair. 

03:33:05
TYLER What? Oh, we're not reading yet? 

03:33:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. I would, I know I would have been... 

03:33:10
TYLER I only read the first sentence, so it's okay. 

03:33:10
SAM STEEN Stiltner. Perfect. Okay. So now go ahead and take a look. 

03:33:20
TAHLIA Oh now we can read? 

03:33:25
SAM STEEN Yes, please. 

03:33:25
TAHLIA Okay. 

03:33:30
[sil.] 

03:33:30
SAM STEEN So did y'all have a chance? What are you feeling right now at this moment? 

03:34:40
JUSTIN Happy. 

03:34:40
TYLER Yeah, I feel glad that people said nice things. 

03:34:45
ALEJANDRA Oh my god. 

03:34:45
SAM STEEN Oh, you were, you were worried that they might not have been nice? Is that what you're saying? 

03:34:55
TYLER Well, I, not really worried but, like, I don't know. I, I don't know. I'm just glad that people would, said nice things. 

03:35:00
SAM STEEN Yeah? 

03:35:00
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

03:35:00
SAM STEEN So you're happy. You're glad people said nice things and you reacted to it. That's why I'm asking. 

03:35:05
ALEJANDRA I'm glad someone, like, they stayed, they were true. They didn't lie, you know? They were straight up about something, you know? 

03:35:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) They were honest. You appreciate the straight upness? 

03:35:15
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

03:35:20
SAM STEEN Like Justin said, they were keeping it real. 

03:35:20
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

03:35:20
SAM STEEN They were keeping it real. What do you think Bri? What are you feeling when you read them? 

03:35:30
BRIANNA That they want me to keep playing sports. 

03:35:30
SAM STEEN Like they support you playing sports. 

03:35:35
BRIANNA Yeah. 

03:35:35
SHERI BAUMAN And how does that feel to you? 

03:35:40
BRIANNA Good, because my parents don't really care. Well, my mom does but not my dad or step-dad or step-mom, whatever. 

03:35:45
SHERI BAUMAN So, knowing that other people encourage you to do that sort of makes up in a way? 

03:35:55
BRIANNA Yeah. 

03:35:55
SHERI BAUMAN Cool. 

03:35:55
SAM STEEN What about you Tyler? 

03:35:55
TYLER Good. 

03:36:00
SAM STEEN You're shaking your... 

03:36:00
TYLER What people were saying, it was nice. 

03:36:00
SAM STEEN How, how do you, how do you feel right now? 

03:36:05
TYLER Good that people notice that I like baseball a lot. I like it when people notice that. 

03:36:10
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. 

03:36:10
SHERI BAUMAN I don't think we've heard from Tahlia. 

03:36:15
TAHLIA Um, I don't know. Like, they made me feel that I was strong or whatever. 

03:36:30
ALEJANDRA Or whatever. 

03:36:30
SAM STEEN That they made you feel like you were strong? 

03:36:35
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:36:35
ALEJANDRA What do you mean by that? 

03:36:40
TAHLIA That when I moved, um, people that I was with since I was, like in 1st grade. 

03:36:50
ALEJANDRA It made you feel stronger about the move? 

03:36:50
TAHLIA What? 

03:36:55
ALEJANDRA They made you feel stronger about the move? 

03:36:55
TAHLIA Yeah. No. I don't know. 

03:37:00
SAM STEEN What I heard you, do you all know what Tahlia's trying to say? 

03:37:05
TYLER Yeah. 

03:37:05
ALEJANDRA No. 

03:37:05
SAM STEEN What is she trying to say, Tyler? 

03:37:05
TYLER Uh, I think she's trying to say that, like, people like supported the fact that... 

03:37:10
SAM STEEN Well tell her. 

03:37:10
TYLER Well, that people, like, supported the fact that you were, like, strong about moving and, like, that, like, when you got to, like, Arizona and you like made new friends and, you know, weren't like completely, like destroyed or anything, or... 

03:37:30
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:37:30
TYLER Yeah. Like that. 

03:37:30
SHERI BAUMAN And for me, I don't remember exactly what I wrote there but it sounds like it wasn't, like, an automatic oh, everything's better, we're in Arizona. That you got through a really difficult year and, and now you feel, you know, like this is a place where you have friends and all the things that you lost, so that's pretty cool. 

03:37:50
SAM STEEN Were there anything in there that you, um, that stands out? Was there anything in particular in your cards that someone said about you that stands out? 

03:38:00
JUSTIN Yeah. Yeah, I gotta find it though. 

03:38:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

03:38:00
JUSTIN Um. 

03:38:05
ALEJANDRA Um, can I say mine till he finds it? 

03:38:05
SAM STEEN Bri, what about you? Did anything stand out? 

03:38:10
BRIANNA I'm a beast. 

03:38:10
SAM STEEN What do you think that means? 

03:38:15
BRIANNA That I'm good. 

03:38:15
TYLER That you're a beast in sports. 

03:38:20
BRIANNA And that I go around attacking little children and... 

03:38:20
SAM STEEN So you saw it as a positive but that stood out for you? What, did anybody, I'm gonna go back to that. Try to figure out who wrote down, what you, what they said? 

03:38:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:38:30
BRIANNA Yeah. 

03:38:30
SAM STEEN Looking at the name, right? 

03:38:35
TYLER I only know... 

03:38:35
SAM STEEN I don't want you to tell me. I just want to know did you... 

03:38:35
TYLER (crosstalk) No, but I only know, know maybe two. 

03:38:40
SAM STEEN Because of that? Oh. 

03:38:40
ALEJANDRA Can we, like, ask who wrote it? 

03:38:40
SAM STEEN I don't know. What do you think? Well, let's hear that and then we'll go... 

03:38:45
TYLER She can ask and then we can say (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:38:49
SHERI BAUMAN Or, you know what? 

03:38:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) You can decide? 

03:38:50
SHERI BAUMAN And also if there's, if there's a comment that maybe isn't clear to you, you don't understand and you wanna, you know, say I saw this and I'm not sure what it means. So can someone help me and hopefully the person who wrote it would be willing. 

03:39:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

03:39:00
SAM STEEN Open to comment. 

03:39:00
SHERI BAUMAN You wanna share the one that struck you? 

03:39:00
JUSTIN Oh, yeah. Um, like, someone wrote when your sister stopped crying when he was near her, it kinda showed that his little sister loved him from the start. That stood out to me. 

03:39:15
SAM STEEN Like a nice bond already from the beginning. 

03:39:20
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:39:20
SHERI BAUMAN And that, that struck you because? 

03:39:20
JUSTIN Um, my mom and her brother, I think their relationship is building more, because of, um, their father and his condition but I guess from the, the beginning, they weren't that close and I'm glad that me and my sister are really close. We can get along. So, that's it. 

03:39:40
ALEJANDRA Should I say mine? 

03:39:45
SAM STEEN Why you asking me? 

03:39:45
ALEJANDRA I don't know. Um, this person said. Well, I don't really get it. They said able to see, is that the? I'm guess that's good in others and made a good choice about relationships. So what do you mean about a good choice in relationships? 

03:40:05
BRIANNA Oh, that says the. 

03:40:05
ALEJANDRA The? 

03:40:05
BRIANNA Yeah. 

03:40:05
ALEJANDRA Oh. Who wrote this? 

03:40:10
SAM STEEN You're asking who wrote it? 

03:40:10
AL4EJANDRA Yeah. 

03:40:10
SAM STEEN What if we don't wanna tell you who wrote it? 

03:40:15
ALEJANDRA Why? 

03:40:15
TYLER Wait. Can you read it again? 

03:40:20
ALEJANDRA It says able to see the good in others and made a good choice about relationships. 

03:40:25
TYLER Oh. Well, that's not mine then. 

03:40:25
SAM STEEN Do you know what you, do you have any idea what that might mean? 

03:40:30
TYLER Like... 

03:40:30
SAM STEEN Based on the story, I think you told about a boyfriend or something like that? 

03:40:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah, my boyfriend. 

03:40:35
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

03:40:35
TYLER What that means? 

03:40:40
SAM STEEN Potentially. 

03:40:40
TYLER Like, I, I don't know. I don't know. 

03:40:45
ALEJANDRA I don't get it either. 

03:40:45
SAM STEEN Anybody? Wanna take a guess at what that... 

03:40:45
JUSTIN Can you repeat it? 

03:40:45
ALEJANDRA Able to see the good in others and made a good choice about relationships. 

03:40:50
JUSTIN Um. 

03:40:50
TYLER Oh. 

03:40:50
JUSTIN I think, like, it refers to, instead of always looking at the negative, like she did before she met her boyfriend and (inaudible ) let her... 

03:41:06
SAM STEEN Well, tell her. 

03:41:06
JUSTIN It let you see the positive in things, right? 

03:41:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:41:10
JUSTIN And then, like, you, it allowed you to find the good in people rather than the bad. 

03:41:15
TYLER Yeah. 

03:41:15
JUSTIN How about you Tyler? 

03:41:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Would you agree with that? 

03:41:15
JUSTIN How about you? 

03:41:20
TYLER What? 

03:41:20
JUSTIN You're quiet over there. 

03:41:25
ALEJANDRA Let's pick on Tyler. 

03:41:25
TYLER Wait, what now? 

03:41:25
BRIANNA You get to share now. 

03:41:25
TYLER Share what? 

03:41:30
BRIANNA What stood out to you most. 

03:41:30
TYLER Um, someone in here wrote that I play baseball because I enjoy it, not just 'cuz my dad wanted me to. Like my brother, he told my dad that, uh, he just played baseball 'cuz my dad wanted to, so that's why he joined football, 'cuz he wanted to play football. 

03:41:50
JUSTIN Are we allowed to guess who we think the person is? 

03:41:55
TYLER I know who wrote that down. 

03:41:55
SAM STEEN If it's meaningful enough for you to know for sure, I don't know but why did that stand out to you, Tyler? I'm curious why that stood out so much to you. 

03:42:05
TYLER Because, like, it just reminds me of my brother 'cuz it showed how my brother was playing baseball 'cuz my dad wanted him to and that just stood out to me 'cuz he did something he wanted to. 

03:42:20
SAM STEEN And that they recognized that you're doing... 

03:42:20
TYLER Baseball 'cuz I want to. 

03:42:25
SAM STEEN 'Cuz you really wanted to. I see. You were gonna share one that stood out to you? 

03:42:30
TAHLIA Um, yeah. No, I don't know what it means. 

03:42:30
SAM STEEN Just read it. 

03:42:30
TAHLIA It says it shows she is more a know everyone and I think she misses them. 

03:42:40
SAM STEEN It shows she is more... 

03:42:40
TAHLIA A know... 

03:42:40
ALEJANDRA And I wrote that. 

03:42:45
SAM STEEN A know everyone and I think she misses them. 

03:42:45
TAHLIA I don't get it. 

03:42:45
SAM STEEN I don't know either. 

03:42:50
JUSTIN Who wrote that one? 

03:42:50
ALEJANDRA I did. 

03:42:50
SHERI BAUMAN Can you help her understand it? 

03:42:50
ALEJANDRA 'Cuz you were talking about, like, your, where you lived, everyone knew each other. That's what I think. You're the type of person that wants to know everyone. Just, like you wanna know the whole neighborhood or the whole world. You know? And you, I think you miss that. 

03:43:10
TAHLIA Oh. 

03:43:10
ALEJANDRA You get it? 

03:43:10
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:43:10
SAM STEEN And your response to her is what? Well, tell her. 

03:43:15
TAHLIA Wait, what? 

03:43:20
SAM STEEN All right, did... 

03:43:20
SHERI BAUMAN She's wondering, uh, um, do you agree with that? Is that right on or is that not the way you see yourself? 

03:43:30
TAHLIA I don't know. I, I never thought myself like that but... 

03:43:35
ALEJANDRA No. 

03:43:35
SAM STEEN Do you need time to think about it? 

03:43:40
TAHLIA No. 

03:43:40
SAM STEEN Or you don't agree with it? 

03:43:40
TAHLIA No, like, I do kinda but then I don't. 

03:43:45
SAM STEEN What's so funny? What's so funny, Bri? 

03:43:50
JUSTIN She, she's just sitting there and she's, like... 

03:43:50
SAM STEEN About what? This interaction? 

03:43:55
JUSTIN I don't know. 

03:43:55
SAM STEEN Bri, what were you referring to? Of course we wanna know. I wanna know. 

03:44:00
BRIANNA I had one of my moments. 

03:44:05
JUSTIN She just looking at the card and was like... 

03:44:05
SAM STEEN Oh, an ADHD moment. Oh, okay. It had nothing to do with them? Oh, I get it. That's normal. 

03:44:10
ALEJANDRA This is frustrating me. Who wrote this? 

03:44:15
SAM STEEN Oh, well, well let's finish this one and then we'll come back to that. So Shari asked the question do you agree with that or not? 

03:44:25
TAHLIA Yes and no. 

03:44:25
SAM STEEN Yes because? 

03:44:30
TAHLIA Because, like, I like to meet new people. 

03:44:35
SAM STEEN And no because? 

03:44:35
TAHLIA 'Cuz I don't see myself meeting new people. 

03:44:40
SAM STEEN You don't go out of your way to meet new people? 

03:44:45
TAHLIA No. 

03:44:45
SAM STEEN Or you don't feel like you need to know everybody in the neighborhood? 

03:44:45
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:44:45
SAM STEEN Maybe it's just a misunderstanding but it sounds like, it, it, it could come across as being negative but it is also, sounds like it's a strength. You're saying that she wants to know other people. 

03:44:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:45:00
SHERI BAUMAN Looks like Alejandra is asking for help with one too. Bri, is that the one that you're helping with it? Is that hers or is that yours? 

03:45:05
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

03:45:05
BRIANNA Hers. 

03:45:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. Maybe everybody can help or maybe the person who wrote it. 

03:45:10
SAM STEEN Oh you mean reading it? 

03:45:15
SHERI BAUMAN I'm not sure. 

03:45:15
ALEJANDRA Oh. 

03:45:15
SAM STEEN Were you asking about this one or the other one? 

03:45:15
ALEJANDRA This one, the one. Who wrote this one? 

03:45:20
TAHLIA I know who wrote that. 

03:45:20
SAM STEEN You do? 

03:45:20
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:45:20
SAM STEEN How do you know? 

03:45:20
TAHLIA 'Cuz I just know. 

03:45:25
SAM STEEN Who wrote that one? 

03:45:25
JUSTIN I know who wrote that one. 

03:45:25
TAHLIA (crosstalk) I think that it was you. 

03:45:25
SAM STEEN I wrote it. 

03:45:30
BRIANNA Oh wow. I wouldn't have thought of that. I was thinking that... 

03:45:30
JUSTIN (crosstalk) You wrote that she was a beast. 

03:45:35
BRIANNA Yeah. 

03:45:35
SAM STEEN How would you know? 

03:45:35
JUSTIN Because. 

03:45:35
BRIANNA I can tell your handwriting. 

03:45:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:45:35
SAM STEEN Oh. 

03:45:35
JUSTIN We can tell your handwriting. 

03:45:35
TYLER Does that mean you wrote this one? 

03:45:40
SAM STEEN Not necessarily. 

03:45:40
SAM STEEN Let's stick... 

03:45:40
JUSTIN I know you, I know you wrote this one 'cuz it sounds like something a... 

03:45:45
SAM STEEN An old man would say? 

03:45:45
JUSTIN No. A, a college person would take notes and then how he wrote, how you wrote it down. 

03:45:50
SAM STEEN You mean actually the way I wrote it? 

03:45:55
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:45:55
ALEJANDRA Oh wow. 

03:45:55
JUSTIN Like a comma. You had examples and, and you had some, you had supporting, um, examples. 

03:46:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Just like an essay. 

03:46:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:46:00
SAM STEEN I gave myself away. 

03:46:05
BRIANNA See, I just wrote it and I think I spelled a lot of the words wrong, too. 

03:46:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:46:10
SAM STEEN Right. I see. Interesting. So this one, I wrote. Yes, I can own up to it. I didn't want to at first. 

03:46:15
ALEJANDRA Why? 

03:46:15
SAM STEEN Well, because I didn't want it to be so much about me but much more about you. That's why. 

03:46:20
ALEJANDRA Oh. 

03:46:20
JUSTIN You're a beast. 

03:46:20
SAM STEEN Does that help you now that you that you know who wrote it? 

03:46:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:46:30
SAM STEEN What if it would have been Tyler that wrote it? 

03:46:30
ALEJANDRA I don't know. No comment. 

03:46:35
SAM STEEN No, no. That's not what I mean. Why does it matter who wrote it? That's really my question. 

03:46:40
ALEJANDRA 'Cuz I had a feeling it was one of you. 

03:46:40
SAM STEEN The older people? 

03:46:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, 'cuz, like you said, good choice. 

03:46:45
SAM STEEN Oh, like judging your relationship. 

03:46:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah, like you were judging the people I pick, you know? 

03:46:55
SAM STEEN Oh, I, I, I appreciate you saying that 'cuz it's not really, in that respect, it, it's more not I thought you made a good choice. It sounds like you made a good choice. Does that makes sense? 

03:47:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:47:05
SAM STEEN Like for you it was a good choice. 

03:47:05
ALEJANDRA That's why it was confusing. Like... 

03:47:05
SAM STEEN Yeah, like you saw this guy that you met in detention and we even talked about was it juvenile detention or was it like school detention? 

03:47:10
ALEJANDRA Oh, no. It was school detention. 

03:47:15
SAM STEEN Exactly. So and then you became friends with him and then you started to like him as a friend and then you chose him and for you, that was a good choice versus not me saying oh, that's a bad choice or she should have chose someone else. Does that make sense? 

03:47:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:47:30
SAM STEEN You sure? 

03:47:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah, it does. 

03:47:30
SHERI BAUMAN So what interests me about doing this is that, um, it's always nice to get feedback from other people but if you're not sure, it can, it can have, be sort of a double edged sword and that sometimes we mean something and we think we know what we're saying but the other person doesn't receive it in the same way that we send it. So it's important to clarify because otherwise we may be either thinking about it a lot or misunderstanding and have our feelings hurt. So I hope if that happens in here, which you took it upon yourselves already, that if, if something, someone says something and you're not sure what they meant or kinda get your feelings hurt, that we say so. 'Cuz that's a big part of trust and we talked a little bit about trust once. 

03:48:20
TYLER And Tyler, you were trying to figure out whether or not I wrote one of yours based on the color, right? 

03:48:25
TYLER Mm-hmm. 

03:48:25
SAM STEEN But no. I wrote a pink one for you. 

03:48:25
TYLER Is it this one? 

03:48:30
SAM STEEN Yeah, I did. 

03:48:30
SHERI BAUMAN So we have a, a little time left today and we've been coming up with strategies, games, techniques to help the conversation go but I'm getting the sense that you may not need all that and we had talked at the beginning about gee, high school's coming up. We talked about race and culture. We talked about your at an age where you're starting to move away from families in some ways. There were lots of things that we could talk about or that you, um, might not need our structure to do. So we thought we'd leave the time today for you to talk about whatever's important to you. What of, what would you like to spend this time to, talking about? 

03:49:20
ALEJANDRA I wanna talk about high school. 

03:49:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

03:49:25
JUSTIN Yeah, so do I. I really wanna talk about high school too. 

03:49:25
ALEJANDRA I'm, like, curious to know if you're either excited or sad or what are your feelings towards going to high school? Tyler and Bri. 

03:49:35
BRIANNA (crosstalk) I'm a little sad and a little excited because I don't wanna leave my middle school because I have, like, so many great memories there and I have a lot of friends. 

03:49:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:49:45
BRIANNA And a lot of the teachers are really nice and some of 'em not so much. 

03:49:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:49:50
BRIANNA Revenge on the last day of school. 

03:49:55
JUSTIN No one gets revenge on the last day of school. 

03:50:00
BRIANNA And then... 

03:50:00
JUSTIN Last year. 

03:50:00
BRIANNA I'm excited because we get to go meet new people, meet new teachers, and walk (inaudible ) for the rest of your life. So. 

03:50:07
ALEJANDRA What were you saying Justin? 

03:50:10
JUSTIN Oh, nothing. Never mind. I didn't say anything. 

03:50:10
SHERI BAUMAN But you said that that, that topic is important to you. What... 

03:50:15
JUSTIN Oh. Um, I'm excited to go to high school. Um, Taylor, my best friend, he's a freshman at South Point, you know. Our parents have always said that they wanna keep us together throughout, um, high school. 

03:50:30
ALEJANDRA Oh, yeah. 

03:50:30
JUSTIN And play sports together. Um, I'm a lineman and he's a running back but since we got older, your positions will change and he's at middle linebacker, starting on varsity as a freshman and, and this is an undefeated, well, they lost one game and this is, they beat every team in Tuscon and, uh, the head coach wants me to go there and play football and it's a good education. Southpoint Catholic School and, um, I'm really excited to take that next step in, in life. You know? Grow a little bit more. 

03:51:05
SHERI BAUMAN How do you guys think high school's gonna be different? 

03:51:05
TAHLIA I'm gonna be a loner. 

03:51:10
SHERI BAUMAN You're gonna be what? 

03:51:10
TAHLIA A loner. 

03:51:10
JUSTIN You're gonna be lonely? Why would you wanna do that? 

03:51:10
TAHLIA Because I won't know anyone. 

03:51:15
ALEJANDRA That's where she (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:51:19
SHERI BAUMAN Don't most of the kids from your middle school go to the same high school? 

03:51:20
TAHLIA But I'm not gonna go to Triad (ph). 

03:51:20
SHERI BAUMAN So you're gonna go to a different school? 

03:51:25
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:51:25
JUSTIN What school are you going to? 

03:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) And how did you choose where to go? 

03:51:30
TAHLIA I didn't. 

03:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. Did someone help you choose or make the choice? 

03:51:35
TAHLIA Yeah, my mom did. 

03:51:35
JUSTIN What high school you going to? 

03:51:35
TAHLIA Tuscon High. 

03:51:35
JUSTIN Oh. 

03:51:35
ALEJANDRA Tuscon High. 

03:51:40
JUSTIN Magnet school for science reason? 

03:51:40
TAHLIA No. 

03:51:40
JUSTIN Oh. Just because it's close to where you live? 

03:51:45
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Art. No. It's not close. 

03:51:50
ALEJANDRA It's far. 

03:51:50
TAHLIA No, but she works there too. 

03:51:50
JUSTIN Oh. 

03:51:50
SHERI BAUMAN So is that good news or bad news? 

03:51:55
TAHLIA I don't know. It's good, I guess. But she said either San Miguel, Southpoint, or Southpoint or Tuscon High. Those were my only choices. 

03:52:05
SAM STEEN What'd you say? I didn't hear. 

03:52:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:52:10
TAHLIA What? 

03:52:10
SAM STEEN Someone was whispering under their breath. 

03:52:15
TYLER I said why wouldn't you choose Southpoint? 

03:52:20
TYLER Yeah. 

03:52:20
JUSTIN Are you going to Southpoint? 

03:52:20
TYLER (crosstalk) Yeah, I would have chose Southpoint. It's a Catholic school. 

03:52:20
TYLER (crosstalk inaudible ). 

03:52:21
JUSTIN (inaudible ). 

03:52:24
TAHLIA But, I don't know. 

03:52:25
SAM STEEN Did you wanna hear her response? 

03:52:25
TYLER Yeah. 

03:52:30
TAHLIA You have to pay to get in. 

03:52:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:52:30
TYLER That's true. 

03:52:30
SAM STEEN You have to pay to get in? It's a private school? 

03:52:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

03:52:35
TYLER Yeah. 

03:52:35
JUSTIN It's like, I mean, my family isn't the wealthiest family, um, but they have, like, financial aid for stuff and, like, you play baseball right? And that, Southpoint also has a great, uh, baseball program and they offer scholarships to help pay for, um, whatever you are involved in and help you get into the school. 

03:53:00
SHERI BAUMAN So Tahlia's going to Tuscon High though, which is a very big, new school, um, and not knowing people feels scary? 

03:53:05
SAM STEEN Lonely? 

03:53:10
TAHLIA Yeah, lonely. 

03:53:10
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. 

03:53:10
SHERI BAUMAN Now think about when you came here and you started middle school and you said once you did that, you made friends and felt a lot better. What skills did you use that you could take with you to high school? 

03:53:25
TAHLIA Um, I don't know. I talk a lot. 

03:53:25
SAM STEEN You don't or you do. 

03:53:30
TAHLIA Do talk a lot. 

03:53:30
SAM STEEN Oh, that helps? 

03:53:30
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:53:30
SHERI BAUMAN Like to people in your classes or? 

03:53:35
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:53:35
SHERI BAUMAN So you start there and then sometimes you get to know other people? 

03:53:40
TAHLIA Mm-hmm. 

03:53:40
SAM STEEN Alejandra had made a comment about her saying something about being lonely but I wasn't sure what she said. 

03:53:45
ALEJANDRA Did I? 

03:53:50
SAM STEEN Yes. I think you were referring to the card though again. 

03:53:50
ALEJANDRA Oh, no. Oh, 'cuz like I might go to Tuscon High so... 

03:53:55
SAM STEEN You knew that? 

03:54:00
TAHLIA Yeah. 

03:54:00
ALEJANDRA Hopefully we have classes together. And also one of our friends go there. 

03:54:05
TAHLIA Oh yeah, Javier (ph). 

03:54:05
SAM STEEN So at least you know potentially one person or two people there. 

03:54:10
SHERI BAUMAN So you, you said this topic was important to you so you're excited? 

03:54:15
ALEJANDRA Yes. I'm really excited. I wanna, I wanna see where, if I'm gonna be successful hopefully. You know, I just, I wanna see how my life is gonna end up. Like, I, in Tucson High, there's like so many opportunities, like so many different choices and I think that's what I need is like try this, just little bit. Like I looked at all the high schools and Tuscon High has a lot of options for me and I think that's good 'cuz I gotta, I don't wanna stick with one. You know, I just wanna see everything and then choose, you know? Yeah. 

03:54:55
SHERI BAUMAN So you're gonna try to take advantage of all that? 

03:54:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:55:00
SHERI BAUMAN It's like, yeah, going from middle school to a, and Tuscon High is enormous. 

03:55:05
SAM STEEN I'm sure. 

03:55:05
ALEJANDRA It is. 

03:55:05
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk inaudible ). It's bigger than some colleges. It's an enormous school. 

03:55:10
JUSTIN How old is it? 

03:55:10
SHERI BAUMAN I don't know but it's... 

03:55:10
ALEJANDRA It's 50 years. 

03:55:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, it's... 

03:55:10
JUSTIN No, it's older than 50 years. 

03:55:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah, it's like... 

03:55:10
TYLER (crosstalk) Yeah, it's old. 

03:55:15
JUSTIN It has, it has, like, because it has that 100 thing on it. 

03:55:15
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:55:15
JUSTIN And that was, well that 100 thing was placed there, like, a while ago. 

03:55:20
SAM STEEN So we're talking about high school. So is it just transitioning to high school that's causing you, like, feel, worried about being lonely or a little bit scared or making new friends but what else about high school, if that's an important topic. What else about it? 

03:55:35
BRIANNA The teachers. 

03:55:35
SAM STEEN That you may interact with, like (inaudible ) teachers. 

03:55:42
BRIANNA Mm-hmm. 

03:55:42
JUSTIN School. 

03:55:42
SAM STEEN In what way? 

03:55:42
BRIANNA Well, like their teaching abilities. Because there's some teachers who I don't understand and I can't learn from. 

03:55:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Follow. 

03:55:50
BRIANNA And then there's some that are rude. 

03:55:55
SAM STEEN So personality differences maybe but also learning new teachers and their teaching style? 

03:56:00
JUSTIN School. 

03:56:05
SHERI BAUMAN You mean the, the academic parts. 

03:56:05
JUSTIN (crosstalk) The academic work at Southpoint is accelerated and it's hard. 

03:56:10
SHERI BAUMAN So maybe more homework and more... 

03:56:15
JUSTIN That's the only thing I'm nervous about but I go to a Catholic school now so I think... 

03:56:20
SAM STEEN It's preparing you for it? 

03:56:20
ALEJANDRA I haven't heard from Tyler. 

03:56:20
JUSTIN Yeah. So Tyler. 

03:56:25
ALEJANDRA So quiet. 

03:56:25
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Both Tylers, actually. 

03:56:25
TYLER Um, I'm excited for high school 'cuz that's like where sports start getting bigger and that's where sports start counting more. That's where you gotta push it and then so school's gonna help me a lot 'cuz I need to push it in school in order to be able to push it for the sports. And, but then I'm also sad because I have, um, three of my best friends are leaving to go to Southpoint and I can't afford Southpoint so that disappoints me. 

03:56:55
SHERI BAUMAN So do you envision being able to maintain your friendships even though you're not at the same school? 

03:57:00
TYLER Yeah. 

03:57:00
SHERI BAUMAN It's a little harder but sometimes we can manage that. What about you Tyler? What are your thoughts about high school? 

03:57:10
TYLER I, I'm just excited 'cuz, for me, I know all my, most of my friends, well, all my friends are going to Mount View 'cuz, you know, like all my, my whole middle school is the only school that goes in the Mount View so I think it's, I, I, I'm just looking forward to, like, you know high school and having more, like freedoms and playing high school sports and, uh, yeah, so. 'Cuz I don't think it's gonna be, like, an issue with having to, like, make new friends or anything 'cuz it's mostly the same people. So, yeah. Just excited. 

03:57:45
SHERI BAUMAN And are there some other schools that feed in or is yours the only middle school? 

03:57:50
TYLER I think mine's the only middle school yeah. They changed it. 

03:57:50
JUSTIN I think, um, Cross does too. 

03:57:55
TYLER No Cross goes to CDO. 

03:57:55
TYLER (crosstalk) Cross is CDO. 

03:57:55
JUSTIN Oh. 

03:57:55
TYLER Yeah. 

03:57:55
SAM STEEN When I hear you say excited, you are using the words I'm excited but you don't sound excited. Did anybody else pick up on that? 

03:58:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

03:58:05
SAM STEEN You too? 

03:58:10
JUSTIN Yeah. Where's the enthusiasm? 

03:58:10
ALEJANDRA He's like, I'm excited. 

03:58:10
TYLER I'm excited. 

03:58:15
SAM STEEN Well I didn't know if maybe you were really nervous or something else. You know? 

03:58:20
TYLER Ah, I think the only thing I'm nervous about is sports. Like, if I'm gonna make like varsity teams and stuff. You know, 'cuz there's lots of competition so I'm kinda, I'm nervous about that but that's about it. 

03:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN So I hear that some people are going to schools where they already know people and you've already kinda, um, familiarized yourself. Like in your case, you haven't been to Southpoint but you've been to a Catholic school, so you kinda have the idea but for some of you, you're really going to new territory and even though it sounds exciting, you're not, you know, you don't know the teachers. You don't know exactly how to decide what classes to take or all of that. So it's a big step. We're, we're, some of you said more freedoms. What's freer at high school do you think? 

03:59:10
JUSTIN Driving. 

03:59:10
SHERI BAUMAN You get to drive? 

03:59:15
JUSTIN I'm looking forward to that. Like, I'm turning 14 soon and then 15 and that's when you get your permit and I'm excited. 

03:59:20
TYLER Yeah. I'm excited 'cuz, uh, once you get like a certain amount of high school credits, um, Mount, the high school's right by, like, this big complex of, like, like, places to eat and like all the stores so, uh, you, they let you leave for lunch. You can, like, go and, uh, go there. 

03:59:40
JUSTIN So does Southpoint. 

03:59:40
TYLER Yeah, you can go to, like, Subway or something for lunch. I, I'm excited for, like, that, like, kind of freedoms and stuff. 

03:59:45
JUSTIN Doesn't Mountain View, like, don't you get to have like a 2.8 or something in order to drive, GPA? 

03:59:55
TYLER (inaudible ) me? 

03:59:57
JUSTIN Yeah. You have to have like a certain GPA in order for them to let you drive? 

04:00:00
TYLER I have no idea. 

04:00:00
JUSTIN That's what I heard. 

04:00:00
SHERI BAUMAN So there's something to be talked about in getting to know new people in a new situation other than the two people here who knew each other before. How did you, how do you think you've done at, you know, getting acquainted and making friends with this group? 

04:00:20
TYLER Good. 

04:00:20
ALEJANDRA Wait, what was the question? Sorry. 

04:00:25
SHERI BAUMAN As you think about going to a school with a lot of people that you don't know, one of the things is always how am I gonna, you know, pick new friends and make friends and, um, you know, Tahlia talked about well, I don't know anybody, but you really didn't know anybody here. How do you think you did in terms of getting along? 

04:00:40
TAHLIA Um, I don't know. Like, okay, I guess. Yeah. It took a while. 

04:00:45
SAM STEEN You think it took a while? 

04:00:50
TAHLIA I think. 

04:00:50
SAM STEEN Just a day? 

04:00:50
ALEJANDRA I think it was fast to get to know each other. 

04:00:55
SHERI BAUMAN Like, how come? 

04:01:00
ALEJANDRA I don't know. Like, um, like, when we're talking about personal stuff. 

04:01:10
SHERI BAUMAN So sharing things about yourself is one way to feel closer to people. 

04:01:20
TYLER I think that the way to make friends is, like, just talking 'cuz, like, the first time you meet someone, you're always, like, everyone's kind of like nervous and, like, no one, like, really says anything but, you know, everyone has, like, something to say just no one's saying anything. So, like, you just have to, like, talk 'cuz, like, most of the time people will, like, have something to say but somebody has to just, like, break the ice. 

04:01:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Like, you have to be willing to talk to get to know a person is all. 

04:01:55
JUSTIN I think who broke the ice is you. 

04:01:55
TYLER Yeah. 

04:01:55
SAM STEEN Alejandra? Alejandra? 

04:02:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:02:00
TYLER (crosstalk) Yeah. 

04:02:00
SAM STEEN You remember that? 

04:02:00
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:02:04
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:02:04
SHERI BAUMAN And what way did she... 

04:02:04
SAM STEEN Do you remember that Tyler? Tyler's shaking his head too. 

04:02:05
TYLER Yeah. 

04:02:05
SHERI BAUMAN How so? 

04:02:05
TYLER Just like asking questions like do you read books or do you play video games, like, listen to music. Stuff like that. Just like... 

04:02:15
SAM STEEN She was helping facilitate the conversation. Maybe she's a counselor. Bri, what'd you think? 

04:02:20
BRIANNA What? 

04:02:20
SAM STEEN Did you have another moment? 

04:02:25
BRIANNA Yeah, a little bit. 

04:02:25
SAM STEEN Moment. Tyler, you were shaking your head about, uh, Alejandra as well, too. 

04:02:30
TYLER Yeah, she's, she was just being herself. Like that's what I was gonna say. 

04:02:35
SAM STEEN You should tell her. 

04:02:35
TYLER Just by being yourself, it helped break it. Like I said, we all just have to be ourself and that's how we all became so, became closer. 

04:02:40
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you know, um, 

04:02:45
SAM STEEN I wanna, I wanna to cut you off but Alejandra, it looked like you got teary eyed earlier, just a second. 

04:02:50
ALEJANDRA No, I was yawning. 

04:02:50
SAM STEEN Were you yawning? 

04:02:50
ALEJANDRA Yawning. 

04:02:50
SAM STEEN Okay. Go ahead. 

04:02:55
SHERI BAUMAN I was gonna say when you pointed out the things that she had done, one of them was asking questions. So sometimes a way to get to know people is to ask things and find out what you have in common and what you don't. What would you say that everybody in, in this room has in common besides that we're all in this room and we're all here this weekend and all those obvious things? 

04:03:15
BRIANNA Same age. 

04:03:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, you're all almost exactly the same age. What else? 

04:03:20
JUSTIN School is, looks, it seems to be a big part of all of our lives. Well, I hope it would be for everybody or sports or something. 

04:03:35
TYLER Yeah. 

04:03:35
JUSTIN Outside school activities like you, you like to draw, right? So do you like to do an art class or something? 

04:03:40
TAHLIA I've never been in an art class. 

04:03:45
JUSTIN You just do it by yourself? 

04:03:45
TAHLIA Yeah. 

04:03:45
JUSTIN What about you? You play football. He plays baseball. You play baseball and softball. What do you like to do? 

04:03:55
ALEJANDRA Um, any sport. I like to watch it and play it (inaudible ). Like a school sport. 

04:04:03
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

04:04:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah, like Playstation, X-Box, video games is a sport, I guess.

TYLER Yeah. Be good to be, like, paid to be a professional video gamer. 

04:04:15
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) I don't know how to play that. Yeah. 

04:04:20
SHERI BAUMAN Tahlia, I'ms curious. Would you like to take an art class? You said you never have. Is that something that maybe at high school you look forward to, 'cuz they usually have some pretty cool art classes. 

04:04:30
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

04:04:30
JUSTIN Like technical design or drawing? 

04:04:35
TAHLIA Like drawing with pencils. 

04:04:35
ALEJANDRA You should see her drawings. They're really artistic. 

04:04:40
SHERI BAUMAN Where did you see them? 

04:04:40
ALEJANDRA She, she lives like two streets away from me? 

04:04:45
SHERI BAUMAN Oh really? 

04:04:45
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

04:04:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Well, and you guys are friends anyway. 

04:04:50

04:04:50
SAM STEEN Well maybe you can bring one. 

04:04:55
ALEJANDRA She can, like, draw you, like literally draw you. Like my sister was on her iPod. 

04:05:00
SAM STEEN Really? She can... 

04:05:00
ALEJANDRA And she was sitting down and she drew her. 

04:05:05
JUSTIN You gonna draw like that? 

04:05:05
TYLER That's cool. I, I... 

04:05:10
ALEJANDRA It's not, it's like not perfect. It's like (inaudible ) in a way. 

04:05:11
JUSTIN (crosstalk) That's, like, artist, professional artist. 

04:05:11
TYLER And you've never taken a... 

04:05:11
BRIANNA I can draw stick people. 

04:05:11
TYLER Me too. That's all I can draw. 

04:05:20
JUSTIN That's like professional artist things right there. 

04:05:20
TYLER Drawing opens up, like, so many windows to, like, so many things. 

04:05:25
TAHLIA Yeah. 

04:05:25
TYLER Like, believe it or not, even in school. Like you have to, like, do, draw pictures like, to like do stuff and I hate it 'cuz I can never like draw anything. And I draw stick people and they make me put clothes on them and stuff. 

04:05:40
SAM STEEN God bless you. 

04:05:40
ALEJANDRA Bless you. 

04:05:45
TYLER It's all bad. 

04:05:45
ALEJANDRA Can I say something? 

04:05:45
SAM STEEN Why do you keep asking me? 

04:05:45
ALEJANDRA I don't know. Okay, you know how you said god bless you? 

04:05:50
SAM STEEN Oh, yeah. 

04:05:50
ALEJANDRA Do you guys know why they say god bless you? You do? 

04:05:55
SAM STEEN Maybe. 

04:05:55
ALEJANDRA Why do they say it? 

04:05:55
SAM STEEN No, no. Do you know. Anybody know? 

04:06:00
ALEJANDRA Do you guys know? 

04:06:00
TYLER I don't know. 

04:06:00
ALEJANDRA I don't remember the exact year but, like, in the 1800's, they would say god bless you 'cuz they thought that you had a demon or something bad inside you so they would say god bless you to kick out the... 

04:06:10
JUSTIN Oh yeah. I remember hearing that. I heard that before. 

04:06:15
TYLER (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:06:16
BRIANNA (crosstalk) Oh, yeah. 

04:06:16
SAM STEEN Does it bother you when people say god bless you? 

04:06:16
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) No. no. It's just like (inaudible ) 'cuz I think he, someone sneezed earlier. 

04:06:20
SAM STEEN He keeps sneezing. 

04:06:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. And you're like god bless you. 

04:06:25
JUSTIN My, my grandpa doesn't like to say god bless you. He says, uh, gesundheit or something. 

04:06:30
SAM STEEN It's the same thing. It's just in German. 

04:06:30
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) It's German for health. It just means healthiness kind of. 

04:06:30
TYLER Gesundheit? 

04:06:35
JUSTIN Uh-huh. 

04:06:35
TYLER That's cool. 

04:06:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. You kept on saying it and I was like wanting to say it but it was, like, off subject so I didn't say it. 

04:06:40
SAM STEEN Oh, I hear you. You don't have to ask. You can just say it. If Bri can have moments, you can ask questions that are random. 

04:06:45
SHERI BAUMAN So we're almost out of time for, um, today. How should we end? We've been directing all these things. We always like to hear from everybody at the end of session. 

04:06:55

04:07:20
ALEJANDRA Oh. 

04:07:20
SHERI BAUMAN So what would be a good way to end? You know, just some little thing that we can say at the... 

04:07:25
ALEJANDRA We should play a game. Like a quick game.

ALEJANDRA Yeah, something like that. 

04:07:35
TYLER That game's fun. 

04:07:35
SAM STEEN I don't know if we can do that. 

04:07:35
SHERI BAUMAN I don't know, I don't know how to... 

04:07:35
SAM STEEN Without, don't you need a table?

SAM STEEN Do you all agree with that? 

04:08:00
ALEJANDRA What's that one, that one game though? What's that one game? It's like questions but it's not 20 questions. 

04:08:10
JUSTIN Twenty-one questions? 

04:08:10
ALEJANDRA Something like that but I don't think it's... 

04:08:10
TYLER (crosstalk inaudible ) for that. 

04:08:14
ALEJANDRA But I don't think it's that one. I don't know. 

04:08:15
SAM STEEN So we have Simon Says, heads up, seven up, and... 

04:08:20

JUSTIN Yes. 

04:09:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

04:09:52
SAM STEEN That's you, Tyler. 

04:09:52
TYLER Oh, I have to go? 

04:09:52
SAM STEEN Yeah. You got it right. 

04:09:55
TYLER Oh, I can't even think of anything. Okay. Um. 

04:10:00
SAM STEEN Professor. 

04:10:00
TYLER No. 

04:10:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

04:10:05
TYLER I'm trying to think here. 

04:10:05
SAM STEEN Oh. 

04:10:05
TYLER Um. I have no idea. 

04:10:10
BRIANNA A confused (inaudible ). 

04:10:14
TYLER Um. 

04:10:15
ALEJANDRA You can't talk. Running. 

04:10:20
TYLER There you go. 

04:10:20
SHERI BAUMAN All right, well. 

04:10:20
SAM STEEN So it sounds like you guys wanted to giggle and laugh a little bit as a way to end and that's nice. 

04:10:25
TYLER (crosstalk) Yes. 

04:10:25
JUSTIN What about, won that one? 

04:10:30
ALEJANDRA Me. 

04:10:30
SAM STEEN Well yeah, but we only have one minute left. 

04:10:35
JUSTIN Oh. 

04:10:35
SAM STEEN I'm looking at the clock, so. 

04:10:35
SHERI BAUMAN So, we will see you next week. 

04:10:40
ALEJANDRA Can we keep these? 

04:10:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yes. I think so. 

04:10:40
SAM STEEN Yeah. Do you wanna keep them? 

04:10:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:10:40
SAM STEEN Was anybody offended by anything that they heard today? 

04:10:45
UNKNOWN Nope. 

04:10:45
SAM STEEN Nothing that they felt like, um... 

04:10:45
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

04:10:45
SAM STEEN You were? 

04:10:45
ALEJANDRA I'm kidding. No. 

04:10:45
SAM STEEN You're just kidding? Okay. 

04:10:50
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

04:10:50
SAM STEEN All right. Yes or no? 

04:10:50
BRIANNA Were you really? 

04:10:50
ALEJANDRA Yes I was. 

04:10:50
SAM STEEN Well, we have some time. What were you offended about? 

04:10:55
ALEJANDRA Paulio, my friend. 

04:10:55
SAM STEEN Oh, your (inaudible ). 

04:11:00
ALEJANDRA She told me something I did not know. So... 

04:11:00
SAM STEEN All righty. Well, we, maybe if we have time next time well talk about that because that's a big one. 

04:11:05
ALEJANDRA It was. It was like oh my god. 

04:11:10
SAM STEEN Can you wait, can you wait a week? Can you wait till next week to talk about it? Please? 

04:11:10
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

04:11:10
SAM STEEN Thank you. Okay. See you next week. 

04:11:15
ALEJANDRA Okay. Can we go now? 

04:11:20
SAM STEEN Just promise me you won't talk to, till next week. 

04:11:20
ALEJANDRA I won't. 

04:11:20
SAM STEEN Okay, thanks. See you next week.

Session 5 Processing 

04:11:35
[music] 

04:11:35
SHERI BAUMAN So what'd you think? 

04:11:35
SAM STEEN About anything in particular? Overall? 

04:11:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, overall. It was... 

04:11:45
SAM STEEN Overall, I enjoyed them thinking through those cards. You know what I mean? Like, it seemed like they owned it, if you will. Like it was meaningful to them. What I hadn't picked up on until the very end of the session was that, was there any card in there that you felt was whatever the word would have been. Controversial or that you didn't agree with and if we would have done that a little bit earlier, who knows where we could have ended up. But maybe we'll have our opportunity to do that next time, at least. I don't know. 

04:12:25
SHERI BAUMAN It sounds like in general, they're, they're focused on the more external kinds of attributes but when you think about the incidents were in some cases, that fit. 

04:12:40
SAM STEEN Based on what has happened to them? 

04:12:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. And what, and what they chose, you know, what's important in their lives. 

04:12:45
SAM STEEN Oh, I see. 

04:12:45
SHERI BAUMAN So. 

04:12:50
SAM STEEN Yeah. Overall, how are you feeling? This is session five. 

04:12:55
SHERI BAUMAN I think they're becoming more cohesive. I think they're becoming more independent, even though Ale keeps asking you if it's okay. I think they're beginning to, you know, inviting someone who's, who's more quiet, checking out with each other. So I'm, um, I'm pleased with that and maybe, I'm always interested to see if they're ready to go a little deeper, so. 

04:13:20
SAM STEEN And I would agree with that, as far as going deeper. I found it interesting the terminology they used regarding Tyler, the other Tyler. There's two Tyler S's, but the one about you're quiet Tyler. Um, let's pick on Tyler. They even said the word pick and he didn't get offended by it but, he again rarely chimes in when he's asked to. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:13:45
SHERI BAUMAN Rather than invite, they... 

04:13:45
SAM STEEN Yeah, yeah. It was, they go after him. You know? A few of 'em. So how do we get them to, to go deeper? 

04:13:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I, I guess I assume that a, if we choose the right activities and b, help with the processing, um, making sure that we're asking them to think about things. 

04:14:05
SAM STEEN When we opened it up for them to explore the topic that they chose, it was high school. Maybe that doesn't lend itself, or any topic could lend itself. 

04:14:15
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. 

04:14:15
SAM STEEN It depends but they didn't explore it on a very deep level. 

04:14:20
SHERI BAUMAN Although for Tahlia, maybe so. I mean, more about I'm gonna be alone. 

04:14:25
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

04:14:25
SHERI BAUMAN But we didn't (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:14:30
SAM STEEN I asked Tyler about his emotional sort of reaction because he, it was that oh, I'm excited but he really, I don't know if I heard it in his tone or his body language but he was apparently nervous about something, which makes sense, but I don't know. So you're saying if we pick the right activity, it potentially...Well, what were we thinking was the next one? 

04:14:50
SHERI BAUMAN We, I can't remember. I think it was... 

04:14:50
SAM STEEN There's the, the circles of myself and the quadrant. 

04:14:55
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) And words that...Yeah. And maybe we, which of those do you think is more likely? 

04:14:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) I don't know. I don't know. Whichever one is the easiest to facilitate I would say. 

04:15:00
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I think the quadrant is not only easy to facilitate, it, it lends itself to some deeper exploration. 

04:15:05
SAM STEEN So let's go with that and the other one has more of a getting to know you feel as well, anyhow. 

04:15:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, although I think, uh, you talked about it. It, it could potentially be more intense but it has lots of lots of steps. 

04:15:20
SAM STEEN Oh, that's right. 

04:15:25
SHERI BAUMAN And I think we wanna keep to the time frame because realistically in the real world, we don't have open ended. 

04:15:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:15:31
SHERI BAUMAN So I think that would be maybe most direct and has the potential. What about our style together? 

04:15:45
SAM STEEN I was thinking the same thing. We hadn't talked about that. Um, I feel very comfortable. I, I think I mentioned last time how I was so wrapped up into facilitating that I could rely on you to do the processing. This time is was a little bit easier because we just allowed them to talk about those cards initially and then when we shifted to sort of what would you like to talk about then they, um, talked about high school and they began to ask each other questions and we tried to come in. Maybe if when we do that, that we allow them to, maybe even prompt them so Alejandra ask such and such what that was like versus us doing it. 

04:16:30
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Okay. 

04:16:30
SAM STEEN Maybe giving them the words to do that, that might help. 

04:16:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

04:16:30
SAM STEEN And that doesn't really speak to the process, sort of our interaction or our leadership style but more just how we can keep passing the buck 'cuz I think that's a good idea, to keep moving it to them. 

04:16:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

04:16:45
SAM STEEN Because they do it but they do it more on a surface level. 

04:16:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

04:16:45
SAM STEEN They just ask the question. 

04:16:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. And they don't know how to some extent. Maybe that, we need to model that. 

04:16:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Model that. 

04:16:50
SHERI BAUMAN Move from modeling to coaching. 

04:16:55
SAM STEEN Exactly. That's exactly, would you agree with that? That's, that's a good way of saying it. But that's the only sort of feedback I have or thought about that. And yourself? 

04:17:05
SHERI BAUMAN I think we, we take each other's cues pretty well. There's no point where I felt like we lost, you know, the, that, the flow or a sense of where each other was going and if I did, I would ask you. 

04:17:20
SAM STEEN Oh for sure, yeah. It seems easy to co-lead with you. You know? (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:17:25
SHERI BAUMAN You know I noticed the kids are not asking us to participate again. 

04:17:25
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

04:17:25
SHERI BAUMAN So that's kind of interesting and I don't know in the quadrants whether that's something we should model, 'cuz that's a little bit stickier. What do you think before we end this time? 

04:17:35
SAM STEEN I would say we should be prepared to but, sort of like with the activities. We participated but we didn't put ourselves in there. Meaning we wrote down comments about them. So is there any way... 

04:17:45
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. But in the early things, we did do our name tags and a couple of those. 

04:17:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Right, I understand. 

04:17:50
SHERI BAUMAN And I'm wondering then if, how we wanna do the quadrant. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:18:02
SAM STEEN Well let's look at the activity and see how we can participate without stealing the show if that makes any sense. 

04:18:05
SHERI BAUMAN Right, right. Yeah. 

04:18:05
SAM STEEN Is that good? 

04:18:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

04:18:05
SAM STEEN Okay. 

04:18:05
SHERI BAUMAN K? 

04:18:10
SAM STEEN Till next time, huh?

[music] 

04:18:25
SAM STEEN Well welcome back everybody. 

04:18:25
BRIANNA Hi. 

04:18:30
UNKNOWN Hello. 

04:18:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk inaudible ) When we, do you recall how we ended our session last time? Anybody remember? 

04:18:35
TYLER Played charades. 

04:18:40
SAM STEEN Yes. We were playing charades. 

04:18:40
TYLER Yeah. 

04:18:40
SAM STEEN And then I made the mistake of saying oh, oh, one more thing. Did anybody read a card that they felt like... 

04:18:50
JUSTIN Oh, yeah, yeah. 

04:18:50
SAM STEEN What? 

04:18:50
JUSTIN I wanna hear what she said. 

04:18:50
SAM STEEN What was it? What was it? Felt like what? 

04:18:55
JUSTIN Um, climax of the thing. 

04:19:00
SAM STEEN Climax. What were you thinking Tyler? 

04:19:00
TYLER (inaudible ). 

04:19:03
SAM STEEN You had your hand up. 

04:19:03
TYLER No. 

04:19:03
ALEJANDRA If I disagreed with something or I got offended. 

04:19:05
SAM STEEN Yeah, if you read something that you found offensive or that you disagree with. I brought it up because I thought Tyler was gonna say something I wrote on his was offensive. 

04:19:15
TYLER No, it wasn't offensive. It was... 

04:19:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) You weren't? 

04:19:15
TYLER I just, I, nothing. It was nothing. I just... 

04:19:20
SAM STEEN No, I thought, 'cuz I wrote on there, uh, a, it's a comment that I thought maybe you would have found offensive. That's why I asked you that. 

04:19:25
TYLER Nope. 

04:19:25
SAM STEEN I'm glad to hear that but we did have someone who said yes, there was one and she promised she would talk about it last, this week. Did you guys talk about it? 

04:19:35
JUSTIN Yes she did. 

04:19:35
TYLER No. 

04:19:35
SAM STEEN Yes or no? 

04:19:35
JUSTIN No she didn't. 

04:19:35
TAHLIA No she didn't. 

04:19:40
SAM STEEN Okay. Thanks for doing that. So you wanna read the card to us or what? 

04:19:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. It says I know you said he changed your life but I did too. Ha ha ha. JK. But you guys are cute. When we were testing Corrina, a friend of ours, wanted him to sit next to her and he said no. I just thought that was nice because I, Tahlia, think Corrina flirts with him. Oh, ha ha ha. 

04:20:05
SAM STEEN So that wasn't, that's offensive or? 

04:20:05
ALEJANDRA No, like it's like I didn't know that. Like... 

04:20:10
SAM STEEN Oh, tell her that. 

04:20:10
ALEJANDRA It was shocking 'cuz, like, Corrina, you know? It's Corrina and she's just flirting with Jesus, Jebus (ph). It's just interesting. You know? 

04:20:25
TAHLIA She does it all the time. 

04:20:25
ALEJANDRA It's nice to know. 

04:20:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible[ ). 

04:20:30
TYLER (crosstalk) Drama. 

04:20:30
SHERI BAUMAN So it wasn't... 

04:20:30
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

04:20:30
SAM STEEN We started some drama in here. 

04:20:30
ALEJANDRA No, like, I didn't, I'm not gonna confront her. I mean, if my boyfriend does do, flirt back I'm gonna get on him, not her. You know? 

04:20:40
JUSTIN Who's Corrina? 

04:20:40
ALEJANDRA Some girl at our school. 

04:20:45
TAHLIA (crosstalk) She was gonna be here. 

04:20:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, she was gonna be here, so that would have been interesting. 

04:20:45
SHERI BAUMAN So a friend that everybody knows it sounds like. So it wasn't so much that you were offended by, just the answer. 

04:20:55
ALEJANDRA Kinda, by her. 

04:20:55
SHERI BAUMAN Right, by her, but not by the person who said it. 

04:21:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:21:00
SAM STEEN Oh, I see. I misunderstood. I thought what she wrote to you was offensive. 

04:21:05
ALEJANDRA No. I was trying to tell you that but you wouldn't... 

04:21:05
SAM STEEN I wasn't listening. 

04:21:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:21:05
SAM STEEN Sorry. I apologize. You like that, huh, Bri? 

04:21:10
BRIANNA What? 

04:21:10
SAM STEEN That she kinda checked me a little bit. 

04:21:15
BRIANNA Yeah, a little. 

04:21:15
JUSTIN Where'd you get that water from? 

04:21:20
BRIANNA My house. 

04:21:20
JUSTIN Couldn't have been. 

04:21:20
BRIANNA Yeah I did. 

04:21:25
SAM STEEN So as we move on, that was it. And we'll, we'll bring closure to that sort of activity but it was something that I was curious about to see because so far, honestly, you want me to tell you how I really feel? Justin, you want me to tell you how I really feel? 

04:21:35
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:21:35
SAM STEEN I feel like you all are really nice to each other. Tyler has repeatedly said that. I think that the, the environment is safe. You feel comfortable sharing pretty much what you want to share but you've not shared anything that would be offensive or hurtful to someone else. Not that I expect you to do that but I do want you to be willing to take a risk and test it out because here's an environment where you can potentially share something, right? 

04:22:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:22:00
SAM STEEN That you can do it where it's still safe, whereas on the outside, sometimes you have to be careful how you share things that you really feel that people may find offensive. Do you follow me? 

04:22:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:22:10
TYLER Yeah. 

04:22:10
SAM STEEN You pointed to Tyler when I said that twice. What happened there? 

04:22:15
ALEJANDRA Nothing at all. 

04:22:15
TYLER I said something offensive? Like, which time? 

04:22:20
ALEJANDRA That Tyler. 

04:22:20
SAM STEEN I think it's Tyler number two. 

04:22:20
TYLER Oh yeah. 

04:22:20
JUSTIN Oh yeah, Tyler. Mr. Quiet. Not so much. 

04:22:25
ALEJANDRA Not so much. 

04:22:25
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Is it something that you... 

04:22:25
BRIANNA Not when he's on the breaks. 

04:22:25
SAM STEEN Can you please tell us what you're referring to? 

04:22:30
JUSTIN Not very quiet during the break. 

04:22:30
SAM STEEN No, I, it sounds like there's something that you all are specifically referring to. What do you think Sheri? 

04:22:35
SHERI BAUMAN I feel like I'm on the planet Mars and everybody else here is somewhere else 'cuz I don't know what you're talking about. 

04:22:40
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Bringing up. 

04:22:40
SHERI BAUMAN So what's happened is that you've become friends outside the group and you're interacting a lot and we miss out on that, so we're not always sure what looks mean or what giggles mean or any of that. So I feel... 

04:22:50
JUSTIN Exhibit A, B, and C. 

04:22:50
SHERI BAUMAN Like that. 

04:22:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Exhibit A, B, and C? Do you wanna share some of those exhibits? 

04:23:00
ALEJANDRA No. 

04:23:00
JUSTIN It'd be inappropriate. 

04:23:00
SAM STEEN It's be inappropriate? 

04:23:05
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:23:08
JUSTIN We learned that Tyler has problems. 

04:23:10
SAM STEEN Well, remember when we talked about... 

04:23:10
JUSTIN That Tyler. 

04:23:10
TYLER No, I don't have problems. 

04:23:15
SAM STEEN Well we talked about... 

04:23:15
BRIANNA (inaudible ). 

04:23:19
TYLER I run like a ninja. That's not a lie. I do run like a ninja. 

04:23:25
SAM STEEN Well we talked about, like, appropriateness. Sometimes Alejandra would say oh, is it okay if I say this and then she would say it. Was anything she said thus far inappropriate? 

04:23:35
TYLER No. 

04:23:35
SAM STEEN Not even a little bit, right? So I, I'm encouraging you, Shari you can agree or disagree, test the water. Something you feel that you think is offensive that you know, be willing to share. 

04:23:45
JUSTIN Oh, trust me. I know it's inappropriate. 

04:23:45
TAHLIA It's just mean. 

04:23:50
SAM STEEN It's just mean? 

04:23:55
TAHLIA Yeah. 

04:23:55
SAM STEEN So it wouldn't be helpful to have that conversation? 

04:24:00
UNKNOWN No. 

04:24:00
TAHLIA (crosstalk)No. 

04:24:00
JUSTIN (crosstalk) No. We can talk about exhibits but not that. 

04:24:00
SAM STEEN Okay. That's fair. Alejandra, do you agree with that? That it would be, it's not useful to hear what you're referring to? 

04:24:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:24:10
TYLER Yeah, it's not useful at all, actually. It has nothing to do with counseling whatsoever. 

04:24:15
JUSTIN (crosstalk) You need counseling. 

04:24:15
SAM STEEN Doesn't have anything to do with? Say again Justin? 

04:24:20
JUSTIN Nothing. 

04:24:20
SAM STEEN You said he, he needs counseling. 

04:24:20
TYLER I don't need counseling. That's not fair. What are you guys talking about? 

04:24:25
TYLER Can we just go on to the next (inaudible )? 

04:24:32
SAM STEEN We are going on. Yeah, we're going on.- 

04:24:32
TYLER Okay. 

04:24:32
SAM STEEN I think we're going on, don't you? 

04:24:35
SHERI BAUMAN I think we need to, yeah. 

04:24:35
JUSTIN Put this on the blooper reels. 

04:24:35
SHERI BAUMAN 'Cuz I think we (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:24:40
TYLER (crosstalk) Deleted scenes. 

04:24:40
SAM STEEN No, what I'm saying is that you're saying we should go on to what? Something more, like, unreal? 

04:24:45
ALEJANDRA What's our next... 

04:24:45
TYLER (crosstalk) Yeah, like, whatever you guys had planned. Not this. 

04:24:50
SAM STEEN Not this? Because, is this uncomfortable for you? 

04:24:50
TYLER Yes. 

04:24:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:24:55
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:25:00
SAM STEEN And so this is uncomfortable for you? Who's uncomfortable? Who's uncomfortable right now? 

04:25:05
JUSTIN My hand is uncomfortable. 

04:25:05
SHERI BAUMAN I am, frankly, for very different reasons probably than they are. 

04:25:10
SAM STEEN Why are you uncomfortable? 

04:25:10
SHERI BAUMAN 'Cuz I don't know what's going on. 

04:25:10
SAM STEEN I guess I'm only uncomfortable that we can move on to some pre-planned activity. 

04:25:15
TYLER Yep. 

04:25:15
SAM STEEN But it won't really be as, I don't know if it's meaningful or it's real or it's... 

04:25:25
JUSTIN Tyler was checking out butts. 

04:25:25
SAM STEEN Thank you. That's what I wanted to hear. 

04:25:30
TYLER It was, it was Tyler number two. It was Tyler number two. 

04:25:35
SAM STEEN It doesn't matter. It was... 

04:25:35
SAM STEEN It was Tyler number two. 

04:25:35
SAM STEEN One of the Tyler's were checking out butts. Is that fair to say? 

04:25:40
JUSTIN And he was like, he was (crosstalk inaudible ) and he was like exhibit A. 

04:25:45
SAM STEEN I think that's fair. 

04:25:45
TYLER And I was reading books. 

04:25:50
TYLER I said the secret's reading books. You take a knee and you read your book like this. 

04:25:55
SHERI BAUMAN Ah. 

04:25:55
SAM STEEN So your real name is Stiffler. 

04:25:55
TYLER Stiffler? Yeah, no, it probably is Stiffler. 

04:26:00
SAM STEEN I was right the first time. So was that so hard or you all didn't know about that? 

04:26:05
JUSTIN He's probably more of a Stiffler type. 

04:26:05
TYLER I am? Okay. 

04:26:10
SAM STEEN How does that feel, to get that out in the air? 

04:26:10
TYLER Just, I don't care. 

04:26:15
JUSTIN And then she started singing and (inaudible ) before we even did this. She was like... 

04:26:20
TYLER And then we took the elevator. 

04:26:20
JUSTIN It wouldn't let us go down. 

04:26:25
TYLER And we made a Christmas tree. 

04:26:25
SHERI BAUMAN Maybe these breaks are not such a great idea, it sounds like. 

04:26:30
SAM STEEN I think they're great. So we have looking at butts, the elevator episode, and (inaudible ). 

04:26:42
JUSTIN She was, okay, she was... 

04:26:42
SAM STEEN Singing. 

04:26:42
JUSTIN Oaky, hold on. 

04:26:42
BRIANNA I was singing George of the Jungle. 

04:26:45
JUSTIN No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. She was, um, by, um, she was singing I like Big Butts and I Cannot Lie and she was saying the beginning part and then it relates to that. 

04:26:50
SAM STEEN I see. So there was a theme that was going on as well. 

04:26:55
TYLER And then, a giant bug flew past my face. 

04:27:00
JUSTIN Oh yeah. 

04:27:00
TYLER It was like, I don't even know what it was. 

04:27:00
BRIANNA Yeah, he screamed like a girl. 

04:27:00
SHERI BAUMAN And now that's an interesting comment. 

04:27:05
SAM STEEN Yeah, screamed like a girl. 

04:27:05
SHERI BAUMAN So. 

04:27:10
SAM STEEN Did he scream like a girl? 

04:27:10
JUSTIN No, literally. 

04:27:10
SHERI BAUMAN But do you know that when people are really scared, their voice does go up like that? So everybody screams at a much higher pitch than they do when they're sort of normal. 

04:27:25
SAM STEEN I didn't know that. 

04:27:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yep. Listen when people are really freaked out. Their, I mean, women's voices go way up too. 

04:27:30
SAM STEEN Oh, were you offended when she, how was it, what was that like to hear him say you scream like a girl? 

04:27:35
TYLER The truth. 

04:27:35
SAM STEEN You own it. 

04:27:40
TYLER I kinda did scream like, well I didn't like scream. 

04:27:40
BRIANNA I thought you did it on purpose. 

04:27:40
TYLER I was like ahh! I, I kinda did do it on purpose. Like, I, I, I was I don't know. It like touched me with its wing. It freaked me out. I was like sitting there and looking at the wall and it was like. It freaked me out. 

04:28:00
SAM STEEN So tell me Alejandra, what are you thinking? 

04:28:00
ALEJANDRA Nothing. 

04:28:00
SAM STEEN You don't think anything? 

04:28:05
ALEJANDRA No. 

04:28:05
TYLER She's upset. 

04:28:05
TAHLIA She thought we didn't include her. 

04:28:05
JUSTIN She's upset. 

04:28:10
TYLER Well, while we were (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:28:12
JUSTIN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:28:13
SAM STEEN Let's, let's let her, if... 

04:28:15
TYLER She was doing her own thing while we were all having our (crosstalk inaudible ). She had like a personal... 

04:28:16
JUSTIN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:28:18
TYLER She was hiding with her mama. 

04:28:20
SHERI BAUMAN Why are you all saying she? She's right here? 

04:28:20
JUSTIN (inaudible ) speak of it. 

04:28:24
TYLER Alejandra had her own personal... 

04:28:25
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) I don't care. 

04:28:25
TYLER Like, like we were messing around. 

04:28:25
ALEJANDRA Tyler called my boyfriend. 

04:28:30
TYLER That one. I did not do that. 

04:28:30
ALEJANDRA And he started talking to him and then... 

04:28:35
SAM STEEN Oh, oh. You called him on the phone. 

04:28:35
TYLER Yeah. 

04:28:35
JUSTIN Tyler number one. 

04:28:35
TYLER Yes. 

04:28:35
ALEJANDRA Tyler number one. (inaudible ). 

04:28:40
TYLER I wanted to talk him. I called him to say hi. 

04:28:40
SAM STEEN Because you were checking him out? 

04:28:40
TYLER No. I don't know. 

04:28:40
JUSTIN No, no, no, no. This Tyler was checking 'em out. 

04:28:45
TYLER No, I was checking it out. 

04:28:45
SAM STEEN The relationship. 

04:28:45
TYLER No. He was. 

04:28:50
TYLER I, I was just calling to say hi. I was like hey, how's it going and I was like... 

04:28:50
SAM STEEN Did that bother you. 

04:28:55
ALEJANDRA No. 

04:28:55
TYLER Yeah. 

04:28:55
ALEJANDRA It has nothing to do with this group. It's just him, you know. 

04:29:00
SAM STEEN Oh, okay. 

04:29:00
TYLER It's a personal. 

04:29:00
JUSTIN She thinks, well, she asked me a question and she's like (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:29:06
SAM STEEN Tell us. We kinda wanna know. You already know so we're the only ones that aren't privy to this, myself and Sheri, is that right? 

04:29:10
TYLER I don't know. 

04:29:10
BRIANNA (crosstalk) I don't know 'cuz I was (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:29:17
TYLER She was singing. 

04:29:17
BRIANNA Yeah, I was in my own little world. 

04:29:17
SAM STEEN So you were (inaudible ). 

04:29:20
TYLER I was reading books. 

04:29:20
SAM STEEN So then, Alejandra, do you wanna share with us what... 

04:29:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I don't wanna make it all about me though. So. 

04:29:25
SAM STEEN But sometimes in groups, don't we sometimes explore? 

04:29:30
JUSTIN Like Tyler with butts and Tyler with his problem. 

04:29:35
ALEJANDRA Well finish what you were gonna say right now (inaudible ). 

04:29:38
JUSTIN Oh, well, okay. All right. So when we came back in, she asked me a question. She was like, you're a boy, right? And I was like obviously. 

04:29:45
SAM STEEN A pretty big one. 

04:29:45
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:29:45
TYLER You'd be a funny looking girl. 

04:29:45
SAM STEEN Good point. 

04:29:50
JUSTIN I'd be a big person. And then so she said how do you tell if your boyfriend's cheating on you and I said to be honest, I really don't know. And I couldn't really answer the question. So. 

04:30:05
SAM STEEN Anybody else wanna weigh in on that that has, not experience actually doing it, but that maybe has enough feedback? 

04:30:15
JUSTIN Well, what, what gave you the idea that he's cheating on you? 

04:30:15
ALEJANDRA I don't know. He's just different. Like, the past couple days been different. Like. 

04:30:20
JUSTIN Like then what? 

04:30:25
TYLER Maybe it's a family problem, maybe. 

04:30:25
SAM STEEN Well let her finish so she can... 

04:30:25
TYLER Oh. 

04:30:25
ALEJANDRA Well, that's exactly what my mom's been saying but, like, I asked him and, I don't know if he's going through puberty or what's his deal, 'cuz, like, he goes to my house and I invite him 'cuz my dad wanted to me, like talk to him 'cuz he knows my dad and he's like oh, I wanna meet your boyfriend so I did. He's like no, I don't wanna go. And then like I'd be telling him come to my house. No, I don't wanna go. It's just, like, weird you know? Like. 

04:30:55
JUSTIN He's distant? 

04:30:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. And then he's like, he told me something. He's like I need some space. Like he, he doesn't like talking to me 24/7. 

04:31:05
JUSTIN Well didn't you guys used to do that all the time? Like you, you said you guys were the three musketeers. You guys used to hang out all the time? 

04:31:15
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:31:15
JUSTIN Maybe you just need to, like, stay a little bit more distant. Not, not completely apart but give him sort of (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:31:27
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Well that's how, that's how I feel. Like yeah, we do have our distance sometimes. (inaudible ). I feel like he doesn't care about me no more 'cuz like, I don't know. He's been so dumb and weird. 

04:31:40
SAM STEEN Earlier, someone was saying, um, I think it was you Bri, that you wouldn't like it if you and that person were together all the time. 

04:31:45
BRIANNA Yeah, I'd probably end up punching someone. 

04:31:50
SAM STEEN Getting kinda frustrated? 

04:31:50
BRIANNA Yeah. Like I can't, even being around my brother or my mom or dad. 

04:31:55
SAM STEEN Anybody? 

04:31:55
BRIANNA Yeah. So when you hear her say that he needs space, you have any sort of reaction to that or any... 

04:32:00
ALEJANDRA To him or? 

04:32:00
SAM STEEN Well either one. I mean, because I know you said that that would get on your nerves. 

04:32:05
BRIANNA Well, it's just maybe, I don't know. Just maybe he needs his him time. 

04:32:10
TYLER Yeah. 

04:32:15
ALEJANDRA I just think he's going through puberty to be honest. I don't know. 

04:32:20
SAM STEEN What you mean? He's what? He's going through puberty, which means what? 

04:32:20
ALEJANDRA Like when guys go through puberty, they act like, uh, meanies. 

04:32:25
JUSTIN (crosstalk) I thought that was girls. Isn't it called like PMS or something? 

04:32:25
ALEJANDRA That's when they're on their period. 

04:32:25
TAHLIA (crosstalk) That's with their period. 

04:32:30
JUSTIN Oh. 

04:32:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah but when guys get, like, when they get on, when they go through puberty, they're just, uh, a meanie. 

04:32:35
SAM STEEN The guys are? 

04:32:35
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

04:32:35
JUSTIN I thought that was the girls. 

04:32:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:32:40
TAHLIA That's bull. 

04:32:40
ALEJANDRA Why do you think it's all about the girls? 

04:32:40
JUSTIN That's what I, that's just my, that's just what I... 

04:32:45
BRIANNA Well, probably some girls (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:32:47
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah, some girls. Some are like... 

04:32:50
JUSTIN 'Cuz I watch Everybody Loves Raymond. Have you see that episode? 

04:32:50
SAM STEEN Not that I know of. 

04:32:55
JUSTIN Anybody watch that show? 

04:32:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. I watch it. 

04:32:55
UNKNOWN What show? 

04:32:55
JUSTIN Everybody loves Raymond. 

04:32:55
TAHLIA Yeah. 

04:32:55
ALEJANDRA Oh my gosh. 

04:32:55
JUSTIN When Deborah (inaudible ) the pills? 

04:33:01
ALEJANDRA Oh yeah. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:33:07
SHERI BAUMAN So let's stay with this question. You know, I think although some of you have had relationships, some of you haven't yet but it's probably on the horizon. One of the things to negotiate is how much time together and how much time apart. That's one thing that couples have to sort of figure out, you know? And I don't think there's a right answer but it's always something that's part of learning to be a couple. What, you know, what does it mean to be a couple? Is it okay to say, you know, I wanna spend Saturday with my family or with my friends. Have a good time doing what you or something else? 

04:33:45
SAM STEEN Has anybody ever been in a situation where someone is with you, spending time, not like boyfriend and girlfriend, and you don't really want them there? Have you ever felt, felt that? Do you know what that feels like? 

04:33:55
TAHLIA Yeah. 

04:33:55
SAM STEEN Does it feel good? 

04:33:55
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Was it a close friend or a sibling maybe? 

04:33:55
SAM STEEN So what happens when that, what do you start doing when they, when they're there and you're really? 

04:34:00
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Ignoring them. 

04:34:05
TAHLIA I ignore them. 

04:34:05
SAM STEEN You ignore them? What else? 

04:34:05
TYLER You start kind of like going off and doing things on your own, not really inviting them. Like, you'll go, like, downstairs and, like, go clean or something and not take them with you. 

04:34:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Right. Exactly. 

04:34:15
TYLER Yeah. 

04:34:15
SAM STEEN What else. You said something Justin. Ignoring them. You maybe just create your own space? 

04:34:20
JUSTIN Well, what I do when people are around me, I usually don't try to hang out with other people. I mean, if you wanna hang out with me, that's cool. You can come hang out with me but I don't try to make the impression or, uh, be someone that I'm not. I just be myself. 

04:34:40
SAM STEEN So if it fits, it fits. If it doesn't, it doesn't. 

04:34:40
JUSTIN Yeah. That's basically how I look at it. 

04:34:45
SAM STEEN So I guess I was asking the question to see that, which is better? For the person to tell you straight up I need some space or them not to tell you and then you're there but they really don't want you there? 

04:34:55
JUSTIN And they keep on being distant. 

04:35:00
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) The first one. 

04:35:00
SAM STEEN Probably the first one, right? 

04:35:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:35:00
TYLER It's like what Justin said about, like, um, staying true to yourself and stuff. Like being, like, yourself. Like just tell her straight up that you want some space. 

04:35:10
SAM STEEN And I remember somebody kept saying keeping it real. 

04:35:15
TYLER Yeah. That's what I was trying to say. 

04:35:15
SAM STEEN I can't remember if it was Justin or it was Alejandra, actually. 

04:35:15
TAHLIA It was Justin. 

04:35:15
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) It was me. 

04:35:20
TYLER I think it was Justin. 

04:35:20
ALEJANDRA Like he didn't do that. Like, I came up with this on my own. I figured it out and by, like, oh, okay dude. You know? That's just what angers me. 

04:35:30
SAM STEEN Well you gave him the words. He was showing you that but you asked? 

04:35:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. But enough of Jesus. 

04:35:40
SAM STEEN One more part of it is how do you equate that to him cheating on you? You know what I mean? You're saying, 'cuz the question you asked Justin is how you know when someone's cheating on you. 

04:35:45
JUSTIN Well, can I? 

04:35:45
SAM STEEN No, no, I'm saying that. 

04:35:50
JUSTIN Oh. 

04:35:50
SAM STEEN The space issue? How is that connected him necessarily cheating on you? 

04:35:50
JUSTIN Maybe he was, she's thinking that the space that he uses is going to be with someone else. 

04:36:00
TYLER Yeah. 

04:36:00
ALEJANDRA (inaudible ). 

04:36:04
JUSTIN And that might not be the problem, the thing. I mean. 

04:36:05
SAM STEEN Is that a yes? 

04:36:05
JUSTIN I mean, if you really like each other and obviously we're young and stuff, so it's gonna be a lot different. Obviously if you like each other, you gotta trust in him that he's not doing anything. Maybe you should ask yourself a couple questions and that, from his point of view or your point of view, on what you really want. 

04:36:30
SAM STEEN Are you asking me or her? 

04:36:30
JUSTIN Her. Sorry. 

04:36:30
SHERI BAUMAN What kinds of questions to ask? 

04:36:30
JUSTIN Um, do I really like him? Like, do I really think that I like him? That's, those are really good questions to ask yourself. I mean, it's different for each person but... 

04:36:45
SAM STEEN Another question might be can you prevent him from cheating on you just by you being with him all the time? You don't have to answer the question. I'm just saying. 

04:36:55
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

04:36:55
SAM STEEN Another would be can you be with him 24 hours? Can you prevent that person from, from wanting to like somebody else? 

04:37:00
ALEJANDRA I don't wanna be mean but I don't wanna talk about this no more. 

04:37:05
SAM STEEN Oh that's no problem. That's not mean. 

04:37:05
SHERI BAUMAN What was it like for everybody else to think about that, whether you're in a relationship or not, to think about these questions or to hear how frustrating it was for Ale to? 

04:37:20
JUSTIN I've only been with my girlfriend for three weeks and so I can't really... 

04:37:25
SAM STEEN Still honeymoon stage. 

04:37:30
SHERI BAUMAN So am I hearing that relationships are pretty new for most of you anyway? 

04:37:35
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. 

04:37:35
SHERI BAUMAN That... 

04:37:35
JUSTIN She's been talk, she's talks, we, uh, don't talk a lot. We more see each other. Like, we'll talk on the phone but we don't text too much and I think that helps 'cuz we talk on the phone. You're not constantly messaging the person. You talk to them fr a while and then you leave it alone and, you know what I mean? 

04:37:55
SAM STEEN So there's some space in there. 

04:37:55
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. I think that's a, helps. 

04:38:00
SAM STEEN Yeah. Maybe that's some quality time when you're on the phone. So for you, like you say, some of the relationships are new. Well, hopefully something was helpful or meaningful to think through and, um, I'm glad you all were willing to admit some of the things that you were sharing that, it obviously was meaningful enough to you to talk about it but don't shy away from sharing it in this case. We can help you think through some of those things. So we can move on to another prompt if you'd like. I don't remember what it was though. 

04:38:35
SHERI BAUMAN I do. It's the quadrant and, um, do you know where your pads are? 

04:38:35
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) They're right here. 

04:38:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ah. Sorry, I'm. 

04:38:40
JUSTIN Thank you. 

04:38:45
SHERI BAUMAN So if we can find these. 

04:38:50
SAM STEEN That's mine. Thank you. 

04:38:50
SHERI BAUMAN And get the markers and crayons. Anybody know where those are? 

04:39:00
TAHLIA That one's mine. 

04:39:05
SAM STEEN Tyler, can you get those (inaudible ). Can you get those markers? 

04:39:15
[sil.] 

04:39:15
SAM STEEN I just need one I think. 

04:39:15
TYLER Okay, I'll share with you. 

04:39:20
JUSTIN Oh my god, these crayons are perfect. 

04:39:20
SHERI BAUMAN I'm sorry? 

04:39:25
JUSTIN These crayons are perfect. 

04:39:25
TYLER (crosstalk (inaudible ). 

04:39:27
ALEJANDRA Do you have any markers? 

04:39:30
BRIANNA Huh? 

04:39:30
ALEJANDRA Can I have a colored pencil? 

04:39:30
BRIANNA We can share. 

04:39:35
SHERI BAUMAN Can I just have something, anything to write with? 

04:39:35
TYLER (inaudible ). 

04:39:38
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So let me, we're gonna, um. 

04:39:40
JUSTIN (inaudible ). Crayons (crosstalk (inaudible[04:39:44). 

04:39:42
SHERI BAUMAN Let me tell you. First thing is if you could divide your paper into, like, four window panes for this. Four squares. 

04:39:50
TYLER (inaudible ). 

04:39:54
SHERI BAUMAN It really doesn't matter. Just so that there's four sides. 

04:39:54
ALEJANDRA I'm sorry. 

04:40:00
SHERI BAUMAN That's okay. They'll be here. 

04:40:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

04:40:03
TYLER (inaudible ). 

04:40:08
SHERI BAUMAN How come? 

04:40:10
TAHLIA 'Cuz it's gonna be (inaudible ). 

04:40:12
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, well it doesn't have to be... 

04:40:12
BRIANNA I can't draw a straight line. 

04:40:15
SHERI BAUMAN I can't do it with a ruler, so. 

04:40:15
JUSTIN How are we, how are we doing it? 

04:40:20
SHERI BAUMAN We're just making four... 

04:40:20
JUSTIN No, how are we doing this session so far? 

04:40:25
SAM STEEN How are we doing? 

04:40:25
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:40:25
SAM STEEN Time wise you mean? 

04:40:25
JUSTIN No, everybody. Together. 

04:40:25
TYLER Like, how are we doing? Like in your opinion. 

04:40:30
SAM STEEN In, I don't understand your question. I'm sorry. 

04:40:30
TYLER Like. 

04:40:30
JUSTIN How's it going? 

04:40:35
TYLER How's the session going so far? 

04:40:35
SAM STEEN How do you think the sessions going? 

04:40:35
JUSTIN We're being ourselves. 

04:40:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:40:40
TYLER Yeah, I know. 

04:40:40
SAM STEEN Is that okay? 

04:40:40
JUSTIN Is this a good thing? 

04:40:45
SAM STEEN I think I've, I've asked that from the very beginning. 

04:40:45
JUSTIN So is this a good thing? 

04:40:45
TYLER I'm being, like, I'm being, like, hyperactive and, like, crazy. 

04:40:50
SAM STEEN You can be hyperactive and crazy. 

04:40:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah, (inaudible ). 

04:40:55
TYLER Yeah. I'm usually. 

04:40:55
SAM STEEN Does that answer your question for you? 

04:40:55
JUSTIN Yeah. So what we're doing, we're... 

04:40:55
SAM STEEN Being yourself. Yeah. That's the only thing I ask. Would you agree with that Sheri? 

04:41:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yes, and there's not a... 

04:41:05
SAM STEEN Right or wrong. 

04:41:05
SHERI BAUMAN Right or wrong way to do it. So that's part of the fun of it, is when you have a different collection of people, there's different chemistry and, you know, different things can happen. So our, are we ready to start into this? 

04:41:15
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

04:41:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, so in this corner, I have to think upside down, like you to, as usual, it's not gonna be for a museum or for anything else, but draw or write or in some way put down a time that you were discriminated against for any reason. Could be your age, it could be your size, it could be your race, it could be your gender. 

04:41:45
SAM STEEN Religion. 

04:41:45
SHERI BAUMAN So think about a time that you were, uh, someone discriminated against you. So I'll just do that for a model. 

04:41:55
BRIANNA Which corner? 

04:41:55
SHERI BAUMAN Um, upper left. And in the right, you're gonna put a time that you, whether purposely or not, discriminated in some way against someone else. Again, on any basis. So just and then up, then down here, a time that you saw, this is going to be interesting trying to write upside down, you observed or witnessed an incident of discrimination when, when you and you intervened, in other words. I can't do this. Okay, excuse me. 

04:42:45
TYLER Wait, this corner's where you discriminated someone? 

04:42:45
SAM STEEN Yes. This one. 

04:42:45
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

04:42:45
TYLER Oh. 

04:42:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

04:42:51
TYLER Have I ever discriminated someone? 

04:42:55
UNKNOWN What if we haven't? 

04:42:55
SHERI BAUMAN Well think real hard. 

04:42:55
SAM STEEN Well just (crosstalk(inaudible ). 

04:43:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

04:43:00
SAM STEEN Think real hard. Even if you didn't do it, maybe you thought about doing it. You know what I mean? 

04:43:00
BRIANNA So, if we're like saying, like, say I didn't let my little brother come (crosstalk inaudible ) 'cuz he's only like 4. 

04:43:06
UNKNOWN (crosstalk (inaudible ). 

04:43:08
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. Do your best to think about it. 

04:43:08
BRIANNA All right, well I'm done. 

04:43:08
TYLER Discrimination 

04:43:15
JUSTIN Tyler. 

04:43:15
SHERI BAUMAN Treating someone, um, in a way based on some characteristic of them rather than who they are. Like... 

04:43:20
UNKNOWN Wait, do we have to draw? 

04:43:20
SHERI BAUMAN You can do it any way that you would like, whether it's words or pictures or symbols. Just so you know what it means. 

04:43:30
JUSTIN Stamps. 

04:43:30
TYLER Discriminating. 

04:43:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

04:43:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) And the last one? 

04:43:30
SHERI BAUMAN It sounds like we need to define discriminate a little better. 

04:43:35
SAM STEEN Well, but what is the last one? You saw. 

04:43:35
SHERI BAUMAN This one here is when, that you observed it and you stepped up. You intervened, which might just be saying I don't like this or whatever and then when you saw or observed and you didn't intervene. So think about those kinds of incidents. 

04:43:55
SAM STEEN So the question was what is discrimination? 

04:44:00
SHERI BAUMAN Mm-hmm. 

04:44:00
SAM STEEN Bri was gonna give an example. Discrimination. 

04:44:05
BRIANNA Like, oh, sorry. Ty, my little brother, I told him he couldn't go with us because he was only 4. He wasn't (inaudible ). 

04:44:12
SHERI BAUMAN So you discriminated based on age? 

04:44:12
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) So you discriminated against how old he was. 

04:44:15
BRIANNA Yes. 

04:44:15
SHERI BAUMAN Or you've commented sometimes that students who have learning disabilities, um, may be targeted for kind of mean teasing based on that. 

04:44:25
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

04:44:25
SHERI BAUMAN Or, um, or so it could be age. It could be disability or academic skills or race or gender or, there's probably a million other categories where that might have happened. 

04:44:40
UNKNOWN What's the bottom right hand corner? 

04:44:45
SHERI BAUMAN So the two bottom ones are one when you saw and you intervened in some way, said something or and here where you saw it but you didn't. 

04:45:00
[sil.] 

04:45:00
JUSTIN (inaudible ). 

04:45:08
BRIANNA That flew out of the sky. 

04:45:08
TYLER That came out of nothing, just like. 

04:45:10
ALEJANDRA Can I borrow the crayons please? 

04:45:20
SHERI BAUMAN These are hard to think of. 

04:45:25
ALEJANDRA I know. 

04:45:25
SHERI BAUMAN Of and about. 

04:45:30
ALEJANDRA How do you do that symbol? The girl and the boy symbols? 

04:45:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, that's a good one. I'm pretty sure that this is the girl and this is boy. 

04:45:40
ALEJANDRA Okay. Thank you. 

04:45:50
[sil.] 

04:45:50
SAM STEEN So maybe not all four of them. Maybe just two of the four? What do you think? Or one of the four? 

04:46:35
SHERI BAUMAN Let's start with each person sharing the one that seems to bring up the most feeling for them. What do you think? (crosstalk (inaudible ). 

04:46:52
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Anybody wanna go first? 

04:46:52
JUSTIN I'll go first. 

04:46:52
BRIANNA Oh, okay. I'll go second. 

04:46:52
SAM STEEN Bri. Well, you always go first. How about Bri go first. Is that okay? 

04:46:55
BRIANNA Okay. 

04:46:55
SAM STEEN Justin, that okay? 

04:46:55
BRIANNA We just do one? 

04:46:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah and tell us which one it is. 

04:47:00
BRIANNA Okay. So, the discrimination, um, and the one that I helped. Uh, a, a mentally challenged kid was walking through the hallway, just minding his own business, being happy and... 

04:47:10
SHERI BAUMAN At your school you mean? 

04:47:10
BRIANNA At my school and a kid tripped him. Like one of the bullies at the school, he tripped him and started laughing at him. And so I went up to the guy and told him that wasn't very nice and some other choice words and he started yelling at me back, so I told him to stop or I'd tell an adult. Yeah. 

04:47:35
SHERI BAUMAN So how did you find the courage to do that? 

04:47:35
BRIANNA Out of anger. 

04:47:40
SHERI BAUMAN And what made you angry was? 

04:47:45
BRIANNA Him tripping the kid for no reason on purpose. 

04:47:50
SHERI BAUMAN So the no reason and, and... 

04:47:50
BRIANNA Yeah. 

04:47:50
SHERI BAUMAN What would you have, um, it sounds like you were busy sort of defending, um, the person. What would you have wanted to say, if you had had a chance, to the person on whom behalf you spoke up? You know, to the kid that was tripped. 

04:48:10
BRIANNA I would have asked him if he was okay but I don't think he liked to talk so, I don't know. 

04:48:15
SHERI BAUMAN So I wonder, were you the only person in the hall or did other kids see that? 

04:48:20
BRIANNA Other kids saw it too. They were just laughing. 

04:48:25
SHERI BAUMAN So and not only did they not have the courage, in some ways they were like encouraging the other kid by laughing and giving him attention, huh? 

04:48:30
BRIANNA Right. 

04:48:35
SHERI BAUMAN What do the rest of you think about Bri being willing to do that? 

04:48:40
TYLER I'm glad 'cuz I feel really bad for the, like, mentally challenged kids 'cuz, I mean, I've, like, I've talked to a lot of them and, like, this one kid, he's like so nice and, like, I feel, and, like, they're, they're so, like, defenseless, you know? And, like, I don't even understand how, like, people could even have, like, the nerve to, like, pick on somebody like that. Like they already have so much to deal with, with, like, being challenged like they are and then you have to go and make it that much harder by picking on them. Like, it's just horrible. 

04:49:15
ALEJANDRA Bri, I think, um, like, I don't feel bad for the mentally challenged. Like, I'm not really (inaudible ), I just think, like, God gave them the, he chose that specific person to be like that for a reason, to do good things, you know? To give the world a change and I'm glad you stepped up 'cuz, like, lots of kids don't deserve that. No one deserves to be bullied, you know? I'm glad you had the courage to step up. 

04:49:50
BRIANNA Thanks. 

04:49:50
ALEJANDRA Welcome. 

04:49:50
SAM STEEN Justin, what were you gonna say? 

04:49:55
JUSTIN About mine? 

04:49:55
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. 

04:49:55
JUSTIN My thing? Um, I went with my friend, his name's Aaron, and, uh. 

04:50:05
SHERI BAUMAN Which one are you gonna share about? 

04:50:05
JUSTIN Oh, um, uh, we got pulled over because of, uh, racial profiling. Um, and I was with my friend and then his brother Andre. It was me. It was Aaron, Andre, my friend Tianta (ph), and I and we were, uh, driving to go to the mall. We were gonna go hang out and go see a movie or something and, um, he had his music up really loud. His brother Andre had his music up really loud and he had a system in his car and, um, it was pretty, it was blaring but it wasn't, like, vibrating the street or anything like that, um, and we got pulled over and the police asked us all to step out of the car. It was four, we're all, we're all black and, um, he asked us all four to step out the car and he said that he's gonna search the car and, um, Andre, um, testified against it because he said, not testified in court but retaliated and said you're not allowed to do that because you don't have a search warrant. You're doing it out of no reason and he said well, once we get the canine unit here, we can do whatever we want and all that and so they came and the dogs were sniffing out the car. They found nothing and then the cop just just like, didn't really say anything, just walked away and so we were there for like an hour, sitting there and, um, he said that he wanted to go to court over it but they wouldn't, he didn't have any motive. 

04:51:30
SAM STEEN You mean your friend didn't have a motive? 

04:51:35
JUSTIN Mm-mm. And he was, we were all upset and, you know. 

04:51:40
SHERI BAUMAN So that was the time when you were a victim of discrimination. 

04:51:45
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:51:45
SAM STEEN What do y'all think? 

04:51:50
BRIANNA I think that cops rude. 

04:51:55
ALEJANDRA Like, I didn't get it. Like, he just pulled you over for no reason, right? 

04:52:00
JUSTIN Yeah, well the music was loud and... 

04:52:05
ALEJANDRA So how do you know it was a racial? Did he, like, tell you guys or did you notice the way he was looking at you? 

04:52:15
JUSTIN Yeah, he, he looked. He pulled us over. I don't know. Just, he was following us for a while. 

04:52:20
ALEJANDRA Uh-huh. 

04:52:20
JUSTIN He was following us and, and Andre was driving as careful as, as possible and had his blinker on every turn, going the speed limit, checking the stop signs and he was following us for a couple blocks and he just turned on his siren. 

04:52:35
SAM STEEN It's an interesting question though. 

04:52:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yes. I was thinking that too. Yeah. 

04:52:40
SAM STEEN 'Cuz on the one hand, you say well, how do you know for a fact that he's been, because of race but regardless, that's how it felt 'cuz there was nothing else. He had no reason for him to search your car. There's no reason for him to pull you over. If he pulled you over and said the music is loud, turn your music down and then drive off. 

04:52:55
JUSTIN Yeah. That's, that's what he could have done. 

04:52:55
SAM STEEN But that's not what happened. 

04:52:55
SHERI BAUMAN You remember that time in New Orleans? 

04:53:00
SAM STEEN What are you talking about in New Orleans? 

04:53:00
SHERI BAUMAN Where it took us an extremely long time to get served and wasn't your mean ultimately like all wrong. 

04:53:10
SAM STEEN I don't even remember. Oh, yes. I remember. Yeah. It was terrible. One time we went out to eat dinner and, um, or lunch I think it was, in New Orleans and I ordered this dish that had to do, it had chicken in it, of course. No offense. I know chicken. 

04:53:25
JUSTIN Yep. 

04:53:25
SAM STEEN I'm a black man. I like a lot of chicken and I know chicken. 

04:53:30
JUSTIN Yep. 

04:53:30
SAM STEEN So the lady brings out the dish, eventually. It was the last one that was served, after everybody else had got served and then it was, um, it's supposed to have ground up chicken in there and I'm digging through the salad and there's not a ounce of chicken, no chicken whatsoever. So I tell her to send it back. She goes back into the back to talk to the cook and he says oh no, there's chicken in there. Well, come to find out, there really was no chicken in there. They didn't compensate me. They just nothing. Just like whatever. Just deal with it. She didn't even make eye contact or talk to me anymore after that. Now, was it due to race? No, not necessarily but I felt very much treated differently. 

04:54:05
JUSTIN You know, you know your soul food. 

04:54:05
SAM STEEN Well yeah, I mean come on. It was chicken. 

04:54:10
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Like, my dad last night. He went, um, are we allowed to say the, the name of the restaurant? 

04:54:15
SAM STEEN Sure. Or just say a restaurant. 

04:54:20
JUSTIN Okay. Well, we went to this restaurant. It's a chicken and waffle place. You know, like those restaurants, chicken and waffle. And, um, my dad ordered catfish with a sweet potato and, um, he got the cat fish and it was all soft and it was, it had breading on, like you know how fried catfish. It had breading on it. 

04:54:40
SAM STEEN Why you asking me? 

04:54:40
JUSTIN (crosstalk) But it, but it was soft. And it was soft and he sent it back and then they were talking about it and he was like well, I know how to cook this type of food. We call this soul food back where I'm from and he, he's going on and on about it. And I just, I just thought that related to... 

04:54:55
SAM STEEN It's related in that he maybe felt like once he sent it back, they should have just fixed it and been done with it. 

04:55:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:55:00
SAM STEEN Or they gave him a hard time. Another one is that I feel like I've been discriminated by, in the store. I mean, I've said this earlier. Me and a couple of my friends, same thing. We were all black kids and just in the store shopping. 

04:55:10
JUSTIN Watching you? 

04:55:10
SAM STEEN Hmm? 

04:55:15
JUSTIN They watch you. 

04:55:15
SAM STEEN Yeah, but I didn't buy anything. But we were just hanging out, you know? And, um, they were following us around and then they finally said well if you're not gonna buy anything, you need to leave. But how many people come into stores all the time browsing and now buying anything? How do you know? I mean, we had money. We just were hanging out and, but that's my, you know. 

04:55:35
SHERI BAUMAN I don't know what that's like for those of us who are not black or real obviously of another race to, you know, to think about that you have to be conscious of, you know what I mean? That we can probably browse in a store as long as we'd like and no one's gonna come up most of the time. Can you kind of imagine what that might be like? 

04:55:55
ALEJANDRA I think it would suck. 

04:56:00
JUSTIN I mean, we saw it happen. Like and, when we got, we got to the mall eventually and that happened. We were walking around the mall waiting for the rest of our group. 

04:56:10
SAM STEEN The same day? 

04:56:10
JUSTIN Yeah. Waiting for the rest of our group to show up and, um, we were waiting to go into the movie and we were walking around and this security guard comes up to us and he's like if you guys aren't gonna buy anything in the mall, you gotta leave. I'm like are you serious? You see all these kids in these groups hanging out and you're gonna kick us out? 

04:56:25
SAM STEEN Twice in the same day? 

04:56:30
JUSTIN Yep. 

04:56:30
SAM STEEN This the same day you got pulled over by the cop? 

04:56:30
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Yep. 

04:56:30
SAM STEEN Wow. 

04:56:30
JUSTIN So we just went and sat in the movie theater lobby and waited for our friends. 

04:56:35
SAM STEEN What do you think Tyler or Tahlia, when you hear that? I mean, it doesn't sound like he's making that up to me. 

04:56:40
TAHLIA What mall was it? 

04:56:45
JUSTIN Um, the Park Place Mall. 

04:56:50
ALEJANDRA What month, what, what day was it? 

04:56:50
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Yeah. Well, our monitor at school, he works there. 

04:56:55
JUSTIN He, he's like really tall. The guy's like really, really tall. 

04:57:00
ALEJANDRA Is he white? 

04:57:00
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:57:00
TAHLIA He has blue eyes? 

04:57:00
ALEJANDRA Does he have a beard? 

04:57:05
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:57:05
ALEJANDRA Are you lying? 

04:57:05
JUSTIN No, I'm not even lying. 

04:57:05
ALEJANDRA Are you sure? 

04:57:05
JUSTIN Yeah. He's kinda dorky looking? 

04:57:10
SAM STEEN What's the point? I mean. 

04:57:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah, he's our monitor and he shouldn't be doing that. Like, he teaches us to be respectful to the other race. 

04:57:15
SAM STEEN Oh (crosstalk(inaudible ). I see. 

04:57:19
ALEJANDRA No, that's, that's not cool. 

04:57:20
SAM STEEN Is that the same guy? 

04:57:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:57:20
TAHLIA Yes, at school. 

04:57:20
JUSTIN He's (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:57:25
ALEJANDRA Does he have like a, a, like a blondish mustache? (inaudible ). 

04:57:28
JUSTIN Yeah. 

04:57:28
ALEJANDRA That's Steve. 

04:57:28
TAHLIA Yeah. 

04:57:28
SAM STEEN But your point is? 

04:57:30
TAHLIA That, that's rude and I can't believe that. 

04:57:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:57:35
SAM STEEN How he's acting even though he's teaching you something else. 

04:57:40
TAHLIA Yeah, (crosstalk inaudible ). 

04:57:41
ALEJANDRA You wouldn't expect that from him. 

04:57:41
BRIANNA Isn't that called a hypocrite or something? 

04:57:41
TAHLIA Yeah. 

04:57:41
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

04:57:41
SAM STEEN Hip what? Oh, hypocrite. Mm-hmm. We have five more minutes. Can you share one more from each of you? 

04:57:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

04:57:50
SAM STEEN 'Cuz we spent a lot of time... 

04:57:50
ALEJANDRA Can I share mine or... 

04:57:50
SHERI BAUMAN Please do. 

04:57:50
ALEJANDRA Okay. Um, okay. So this boy at school, he's like really, really smart. He's like super smart and, like, he, like, he's into the weird stuff, you know? They're not weird, they're just different. Like, World of Warcraft or, just like thinking games and they make fun of him. Like I've seen a teacher do it to him and, like, they just like cut him off when he's trying to say something, like, that's about the class. They just cut him off and, like, I'm like, you're really gonna do that, like, to the teacher. Like I, I confronted him and he, like, just like, he sent me out, you know? And I'm like, that, that's bullying and, like, they took care of it, you know? They talked to the teacher about, like, they told the kids and the teacher, we all have, um, we all have opinions so if you have nothing good to say, don't say it. You know? And like. 

04:58:50
SAM STEEN Does it sound like she stood up for somebody in that case? 

04:58:50
JUSTIN Yep. 

04:58:50
SHERI BAUMAN In a, in a pretty risky 'cuz she didn't just stand up to another kid. She stood up to a teacher. 

04:59:00
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. 

04:59:00
SHERI BAUMAN And that's, and you're putting your own neck out there so good for you. 

04:59:05
ALEJANDRA Thank you. 

04:59:05
SAM STEEN There's three more? 

04:59:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

04:59:10
TYLER I'll share. Um, one time, I, uh, there's, there's like a couple black kids at my school and one of them, his name's Jagnieve (ph). He's not, like, a personal friend of mine but, you know, he's nice and, uh, he was walking around and, like, these kids just walk up and start, like, picking on him and making, like, racist jokes around him and it, this was one of the times I didn't stand up. I, I wanted to but I, I felt, 'cuz they were the type of kids that, like, if you say something or made a wrong move, they'll, like, fight you and there was a big group of 'em. So I just, like, I didn't stand up because I felt that if I did, you know, they outnumbered me. They were way bigger than me. I felt that if I did do something, that I would, you know, I'd get beat up or I'd have to fight them. You know, I don't wanna get in a fight but I didn't want to have to get in that situation. So. 

05:00:05
SHERI BAUMAN So I think it took an awful lot of courage to, to be able to say I wish I could have but I really didn't. 

05:00:10
TYLER Yeah. 

05:00:10
SAM STEEN Yeah. I commend you for even admitting that because some people wouldn't tell a story like that and it sounds like in that case, if you could go back and do it differently, you might do it differently? 

05:00:20
TYLER Yeah. 

05:00:20
SAM STEEN Any, any, any sort of feelings you have about what you just heard Tyler say? 

05:00:25
ALEJANDRA I mean, I understand, you know? Like, at least, do you, like, do you regret it? 

05:00:35
TYLER Yeah. 

05:00:35
ALEJANDRA So at least you regret it. If you, like, were selfish and you didn't really care, you wouldn't bring this up. 

05:00:40
SAM STEEN If he has to do that, if he's confronted by that again, I, I suspect it's gonna come up again, Tyler, what do you think he can do? 

05:00:50
TYLER He can think about what he wants to do. Does he wanna help himself or does he wanna help the other person in the situation? 

05:01:00
ALEJANDRA If that situation were to happen again, I would just go up to the guy that's being bullied or the girl and I'd just tell, like, walk away with him. 

05:01:05
SHERI BAUMAN That's a, a really good alternative. You don't have to confront someone who's likely to, to smash your face in, especially if there's a bunch of them, but you can reach out to the person who's being mistreated and say come on, let's go. 

05:01:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:01:20
SHERI BAUMAN So that's an alternative way to manage that. 'Cuz you know what? It is pretty scary if there's a bunch of people that are looking pretty rough to think about befriending him. 

05:01:30
JUSTIN That's weird because sometimes, I get, people look at me. Like, when I stand up for people, people get intimidated and, I mean, if you're doing it for the right cause, it's a good thing. 

05:01:45
SAM STEEN Sometimes when you stand up for things, though, it is dangerous. It's risky. You know, so you have to find your allies. Maybe ask for help. Maybe go get help right away versus trying to stand up for them. 

05:02:00
SHERI BAUMAN That (crosstalk inaudible ) reaching out to the person who's the target and letting them know that they do have a friend and you can say, I wish I could have jumped in but I don't think they would have treated me any better than they did you. Sorry you experienced that. Who didn't we hear from? 

05:02:15
TAHLIA Me and Tyler. 

05:02:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Okay. Which one are you gonna share? 

05:02:20
TAHLIA Um, that I didn't want my brother to go to to the movies with me and my friends because he was younger and I think he's annoying. 

05:02:35
SHERI BAUMAN So you discriminated against him, huh? 

05:02:35
TAHLIA Yeah, but he still went. 

05:02:40
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. So you did and it didn't happen anyway. 

05:02:40
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:02:45
JUSTIN How old is he? 

05:02:45
TAHLIA He's younger. 

05:02:45
ALEJANDRA He's in 7th grade. 

05:02:50
TAHLIA Yeah. Seventh. 

05:02:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah, he's in 7th grade. One year apart. 

05:02:50
SHERI BAUMAN So gender and age and his behaviors. 

05:02:55
TAHLIA Mm-hmm. 

05:02:55
SAM STEEN Did it come out okay? Or was it a problem? Him being there? 

05:03:00
TAHLIA Um, I don't know. 

05:03:05
SAM STEEN You don't know? 

05:03:05
TAHLIA I just didn't talk. 

05:03:05
SAM STEEN You just didn't talk to him? 

05:03:05
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I think it was a problem for her but not for everyone else, you know? 

05:03:10
SAM STEEN They, they were cool with it? 

05:03:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:03:10
JUSTIN Were you there? 

05:03:15
ALEJANDRA Yeah. It was me, my boyfriend, and her, his brother, Eddie was there? 

05:03:20
TAHLIA (crosstalk) Eddie. I think so. 

05:03:20
ALEJANDRA I don't know, I don't remember. 

05:03:25
SAM STEEN But the point is it was more of a problem for you maybe than anybody else. 

05:03:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:03:25
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:03:25
SHERI BAUMAN Let's, in the interest of time, let's hear from Tyler. Which one are you gonna share with us? 

05:03:35
TYLER Well, I was discriminated from, from soccer tryouts 'cuz I like, I, soccer's pretty (inaudible ) but kids discriminate me because I was white and they're Mexican and they said white people can't make the team but I proved them wrong when I made the team. 

05:03:50
SHERI BAUMAN Did they use the word white people or did they use offensive terms for them? 

05:03:55
TYLER They called me, like, cracker and stuff like that, but... 

05:03:55
JUSTIN That's messed up. 

05:04:00
TYLER I just deal with it. 

05:04:00
SHERI BAUMAN It, how, how do you deal with it? Some people wouldn't... 

05:04:00
TYLER Just take it. 

05:04:05
SHERI BAUMAN So you don't... 

05:04:05
JUSTIN I hate racist comments. 

05:04:05
SHERI BAUMAN You don't speak back. You just ignore it? 

05:04:10
TYLER No, I, I pretty much just take it. Just (inaudible ). 

05:04:14
SAM STEEN That's amazing that you can just take it like that and that you still tried out. You didn't get offended. Did you talk to anybody about it? 

05:04:20
TYLER No, not really 'cuz I also had another friend. Like it was just two kids, we were the only two kids that... 

05:04:25
SAM STEEN Two white kids? 

05:04:25
TYLER On the team and so we just really hung out together. 

05:04:30
SAM STEEN So that was your support network, the other guy? 

05:04:30
TYLER Yeah. It turns out it was, he was one of my best friends too, so that was good. 

05:04:35
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) That helps. 

05:04:35
ALEJANDRA Can, can I say something to that? 

05:04:35
SAM STEEN (inaudible ). 

05:04:38
ALEJANDRA Okay. Um, I just remembered in 5th grade, I guess I look white. I don't know if you guys agree. They, like, always ask me, you're white, but I'm Hispanic, you know? So this girl, she's Yauci and she just would call me mean names and, like, I would get mad and, like, she wanted to fight me but I told my parents about it and they didn't, like, let me go to school and, like, I discriminate right back by asking her something that I shouldn't ask, you know? And yeah. 

05:05:15
SAM STEEN How's it related to Tyler's comment? 

05:05:15
ALEJANDRA 'Cuz they think I'm white and they called me names like that. 

05:05:20
SAM STEEN Ah, I see. 

05:05:20
SHERI BAUMAN You know what's interesting about that, among other things. Sometimes it doesn't matter what we are, it's what people think we are. You know? So in your case, if you're not white but they treat you that way, it still hurts to hear the names. 

05:05:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN Or if someone isn't gay but people think they are and say huh? 

05:05:40
JUSTIN That happens a lot at my school. 

05:05:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. Um, so it, it isn't always based on the truth. It's based on someone's idea of what it might be. 

05:05:50
SAM STEEN It also maybe who the majority is. You mentioned that there's a lot, in Tyler's case, there's a lot more Mexican's so the whites are considered the minority. 

05:06:00
SHERI BAUMAN So we need to stop and I just wanna end and say that I think, um, the kinds of things you shared took some courage and some trust in the group that you can talk openly about things. 

05:06:10
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

05:06:10
SHERI BAUMAN And I think it takes a lot of courage to be willing to say what you did, Tyler. SO that particularly touched me. Thanks for that. 

05:06:20
SAM STEEN And we have two more sessions left, so we'll see you in, in a week. 

05:06:25
End of Session 6 

05:06:30
[sil.] 

05:06:30
Session 6 Processing 

05:06:40
[music] 

05:06:40
SHERI BAUMAN So, I love that you can tolerate the, the silly kid stuff sort of so much better than I and I'm amazed, frankly, that they came back 'round. 

05:06:55
SAM STEEN Were you worried? 

05:06:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. I thought we were gonna giggle the whole time and, and it's always interesting to me how the very first day, they barely acknowledged each other and spoke and now they're best pals and have, right, and, and secrets. Right. 

05:07:10
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah, side comments and the stories going on. Yeah. Yeah, I don't, I don't know. I do have a high tolerance for normally giggling, but you know, my first job was with elementary school kids so when I work with older kids, I tend to treat them the same way. Like, they're just little kids. They try to act a little bit more mature. 

05:07:30
SHERI BAUMAN But anyway, I was, I was relieved that we got back. 

05:07:35
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

05:07:35
SHERI BAUMAN To a focus. 

05:07:35
SAM STEEN Well we finally did and, and it's amazing. Once they shared whatever the elephant in the room was for that moment, they literally calmed down and it was like, that was it. Then it was like oh, it's not a big deal. Remember Tyler was like oh, it's not a big deal. I, honestly I thought he was talking about masturbation. 

05:07:50
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, what gave, what? 

05:07:50
SAM STEEN It was, they were talking about palms, hands, and you know. 

05:07:55
SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

05:07:55
SAM STEEN And it's very inappropriate and I thought well, that's slightly inappropriate but let's go there and see what happens but it wasn't. You know? So but it had to do with sexuality. Something, big butts or something like that. You know, which is funny. 

05:08:05
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you know, it's pretty warm here so the young ladies tend to dress in rather, um, minimal shorts and that sort of thing so they might, and they're, I don't know how many sororities are just across the, so they may have had an eyeful and it sounds like he had developed a strategy. 

05:08:25
SAM STEEN But they did come back and then, so what'd you think about after they got back? You know, as far as, like, the content or sort of the process? What do you think? 

05:08:35
SHERI BAUMAN I, I was trying to, and I think they got as much as they could, that, for example, when a black kid talks about being stopped, that it's a different experience than a white person, particularly here where there aren't a lot of blacks, you know, doing the very same thing. You know, there's always that question and I'm not sure they got it but I think they're awareness was raised and at least, um, they were heard. 

05:09:05
SAM STEEN For the ones who experienced it. 

05:09:10
SHERI BAUMAN Right. And of course to me, the most, I, I thought Tyler acknowledging that he didn't stand up. 

05:09:15
SAM STEEN Oh, for sure. 

05:09:15
SHERI BAUMAN Was taking a, a very different kind of risk and that was good modeling. 

05:09:20
SAM STEEN Yeah. Definitely the boldness of him to admit that or his courage. I think we used the word too. 

05:09:25
SHERI BAUMAN But what I'm wondering where to go. We had talked about sort of backing off a little and doing more closure things but I'm wondering if we should, you know. 

05:09:35
SAM STEEN Well there's two sessions left. So we have... 

05:09:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right, but we had, uh, the, the circles of identity. 

05:09:45
SAM STEEN Mm-hmm. Or. 

05:09:45
SHERI BAUMAN Or the puzzle or the gifts or all of those or, you know, we. 

05:09:50
SAM STEEN Yeah. I don't really know. I mean, we run the risk again of, that, that activity was simple enough that they could just jot down a few things and then describe it. If we focus on that earlier in the session, maybe the conversation would have centered around that but we didn't. We focused on what they wanted to talk about and whether or not we feel that it's meaningful, it obviously was important enough for them to bring it up, you know? 

05:10:15
SHERI BAUMAN Maybe we take a piece of that 'cuz part of it was, you know, rather than do the drawings and the whole thing, um, what if we ask them what, you know, aspects of their identity do they, you know, do they think is most essential to their identity, whether it's gender or race or age or, um, ability or disability, whatever and then, so not all the diagrams and whatever and then just to think about what sort of stereotype of that group that maybe, uh, some people believe and, or, and how would you correct that. How would you restate that? 

05:11:00
SAM STEEN So look at modifying the activity on multiple identity, on multiple perspectives of their identity? 

05:11:10
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Yeah. And have the puzzle available if that goes shorter. And if not, we can can that or think about whether they're able to do the gifts, whether they know each other well enough and whether they're, (crosstalk (inaudible ). 

05:11:25
SAM STEEN Well let's just stick with the next session would be modifying that multiple identities one? 

05:11:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. What do you think? 

05:11:30
SAM STEEN I don't see it as being a problem. Um, again, we should open up with what do you want to talk about in the event that there's something else that they want to explore. 

05:11:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. Or more like is there something on your mind that you'd like to share with the group? And then. 

05:11:45
SAM STEEN Oh, tell me about, uh, Alejandra, you know, how we allowed her to think through this boy situation and then she said I'm done. I'm done. I don't wanna deal with that. How do you think we handled that? 

05:12:00
SHERI BAUMAN I think we were respectful of her. 

05:12:00
SAM STEEN It didn't cause her to, to tone, to tune out. She kept going there. I mean, later on she participated. 

05:12:10
SHERI BAUMAN I think maybe, and I might even agree, you know, everything was said that could be said at that point. 

05:12:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) About the situation? 

05:12:15
SHERI BAUMAN I mean, she acknowledged she's very inexperienced at relationships. You know, she doesn't really know. She wonders but what else was there to say and she had felt like she had taken air time. I thought we did okay. I think it's important to respect their... 

05:12:30
SAM STEEN For sure. I agree. I was, yeah, I'm glad she didn't, like, just tune out. Like, you know, become overly sensitive or, you know, you open up this can of worms. 

05:12:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

05:12:40
SAM STEEN And now she's done for the rest of the day, but she wasn't. 

05:12:45
SHERI BAUMAN So you do you wanna facilitate that activity since I facilitated this one or do you wanna do the same thing we did? 

05:12:50
SAM STEEN Um, maybe we do the same thing because you're more familiar with it. 

05:12:50
SHERI BAUMAN So do you wanna do a check in and? 

05:12:50
SAM STEEN Yep. Yeah, I'll do the check in and then we'll go. 

05:12:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

05:12:55
SAM STEEN How about that? 

05:12:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Except if they get sort of, you know, if they've, I don't know, if they wanna talk about music or something that we get them into the focus. You know, just, how about we do, um, one to 10 on how comfortable they are in the group or how, no, let's do safe 'cuz they've talked about trust. 

05:13:15
SAM STEEN Well, I'm, I'm not following you. Say that again. 

05:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

05:13:15
SAM STEEN Rather than this do this? This is what I don't understand. 

05:13:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. I'm wondering if, you know, certainly if there's something pressing that they wanna take group time for but as a quick check in and to kinda get 'em focused, how safe do you feel in this group? Um, one is you don't feel safe at all and 10 is I feel completely safe and then we can move into the activity 'cuz they've just acknowledged, maybe, that they feel safe enough. 

05:13:45
SAM STEEN The activity that you're gonna do? 

05:13:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. The modified, so we're gonna, instead of doing all the circles, just think about the various aspects of your identity like gender, race, age. 

05:13:55
SAM STEEN No, I got that part. 

05:13:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

05:13:55
SAM STEEN I was asking about the opening. 

05:14:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. So would it be okay to do the one to 10 on trust or safety? 

05:14:05
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) As opposed to what? That's what I don't understand. 

05:14:05
SHERI BAUMAN I don't know that we had one, so I'm saying could we... 

05:14:05
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Oh, you're just giving one. 

05:14:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, saying that that might sort of get us in the right place. 

05:14:10
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Okay, I understand. Sure, absolutely. As, you're saying, I think this is what you're saying. Opposed to having it open, so like what do you wanna talk about, you're saying say on a one, on a scale of one to 10. 

05:14:20
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

05:14:20
SAM STEEN And then move into the activity that you're doing. And you say that because? 

05:14:25
SHERI BAUMAN Because I think we got some good momentum going towards the end of the last session but we ran out of time and, and part of the reason we ran out of time was yes, there was an elephant in the room. We had to untangle it. Um, or acknowledge it. 

05:14:40
SAM STEEN Whatever. Uh-huh. 

05:14:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. And I would hope that we wouldn't run out of time for another activity for very similar reasons. 

05:14:50
SAM STEEN I see. 

05:14:50
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think? Is that okay? 

05:14:50
SAM STEEN It's fine. Yeah, it's fine. 

05:14:50
SHERI BAUMAN There's so much, as we talked about, you're much more comfortable when that happens but... 

05:15:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah, exactly. Yeah, let's just try it and see what happens. 

05:15:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. And then we can decide about the last session with them. 

05:15:05
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Absolutely. 

05:15:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

05:15:05
SAM STEEN Okay. 

05:15:05
End of Session 6 Processing 

05:15:10
[sil.] 

05:15:10
Session 7 

05:15:20
[music] 

05:15:20
SAM STEEN So I would say welcome back everyone. First comment I heard was Tyler saying to Justin that he reminds him of his uncle. 

05:15:25
TYLER Yeah. 

05:15:25
SAM STEEN Is he black? 

05:15:30
TYLER No, he's not black. 

05:15:30
SAM STEEN Is he big? 

05:15:30
TYLER Yeah. He's, he's big like... 

05:15:35
SAM STEEN Huge? 

05:15:35
TYLER Like he's not as like as, like, 'cuz Justin's more like big and strong. He's kinda just big and chubby but they're both big. 

05:15:40
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Big and chubby. Is that what is that reminds you of him? 

05:15:40
TYLER Yeah, kinda. And like his attitude is kinda like mellow and kinda like, just like chill. That's... 

05:15:50
SAM STEEN That seems like a compliment. 

05:15:50
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Does he go with the flow? 

05:15:50
JUSTIN Thank you. Thank you. 

05:15:50
TYLER You're welcome. That's what reminds me of (inaudible ). 

05:15:56
UNKNOWN Gangster. 

05:15:56
TYLER So yeah. 

05:15:56
SAM STEEN As we get started, you know, um, thanks for sharing that Tyler. I thought it was interesting to hear you say it. We have two sessions left. On a scale, I'd like you to reflect very briefly, on a scale of one to 10, one being not necessarily and 10 being extremely, um, how safe do you feel like, um, you are in sharing your feelings in this group? A scale of one to 10. So we'll just go around and... 

05:16:20
ALEJANDRA What do we put our fingers up? 

05:16:25
SAM STEEN No, just tell us. Uh, what about you Pork Chop, um, Brianna? 

05:16:25
BRIANNA Um, 10. This many. 

05:16:30
SAM STEEN You feel extremely safe? Tyler, you? 

05:16:35
TYLER Ten. 

05:16:35
SAM STEEN Really, a 10? 

05:16:35
TYLER A 9.9. 

05:16:40
SAM STEEN Nine point nine? What about you Tahlia? 

05:16:45
TAHLIA Um, 10. 

05:16:45
SAM STEEN Ten? 

05:16:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, 10. 

05:16:50
SAM STEEN Earlier you had a different number. 

05:16:50
ALEJANDRA Oh, I was counting. 

05:16:55
SAM STEEN Oh, were you counting? And you? 

05:16:55
JUSTIN Ten point zero, zero. 

05:16:55
SAM STEEN So did everybody say 10 except for you? 

05:17:00
TYLER I said 9.9. 

05:17:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah, 9.9 too. 

05:17:00
SAM STEEN Nine point nine? 

05:17:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:17:00
SAM STEEN What would make it go from a 9.9 to a 10? 

05:17:05
ALEJANDRA What? 

05:17:05
SAM STEEN What would help, what could we do here to make it perfectly safe? 

05:17:10
ALEJANDRA Nothing. Well, I get it. Um, in my opinion, nothing. 

05:17:15
SAM STEEN So nothing can cause it to move up? What about your? 

05:17:20
ALEJANDRA Probably. 

05:17:20
TYLER Um, I don't really know. I just feel that, like, I don't know. Like nothing is, I don't know. 

05:17:30
SAM STEEN Nothing is perfect. 

05:17:30
TYLER Nothing is perfect. Yeah. 

05:17:35
SAM STEEN Got it. 

05:17:35
TYLER Let's just put it that way. 

05:17:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:17:35
TYLER Like, it'll never be perfect but then if I think about, like, okay what would be perfect. Like, just, I don't know. Like, like talking to myself, I guess. 

05:17:45
SAM STEEN Yeah, I see what you mean. 

05:17:45
TYLER 'Cuz I can talk to myself, like, and that's perfect. 

05:17:50
SAM STEEN So overall, generally speaking, it's pretty safe. 

05:17:50
TYLER (crosstalk) Yeah, no, I feel. Yeah, completely safe. 

05:17:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:17:55
TYLER But, like, I mean, but, I don't know. 

05:17:55
SAM STEEN Was there any point and time where you felt unsafe? 

05:18:00
TYLER Nope. 

05:18:00
TYLER The very beginning. 

05:18:00
SAM STEEN The very beginning? 

05:18:00
SHERI BAUMAN The very beginning. 

05:18:00
TYLER Yeah, I guess so. 

05:18:05
SAM STEEN Like the first session, first (inaudible ). What about you Bri? At any point and time where you felt unsafe? 

05:18:10
BRIANNA Probably the beginning. I was more nervous. 

05:18:15
SAM STEEN You were nervous. Tahlia? 

05:18:15
TAHLIA No. 

05:18:15
SAM STEEN You were always comfortable? 

05:18:20
SAM STEEN I'm surprised to hear you say that. I thought you were uncomfortable early on. 

05:18:25
TAHLIA No. 

05:18:25
JUSTIN You're just quiet, huh? 

05:18:30
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:18:30
JUSTIN You just quiet? 

05:18:30
TAHLIA What? 

05:18:30
JUSTIN You're just quiet? 

05:18:35
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:18:35
SHERI BAUMAN Is that how you would describe yourself in general? As a, as someone who's quiet? 

05:18:40
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:18:40
SHERI BAUMAN So it's not just in this group, that's kind of a characteristic? I don't know about anybody else, one of the things I've noticed is that when you do say something, it's usually, like, valuable. That you don't just speak to hear your voice, but you speak because you have something to say. Do you know what I mean? 

05:19:00
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:19:00
JUSTIN Heartfelt. 

05:19:00
SAM STEEN It's very heartfelt and thoughtful for sure. Do y'all agree with that? 

05:19:05
TYLER Yeah. 

05:19:05
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

05:19:05
SHERI BAUMAN Good words. Well, we had talked about, first of all, we only have two sessions left and I, and, and I've been thinking about the differences just in the atmosphere even before and after group when you arrived from session one, when you all were sitting very quietly and not sure with each other and now, uh, that's all gone and you're friends and you play and you fool around and tease each other. So a lot of things have changed, um, and it, we're also gonna be saying goodbye, so we wanna be mindful of that and think about what this experience has meant. But to, to kind of follow on what we were talking about last session, we're gonna not use our, um, notebooks for this if we can keep it in our heads, partly for time and when we think about who we are, you know, we can, part of our identity includes things like gender, whether you're male or female, or race, or religion, or abilities and disabilities, or, um, maybe personality characteristics or the kind of family we come from. All those things make up how we see ourselves. Does that make sense so far? 

05:20:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:20:25
SHERI BAUMAN So I'd like you to think about, um, what you think is the top one or maybe two of those kind of things that are, like, most important in how you see yourself. So it might be, in my case let's say, it might be, um, gender and age and then when, when we share, we're gonna talk about both those and what are some, like, stereotypes people have of that group. Like, women are this and what we would really like people to, you know, what's the truth of that. So the first part of the thinking piece is what are the, the parts of yourself that are most important in your picture of who you are. Did that make sense? 

05:21:20
ALEJANDRA Kind of. Not really. 

05:21:25
SHERI BAUMAN Kind of. 

05:21:25
SAM STEEN Does anybody understand what she means so far? 

05:21:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Sam... 

05:21:30
SAM STEEN No, wait. I'm just saying. Anybody? You said kind of. You wanna try to explain it to Alejandra? 

05:21:35
TYLER Me? 

05:21:35
SAM STEEN Yes. 

05:21:40
TYLER Like, what do you mean? 

05:21:40
SAM STEEN What Sheri just said. The parts that she just said. Sheri wanted us to think about some parts of our identities and she gave examples. Can you explain that? 

05:21:50
TYLER Like, your family? Like, like your identity is your... I don't know. 

05:21:55
SAM STEEN So you're not sure. 

05:21:55
TYLER Yeah. 

05:21:55
SAM STEEN It's okay if you're not. 

05:21:55
ALEJANDRA So like your personality or your traits? 

05:22:00
SAM STEEN No, not necessarily traits. They're like categories that society would see you as, right? Parts of your identity. So you can be male, female, race is another one. So gender's one. Race is one. Religion's one. 

05:22:15
TYLER Age. 

05:22:15
SAM STEEN Age. Right? Sexuality's another one. So then think of a few about you... 

05:22:25
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Disabilities is another one. 

05:22:25
SAM STEEN That are important to you. So maybe gender is important to you and, like Sheri said, and age. That's just the first step. Does that makes sense now? 

05:22:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I get it now. 

05:22:35
SAM STEEN So think about that in your head. Pick out one or two that are like the center. If were drawing a picture, this is a picture of yourself, in the middle, what's the most important to you? Age, gender, race, etc. You got that? 

05:22:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Do we say it out loud? 

05:22:50
SAM STEEN You don't say it out loud yet but just make sure you have it in your head. 

05:22:55
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

05:22:55
SAM STEEN Can you keep track? You got it? 

05:22:55
TYLER That's like important? Like... 

05:23:00
SAM STEEN The most important. 

05:23:00
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) In how you think of yourself and how you present yourself to the world. 

05:23:00
TYLER (crosstalk) Oh. 

05:23:00
SAM STEEN 'Cuz they're all important, right? They're all a piece of who you are, but within the context of how you present yourself to others, right? 

05:23:10
TYLER Oh, yeah. 

05:23:10
SAM STEEN Justin, you got it? 

05:23:15
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. 

05:23:15
SAM STEEN You Brianna? You, I didn't see you nod your head, that's all. 

05:23:15
SHERI BAUMAN So if you have it, thumbs up so we know. Okay. So, um, what I'd like people to do is, um, share one or two and some stereotypes of that that you've been aware of and how you, you'd like to correct that. For example, okay? So I'll start with let's say being a female and that is important to how I see myself and I would say that one stereotype that people have of women is that they're kind of lightweights and I don't mean by, by weight, I mean that they're not very tough. They're not very strong. They can't, can't take on very challenging kinds of things and I would like the world to know that the women can do anything that they set their minds to do and then some. 

05:24:20
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

05:24:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

05:24:25
ALEJANDRA Tyler wants to go first. 

05:24:25
TYLER This one? 

05:24:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah, he raised his hand. 

05:24:25
TYLER I'd say, like, being a male. The stereotype is that they said males don't have feelings. We have feelings but, might not be as deep as girls but, you know. 

05:24:35
JUSTIN We're not allowed to show 'em as much. 

05:24:40
TYLER Yeah. 

05:24:40
ALEJANDRA What? What did you say? 

05:24:40
JUSTIN (crosstalk (inaudible ). 

05:24:44
TYLER And when we argue, we don't, like, or even when we get in, like, fights and stuff, we don't fight each other with words to hurt each other's feelings. It's like not, yeah. 

05:24:55
JUSTIN (inaudible ). 

05:24:56
TYLER Yeah. 

05:24:56
JUSTIN More, it's more like, um, rough housing type thing. 

05:25:00
SHERI BAUMAN So is it boys don't have the feelings and, what, no. I'm, erase that. You said that they have them. They don't just show them in the same way right? 

05:25:15
TYLER Yeah. 

05:25:15
SHERI BAUMAN Do they, um, where do boys come... 

05:25:15
SAM STEEN Hold on. Yeah. 

05:25:15
SHERI BAUMAN I'm sorry. 

05:25:20
TAHLIA That they don't have the courage to show them? 

05:25:20
SHERI BAUMAN And I was gonna ask, where did they get, where do boys get that message that you're not supposed to show? How, how is it that boys have decided it, since you, you have feelings. 

05:25:30
JUSTIN Society. 

05:25:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Like, they'll make fun of them if they, like, touch you with like, something like, I'm pretty sure if they told Justin your friends or like if you were going out with your girlfriend already for like three months and you're like oh, I think I love her. Like, I'm pretty sure his friends would be like oh, you're getting soft. Like, you know? Like, they'll just, you know what I'm saying? 

05:25:55
JUSTIN Yeah, I understand. 

05:25:55
ALEJANDRA Like that. So that's why guys don't come out, like, and say feelings as much as girls. 

05:26:00
SHERI BAUMAN so the society has given them the message that don't and if you do, you're having to have a lot of courage 'cuz you're going against these expectations. 

05:26:15
JUSTIN Form, kind, I'd say it's a form of discrimination, um, my age. I'm 13, getting ready to turn 14 and my girlfriend she's 14 but she's a freshman in high school. So there's a, people make fun of us. They make fun of her more so. But, and then like she's going out with a younger person but technically we're gonna be the same age for a little bit. Whatever. 

05:26:45
ALEJANDRA Wow. 

05:26:45
SAM STEEN Were you surprised about that? 

05:26:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah. I think it's cute. 

05:26:50
SHERI BAUMAN So what would you say is the, which of those groups is the most important in who you are? 

05:26:55
JUSTIN Um, age. 

05:26:55
SHERI BAUMAN So being a 13 year old is a big part of how you see yourself? 

05:27:00
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. 

05:27:00
SAM STEEN Because of this relationship or just period? 

05:27:00
JUSTIN Because of the relationship and most, I'm a November person, so I'm usually the youngest, so that also affects the. 

05:27:10
SHERI BAUMAN You mean you're younger than your classmates?Maybe because of the way they do birthdates? 

05:27:15
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. And plus I'm so big, so people always think I'm, like, a freshman or a sophomore. 

05:27:25
SHERI BAUMAN Does that work against you or for you? 

05:27:25
JUSTIN Um, sometimes it works against me and sometimes it works for me. 

05:27:30
SHERI BAUMAN Give me an example. 

05:27:30
JUSTIN Um, playing football works for me 'cuz people want me to be on their team. They see me as a more mature person, a leader on the football team because of my size and then because of my size, people also don't want me, I'm the, I'm actually very great with little kids. Some people don't want me around their kids because I might be too rough with them. I'm actually very gentle with little kids 'cuz I have a little sister so I know how to handle little kids. 

05:28:00
SHERI BAUMAN So something you would like people to know about people who are big for their age is... 

05:28:10
JUSTIN We don't, some, most of the time we don't appear. I mean, we don't, we aren't really the way we appear sometimes. 

05:28:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:28:15
SAM STEEN You agree with that? 

05:28:20
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

05:28:20
SAM STEEN You keep commenting, laughing and snickering. 

05:28:20
ALEJANDRA No, I wasn't laughing. I have something in my eye. 

05:28:25
SAM STEEN Oh, okay. 

05:28:25
JUSTIN Have Tahlia blow in it again. 

05:28:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I wasn't gonna say that right now, but I think that's cute that you like to be around kids. That's, like, the first guy I've heard said that. 

05:28:40
JUSTIN Yeah, (inaudible ). 

05:28:44
ALEJANDRA Especially at your age, you know? 

05:28:45
SHERI BAUMAN So someone else, what do you think is your most defining, the most important characteristic? 

05:28:50
BRIANNA Uh, my most important characteristic is that I'm a female because even though being a female, the only female in Junior League Baseball, all the guys think that I can't do it. That I'm not better than them. Like, I can't hit the ball because I'm a girl. So, whenever I hit a really good hit, like a couple weeks ago, I hit a homerun, like over the fence and they just, they didn't care 'cuz they just thought that it was luck. 

05:29:20
SHERI BAUMAN So even when you show them. 

05:29:25
BRIANNA Yeah. 

05:29:25
SHERI BAUMAN That I can do what you can do, they find a way to say oh, it wasn't 'cuz you're... 

05:29:30
BRIANNA So I'm waiting for the time I do it again, so I can show them that girls are just as good as boys. 

05:29:35
SHERI BAUMAN So that's your message. Girls are just as good. Cool. Got that, you guys? 

05:29:40
JUSTIN That's interesting though. I mean... 

05:29:45
SAM STEEN Tell her. 

05:29:45
JUSTIN It's interesting because soft, they softball and they have baseball. The, their pitching speeds are a lot slower. SO what do you think of that? 

05:30:00
BRIANNA I, uh, most of the guys in the league pitch like 75 to, to 80 but in softball, I pitch 70, which is kind of different but, well, I'm the fastest on my team, so. 

05:30:15
SHERI BAUMAN So you're showing them. 

05:30:20
JUSTIN Yeah. You're making a statement. 

05:30:20
SAM STEEN Does that motivate you, that they say you can't do it? So you wanna prove them wrong? 

05:30:30
BRIANNA Yeah. 

05:30:30
SHERI BAUMAN That's so interesting 'cuz, you know, some people when someone says oh, you can't do that, they say oh, you're right and give up and others say watch this. 

05:30:40
SAM STEEN Tyler had an example of that earlier. 

05:30:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

05:30:40
SAM STEEN I think Justin did too. 

05:30:45
SHERI BAUMAN So, one for the females, right? Good for you. 

05:30:50
SAM STEEN How do other women in the room, can I call you women or girls? 

05:30:50
ALEJANDRA Girls. 

05:30:50
SAM STEEN 'Cuz I've got girls. How do the other girls in the room feel when they hear Brianna say that? 

05:30:55
TAHLIA Proud. 

05:31:00
SAM STEEN It makes you proud? 

05:31:00
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:31:00
SAM STEEN What about you? 

05:31:05
ALEJANDRA The same. 

05:31:05
SAM STEEN What does that mean? 

05:31:10
ALEJANDRA The same. Like, proud. 

05:31:10
SHERI BAUMAN So who haven't we heard from? Tyler, what's the most important aspect of who you are, of your identity? 

05:31:20
TYLER Of my identity? I don't know. Probably my age. I, I don't know. Like, I guess your age is kind of like important for everything 'cuz, like, depending on your age, it depends on, you know, a lot of things you can do. Like, the older you get the more freedoms you get and, like, you know. 

05:31:45
SHERI BAUMAN So what are some things... 

05:31:45
JUSTIN (crosstalk) The older you get, the more disabilities you get too. 

05:31:50
SHERI BAUMAN So talk about what you're, you're looking forward to or what you can't do now because you're 13, because that is your age. 

05:32:00
TYLER Uh, definitely driving. I can't wait to, like, be able to, like, I don't have to ask my mom to take me places anymore or, like, I really wanna go do something, I don't have to ask my parents. I can just say I'm gonna go and I can just take myself. You know? So, I can't wait for that. 

05:32:20
SHERI BAUMAN So what would you like the world to understand about 13 year olds? 

05:32:20
TYLER Uh, I don't, like, some, most 13 year olds are more mature than given credit for. Like, a lot of, this is the same with a lot of ages really. Like, sometimes adults will kinda like, like, they'll say oh, it's just a kid. You know, like tell him you can't, don't take 'em seriously but, you know, we, we're sometimes just as mature as some adults. So, you know. 

05:32:50
SHERI BAUMAN So don't underestimate us, huh? 

05:32:55
TYLER Yeah. 

05:32:55
SHERI BAUMAN Cool. Well you certainly taught me that this, you know, in this group, that my expectations were too low in some ways. Tahlia, what about you? 

05:33:05
TAHLIA Um, that I'm a girl and that the boys in school, they used, they would play Whose Side, you know and I would wanna go play with them. You what Whose Side is? 

05:33:20
JUSTIN With the ball? 

05:33:25
TAHLIA Yeah, with the tennis ball and you throw it at the wall? 

05:33:25
SAM STEEN Oh yeah. 

05:33:25
TAHLIA Yeah, that. 

05:33:25
SAM STEEN I remember that. Do you know that one? I thought it was called something different. I didn't know it was called Whose Side. 

05:33:30
JUSTIN (crosstalk (inaudible ). 

05:33:32
SAM STEEN Wall ball, yeah. 

05:33:35
TAHLIA And I would want to play with them but, like, they would say you're too fragile. 

05:33:40
SHERI BAUMAN And what would you want them to understand? 

05:33:40
TAHLIA That I'm not. 

05:33:45
JUSTIN See, that's weird. There's this girl named Rachel at our school and, um, it was, I forget what it was about and she's like, I was like my, I have an older brother. I mean, I have a younger brother who messes around with me and he, like, hits me and stuff on the arm, like, messing around and playing and, and she's like, it doesn't even affect me anymore because we do it so much and she's like, and I was like oh, whatever and she's like what, you don't believe me? And she said to hit me on the arm. I was like no. I mean, it just, it feels uncomfortable to put my hands on a girl like that. I mean, now that might be their point of view. I don't know. It just feels uncomfortable to me. 

05:34:25
SHERI BAUMAN So when Tahlia says we're not so fragile, what does that bring up for you? 

05:34:30
JUSTIN I mean, I still have the same thought. I mean, I've always been taught not to hit girls or anything and I still have that same thought but for her to say that, it's really interesting. 

05:34:40
SAM STEEN What about you Brianna, when you hear him say that? 'Cuz I know how you feel about Tahlia's thing. 

05:34:50
BRIANNA I still think that men shouldn't hit girls, like, even if they're angry 'cuz my dad used to do that and it wasn't very manly of him to do that. He, maybe he just wanted to feel more powerful or something but really he just looked like an idiot. 

05:35:05
SAM STEEN So you're speaking specifically to the hitting part. 

05:35:05
BRIANNA Yeah. 

05:35:10
SAM STEEN What about the part related to her wanting to play a game that they feel like oh, well maybe you're too fragile to play. 

05:35:15
JUSTIN I would have let you play the game. 

05:35:20
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:35:20
JUSTIN I would have let you play with us but I wouldn't have pegged you as hard as I would peg the other kids, the other boys. 

05:35:25
BRIANNA It's just funny to hit guys. I don't know why. 

05:35:25
SAM STEEN It's more fun to hit them. 

05:35:25
BRIANNA Yeah, it's funny. 

05:35:30
SHERI BAUMAN So who haven't we heard from? I think it's Alejandra, huh? 

05:35:35
SAM STEEN I think so. 

05:35:35
ALEJANDRA Um, the same. Gender 'cuz my dream was to join the army and just become, like, a solider in hand to hand combat but they, like I did my research and women can't go into hand to hand combat 'cuz statistics say we'll get raped. We don't have, we're not mentally or emotionally fit to go to the army and just like so many stuff about girls that they can't go. So, like, that was my only dream and I, like, it killed it so I can't really, like, I have to pursue another dream now 'cuz of that. 

05:36:30
SHERI BAUMAN I just wanna give you some information. Two of my students have just come back from, well, one was in Iraq and the other was in Afghanistan and they, one was Air Force and the other was Army and, um, in their view, they didn't miss much of the difficult stuff. They had very tough assignments and very scary assignments. So there are some limits but they have now, you know, opened that door quite a bit wider and women can do lots of things that they didn't used to be able to. 

05:37:05
ALEJANDRA Well, yeah, like, um, if I join the Marines, they'll train me like a regular solider but I can't be in hand to hand combat. The only reason that would be is if I was a nurse and that's pretty much it but I can't, I'm not allowed to shoot a gun, hit by, sorry. It's like, I have to get in the car and leave basically and leave the men to do their work. 

05:37:30
TYLER Wait, so are you saying that, like, female, like, Marines aren't allowed to, like, take a gun and, like, shoot? 

05:37:40
ALEJANDRA Unless... 

05:37:40
TYLER Even if it's defense, like. 

05:37:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:37:40
TYLER Oh, you if you're like defending yourself? 

05:37:40
ALEJANDRA If there's no one left and there's like one person you're supposed to catch, yeah, but. 

05:37:45
TYLER Wow. 

05:37:45
ALEJANDRA They're not really supposed to be, like there's a zone that the women aren't supposed to be in it. 

05:37:50
TYLER And what are the women supposed to do? 

05:37:55
JUSTIN (inaudible ). 

05:37:57
ALEJANDRA Yeah, like. 

05:37:57
TYLER What do they do then? 

05:37:57
JUSTIN That, that's a movie but it's also a real thing. 

05:38:00
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

05:38:00
JUSTIN It's also, it's also, it's like the interior, um, because I wanna be in the Air Force. 

05:38:05
SHERI BAUMAN So I'm, I'm mindful of time, so I'm just gonna suggest that, um, because things are changing all the time and because each branch of the military is different, that you may wanna, um, when you get older and it's really a close decision, find out what the options are for you because they may be much different, especially the way the world has changed. So how shall we close today? 

05:38:30
SAM STEEN I was thinking that, um, we have like five minutes left and if, um, you still have a question that you wanna ask somebody in the room about any thing, 'cuz we only have one session left. We won't have time to do it next session. But look around the room and, you know, we spent the last six sessions with each other. Is there a question that you still have for somebody that, we don't want you to leave here. 

05:38:55
ALEJANDRA I do for Tyler. That one. 

05:38:55
SAM STEEN What'd you say? 

05:38:55
ALEJANDRA I have for Tyler. 

05:39:00
SAM STEEN Yo have a question for Tyler? 

05:39:00
ALEJANDRA Is that one or two? Which one is one. 

05:39:00
TYLER Oh, I, I'm one. 

05:39:00
ALEJANDRA Oh. 

05:39:00
SAM STEEN Rest assured, he's one. But do you understand my point? Like, you understand what I'm asking you? Think about somebody in the room. I wanna ask one or two questions per each kid, member and see what comes up. So you can go first, um, Alejandra, if you have a question for, which Tyler is it? 

05:39:20
ALEJANDRA Tyler number two. 

05:39:20
SAM STEEN So then think if anybody else has a question for Tyler as well, 'cuz we'll stick to him first, okay? 

05:39:25
ALEJANDRA Um, do you, like, since you brought up that girls think guys aren't, they don't have feelings are you, like, emotional like most of the guys or are you just... 

05:39:40
TYLER No, I'm not really emotional. 

05:39:45
ALEJANDRA Like, do you have feelings? 

05:39:45
TYLER Well, yeah, I have feelings but I just don't show them. 

05:39:50
ALEJANDRA So you are like the rest of the guys? 

05:39:50
TYLER Pretty much, yeah. 

05:39:55
ALEJANDRA Oh. 

05:39:55
SAM STEEN Anybody else got a question for Tyler before we move on from him? 

05:40:00
BRIANNA So, like, if one of, like, your family members passed away, you would cry, right? 

05:40:00
TYLER Yeah. 

05:40:05
BRIANNA Okay. 

05:40:05
TYLER I didn't. 

05:40:05
BRIANNA Yeah, I would. 

05:40:05
TYLER You just, like, can't help that kind of stuff. It's just happens. Like, I tried holding back, but when they played this video of, like, pictures of my grandpa and then, like, just like all over. 

05:40:20
SAM STEEN That's a good question. So who else wants to ask the next question of somebody? 

05:40:25
ALEJANDRA You do? 

05:40:25
SAM STEEN You pick a person. 

05:40:25
ALEJANDRA You do? 

05:40:30

05:40:50
ALEJANDRA No, why to you. 

05:40:50
TYLER Oh. 

05:40:50
TYLER Because, like, even though, like right now I see it like practicing and getting used to it 'cuz once you get up in higher levels, more balls are hit up there, out there 'cuz some people can swing better. So. 

05:41:05
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

05:41:05
SAM STEEN Pretty strategic, thinking ahead. Who, um, anybody else wants to ask a question of somebody. So we did Tyler. We should pick somebody else. Who wants to be in the hot seat next? 

05:41:20
SHERI BAUMAN Or just... 

05:41:20

05:41:50
TYLER Yeah, I wish I could tackle somebody like that. 

05:41:50

ALEJANDRA So, like, you have lots of trust in her? 

05:42:10
JUSTIN Mm-hmm. Like I said, like I like her and I know she likes me a lot and I can tell that she likes me because she tells me and she posts about me constantly on her Facebook. I, I have trust in her. Yep.

05:42:50
SAM STEEN Am I allowed to be in the hot seat? 

05:42:50
SHERI BAUMAN I think so. 

05:42:55
SAM STEEN I'm getting nervous. 

05:42:55
JUSTIN I have a question for Sam. 

05:42:55
SAM STEEN Oh, good. Go ahead. 

05:42:55
JUSTIN Um, during your childhood, did you have an easy childhood or hard childhood. 

05:43:00
SAM STEEN It was easy. My dad was in the, uh, military so it was easy in that, um, well, we traveled around a lot so it was fun but it was hard because we were kinda poor but we didn't know, I didn't know I was poor until I got to high school. Everybody in the military was in the same sort of situation. We all shopped at the same stores and all had the same clothes but when we got to the States. I used to live in Germany. When we got to the States, that's when I noticed that we didn't have nice clothes but other kids had, they had really nice clothes and things like that. But overall, it was easy as far as I was concerned. Other than moving and trying to make friends every three years. 'Cuz we moved every three years. 

05:43:40
TYLER Oh, um, so you said you moved every three years. Did you ever have, like, friends that moved with you? 

05:43:50
SAM STEEN Only one time where, they didn't move with me but I, my, I had a very good friend, he was, we're still friends today. He left in the fourth grade. We used to play football together and then he moved to Virginia and then I moved to Virginia around the 8th or 9th grade and met him. Like ran into him, you know, and we stayed friends. We went to the same high school. So that happened. 

05:44:15
ALEJANDRA Have you seen the movie Princess and the Frog? 

05:44:20
SAM STEEN You mean the Disney movie? 

05:44:20

TYLER He was looking that way, so. 

05:45:30

ALEJANDRA Do you guys play sports or you're just hanging around? 

05:45:45
BRIANNA No, we just, we have, like, there's four trees at the back of my school. We go sit under the tree over there and we pretty much just... 

05:45:55
ALEJANDRA Talk. 

05:45:55
BRIANNA Yeah. And sometimes they, like, horse play. 

05:46:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Well, they're guys.

UNKNOWN Tahlia. 

05:46:05
JUSTIN I have a question for Tahlia. (inaudible ). 

05:46:13
SHERI BAUMAN Well I think you should ask Tahlia then. 

05:46:13
JUSTIN Um, when you were in Oregon, well, (inaudible ), did you and your best friend go to school together? 

05:46:20
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:46:20
JUSTIN Oh, okay. Are the schools like the same kind of? 

05:46:25
TAHLIA There was only one school. 

05:46:25
JUSTIN Oh. Is it like the same as the school you go to now, kind of? 

05:46:30
TAHLIA No. 

05:46:30
JUSTIN No, it was completely different? 

05:46:30
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:46:35
BRIANNA Did you like it better? 

05:46:35
TAHLIA Um, I don't know because I didn't go to the middle school there. There was only one elementary school there. So everyone went to that elementary school. I left before middle school. 

05:46:50
SHERI BAUMAN And that was the only elementary school you knew, so you couldn't really compare, huh? 

05:46:55
TAHLIA Yeah. 

05:46:55
TYLER Did you like the weather better, better in Oregon or here? 

05:47:00
TAHLIA It, like, it didn't rain like hard but it was, like, kind of sprinkled every single day. 

05:47:10
JUSTIN My god, I would love that. 

05:47:10
TYLER I know, so would I. That'd be so cool. 

05:47:10
TAHLIA Like where you don't have to wear a jacket all the time, you know? 

05:47:15
JUSTIN I love, like, the dark rainy and stuff. 

05:47:20
SAM STEEN That's because it's hot. 

05:47:20
TAHLIA And there's grass. 

05:47:20
SHERI BAUMAN Like that green stuff I've heard about that sometimes grows on the ground? 

05:47:25
TAHLIA Yeah, and it's not hard. It's soft. 

05:47:30
SAM STEEN You miss that grass? They don't have it here. 

05:47:30
JUSTIN Wow, (inaudible ). 

05:47:34
TYLER They had it in Montana.

05:47:35
SAM STEEN Yeah, were you in the hot seat? All right, go ahead. We have a minute. 

05:47:40
JUSTIN What's your favorite subject in school? 

05:47:45
TYLER Ah man. Well, for me, it really just depends on the teacher 'cuz if it's a good teacher, then I like the subject. So I'd have to say it's math 'cuz I have this teacher named Mr. Schafini (ph). 

05:48:00
JUSTIN Oh yeah. He's cool.

TYLER Probably. I don't know. 

05:49:20
SAM STEEN Now remember earlier, wasn't he the one that said oh, no. I don't wanna talk about girls and all that, right? Now the truth is coming out. 

05:49:30
ALEJANDRA That's why I asked. 

05:49:30
SAM STEEN Good call. 

05:49:30
TYLER It's not that I don't like girls. 

05:49:35
SAM STEEN You just don't wanna spend your time thinking about 'em. 

05:49:35
TYLER No, I just, I just don't have a girlfriend. 

05:49:35
BRIANNA It's cool. We don't have cooties. 

05:49:40
ALEJANDRA Well did, have you taken a risk to ask her out or anything? 

05:49:45
TYLER No. 

05:49:45
ALEJANDRA Why not? 

05:49:45
TYLER 'Cuz I haven't. I don't know. 

05:49:50
ALEJANDRA Are you scared? 

05:49:50
TYLER I guess. I don't know. 

05:49:50
SAM STEEN Maybe next session you can give him some strategies. 

05:49:55
ALEJANDRA I think he is 'cuz he's saying I guess. When guys say that, they're scared or shy. 

05:49:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah, it sounds... 

05:50:00
SHERI BAUMAN Want, want him to have tips, huh? 

05:50:00
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

05:50:00
JUSTIN (inaudible ). 

05:50:03
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. I'm, I'm... 

05:50:03
JUSTIN (inaudible ). I'll teach him. 

05:50:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, you'll, you'll give him lessons? 

05:50:05
JUSTIN Yeah. 

05:50:05
ALEJANDRA You gonna give him the man talk? 

05:50:05
SAM STEEN Give him a few strategies. Yeah, so well, we ran out of time and next time, we have one more session, so we just wanted you to be mindful of that and... 

05:50:15
ALEJANDRA We have one more session? 

05:50:15
SAM STEEN One more. 

05:50:20
ALEJANDRA Whoa. 

05:50:20
SAM STEEN And we'll see you next time. 

05:50:20
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

05:50:20
BRIANNA Okay. 

05:50:20
End of Session 7 

05:50:25
[sil.] 

05:50:25
Session 7 Processing 

05:50:35
[music] 

05:50:35
SAM STEEN Um, how are you doing? We have one session left. 

05:50:40
SHERI BAUMAN One. And we are pushing it on the time, so, what do you think of using the, I, to me, the gifts take a lot more thought and processing time and that we don't have it, unfortunately but that the puzzle would also give them a way to talk about their contributions to the group and the group. 

05:51:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) I agree with that. 

05:51:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. What'd you think about this last session? 

05:51:05
SAM STEEN I don't know. It's, well, let, let's think what happened in there. What was the first activity. 

05:51:15
SHERI BAUMAN Mainly it was the discussion of which of the parts of yourself, you know? Isn't that it? 

05:51:20
SAM STEEN Oh yeah. That, that was a good one. That was a good one because it seemed like they were asking each other questions about it. I like those better when they... 

05:51:25
SHERI BAUMAN I think they're getting more comfortable and not just with each other but with this process and that if we had longer with them, that we'd do less and less and they'd be willing to get to a little bit deeper level. 

05:51:40
SAM STEEN And then they, um, yeah, so I think you're right, that they are becoming more comfortable with it. We were gonna talk about modeling for them, how to use it but we didn't really I guess have to or... 

05:51:55
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I asked you, even, you know... 

05:51:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) I mean it wasn't, it wasn't appropriate. 

05:51:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. A couple times. Well, even in, um, I said at this one, you know, being a female because people think, and just that much, so it feels as though a, we're giving them example 'cuz my instructions clearly didn't get there but the example did and, um, you know, when we were doing the previous activity and you shared a piece, we didn't do the whole activity with them but stepping in mostly to, um, to model how to do it without turning the focus to us. 

05:52:25
SAM STEEN I think coaching them on do more of that, yeah. 

05:52:30
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

05:52:30
SAM STEEN It's, um, I have mixed feelings about it being over. You know, you wonder if we were to ask them what was the most critical sort of situation or the most salient situation, I can't pinpoint one. So I'd be curious to see what they think. 

05:52:45
SHERI BAUMAN I wonder if we can even send that to them and ask them. 

05:52:50
SAM STEEN Well, I think we should have them do it, maybe even once we're done. 

05:52:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

05:52:50
SAM STEEN Before they leave. 

05:52:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, if we can. 

05:52:55
SAM STEEN 'Cuz if we send it to them, they're not gonna do it. 

05:52:55
SHERI BAUMAN Right. Right. 

05:52:55
SAM STEEN Would you agree? They're not gonna do it. But I'm, but I'm just curious. I want to find the time to ask. 

05:53:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) No, I am too. Yeah. So it's amazing, we stretched it out but we still didn't have enough time. So. 

05:53:05
SAM STEEN But that's the only thing I'm curious about is like if we were to ask, I can't pinpoint, like oh, that was the most meaningful aspect for this kid or that kid. So I, I just wanna, I want that to be answered. But that's for my own benefit, not necessarily theirs. SO moving forward, we'll do the puzzle and then we'll try to bring closure to this group as much as we can. 

05:53:25
SHERI BAUMAN And hopefully the puzzle will provide, mostly, the vehicle for that. 

05:53:25
SAM STEEN All right. Well. 

05:53:25
SHERI BAUMAN Let's. 

05:53:25
SAM STEEN Let's do it. 

05:53:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

05:53:25
End of Session 7 Processing 

05:53:30
[sil.] 

05:53:30
Session 8 

05:53:45
[music] 

05:53:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, so we have now spent seven sessions together and this is our last one. So we wanted to do something to sort of, um, capture that we've become a group in the time we've spent together but we're still all individuals with unique aspects of ourselves. So I thought a way we might do that is to construct a puzzle. So what we're gonna do is each of you get a piece and on your piece, you can draw or color something that represents something about you in this group. Something just about what you brought to the group, something about what you got from the group. And then we're gonna put them together and see what sort of our collage of the whole group looks like. And I have pieces for Sam and I too so we're gonna be doing this as well. Okay? So there's two pieces. One is to draw, color, write whatever you want on your piece that represents your experience in this group and your contribution and then, um, we're gonna have to put the puzzle together and then talk a little bit about what it represents. Okay? 

05:55:05
SAM STEEN I would say write on the, not the shiny side 'cuz it won't work. 

05:55:10
SHERI BAUMAN It won't? Okay. 

05:55:10
SAM STEEN Not with those markers. Sorry. 

05:55:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So apologize for the little outline. 

05:55:15
SAM STEEN Yeah, write on the dull side. 

05:55:20
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) On the slight, on the slight, um... 

05:55:20
SAM STEEN Don't worry about. 

05:55:20
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Yeah there. 

05:55:20
SAM STEEN Introduce the puzzle. 

05:55:25
SHERI BAUMAN So grab a piece. 

05:55:25
JUSTIN Here, I'll take the ripped piece since it's my fault. 

05:55:25
SAM STEEN Take one. Oh you ripped it. 

05:55:30
JUSTIN Yeah, by accident. 

05:55:30
SAM STEEN Take one for the team. Can you grab me one Tyler? 

05:55:30
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Mine looks like a (crosstalk (inaudible ). 

05:55:34
BRIANNA Mine looks like an ax. 

05:55:35
UNKNOWN Triangle. 

05:55:35
SAM STEEN Thank you dude. 

05:55:35
JUSTIN No problem. 

05:55:35
SHERI BAUMAN And then can we, let me have some colors again. 

05:55:40
TYLER Okay, so what is this? Sorry. 

05:55:40
SAM STEEN Don't ask me. 

05:55:40
JUSTIN (crosstalk) You would think of it like that. 

05:55:40
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) You guys, oh, they have some over there. 

05:55:40
SAM STEEN Tyler, the other Tyler... 

05:55:45
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) You know what? If you want your notebooky thing to lean on, they're right there. 

05:55:45
SAM STEEN He wants to know what to write on his. 

05:55:50
TYLER I would write Tyler baseball. 

05:55:50
BRIANNA Baseball? 

05:55:55
JUSTIN Why don't you write Tyler one and two? 

05:55:55
UNKNOWN You sure? 

05:55:55
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Why don't we each decide separately? 

05:55:55
JUSTIN Thing one and thing two. 

05:56:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:56:00
SAM STEEN Can somebody, um, repeat the, what we should be writing? 

05:56:05
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Instructions? 

05:56:05
SAM STEEN 'Cuz Tyler said baseball but I don't think that's right. But, maybe I misunderstood. 

05:56:10
UNKNOWN (crosstalk (inaudible ) contributed to the group. 

05:56:11
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:56:11
TYLER Oh, we're supposed to write how we contributed? 

05:56:11
SHERI BAUMAN What you see yourself as contributing or getting from the group. So it's about your experience as a member and drawing it, not say it yet. 

05:56:20
TYLER (crosstalk inaudible ). 

05:56:22
ALEJANDRA How are we supposed to know if we contribute? 

05:56:22
SHERI BAUMAN You guys are just gonna draw it or in a symbol or words or this piece of the puzzle is gonna be... 

05:56:30
TYLER I have no idea. 

05:56:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

05:56:33
SHERI BAUMAN Oh and here. You guys want one to lean on? 

05:56:35
SAM STEEN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

05:56:37
TYLER Okay, that's Tyler one, right? 

05:56:37
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Can you pass the markers? 

05:56:37
TYLER Yeah, I'm Tyler one. 

05:56:40
TYLER So just put one like on the corner of your name and I'll put two. 

05:56:40
TYLER Okay. 

05:56:45
SHERI BAUMAN I mean, you don't have to have names 'cuz we're gonna put this together and make a big puzzle. 

05:56:45
SAM STEEN You can take 'em. I just need one. 

05:56:50
TYLER (crosstalk) Wait, so we write our name on it? 

05:56:50
SHERI BAUMAN No, I mean, you could but more about a symbol or colors or a picture or whatever. I want you to be creative and think about how to visualize, using a visual image of being in the group. 

05:57:10
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk inaudible[05:57:11) 

05:57:10
SHERI BAUMAN So think, think about it. So you could use words but you could use... 

05:57:15
SAM STEEN Remember, art is never wrong, so whatever you, however you draw it. You can also write it if you don't want to draw it. You know what I mean Tyler? You can also write what (inaudible ). 

05:57:29
TYLER No, I just, like... 

05:57:29
SAM STEEN I know you're worried about your drawing but... 

05:57:30
TYLER I'm trying to, like picture the drawing. Can I, I know what I can do. I'm gonna practice my drawing right here. 

05:57:35
SHERI BAUMAN There you go. 

05:57:35
TYLER It's going to look horrible so, no one look. 

05:57:40
TYLER Darn, I put an R. I (inaudible ) something. 

05:57:45
BRIANNA Hap, happer? 

05:57:50
[sil.] 

05:57:50
TYLER Oh, I think I know how to draw it. 

05:58:05
JUSTIN I'm so glad I don't have school tomorrow. 

05:58:05
TYLER What? 

05:58:05
TYLER You don't have school tomorrow? 

05:58:10
TYLER Yeah, I know that. 

05:58:10
TYLER I've got school. 

05:58:10
BRIANNA I don't have to go to school because I don't have to. 

05:58:15
JUSTIN I get a three day weekend. 

05:58:15
ALEJANDRA That's nice. 

05:58:20
JUSTIN But we didn't have, um, spring break either. I mean a fall break. 

05:58:30
TYLER So it's like what you were in the group or something that happened in the group, like... 

05:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN That was meaningful or helpful or... 

05:58:35
SAM STEEN How much time do you need? 

05:58:40
ALEJANDRA Like 15 minutes, maybe less. 

05:58:40
SAM STEEN Maybe three? 

05:58:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

05:58:45
TAHLIA I don't get what we're supposed to do. 

05:58:50
JUSTIN Fifteen minutes, maybe less, could be three. 

05:58:55
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Can we just draw whatever? 

05:58:55
TAHLIA Where are the markers? 

05:58:55
SHERI BAUMAN The markers are over there. Could we have some markers? 

05:59:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) You can draw whatever. 

05:59:00
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Here you go, here's a brown marker. 

05:59:00
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah, Sheri said. 

05:59:00
ALEJANDRA Here. 

05:59:00
SAM STEEN Alejandra, you can draw whatever but Sheri asked you to draw something illustrating either what you got from the group or how you may have contributed to the group. So a symbol about yourself. 

05:59:20
BRIANNA (crosstalk) Here. 

05:59:20
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Hey, do you have a red marker? 

05:59:20
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) No, a red one? 

05:59:20
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Let me get that red marker. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

05:59:21
ALEJANDRA I don't know how I contributed. 

05:59:21
SAM STEEN Okay, then draw something that demonstrates what you may be taking with you from the group. How about that? 

05:59:25
JUSTIN (crosstalk inaudible ). I'm gonna try to make this one 3D. 

05:59:30
ALEJANDRA I'm just gonna draw. 

05:59:30
SHERI BAUMAN You're just gonna draw? That's what I did. Just started. We both did the same thing. It's kinda funny you said that. 

05:59:35
TYLER I'm done. 

05:59:40
SHERI BAUMAN Just hang on to it. 

05:59:45
[sil.] 

05:59:45
SHERI BAUMAN So as you finish your own contribution, let's see if, well, I'll put mine down and someone can try to fit their pieces but we gotta get them together 'cuz they do fit. 

06:00:05
JUSTIN Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well this is straight part. 

06:00:15
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Can I help them? 

06:00:15
TYLER What? 

06:00:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, we can all help but finish your own first. It's just a wait. 

06:00:20
JUSTIN Ours are gonna be corner, I think Tyler.

JUSTIN (crosstalk) Is it gonna make a shape or is it? 

06:00:33
SHERI BAUMAN It makes a, it makes a, you know, it's a rectangle.

BRIANNA (crosstalk) Yeah, 'cuz you can look at that corner, you look at that corner, it's the same thing. 

06:00:40
JUSTIN Oh, okay. 

06:00:45
TYLER Move the thing in the middle. Put the picture in the middle. Like that. 

06:00:50
BRIANNA No, you don't have... 

06:00:50
TYLER No, I think she said, like, just set yours, like, right here. Like that. 

06:00:55
UNKNOWN No, that's not it. 

06:00:55
TYLER Like that? 

06:00:55
BRIANNA Oh my gosh. 

06:00:55
JUSTIN Like how I was putting it? 

06:00:55
BRIANNA Yep. But just no, yes.

JUSTIN Think you're all cool 'cuz you showed me that one. 

06:01:20
SAM STEEN Yeah. Don't be a, don't hate. Congratulate. 

06:01:25
TYLER Oh, look at that. That's probably not right but... 

06:01:25
JUSTIN Yeah it is. It's right. 

06:01:25
TYLER Is it? 

06:01:25
JUSTIN Mm-hm.

BRIANNA That's why it's chopper, 'cuz it's an ax. 

06:01:35
SAM STEEN All right. One more minute to finish your drawing. 

06:01:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible[06:01:41). 

06:01:40
TYLER Yeah, your's is weird. Is it a (inaudible ). 

06:01:46
SAM STEEN It's probably a straight edge, though. 

06:01:46
BRIANNA Where does my ax go? 

06:01:46
TYLER Wait, wait. I have an idea where it goes. No, try. Oh, no that's not it. Hold on, I think I know where this one goes. 

06:02:00
BRIANNA (crosstalk inaudible ). Am I getting the (inaudible ). 

06:02:04
TYLER I think this one goes, goes right. No, that won't work. 

06:02:05
JUSTIN I think this one goes right there. 

06:02:10
TYLER This puzzle is not very good pieces. Like all... 

06:02:15
SAM STEEN What are you trying to say? Just because you can't do it doesn't mean they're not... 

06:02:15
JUSTIN That goes with that and then I think... 

06:02:20
TYLER Happiness. 

06:02:20
SAM STEEN I see that one matches. Alejandra's goes in there. 

06:02:25
JUSTIN Where does your ax go? 

06:02:25
BRIANNA I don't know where my ax goes. 

06:02:30
TYLER Under that line. 

06:02:30
BRIANNA I just know it's on the bottom 'cuz it's got a (inaudible ). That's all I know. Or it could be top. 

06:02:37
TYLER Wait, I have a, wait, wait. Hold on. 

06:02:40
JUSTIN (inaudible ) that. 

06:02:45

SHERI BAUMAN Oh. 

06:03:15
BRIANNA (inaudible 

06:03:20
JUSTIN You guys did the same exact face on your picture? 

06:03:20
TYLER Let me see. Um, okay. I think I overloaded markers here. There. I think someone else needs a, oh. That would be it. 

06:03:35
SHERI BAUMAN I notice you guys are letting Justin do the puzzle. Anybody wanna help? 

06:03:40
TYLER Eh, Justin can handle it. 

06:03:40
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) That one goes exactly right there. 

06:03:40
JUSTIN Hmm? 

06:03:40
TYLER We'll cheer him on from the sidelines. 

06:03:45
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) I'll do it right now. Hold on. 

06:03:45
TYLER Go Justin, go. 

06:03:45
JUSTIN Where does your piece go? 

06:03:50
TYLER Build that puzzle. 

06:03:50
ALEJANDRA Right there. 

06:03:50
TYLER Does this one have a purple? 

06:03:50
JUSTIN Yours is upside down. 

06:03:55
SAM STEEN Is this one like this? 

06:03:55

06:04:02
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

06:04:02
SAM STEEN Oh.

JUSTIN Let me see that one. 

06:04:02
ALEJANDRA Hold on. 

06:04:02
SAM STEEN That was luck. 

06:04:02
TAHLIA That one goes right there. 

06:04:05
TYLER (inaudible ). 

06:04:08
TAHLIA Yeah. 

06:04:10
JUSTIN Oh snap. 

06:04:15
BRIANNA (crosstalk) Oh snap. 

06:04:15
TYLER You're getting good at this now. But hold on now. What's up with that, like, triangle? Like, how are you gonna fix that? 

06:04:20
SAM STEEN It's a pretty tough puzzle, huh? 

06:04:20
TYLER Yeah. 

06:04:20
JUSTIN Yours goes right here. 

06:04:20
SAM STEEN There should be more than one piece left. 

06:04:25
TYLER It's gonna be good. 

06:04:30
BRIANNA I think it goes in the corner. 

06:04:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

06:04:30
BRIANNA Because it's a corner piece. 

06:04:35
TYLER Puzzle is completeness. 

06:04:35
TAHLIA The other way. Over here. 

06:04:35
BRIANNA Over here. On my ax. 

06:04:40
SAM STEEN Yeah, but is there one piece still missing? 

06:04:45
TYLER Yes. 'Cuz there's no way your big triangle is just gonna... 

06:04:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) Sorry. 

06:04:52
SHERI BAUMAN Uh, wait. 

06:04:52
SAM STEEN Well, maybe that one's in the wrong place. His happiness one. 

06:04:55
TYLER Yeah, (crosstalk inaudible ). 

06:05:00
JUSTIN Oh, it goes right here. 

06:05:00
SAM STEEN There you go. 

06:05:00
SHERI BAUMAN Aha. See, we're making... 

06:05:00
JUSTIN I hope this big triangle does make it a puzzle. 

06:05:05
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) See, everybody was really saying... 

06:05:05
SAM STEEN That the puzzle stinks. 

06:05:05
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

06:05:05
TYLER The puzzle was incomplete. 

06:05:10
SAM STEEN Yay. 

06:05:10
TYLER (inaudible ) Tyler. 

06:05:14
SHERI BAUMAN So there's our group as a whole. How about each one say just a few words about what you were representing in your piece of the puzzle and then anything you'd like to say to the group or anyone in it before we end. 

06:05:25
JUSTIN Um, I drew a football. Well, first I drew my dad's football number, which is also my football number and I, in doing that, I hope I brought part of him, because I've always wanted to be like my father. I hope I brought part of him to the group and, um, and then the football represents take some of the skills I learned to help express myself and, um, help other people in the group onto my football team and become a better leader. So that's what that's about. 

06:06:00
SHERI BAUMAN Someone else? 

06:06:05
TYLER Well. Mine's about my, my guy is the face one 'cuz it's, and the, the squiggly lines coming out of his mouth are supposed to be like words, like talking, um, 'cuz, like, I learned a lot from people, like, how people, like what people said and I hope that other people learned something from what I said and then I wrote that I'm the number one Tyler. So yeah. 

06:06:35
SHERI BAUMAN Thanks. 

06:06:35
SAM STEEN In case anybody's wondering. 

06:06:35
TYLER I put happiness because I gained happiness from coming to this. 

06:06:45
SAM STEEN Was that a surprise for you? 

06:06:45
TYLER Yes. Well, not really. Um, kind of, yeah. 

06:06:50
JUSTIN Do you always draw a T and then scribble it out? 

06:06:50
TYLER Yeah. 

06:06:55
JUSTIN What for? 

06:06:55
TYLER 'Cuz I always mess up. 

06:06:55
SHERI BAUMAN Bri, wanna tell us about your piece? Which one's yours? 

06:07:05
BRIANNA The ax. 

06:07:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, that's right. How could I forget? 

06:07:05
JUSTIN Chopper. Gonna chop? 

06:07:10
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) So tell us what you were representing there. 

06:07:10
BRIANNA I put a smiley face 'cuz I like smiley faces and I put a heart. 

06:07:15
ALEJANDRA Because you like hearts? 

06:07:20
BRIANNA Because, I was gonna say that. 

06:07:20
ALEJANDRA I knew you were gonna. 

06:07:20
BRIANNA And I put a heart because, like, I learned that I can love my family a little bit more. Then I put friends because we became friends and I learned about life. Ta-da. 

06:07:40
TYLER Did you learn about happiness? 

06:07:40
BRIANNA Yeah. How to be happy. 

06:07:45
SAM STEEN I find it interesting to hear you say you learned how to love your, your family more, considering that we didn't really directly talk about families. Maybe indirectly. So thanks for sharing. 

06:08:00
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Do I share mine? 

06:08:00
SHERI BAUMAN Please. 

06:08:05
ALEJANDRA Um, I learned trust. That was one of my issues and I learned about it. Uh, the rest is doodling. 

06:08:20
SHERI BAUMAN You wrote, there's some words down there besides trust. What does that say? 

06:08:25
ALEJANDRA Um. 

06:08:25
TAHLIA Seven months. 

06:08:25
ALEJANDRA Seven months. 

06:08:25
SHERI BAUMAN Does that mean something? 

06:08:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

06:08:30
SHERI BAUMAN Can you tell us? 

06:08:30
ALEJANDRA That's how long I've been with my boyfriend. 

06:08:30
TYLER I knew it. I knew it. 

06:08:35
SAM STEEN You already knew, huh? 

06:08:35
TYLER I knew it. I was just waiting for you to say it. 

06:08:35
SAM STEEN So the trust, is it the trust of each other? 

06:08:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

06:08:41
SAM STEEN Or is it the trust of your boyfriend again? 

06:08:41
ALEJANDRA No. It's the trust of each other. 

06:08:41
SAM STEEN Trust of each other. Did you hear that Justin? 

06:08:45
JUSTIN Huh? 

06:08:45
SAM STEEN She feels like she can trust the people in this room. 

06:08:50
JUSTIN What about, can you trust your boyfriend a little bit more? 

06:08:50
ALEJANDRA I mean, I do trust him. Like, besides my best friend, he knows everything, you know? Um, it's not that I don't trust him. Maybe I don't trust who he hangs out with. Maybe they might be bad influence. Like, I honestly don't know what happens when the guys hang out with the guys, you know? So it's like, yeah. 

06:09:20
SHERI BAUMAN Tahlia, can you tell us about you? 

06:09:25
TAHLIA Um, well, there's a person talking because we're talking and then we have an open mind, so like I put the brain open. 

06:09:40
TYLER Well, that's cool. 

06:09:45
TAHLIA And then I put a book 'cuz I love books and a smiley face because it's like this is like a happy place, I guess. You know?And that lightning bolt is, uh, Harry Potter. 

06:10:00
ALEJANDRA Really? I thought it was Zeus. 

06:10:00
SHERI BAUMAN Sam, can you tell us about yours? 

06:10:10
SAM STEEN Mine, let me see what I drew. Um, is, uh, I think it's supposed to be a river. At first I was gonna do a waterfall but I didn't, so that's a river. And we were all in this windy, so it's more like a group sort of thing. Like I saw this as a all of us taking this journey down this river. Uh, one direction the river's going downstream, it's a little easier and one direction, the river's going upstream. Sometimes it's harder. I don't really know what else I was trying to say in that picture other than I like to draw houses and trees. That was it. 

06:10:40
SHERI BAUMAN And mine is the different mountains. I'm thinking, I was thinking of Colorado, that are all separate but when they come together, they make a beautiful mountain range. So I was thinking about the separate people in the, in the group and the, they're different sizes and shapes but together, sort of like the puzzle, they make something better than just the individuals and then those were, they started out to be clouds and then they ended up to be, um, you know, chain link so, the same sort of concept. 

06:11:15
SAM STEEN So in closing, we'll have you, on your way out, write down what was the most meaningful aspect of being here with us and maybe something that you're gonna take away with you but as far as bringing closure to this, anybody have any last they wanna say, because we're officially done. 

06:11:35
ALEJANDRA Me. 

06:11:35
SAM STEEN What do you mean? 

06:11:35
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Find me on Facebook. 

06:11:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah, find me on Facebook. Tumblr, Twitter, and (inaudible ). You guys should tell, um, your teachers or principals about my blog about anti-bullyness awareness. 

06:11:45
SHERI BAUMAN I'm definitely gonna check that out. So (crosstalk inaudible ). 

06:11:52
TYLER (crosstalk) I need you guys', I need your, I need your last names. 

06:11:55
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Oh yeah, my... 

06:11:55
ALEJANDRA Rayes. 

06:11:55
BRIANNA I'm gonna make a Facebook, 'cuz mine got hacked. 

06:11:55
SAM STEEN You're gonna get one? 

06:12:00
BRIANNA Yeah. 

06:12:00
SHERI BAUMAN So do I hear that some of you wanna stay in touch? 

06:12:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

06:12:00
JUSTIN (crosstalk) Yeah. Everybody friend me on Facebook. My name is spelled weird though. I have a capital T and a capital N. 

06:12:05
ALEJANDRA Wait, what is it? What's your name? 

06:12:10
TAHLIA (crosstalk) For Justin? 

06:12:10
JUSTIN Yeah. Capital T and a capital N. 

06:12:10
ALEJANDRA Is my panda pretty? 

06:12:15
TYLER Wait, do we get to, like, take these? 

06:12:15
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yes you can. 

06:12:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yes, you can take those. 

06:12:20
TYLER I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna write down your name. 

06:12:20
ALEJANDRA (crosstalk) Really, 'cuz (crosstalk inaudible ). 

06:12:23
SAM STEEN So, thank you. See you next week and see you next year and see you on TV. 

06:12:25
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Thanks and if you'll stop and see me on your way out, I have something for you and something for you to sign. 

06:12:30

06:12:30
SHERI BAUMAN So thanks. That was a, a major effort.

06:12:37
TYLER Hey Justin.

06:12:40
Session 8 Processing 

06:12:50
[music] 

06:12:50
SAM STEEN Well, that was our last session and I think the kids were ready to go. 

06:12:55
SHERI BAUMAN And I think they rushed the last session, unfortunately. 

06:13:00
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

06:13:00
SHERI BAUMAN But I felt, given that we were rushed, trying to do one more, I don't know what the word would be, in, uh, deeper, more thoughtful, I, processing would have been compromised, so do it on a bit of a lighter level but giving them a chance to say something and it sounds like they intend to keep in touch. It'll be interesting to see if they do. 

06:13:30
SAM STEEN Yeah. Which is as meaningful or more meaningful than anything they could have said in that last session. You know what I mean? As a culminating sort of experience. So overall, how do you feel like these eight sessions went? 

06:13:45
SHERI BAUMAN I think, I'm not sure I can articulate it. I think there was some meaningful moments and that they all learned something about building friendships and trust and did a little introspection and a little social learning from each other. So I think my, I always look for more of those moments and that's not realistic and I think the one thing that struck me was because of the way we filmed this, it really doesn't capture what it would be like if they had a week in between. You know, I think we see fatigue and we don't see the opportunity for them to apply and... 

06:14:45
SAM STEEN Come back and say guess what? 

06:14:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

06:14:45
SAM STEEN I talked to my boyfriend and... 

06:14:45
SHERI BAUMAN And what you said was helpful or that sort of thing. 

06:14:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Yeah, right. That's a good point. So for the sake of what we actually did produce, I think overall it came out about as good as it could come out. You know, in that respect. 

06:15:00
SHERI BAUMAN And I think, you know, I think we were flexible in some ways, that we modified considerably what we had originally planned based on what we saw, uh, happening in the group and it was interesting. At first, I thought Justin was gonna be a very reluctant participant who was gonna require a lot of drawing out. 

06:15:25
SAM STEEN What made you think that initially? I'm just curious. 

06:15:25
SHERI BAUMAN I think, it may have been the very first, I wanna think the information session. 

06:15:35
SAM STEEN Whenever you initially made... 

06:15:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, or that, that he seemed pretty reticent and I wondered, you know, how engaged he would be but he turned out to be quite a dominant member of the group. 

06:15:50
SAM STEEN Definitely comfortable sharing his opinion. He seemed to be a care taker, too, of other people. You notice that? 

06:16:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, and it followed very much from the way he describes his role in the family. 

06:16:05
SAM STEEN That's true. 

06:16:05
SHERI BAUMAN And I thought Tyler number one, um, was a, a real genuine kid. He surprised me also with, you know, some of the insights that, that he gained. 

06:16:20
SAM STEEN The, the most surprising thing to me was that he had a girl that he liked. Just because he was so adamant about oh no, I don't have time for that. That to me was surprising. Not necessarily that important but definitely surprising. 

06:16:30
SHERI BAUMAN And you know what? That was a huge relief to me. We hear so much about kids, you know, accelerating socially before they're ready and being in these, you know, most of them have had very minimal kinds of romantic relationships and they kind of acknowledged that they're not, they don't really quite know how to do this thing. 

06:16:50
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) What's going on. Right. 

06:16:50
SHERI BAUMAN And, and so forth. So, um. 

06:16:55
SAM STEEN The part about Alejandra having, um, sharing her issues. She had said either between one of the sessions or in session that my dad thinks I need counseling anyway. Did you hear her say that? 

06:17:10
SHERI BAUMAN No. 

06:17:10
SAM STEEN So she must have said it at the end of a session. So for her to have that opportunity to explore that, it was about their relationships but it seemed like there was more going on then just that particular relationship. 

06:17:20
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you know, and I think we have to remember that because in, in contacting these kids, even though we didn't get a chance to interview, I know that none of them had been in any kind of a group or counseling and I also noticed that, although Alejandra continued to giggle and, you know, twirl her hair and so forth, that was less pronounced over the sessions. That seemed like as she got, felt safer and, and more trusting, she didn't need that and she also didn't, I mean, you can't discount her and Tahlia's friendship. 

06:17:55
SAM STEEN (crosstalk) Tahlia's relationship. 

06:17:55
SHERI BAUMAN But nevertheless, I think they became less dependent on one another as time went by. So I thought... 

06:18:00
SAM STEEN It definitely helped with the seating arrangements, that's for sure. 

06:18:05
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

06:18:05
SAM STEEN Where they would have had to make a more effort to see each other. 

06:18:10
SHERI BAUMAN Right. But I think maybe that was happening also as a result of the bond, the other bonds, that it wasn't so necessary to have that approval. 

06:18:15
SAM STEEN They filled out the questionnaire saying what was the most significant or salient aspect of the group. I didn't read 'em yet, so it'd be, I'm looking forward to seeing what they felt like was the most important but Alejandra ended on saying trust, that she felt trust and I wasn't sure if she meant for her boyfriend or the group. She said for the group. Justin didn't hear me and he asked are you referring to your boyfriend and she said something like it's not that I don't trust him or whatever. So it was just neat to see that yes, she was able to express that she also felt like she could trust the people here too. That was an, a significant point for me. 

06:18:55
SHERI BAUMAN And I think she tested the water several times. Can I say this? Can I ask this? And that stopped happening, you know, over the last few. 

06:19:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. So how do we end sort of this processing piece, I mean? Or this overall, this. 

06:19:15
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I, I wanna say as, I have again, I think in many ways, we have very different styles but we also complement one another, at least that's how I see it and I feel, um, honored really to get a chance to do this with you again and I love watching you with kids. 

06:19:30
SAM STEEN Well, I enjoy doing it as well and co-leading with you and I learn a lot too. Like I said earlier, I guess I was clear back then about being able to process and facilitate the activity at the same time and the questions that you ask, they often time, the kids don't always get it but they are, but the questions are trying to get them to go a little bit deeper and that's something that I notice more, um, clearly this time than I did the first time that we did it. So I'd like to incorporate some of that into the work that I do and hopefully we get a chance to do it again and if we were to do it again, if you were to brainstorm, apart for the virtual stuff 'cuz I know you mentioned that. What age group do you think you'd be interested in? 

06:20:15
SHERI BAUMAN I like 'em all, frankly. Um, and I think, uh, judging from the difference between the 5th and the 8th grade in the process, even like 10th grade or 12th, it'd be interesting to watch developmentally as things, as they become more themselves. As, as they, um, encounter new challenges when they are in high school and, um, they're excited about it but they're not real sure what that means or when they finally get that driver's license or the things that seem so far away, I think that's, and they have of course the next hurdle. They've got to think about (crosstalk inaudible ). 

06:20:59
SAM STEEN So all the transitioning issues you're talking about. 

06:20:59
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. 

06:20:59
SAM STEEN Well, yeah. And then I wonder. This is the last comment 'cuz I know we began by saying we're going to explore race, ethnicity, and culture. 

06:21:05
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. 

06:21:05
SAM STEEN And then we broadened it to say diversity, gender, religion, you know, sexuality, etc. You know, do we, did we accomplish that? After watching the 5th grade video, I said well, in some cases, there are points where we can say yeah, these activities drove that message. Here, there are few where you can say it drove that message but then you wonder. Did we really accomplish what we set out? And I don't have an answer for it but I'd like to hear what you think. 

06:21:30
SHERI BAUMAN I don't have an answer either. I thought, again, that there were moments, moments of surprise, moments of intent consciousness, and I think that's, that if, if they took away one awareness related to those areas, that we could feel like we accomplished it. 

06:21:55
SAM STEEN I see what you mean. 

06:21:55
SHERI BAUMAN I mean, I think, I, based on our own agreement, I think we definitely intentionally broached those subjects, that we structured some of the activities to provide an opportunity for those subjects to come up, and that the kids took it from there. 

06:22:15
SAM STEEN And that's a good, maybe that's what it is. Because we, I can't say oh, we did this or we did that. It's more that they were able to drive those sessions after a while. So we're not fully responsible for it. We're fully responsible for just creating an environment and we could have forced them back to this topic but if it wasn't something that they necessarily wanted to talk about, then it's okay. 

06:22:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I'm not sure they didn't want to but I think it came up enough, um, but we allowed it to, to broaden a little bit in terms of... 

06:22:50
SAM STEEN No, I understand. That makes sense to me. Is that we couldn't force it. 

06:22:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

06:22:50
SAM STEEN So we provided the venue and then they get to pick and choose. We didn't have to keep bringing it, bringing it, and bringing it back because then we're accomplishing our sort of mission of the video versus what the kids really needed at that time. 

06:23:05
SHERI BAUMAN (crosstalk) Right. 

06:23:05
SAM STEEN Does that make sense? 

06:23:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yes. I was thinking family didn't come up very much and, or we didn't, we didn't focus on that, but that's another (crosstalk inaudible ). 

06:23:18
SAM STEEN It didn't come up explicitly, intentionally but you heard Brianna's comment about I can love my family even more, which I thought was very powerful for her to say that. Maybe hearing Justin talk or Tyler talk about their families, I'm not sure, but yeah. 

06:23:30
SHERI BAUMAN Well, the other thing is, I bet the kids were tired 'cuz I'm really tired. 

06:23:35
SAM STEEN Yeah, that's true. Well hopefully we get an opportunity to do it again. If we do, I'd consider myself lucky to work with you again. 

06:23:45
SHERI BAUMAN Same here. 

06:23:45
SAM STEEN And we can explore what that population or, you know, what those kids will look like. 

06:23:50
SHERI BAUMAN And the other thing I'd like to say is that I hope anybody watching this and using it for instruction can benefit from not only what we did well but what we didn't and observe some real, um... 

06:24:00
SAM STEEN Groups in action. You know? 

06:24:05
SHERI BAUMAN Groups in action, 8th graders from a variety of, uh, kind of walks or and that it'll be a contribution 'cuz that's why we did it. 

06:24:15
SAM STEEN And if you have any feedback, we look forward to hearing from you as well.
