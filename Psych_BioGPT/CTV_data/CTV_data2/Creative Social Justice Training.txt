RITA CHI-YING CHUNG To ensure that the counseling and mental health professions are current about social issues that impact our client's lives, counselors have broaden the discussion on multiculturalism to include social justice. An important aspect of this expanded discussion is how to infuse social justice in graduate counseling training. 

00:00:40
FRED BEMAK Although some counseling graduate programs have integrated social justice into course work very few have developed a stand-alone class or infused social justice throughout the curriculum. Even so, social justice continues to be an important concern in the counseling field requiring careful attention in counseling training. Since social justice issues encountered by clients are highly complex and multidimensional, creative teaching approaches to tease out these intricacies are necessary. 

00:01:15
Ethnographic Fiction (EF) is a creative technique that gives students a glimpse into their clients' lives and experiences by providing students with an opportunity to "walk in the shoes of their clients". Clients' experiences are examined from Multiple perspectives that include issues of: - Power - Cultural values - Worldviews - Sociopolitical Issues - Historical and Ecological Viewpoints - Socioeconomic Status - Racism and Discrimination - Biases - Privilege - Conflicts - Emotions - Ambiguity

FRED BEMAK Ethnographic Fiction is a creative technique that gives students a glimpse into their clients' lives and experiences by providing students with an opportunity to "walk in the shoes of their clients." As a result, students become aware, understand and acknowledge the impact of social injustices on clients lives using Ethnographic Fiction clients' life experiences are examined from multiple perspectives that include issues of power, cultural values, worldviews, sociopolitical issues, historical and ecological viewpoints, socioeconomic status, racism and discrimination, biases, privilege, conflicts, emotions, and ambiguity that are intertwined and in present day society are important elements in constructing a sense of self. Ethnographic Fiction is a tool that examines that multidimensionality of clients' life experiences and challenges in a powerful and creative educational format. The aim of using Ethnographic Fiction is fourfold. 

00:02:35
1. to educate students about the complexity and multidimensionality of social justice issues encountered by clients 2. To promote an in-depth understanding of how social justice applies to counseling 3. To motivate students' commitment to integrate social justice into counseling 4. To inspire counselor trainees to explore strategies and interventions to become proactive social justice counselors who address inequalities and disparities 

00:02:35
FRED BEMAK First to educate students about the complexity and multidimensionality of social justice issues encountered by their clients. Secondly, to promote an in-depth understanding of how social justice applies to counseling. Third, to motivate students' commitment to integrate social justice into counseling and fourth, to inspire counselor trainees to explore strategies and interventions to become proactive social justice counselors who address inequalities and disparities. 

00:03:20
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Ethnographic Fiction originated in anthropology and as a technique that involved story telling or telling other narrative. It is a creative method in developing and delivering a story or situation that is compelled by using various research methodologies based on a combination of research findings, factual events, and individual's antidotal experiences. Ethnographic Fiction explicitly draws on research data based on real people and events and represent situations that actually happens through the shaping and dramatizing of factual evidence through the fictional techniques. Ethnographic Fiction is not creative fiction since creative fiction does not necessarily rely on historical facts and data. Through this method research evidence is presented using fictional characters where the author or narrator tells a story for a fictional character's narrative. The story involves describing a particular scene or scenario and recording the research by depicting or mirroring and assisting realities. The use of Ethnographic Fiction promotes an in-depth appreciation, understanding, and awareness about social injustices encountered by the client, and as a useful technique in training future social justice-orientated counselors. Our premise is that Ethnographic Fiction can be used in any course in graduate training for mental health professionals. 

00:05:00
FRED BEMAK The purpose of Ethnographic Fiction is to engage all participants that is the author or narrator and participants or audience in the actual story. As the author/narrator presents the character's emotional responses to the social justice situation, the participants are drawn into the story. This technique is highly effective, allowing the narrator to be immersed in the immediacy and the vividness of the character's life situation and experience while viscerally acting out and experiencing the world of the client, resulting in Ethnographic Fiction becoming a powerful educational tool with all the participants in the classroom emotionally engaged in the story. 

00:05:50
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG By using Ethnographic Fiction students become the client and present his or her life experiences and current challenges stimulated life-like encounter while classmates or participants' audience ask questions and challenge the student in the client role. Although the characters or clients are fictitious, the events presented in present tense are authentic and based on research that consist of a combination of empirical findings, biographies, case studies and interviews. Ethnographic Fiction allow students or offer narrator to develop creative ways to describe the experiences of a client social justice situation where classmates or audience can imaginatively feel their way into the experience being described by the author/narrator. Therefore, Ethnographic Fiction incorporates a combination of mixed research methodology, creativity, and analytical thinking that simulates new dimensions in student learning. 

00:07:00
FRED BEMAK The use of Ethnographic Fiction requires that students personalize the research findings by actually becoming the character and subsequently feeling, thinking, behaving and reacting as the person in the story that they are recreating. By placing the student/author as a key character in the story, the technique uses reflexivity as a narrative tool so that rather than simply memorizing and factually reciting research findings the character comes alive with the reenactment of the personality and the psychosocial and social justice experiences of the person being presented. As a result of the students' emotional narration of the characters' life, their classmates or the audience gains a firsthand experience of the social justice issues facing the character and identifies with the character rather than gaining a limited understanding and experience of their clients through standard research. By simply telling the story third hand through observation and reflection about issues or using strictly media presentations, students run the risk of acquiring an intellectual-only knowledge of social injustices. By telling stories in first person, students become key characters in the story so that the narrative becomes their narrative and evolves into the student telling my story as the character. 

00:08:40
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Essentially students are giving voice to the character which in real life may not have had an opportunity to be heard. Interestingly, many students present their character story while addressing as that person to create a full impact and effect. At times, the story presentation are highly emotional so that both the narrator and audience are tearful or outraged. These powerful moments are frequently carried through the, the semester and record spontaneously by students in future class discussions. Oftentimes, students become advocates for the characters in the related social justice issue by bringing character-related material to class throughout the semester and become advocates outside the class. For example, one student was assigned a character, he was homeless and was confronted by her own negative stereotypes of the homeless population. As the semester progressed, she began to educate not only her classmates but also her family members, friends and colleagues about the realities of homelessness. Simultaneously, she organize a food and clothing drive for a homeless shelter that targeted students and the counseling program and personally delivered the clothing to homeless individuals. So Ethnographic Fiction moves student from awareness or critical consciousness about social injustices to proactive action. 

00:10:10
FRED BEMAK We received consistent feedback of the Ethnographic Fiction assignment as being a transformative impact on professional and personal lives of students. The comments consist of... 

00:10:25
"I personally felt Ethnographic Fiction was one of the most unique and informative projects I've done as a student, period. I learned so much about my character and the other characters presented and feel a heightened level of awareness as to the environmental issues that my trigger of the behaviors or situations clients come into and address in counseling"

UNKNOWN I personally felt Ethnographic Fiction was one of the most unique and informative projects I've done as a student, period. I learned so much about my character and the other characters presented and feel a heightened level of awareness as to the environmental issues that may trigger of the behaviors or situations clients come into and address in counseling. 

00:10:45
"This is one of the most unique projects in the counseling program, but I would venture to say that this project impacted me more than any other project and was one of the most challenging at the same time... Not only did I learn a tremendous amount, but I had an opportunity to step into my character's shoes. I don't think that there was a better way to really tap into my character's experience than through this assignment"

00:11:10
"This was definitely one of the most challenging assignments that I have had. It was also the one where I experienced the most growth. After listening to experience after experience of injustices, my heart was heavy and my mind was deep in thought. These were all real people with real issues just like our clients... I was able to feel their struggle if only for a few minutes. The 'realness' of the assignment cannot be underestimated"

"I think the assignment is really a stroke of genius. I learned so much more from the assignment than from a straight research paper. I wasn't sure about it at first, but I think it's one of the best assignments I have ever had. By having to research our character and think about what environmental influences have shaped them, you get inside their world, and get to understand what their thoughts are. You really get a sense of their worldview... ...By having us portray these characters, the whole class got a glimpse into so many different lives... I think the true test of a really effective learning experience is if you remember it. Most papers I will not remember, this one I will"

- Poverty - Health care - Immigration - Education - Homophobia - Gun violence - Interpersonal violence - Abuse - Racism - HIV/AIDS - Sexism - Abelism - Mental Illness - Ageism- Discrimination - Oppression 

00:12:20
FRED BEMAK Social justice characters are developed by the instructor and derived from current national and global social issues. For example, we take issues of poverty, health care, immigration, education, homophobia, gun violence, interpersonal violence, abuse, racism, HIV/AIDS, sexism, abelism, mental illness, ageism, discrimination, oppression, etcetera to represent a wide-range of social justice issues relevant to counseling. 

00:12:55
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG In the first class, the instructor provides each student with a short statement that briefly describes a character social justice situation. Each students received a different character with a different social justice issue. Each student in the class portraying a different character, students have an opportunity to learn about various social injustices. An example of a character's description that is given to the student is. 

00:13:25
Carla is a 62 year old African American. She was just diagnosed with heart disease. She has had health problems for the past 7 years and has been to multiple doctors complaining of pains in her chest. She feels that the doctors have not taken her concern seriously. After minimal tests they told her that it was really nothing serious. Carla's boss, who is a 55 year old Caucasian woman, recently experienced chest pains and was immediately diagnosed with angina after extensive testing, and is now on medication.

FRED BEMAK Carla is a 62 year old African-American. She was just diagnosed with heart disease. She has had health problems for the past 7 years and has been to multiple doctors complaining of pains in her chest. She feels that the doctors have not taken her concern seriously. After minimal tests they told her that it was really nothing serious. Carla's boss, who is a 55 year old Caucasian woman, recently experienced chest pains and was immediately diagnosed with angina after extensive testing, and is now on medication. 

00:14:10
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG So the social justice issue for Carla is racial and socioeconomic discrimination and disparity and health care. When students present their characters some may dress the part of the character for full impact. For example, this is a photo of Heliot(ph), an African-American male student in his mid-20s. During his presentation of Carla, he decided to dress the part as shown in this photo. 

00:14:35
FRED BEMAK The next portion of the video will be four students presenting their social justice character. Let's assume that as an instructor, I have given the students four different social justice situations. After each presentation, Rita and I will ask the students questions to ascertain the depth of their understanding of their character situation. 

00:15:00
Mary 

00:15:05
MARY I can't hardly believe it's been over a month since we buried Joey(ph). No parent ever expects to bury their child. Someday as I still feel like I wake up and this will all have been a dream but most days I know I'm living a nightmare. Because of all the new stories, there's so much I never knew, so much I wish I had known like how tooth decay, they call it dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease in America. Like how $80 could have saved my son. If only I had had $80 and could have found a dentist willing to take Medicaid. Basically, I never knew how important routine dental care was and because of my lack of knowledge Joey(ph) is now dead. Everyone is always talking about health insurance and we got Joey(ph) the best health insurance Medicaid would provide. He was up-to-date in all his vaccinations. We monitored his asthma. His doctor said he was growing well but no one ever asked about his teeth and his oral health. And I didn't know that dental caries was five times as common as asthma and could be deadly. The one time I did try to find a dentist for Joey(ph), it was an hour away and they only took appointments during a school day. What was I supposed to do? Miss work? Pull Joey(ph) out of school? Take a 2-hour bus ride each way only to be told that he really wasn't covered? There would be additional expenses or there needed to be a follow up visit? How did we come to be on Medicaid? Well, if you live in Virginia and you have a child under 18 and you're poor enough, you qualify for Medicaid. Your income just can't be higher than the income limits set by the city or town you live in. That's why we moved around so much trying to find a place where we could work and still get benefits. It's amazing how making just a little bit of money and makes you too rich to qualify for Medicaid and yet too poor to put a roof over your head and food in your belly consistently. Being poor, being from rural Virginia, being African-American, being on Medicaid, all these things put Joey(ph) at an increased risk for untreated dental caries. I know because it was in the pamphlet they gave me in the ER. Poor kids are twice as likely to have dental caries and yet less than 20% of Medicaid eligible children receive preventive dental care annually. Anyway, about a month before Joey(ph) died, he was complaining about his tooth aching. His dad and I thought about trying to find a dentist that would take Medicaid but they had been so difficult the first time. We thought we just treat it the best way we knew how. So we gave him Advil and other over-the-counter medicines for the pain but nothing seemed to help. The night we took him to the emergency room he was so sick. He was complaining about the pain and he was very feverish. You know people say that folks with Medicare use the emergency room for routine care but we had never taken Joey(ph) to the emergency room. And the one time we did, it was a real emergency. It turns out that people with Medicaid and people with private insurance all use the emergency room at the same rate and for the same reason, emergencies. The doctor told us that Joey(ph) had an infected tooth and the tooth abscess had spread to his brain. They rushed him into surgery immediately. His dad and I were in shock. We never saw Joey(ph) alive again. After surgery, he was in critical condition in the ICU. They told us to go home. They told us to rest and they'd call us when we could come to see him. When they did call it was to say he had slipped away. We took our 12-year-old son in with a tooth ache and walked out with a death certificate. 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:20
MARY How do I feel? How do you think I feel? I'm heartbroken. No mother should bury her child. I'm sad for all the things Joey(ph) didn't get to do and all the things we didn't get to do with him and I'm angry. If there was all this information about the importance of preventive dental care, why didn't someone tell me? I'm angry at the doctors. I'm angry at the dentists. I'm angry at the politicians who have called to express their condolences and their outrage and to pledge that this would never happen again but it did happen. In all their flowery words and fake tears and empty pledges won't bring Joey(ph) back. They won't bring my Joey(ph) back. Most of all I'm angry at myself. A mother is supposed to take care of her child. A mother is supposed to know what's important and what's not. A mother is supposed to know what to do, because of my lack of knowledge Joey(ph) is dead and I don't know if I can live with that pain. My name is Mary. 

00:21:55
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Mary, how are you dealing with the loss of Joey(ph)? 

00:22:05
MARY I don't know that you deal with the loss of your child. I don't understand that question, how am I dealing with it? I'm not dealing with it. 

00:22:15
FRED BEMAK Mary, when you walk down the street, how was this changed your life? 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:30
MARY I wonder what else, I don't know. We have other children. I wonder if I'm doing the best I can for them because I was so wrong with Joey(ph). 

00:22:45
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Mary, do you think you're a good mother? 

00:22:50
MARY I love my children and before this I thought I was but I was responsible for taking care of him, for making sure he was safe and healthy and I didn't. 

00:23:05
FRED BEMAK How are you... 

00:23:05
MARY So maybe I'm not. 

00:23:10
FRED BEMAK How are you and your husband doing in this moment? 

00:23:15
MARY I'm so thankful for him. It's been so hard. He tells me not to blame myself. He tells me that it's not my fault but he doesn't understand cuz he's not a mother. A mother understands, it was my fault. 

00:23:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Mary, if Joey(ph) was standing here, what would you say to him? Just pretend he was standing here, what would you like to say to him? 

00:23:40
MARY I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you so much. I love you so much I. I'm just so sorry mommy didn't know. Mommy didn't know. 

00:24:05
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Ma-- Mary, it seems like you're blaming yourself for what happened to Joey(ph). Are you responsible for living in low income situation? 

00:24:20
MARY After high school I had to go to work and I couldn't go to college but may be things have been different. I could have gone to college and I would have made more money and we wouldn't-- been living in low income. I could have made some different choices. 

00:24:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG So you still blame yourself? 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:24:45
MARY I wish-- I feel like the doctors that somebody else should have helped us but I don't have a name, I don't have a person who did help. I'm the only person I know who didn't do what they were supposed to do. 

00:25:05
FRED BEMAK Do you, do you think Mary the doctors not informing you of something that happens to many people or just some people? 

00:25:15
MARY Who, at my church, we talked about it and I have a dental clinic coming in because when other people at my church heard my story, nobody knew. Their kids hadn't been into the dentist regularly and now with all the media attention we can get a dentist to come to our community. So every Sunday after church you can get free dental cleanings. So I know other people didn't know. 

00:25:40
FRED BEMAK And it took Joey's(ph) life to do this. 

00:25:45
MARY Joey's(ph) death, the death of my baby. 

00:25:55

00:25:55
Fatima 

00:26:00
FATIMA My country is in chaos. The land is stained red with the blood of over 300,000 of my people. Everyday, I walk by ditches piled with the dead bodies of my loved ones. The Janjaweed militiamen say they are ethnic cleansers but they are nothing more than murdering devils. I met this devil one day when I was out collecting firewood for my family. I tried to get back before the sun went down but I had to go further. As I'm walking back, I hear a truck behind me. I turn and I see it is Janjaweed militiamen, three of them. I know I'm in trouble. I dropped my firewood and try to run as fast as I can but my fast is not fast enough. Bang! Bang! Bang! They shoot at my feet. I stumble. I fall to my knees and onto my belly. One man says to me, "Where are you running you little cockroach?" I turn and cry immediately begging, pleading for them just to let me go. He strikes me at my face. My lip instantly swells. He turns to his two comrades and says, "We have another one." I laid there hoping to escape but there's no escaping the devil. One man points his gun and tells me if I move he will kill me. The others, they decide who's gonna take me first. I hear one man say, "You went first yesterday. It's my turn. It's my turn." My turn for what? 

00:28:25
[sil.] 

00:28:30
FATIMA They ripped the clothes off my body. They hold me down and the man leans in whispers, "Are you ready to become holy?" His breath smell like alcohol. The other man says, "Let's have some fun." They grabbed the beer bottle - 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
FATIMA - and they forced it into my 15-year-old womb. 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:20
FATIMA I cannot began to describe the pain, the embarrassment and the fear. Finally, the man takes it out and he enters me. I cry and I cry but there's no point. No one can hear me and even they did, they wouldn't stop them. This is now my new fate. Thrust after thrust I can feel the rocks cutting in the back. After the man is finished, the next man goes followed by the next. I'm numb, my entire body. All I can do is look at the stars and remember how I used to once enjoy them. When they're done, they urinate on me and tell me I should thank them, I should thank them for blessing me. I should be so lucky to have been with them. I'm left to walk home, a mile, broken body, drenched in semen, sweat, and my blood. I get home crying for my father. He takes one look at me and knows that I have suffered the fate of 10,000 girls just like me. My father doesn't accept me. In Sudan if a woman is raped or have sex before marriage they are regarded as unholy, not wanted and turned away by their family. I don't know what hurt more having my innocence stolen for me or my father not being there for me when I needed him the most. Now, I'm here in America, a refugee. My world is the same, I see the same sun, I see the same stars as I did that day but now I have a devil growing in me. I've had a devil in me for 3 months. My name is Fatima and this is my story. 

00:32:30
[sil.] 

00:32:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Fatima, while the Arab (inaudible ) were raping you, what was going through your mind? 

00:32:50
FATIMA I couldn't understand why someone would wanna do this to a little girl. Do they not have daughters? Do they not have sisters and mothers? What makes me so different from them? 

00:33:05
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Are you gonna keep your child? 

00:33:10
FATIMA How can I keep my child? How can I raise a devil? 

00:33:20
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG So you are thinking of giving him or her up for adoption? 

00:33:25
FATIMA Is there any other choice? 

00:33:25
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG You just say that you'll be given the child up for adoption. Any years later, he or she wanted and heard the birth mother are you gonna contact with the child? And the child ask you who was my father, what would you say to the child? 

00:33:50
[sil.] 

00:33:55
FATIMA I would tell the child they had no father. 

00:34:00
FRED BEMAK Fatima, can your life ever be the same? 

00:34:05
FATIMA My life will never be the same. My life ended the day they raped me. My life ended the day my dad didn't accept me as his daughter. 

00:34:15
FRED BEMAK And your dad he talks to you now, or he doesn't, he communicates with you or not? 

00:34:20
FATIMA No. 

00:34:20
FRED BEMAK So you've lost the dad. 

00:34:25
FATIMA The Janjaweed stole my father from me. 

00:34:30
FRED BEMAK Can you talk about this tape with anyone or is it private? 

00:34:40
[sil.] 

00:34:45
FATIMA Mentioning it just makes me relive it every detail, every breath, every sound, every scent just reminds me. I do not like talking about it. 

00:35:00
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG At one stage the UN said that there was no genocide in the Sudan, what is your reaction to that comment? 

00:35:10
FATIMA No genocide? How do you explain 300,000 people murdered? Isn't it any different from genocides in history? The justice in any foreign interest, is that why, is that why it's not a genocide? All I know is that I lost everything. 

00:35:35
FRED BEMAK What will happen Fatima with all the pain you have inside? 

00:35:45
FATIMA One day it would end me. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:55
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG What do you mean by that? 

00:35:55
FATIMA I don't know how I can live on like this. How can I ever love another man? How can I trust another man? I see what man can do. I see what my father did. How does one go about their life that way? How do I have a happy day? How do I enjoy sunset like everyone else when the sunset that I remember is the sunset that brought my rape. 

00:36:30
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG You're in the US now, do you feel safe? 

00:36:35
FATIMA I don't know what safe is. I don't feel anything. I'm numb. 

00:36:45
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Do you think you'll be able to heal from this at any time maybe the next 10, or 20, or 30 years? 

00:36:55
[sil.] 

00:37:00
FATIMA I thought that one time before but being pregnant is a constant reminder that I can have-- I cannot have a normal life. 

00:37:20
FRED BEMAK Unlike any other country in the world, the United States requires refugees like yourself to payback the plane fare. How was that affected you? 

00:37:35
FATIMA I can't understand how I have to pay for something when so much was stolen from me. I had nothing. I've received help but there's nothing that can help me. 

00:37:55
Laura 

00:38:00
LAURA My name is Laura and I'm proud to say I'm 85 years young and I look good too, don't I? Well, I've got a beautiful daughter named Sharon(ph) and a handsome son named James(ph). They've got their own families of their own now. They haven't got much time or a space for an old lady like myself. About 2 years ago, both of them came to me and insisted that I move in to Biscayne nursing home like a lot of people my age, I really had no say or no power in the no-- in the matter. I don't know where I went wrong as a mother. I raised my children with a value of family and they send me to a place where there's no family, no friends. Yeah, I was hurt but more than anything, it was the betrayal, the disappointment in myself as a mother. What did I do to make them wanna send me somewhere where I cannot see my grandchildren, I cannot bake cookies on a Sunday afternoon with them.

LAURA I mean, I guess the whole 2 years at Biscayne hasn't been horrible. I've made a few friends but it's not the same. I lived in my home for 55 years. I had a wonderful group of friends. A neighborhood that supported me. It was a home that I shared with my husband, God rest his soul. And now I don't even had those memories anymore. 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:10
LAURA At some point I did enjoy getting into the gossip around the nursing home about Mr. and Mrs. Pinelo(ph). I played a few games but in the last few months, I just can't really stand to be around anyone. I'm not sure what they're gonna say to me, what they're gonna do to me and to make it worse, I've heard the other residents asking, "What's wrong with Laura? She's so jittery when she's around everyone. She's so avoidant." The nurses say that I'm probably depressed because well, the truth is about 40 to 50% of residents at nursing homes they're depressed. But I'm not depressed, I just don't wanna be here. I wanna be with my daughter. I wanna be with all my grand kids. That's the life that I saw for myself. Let me just cut to the chase. Yesterday Sharon(ph) came and took me to the doctor about this cough that I've been having. None of the nurses have felt the need to check on me to see what's been going on. We get to the doctor and the doctor tells Sharon(ph) that I've been having walking pneumonia for quite some time now and even though that this could be severe for my age group, it will be okay. I can take antibiotics. But during the x-ray the doctor became really suspicious because every time that he tried to you know, touch me to set me up, I would jump back. And the process he noticed that here and between my thighs I had some dark spots and behind my shoulder I had some bruises. He called in a dermatologist who checked me out and told Sharon(ph) that more than likely I've been experiencing elder abuse. I'm so ashamed that my daughter had to find out. I'm so ashamed that anyone knows that someone had-- someone would do that to an old woman, why? For a while Sharon(ph) had a hard time, look at herself in the mirror, how could she have known? She could have known, there were ways to know. If, if you were gonna put me in a nursing home, why don't you go look for the facts to find out? Fifty percent of older people in nursing homes experienced elder abuse, verbal, and physical. Why didn't she go and look for the signs of elder abuse? They neglect the fact that she couldn't see me as often as she like or that I would have like to see her, the bruises, the dark spots. At this point, I'm just glad to be here, to still be here. This is a time that I can't reconnect with my family and now that I'm at the-- of this situation and I'm embarrassed. I don't want anyone to know. I'm ashamed. I'm disgusted that someone would do that to me, abuse an older woman. But thank God I'm still here, 85 years young, thank God. 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:05
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Laura, I'm sorry what happened to you but can you help understand cuz I'm little bit confused, were you raped or something like that? 

00:44:15
[sil.] 

00:44:20
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG You say yes. 

00:44:20
LAURA Yeah. 

00:44:20
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Uhm, you know, it's gonna hard for me to understand because I'm looking at you and you know, with all due respect, I mean, your, your old. Why would anyone rape an old person, I mean you know, you normally rape you know, young beautiful people. So I'm just you know. 

00:44:40
LAURA Why don't you tell me? 

00:44:40
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG I don't know. I'm so confused I mean, you know. 

00:44:45
LAURA I don't know either. All I can tell you is that it happened to me and I'll never know what somebody would want to do this to me. 

00:44:55
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG I supposed I don't really understand. I, I feel that maybe you're just making it up because you mentioned several times that you know, you wanna go home, you don't wanna be here. Are you just making these stories? I mean, you can tell us, I mean, it's just so difficult to believe that anyone would rape or physically or sexually abuse an old person? 

00:45:20
LAURA I'm not making it up and you could check the resources online and find out that this is happening to about 50% of older people. If I wanted to just go home I could have done it another way but why would I wanna experience the embarrassment in my community telling them that, ah, 85-year-old woman was sexually abused I'm gonna choose that. 

00:45:50
FRED BEMAK What, what hold you back Laura? You're getting raped. You didn't jump up and scream and say, "Help me and look what's going on?" Why didn't you tell anyone? 

00:46:05
LAURA And maybe that, uhm, I barely have enough power to get through the day. When someone who's younger than you, stronger than you, they have more control. They can cover your mouth so that you can't scream and I've been threatened that if I say anything that I wouldn't be able to get my food, I wouldn't eat. I really didn't feel like I have power. I couldn't say anything. I couldn't do anything. 

00:46:35
FRED BEMAK So you're powerless. You feel that. 

00:46:40
LAURA Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:40
FRED BEMAK Anyone else getting raped that you know about or its secret for everyone? 

00:46:45
LAURA It appears that it's been a secret for a long time for a few people and when my daughter went to the nursing home and press charges there were two other women who spoke out eventually you know. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:10
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG So what's gonna happen now? Are you gonna stay where you are? Will you be moving or? 

00:47:10
LAURA No. Thank God that I have a daughter that I have. She's taking me on immediately and her husband and, uhm, she have made space for me in their home but it's not the same for everyone. 

00:47:25
FRED BEMAK Yeah, what happens to the people that don't have a daughter to go home to? 

00:47:35
LAURA That's why Sharon(ph) now has taken it up to spread the word about this, uhm, to get the Elderly Protective Services involved so that we know how to deal with the situation because everyone is not as fortunate as me. 

00:47:50
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Okay. Laura, I, I supposed I'm, I'm you know, I'm not quite 85 and I was wondering what it's like to be 85? Can I just get you to close your eyes for a minute? Can you think back when you're in your 20s, like in your mid 20s. What was that, that like you know, I know that you were active and, uhm, or is running around doing stuff and, ah, have you got that picture in your mind - 

00:48:15
LAURA Uh-hmm. 

00:48:15
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG - what it's like to be, yeah, well. 

00:48:20
LAURA Yeah. 

00:48:20
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Can you describe a little bit about what it's like to be in your 20s? 

00:48:25
LAURA So long ago. 

00:48:25
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG I know it's so long ago, yeah. 

00:48:25
LAURA Uhm, very different. Uhm, people see you even when you're running people notice you. Uhm, people, they move out of your way when you need to get by. There's more power, when I want to eat, when I wanna watch TV, when I wanna walk I can. 

00:48:55
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Okay, what's it like now to be you know, open your eyes. What's it like now to be 85 in terms of physical, cognitively, emotionally, behaviorally? What's it like now? 

00:49:05
LAURA It's like, it's like going back to being a child especially being in a nursing home. Little choices to be made for myself. Want to eat? They tell me. Want to sleep? They tell me. I'm not able to get to-- get around the same way anymore. It's really-- it's, it's not an old woman's world. It's not made for me to be able to get around as easily to get where I have to go. And the people, people don't notice you. You would think that people will be more willing to help an old woman or help old woman but you'll be surprised. 

00:49:55
FRED BEMAK You're 85 Laura, you're depressed, you sound depressed to me. How can people like us help you? 

00:50:10
[sil.] 

00:50:15
LAURA Cope with depression? 

00:50:15
FRED BEMAK Uh-hmm. 

00:50:20
LAURA I don't know. I mean, my daughter she's, she's incredible she's-- she sort out some counseling for me and they've been helping me to kinda rebuild my sense of identity and my self-esteem at this age and helping me to feel a little bit more empower, it's hard but I think the biggest thing of all is just the reconnection with family. I wanna know that I have family who still cares about me. 

00:50:50
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG What, what are some of the myth about being old? 

00:50:55
LAURA That we can't make decisions for ourself. Uhm, we don't know what's going on. I've been there. I've done that I know what's happening. I have a lot to offer. I have a lot of wisdom. They think they've seen it alre-- they think they've seen it all, you know, I really seen it all. Oh, how they could benefit from hearing an older woman. 

00:51:20
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Anything else you like to tell people about aging? 

00:51:30
LAURA This-- it can be beautiful but I think that it's the most beautiful if our family and our loved ones believe that too. 

00:51:45
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Yeah, thank you. 

00:51:45
FRED BEMAK Thank you. 

00:51:50
Jamie 

00:51:55
JAMIE I just got off from my school counselors' office. I'm beyond words. I don't wanna talk, I don't wanna talk anymore. Why is everyone telling me that if I talk I'll feel better? You wanna hear about me? My name is Jamie White and as you can see the only White part of me is my last name. I was born in this same city 17 years ago. Wow, 17 years ago it feels like a long time but it isn't everything is the same, same all, same all, same crimes, same homeless people. Maybe a lot more people getting kicked out of their apartments because they cannot afford the rent. My family, yeah, I have a mom and a sister, Ayesha(ph), she's beautiful, the best dancer. She was placed in special ed last year. My mom is really worried. In her last PTA meeting they said that a lot of Black kids and-- are just way more in those classes than anything else. I don't see anything wrong with her. I haven't had that problem I'm actually good, I'm a good student. Teachers seem to like me. I got a lot of pats in the back and, "Keep the good job Jamie, you're doing good." I got above average in reading but don't get too excited only 30% of Black kids in my school got it compared to 84 of White ones. That's not fair, that's not fair game people, come on. I used to have dreams, yeah, you think that I wanna live from public benefits? No. Yeah, I wish I could have opportunities to go to college and do what other kids do but let's be honest I cannot even (inaudible ) my application to college because I didn't get their classes. I don't know how to do that instead of teachers coming and telling me, "Oh, Jamie if only you." If only I do what? If only I was born in the other part of the city? If only I was whiter or if I was less poor? If only my mom have-- my mom had more money on her bank account my destiny would be different? I know what you're thinking. You think I should be thankful? You think I should be thankful for a free occasion? No. I'm not. I got a free lunch that's not the same as having AP classes that the other school around the corner has. They have 20, 23 classes to choose from. You know how many classes in my school we have, AP classes? Three. The building is tearing down. Teachers don't even stay a year with us. They don't wanna teach us, they're tired. I'm tired. My mom is tired. She works two jobs. It's hard to be a single mom. It's really hard. She didn't finish high school. She dropped out of college, the school. She dropped out of school after she got pregnant of me. Same all, same all, same thing in school. Highest dropout rates. Highest teen pregnancy rates. Yeah, I heard the other day, 60% of teen pregnancies are from Latinas and Black girls. What's going on? What's now-- why not (inaudible ). Why is it they're not doing anything else? Why? I kept so many questions. I wish I could do something about it but maybe I should just start listening to my friends. Maybe I should just got a job. Get real Jamie, got a job. I guess that's my destiny. I guess that's how luck I will get if I just finish high school and help my mom pay the bills. But just what I was dreaming of, well, maybe dreams are not for Blacks. Maybe dreams are for those who have money. Maybe dreams are for those who can afford to dream. Yeah, maybe, maybe some days I wish I could be part of the solution. Yeah, some days I wish that I could do things differently that I could be a teacher that can encourage kids instead of just seeing them falling through the cracks. Well, you know why let's be real. Only one out of seven kids Black kids go to college and finish college and less than 1% get a PhD. You can start, start seeing where I'm coming from. Even if I wanna get a job, listen to this. I heard the other day, it's easier if you're White with a criminal background to get a job that a black man with criminal records. It is you get more pay if you're a White person with a high school diploma than as Black person with an advance degree. Think about it woman. I wish I could live in a world when my destiny is now determined by the color of my skin or how poor or how rich I am. Yeah, some days I wish I could be part of that. Today? I feel like nothing. 

00:57:30
[sil.] 

00:57:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Jamie, so that I can understand where you're coming from, can you describe the conditions of your school? 

00:57:45
JAMIE Ah, it's an old building. There are some teacher that have been there forever but they're tired, they keep talking about low salaries and there's you know, sometimes we have to share materials. We don't have computers in every classroom like others like iPods and fancy stuff that other schools have. We just have you know, AC broke down the other day. The heater doesn't work. It's just nasty, it's nasty. 

00:58:15
FRED BEMAK What do your friends into Jamie? 

00:58:20
JAMIE They're mad at me. They think that I want to be White. They think that I'm like them. They feel that I'm betraying them. Uhm, you know, it's easier for me to just go and hangout with the bad guys but I actually wanted to do better. And I don't think it bad. I think that you know, they just-- we don't have any options. 

00:58:40
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Oh, what does it mean to be White or acting White? 

00:58:45
JAMIE Being good at school, wanting to get to the better classes, wanting to do well, not getting trouble as-- I guess that others do. 

00:58:55
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG You-- you're a bright kid and you wanted to go to college, right and that's not happening. 

00:59:05
JAMIE It's not, it's not. I-- that's now gonna get me there just high-five and you're good. Look at this, I mean, even if I'm bright here that doesn't mean anything. Eighty percent of White kids are doing the same thing, ah, as I am and they can afford getting better, uhm, preparation to get those SATs right and to get someone who sit with them and do the college essays and do the application. I don't even have money for, for that. 

00:59:40
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG So what's gonna happen to you? You're not going college. You're gonna graduate in next couple of months. What gonna happen to you? 

00:59:50
JAMIE I should listen to what you know, my guys are saying to get a job, just get the minimum wage and help pay the bills. 

01:00:00
FRED BEMAK Where's, where's your dad? Is he around guiding you about college or things like that? 

01:00:05
JAMIE He's not, he's not in the picture. He has never been. 

01:00:10
FRED BEMAK So you don't have any guidance about college? 

01:00:15
JAMIE No, my mom doesn't-- she has good intention. She's working hard but she's tired. 

01:00:20
FRED BEMAK And your school counselor? 

01:00:25
JAMIE She's really nice lady. She puts a pity face every time I see her and that you're good, you're smart, you're bright. That doesn't take me anywhere. 

01:00:35
FRED BEMAK Hmm. 

01:00:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Where do you see yourself doing in the next 10 years or 15 years? 

01:00:40
JAMIE I don't wanna think about it. I don't wanna live like that. 

01:00:45
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Live like what? 

01:00:45
JAMIE Like not going anywhere. I don't wanna live of food stamps and public benefits. I don't wanna live the same thing that my mom is been living forever. I'm tired of it. 

01:01:00
FRED BEMAK Not having a future? What is that doing to you? 

01:01:10
JAMIE It's killing me. I don't wanna do it. It sucks. I'm pissed. I don't wanna do it anymore. It's not fair. It's not what I wanted to do. It's not what I want my sister to do. It's not fair. 

01:01:25
FRED BEMAK So there's a huge gap between what you want to do and what you can do, is that what you're saying? 

01:01:35
JAMIE I'm so tired of hearing that. "You can do it. You're good." Well, show me how to. I don't have the same as others do. I'm tired of hearing that if I work a little bit more I'll get to it that there's scholarships out there. Show me where. Give me those. I cannot do it myself. 

01:02:00
[sil.] 

01:02:05
FRED BEMAK I want to thank everyone for coming today and participating in making this movie. Well, we want to start by having everybody take their characters' clothing off so you can see them for who they are. 

01:02:20
[sil.] 

01:02:30
FRED BEMAK Everyone here is a graduate or a graduate students in the Counseling and Development Program at George Mason University. We have PhD students and master's degree students. 

01:02:45
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG I like to introduce Amy Gleason Carroll. Although Amy did not present her character in the video, she has done this in class. I thought it would be interesting for you to hear Amy's character and I will gonna ask Amy to briefly summarize her character and join in the debriefing of these character's presentations. 

01:03:05
AMY GLEASON CARROLL Ah, my character was Miguel(ph), a 14-year-old Cuban immigrant to the United States who had been in the country about a year, uhm, and was separated from his parents, uhm, for 8 years living in Cuba. Came to the United States about a year ago to find that his father was no longer with the family. He had a new stepfather and a stepbrother. 

01:03:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Thank you Amy. I think we can now begin and get your reaction in terms of your portrayal of the character presentation. 

01:03:40
Diana Ortiz 

01:03:45
DIANA ORTIZ I can go first. I had so much, uhm, energy putting to this character and although my initial first, uhm, time when I did it in the class was a few years ago. Uhm, Jamie White is still part of who, uhm, who I am as professional and how I, uhm, how I carry this into every, every single child that I see in my practice, how I understand, ah, how ingrained this, uhm, issues are in our society and more, more recently how I want my child to be in a world where it's fair and is a world where he has the same opportunities as everyone else. 

01:04:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Ah, thank you Diana. 

01:04:35
FRED BEMAK Who else has reaction to how this experience was for you? 

01:04:40
Ricshawn Roane 

01:04:45
RICSHAWN ROANE Well, uhm, when I first read my character, Dr. Chung assigned the characters as the mother of a 12-year-old son, uhm, who died of untreated dental caries. I thought I had recently had a child and I thought this will be impossible to do. Uhm, and the more I researched and realized the reality that, that situation is for so many people. Uhm, there's so much information, misinformation about a being low income and services that are available to you. Uhm, and I thought that I was pretty open-minded and enlightened about things but the characters and of the characters are all my classmates really open my mind to so many situations that I just wasn't aware of. 

01:05:35
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Thank you Ricshawn. 

01:05:35
Luis Sosa 

01:05:35
LUIS SOSA For me it was, ah, great eye opener. Uhm, when I got my topic, my character I was thinking you know, how can I relate to a 15-year-old you know, rape victim from Sudan. You know, at the time I was-- I believe was about 29 years old, Latino male so I can I relate like am I really gonna feel the-- like you know, the power behind this assignment and, and doing the research and is reading the statistics. You know, getting online, looking at pictures, reading stories, it just, it just hit you. And, uhm, you re ally do take on that character. Uhm, I, I did really feel like I was you know, Fatima and, uhm, and, and just listening to my classmates in their presentations. You, you grow a great respect for how important you know, are the stories and how, how powerful they are and what we're gonna be facing in the field. Uhm, it was very humbling, very scary all at the same time. And I'm just-- you just know that there's-- you, you never really know everything because there's so many different scenarios you know, stories out there. And to just hear everything, it didn't pull it together. It was, ah, very powerful for me. 

01:06:50
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Thanks Luis. 

01:06:50
Kara 'Anese' Irick 

01:06:55
KARA 'ANESE' IRICK Uhm, initially I was really challenged by this character. It was about maybe 63 years in between my age and my character's age. And my grandparents and my great grandparents lived very far from me so it was hard for me to connect to them. But again as everyone said once we start that research and you really start connecting to the character you find that it becomes a part of you and a part of who you will be in the field when we get out there. Uhm, for me I imagine that I would never work with the elderly population at all and now I find myself hoping that I could have an impact to help out a group that di-- disempowered in our society and a lot of times forgotten even by the people that care about them. 

01:07:50
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Thanks Anese. 

01:07:55
AMY GLEASON CARROLL Uhm, in researching my character, I read not only about the waves of Cuban immigrants but spread that out to others waves of Latino immigrants. And not only the statistics but the stories of, uhm, those immigrants and began to open my eyes to, uhm, my children's classmates who are, uhm, other Latino immigrants and also open my eyes to how I could grow as a social justice, uhm, multicultural counselor, uhm, to find areas where I've had bias. Uhm, before this, I've entered the master's program. I had spoken against the Day Labor site on my street because I felt like I didn't want strange men walking through my neighborhood. Well, in researching and becoming connected to the stories of Latino immigrants I recognized, uhm, that those men walking on my street had faced tremendous hardships and were often, uhm, taken advantage of by employers and that the Day Labor Center it was one of the few things we could do to serve them and was frankly ashamed of, uhm, speaking out against it. Uhm, and so now I make a concerted effort to reach out to parents of my, uhm, children's friends who are Latino and, uhm, bridge the gap between my knowledge of the school system and there are some just other ways that I appreciate not only Latino immigrants but other people who have been disenfranchised in our country. 

01:09:30
FRED BEMAK The, the way you're touched by the story, is that similar for others where you're touched by the character that you were assigned and that you brought to life or not if you could share that, that might helpful if you were. 

01:09:45
RICSHAWN ROANE Well, I would definitely say, uhm, that I have been touched with my character. I think, uhm, just becoming an advocate for health care in the broader sense because as my character said it is so true that so many people want all types of health care in health care. But you can have health care and not have dental care. Uhm, and as more and more people are educated about that, uhm, I find the people are shocked, that people can't understand how this happens in a quote unquote, "First World industrialized country" that we have children who die because of untreated dental cavities. Uhm, and so it's, it's become very personal for, for me, uhm, speaking in the community about the need for free dental services. 

01:10:35
KARA 'ANESE' IRICK Yeah, so this, ah, it made me think of my great grandmother who is elderly and needs a lot of assistance. And right now she's able to be taken care of by my grandmother who's also up there an age but she somehow is able to get over to my great grandmother and take care of her. But what if something happens to her? Who was going to be able to take care of either one of them and with us being so far away? What if our only choice was to put one of them in a nursing home? And so it made me think about how we would have to educate ourselves about what does elderly abuse look like? What was the resources-- what resources we could use to help prevent it so that we could recognize it because really you may, you may not have a choice. Yup. 

01:11:25
FRED BEMAK What is the experience of walking in someone shoes which happens with this character? And then you run into people who have an experience walking in other shoes. How do you manage that when you're talking to others in your world? 

01:11:45
LUIS SOSA For, for me when I am walking in shoes of my character, ah, you know, I selfishly felt grateful that I've-- I haven't experience that. Uhm, just the, the gravity of, of everything that you know, my character went through. Uhm, and also for I'm a student-- I'm a school counselor now and that I have several students that I know take their community for granted and that it's, it's very frustrating to know that you know, to hear these stories and to know that in-- the world is, is outside their, their bubble what they think is their, their world. And, uhm, so when I'm working with my students that haven't been experience some of these adversities that our characters have, uhm, you know, I remind myself that they don't know but I also encourage them to, to expand their, their thoughts and their views and con-- construct the worldview that encompasses everything. 

01:12:45
FRED BEMAK Great. 

01:12:45
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Uh-hmm. 

01:12:50
RICSHAWN ROANE As-- you know, I, I think for me, uhm, to be completely honest when I first learn about this character, I was probably pretty hard on everyone around me that didn't have the knowledge. Uhm, and expecting them to come up to speed as quickly as I did and to know and I-- we get frustrated when people had never heard of you know, the children not having dental insurance. Uhm, and overtime I learned they didn't all had this experience and so sometimes you have to make baby steps and give the information a little at a time and not hold people accountable for not knowing. But now that we know, we can share information but initially that was very hard and, uhm, I was hard on people who didn't know. 

01:13:40
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG So from what you all been saying, is it fair to say that the, uhm, Ethnographic assignment has given you awareness of critical consciousness of not only your characters but your, ah, classmates character social injustices situation, yeah, good. And has that move from that critical awareness, how that move from action or proactive, uhm, advocacy? 

01:14:05
AMY GLEASON CARROLL I think for me I, uhm, I was moved deeply by it emotionally and that translates to telling everyone I know about all this new information I have and trying to convince them to, uhm, understand the lives of others. I talk about like the radical empathy that I gained in doing this character because you think as counselor you care for other people, uhm, but through this character and this experience I did a inventory of all the ways that I have, uhm, not been completely empathetic to, uhm, those I, I encounter in my life and those who might be my, uhm, counselees. So it was very helpful in that way. I think just educating and talking to friends, family, neighbors, school administrators, everyone, yeah. 

01:14:55
KARA 'ANESE' IRICK Yeah, I agree, uhm, after participating in this I find myself more ready to confront my family members or friends when they are ready to label someone or not consider the background story, uhm, to the person in front of their face. Uhm, in front of the stereotypes that we are conditioned to, to think about. So now, I'm just like think about what happened before, before they got here. And I think that the fact that we kinda walk through these steps and we've heard other stories, ah, in the same manner it helps us to, to help, to help the people close to was connect emotionally, uhm, to the circumstance. So was now-- we're now limited to conveying the stories as to statistics anymore. It's about the human experience that goes behind these characters and I think that's what I gain the most especially when I want to spread the same knowledge, yeah. 

01:16:05
FRED BEMAK Each of you is sharing you experience with this assignment about a character who's experience social injustice. And yet it is a classroom assignment for all you and all your peers in the graduate level class. Can you talk about the impact on the cla-- the full class and what happens beca-- because some people watching this might say, "Oh, you had an experience." But there are numbers of people you've sat in the classroom with, can you comment on what it's like for an entire class to go to what we've been sharing here today? 

01:16:50
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG And, and also, uhm, I think all of you were in class of size of 20. So we had 20 different social injustices and represents the inter-- throughout the whole day, ah, all day Saturday from 9 to 5.

01:17:10
RICSHAWN ROANE So, for I think me, me and my classmates if you can just imagine the four characters you heard today but hearing 20 of those all with a different set of situations and issues being so accurately and vividly portrayed that for that 5, 8 minutes you're there for whatever the character is. Emotionally, at the end of that you're just so raw and just so, so open. You feel like your eyes have been open to things you knew existed but you never really knew existed. And you begin to see your classmates differently because instead of just Amy that you had XYZ class before, that's Amy who portrayed this character so well. Uhm, and you can have different conversations then with your classmates. It's almost like it opens a door to a level of conversation and connection that you cannot have before becoming these people I think. 

01:18:20
FRED BEMAK Thank you. Other comments about this. 

01:18:25
DIANA ORTIZ I would just add that after the emotional draining that it takes for a very long day been exposed to so many stories, there is a lot of respect and admiration for you know, classmates, fellow classmates. And, uhm, it's really nice to know that they're gonna be out in the field too. So it's not just me alone in the world trying to change things but it's a group multiplying about others that have the same knowledge and passion to do something about it. 

01:19:00
KARA 'ANESE' IRICK The room is, uhm, full of emotion. It's very intense and it's not just coming from you. You can feel it from all other 19 people it-- in the classroom with you. And one thing that really stock out to me was because it was a long day, because you had to hear these stories over and over again and it made me think about what it's like to really be counselor. And to hear these stories and it may drain you but this is their reality and you signed up to advocate for these people. So you just can't walk away. You can't just say it's too much to bear, it's too much to think about. And if they can bear these real-life experiences then I can bear to, to really hear this and internalize this experience. And it made me think about the strength that, that I'm capable of when I am working as a counselor. 

01:19:55
FRED BEMAK Thank you Anese. Any-- anything to add? 

01:19:55
AMY GLEASON CARROLL Just during the breaks, uhm, in the class and for days afterwards, I remember classmates are running up to each other asking more about the character, more about what they learned, because it really insights this passion as we've talked about in finding out more about these injustices. Uhm, so I found that very interesting that we all are sources of information for each other and ignite that passion for research and service in each other. 

01:20:25
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG A-- and just so that the viewers of the video know, ah, we don't just to really leave the students hanging with this emo-- emotion. Another portion of the assignment is to do a social action plan and advocacy pa-- plan for the character's situation. Okay, thank you very much - 

01:20:40
FRED BEMAK All of you. 

01:20:40
RITA CHI-YING CHUNG - all of you, thank you, yeah.
