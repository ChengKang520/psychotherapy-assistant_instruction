DAVID HOOKER When you think historical trauma, there are two dimensions to it, really. There's trauma that, has arisen over an extended period, and there's also historical trauma in the sense that it has impacted entire cultures or entire communities, in ways that they then shift in their being. And, when I think of trauma, I try to make a distinction between what is in fact, trauma, and what was the trauma genesis, or the genesis of trauma. And so, a circumstance is trauma-genic, when, it overwhelms either an individual or a community's collective capacity to respond. There's a threat, there's a sense of threat. And their capacity to respond is overwhelmed, and then trauma becomes the way that they perform the overwhelm. And so for some, trauma looks like depression. For some, trauma looks like anger, or violence, for some, trauma looks like isolation, and yet each of those is a performance of the experience of trauma. And some, out of that same trauma-genic circumstance, may in fact not have been overwhelmed, and so they would not perform, they would not demonstrate. They would not show what we will call 'trauma'.

"History itself is not wounded" 

00:02:07
[sil.] 

00:02:12
DAVID HOOKER I often say that history itself is not wounded, while some would say we're seeking to heal a wounded history. It's not the history itself that's wounded, the history just is. What happens is there are circumstances, and then there's meaning made from them, and there are responses to historical circumstances, that are isolating, that are debilitating, that are, in fact, in other ways, trauma responses to a historic circumstance, but deep inside of any historic event, there are also the experiences of triumph, the experience of, uh, witness the ex-, there are so many other experiences, and so the history itself is not, in fact, traumatized. The history itself is not, in fact, wounded. It is our response to it, and the response that gets brought forward generation after generation even when the trauma-genic circumstances themselves are no longer in effect. So we need not heal history. We need to draw from history as a part of the place where we go as we are seeking to heal ourselves, our relationships, our wounded experience, and even the structures that we have constructed out of those trauma-genic circumstances. 

00:03:27
Legacy and Aftermath 

00:03:32
[sil.] 

00:03:32
"Legacy" refers to the stories, mythology, prejudices, old folk wisdom and other practices that transmit the "lessons/meaning" of the experience to another group or another generation. 

00:03:32
"Aftermath" are the structural and organizational remnants that exist in society. 

00:03:32
These were originally instituted or constructed to either reinforce or teach a particular component of the legacy. 

00:03:57
DAVID HOOKER In order to fully understand how trauma performance, or how trauma responses get carried forward year after year, generation after generation, particularly for individuals in communities that themselves are not experiencing the trauma-genic circumstance, we've identified two concepts, legacy and aftermath, and, when we think about legacy, we're thinking about the history, the folklores, the mythology, the lies, the biases, and the productive witness, but all of the words that get passed down from generation to generation. Because inside of those stories, and the mythology, and the folklore, there are also values and principles and there are also parts of individuals' vision, and so the-, the-, and community vision, so the mythology, the history, give a sense of what the possibility horizon is. And that's connected to this concept of aftermath. When you think about aftermath, you think about the structural debris, the, broken houses, the broken streets, and so forth, that result from a major upheaval, like you think about nine-11, or Katrina, or something like this where there is, there are buildings that are broken down, there are things that are crushed and crumbled, and what happens in the repair process is that, much of it is swept away, or removed, but then there's some that gets pulverized, it gets reconstructed, it gets built into the foundation of existence. Those same kinds of structures were in place to create trauma-genic circumstances, and to perpetuate them, and so policies, laws, practices that created isolation, that created marginalization, those policies and practices, some of them get swept away when the afterma-, when the legacy is no longer viable. When people discredit the legacy, some of those policies and practices get swept away, but others remain, and they get built into the structure, they're almost like artwork in the sense that they become part of our ongoing way of thinking, and people no longer consider that they were made up, or that they were created in order to perpetuate marginalization. Often, the legacy has no basis, and when it's easily discredited, the structures themselves would no longer make sense. But if you're seeking to undo the historical trauma, or the transmission of historical trauma, you have to address both the legacy and the structures that it created, because if you just take away the structures and the values continue to exist, the beliefs continue to exist, we as human beings will create structures to support our values. If, in fact, you discredit the values, undo the legacy, lift a new history, but the structures themselves stay in place, then what happens is the structures will continue to reproduce, so that then people might go back and believe that those previously discredited values were, in fact, true. So you have to address both legacy and aftermath as you think about how to address historical trauma. One example of the effect and the way that legacy and aftermath are connected, in the United States, we can take a look at the period immediately after the Emancipation Proclamation in the United States. Where, there had been millions of Africans who had been enslaved, and at the point of their emancipation, fully 70 percent Douglass Blackmen, in his book 'Slavery by Another Name' reports that m-, fully 70 percent of all industry in the South was built on an economic model of uncompensated labor. In order for the South not to completely collapse as a result of the emancipation, there needed to be laws and policies and practices put in place that created access to uncompensated labor. That became the convict leasing system, and so freedom-seeking activities that previously would have just been acceptable, were now criminalized in ways that allowed the local sheriffs to arrest Africans, African men who had recently been, uh, freed, and then set them to hard labor, so they could provide that labor, uh, to those industries that needed uncompensated labor. In order to make that system even make sense, and for it to be able to continue, from 1867 to 1945, when it was finally outlawed, there were, there's legacy, there are lies and myths that were told about the nature of the black man with regard to their criminality, with regard to their aggressiveness, with regard to their laziness. This is the thing about legacy, the lies don't actually have to line up, they don't have to actually hold true and be consistent, it's just you have to tell something in order to support those structures that we've created, and so there were policies that were created that constructed a world in which fully half, at the time, of the African American men, in, of labor age, in the United States, were incarcerated. Were under the control of a local sheriff. One interesting ac-, architectural feature, if you look at some of the industry where they really relied on uncompensated labor, if you look at the slos (ph) furnaces, or the iron furnaces, throughout Alabama and Mississippi. Or if you look at the brick-works factory in Atlanta, Georgia, what you will notice is that there is a cemetery that sits around it. And that's because when the labor was owned, the ownership had an investment in it. But the owners-, once they were leased, they no longer had an investment in the productivity and the survival of the labor, so they would literally work them to death, bury them on the grounds of the furnaces, and the brick-works, and then they'd go back to work. And so you have both architectural markers of this legacy and aftermath. If the legacy has disappeared, and so, in many quarters, in many progressive quarters, we recognize that African American men, African Americans generally are not more prone to criminality, and yet, because those structures remained in place, they tend to be policed more heavily, which now means they get imprisoned more often. And so, even when the legacy is discredited, the structures continue to recreate a circumstance such that even now, in 2012, 45 percent of African American men remain under the control of the prison industrial complex here in these United States, and so that is a continuing structural and legacy action that is continuing to produce and reproduce a trauma-genic circumstance. It is the perpetuation of a historical trauma, and because it is so ubiquitous in the world, most of us don't notice it, and so we don't react against it, it's just part of the milieu of America. We accept it. Legacy and aftermath get pulverized, they become part of the artwork, they become part of the foundation, and the historical trauma is perpetuated for generation after generation.

"Trauma that is not transformed will be transferred" 

00:11:32
Richard Rohr 

00:11:42
DAVID HOOKER There is an expression that says 'hurt people hurt people'. And, what happens is when someone has been traumatized, or when someone has experienced a trauma-genic circumstance, much of the response to trauma is either in acting in against yourself, or in acting out against others. So often, people who have been traumatized, who are either angry or uh, despondent, or in some other way experiencing marginalization, or some level of oppression, will either act in against themselves, and we see that in things, uh, sometimes it's something like a clinical depression, or, uh, substance abuse, or in some other way, harming yourself, and sometimes it is a violence, or a isolation, or something else where they're impacting the people that are around them. In, when entire communities, or entire cultures, have been harmed, or have gone together through trauma-genic circumstances, often, there are responses that become normalized responses. There are responses that become part of the way that we relate to one another. The folks who are actually going through the trauma-genic circumstance develop what are sometimes reasonable responses to the trauma-genic circumstance. The younger children may, in fact, not understand why those behaviors exist, they just mimic the behavior, and so even when the trauma-genic circumstance is no longer present, the behavior itself is still present. An example that I really appreciate is an example, uh, that comes from Joy Leary, in her books, uh, 'Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome', and she describes the process in which families, during the enslavement period, were often ripped apart. Children were taken from their parents, and primarily the children who were more likely to be taken were the children who were beautiful, the children who were smart, the children who were talented. And so, when an overseer, or a master would come to the parent, and, admire their child, they would say, 'Oh, that one's a beautiful child, that one looks really strong, that one is very smart,' the parent in a defensive mode, would say, that child ain't worth nothin', that child is not smart, that child is ugly, leave 'em alone. And it was a defensive model. The children don't necessarily recognize the danger that's present in, when they're being complimented, in that circumstance. And so they recognize that a loving parent would critique them in ways that suggested that they were less of, of less value. Generation after generation, then that can become a parenting model, because someone who loves you, criticized you, someone who loved you would say, that child ain't gonna amount to nothin', that child is not very smart, she is really not very pretty, and it was, at, in its original context, it was a protective action, but over the generations, it would get passed down as a parenting model, where the practices continue even when the trauma-genic circumstance that created the context for its necessity has been removed. This same question, or this same statement, 'hurt people hurt people', is said in another way, Richard Rohr says that 'Trauma this is not transformed, will be transferred.' Which means if it's not healed within the individual, if it's not healed within the culture or the community, that in some way it will be transferred to others either from the watching and witnessing of internal harm-producing behavior, or from the external harm, and the violence that is done and so this is why you can see a cyclical nature of violence, where someone who is leaving the oppression and the religious oppression of Europe at the time, did not even recognize their continuing oppression when they would come to the United States, and displace the first nation's folks who were here, and so there it becomes a circle, a cycle of victim-hood and violence that comes from that trauma that is not healed, being transferred to the next. 'Many of us,' father Michael Lapsly (ph) from South Africa says that, 'Many of us will recognize when we are oppressed, but very few notice when we are acting as oppressor.' And so, the trauma that we are transferring just becomes a natural response. A way of being. In societies, what often happens is, and there's tremendous research coming around this right now, which suggests that your mind can't distinguish between the periods when you are being victimized, the periods when you are being victimized, and the periods when you are by standing and watching. In each of those circumstances, we recognize harm being done, and as victim, as victimizer, as bystander, in each of those ways, we can experience that situation as trauma-genic. It can produce trauma. Now we perform it very differently. Victims may perform trauma anger, depression, isolation. But those who are victimizers, in order to justify their behavior, demonstrate their trauma-genic results. Or they perform their trauma through things like a lack of empathy, through things like, uh, denial of circumstances. Through creating barriers and structures so that they don't have to see the results of the circumstances that they've created. And so in addition to the legacy, the lies, the myths, the folklore that's being told, they also create structures that separate themselves so that they can live in a denial. And bystanders will often also live in a denial. And so one of the hallmarks of a traumatized community, this was witnessed through Native Americans, through African Americans, through the Jewish Holocaust, it was also similar in the Japanese internment, is a silence. There is an unmentioning. So that those who both witnessed, and those who experienced do not tell, so that they can deny the existence of the trauma itself. That silencing and not noticing, the structures that have been created, allows the trauma-genic circumstances to continue, and allows the structures themselves to stay in place so that entire societies, whether victim, victimizer, bystander will all be impacted, and then there will be policies and practices, and relational norms that are all part of the ongoing circumstance. It just becomes the milieu of a community. We say, 'It's just how we do things. We don't mix races. We don't live together. They wanna live by themselves, and so we create financial models that will isolate, and then we suggest that it's because the mythology that we really don't want to live together. That we're different people. That we wanna operate separately. We create housing practices, educational practices, to teach a different history, to live in different communities, so that we don't have to share and experience, and in not sharing those experiences, we also have a less likelihood of hearing the pain and the circumstance, or the expression and the experience of others who may be experiencing the same set of trauma-genic circumstances from a different perspective. 

00:19:42
Healing Communities 

00:19:47
[sil.] 

00:19:52
DAVID HOOKER Often it's the case that entire societies, entire communities are traumatized. There's a, a model of of looking at this and understanding how it works that's very helpful. Maury Doogan (ph) has what's called a nested model of conflict. And in the nested model of conflict, if you think about a series of the Russian nested dolls, individuals families, communities, regions, nations, internationally, there may be a trauma-genic circumstance that happens that then gets filtered through each of those layers. And, at the individual level, traumatizing circumstances that happen at the individual level will impact the way that families organize themselves. Which will, in some small or large way, impact the way that communities are organized, which impacts at every other level, and so when you're thinking about the sources of trauma, you have to notice that there is a context. There's an international, there's a national, there's a regional, there's a local, there's a family, there's an individual context, and in all of those ways, entire communities can become traumatized, but remembering that being overwhelmed, the experience of being overwhelmed, doesn't predict or determine what the response is going to be. And so sometimes, in the overwhelm, you recognize that people will draw strength from that. They will become more focused, they will become more faithful, they will become more resilient, they will become more creative in their response. And so, often, creating responses are responses to the same overwhelm that others might experience as debilitating, and yet in a community, an entire community may not necessarily recognize that all the of these different dimensions are, in fact, performances of the same overwhelm. One of the best things that one of the most exciting aspects of this is that innate in every being is the desire to heal. Innate in every community is the desire to fully reclaim its place, its full set of ag-, its full sense of agency, and so because that can be tapped, we look for ways of tapping into that innate continuing commitment to be fully self-expressed, and be fully actualized both as individuals and as a group. And among the ways that we do that, is by creating counter-stories. Often legacy, the debilitating and marginalizing aspect of legacy, become the dominant narrative in a community. And so in order to address that, we have to go back in history, and understand how to create the counter-stories. Where was the survival. Where were the gifts, the graces that were developed in response to these overwhelming circumstances. Where have we, as a community, come together and demonstrated our loving capacity. And so you begin to tell a counter-story to the dominant narrative. Connecting is also very important because part of drawing strength is, in addition to his-, history, we draw strength from connecting to others. Both those who've had the same circumstances, and those who are not aware of the circumstances, because through creative exchange, through understanding and representing and appreciating the humanity in one another, we can, in fact, draw the strength that produces a new narrative. Not a narrative of isolation, not a narrative of marginalization, but a narrative of equity, of shared commitment, of shared sacrifice, and a narrative of a positive possibility going forward. And so, we unveil history, we make connections, and then we take actions together in ways that will allow us to shift policies, structures, relationships, that were previously defined by marginalizing, legacy-based narrative, so that we can give demonstration that, that's not all there is, that there is something new that's possible. That there is a greater world that is, in fact, possible, where everybody has full, fundamentally, full access to the resources and opportunities that they need for actualization, and expression, and so healing, even from trauma that has happened, and been passed through multiple generations, is still possible, and present, even today. And that's why the work is still yet to be done, and it's worth taking a look, understanding our history, making connections, healing as individuals and communities, and taking action so that the multi-generation transmission of trauma can either be mitigated, or completely eliminated as we go forth into a new space together.

00:25:17
DAVID HOOKER So, one of the things that I remember was when we began working together again, uh, when we were in the neighborhood planning unit, V, and I was trying to do a community level look at how to organize people around issues of restorative justice, and of trauma healing, and arts, and spirituality, and how we had the opportunity to begin working together, and you were bringing in the notions of power-wounding, and fiscal trauma and how important that was to the- 

00:25:52
VANESSA JACKSON Right. 

00:25:52
DAVID HOOKER So I'm glad we're having a chance to talk about this again today. 

00:25:57
VANESSA JACKSON Yes. 

00:25:57
DAVID HOOKER Um, I'm glad you're here, so um, remind me, 'cause I, there's a place that I want to start from where you talk about power-wounding- 

00:26:02
VANESSA JACKSON Right. 

00:26:07
DAVID HOOKER And I wanna begin-, I wanna go back to that, and if you could help me again identifying power, and then power-wounding, 'cause then I have some questions about how we expand that to incorporate the notions of historical harm in that. 

00:26:17
VANESSA JACKSON All right, good, the way that I think about power is that ability to have an impact on your environment. In your life choices, it's the ability to influence uh, your life choices, but also your relationship with other people. And it's that individual sense of mastery, so there's sorta three levels of power, the way that I always think about it. It's power, over, that which we tend to see rather negatively, although there's a really positive aspects of power. Power's kinda neutral, quite frankly. Uh, but that sorta-, we see force and that kinda stuff. That's the way we generally think about power over-, but that's that larger way of my ability to control-, impact my life circumstances. There's power with, which is that collaborative thing, it's about the use of relationship, and influence, that we all have to-, we all have, and so, some people are co-, more conscious how they use it, and then power from within is that part where it doesn't matter what's goin' on in your life, and, especially in NPUV, I think, was some really powerful examples of these conditions that have been building up over years. The legacy, and the aftermath of, enslavement, and then power sh-, of black people, and that there were still people who would say, there's semethin' in me that I know has great value, no one else believes I have that value. And I remember someone talking about when, as they moved the elders out, that we have lost our wisdom. And that, not only did she recognize her own power and sacredness, is that she understood that there was a gift in the community, and, so that's how all these different ways of power work. 

00:27:52
DAVID HOOKER So, the, thing that I wanted to, look at, around power, because there's a-, there's another level of it that I'm interested in, your take on. When I think about the impact of legacy and aftermath, what I know is, or what I imagine to be case is, that, the possibility horizon that people operate in. Like what they even see as possible. Is limited and constrained often by kind of a continuation of historical circumstances and the mythology that gets passed down from time to time. And so, would you consider it power if somebody is operating in a limited horizon, now they have the capacity within what they see as possible. To make action, how do you, I'm not sure that I would understand that to be operating in their full power, and so how do you think about that. 

00:28:47
VANESSA JACKSON Well, they're not operating their full power, but in that start to talk about this thing that I talk about is power-wounding, or power constrictions. That the possibilities are there to take different actions whether individually, or collectively, but there has been, because of the trauma, uh, and the reactions that people perform to the, the trauma whether that's current, modern day trauma, family trauma, or historical trauma. The wounding wounding of my people. And the wounding of my people's story. And so, when there's power-wounding going on, um, people don't have full access to their power, and, and the insidious part of it is it's often time not really clear to them that they are in fact, wounded. Because if you've been performing, and your people have been performing for years these behaviors or these constraints, we can only go so far, uh, what's-, don't go out there and get-, get hurt, don't-, don't move beyond the pasture, because it's dangerous out there, because historically, it was but if we keep passing that on, then people get more and more constricted in their ability to read what's possible. And, part of the process for me is helping people to name that, so that they can change it. 

00:30:02
DAVID HOOKER I love, one of the favorite, uh, phrases that you use that I adopted is the notion that you can't heal what you conceal. And yet, there's like this space of agency as though people are actually concealing it, when much of the constraint that exists is kind of embedded in the discourse. It's, it's floated so much into the background that we don't even know, and sometimes I find myself in certain kind of engagement, where I might have even bought into the discourse, and can't necessarily help them to see outside of what I can see, as part of their possibilities or horizons. So as as a therapist, how, what are some of the models or ways that you think about expanding the possibility horizons where people, expanding the range of agency, even beyond what either you can see on their behalf, or what the language and the structures that have been set up that we've inherited project as possible. 

00:31:07
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, I think it-, 'cause I think that's really important, as if there's a deliberate attempt to conceal or deny, some of it's not yet knowable, but everything is potentially knowable. And I think that is some of it means that we craft how we do therapy differently. 'Cause part of therapy, then becomes a search for narratives, and for counter and new narratives. Especially empowering narratives. And I'm sittin' here thinking in particular, one client who came in, and there was a lot of issues around suppression, and because I speak in the language of power, and begin to look at, like, what is the generational patterns of power, as we do a genogram (ph), like, tell me your family history around power. Begin to tell these stories, and, and, she's spontaneously offered, my parents have a slave mentality. Now I could have, I knew-, that-, we knew what it meant, we a little bit about that, but I coulda let that stay, as a slave mentality, the shorthand for a suppressed lifestyle, but it felt important for me, as a therapist, and for her own healing, of her family story. Is, let's back up and understand how people who love their child could come to operate out of this limiting constricting way, and we gotta understand their history. So we gotta go back and tell the story of your parents, and their growing up, and their grandparents, and what happened, and in both the privileged, and the powers is it's part of that. That takes something that is a history lesson in therapy. And I think that therapy, when done well, is its own history. You know, we're unpacking our history, so, for me, it's, which then opens up a new space. So if I know this story now, about grandma, well how does that change me? If I-, if I didn't know this, or I think often times, especially when we're talking about legacies of enslavement, is um, people feel something, and often the shame is, on-, on both ends, if you've been, the, descendants of enslaved folks, there's a certain shame, I think, that comes with that, and if you are, um, descendants of enslavers, a certain shame, and when we're embedded in those shame stories, we can't move, and so part of the therapy is, is inviting out the story. And, then unpacking it, and, and explaining 'What does that feel like for you?' 'How does that show up in your life today?' 'How does it limit t-, limit you, how does it help you expand?' And, more importantly, 'What do you wanna do about it?' Which goes back to the agency issue. Now that I now the story, what do I wanna do about it? 

00:33:37
DAVID HOOKER And so the piece that I like to use from there to expand that conversation, both for individuals and communities, in addition to understanding, kind of how the family story is played, over multiple generations, if, at each of those generations, as the family story is being told, to get some further sense of what was happening in the community, and what was happening in the nation that made that kind of a reasonable response. And so while it may have seemed that, uh, 1945, you know, the convict leasing system was being finished, and African Americans were really kind of free, at the same time, they were being reminded, because that's when the Japanese internment started, that we are in this country, we aren't above, you know, uh, imprisoning folks because of ethnic or whatever, those kinds of other things, are. So, even when the conditions seemed to have evaporated in your current context, if you're recognizing some of the international context, and some of the global context, that has to be filtered through the stories of the community, and filtered through the stories of the family. Then, you get a chance to start saying, 'Oh, and this is how that story came to me.' Sometimes the story comes in the silence. It comes by them blacking out what happened, wha-, you know, not allowing people to remember what was going on at the time. 

00:35:02
VANESSA JACKSON I, I think that's really important, when I-, I had an opportunity to do work on African American psychiatric history, which then, maybe have to go back into African American history, uh, and, you know, one of the things that I, that came outta that is that how important it is, history is healing, history can be, be wounding as you start to hear it, and painful, but when you know about a story, you know about the context, and what it, how it was embedded in the wider politics and, and social fabric of a land, it helps you sort of understand your position, the position of your family story, and your community story, and people story in a different way. And my thing is that people don't oftentimes, are deprived deliberately, the blackout, oftentimes for us, literally, the blackout. Of understanding both what was going on, the level of oppression, the amazing triumph and resistance and resilience, and so going back and looking at the context, the historical context for the wider society that, th-, the stage on which my family story was playing out. But if I look at this little corner in which my family is playing out it's story, and I don't look at the full stage, and then wor-, think about the theater and who got invited to witness this, then I miss something. And I think that's that whole piece about people understanding this happening at different levels all the time, and you're constantly having to move back, uh, which means yo-, you need more than 50 minutes. To unpack all that story, and so, that's the other issue, becomes is, how do we create the spaces and the time and honor the unfolding process, to allow people to understand the impact of historical trauma on their present day, their lives. 

00:36:47
DAVID HOOKER And, one of the things that-, one of the ways that people can go back and reclaim, which is really important for me, is um, you know, we-, we look in history, and history was primarily written by uh, folks who get to control the narrative. And so there are other histories, there are other sources that aren't quite as authoritative. Indeed, what authoritative means is they don't support the dominate narrative. But then there are some other places to look for the markers. Where are the, uh, symbols, where are the songs, the Judy Atkinson (ph) talks about the, uh, trauma trails that you can be traced through songs. Like there are certain songs that my mother sings, but she only sings them at certain times. And, I know when she's troubled, because she sings these songs. And, I ask her, 'Where do you learn that song?' and that's the song that her mother sang at her mother's mother's funeral. And she only sings it when she's in the midst of her deepest kind of either grief or celebration, so that I can take the song, and begin to help trace back with them some of those markers and so history can be unveiled. And I think that you're right, Starhawk (ph) is right, that you're right, that knowledge, that power, is knowable. 

00:38:02
VANESSA JACKSON Right. 

00:38:07
DAVID HOOKER The access to power is knowable, but you can't necessarily look in the places that people would tell you to look, because there's a dominant narrative that kind of structures where the appropriate places to look, and how it is to find it. 

00:38:17
VANESSA JACKSON And-, and we-, you know, that's interesting, we're talking community people that we work with, who are really trying to work hard on-, on-, and-, on-, in gauging these issues of the legacy and aftermath and enslavement, and the call was like, we'll bring you historical documents, the pickle jars, the-, and I'm sittin' here thinkin', you know, my folks are kinda enslaved, we didn't have the luxury of the pickle jar, or the quilled. Though some people did- 

00:38:42
DAVID HOOKER Sure. 

00:38:47
VANESSA JACKSON But there's a lot of us that didn't. You know, that we were lucky to get out with our lives, and so, then, how I look for my history and understand that, uh, when I first moved, uh, to Atlanta, I spent some time at the Southeast ar-, uh, National Archives, looking, doing genealogical research, and I remember looking at um, going back and trying to find the-, the-, you know, roles in Mississippi and Missouri for my people, and getting to the 1860 census. Where we drop off as people. And become property. And, and the mo-, just seeing that image, was re-traumatizing. I-, I mean, it told the story of what was going on back then, but it hit me in that moment, and then shifted, sort of, who I thought think I am. And certainly, who I thought other people were, who would make my people property. So I can't even find my grandfather. In 1860, 'cause I didn't know who owned him. And so, I mean, so the looking at history, and recovering history, it's-, it's-, it's an investigative process, and you-, and you celebrate the small little gems of that, and I'll-, now think about a larger sort of community narrative around that. My research project was finding the segregated hospitals, the free-standing segregated psychiatric hospitals. Now I hadn't even thought about there being any before. And there were, in fact, seven or eight of them. And one of them, I found, and I, I said it was hiding in plain sight. Lake and State Hospital (ph), which actually has a fantastic pain-fill because it's asylum. Fantastic, because it's all black staff. Top to bottom. The psychi-, and it was the most well-trained staff in the country. Black or white. People were-, Menninger (ph) came and trained there, and I'm sittin' there reading that, you know, I'm, on one hand, seeing the building, feelin' all that feeling, thinkin' 'bout black people out in the country and all this kinda stuff, and the pain of family separations, and then I see a picture of these people, and I thought what would that have felt like for me, as being a black graduate student in a school of social work. If I had known 20 years ago that this was my history, too. And so, the way that when you can bring it forward, you can find it hiding in plain sight, literally on a ghost hunter's website, 'cause there was nothing in the national narrative about these hospitals, it had been disappeared. But to find it on a ghost hunter's website, and in that, find a way for me to take incredible pride that we were not just recipients of care, we were providers of care, and in fact, in that time period, the most innovative care happening in psychiatric hospitals. That story still doesn't get told. And so, that for me is the power. And obviously, the excitement, of history, and when we weave it into therapy, it gives people anchors. And I think that we need to do that a lot more than we do. It's not too complicated for people to understand, it isn't an extraneous conversation, it's the heart and soul of knowing who you are. Is you've gotta go back and touch that history. 

00:41:57
DAVID HOOKER One of the places that you talk about, uh, as a way of beginning to help people think through, um, their healing process their triumphant process, is uh, the psychology of hope, and the notions of willpower and way-power. And I'm trying to get a full appreciation particularly of the way-power. Not so much the willpower, 'cause I believe that often inside, there's an innate drive to be successful and to be good and to thrive and to be productive. And sometimes the way-power, particularly when you have structures that are remnants, and you know-, and it's not-, and it's not just the it's the socializing structure. So inside education, inside, uh, justice, inside of theology, there are often you know, these limiting, these socializing structures that teach people to conform to a narrative of isolation, and oppression, and they aren't necessarily given the skillset, the where-with-all, to access their way-power. Which I think is really important, so once you've unveiled this knowledge, how do you actually develop the way-power, knowing that socializing structures are primarily designed to reproduce the the socializing structure? 

00:43:22
VANESSA JACKSON Y-, and I started smiling before you said that, 'cause, the answer that popped in my head immediately that's why there's always great that there those radicals, the people that were rebelling, the people that were you know, subversive, and, and so the way-power oftentimes, especially when there's' these larger cultural stories of oppression and marginalization, is I wanna look first to the people who were kickin' up the dust. The people who were sabotagin', the pe-, so, so that's the first thing about the way-power, 'cause way-power's not always this neat nice path. It can sometimes be the people who risk everything. In fact, Snider's-, C.J. Snider's work on hope, I had to stop and get really re-engaged with it, because he-, he's talking about hope, and, and so these levels of high hope people, and low hope people, and the scale, and willpower and way-power, indicating whether you had this high hope potential. And-, and in his writings he talks about wondering if, for marginalized people of color, if, when they regi-, when we answer questions that would indicate that we are high hope, if we are, in fact, authenti-, really what he was sayin', I think, is authe-, he had a better way of saying it, that obscured this question, was an authentic high hope. Because are we-, where we were being hopeful within the context of what we believe to be possible for ourselves. Which immediately made me question if the man had any sense about evolution work, or civil rights work, and constant resistance, throwing myself in the water, smashing my baby's head, 'cause I refuse to live in these conditions, that he would construct the possibility that it was a different kinda hope, it's like, to have hope in the midst of those circumstances, talks about willpower, and a way-power, that is in fact, in my mind, more extraordinary than somebody who doesn't have those barriers and constraints. And so the way-power, again, is, saying the-, one is the potential. The other thing about his work is that it's very attached to the goals. That willpower and will-, way-power, don't make that much sense in the absence of understand-, it's our path to goals. And so, if my goal is freedom, if my goal is liberation, or my goal is the elevation of my children, my willpower is like, I am dead serious about makin' sure that my babies get where they need to-, I'm going to lift my child higher, I am gonna deal with whatever circumstances, humiliation, whatever, to ensure, and, in fact, in terms of some of the integration work, is I'm even willing to risk the lives of my children. Because I am putting them on a bus with people who loathe them. And so, um, so you have these sort of the willpower, and the, the way, that we're gonna make this work. We're gonna do this, we're gonna show up here, we're gonna pray, we're gonna do all kinda things, we're gonna often times, collective, we are gonna connect with other people, so we're no longer in isolation. And, we're gonna make the way while we're walking. So it's not always clear the full path. And I think that's often really important therapy. It's okay not to know where this is, uh, the path is going. We understand we're tryin' to get over here, but how we get there, i-, sometimes you've gotta make some cut-throughs, or backtrack, and those sort of things. So um, that's-, well, the way-power is really about all the way-, the manners in which you can accomplish that goal and get to that goal, how to do it, that it's do-able, and the steps-, and believing in the individual steps to get there. That is propelled by the willpower. 

00:46:52
DAVID HOOKER So one of the things that, the-, one of the distinctions that I think, uh, people make around hope, where folks don't fully appreciate the hope that comes from people who exist in kinda the belly of the struggle, in the depths of the struggle. They-, they fail to make a distinction between hope and optimism. As though, based on what you've seen, and what you're looking forward to, that that determines the level of your trajectory, and most marginalized people are not optimistic. Optimism is something where you optic-, you look back, and based on what you've seen, either back, or what you can actually see, looking forward, you actually make a projection of a positive outcome, and so most marginalized people are not optimistic people, but they are hopeful people in the sense that they can project into a future something that is not all all based on what they're currently seeing, or experiencing, or have any tangible relationship with. And so, the other thing that we don't really get trained in, I didn't, get trained in, which has to do with a way of expanding this notion of way-power. Is, the analysis of metaphors. Like people we live inside of metaphors, the people use the language that, and the metaphor constrains you, because inside of your metaphor, inside of the myth-, the character that you created inside of this particular metaphor, there are only so many options for action that you have, and so part of the way-power, includes seeing things in a different way, which requires some level of discourse analysis that allows you, allows the therapist, to help people to create different metaphors. And to deconstruct the assumptions that they're operating in in the metaphors that they have, and notice those, because a lot of those assumptions are based on legacy, they're based on constraints, they're based on somethin' that no longer really exists. Nor that the people say that they believe. But they're still operating inside of it, because it's the only language that they have, for seeking a way forward. 

00:49:02
VANESSA JACKSON It-, well list-, you know-, problem is like we bring that out into the street level. How would you expla-, say that with a client, and when I was thinkin' that for a second, I thought well you know what this is not the stuff that clients have a hard time understanding. So tell me your story. And sometimes what I end up doin' is like, I just heard that story, and-, and this is what I think, what you said it meant to you, and oftentimes, 'Can I offer you my perspective on what I heard? And what is really a f-, sort of the power of it' is I say, 'When I heard that story, you're tellin' me the story bein' broken down, and I get the pain there, I just head the story of a kinda willpower, a willingness to struggle a willingness to persevere, and, and that you in fact did this really creative thing that, like, and I am serious, I'm not like playin' it up, that, how did you think-, how did you know to do that? And do you see, and let's break it down, and and, so you need to know what you did there, so you could replicate it somewhere else. When you told me that story, there was this story, and then there was another story within it. And that was a s-, triumph story. When you were telling me your story of your wounding, embedded in that was a story of your resistance, of your hope, of the ways that you were tryin 'to negotiate it. And so it's, in some ways, it's how we listen, and that we know as therapists, to look for the spark, the power that, the resistance spark, and some of our job is to uh, feed that flame? Or as it-, one of my clients was walking out the door one day and she was feeling really-, she says, 'Is it really gonna get better?' And I was like, 'Yeah.' And I's like, 'This isn't gonna take a hot second, but it's gonna get better.' She goes, 'Okay, you hold the hope until I can carry it myself.' 

00:50:47
DAVID HOOKER Mm-hmm, and so one of the things that you just, just i-, just in that, uh, demonstration, uh, the way that you related to the client by shifting the story, it's how you construct the counter narrative, and what, uh, Hildy Nelson, Hildy Lindeman (ph) Nelson talks about i-, i-, is the idea that often the counter-story has to be told by someone else until the person can endorse it. Until I can carry this hope for myself, you hold it, and as long as you're tellin' the counter-story, and I'm beginning to look around, I'm gonna say, 'Well I see it this way,' But I bet Vanessa really would see it like this, and over a while, you can start seeing it, uh, in a different way. I have a colleague who was working in Nargus (ph), uh, well, working in-, we were working together in Myanmar, she was in a different part, right after the cyclone, Nargus, and she was working with a little boy, probably 10, maybe 11 years old who, when the flood happened, he ta-, he was completely depressed and, actually doing some self-destructive things, and as he explained the story, it's because he had been holding on to his grandfather, um, during the flood, and at some point, you know, and there were, uh, refrigerators, and limbs and things rushing away, and at some point, he actually got struck by a major piece of debris, and he could hold his grandfather any longer, and his grandfather was lost. And so he kept saying, how bad he was, and how useless he was. And, Elaine got a chance, she said, you know, I'm hearing this story, but tell me again, there was a flood raging, and instead of worrying about your own life, you were trying to save your grandfather? You were thinking about, and then, when he got a chance to tell the story again, he got to the part where he says, you know, he-, 'cause he had been tellin' the story over and over again, he would get to that part, and say, 'I was a very bad boy, 'cause I let my grandfather die.' And he got to that part, and he stopped, and he looked at somebody else who had been telling a different counter-narrative, and he said, 'Maybe I was strong. Because I tried to hold him.' And just then you could see his trajectory.
