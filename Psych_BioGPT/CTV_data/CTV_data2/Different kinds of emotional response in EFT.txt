Different kinds of emotional response in EFT 

00:00:15
ROBERT ELLIOT EFT distinguishes four types of emotion response. It's an important distinction for uh… say an EFT uh… that not all emotion is the same. Some kinds of emotion responses are constructive and others uh… are getting the way or don't help people umm… due to situations. So the first of these four kinds of emotion responses uh… are "primary adaptive emotions" and these are the natural sort of biologically or evolutionarily given emotion responses. So umm… if I um… having my boundaries violated someone is in, invading my privacy or damaging my property umm… then that's a violation of my boundaries and I will properly and adaptively become angry, the anger will help me to maintain and guard my boundary as I go to boundary I'll say that's enough of that please, stop. I needed to stop umm… I'll make a boundary so that's an adaptive anger. That's the anger which helps me to maintain a boundary in the face of violation with that boundary. Uh… and so that's, that's a useful emotion that's a part of our evolutionary heritage and people do not get stuck in adaptive anger. Uh… they do have over get stop, stuck in maladaptive anger and that's an anger uh… which is feels like it's about things if happen in the past it's an whole bad stuck feeling. Umm… and it's so like people always mistreat me, people always umm… take advantage of me, I never get a fair break uh… people always breaking my… violating my boundaries. And this maladaptive anger doesn't help people cope umm… it's you know part of what we mean by "roadrage" umm… it's get involved in fears kinds of harmful damaging anger expression umm… and so it is in useful and it's and and when we talk about adaptive and maladaptive we're really talking about whether something useful or not useful. So "primary maladaptive emotion" is the person's first response to the situation which because of their history uh… of previous events they now over reactive uh… and the way it doesn't fit the situation. The third of kind of emotion response that we distinguish we call "secondary reactive emotion" and here they would secondary simply means it came second. There was a first response which could have been a useful adaptive first response or not useful not adaptive, maladaptive first response. And then the person had a response of that emotional response. So umm… for example umm… someone insult my pride umm… and I get angry so my first emotion is shame umm… and then I get angry about the shame, I then attack and this tends to be as I said the kind of anger they gets out of control uh… that causes damage in relationships umm… and so "secondary reactive anger" people get stuck in and cause their problems to get worst. So umm… what are clients come to us commonly with is the "secondary reactive uh… emotions" of various kinds. Uh… people with explosive anger uh… problems are anger so called "anger management problems" typically have secondary reactive uh… anger process series or they might have uh… "primary maladaptive anger responses" which is like a ship on the shoulder where everything is an insult and everything feels like a violation. And so our clients come to us with "secondary reactive emotion responses" and "primary maladaptive emotion responses". And this is what we then try help our clients work within try to help them move uh… towards a "primary adaptive emotion response" which is often before or underneath uh… say "secondary reactive emotion". Uh… the fourth and final type of emotion response is an instrumental uh… emotion response and this is an emotion which is displayed for its intended to effect. The guard list of what the person actually feels. So instrumental anger is commonly, commonly takes the form of bullying or some kind of deliberate behavior to… .intimidate other people. Umm… and another example of instrumental anger something that I was taught as uh… a young person living and growing up in California where there are mountain lines and the what you what you need to know about meaning a "mountain line" in a sort of "mountain path" in California is that you must never run away from them because they would they will chase after you attack them umm… and instead what you do is you step forward you raise your arms spread them apart and you yell at them with a loud voice. This is "instrumental anger", right? Uh… you might be terrified inside but you are trying to scare away the mountain line by intimidating it. So that's a of course a useful uh… adaptive use of an "instrumental emotion response" umm… in our into personal relationships we get things like bullying and people putting on emotions in a way, in ways to cover up emotions. So instrumental emotions uh… can become manipulative in relationships and damage them. Umm… but uh… many… "instrumental emotions" are actually quite useful.
