RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. My name's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and I'd like to welcome you to this webcast on managing anxiety and surveying the range of ideas about the nature of anxiety and, most importantly, what practitioners can do about it in their consulting rooms. And we are very fortunate today to have as our guest a international presenter, uh, has the, for my money, one of the great accents of any of the presenters in any of our webcast series, Danie Beaulieu. Danie? 

00:00:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Bonjour! Yeah? Hi! 

00:00:45
RICH SIMON Bonjour back to you. So, we're, uh, is, our subject here is anxiety and, um, so the, this, the staple of therapeutic practice for many of us. Who hasn't dealt with clients coming in because they have some problem with anxiety? What's the framework that you work out? What's your basic notion of what's the nature of anxiety and, and what is your role as a therapeutic practitioner when clients come in complaining about their anxiety? 

00:01:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Well, Rich, I was tired of looking at anxiety as a pathology. And most clients who arrive in our practice, typically they are kind of trying to convince that anxiety is a bad thing and that we need to get rid of it and it's just like and sometimes even, uh, finding their body like a, a, a threat, really. And I wanted to find a way to look at anxiety as a help for me as a co-therapist to help clients, um, understand themselves better, feel better about what their choices, their decisions, what they do with their lives, and I found it. Um, to me, anxiety is definitely a great, great feedback from our body telling us "Hey, hey you're lost somewhere." And it is so difficult nowadays to be lost, simply because there are so many external stimulations. I mean, it's no wonder that nowadays, there are more anxiety than ever in the history of humanity, cuz I, no other time of our history we had so many external stimulation. So, to me, anxiety is a way to, like, something knocking within us and saying, "Hey, hey, you're lost. You need to listen to your own rhythm, to your own essence, and make sure you respect that if you want to have the life you want to have." 

00:02:50
RICH SIMON So, so now what are the hallmarks of the way you work, and we'll be talking more about impact therapy and the way you, you ingeniously use all kinds of tools and props in your therapy, but you have a way of, uh, of capturing, of using metaphor and concrete objects in the way that you work with your clients and the way you train. So, what, what are some of these, uh, metaphors that you use when you-- 

00:03:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Well, they're really, they are really dedicated to the different causes of anxiety. One of the main causes to me is what I call the GPS. That is, you know, everybody, most people know what a GPS can do, that is, you enter a destination, and the dest, the, the GPS tells you where to go where to go, where to turn, and of course if you don't follow the right path, your GPS will say recalculating. And I think often we hear the recalculating inside of us cuz we don't take the right path. And so you want an example of how I can use a metaphor in this specific, uh, case. I had this man who was, uh, driving a truck. He was a truckdriver, and for about a year he was out of work. I mean, he was, he had pain in his back, but he also had some panic attacks while driving his huge, uh, truck, so he, he probably saw -- I'm not exaggerating -- at least 10 different people. How come he had that pain and he had these panic attacks? When I saw the gentleman, I said, "Well, listen, you've seen so many people. I'm not sure what else I can do for you, but, um, one question I actually would like you to answer is do you like your job?" And he said, "I hate it!" I said, "Well, why do you do it?" I mean, that was clearly a response from the GPS saying, I'm sorry, do something else. And the whole body was yelling "Do something else." And of course the gentleman started arguing and saying, "Well, listen, I didn't go to school, I didn't have the degrees, and I have a family to feed, and this is the, the..." All the blah, blah. So what I did is I took a sheet of paper, and we see it on the camera, and I, I asked, I mean, I put on the sheet of paper: solution. I wrote that on the sheet of paper. Solution. And I gave it to the guy, and I said, "Could you please hold it in front of you." I mean, like, it was, so that he could see the page. And I said, "You know, I think the solution, you have it in your face." That is, uh, you hate it. Your whole body, your whole, everything within you is saying "Stop doing it." I don't think the title of your therapy is How to Handle Anxiety. I think the title of your therapy is How to Have the Courage to Listen to This Solution. I really believe, Rich, that anxiety is the solution for many, many clients. You know, I have this kid, um, he lived in a wonderful family, and the parents were so supportive. They're great, great parents, cuz when I saw the kid, and he was having panic attacks in the middle of the night. I mean, waking up at two o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning, having panic attacks. So, you know, he, he was investigated by, um, psychiatrists, all kind of therapists, saying, "Oh, it's some kind of schizophrenia that, you know, starts around teenage, and..." I, I, I don't like that kind of interpretation. I like to believe that anxiety is a friend, so I, I, I work as you, as you know, with eye movement integration, so in this case that was how I found out about the etiology of... The problem was that he, uh, didn't want to become a dentist, but it seems like everybody in his family, including uncles and aunts, cuz they were very, very tied together, and he didn't want to become a dentist, but he was fearful that if I say that to my parents, I'm gonna get rejected. It was so unconscious that he couldn't, that, I mean, he was waking up in the middle of the night with these inner, you know, feelings of anxiety, so, um, in this case, what I had to teach him, uh, again, it was not to find another answer. The anxiety was the answer. It was telling the kid, "You are not a dentist. Do, you know, honor what you've received." So in this specific case, um, I, I, the only thing I did with him is simply to, um, uh, give him some modeling and practice the modeling of how he could talk to his parents and tell the truth -- become a dentist. The parents owe -- is that all, is that all there is? Because all we want, son, is for you to be happy. So, uh, there are different ways to, uh, see anxiety as an answer, and I think in this case, this is another example where anxiety was a beautiful gift for this kid. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON So, so, to take a step actually, you have another concept, and let's, let's put the GPS in the, in the context of your, this notion you have about the anxiety circle, which is a, a, the particular way that you think about in the, in the broader sense, about anxiety and what it means when somebody comes in. Talk to us a little bit about the anxiety circle, and then we'll come back in a moment to the concept of the GPS. 

00:08:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay. Okay. So, in the anxiety circle, what I've put are different circles are different etiologies, and to my, to the best of my knowledge, if we do intervene in any one of these circles, we gonna stop the anxiety circle, just like, you know, imagine an electrical wire, you know, with a lamp at the other end, okay? Wherever you cut the damn wire, the lamp is not gonna light up, right? So same thing here in this circle. Where you stop the anxiety, it's gonna work. So what I like about this is that, um, if you have more, um, specialities, or if you feel better intervening with the thinking, the thoughts, of course, with a behavioral-cognitive approach, many therapists are, you know, very competent with that. Well, it will work, of course it will. If you wanna work with a situation like the person cannot approach bridges, for instance, and feel tremendously anxious when they, well, we can work with a situation, of course, with desensitization. So this is in a, but, to me, there's not necessarily one specific place where anxiety starts for every client. It starts at different places. So, what I think I have added in that circle of, you know, um, let's, let's say we begin with the GPS, that is again this beautiful answer from our bodies, saying you're not respecting the road you're supposed to follow. From there, you know, like, you, you have a specific situation, in this guy's I've, I've given you, driving a truck. The client, of course, is not feeling good driving a truck, has some thoughts about it. Uh, I have to start, you, you know, I have to drive the truck. That's the only way I can feed my family. And from there, you will have the alarm response saying, "Okay, there's a problem here," right? And you will have all these manifestations in your body, because, you know, you feel the, the, the, that there's a danger, so there's the fight-or-flight answers and a very powerful imprint in your limbic system, changing the master program, which means from then on, the client will have a hard time getting in the truck, that's if you have a panic attack in the truck, until this situation becomes this panic attack in the truck, the thought, "I can no longer drive a truck." And from there, you have the alarm system. You have this, all this manifestations and this anchored, uh, anchored in your, encourage or, in your limbic system and from there, it's gonna be more and more difficult. So anywhere you choose to intervene in there, I, you know, my idea is that we will stop the, the circle. 

00:11:50
RICH SIMON Mmmhmm, okay. So now, so sometimes, do you ever work at that more behavioral level, certain thoughts that people have, the cognitive, the irrational thought, trying to get people to calm down their physiology? Is that a, a mode of working with anxiety that you find useful some of the time? Or is, or is -- 

00:12:10
DANIE BEAULIEU I do, I do. I certainly do, Ed, um, I, uh, I mean Rich, I certainly do, because it's, you know, I don't think we can avoid it, like, in the case where I have given you the example of this little boy wanting to become a dentist. We practiced for one session, I played the parents, both of them, and, you know, I just coach him like a good coach of how he could, you know, tell his whole truth to his parents, and it was, uh, you should have seen him when he walked out my office. He felt so, you know, in, he was 15, but he felt so tall and, and so handsome and so ready to go tell his truth, so, um, you know, in terms of, um, one of the, the tool I've used with him, I took again a sheet of paper, just because you're everywhere, so, they, they come back, which, you know. I gave the, the sheet of paper to my client, and I said, "Could you please remove the wood," out of it. Cuz as you know, paper is made out of wood, right? So I gave him the, the sheet of paper, and, uh, of course he was unable to remove the wood. The link that I do with anxiety is that to me the wood is the essence of the sheet. Without the wood, you get some kind of paste, right? And we do have as an individual, we all have our wood, we have our essence, and in his case, he was trying to get the wood out of his life, which is, um, his own idiosyncrasy. He was trying to get away of who he was to try to fit with his parent's expectation. So for him, it was very powerful to know that if you try to get your own essence away from you to please other people, you're gonna turn into some kind of paste. I mean, you're, you know, you'll no longer be who you were, and you'll no longer, you're, you're not gonna have your own identity. And the good news in this case, I said, "Make sure every time you see a piece of paper, you remember this." So he, this lesson will sort of come back many times, and to me this is a powerful one, uh, because it really, it really taps into, um, the main etiology of what I've seen in most my clients. Not respecting their essence, trying to be be someone who they're not. 

00:14:55
RICH SIMON Their direction in life. 

00:14:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. 

00:14:55
RICH SIMON So, so once, so once you and your, so someone's come in in the state of confusion that people often have. They're feeling anxious about who knows what. They come into your office. You, you, um, in terms of how do you then determine what, what's the focus then? So once, if the complaint is anxiety, uh, early on in the first couple of sessions, what's going on that helps you get, determine this, the, the road and how this, the relevance of the GPS to their particular life circumstance. 

00:15:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, I have a strong propency to look at, uh, the, I have six or seven different points on the GPS. Why don't we, uh, look at them together. So that usually, typically my clients will fit most of them in one of those. So the first one would be, um, uh, um, sorry, okay. The first one would be some, um, repressed needs, okay? I've given two examples of that, right? The truck driver. He's not respecting his own needs. This is, uh, or the fears that he cannot even start to think about. Uh, another example would, at, which is, um, by the way, um, highly underestimated I believe is the state of vulnerability. Let me give you an example. On a scale of zero to ten, let's say ten is you have high energy and zero being woah, not fearing, feeling good at all. I've noticed, and I, I, I was able to, um, uh, confirm that in some of the readings I've done, that many people will have their first panic attacks when they are between zero and two. That is their whole body is saying what are you doing trying to make this kind of, um, let's say, uh, flight overseas, for instance, cuz it takes a lot of energy to do that, and if you do not have enough energy, your body knows it. Your GPS knows it, and it will send a signal, often anxiety or a panic attack, telling you it's, it's not a good idea to do it. Let me give you an example, a concrete example that comes to mind with that. A colleague of mine is married with a diplomat. She lives in Ottawa. But she was studying in Montreal, so she was commuting like a couple hours, you know, morning and evenings like three, four times a week. One night he says, "Listen, we have a delegation here, people coming from specific place on earth, and it's important that you, you're there to support me," and she's dead tired. I mean, she's having some exams in school. She's, uh, cuz she's taking some classes in Montreal, and she's really dead tired, and she decides to go. She said, "Danie, when I got there, with all the people in the room, it sort of--" then she realized how much energy it would take her to deal with that evening and these conversation. She said, "My heart started beating, I started shaking, and all I had in my head is, 'Get out of there, get out of there.'" And believe it or not, she interpreted the situation in saying you can no longer be with your partner on these kinds of events, and it was not the point. I mean, it was just a beautiful gift from her GPS saying, "I'm sorry that you don't know yourself good enough to realize that you, you absolutely no have, you don't have the energy to do that tonight." So, I think, nowadays with the kind of schedule that mothers have, that fathers have, that family have, uh, they do often have answer from the GPS saying, "Sorry, you are in a vulnerable state. It's time to stop." Uh, people are trying to cope with everything, uh, at once, and they can't, so this a second, very powerful answer from the GPS. 

00:19:10
RICH SIMON So this, this idea that often people get into the panic experience or some kind of anxiety attack, it begins, you have to run the clock back, and there's something, a functional, very sensible accurate reading of their own state of depletion pushing beyond that and then people begin to experience these, these things that become psychological symptoms. They become panic attacks, they become anxiety attacks. 

00:19:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Well, it is so powerful, the answer. You, you know, the more you wait to hear the answer of your GPS, the more you wait, the stronger the anxiety will speak, and the, to the point where it becomes a very, full-blown panic attack, and from there they will be this imprint or these anchors in your limbic system, uh, and changing your, your master program, saying, you can no longer do that. 

00:20:10
RICH SIMON Anxiety circle comes in that once you had one of these overwhelming experiences of anxiety or terror, then it's something set within your physiology that can easily... 

00:20:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Yes, yes. I had a friend of mine. I was -- I'm sorry, I was talking, I was calling you Ed. It's because I was, uh, thinking of this example with Ed. He was, you know, dead tired in a, in an air, in a, um, flughafen, what is... 

00:20:40
RICH SIMON We have a multilingual... 

00:20:40
DANIE BEAULIEU No, an airport, an airport, okay? He was in an airport, and he was so dead tired with the jet lags and how many flights and, you know, flights were late, and, and so, uh, he said, "Danie, my heart started beating. I started feeling, you know, weak," and he said to himself, "Ed, don't panic, you're having a panic attack." And I think I wish everybody could be able to say that, you know, to understand this is a state of vulnerability, and your anxiety is only a, a service to you to tell you, "I'm sorry, I do not have the energy to support you in that last flight to get home." So that, I mean, that would be wonderful if everybody could be able to do that. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON All right, so you're taking us through these things that we're looking for. So we have this question of, uh, repressed need, of not listening to a, a vulnerability, putting-- 

00:21:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Okay, there's a third one. A very popular one as well, which is the lack of competence, competency, you say in English? The lack of competences, that is, uh, oh, have you watched Crocodile Dundee? 

00:21:50
RICH SIMON Sure. What, what is? 

00:21:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Mmhmm, so do you remember this beautiful blonde journalist going to, uh, the outback of Australia and of course with Crocodile Dundee, the best guide around, you know, to support her, and eventually she's there, you know, very nicely putting some water in her face by a lake and here comes a crocodile. And, you know, bite her camera and tries to pull, uh, pull her into the lake, and then she start yelling and yelling. You know, of course she's very, very anxious because she doesn't have the competencies. And here comes Crocodile Dundee, stepping on crocodile, on the crocodile, and yuck with the knife, and he's not feeling anxious a bit, right? Because he has the competencies. So, I think, um, if you look at children, how to talk to their parents, how to, uh, talk to some friends, to, uh, significant people, sometimes it will experience a lot of anxiety cuz they do not have the skills. they do not have the abilities. If I suspect this is the problem, uh, and it's often the case in children, well, it really helps tremendously anxiety, so if this is the problem, I am starting to work with them and as a coach, just to teach them some skills to face whatever situation they need to face. I had this gentlemen. He was single. 45. A very funny guy, but he could not talk to women. I mean he was anxious every time he had to talk to women. He had this, you know, history of, uh, mother, of course, mother is in there, but, um, just, uh, coach him on how he could talk to that lady at the bank, cuz he really liked that lady at the bank. That was it for him, to really, uh, help him face his anxiety. It's different from pure desensitization, when you get closer and closer, closer to the situation. Here, the problem was really to teach skills, new skills and practice them, uh, with the client. So I, I see this is, um, again another very powerful or frequent, uh, etiology of anxiety. If you think about students in school, right, and they have an exam, but they did not study. What do you think the GPS will say, hey, what are you gonna do, you know, when you're gonna have to answer the questions? So, uh, again here teaching them to see anxiety as a powerful friend, just preventing a disastrous situation if you do not study. Again, it was the answer, so that would be number three. 

00:24:55
RICH SIMON And, and also some people are competent in some situations. Crocodile D, for example, turns out he, he owes the Australian government about $100 million worth of back taxes, so he's great with crocodiles, not so competent when it comes to paying his taxes. I got the item in the People Magazine recently, so... I just cueing in our audience in the latest in celebrity gossip. So that said, moving on, so you keep expanding the context. You're listening, people are expressing their anxiety, and then you're going for what's really, what is this anxiety telling us. 

00:25:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, I found that with the GPS again, a fourth very powerful, um, source of anxiety, especially in teenagers. It's guilt. You know when, when you've done something that you know you should not have done, you start feeling bad and your anxiety is saying, "Hey, go apologize. Go--" I mean, and this is again a gift. I mean, when I see teenagers, because you know, I don't wanna get into the teenager stuff, cuz my last book was for teenagers, but it's only in French, so... But, uh, it's, it's clear that teenagers are gonna do all kind of foolish things. I suspect that when you were a teenager, you probably did a lot of those. Just looking at you now and how wild you can be at your symposium, I suspect you probably had something to hide. Anyway-- 

00:26:30
RICH SIMON My inner teenager speaks, yes. 

00:26:35
DANIE BEAULIEU So I think, um, to let it out, to allow the client to let it out, like I, I have this very, very great, uh, technique, impact techniques, with a, a garbage bag. And ideally it has to smell, okay? So, oh yeah, it has to smell very strong, okay? And, uh, I, and you, you close it but it still smell, right? So you ask the teenager, "Have you noticed that even if the bag is shut or closed, uh, it still smell?" It reminds me of you. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON Oh dear. 

00:27:15
DANIE BEAULIEU Not you, Rich, not you, of course, but I'm saying. 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON It could never be me, okay. I get ya. 

00:27:20
DANIE BEAULIEU It reminds me of you in terms of having something inside. Even if you don't say anything about it, if it something you regret, if it is something you're, you know, feeling shameful or feeling, uh, guilty of, it smells. I'm sure that when you are with your friends or with your parents or at school, it does smell. Um, I had not so long ago a gentleman, he was in his 40s. And he sort of, he has been a teenager all his life and now he decided to get serious, you know, and, uh, he got married and now his wife is pregnant. The problem is he never told her that he had a criminal record. And now that he's gonna become a father, he feels a lot of anxiety he goes to bed, and he's very anxious, and he wakes up during the night, and he's anxious. Because of his inner garbage bag. 

00:28:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. 

00:28:30
DANIE BEAULIEU So I told him the story that it's gonna keep smelling. What, I asked him, "Do you think by leaving the bag shut," and it helps if you do have the smelly bag next to you in your office, it really helps. 

00:28:45
RICH SIMON You, you keep reminding us of that. Okay. I believe you. 

00:28:50
DANIE BEAULIEU And so you ask your client, "Do you think over time it will smell better or worse?" I mean, everybody has the answer to that even if you are working with a five-year-old. So instead of you trying to shake your client and say, "Come on, spill out the thing," you know, uh, in this case here, they are telling you "Okay, I have something that smells inside, and I know for a garbage bag, you know, when it smells, over time, it only smells worse. So, I mean, I understand that you should not open it up with everyone, cuz god, it's gonna smell terrible, but I, I had the surgery for not smelling, so I'm probably the right person, the best person you can talk to about this." And if it does not work during that specific session, usually they think about it and when they come back they're relly, really ready to open the garbage bag and, and let out whatever guilt or, uh, shame they may have. A small, uh, funny story about that. I was, I had my son who's now 19, but he was then 15 or something, and, um, we were working together during the summer, he was with me, you know, when I was teaching, he was selling my books and stuff. And, uh, so we were in the hotel room sleeping, you know, 15 minutes, you know, I thought, I thought, he was, uh, sound asleep, and, um, suddenly I hear, it was totally dark. You have to picture the room. And it was totally dark, and I hear a, "Mom?" "Yes?" "You know the gold chain you had with the heart?" "Yes?" "I gave it to my girlfriend when I was in fifth grade." You know, can imagine, I was totally in the dark and there he goes with that story. I said, "Son, uh--" He said, "I apologize, mom, I'm gonna pay you back." I said, "Son, I, I am really grateful that you were honest enough to tell me the truth about this, but how, I do not remember having had a, any kind of gold chain with a heart, so for this time, I forgive you, but make sure that next time you get something from my stuff, that you ask me before." He said, "I promise." So I think of that, I thought about it, and knowing his genes, I said, "Are there anything else, you know, that you probably have in your garbage bag?" And he said, "Well, once I took $20 from you." "$20? Where did you get $20 from?" And he told, he told me a couple of things that he had in his garbage bag. Rich, can you imagine that all these years, it was between me and him, and every time I was offering him a gift, he was feeling, uh, cheap, because he knew he had stolen something from me, and it, it was experience in terms of anxiety for him. So I'm saying helping clients to get rid of their guilt and shame is often the best thing we can do to heal anxiety, so to me, this is definitely something I am looking for, and especially in children and in adolescents. 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON Okay, great. Let's, let's keep, keep with our shopping list here. So this is, these are, these are all different-- So in your head when you're, when someone's coming into your office, specifically when they have anxiety symptoms, this is, you're listening in these, uh, in these different ways, where do we go here. 

00:32:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Yes, yes, and there's also, um, I mean I put it in the GPS, but I also have another, like, people will probably see on their handouts, there's also another circle that is specifically dedicated to thinking, but the reason why I'm putting some of it into the, um, uh, into the GPS circle, it's because there is a, um, a choice of deciding which attitude we take in relationship with whatever events that happen to us, and sometimes the GPS is saying, "I don't think you're taking the right path here." Right? Um, so, um, I, I will, you know, present to my clients different ways of, uh, what, one of the, one of technique that I like, you, can you that? 

00:33:45
RICH SIMON Is that from the 19th century? My god, is that what I think it is? 

00:33:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Uh, what I'm saying is-- 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON A Model-T Ford is marked right outside your hotel, eh? 

00:33:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, but, Rich, the -- but Rich, precisely when people look at that, they go, "What is this?" You know, especially for teenagers and, and younger children. They go, "What is this?" You know, it's associated to something very old, something you no longer use. Don't you think this is a great device to, uh, a great metaphor, to represent how sometimes you have these old patterns that you still use in your head. You know, if you, if you get to, uh, this, uh, get back to this Crocodile Dundee stuff. And we look at this beautiful journalist when she's back in New York, right? Do you think when she's gonna go for a walk in Central Park that she's gonna stop by the little lake there and, you know, just spread some water in her face? Chance are, because she was so heavily traumatized in the outback, even though she knows there are no crocodile in Central Park, she may start thinking, "Oh, in case. Oh, I shouldn't. Oh--" And that could be a great device to say, "Well, this is an old, very old tape, some people are carrying it for years." For, for 10 years, 20 years, even more, as you know, so this is great to have this kind of device and say, "Why don't you leave it in my office? I mean, you don't need to take it back at home with yourself if you don't, if you no longer need this." 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON So, so then, as you were, as you were, um, going down your list, we, we had these four different, uh, contexts, four different ways of, uh, understanding. So now the cassette, is that a mode of thinking about all of them? Is that more in the technique category? Or is one of these five, uh-- 

00:35:55
DANIE BEAULIEU No, no. Well, I was saying that, uh, well no, yes. But in a way, I, I was telling you that I put the thinking that we choose to, um, to think, uh, depending on the different events that we see or, uh, and I put it in, part of it in the GPS, because, again, um, the client has the choice to pick one attitude over the other, one thinking over the other. So the GPS is saying, "Hey, you're not taking the right attitude." So, um, it's, it's, I'm trying to make sure the client has the power over his anxiety, and if you put it in the GPS is becomes like, uh, a service, it becomes like a, a big help to, um, help you understand what's going on inside of you. So, uh, this is, yes, I put it in as a fifth category of the, of the GPS. There is a-- 

00:37:00
RICH SIMON What's the label for it? Is this sort of "outdated beliefs"? Is it, uh, attitudes that don't serve you any further in the present that are rooted in the past? How, how do you language it? 

00:37:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Um, I like your titles better than mine actually. I should start changing my... yes, both of them, I agree, but that would be something, something around that, yes. There's another one, Ed, uh, I'm sorry, I don't know why Ed is coming up in my mind all the time. I have another story with him, but I'll come back later with that. Um, there is another, um, let's say, we put it as a sixth category. Um, food. 

00:37:40
RICH SIMON Food. That's interesting. 

00:37:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Food. I mean, this is the most direct link to your mood. Let me give you a convincing example. If you eat some food that, that is toxic to you, where it is not good for you, your GPS will say "Get it out of my system." Let me give you an example. I had this teenager coming for anxiety, he had a problem with anxiety, and his heart was beating and, and he could not concentrate, and you know, he was really not being able to sleep and stuff. I had the idea to ask him if he was drinking coffee. Well, believe it or not, with his friends, he was going to this garage station, where you can buy the, uh, uh, um, what's it, vanille francais, french vanilla. French vanilla. It's like a nice hot, um, hot chocolate, but it's coffee. It's coffee. 

00:38:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, coffee, but it's, but it's-- 

00:38:50
DANIE BEAULIEU And he was drinking these big, you know, two, three french vanilla. That was the problem, Rich. I mean, we could've done a big, major therapy for years, you know. But he stopped drinking the french vanilla and that really stopped his problem. So anxiety, well, it was not really anxiety, it was not, it was just a, an answer response from his body that is very similar to anxiety, so it's easy to call it anxiety cuz it's the same symptoms really. The heart is beating and my head is spinning. I can't sleep, I can't breathe, uh, but it was really, uh, coffee, so this is one of the thing. The other thing, okay, number seven now, number seven, hormones. 

00:39:45
RICH SIMON Mm, okay. 

00:39:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Do you know anything about that? 

00:39:50
RICH SIMON I, I, I've heard rumors about hormones. 

00:39:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Hormones, Rich, should be roughly investigated because again I mean you can try to find a problem in your mother, in your job, in your spouse, in your life, you can change everything and you still have the same problem because your problem is hormone. And so I will, in, in order to pinpoint that hormone is the problem, is the etiology, I have my clients, women, of course, and teenagers, um, more and more, I have them observe themselves. When do you experience anxiety? And if it is something that is, uh, from a hormonal, uh, issue, um, it will be at specific time during the month, and so if we discover that this is what happen, I'm gonna refer them to their gynecologist, and stop coming to see a psychologist. You're problem is, is a gynecologist. So, uh, this is really something, I mean, I do not have any percentage, percent to offer in terms of this is 50% or 30%, but I suspect it's a high percentage of, uh, anxiety on women and, uh, teenagers. 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON And men? So you're, what you're saying about food I guess would extend to lifestyle, people aren't sleeping, they're not getting enough exercise, their physiology is out of balance, so within that, uh, category is what you're saying is food, is there kind of a bord, a border character of gener-- lifestyle and perhaps general wellbeing related to people coming in and then giving it a psychological reading. This must be, have something to do with some psychological issue, and what you're saying is perhaps not. Maybe this... 

00:41:55
DANIE BEAULIEU Perhaps not. Perhaps not. And, and, and I have a last, uh, a last one under, um, GPS, which, you know, I, well, the, the last one is more difficult, Rich. It is associated to the fact that we have, um, oh, how can I say that in English. Life is too fast. The GPS is saying, "Hello, I'm sorry, you're not respecting my rhythm." I mean, uh, you remember this, uh, wonderful, uh, Jim Lore that you invited as a keynote eventually, at the, uh, I still use his knowledge. I mean, when he says you could, you should imitate the, the waves, you should imitate the heart. That is, one convincing example that I do for these people, I have them hold their, um, their bones here, you know, and I say, "Okay, breathe in." And don't breathe out. Breathe in again. And don't breath out. Breathe-- Eventually, they can no, no longer breathe. What I'm saying is if you work and work and work and have no time to rest, eh, the power of full engagement is associated to the power of full disengagement, and the more you are able to disengage, the better you will be at fully engage, right? I think it is a very powerful lesson, and, uh, nowadays, we're, uh, you know, imitating what Japanese call the karoshi. You know what the karoshi is? It's something that exists only in Japan. It is, you know, you work, you work, you work and, poof, you die. 

00:43:50
RICH SIMON When they just die. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:43:55
DANIE BEAULIEU And this was the second, uh, cause of death in Japan. I mean, you just don't stop working, so you die. And I think we're getting more and more into that, especially American, you are at higher risk, uh, so, uh, I am trying to do some teaching here to, to them to let them, you cannot be Superwoman, you cannot be a Superman. Uh, I had this lady calling me and it was exactly the kind of, of situation for her. She has three boys. The oldest is five. Yes, and, uh, she's a psychologist. 

00:44:40
RICH SIMON Busy lady. 

00:44:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Yes, and, uh, she, uh, she wanted to get back to work. I mean, for five years, she really stopped her career because, you know, she was pregnant, raised kids, and, and then she wanted to go back to work, so she went back to the community center where she was working. She started seeing, uh, having a private practice in the evening, uh, doing her report over the weekend. She called me, she said, "Danie, Sunday nights are so difficult for me because I start feeling anxious, and I don't sleep, and I tight, and I--" Well, I said, uh, "It's a good news. You're trying with your head to say, ‘I should go to work. I should have a career. Everybody do it,' but, uh, I'm telling you, Genevieve, uh, you, your body's telling you, 'I'm sorry, I can't do it.' And, and the anxieties, your GPS giving you a great notice, uh, sorry, but it's, your rhythm of life is not respecting your, your, where you are in your life. Another convincing metaphor is I have one of these wonderful, uh, one of these wonderful songs, you know, that, whatever, I try to adapt the songs to the client I have in front of me, and, and-- 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON You do musical interventions. I've heard of these before. 

00:46:10
DANIE BEAULIEU Yes, right. And, and so, um, when, uh, they, they start listening to the song, the song is playing in the right rhythm and the right beat, and it's great and enjoyable, and eventually, I start accelerating with my computer. And it becomes, ooh, you know, you don't wanna listen to it anymore. And I'm saying, is it possible that your own tune, your own song is, you know, getting on everybody's nerves as well just because you're not respecting your own rhythm? I mean, if you do respect your rhythm, it's wonderful, because you feel at peace with yourself, with the world. You can really give the best of yourself. But if you try to, you know, turn on the speed, you're getting on everyone's nerve, and it's, it's no longer fun. I'm telling you that. So this is-- 

00:47:05
RICH SIMON This is great. So all right, so you, so as a, then as a, um, as a, uh, uh, as a therapist who's trying to get his grasp and listen closely to what clients are telling you, you can, uh, what appears like anxiety has very different roots, and, and sometimes it's very immediate, it's very much in people's diet, their lifestyle, their pace, perhaps it's in their hormones, often it's more existential. Their sense of direction, their mission in life. So you're trying to listen to all these things. Now, so let, let's shift a little bit. We have about 15 minutes left here. So as a, given this, so a big part clearly of what you do and what you offer your clients is just that kind of listening, and your ability to help them to refocus and grasp their life in different ways. So as you think of what it is that you do that has impact, and you are, uh, uh, of course, a master of impact therapy, so what are the, are there certain interventions in addition to the very powerful kind of reframing that you've been describing here, and you've already told us about our very memorable garbage bag which we will not, not of us will soon forget, are there any other kind of interventions that, when you in your practice and your training, that you find especially helpful for any of these varieties of anxiety that you'd like to share? 

00:48:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Oh, plenty. Plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty. Um, let me offer a few of those that of course depending on the cause, uh, will vary from one client to the other. One, I wanna make sure I give to the people listening to this is this, uh, do you see that? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Here we are, here, what, over here. 

00:49:00
RICH SIMON There you go. 

00:49:00
DANIE BEAULIEU An old telephone. You see this? An old telephone. So I am I'm, I mean, I don't know how it is, how is the situation for you, but for me, and for most people here, we receive a lot of telemarketing calls, trying to sell you all kind of stuff. Do you get those? 

00:49:15
RICH SIMON Oh yeah. 

00:49:15
DANIE BEAULIEU And it's difficult to filter. 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON They call the house. That's the only, that's the only thing that keeps the phone business alive, yes. 

00:49:25
DANIE BEAULIEU So, um, we cannot always filter these calls. Most of people don't want to listen to these telemarketers, right, but you cannot filter the calls, except that you can decide how much time you wanna spent on the phone with them. I like to use that, um, because most people have the experience. It is associated to some kind of frustration. "Why don't you-- How come, how do you dare taking some of my precious time!" Right? So they do have that experience inside of them, therefore I'm telling them there's someone else taking some of you precious time. There's a part of you, you know, when I told, when I explain my cycle of anxiety, I said there is one other circle where you get this imprint definitely change your master programs and you can no longer get into the car because you had a car accident. And even if there's, the more, the more evolved program inside of you saying, "Oh, I know, it's not because I'm going in a car, I'm gonna have an accident again," or this lady from Crocodile Dundee, it's not because, you know, I had this problem in outback, in the outback of Australia that I'm gonna have a crocodile here in Central Park. She knows it, but she gets the call, right? Be careful, yeah, maybe a crocodile at Central Park. So once you identify the origin, it comes from my limbic system. Thank you very much. The limbic system wants to ensure your survival. Thank you, I'm not gonna die in Central Park. There are no crocodiles here, so goodbye. And hang it up, the damn conversation. The problem is most people keep listening, yeah, well you're right, maybe there is. Well, are you sure there is? There probably isn't. Are you sure? But, and they keep having the conversation with their limbic system. Hang up the phone. So, just, teaching the people where the call comes from, uh, and telling them you have the right to hang up the conversation with that. And kids love it, um, you know, it's like there's Dr. Schansky, that I like very much, Dr. Schansky. Uh, she was comparing the, um-- 

00:51:50
RICH SIMON Dr. Schansky is a media psychologist? Who's Dr. Schansky? 

00:51:55
DANIE BEAULIEU She's a psychologist working with children. She want, she wrote a couple of wonderful books, uh, Tamara Schansky is her first name. And, um, so she said, she compares these thoughts to, uh, junk mail, you know? I mean, if you start opening the junk, you probably receive more and more, so don't open up. Put it directly into the garbage. You know? It's, it's, uh, so for teenagers and kids, it's a great metaphor to just understand whatever comes from previous, um, fear or from this old tape or from, you know, just throw it in the garbage. You don't need to open up all this junk mail. 

00:52:40
RICH SIMON It, it's not some magical communication from some deep source of wisdom, it's just a robocall. Okay. 

00:52:45
DANIE BEAULIEU That's right. 

00:52:45
RICH SIMON Keep going! So there are others, these are great tools. Other, other kinds of, um, tools you use in...? 

00:52:50
DANIE BEAULIEU Yes, but I, I just had another thought, Rich. Uh, something that I forget to, to, to mention, and I think it's very important to mention. I believe that everybody who has problems with anxiety has eventually lied a lot. And I think this has to be addressed by the therapist. Let me give you an example. Um, what this would be related to the first point under GPS, that is, repressed fear. Okay? But let me give you an example. Um, the lady is going out with this wonderful new man. And, and, um, she's has the worst fear of water. Now there he is, creative, deciding to invite her in, uh, on a boat for a wonderful, romantic dinner. She doesn't want to say that she's anxious around water, so she tries to hide that and therefore she starts inventing, lying, creating all kind of pretext to, you know, uh, justification not to go, but eventually the more you, uh, go with that, the deeper you go into having in the mirror a picture of yourself as a huge, big liar. And it can be such a relief when the therapist just mention that typically someone who has problem with also with drug and alcohol, but also anxiety, and I don't think it is so well known, that, you know, just to mention typically there's a lot of lies around anxiety. Mention that to client, so that they feel, okay, I can open the garbage bag and say that I've been a big liar all this time. It's a relief, you know, it cleans up the bag, and it stops smelling around these people. So I, I wanted to make sure I, uh, I mentioned that. 

00:55:00
RICH SIMON And the lying is specifically is trying to disguise the anxiety itself. So it gets so it's tangled, you get tangled up in your own, uh, uh, cycle of having the anxiety and then being more anxious because you're misrepresenting yourself. 

00:55:20
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah. Okay, I know you want some more techniques before we close this, uh, session, this webinar. Okay, um, I like this. THis is a bag with some, uh, pieces of, uh, um, puzzle, right? Have you seen that? 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Okay, hold it. Oh, jigsaw puzzle, okay. 

00:55:40
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, it's, uh, you call it puzzle? 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Well, jigsaw puzzle. Uh, puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle. But yeah. 

00:55:45
DANIE BEAULIEU A jigsaw puzzle, okay? Okay, I like to show that to my clients to say, you know, when we're born, we're born with a bag like this, and all the pieces, you know, oh, all the pieces are, um, um, how can I say. Personality traits or temperament or something that is with you. You're born with it, you're gonna die with it. You know, hopefully it's good news. And, but the box is not included. You know, it means, you don't know what kind of, you know, you just get the pieces one by one, say, "Wow, I wonder what kind of puzzle we gonna, what kind of picture we gonna have at the end." So then therefore until you know most of your pieces, you try to be someone you're not. Like, let me give you an example again. I had this teenager, um, he wanted to be play, uh, soccer with his friends, you know, and he was going, I was going to watch them play, so now I'm gonna play with them, you know, and, uh, the problem is he doesn't have the piece of soccer in his bag. It was not included in his bag. I mean, he still has nothing to do with sports. I mean, he's terrible with sports. He's a violinist for christ's sake. What was he doing playing soccer? So of course he's terrible, and it makes him anxious because now there's a game tonight, am I gonna play, am I gonna be good? Whenever you try to be someone else than who you are, you feel anxious, again, because your GPS is saying, "Hello, go get your violin and get out of here." Right? And, uh, so this is a great example. I like to tell my clients maybe you're trying to put in the bag a piece that is not there, or you're looking for a piece that is not there. Many parents are actually asking their kids to find the sport piece in the bag, or find the musician piece in the bag, okay? Cuz otherwise you won't be accepted in this family. I'm sorry, but, um, he doesn't have it. And if he doesn't, and he thinks he should have it to please either his parents, the world or his friends or his schoolteacher, he's gonna start experiencing anxiety. You see, for me again it is a friend. I'm trying, the metaphor I am creating is to illustrate how anxiety is not a, a threat, a, a traitor. How do you say that? It, it, it is a friend. It is telling you please just be your, and it's plenty, and it's good enough, and you don't have to be anybody else to please anybody else. So this is another great metaphor. Um, okay, let me-- 

00:59:00
RICH SIMON Let me ask you, so if you have a, a, maybe one more of these. So let me just put this in a, so as I, as, uh, uh, I hear this, and, um, so if I'm, if I was watching you in your office with all your wonderful props and your very lovely animated style. So sometimes you're coaching folks, sometimes you're more in a, a, a more what we think of at least as a more traditionally therapeutic role of you're moving into their childhood history, perhaps, and finding something, some need or some issue coming through in childhood and tracing it back and seeing how it's popping it. So as you put your role together and you give us, and you kind of stand back and see yourself, how would you describe your style, how you integrate together what sounds like you have a, quite a, a, a wide, an impressively wide range of styles and ways that you, uh, approach these issues in your office. 

01:00:05
DANIE BEAULIEU Well, it all comes to my understanding of how human being evolve, change, learn, grown. It has to go through the different multi sensory modalities. They got to take it, take the information by the eyes, by their body, by, not only their ears, so therefore if you would be in my office, uh, not only me, but my clients, they move around. Cuz I want the body to talk. The body has a, it's a big warehouse of information that the words have no clue about. And the body doesn't know how to lie, and it doesn't talk with words. Same thing with the visual. You know, like, I don't know if we can see that. Let me show you something. You see this? You see this? You see these too? Okay, so we have different holes, right? Different openings, right? So I can ask people, um, we are now at the end of our show, right? The end of our webinar? 

01:01:25
RICH SIMON We have a few minutes, but this looks like a great finale, so whatever you have in mind... 

01:01:30
DANIE BEAULIEU So, these represents the different openings, right? Of your mind related to the tools I have to offer. For instance, some clients have this one. They're not listening. They don't wanna know anything. Some people have this one. See, they take it in about everything. Some people have this one, where there's not much that is going, uh, going inside of them. So I think if you go with the verbal, just the verbal, and if you try to engage all the modalities, you get much better results. So, yes, I am some kind of productor, I produce, some, uh, uh, I'm a mental health sign, really, where, I create this, uh, uh, I try to recreate, actually, the life of my client with the small chairs, the big chairs, and they have to stand on a place or the other, and the props that we put on it and the little chair listens to this old corny tape, and, uh, you know. So it's, uh, it's fun, but it's not because it's fun that it's not efficient. I think it is very efficient, and most of my clients. No, I'm sorry, I have to say, honestly, all my clients, they leave the office thinking, God, I was really able to express what deep down I had to say. And take in what I had to share with them. I hope it is true for you too. 

01:03:05
RICH SIMON Well, I certainly, I, I have experienced in our conversation, I certainly get an idea of what your clients must experience in conversation with you. So, let's, let's take a few moments now to make sure that people for whom whatever, the, uh, the, for whom you were the, uh, a multichannel, uh, source of delight and entertainment and information, useful clinical information, how they might follow up with you. Training opportunities? Where do they go to find out more about your work, this kind of multi-sensory approach, impact therapy? 

01:03:40
DANIE BEAULIEU In July 2012, I am going to have a new website, but we, we have, I have a website right now, and people can go at daniebeaulieu.com or they can go at academyimpact. impactacademy.net. Um, and, uh, they will find some free material to download that they can use, in their practice. I'm trying to put as many of those as possible on my website. I'm also having three books in English. One is on these Impact techniques for psychotherapists, about 300 examples, uh, it was published at Roblage. And there's also one in the classroom, but it, people get confused, it's, I should've picked a better titles. something like Impact Techniques for, for, um, kids and teenagers, really. Whatever they face in school about motivation, respect, discipline and, and stuff, so there's one in English on that, Impact Techniques in the Classroom, published by Crown House. Then I have this, um, specialty on eye movement integration, which is, uh, uh, eye movement treatment that is, uh, wonderful using 22 different movements in different directions. And this book is in English as well and published at Crown House. So all my workshops are, uh, announced on my website, uh, if you go under international agenda. I'm teaching a lot in Europe. Um, couple of months per year in Europe. Teaching some in the states wherever I'm invited, and then I'm at the Networker quite often. And, um, so, um, this is how people can catch up with all these ideas. 

01:05:25
RICH SIMON And you, and you speak how many languages? 

01:05:30
DANIE BEAULIEU A few. Definitely some French and some German and some Spanish. And English. 

01:05:40
RICH SIMON So you're, so you're, and so yeah, you're really presenting-- and, and, and you present in addition to the Networker, you present in the United States, uh-- 

01:05:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Yeah, different conferences. I'm gonna be at AAMFT this year. I'm gonna be at, I'm teaching regularly for Montreal Conference. I'm teaching for other associations as well, so, um, it's always a pleasure to be invited. 

01:06:00
RICH SIMON Okay. So, uh, again, invitation to those of, uh, you who are listening here, that you've listened to this multisensory conversation: the Danie Beaulieu show, and quite a show it is. Uh, and, uh, so if you are as engaged as I was, you may well have some observations to make in the, uh, sense the watchword of the, of this hour is really engagement and involvement. Take the time in whatever mode you wish to communication this, uh, what stood out for you in the course of this interview. What questions do you have, what connections you make on the basis of what Danie had to say. What questions might you have, and Danie will be looking at our comment board. No guarantee she will respond each and every query and question, but I'm sure she'll be interested in hearing your response, and of always, the important thing is the conversation starts here, but it really continues with a ripple effect of all of us, uh, with taking these ideas that you've, uh, presented such an irresistible fashion, in such an engaging way. Uh, what, what fun to, uh, have this, this time to, uh, have this conversation with you, and to get a real sense of, you've presented at the Networker symposium many times, and this is, uh, this is the glory of this kind of video material, this kind of video media. I really get a sense of how you work and, and so it must be a lot of fun to be your client. I must say, in many ways. 

01:07:30
DANIE BEAULIEU Thank you, Rich. 

01:07:30
RICH SIMON Thank you so much, and, and it's really, just, a lot of fun to have this conversation with you. 

01:07:35
DANIE BEAULIEU Same for me. 

01:07:35
RICH SIMON Now, thank you to Danie and thank you all for being part of this, and we look forward to seeing you next time. Bye bye. 

01:07:45
DANIE BEAULIEU Bye. 

01:07:45
PSYCHOTHERAPY NETWORKER Your source for community, learning and excellence Thank you!
