JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson. 

00:00:40
PAT LOVE And I'm Pat Love. 

00:00:40
JON CARLSON And this is living love. And today's program is getting unstuck. 

00:00:45
PAT LOVE Michele Weiner-Davis, where were you last week? My husband and I got so stuck and I have to tell you, it was, I mean, really stuck. We were both digging our heels in and I was so convinced I was right and I was really, really adamant about it and we were stuck. 

00:01:05
JON CARLSON You know, there's times in my life that getting, being stuck is just a way of life. You know, I just can't make things happen. 

00:01:10
PAT LOVE Well I can't wait what she has to say about is this normal because I know I do, it seems like I'm going along really well and it can happen like that. It can happen very quickly and I was thinking gee, I started off with having a good day and now I'm stuck and how do I get out of it? And that's a big question. How do I get out of it? How do I get unstuck? And I really think she's going to give us cues how to do that. 

00:01:35
JON CARLSON She's really got some good ideas. The first thing she's gonna help us with is just defining what love is, kind of a love map and then she's gonna move on and help us learn some goals but the solution oriented goals or solution focused goals. 

00:01:50
PAT LOVE And you know what? I never thought about having goals for the relationship because I don't even think about that. I make goals every day at, but they're always work goals. I make three work goals every day but I never thought about making a goal for my relationship that day. 

00:02:05
JON CARLSON Well. 

00:02:05
PAT LOVE So I cannot wait to hear about that. 

00:02:05
JON CARLSON Wonder what would happen to our partners if we did that and that's what brings us on to the third thing she's gonna talk about. That's the power of one person in a relationship. 

00:02:15
PAT LOVE You mean if my partner changes, I'll be better? 

00:02:20
JON CARLSON You know... 

00:02:20
PAT LOVE If I get, how, how to get him to change? 

00:02:20
JON CARLSON I, somehow I don't think that's what she's going to talk about. I think it's a little different than that. And then finally, the last thing she's gonna do is to help us deal with change.

00:03:20
PAT LOVE I know, I'm not. 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN You set goals for a lot of things, but never for my relationship. I set it for my life, for our life together but not really pinpointing at where I want the relationship to be next week, next year, further on down the road. Never thought of it in that way. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN You're setting the goals for your relationship but they may have no idea of what goal it is that you're trying to set. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN I mean, we gotta set it together? 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN So, yeah. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN My problem comes when I have expectations that aren't met, uh, I sometimes don't react to that very well. 

00:03:50
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 3. Do you know how to please your partner? 

00:03:50
JON CARLSON Number three. Do you know how to please your partner? 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Do you please them romantically or do you please them in a way of how they wanna be treated? 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Are you willing to go that extra mile to please your partner? 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN They might think or we might think we know what we want but when someone gives it to you, it's not really what you wanted. 

00:04:15
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 4. Are you creative in your efforts to get the relationship unstuck when it's stuck? 

00:04:15
PAT LOVE Number four. Are you creative in your efforts to get your relationship unstuck when it's stuck? 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN I'm not creative any way. Well, we all having to be creative with our relationship. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Our world is moving so fast that, I mean, I'm exhausted before I even get out of bed because I know everything that need, that you need to do and I'm already tired. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Sometimes it takes a lot of different directions to try and find what works. 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN One 10 year old, two in diapers, two dogs, a cat. It's... 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. So sitting down here right now is relaxing. It's three, you know, it's a couple hours without all the chaos. 

00:05:00
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 5. Do you continue to solve problems in the same way even though it never works? 

00:05:00
JON CARLSON Number five. Do you continue to solve problems in the same way even though it never works? 

00:05:10
PAT LOVE Oh, I'm so guilty. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) usually. That's usually what I do and it usually doesn't help. 

00:05:20
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 6. I am very good at understanding what my partner wants? 

00:05:20
PAT LOVE Number six. I am very good at understanding what my partner wants. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN It's, it's just the same old, you know, men say it is impossible to please a woman. No, it's almost impossible to please a man. 

00:05:35
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 7. I would rather be right than happy in my relationship. 

00:05:35
JON CARLSON Number seven. I'd rather be right than happy in my relationship. 

00:05:40
PAT LOVE I have to raise my hand. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:05:47
UNKNOWN Yeah, you can go (inaudible ). 

00:05:50
PAT LOVE (inaudible ). But what if I am right? 

00:05:52
JON CARLSON (inaudible ). 

00:05:55
PAT LOVE I know. But I am. Maybe on, on my tombstone, you know, she was right. 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN That's what our thing is. We're, we're always well, who's right? You're right, he's wrong. She's wrong. I'm right and the, like you said earlier, there really isn't a right and a wrong with everything. You just have to learn to work together. 

00:06:10
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 8. I believe it is important for my partner to change for us to be happy. 

00:06:10
PAT LOVE Number eight. I believe it is important for my partner to change for us to be happy. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN So I know that I have to change but I wouldn't want him to change for anything. 

00:06:25
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 9. It is easier for me to see problems as opposed to solutions? 

00:06:25
JON CARLSON Number nine. It is easier for me to see problems as opposed to solutions. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN You just, I get so wound up in everything that's going on and every, so much is disarray that, uh, I, I can't slow down to figure out the solution. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Or we come up with entirely different solutions. It's 180 degree, degrees apart and, uh, we need to work on that I believe. It's not recognizing the problems. It's how do we solve the problem. 

00:06:55
Getting Unstuck Quiz (Yes or No) 10. All problems should be solved at all costs? 

00:06:55
PAT LOVE Oh, wow. Number 10. All problems should be solved at all costs. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN That's, this is my philosophy. If I see someone look at me cross eyed, I wanna know why. You know, it's one bump in the road and I want it to be straight. That is one of my problems. 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON You know, Pat, this is a different questionnaire. I think this is one that would be really helpful to take at the end of our meeting. 

00:07:25
PAT LOVE Very provocative. 

00:07:25
JON CARLSON And I bet there'd be some shifts in the answers and to help make that shift, let's invite Michele out to learn some more about how to get unstuck. Michele, Pat and I are really glad that you're here because we're stuck and we're so stuck, we don't even know what being stuck means. Could you help us? 

00:07:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well Jon, I know you're kidding because when you're stuck, honey, you know you're stuck. It feels really bad but I was listening, Pat, to what you were saying about how you and your husband were stuck and you were wondering is this a normal thing. We all have times in our relationships where everything is clicking, where you seem to be communicating better. You feel really close and connected and then there are the other times. We all have times of conflict. That is completely normal and that's not what I'm talking about when I say really getting stuck. In my mind, getting stuck means that you're having the same argument over and over and over again for long periods of time. It's around the same issue and you never seem to go anywhere and it starts to really destroy the bond between two people because you feel so helpless. Like, is there a way out of this mess and there is a way out but you really have to start to do things differently, as you were suggesting, in order to work your way through and come around the other side. 

00:08:45
PAT LOVE Yeah, because I, I have to say, when I was in that place, it felt like there was no other, there was no way out. That was when I felt so hopeless. 

00:08:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) That's right, that's right. 

00:08:50
PAT LOVE And so upset and, and yet so committed to my position. I was just... 

00:08:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Right. Well, and I bet you anything that I'm right about this. You knew your position really, really well but I bet you, you also knew your husband's position really, really well. 

00:09:05
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:09:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You could have argued his point 'cuz you've done it before. 

00:09:10
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) Exactly. 

00:09:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You know, sometimes I think with couples, they know their arguments so well that they, they don't even have to do them. They can say honey, let's do argument number seven tonight. 

00:09:15
PAT LOVE Right, right. Right. 

00:09:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You know? Because, because they've been there, done that. It's all about being creative and breaking through those patterns that really makes relationships work. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON Why do people keep doing these things that don't work? 

00:09:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) It's crazy isn't it? 

00:09:30
JON CARLSON I mean, it seems like over and over again. Maybe I'll do this same thing, what, another time? 

00:09:30
Michele Weiner-Davis 

00:09:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) You know, insanity has been defined as doing the same thing and expecting different results and yet we all do it. You know, the problem is, one of the reasons we do the same old thing over and over again, it's usually the most logical thing to do. So we do it but the truth is, just because it's logical doesn't mean that it's going to work and so I really want couples to know, to pay more attention to what they're doing and look at the results that they're getting, not, Pat, are they right but is it working? Am I feeling closer and more connected? 

00:10:05
PAT LOVE Wow. I, I need, I need to say this. Let me see if I got it because this sounds powerful to me personally. That just because it's logical doesn't mean it's going to work. 

00:10:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly. 

00:10:15
PAT LOVE See I often think well, logic. I mean, can't you see? This is logical. And I get so invested that I know the logic and I know it's right therefore it should work. But you, what you're saying if I'm hearing you, just because you're right, just because it's logical doesn't mean it might, it's gonna work in your relationship. 

00:10:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. Period. That's right. But I can tell you one more thing. I would also bet that your husband, if he were sitting here right now and you weren't, he'd say I know I'm right. I know she's wrong. 

00:10:45
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) He would. He would. 

00:10:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And that's what happens in relationships. It's the blame game. I'm right, you're wrong. If you change then I will change but that is a really, really long wait. So I teach couples not to wait because if you wait, it really makes you helpless and hopeless. The only thing you can do is sit around waiting for your partner to change instead of taking the initiative yourself to be the first one to tip over the domino and allow the solutions to emerge. 

00:11:10
PAT LOVE I'm gonna confess. Okay, okay. So when you say that, what, the old tape that goes through my head is why does it always have to be me? That's what I say to myself. 

00:11:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Why me? 

00:11:20
PAT LOVE Why me? Why can't, just one time, he come and make up or he make the overture, but always works. I know when I make the overture it always works but then I somehow want him to make the overture. 

00:11:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, the truth is no one would be the primary one to tip over the domino the first time all the time. It just doesn't work that way. What happens is, if you tip over the domino and you start to get positive feedback right away, which often happens, it is so incredibly rewarding that so many people have said to me, Michele why did I wait so long? Had I done this months ago, years ago, I could have avoided all this hardship and could have been closer. So it's just a matter of making the first move because you will reap the benefits many, many times over in a very short period of time. 

00:12:05
JON CARLSON But, but what, what's the first move? I mean, there's so many, the solutions aren't clear. I, I, I think I'm doing what is the solution. 

00:12:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well obviously you're not because if you're stuck, Jon, and, and we were joking around about this. 

00:12:15
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) Hello. 

00:12:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS For years. You may think you're right. 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON I got it. 

00:12:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And, and, and in fairness to you... 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:12:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS In fairness to you, I think what happens with couples, they get so deeply entrenched in the problems that they're having that, it's, you can't see the forest for the trees. The solution really lies right under your nose and that's what I'm gonna help you do is to really sort of sift through all the hard feelings and the blame game and all the you change first and kind of give them a brain wash of solution focused thinking so that they can begin to be a little bit more flexible and a little bit more creative when it comes to solving problems. 

00:12:55
JON CARLSON It's so hopeful knowing change is gonna be possible. 

00:12:55
PAT LOVE I know. It, uh, thank you for saying too what you just did, not only that change is possible but when I'm in the middle of it, I can't think of all the wisdom I have for other people. 

00:13:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. 

00:13:05
PAT LOVE I can't, you're right. I'm so caught up in my own picture in my head. 

00:13:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well you point out, Pat, the wisdom you have for other people. You're a therapist. A lot of people watching aren't therapist but everyone out there really is a relationship expert on their own but we just tend to focus on what isn't working in our marriages. 

00:13:25
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:13:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And for every person who's married, there are times that, not matter how tough things are right now, there are times that, for some very strange reason, things go better. We just ignore these times. We take them for granted and instead we just focus on what we're doing wrong. In addition to learning how to tip over the first domino, it really behooves people to spend some time thinking about those rare times when things are really going well and things are really clicking and asking themselves what they're doing differently during those times because whatever it is they're doing, if they do more of that, they won't have to, um, apply the same sort of strategies that we're gonna be talking about later today. 

00:14:00
JON CARLSON See, and I tend to see those as flukes. You know, things that aren't meant to be. 

00:14:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yes. 

00:14:00
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:14:05
PAT LOVE But what you're saying, again, is hitting me in a very powerful way because when, when things are going well, it's like, I sort of take it for granted. I don't, and, and, but I'm, I'm a problem finder. I'm a problem, it's like I'm a heat seeking missile, you know? I'm looking for what is wrong and not for what is right. 

00:14:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's the exact opposite of what I teach couples to do, to become solution detectives and I really understand that, you know, sometimes people think it's a fluke when things go right. Well, if you figure out why it happened, why the fluke happened, you do it over and over and over again, you turn a fluke into a pattern and then you have a completely new way of interacting with your partner and there's really, it's so simple and so easy to do. 

00:14:45
JON CARLSON But it's hard for me to, to, you know, get past the part that my partner's the one who really needs to change. 

00:14:55
Michele Weiner-Davis 

00:14:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah, well, we'll fix you Jon. By the end of the day here, we'll fix you. Um, you know, a lot of people do think that and that's what I said about the blame game. They cross their arms and they'll say oh I'm right. You're wrong and I'm not gonna change. 

00:15:05
JON CARLSON What can I do if she won't? 

00:15:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS She will. 

00:15:05
JON CARLSON Oh. 

00:15:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS As long as you really, you can affect change in your relationship singlehandedly. I talk about it takes one to tango, but the trick is in figuring out new and more creative way, ways of approaching your spouse so that she wants to change. You can't make her change but she will want to change when you approach her in new ways. 

00:15:25
JON CARLSON This is kinda like using honey rather than vinegar maybe, huh? 

00:15:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS A little bit. A little bit. 

00:15:35
JON CARLSON Um, can, can you, um, talk about how we create this vision or this direction in our marriage? I mean, I think I'm almost so stuck in dealing with the day to day problems that I don't have any larger focus on where the relationship is going. 

00:15:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, we oftentimes as Pat you were saying, focus so much on what isn't going right and we feel those feelings and you really get stuck there and it's so important rather than focusing on what isn't right or focusing on the past, which people are really experts on doing, to really focus on the future, to get a vision of where you wanna be a week from now, a month from now, six months from now, a year from now, five years from now and really begin to address in a very specific, concrete way the way you'd like to be interacting and connecting to your partner because once you do that, you can break it down into small chunks, you really can identify what you need to do on a weekly basis to make those dreams materialize. I mean, Pat I heard you say you do it for work all the time. 

00:16:30
PAT LOVE I do it for work all the time. 

00:16:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS It works, right? 

00:16:35
PAT LOVE It really does work. 

00:16:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, you people can use that same sort of strategy. If you talk to people who are successful in business or any other walk in life, they basically, they have a vision of where they want to be because if you aim at nothing, you'll hit it every time and so one of the most important things of knowing where you're going is having an end goal so you know when you're getting there. 

00:16:55
JON CARLSON I'm clueless. I mean, you know, I read all these books and how do they all end? And they lived happily ever after but I don't have an idea what happily ever after looks like. 

00:17:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, that's one of the things we're gonna be talking about today. If you identify what I refer to as solution oriented goals, not vague goals, not sort of half-baked goals but goals that have within them seeds to solutions, what you need to do five minutes from now becomes very, very clear. We'll help you, Jon. We really will. 

00:17:20
PAT LOVE But you know, I'm still wanting, because I would like to think that we're never gonna be stuck again and I know better. We, we why do we keep doing these things that don't work over and over again? 

00:17:35
Michele Weiner-Davis 

00:17:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, I'll tell you. Maybe this will help you understand this a little bit more about human nature. You know, I was a psych student when I went to college and every psych student has the opportunity to run rats through a maze to find a piece of cheese at the end of the maze so we can learn how rats learn. Well, if you have a maze and it's got five different tunnels and you put the cheese down tunnel number four, initially the rat will explore all the tunnels looking for the cheese but soon it'll learn that it's down tunnel number four and it won't go to the other four tunnels. It'll go directly down tunnel number four each time but if you change the experiment and take the cheese from four and put it down one, initially the rat will go up and down four a couple times, looking for the cheese but when it notices that the cheese is not there, it'll start to explore the other tunnels. Now it's said that the only difference between rats and human beings is that human beings will go down tunnel number four for the rest of their lives because they'll tell themselves I know this is the right tunnel. I know I'm right. In fact, a friend of mine said that human beings will actually set out lawn chairs outside of tunnel number four waiting their entire lives for the cheese and we do this in our marriages. We go down cheeseless tunnels because we know we're right, because we don't wanna change but we're without the cheese and we're hungry and so it really behooves people to start to remember to identify their goals and then to make, be more aware of whether what they're doing is moving them closer to their goals or further away. And if it's further away, there are lots of other things that people can try so that they find their relationships more rewarding. 

00:19:10
PAT LOVE So all of my investment in being logical and being right is chasing a cheeseless tunnel? 

00:19:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You got it. 

00:19:20
PAT LOVE Going down, I'm gonna remember that picture. 

00:19:20
JON CARLSON Number four. 

00:19:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You got it. 

00:19:20
PAT LOVE It's behind door number four. And, but it's logical. It should be behind door number four but it's not. It's, uh, so that's... 

00:19:30
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) You're doing it for all the right reasons. 

00:19:30
PAT LOVE I'm doing it for the right reasons. 

00:19:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:19:34
PAT LOVE And I'm correct. It was there last time. It's not there this time. 

00:19:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly. 

00:19:35
JON CARLSON How do we clear our heads, though, to, you know, to move on to one of these other tunnels? You know, and you say... 

00:19:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Short of a lobotomy, you mean? 

00:19:40
JON CARLSON I was, I wasn't gonna rule that out. 

00:19:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, I think what needs to happen is, you know, they say that you, it's easier to break habits if you replace it with another good habit and so I think what's gonna happen here today is that I'm going to do the solution focus brain wash and so that people can begin to, uh, get some of those ideas that are keeping them stuck out of their minds and begin to replace them with ideas that will lead them to flexibility and creativity and more love in their lives. 

00:20:10
JON CARLSON It, it's really a whole different perspective is sounds like. That, that you're gonna ask us to look at our relationships very, very differently and you seem, you want us to see ourselves as though we're powerful. 

00:20:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) I, um, I hope so. 

00:20:25
JON CARLSON You want us to, uh, stop doing things that don't work. 

00:20:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Imagine that. 

00:20:30
JON CARLSON You, you want us to pay attention to solutions rather than pay attention to problems. 

00:20:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. 

00:20:35
PAT LOVE And I like your suggestion that when it's working, look at what you're doing. 

00:20:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Right. 

00:20:40
PAT LOVE I'm, I'm gonna take that one home, I know because, I have to tell you, I don't pay attention. I just take it for granted during those times. 

00:20:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You must look a gift horse in the mouth. 

00:20:45
PAT LOVE Oh. 

00:20:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And I'll tell you too, when you say the importance, Jon, of focusing on solutions rather than problems, most couples, when they're stuck, you know what they do? They analyze their problems to death. They try to figure out the cause of the problem and a lot of time they analyze the past. Like, for example, a woman might decide that the reason that they're having marital problems is because her husband is repeating the patterns that he saw growing up in his own family but I will tell you something. I have never met a man who, when a woman turns to him and says honey, the reason we're fighting all the time is because you're just like your father, the man, I've never met a man who says thank you for pointing that out, dear. I'm gonna have to work on it. Analyzing things to death isn't going to get you anywhere. It really isn't because you very rarely find a consensus between you and your partner. It doesn't give you a springboard to solutions at all. Focusing on the future rather than the past is a place that perhaps you both can agree on and begin to move forward. 

00:21:40
JON CARLSON Yeah, I suppose if they do agree, yeah, that's great. Then what? You know? You're still stuck. 

00:21:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS If you do agree on. Yeah, even if you do come to a consensus on the problem. 

00:21:50
JON CARLSON You're just like your father. 

00:21:55
PAT LOVE It doesn't give you any ideas about what to do about it. 

00:21:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Now what do we do? Exactly. So you both, at least, misery loves company and there you stay. 

00:22:00
JON CARLSON Wow. This, this stuff sounds so simple but yet it, it doesn't feel, it just feels so different and it's like, uh, a whole different way of doing things. 

00:22:10
PAT LOVE It's a different way of thinking. First of all, I realize I'm learning, I can feel a shift just from thinking differently, thinking about solutions instead of the problem. Also, looking at when things are going right versus the problem. 

00:22:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly. 

00:22:25
PAT LOVE And not being such a problem detector as a what works detector. 

00:22:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Solution detector, exactly. 

00:22:30
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:22:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You know, and the other funny thing about that is, so often in relationships, we focus on what's wrong and we let our partners know what's wrong when research shows, without a shadow of a doubt that the best way to change a person's behavior or get them to do good things is to positively reinforce or rewards, compliment, be kind, when something is going well. In fact, you should catch your partner in the act of getting it right and bring on the fanfare. But that is not what we do when we're married. Not often enough. 

00:23:00
PAT LOVE And, you know, earlier you talked about the blame game and I, it, it's like a hair trigger for me. I hate to be blamed. I just, I have, I mean, no one likes it but I mean, it's almost like throwing a little gas on the fire and so, and I love to be told what I'm doing right and to be seen as doing it correctly or at least seen as trying, even if I'm not 100%, to acknowledge when I try. 

00:23:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Absolutely. 

00:23:25
PAT LOVE That just makes me wanna work harder. 

00:23:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You know, Pat, a few summers ago I had a group, it happened to be women. It could have been men and I asked them if you're, if you were not here and your spouses were, would your spouses say you're more critical or more complimentary and all the women said, hands down, they were more critical. In fact, one woman said to me, you know, I came home from work and my husband, they lived on a little farm, their, her husband had mowed two acres of grass and the only thing she commented on was the fact that there was small patches of grass under trees that he didn't get to. So she said honey, you missed the grass when he'd done two acres and we do this all the time. The best that you could have done is to give him a compliment about what he did and maybe the next time, because that would sort of encourage him, he'd pay a little bit more attention and maybe even get it right the second time. 

00:24:10
PAT LOVE Or get the little weed eater our yourself. 

00:24:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:24:20
PAT LOVE You did two acres. Listen, you get the piano. I'll get the stool. Okay. 

00:24:20
JON CARLSON I just envision this. I'm, I'm imagining going to a foreign country and all of the sudden being dropped there and saying now I've got to learn a whole new language and a whole new way of doing things. 

00:24:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You, you're right except you know what happens when you start being, when you start with solution oriented thinking, it, it really changes things rather quickly and it's so rewarding that you wanna do it more and more and when you do it more and more, more, it becomes a way of life. You really don't have to think about it quite so much. And so it isn't quite so hard, but it is different. Different isn't bad. I think different is good, especially when you're stuck. 

00:24:55
PAT LOVE I was gonna say, different would be welcomed after last week. 

00:25:00
JON CARLSON So we shouldn't visualize this as, uh, Sanskrit or anything like that? 

00:25:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS No. 

00:25:05
JON CARLSON We can look at it as... 

00:25:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS No. It's actually quite, quite English. 

00:25:10
JON CARLSON Well, this has been very, you know, interesting for me and one of the things we have here with us is we have a audience of couples and I'd really be interested in seeing what comments or questions they might have about what we've been talking about. 

00:25:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's great. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN I was just thinking about how in, um, our family relationship and in our relationship as a couples, sometimes I, um, almost feel it's more efficient to target what's wrong. Let's talk about it and get on with it and, uh, I don't know. The efficiency and, I think, the busyness makes it even more so a temptation to try and hit what's wrong and nail it down and, uh, go after it. It seems to be the smallest and most obvious and I keep thinking about efficiency as one of my temptations to go in that direction. 

00:26:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ah, efficiency. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS But what I talked about in the tape is, is what you're doing working andI imagine there's some, she's saying no already so... 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN And I'll agree with her. And I can agree with her. 

00:26:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Hello? You know? And so, you know, it, the truth of the matter is sometimes, you know, pointing something out and saying doing it different, do it differently might work and so you need to pay attention to the times that it works and continue doing that. But she's shaking her head no, that when you're nailing people, they get defensive. They get their feelings hurt. They get resistant and then you have to spend that much more time, sort of making up for everything that you're doing. I mean, usually it isn't how, efficiency comes from working smart and working smart means doing what works, paying more attention to your more effective moments and making that a way of life. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN Don't you feel it's kind of difficult to praise somebody, you know, instead of condemning them about doing something wrong, once you're, 'cuz the person that's, uh, doing the condemning usually is irritated by what's not been completely finished promptly, right? 

00:27:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Absolutely. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN So it's... 

00:27:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well you said isn't it difficult and I'll say yeah it's difficult. Staying in love is difficult. Whoever said this stuff was gonna be easy? You know, in order to have a really effective relationship and I'm going to be talking more about this, you can't always go by your feelings. Just because you're feeling a certain way doesn't mean you have to act on it. The most effective things, the thing that you can do sometimes is when you're feeling resentment is to show love. You ever see the bumper sticker, kids need hugs the most when they deserve them the least? Well, the same thing applies to your spouse. Sometimes you have to do things to bring you closer even if you're not in the mood, even if that's not what you feel like doing. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Talking about change and I believe people can change for a period of time but they always go back or fall back to the way they were. Is it possible to change forever or is it a constant battle uphill? 

00:27:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That is a really, really good question. You know, sometimes I think about the metaphor people expecting a car to go forever on one tank of gas. That's pretty crazy. In order to keep a car running, you have to keep putting gasoline into the car or it doesn't work. In relationships, if you get, if you do something that prompts a more loving response in her, the moment you stop doing it, she stops doing it. You both fall back into your old ways. What separates the winners from the losers are when you get off track, you say to yourself what do I need to do to get back on track and then you start doing it again because if you start doing it again, you'll get that more positive response again. It is, you have to constantly keep yourself on track and get back on track. 

00:28:35
JON CARLSON Michele, I think we're all ready. We're ready to learn. 

00:28:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Great. 

00:28:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. Can you start with our first activity and, uh, show us just how to define what love means? 

00:28:50
Getting Unstuck Exercise 1 Defining Love 

00:28:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I'm gonna try my best. 

00:28:50
JON CARLSON Thanks. 

00:28:55
[music] 

00:28:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, you know, the theme for the day is getting unstuck, right? But before I give you the secrets to getting unstuck, I'm going to tell you where I have seen thousands of couples get stuck and it all has to do with this one very small idea, how you define love. Now let me ask something, and answer honestly, okay? How many people think that in order to have a really good relationship, you and your spouse have to have the same definition of how, of what it takes to be loving? You have to agree on what it takes to really love each other and to feel loved in the relationship. Raise your hand if you think that, that you have to agree. There's a sort of maybe hand. And there's like maybe, another maybe. There's another maybe. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN I'd like it to be close but I don't think we, we're, men and women are too different. WE don't know how to do it the same way. 

00:29:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. So you would like it to be close but it probably, realistically isn't. Okay. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) I don't think it's possible. 

00:29:55
Getting Unstuck Defining Love List what your partner would say are the three things you can do that make him/her feel loved. 

00:29:55
Getting Unstuck Defining Love List three things your partner can do that make you feel loved. 

00:29:55
Getting Unstuck Please Pause here & write 

00:29:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS If you didn't raise your hand, think about this. Is there anyone sitting here who has ever said to him or herself, if you love me, you would feel fill in the blank or if you loved me, you would want to fill in the blank. I see some heads nodding. Okay, okay. Well what that means is you do, in your heart of hearts, believe that if two people love each other, they should think exactly the same way about what it takes to be loving and I see so many couples getting stuck there because, I'll tell you what, no two people feel loved in exactly the same way. It's just not possible. Where do we learn about love? We learn about love through out life experiences, when we were a child growing up we had experiences that made us feel loved and that's oftentimes what we're expecting or looking for when we get married. But the problem is our experiences are so different. In my family, I felt really loved by my mom 'cuz I'm really close to her and she's the kind of person that likes to talk a lot and ask me how I'm feeling and we really closely connect that way so when my husband and I got married 23 years ago, um, I had this notion that if I wanna feel close and connected to him, I'm going to ask him about his feelings and if he looks a little down I'm going to say honey, what's wrong 'cuz that's what my mom did to show love to me but guess what? My husband didn't respond that way. In my husband's family, on the other hand, his mom was super mom. They had five boys in the family. She loves to cook really great meals and their definition of love was sitting around the table, around food. So when we got married, he was expecting me to be a gourmet chef. Sorry to disappoint you, Jim, but it just didn't work that way. So we bring these expectations into our marriages. The problem is, we tend to give to our partners that which we want to receive instead of understanding our partner's definition of love. But that's not real giving. Real giving is when we learn what's important to our partners and we give what they want. We give what they need whether we understand it or not, whether we like it or not. We do it because we love them. That's what real giving is all about. We're about to do an exercise to sort of test your relationship IQ to see how well you understand, not your definition of love, but your partner's definition of love. But before you do, I'm going to tell you that I worked this exercise out in my own mind by practicing on my husband. The exercise is gonna go like this. You don't have to worry about it because I'll tell you about it in just a minute, but I tried to name three things. I tried to guess three things that I could do that would show love to my husband and I tried, and I was wondering whether he could do the same thing for me. So I thought about it and I said to myself, well, I know one thing for sure. My husband is a sex maniac. It seems to me like he always wants sex and, of course, if he were here, he'd tell you that I never want sex and the truth probably lies, well, closer to my point of view, of course. Um, and the other thing, of course, is, as you know, good food and the third thing is spending time together because he really likes to do that. And I was thinking about my own definitions of love. I love to spend time with him. I love to talk to him and I love when he does little things for me like brings me a cup of coffee or gets my car started when the weather is cold so I get right into a warm car. That really makes me feel loved. So I called him at work one day and I said Jim, I'm doing this exercise with couples. Tell me, what is it that I can do that will make you feel loved? And he said sex. I said got that one. He said good food. I said got that one. And then he said more sex. I said no, come on. Come on. And he actually got the third one and then I said how about me? What do you think you could do to make me feel loved and he said spend time together. I said that's it. And then he said no sex? I said Jim, come on. Be fair. And he actually got the other two right but the truth is, the reason that he got 'em right is because we spend a lot of time talking about what's important to us as a couple, what's important to each of us and we spend time doing real giving. So let's test your relationship IQ and I'd like for you and the people at , just because you're at home doesn't mean you're not gonna do work. You're gonna work here today. To answer the following questions. I want you to list what your partner would say are three things that you can do that will make him or her feel loved and I also what you to list three things your partner can do that will make you feel loved. And although it's tempting, don't compare notes now. Just do it on your own. Don't discuss your results just yet. You'll find out how you did later. 

00:34:40
[music] 

00:34:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, before you compare notes and before you at home compare notes, I thought we would ask a couple here to do a little sharing so you kind of get the sense of what this is supposed to be like and here we have a couple who's volunteered, so get rolling. Share your stories with each other and see how well you were able to guess what the other person's thinking about love. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN I almost wish this was a game show because I know we have it right because we've been down this road before. We've talked about different things, uh, the things that show her that, the things I could do that would show her that she's loved would be the hugs, the simple hugs, the simple touching, holding hands, stroking her, the little things. And then just good quality time together. 

00:35:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Well first of all, husband, did you see how she's nodding? 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. I, yeah., she... 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:35:41
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Bingo. 

00:35:41
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:35:43
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS All right. Well, that's a, that's a separate issue. It's first knowing. Let's stick with what you know. Okay? So the hugs and sort of gentle affectionate touching and what else did you say? 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN The little things. 

00:35:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS The little things. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN And some good quality time together. 

00:35:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, so give me an idea of the little things. What happens there? 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Uh, having her coffee made in the morning when she gets up. Uh, doing the dishes at night. Stuff like that. 

00:36:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS All right. And the little things and then spending time together. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:36:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Just really talking to each other? What do you do during that time that would make her feel loved? 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Uh, sharing my day with her but I think there's routine, ordinary, not very important. She likes me to talk about my, my time at work, my friends, what's going on. 

00:36:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Are you and I twins or clones or something? How did that happen? 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN I think just women. 

00:36:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah, I think, I think you're right about that. So how did he do. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN He was right. 

00:36:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS He was right? All three? 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Let me shake your hand. Good job. Good job. And, what, now talk about what she needs to do. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN See, the problem there is I'm almost 180 degrees. Don't give me the hugs. Don't caress me. Give me my peace and quiet, some time by myself. Just because I enjoy my own company. Not that I don't like hers, but I enjoy my own company. 

00:37:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) I understand. I understand. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN Um, and the time together. I do enjoy. That's probably one thing we are together on. That, that... 

00:37:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So you need a little more alone time but you do enjoy time together and the physical touching isn't, doesn't sort of ring your bell the same way it does for her? Okay. All right. Let's see how you did. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Well, for him, the first thing I said was give him peace and quiet, you know, especially when he comes home and time to unwind. And then have everything, you know, calm. We have six young kids in the house, so, uh. 

00:37:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Wow. Wow. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN So that's, I'm used to the chaos and activity and Si (ph) prefers a more calm time. So, so if the kids are downstairs or out playing and it's just he and I spending time together rather than everybody in the kitchen. 

00:37:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Right. Right. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN It's more enjoyable for him. And then the other thing was, um, to leave him alone when he's angry and give him that space. 

00:37:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS It's hard, isn't it? 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. And I think, but also, um, and, and it's funny because I'm (inaudible ). Everything for him is, like, distance and for me it's all contact but at the same time, when he does give me these, those hugs, it really means a lot because I know he's not doing it for himself. 

00:38:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN He's doing it for me. 

00:38:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's absolutely right. I know exactly what you mean. How did, so how did she do? 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Right, right on the head. 

00:38:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS She... 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

00:38:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. And how about for you? I had hugs and then the little things, then communication, getting phone calls and coffee. Things like that. 

00:38:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Were you guys, like, cheating by looking over the other person's writings? 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN No, no. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN We've talked about this several times before. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I did have one other thing. That's spending time with the family, including all the kids and everything. 

00:38:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Is that something you knew about? The importance of family time? 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)I know that's important. 

00:38:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You do know that? 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN I know it's important but we only had three things. 

00:38:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS But I didn't have four things, I had three things. Follow the exercise here, please. Um, so you didn't learn anything knew about each other but I guess what I need to know about you, how did you know how important it is to really be talking about these things with each other? 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Because I'm my usual standoffish self and she says come on, give me a hug. You know I like those things. They're very important. We, we've been down the road before, discussing what's important to her and I in turn tell her well, that's not my bag. I'm more into this. So we've discussed it and it's things we work on and, like she says, I give her a hug and go oh, you know, big deal but she likes it. 

00:39:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You guys, don't, don't you have to feel that he has to feel the same way about hugs as you do? I mean... 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN At, at first I found myself in the relationship, I was doing all the things I wanted. I put the little rose by his bed and I'd leave the little notes. 

00:39:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Or the Hallmark cards. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN And it was like, then I'm looking at my bedside and it's empty. You know, it's like wait a minute. I want this stuff. 

00:39:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. That's right. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN So, you know, then I really started realizing what I'm doing is giving him what I want. 

00:39:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. And now you guys are doing real giving, real giving and sometimes it isn't easy. Leaving him alone when you want to talk to him is hard. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah, it's hard. 

00:39:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Giving her a hug when that's the last thing on Earth you wanna do, and yet what are the benefits of doing real giving. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN We love a lot better. 

00:40:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah you do. Yeah you do. Well thanks for sharing that. Um, now it's time for all of you and those of you at home to share notes and talk about your, what you've come up with and see how well you've done. Good luck. 

00:40:15
Getting Unstuck Please Pause here and share 

00:40:20
[music] 

00:40:20
JON CARLSON Well, now that we're all back together again, I'd be interested in knowing how you did. 

00:40:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I'm just curious. How many people got three out of three? Raise your hands. We have our star couples. There's like a sort of three. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:40:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Kind of. Okay 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Five out of six. 

00:40:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS How about two out of three? 

00:40:35
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Five out of six? 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Five out of six. 

00:40:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I think I'm gonna have to change this little exercise and do, you know, the top 10 things, right? Um, how about, how many people got two out of three? 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN We did pretty good. 

00:40:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You did pretty good? How did that feel? 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN We're, we had more in common than actually, then we thought. 

00:40:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Is that right? Wow. Do you agree with that. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. I didn't think that he, I was surprised that he felt the same way, is starting to feel the same way about things that I feel. 

00:41:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Wow. 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN Is what I feel like from his answers. 

00:41:15
PAT LOVE Do you feel like his answers have changed over time? Okay. 

00:41:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Wow. How would that happen do you think? 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Um, probably a lot of screaming, yelling, hollering. Wake up. 

00:41:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So are you saying that he was understanding what your needs are pretty well or are you saying that he starts feeling more like you do? 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN I think, what I got from what he said is, um, and I just told him that during the break, is that I feel like he's beginning to feel the same as I do of how important family is as opposed to other things. 

00:41:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Wow. Wow. 

00:41:50
PAT LOVE Cool. 

00:41:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And what was that like for you to hear that from her? 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Uh, it's, it's, it's a nice feeling. It is. 

00:42:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN It's, uh, she's very persistent in, uh, making me understand and I'm catching on. Family is much more... 

00:42:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) You're a slow learner but you're getting there, right? 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Right. That's right. 

00:42:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah. Yeah. Well, persistence pays off for things that are as important as appreciating your family. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Well, like you guys said earlier, you're both from two different backgrounds. You don't know what one feels about the family 'cuz like, to me, family is the number one most important thing. Children are the most important thing and from his family background, that's not what he was shown or taught and so he, he's been fighting it quite a bit but I think with the two little ones, he's seeing really, I think he's seeing how much more important it really is than he thought it was. 

00:42:45
PAT LOVE That's wonderful. 

00:42:45
JON CARLSON So at one time, he wouldn't have been two out of three. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN Certainly not. 

00:42:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So not only are you growing closer in terms of the things that you value but it sounds like you're getting better at being tuned into what your partner needs and wants. Is that true? 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN I think so. 

00:43:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Good job. Good job. I didn't have a chance to talk with both of you. What did you get from doing this? 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN Uh, on both sets, uh, two out of three and, you know, there was one that we were able to identify but, uh, the, the words we used needed to be talked about a little bit 'cuz we did match up on those. 

00:43:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So you, you both got about two out of three? 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:43:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Did you learn something in the process? 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN It was a reminder to me of, um, maybe being intentional about a couple of things that are important to Connie. Um, planning them and, uh, doing them because I love her and I wanna emphasize it. So. 

00:43:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's what real giving is all about. Now you know it, so you have no excuse not to do it. You can't say, you can't plead ignorance anymore and I really think it's a great idea to take these sheets and the lessons that you've learned from them and post them somewhere as a reminder of things that you need to do on a daily basis that help your partner feel loved because you'll get it back in return. Promise me. Well, promise you. 

00:44:05
PAT LOVE One of the things I like about this, Michele, is the specificity. That, 'cuz when you said Hank that, oh, it was a reminder and I realize that in a given day, if I don't hear a complaint, I just tend to keep on doing what I'm doing. 

00:44:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS No news is good news? 

00:44:20
PAT LOVE Right. No news is good news. However, with this in my mind and planted in my mind, it gives me a little checklist in my own head to make sure that I meet my partner's needs. Otherwise, I just assume I'm doing great unless I hear a complaint. So it's really good to hear it in a positive way, what he wants. So that's one of the things I liked about it is it's a reminder but it's specific. 

00:44:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly. 

00:44:45
PAT LOVE Something that, okay, now that I know it, I can't plead ignorant anymore. 

00:44:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly. 

00:44:50
JON CARLSON It's kind of moving out of fantasy land into tomorrow land. 

00:44:55
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) Into reality. 

00:44:55
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:44:55
PAT LOVE That's right. Right. 

00:44:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) That's right. Exactly. 

00:44:55
JON CARLSON And we, we could move too. Uh, why don't we move on to the second activity. 

00:45:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Great. 

00:45:00
Getting Unstuck Exercise 2 Setting Solution-Oriented Goals 

00:45:00
JON CARLSON And that's gonna be showing us how to do solution focused goal setting? 

00:45:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. 

00:45:05
JON CARLSON Great. Can't wait. 

00:45:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Me too. Well, we talked a little bit about if you wanna get unstuck, you have to know where you're going so that if you have a picture of where you're going, you can identify whether you're on the right path. So today we're going to be talking about goal setting. You know Si, I heard you say, and I totally agree with you, that, um, people do set goals but they tend to set different kinds of goals, not relationship goals. I mean, think about New Year's Resolutions. What do people set goals about? 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Losing weight. 

00:45:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Losing weight. What else? 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Quitting smoking. 

00:45:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Quitting smoking. 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Getting out of debt. 

00:45:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Getting out of debt. Getting thinner, getting richer, getting healthier. You know, when you consider the fact that one out of every two marriages ends in divorce in our country, I'm thinking to myself why aren't we setting goals for our love lives? Why aren't we setting goals for our relationships? This is really, important. Now when I say this, a lot of people say well you can't set goals for your relationship. What do you think they say? Why can't you set goals for the relationship? What's the thought about that? No, any guesses? 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN Maybe just take one day at a time? 

00:46:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Just take one day at a time. We heard some talk about that yesterday. Yeah. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) How about... 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Or maybe they, sorry. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Usually the goals that you set for our relationship, uh, kind of fall short most of the time and, you know, not compared to other goals you might have. 

00:46:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So the idea is if the goal, if you're gonna fall short and you're gonna be disappointed, let's not do this. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN Why bother? 

00:46:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Why bother? Exactly. Any other thoughts about why people don't set relationship goals? 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN Because you have two different people. There may be two different sets of goals and what happens if they're different? 

00:46:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What happens if the goals are different? So let's not even get into this. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN Sometimes relationship kinds of things are less tangible than dollars and cents. You can add those up. You can balance your, uh, accounts. You know what's going on that way. Uh, relationships can be a little slippery to, uh, to define sometimes. 

00:47:05
Getting Unstuck Solution-Oriented Goal Setting List your relationship goals. Write down no more than three things you'd like to change or improve about your relationship 

00:47:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Sometimes relationship goals are less tangible. Boy did I, am I glad you said that because that's what we're going to do today. We're going to learn the difference between tangible relationship goals and intangible relationship goals, goals that you can really sink your teeth into and use it as a plan so that when you walk out the door, you know exactly what both of you need to do to achieve the goals you've written down. But before I teach you about solution oriented goals, what I'd like both you and the folks at home to do is to jot down two or three things that you would like to change or improve about your marriage. Two or three things that you would like to change or improve about your marriage. Take some time to do this now. 

00:47:50
Getting Unstuck Please Pause here & write 

00:47:55
[music] 

00:47:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, now before I teach you the magic of setting solution oriented goals, I'm just curious. Anybody willing to share one of your goals on, on your list briefly with us? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN I will. 

00:48:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Go ahead. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Less chaos in the house. 

00:48:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Less chaos in the house. Thank you. Anybody else willing to share? 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN My husband and I being able, taking time for ourselves together. 

00:48:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Taking time for ourselves together. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Right. Like a date. 

00:48:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I'm assuming alone without the children on a date. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah, like dates. 

00:48:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Anybody else? 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN I just was interested in us slowing down and not being paced by outside influences. I just feel like they're driving us instead of us determining what we're gonna do. 

00:48:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Slowing down and not being paced by outside influences. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:48:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Anybody else? 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Talk more. 

00:48:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Talk more. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN I wanna talk but, you know, it's like the male figure's been groomed to, you know, believe that we don't show emotion. So, I, I'm a very, I'm gonna tell you what I think and I want, I wanna be able to talk more. 

00:49:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Without that talking, you can't really get anywhere. 

00:49:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, so to talk more. Okay. Anybody else? That's, those are good goals. Go ahead, you wanna say something? 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN I had, um, a couple but one of them was, um, I think if I give him more personal space, it will enhance the couple. 

00:49:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Because... 

00:49:25
Getting Unstuck Solution-Oriented Goal Setting 1. Make sure your goals are positively state. Instead of, "I wish she weren't such a nag" write "I would like her to compliment me much more." 

00:49:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So giving him some more personal space. Okay, great. Now I'm going to talk to you about setting solution oriented goals. Number one on the list and you can all see it on your lists, okay, when I work with couples and I ask them what are you hoping to change? What do you want different about your relationship? You know the answer that I get? I hear complaints. We are experts about what we're unhappy about and we're novices about what we really would rather have happen instead. So I hear things like I wish you weren't so critical. I wish you wouldn't nag me so much. I can't stand that he's such a slob. Are these goals? No, they're not goals. They're negatively stated complaints. When you reach your, reach out to your partner with a complaint, what do you think's going to happen? 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Defensive. 

00:50:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Defensiveness. Your partner's not going to want to be cooperative with you. Furthermore, if you're thinking about something negatively, that's not a goal. You can't see the absence of something. So let's say for a moment a person says to me, I don't want my husband to be so critical and she thinks that's a goal. So she goes home, puts on those glasses. She's looking for him to be critical, hoping there's less of that. Imagine what their relationship is like when she's looking for him to be critical all the time. So the way I help people turn a negative goal into a positive goal is by asking when your spouse stops being critical or does it less, what will he be doing instead? What will you notice him doing that he's not doing now? And this very same woman might respond, he'd be more complimentary. Now imagine, she goes home. She puts on those glasses and she's looking for compliments rather than criticisms. Do you think they might have a slightly different interaction with that expectation? 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN She'll feel different already. 

00:51:25
Getting Unstuck Solution-Oriented Goal Setting 2. Make sure your goals are action-oriented. Vague Goal I want my husband to communicate better. 

00:51:25
Getting Unstuck Solution-Oriented Goal Setting 2. Make sure your goals are action-oriented. Action-Oriented Goal 1. He'll turn off the TV & make eye contact. 2. He'll offer comments after I'm finished speaking. 

00:51:25
Getting Unstuck Solution-Oriented Goal Setting 3. Break down your goals into small achievable segments. 

00:51:25
Getting Unstuck Please Pause here and share 

00:51:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS She'll feel different already. Bingo. That's absolutely right. And if she feels different, she might treat him more kindly and you know what? She might get another compliment. So it's a self-fulfilling prophesy. I know I did this with my own husband years ago. He and I have different personalities. On the weekends, he likes to sort of veg out after a hard week at work and I'm a real energetic person in case you haven't noticed this already. And I want to go do things and so I remember one day, like it was yesterday, although it was years ago. I said to him you know, when you come home on the weekends, all you wanna do is sit around. You, you know, you wanna watch TV, you wanna just sort of veg out. I really would like to go and do things but you don't ever seem to want to do it. And he got defensive and I thought to myself, I'm trying to work on our relationship and build it and he's getting angry at me? So, of course, I got angry at him and this escalated and escalated and finally I said to him, Jim, this is unfair because all I really wanna do is once every six weeks do something out of the ordinary, like go into Chicago, get tickets for a play and he goes okay. Well, then why didn't you say that? And I went whoa, it can't be that easy. He goes, if you would have said that a half an hour ago, we wouldn't have had this argument. I learned a lesson that day that I need to ask for what I want as opposed to complain. That's a positive request for change as opposed to complaints. You see the difference? So you need to make sure that your goals are stated in the positive and if they're not, you need to ask what will your spouse be doing differently when he or she stops doing that negative thing? That's rule number one. Rule number two. Your goals need to be action oriented. So often, and I know I heard a little bit about this even yesterday and today. Um, we use terms that are very vague. Every hear a politician talk? They use words that they sound like they know exactly what they mean like, you know, truth and justice and the American way and they're filled with power and emotion but what does it mean? We do this with our spouses. I hear things like more space, unconditional love, uh, more respect. When I work with people, those are the goals that I hear but I don't know what it means and neither do you and neither does your spouse and if you don't define it clearly, your spouse may be trying to please you but because you have different definitions of what those words mean, you're missing each other and then like you said yesterday, if you miss each other, you know, and you're not getting positive feedback, you go what's the point? So you just wanna give up. So here's how you fix it. You have to be specific. My question to you is if I were a fly on the wall and I were watching the two of you, what would I see you doing? What actions would you be taking? What would you be saying? What would you be doing when you achieve your goals? For example, if a woman says I want my husband to communicate better, I don't know what that means. I have my own ideas but those are Michele's ideas. So what? I'm not going home and talking to her. She needs her husband to talk to her. So I'll say when he communicates better, what will he be doing? If I had a video camera, what would I see him doing? And she'll say something eventually like he'll make eye contact with me. He'll turn off the television, no ESPN for a while. We will have no children around. We will just be the two of us. Talking, that's it. He'll ask me questions about what it is that I'm talking about to show his interest. He'll make comments. You need to describe your goals in behaviors, in actions. Otherwise, there's miscommunication. And the third rule is that you need to take your step, your goals and break them down into small, doable chunks and by that I mean things that you can do within the next few days. So often when I work with couples, they have really big ideas about what they wanna change and what, how they wanna grow and that's all great but research has shown that unless you take these big, grandiose goals and break them down into things that you can do in a short period of time so that you can experience the success of knowing that you are on track, you ain't gonna get there. You just are not going to get there. So I'll give you an example. I was working with a couple. They were empty nesters. You all know what that is. You know, they get to stage in life where their children are grown and now they're out of the home and this couple, although they loved each other, they led separate lives, kind of parallel but separate lives. She focused on the kids. He focused at work, on work and when the kids were gone, they noticed voila, they didn't know each other anymore. They didn't have a relationship but they didn't want to divorce and I asked them to set a goal and you know what their goal was? They wanted to be best friends. Well, do you go from not knowing each other and being a complete stranger into being best friends overnight? Is that how the process happens? Of course not. So I asked them the question, which is the question you need to ask yourself, what will be the very first sign that things are starting to move in the right direction? Not the ultimate end goal, but the very first sign and make sure that it's something that you and your spouse can do within the next week or so because I am telling you that when you begin to see that you're achieving that step, it, it, you get such a high from it, it makes you wanna continue to do it. Now I wanna tell you this. I suspect that when you, I see you're writing already. You know, you're not even listening to me. You're already writing and you're beating me to the punch here because what you need to do is you need to look back at the goals that I asked you to write earlier today and I have a feeling that they don't fit the three criteria all that well on all the goals that you've written. So what I'm gonna have you do is just you and everybody at home, is to spend some time refining your goals. Take, review the criteria and then compare what you have versus what I've been talking about and fix 'em so that you have solution oriented goals. Good luck. 

00:57:40
[sil.] 

00:57:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Solution oriented goal setting. What was it like? I'm interested in two things, really. First of all, I'm interested in when you compared the goals that you wrote originally to the criteria that we talked about, how'd you do? Did you need to do some refining? Tell me about that first. 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN Um, for me I had one that was right on target, just a, a, a definite, I would like to plan more dates. I mean, you know, that's just simple and easy but then I had one that was I would like to see less complaints about the house. So it's a little negative, I guess. 

00:58:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS A little negative? And how did you transform that? 

00:58:20
UNKNOWN Um, I would like to have a plan for managing the house so it truly is more for me to take some, um, responsibility maybe and I'd like something to focus on. 

00:58:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) You'd like to have a plan that the two of you sit down and come up with together, is that? 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. 

00:58:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. So you'd like to sit down and talk about a plan. When you say for managing the house, I'm gonna, I'm gonna push you a little bit. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Keeping it clean. 

00:58:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Keeping it clean. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN And straightened and more organized. 

00:58:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, so like who does what around the house when kind of deal? 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:58:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And for the two of you to sit down and do that mutually, what you're talking about? 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:58:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Okay. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN And, and the other... 

00:59:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Now wait a second. Can you see how different that is to talk about sitting down to come up with a plan, uh, a strategy, for managing your house, the specifics that we just talked about, as opposed to I want fewer complaints about the house? 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:59:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN I'm not real good at goal setting. 

00:59:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, you will be. You will be when you're done here. What else did you come up with? 

00:59:20
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) And the other one was just kind of vague I guess. Um, I had put I would like to focus more on what we can do to help each other. Um, and I thought maybe that was just a little vague. So I just... 

00:59:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Did you say just a little vague? 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN Just a little vague. 

00:59:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Just a little vague. Yes, yes. And so what did you do with that? 

00:59:35
UNKNOWN Um, I changed it to a specific, um, ask more questions of what can I do to help you today. 

00:59:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS All right. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN Instead. 

00:59:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS All right. So that you will ask that of him and you're hoping he will ask that of you? 

00:59:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah. It would be nice. 

00:59:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, okay. 

00:59:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:59:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS All right. That's really great. How about for you? What did you come up with? 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Well, the big one I had down was, uh, the way I had it stated originally was slow down and not be paced by the outside influences. 

01:00:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I heard you say that and I was thinking this is gonna be a really good example. 

01:00:10
UNKNOWN Yep. Yeah, and I, as I got thinking about it, I was, I was thinking that, um, I'd like to take as much care with what's important to our family and, and the activities that are important to us and our children, um, instead of having everything be determined by outside influences and the, the meetings and schedules and the driving, uh, forces of other people outside of us. Not that we shouldn't be responsive but, um, I sometimes feel like we are, um, just fielding phone calls and saying yes to things that, um, are interrupting, um, what I would like to see happening, not only between Connie and me but with our kids and, um, you know, as they've gotten older, they've gotten busy too so to me it's just gotten way out of whack. The last, uh, summer, I had tried to plan a couple vacation periods of time and, uh, they got chopped, preempted, and, uh, curtailed to like one overnight. 

01:01:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, so now I'm gonna slow you down, okay? I'm hearing lots about, which is okay. 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN Right. The, the, this is... 

01:01:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What isn't happening in your family. 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:01:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Or what isn't happening in your marriage. 

01:01:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:01:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And I'm also hearing some vagueness about those things so what I'm gonna ask you to do is if your goal were accomplished, that you weren't paced by this outside stuff and that you felt more in control, uh, of what was happening in your life, what kinds of things will you and Connie be doing that will give you the sense like, we're on track? 

01:01:35
UNKNOWN Well one thing would be to set aside, uh, I like to use, and I think, uh, we've talked about this. I, Sunday, uh, would be a quiet day. 

01:01:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN Uh, where we could kind of pick and choose maybe what to do as a family, uh, even something like take a nap, uh, go for a bike ride. Uh, maybe take a trip downtown. Uh, whatever we decided we felt like doing, so it didn't have to be highly structured but it would, I would like it to be kind of untouchable time, uh, so that ideas could come to us and then we could follow some leads like that. 

01:02:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Sacred time. 

01:02:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:02:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS The two of you. 

01:02:15
UNKNOWN So Sunday afternoon and evening, what I was thinking about in terms of a day and time during the week for, um, kind of being spontaneous and creative as a household. 

01:02:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So Connie, let me ask you something. If you two were sitting down and he said to you, I don't want our lives to be paced by things that are happening externally. Um, how would you respond to that versus I'd really like Sundays to be a day where the two of us get to decide whether we do things as a family or we do things just the two of us but that we are in charge of that decision. How might you respond differently to those two comments or requests? 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN Um, I think the first one would make, you know, when, when he said it, at first, my first feeling was man, I can't do this, you know? We just got things to do and, you know, but then when he turned it around to a more specific Sundays, you know, I like the idea of just relaxing on a Sunday or just taking it easy. I mean, it, it sounded like a doable thing. 

01:03:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Isn't that amazing? I think that's amazing because you didn't change the content of what you were talking about. You just changed how you were talking about it and you went from her responding to this is impossible to not only is this possible but I agree with you. I want to do this. 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN You know and I have to tell you. Uh, when she first started saying I can't do this, my heart sank and I was thinking, you know. 

01:03:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What am I doing here? 

01:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I and, you know, and I, I got optimistic when she's warming to the idea and when we were, uh, when she was sharing earlier, kind of sharing earlier and mentioning about goals on the house. I almost felt like flipping over here and, uh, because it's been very difficult to have a warm conversation about that. We've hassled a lot about that topic of bringing order, uh, to our home in increments or however. It needs to be done. 

01:04:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, then let me ask you the same question that I just asked Connie, which is if she said to you I don't want there to be so many complaints about what's going on in this house versus I'd like to sit down with you and come up with a plan for who's doing what around the house when, how might you respond differently with those comments or requests for change? 

01:04:35
UNKNOWN Well, I'm in for the second. I mean, I, I, I'll put my hand in on that. 

01:04:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS We can count on you? 

01:04:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm interested in that. 

01:04:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And tell me a little bit about what it's like when you hear her say I don't want so many complaints about the house. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN Well, there's a dead end there because, uh, we've hassled about every aspect of this that you can imagine. Everything from whether goals have any utility at all in being, uh, a part of family life to, um, just the, the, the details of how we get from point a to point b and even, and it's deteriorated to whose fault it is we're not moving. 

01:05:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I'm sure. So how's that sound to you? He's in on the second one. 

01:05:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. That, that's fine. 

01:05:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So again, it's not what you're saying. It's how you say it that makes all the difference in the world and positive requests for change are really the way to go. 

01:05:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:05:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:05:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Thanks for sharing. That was great. 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN I can go along with that. 

01:05:25
PAT LOVE Is it common for people, for a couple, to have opposite goals? I mean, is it, is it common? 

01:05:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) It happens all the time. You know, the truth is, if I look at my, my background and my husband's background, I'm first generation American and my husband's family came over on the Mayflower and if you ask us, like, what are our goals or what, what do we like to do? What's my idea of a great evening it's to get together with friends over dinner and have intimate conversation. If you ask my husband what's his idea of having a great time, it's getting a backpack, going to the mountains in Colorado, finding a remote area where he can, he can be by himself for three days, no soul around and you go, like, what's wrong with this picture? These are opposite goals but you can do everything. He makes an effort to connect with me and be with me and talk with me, even sometimes when he doesn't feel like it and conversely when he has that urge to run and go off to the mountains or go find some island somewhere, where he can be by himself and just meditate, although I have that wanting to be with him sort of feeling inside of me, I, I give him the space. I encourage him to do it because that's what loving and giving is all about. 

01:06:30
PAT LOVE So it's really normal if we're sitting there and the, and the people at home are sitting there thinking wow, you know, you want mountains, I want togetherness. You can say we're normal. 

01:06:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Not only normal but wouldn't it be boring to be married to someone who's your clone? 

01:06:45
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) Oh, when you think about it, yes. Yes. 

01:06:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You think, you know, you sort of dream and fantasize it'd be so nice to be married to someone who felt exactly the same way as you did but it would really be boring looking in the mirror every day. 

01:06:55
JON CARLSON Well now we're gonna have some chances to use that energy and excitement as we move on to the next activity, which, now that your goals are clear, Michele is gonna show you and I think we should underline the word you. 

01:07:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yellow highlighter. 

01:07:15
Getting Unstuck Exercise 3 It Takes One to Tango 

01:07:15
JON CARLSON Yellow highlighter. Just how you can begin to change. 

01:07:20
[music] 

01:07:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, now we've talked about goals so you know where you're headed and now we're gonna talk about what you can do, not what your partner can do, to accomplish those goals. How many people have heard the expression that you can't change other people? The only person you can change is yourself. Raise your hands. Everybody. Well, almost everybody. Where have you been? Um, I have some news for you. You can change other people but you have to begin by changing your own actions first and I know I have some doubting Thomas's and Thomasina's here, like I can never change my partner. Well, let me give you an example and I think I might just change your mind. Let's say you're spending the evening with your spouse and you're having a really, really good time and then, for some bizarre reason, you get it in your head that you want the evening to go downhill. Can you think of something that you can say or do that will affect change in the evening, that will affect a change in your partner in a negative way? Can you think of something. I mean, you're smiling. I know, for example, I could be having the best evening with my husband and if we're in the car, all I have to do is comment on his driving. Right down the tubes. It's over 'cuz he'll get so mad at me. It works every single time. I saw you smile. Did you think of something? 

01:08:40
UNKNOWN I knew exactly the same. You know, if I sit there and throw in a criticism or something. He'll get defensive and... 

01:08:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) About anything. Goes right down the tubes. Anybody think of something when I said that? 

01:08:50
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

01:08:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What did you think of? 

01:08:50
UNKNOWN Well, usually, uh, she has to say anything about selling of my dogs. 

01:08:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS If, that's it. The evening's over. The day's over. So everyone has a sense that they know what I'm talking about when you say to yourself I know how to push his buttons. We know how to push our partners buttons in a negative way. We can learn how to push our partner's buttons in a positive way because I believe that everyone of us has within us positive change buttons. We just have to get better at identifying them and activating them. And so that's what we're gonna be talking about today. Okay? Um, why is it that when I say that, so many people don't see that we have the power to activate buttons? We understand that our partners push our buttons. That we know. You know why we know that? We live inside of ourselves. We're very in touch with our feelings. So when our partner has sort of a negative glance or a negative word, our emotional radar goes off loudly, clearly and we say to ourselves, he started it. Right? It's his fault. But we're not in touch with our partner's, what, actions and feelings. We don't know what's going on inside of them. They have emotional radar too and sometimes something that we don't know that we're doing will trigger that in them. Let me give you an example. I was sitting in my family room with my husband and we were having a conversation. He said something that kind of caught me off guard so I wanted to catch myself again and I glanced over momentarily at the television and when I glanced back, he was reading a magazine and I thought to myself well, if he's gonna read a magazine, I'm gonna watch TV. So I turned back to the TV and when I did, I, I did that for a moment or two and then I glanced back at my husband. He was still reading. I think if he's still reading, I'm gonna watch TV. So I turn back and I watch some more TV and when I did, he got up and he started to walk out of the room. I said Jim, where are you going? We were having a conversation. And he said, we're not having a conversation. You're watching TV. I said I'm watching TV because you're reading. He said no, no, no. I'm, I'm, it wrapped the other way around. Yeah, I'm watching TV because you're reading and he said no, no, no. I'm reading because you're watching TV. I said no, that's not true. I'm watching TV because you're reading. Do you see how it's so circular? We are like this with our partners. It's a circle. So what does this tell you about solving problems? When you get stuck and you think that your partner is stubborn, I am the bearer of some bad news. It's because you have been triggering, you have been triggering your partner to be stubborn by the way you are approaching the problem. You are approaching the problem in the same old way and I call that more of the same. Let me explain briefly what more of the same is all about. In life, when there's a problem, people generally do something to solve it. If it works, great. Life goes on. Everybody's happy. If it doesn't work, instead of telling yourself oh, this didn't work. I should do something entirely different. You know what we do? We tell ourselves this didn't work. We need to do whatever we've been doing more. Say it more loudly. Do it more emphatically. One more time with feeling. Cheeseless tunnels. Remember that? Let me give you an example of what happens when you do more of the same. Not only does it prolong the problem, it escalates the problem. It makes your situation worse. Parents who have a teenager who's sneaky, what do they generally do? They spy on the kid, right? What happens when the kid finds out that the parents are spying? 

01:12:20
UNKNOWN They get more sneaky. 

01:12:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS They get more sneaky, right? Now this is worse, right? But do the parents say to themselves, this didn't work, let's try a new strategy? No. What do they do? 

01:12:30
UNKNOWN Hire a detective. 

01:12:30
Getting Unstuck It Takes One To Tango Which relationships issues or arguments resurface frequently? 

01:12:30
Getting Unstuck It Takes One To Tango What's your most usual way of approaching your partner on these matters? What do you say? What do you do? 

01:12:30
Getting Unstuck It Takes One To Tango If your'e having trouble answering these questions, ask yourself, "What would my partner say I do in these situations." 

01:12:30
Getting Unstuck Please Pause here & write 

01:12:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS They hire a detective. They, that's, I've done a lot of family therapy. That's exactly what they do. They up the ante and when that doesn't work, what starts to happen is the kid gets even sneakier, gets really smarter. Parents don't say to themselves we need to drop this strategy. They get even more spier, spiier, whatever it is that you would say. It makes the situation worse. Let's talk about marriages. I was working with a couple. This woman was starting to feel despondent because her husband was withdrawing. The way she made herself feel better, she went out and she'd go shopping. The problem is, she happened to be married to a man who's very, very frugal and the more she went shopping, the more he withdrew. The more he withdrew, the more she went shopping. She didn't have a clue that her shopping was triggering him to withdraw. He didn't have a clue that his withdrawal was triggering her to go shopping. The very thing you do to solve a problem, if it isn't working, is creating the problem. It's called more of the same and I promise you that if you make a commitment to do less of more of the same in your life, your relationship will improve. You all know what more of the same is, what I'm talking about because I talked earlier about those arguments that you have all the time, those situations that come up over and over again. Chaos in the morning, okay? That's an example of it. Or let's say sometimes you argue every single time your mother in law comes in to town or sometimes you argue about money. You do it the same old way all the time. Or sometimes you argue about your intimate relationship the same old way all the time and you know that what you're about to do isn't gonna work but you do it anyway. You just do it anyway because it's logical. Remember we talked about that. Folks, logic doesn't necessarily work and so what I want all of you to do is to get a handle on what you do, not what your partner does, because if you remember, if your partner's stubborn, you are pressing that stubborn button by your more of the same. So what you do to perpetuate the problem. What is your more of the same behavior? I want you and everybody at home to answer these questions. Which relationship issues or arguments resurface frequently? What's your most usual way of approaching your partner on these matters? What do you say and what do you do? If you're having trouble answering these questions, ask yourself what would my partner say that I do in those situations. And again, keep in mind that you don't have to agree with your partner's perspective, just answer the question. 

01:15:20
[music] 

01:15:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay guys. Your partners are out of the room so it's time to 'fess up. Did you figure out what you've been doing that's more of the same? 

01:15:30
UNKNOWN Yes, I'm afraid so. 

01:15:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS We ready, ready to volunteer? 

01:15:35
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:15:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What'd you come up with Hank? 

01:15:40
UNKNOWN Uh, well I, I tend to withdraw first and, uh, try to overlook it, uh, gut it out, grit my teeth, and then, um, I'll, uh, usually get angry and then I get, uh, critical and I make a good case for a guilty verdict. That's how I put it. Uh, I think at that time, I'd make a very good prosecuting attorney. 

01:16:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, so very succinctly, it sounds like your more of the same is to withdraw, get angry, and then get critical and attack. Okay. 

01:16:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Very much so. 

01:16:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Now tell me, Hank, what button does that trigger in her? 

01:16:20
UNKNOWN Uh, she's hurt. 

01:16:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS She's hurt. 

01:16:25
UNKNOWN And, um, feels unappreciated. 

01:16:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN And then I feel guilty. 

01:16:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Guilty, okay. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN And sad. 

01:16:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:16:35
UNKNOWN And, uh, down deep, one of my deepest desires is that our family, well, our marriage and our family work and, uh, I get, personally, then I feel, um, frustrated and it's easier for me to feel like a failure as a husband, failure like as a dad. 

01:16:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk inaudible ). Okay. 

01:16:53
UNKNOWN I just feel like I'm making a, an emotional mess and I'm at fault. 

01:16:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:16:55
UNKNOWN So, it's, it's very... 

01:17:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS It sounds like it doesn't, it almost doesn't matter what the issue is, it's just that same pattern over and over about lots of issues. 

01:17:05
UNKNOWN What would be my pattern of responding to what I perceive as an immoveable object. 

01:17:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Okay. 

01:17:10
UNKNOWN That's my pattern. 

01:17:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's very honest and very succinct. That's great. I mean, it's not great that you do it, but it's great. 

01:17:15
UNKNOWN Well... 

01:17:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS We'll talk about the next step. Let's, let's just talk about this piece first. 

01:17:20
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:17:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS But that's great. Thanks. 

01:17:20
UNKNOWN I'm similar to Hank in many ways. Uh, but I start off a little bit differently. Uh, things will be bothering me and I'll right up front tell Kim what is bothering me. Uh, then I'll get angry and if there's no resolution, then I just totally withdraw. 

01:17:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uh-huh. 

01:17:45
UNKNOWN Uh, we don't have many problems between Kim and myself. It's usually other family issues, dealing with it, the kids. Um. 

01:17:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So I would imagine that sometimes when you talk about things, it works, okay? Sometimes when you talk about things, it doesn't work and you go into withdrawing. 

01:18:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:18:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Regardless of the issue, this is a pattern, same sort of deal. Okay, so then when you go into withdrawal, what does that trigger in her? 

01:18:10
UNKNOWN She gets mad and, uh, she tends to withdraw herself. 

01:18:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And so you both kind of go your separate ways. 

01:18:20
UNKNOWN Correct. 

01:18:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Okay. 

01:18:20
UNKNOWN I have a 10 year old from my first marriage and the conversations, well, it went, there, she comes over, uh, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays every week, so, uh, what her responsibilities are within the house compared to the other two which are much younger and, you know. So we usually, you know, argue about... 

01:18:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Disagree about what she's supposed to do. 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN Constantly. Yeah, it's the same conversation over and over again, you know. 

01:18:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Which takes the form of what? You think she's unfair or she, how does that work? 

01:18:45
UNKNOWN Well, it's, sometimes she's very unfair. She came from a very large family so everybody was dictated exactly what they're supposed to do and I'm much more laid back, so, when she jumps on the 10 year old, you know, I jump on her. You know. 

01:19:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:19:00
UNKNOWN Uh, verbally anyway. And, um, so we're, the same conversation every week pretty much. 

01:19:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Every week? 

01:19:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:19:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS It's what you have to look forward to every Tuesday or Wednesday, we go through the same old thing. 

01:19:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Right. So now she says, recently, she gets depressed when Monday come around 'cuz she knows what happens on Tuesday. So. 

01:19:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's the same thing over and over again. 

01:19:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So you accuse her basically of being unfair or not treating the kids the same and she defends herself and attacks you. 

01:19:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:19:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS But you know you're right. 

01:19:35
UNKNOWN I'm definitely right. 

01:19:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You're definitely right. I'm glad to see a couple of smiles but I don't see you smiling yet. 

01:19:40
UNKNOWN Well. 

01:19:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Um. 

01:19:40
UNKNOWN If, if there was a way to, to end that conversation and actually make her understand how I see my point of view, it would be, uh. 

01:19:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You would like that. 

01:19:50
UNKNOWN Oh, certainly. 

01:19:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Would you be willing to do something different, even if you're "right?" 

01:19:55
UNKNOWN Um, sure. I... 

01:20:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Well, okay. That's good. That's great. Well, that's a good more of the same. How about you? You said you were having some trouble coming up with more of the same? 

01:20:05
UNKNOWN Oh yeah, big time troubles. Um. 

01:20:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) What, what'd you figure out then? 

01:20:10
UNKNOWN Um, I was thinking normally we argue, we have the few arguments but when we do they're, they're always the same. You know. I'll come up with a logical solution for her problem and then I won't take her feelings into account and sometimes, you know, your feelings don't have to be logical and I'll just keep on, you know, pushing it on her. Oh, but this makes more sense. You're not thinking right or something to that effect and she'll, she'll withdraw big time. 

01:20:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So she's talking to you about feelings and one of the things that you do, then, is you start giving her suggestions of what she could do differently. Is that what happens? 

01:20:45
UNKNOWN I just try to give her a logical solution. 

01:20:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS A logical solution. But does that logical solution generally fall under the category of things she can change? 

01:20:50
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

01:20:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh yeah. 

01:20:55
UNKNOWN All the time. 

01:20:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, okay. How about the others of you? When we talked about more of the same, do you see your role in sort of perpetuating things and keeping things going there or do you still think about as if only she were smarter, uh, took my advice better, we'd be in a better place? 

01:21:10
UNKNOWN See, I feel a little bit like that because of the age difference. I've been around a little bit longer, in my mind. 

01:21:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah. 

01:21:15
UNKNOWN So I should know a little bit more. Um, there hasn't been a resolution to a lot of our problems, you know, uh, things that keep coming up, repetitive problems and knowing that it's not going to be solved, that anything I say will take us from today and go back to a week ago, two weeks ago, things that have happened in the past, it's like, this is the problem. You deal with .I just want it taken care of, be it a trashed bedroom or dirty clothes laying around the house from the kids. This is it. You deal with it. And then I withdraw and if it doesn't, I stay withdrawn. 

01:21:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I'm, I'm gonna give you a little tip on this one. I have a feeling your withdrawal is part of the problem here and hopefully, as we go on, you're gonna figure out something else you can do. Well, now I got rid of the men and so the women are here. So let's talk turkey. Did you figure things out about what each of you are doing that's more of the same in the relationship? How about one at a time, let's hear from all of you. 

01:22:15
UNKNOWN Oh, some of the arguments that we always keep having over and over again are, seem to be the basic, like everybody else and I understand that, but it doesn't make it easier. 

01:22:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS No it doesn't. 

01:22:25
UNKNOWN Um, the money situation, the parenting situations and the household responsibilities are just too great for the two of us to even handle. Um, and then some of the things that I do the same is, like, when I'm try, I do the bills. I'm supposed to do the bills with no money but I'm still supposed to pay 'em. So I'll say, um, you know, I need you to do 'em with me. I need you to help me so you can see where the money isn't and his answer to that is just, just have it there. Uh, I can't have it there and he'll walk away. He won't discuss it and so then that just makes me even madder and then I won't do the bills. So that's messing us both up in the process. Um, like with the parenting, I was raised one way, he was raised another way and I'll tell him, well, you're not doing it the right way. You're not parenting. Parenting is a big word. You're just letting them go and learn on their own. Well you're not gonna learn if nobody teaches you anything. How are you supposed to learn if nobody teaches you? Um, and my big thing is I keep making lists over and over and over. Who needs to do what. There are so many things that need to be done. We both need to start doing them or nothing's gonna get done and everything's gonna fall apart and he then immediately is defensive because I have these lists. But I always tell him you need to, you need to. You're not, you're not. 

01:23:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ah. You see, I was just... 

01:23:50
UNKNOWN See? It's the blaming. And I'll go straight there. 

01:23:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) I was just about to turn to your pals here and ask them if they say it. 

01:23:55
UNKNOWN Oh I have. Yes. 

01:23:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Any theme in some of the things you came up with. Did you, did you hear that? What did you notice about what she just said? 

01:24:00
UNKNOWN Well. 

01:24:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly that, huh? 

01:24:00
UNKNOWN It's an attack and a blame. He's feeling attacked and, and you're feeling blamed or he's feeling blamed or, you know, it's... 

01:24:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) cycle. 

01:24:14
UNKNOWN Yeah. We're both attacking each other, both blaming each other and not trying, not realizing it enough to work together. 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN What I do that's more of the same is I, um, I talk to him about it and, you know, say I want you to talk to the kids, you know, without so much criticism and more, you know, kinder, gentler, more respective, you know, way to the kids but what I find myself doing is I defend my kids and side against him, with doing it, and I think if I had to say what he would say I do in those situations is probably nag and criticize. 

01:24:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. And so when you defend your kids or tell him that he's doing it the wrong way, what kind of response do you get from him? 

01:24:50
UNKNOWN I think he feels pretty helpless. I don't think he knows any other way to do it. 

01:24:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And when, you're probably right. And when he feels hopeless, how, what does he do? 

01:25:00
UNKNOWN Withdraws. 

01:25:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS He withdraws. How about for you? 

01:25:05
UNKNOWN For me, it's, I guess it's all in the same line. Um, our biggest problem is Hank seeing me as too busy outside the house with things going on and not focusing on the maintenance of our house. So he would come home and maybe be critical of... 

01:25:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Of what not being done? Give me an example. 

01:25:25
UNKNOWN Well, maybe, um, clutter in, in the back room. The back room is the, the entrance way into our home and so there might be things on the table or coats on the chairs or shoes around the floor. You know, stuff like that and instead of, you know, his first thing is... 

01:25:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) Signs of life, you mean. Really. 

01:25:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible ) organized. Why can't we be more, you know, (inaudible ). But, so and I see that as an attack of me and, you know, my person is to be with people. I like people. I like going out and doing things and... 

01:25:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah. 

01:25:55
UNKNOWN So then I withdraw because I see it as an attitude towards me, an attack on my person. So then he with, well, he withdraws. I withdraw. He withdraws. You know, and it's just a vicious cycle. 

01:26:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS How long does this distance last? 

01:26:10
UNKNOWN Oh, it can last a long time. 

01:26:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Like? 

01:26:15
UNKNOWN Oh, it could last a week. 

01:26:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Really? 

01:26:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:26:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You can go a week with being sort of separate? 

01:26:20
UNKNOWN Because I get more stubborn and I say well, shoot. He needs to make the first step and, you know, and to approach the subject would be almost weakening my defense. I don't know. 

01:26:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Your pride takes over, right? 

01:26:30
UNKNOWN I guess. 

01:26:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, how do the two of you make up? 

01:26:35
UNKNOWN Uh, usually, I wanna say usually I will then say how long will this go on? 

01:26:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay, so over time you see yourself as being the one to approaching and saying how long will this last. 

01:26:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:26:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And do you often get a green light from him at that point? 

01:26:50
UNKNOWN Um, usually. 

01:26:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:26:50
UNKNOWN Usually because then, you know, he sees that what he did didn't work, you know. His goal was to get the house more clean or whatever but his attack does not help that issue because then I'll get stubborn and don't wanna do anything. 

01:27:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Of course. Okay, so the withdrawal leads to a whole set of circumstances that push you further away rather than bringing you closer. Okay. Okay. Thanks. How about for you? 

01:27:20
UNKNOWN Me? I need feelings to be (inaudible ). I need love. 

01:27:23
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Right. 

01:27:23
UNKNOWN And just to round it all up, I'm sensitive. He's not. He's very, he's German. He's hard. He says men don't cry. 

01:27:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So what do you do to try to get him to be more emotional in your relationship that doesn't seem to work all that well? 

01:27:40
UNKNOWN I try to get him to talk. 

01:27:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. So what do you do? 

01:27:40
UNKNOWN I ask him, I say Shawn (ph). Like just the other day, on the way here. Shawn, why did you want to date me? If you've had opportunities before, why me? And you turned all them down. Why me? 

01:27:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And does that work when you ask questions like that? 

01:27:55
UNKNOWN No. He goes you know I don't like talking about it. 

01:27:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:27:55
UNKNOWN Or he'll go, I don't know. I just do. 

01:28:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. And, and when you don't get the kind of response that you want by asking those, I would say really personal feeling oriented kinds of questions, what happens inside of you when, when that happens? 

01:28:10
UNKNOWN What happens to me is I sit there, I become a mute. 

01:28:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You do? 

01:28:15
UNKNOWN And he knows. 

01:28:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You shut down. 

01:28:15
UNKNOWN I totally shut down. Now, if we weren't in the car, I would have walked away and I would have walked out the door and (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:28:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You have a captive audience, but there you are quiet. Is that what happens? We need our men to be more expressive, more verbal about feelings, but as women, we need to understand their language. They have a language of action and I bet you, and I've even see it here, that your partner shows you in many, many ways through his actions that he loves you, that he thinks you're beautiful, that he thinks you're great, that he doesn't wanna be with anyone but you and what I would suggest that you do, and here I am giving solutions, we're just supposed to be talking about more of the same, is to start to pay more attention to the ways in which he shows you, as men often do through action, that he thinks you're number one. So if your more of the same is to get him to try to open up all the time, there's some merit in that. Men should do more of that, but the flip side in terms of real giving is you have to push yourself to see the little things that he does that shows you that he really cares for you.

Getting Unstuck Do Something Different For A Change Change anything. Do a 180. As As If Actions Speak Louder Than Words Do Nothing 

01:29:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay gang. Here's the fun part. You know what your goals are. You know which of your actions are preventing you from getting to those goals, right? And now you wanna know, Michele, what do we do? How do we get out of this rut? We understand it. How do we get out of it. So I'm gonna give you a few suggestions but before I do, I'm gonna tell you a story. There's a man who's named Gregory Bateson (ph) and he was a renowned anthropologist and actually one of Margaret Mead's many husbands. Um, he was asked to come to a zoo in San Diego, uh, because there were lots of otters that were lying around kind of listlessly and maybe you know that otters are, by nature, very, very playful animals. And so they were concerned and they wanted him to come and investigate the situation. So he did and he got there and sure enough, those otters were lying by the wayside. They were just not doing anything and they looked kind of like depressed otters. He took lots of notes day after day after day and nothing changed and one day, he decided to do something different and he took a piece of paper and attached a string to it and dangled it over the area where the otters were lying and shortly thereafter, one of the otters spied it and came up and started batting the paper around and not long after that, another one came up and started batting it around and it wasn't too long after that before the whole, I don't know whether you call a gang of otters, school of otters, whatever it is, they were all in on the action and while this was going on, all the sudden Gregory Bateson then takes the paper and pull it away and as the story goes, from that day forward the otters continued to play. Now, I remember when I heard that story for the first time, I said to myself what did it say on the paper? Well obviously it didn't say anything on the paper but Gregory Bateson's summary of this whole situation was that if you do nothing new or different, nothing new or different's going to occur. If you do anything new or different, you at least increase the chances that something different will happen. I mean, who would have predicted that dangling a piece of paper over listless otters would get them to play with each other. No one would have predicted that but it was different. Now when I heard this story for the first time, it was really, sort of a release for me because up until that point, I was the sort of people who didn't want to take an action until I thought I had gathered all the information, read lots of books, spoke to all of the experts before I did anything and now I know that the only way you can really screw up is by doing the same old thing, 'cuz you know it's not gonna work. You're not even taking a risk by doing something different. You're taking a risk by doing the same old thing because you're going to persist in the unhappiness that is the result of doing the same old thing. I want you to think about the otter story from now on because anything that you do as different is better than what you've been doing when it hasn't been working. Now, you're gonna think to yourself, Michele, please don't send us home or don't turn off the TV with just that story because I want something that I can sink my teeth into and so I'm gonna give you some suggestions, some of the ways in which many of the couples that I've worked with over the years and in my own life that's helped to get out of that rut but you have to understand that this is not a comprehensive list. These are just some suggestions. You are only limited by your imagination. It's up to you, remember? Creativity, flexibility. We talked about that earlier. So let me begin to tell you some of the ways people have begun to broke patterns, break patterns that haven't been working. The first one on the list is change anything. Do anything different. When you feel yourself about to slide into that same old routine, stop, take a breath, and do anything different. I am going to read to you a letter from a guy who understood this principle from my work and applied it to a situation in his own life and is one of the most wonderful examples of a do something different that I've ever heard. It's a real letter. Last week, Sue arrived and we talked about how we could better resolve our, our conflicts. I took one of your suggestions and recommended that we could do something different. As an off handed suggestion, I said that we could agree to fight only that we could have to do it without our clothes on. Are you listening? I wanna make sure you're alive here. Okay. This would eliminate fighting in shopping malls, family gatherings, while walking down the street, or any other place outside in our winters. And since our five children are no longer at home, we agreed to try it but I think she was a little bit skeptical. Well, she was normal, huh? We had tried so many other things and they worked briefly but we would slip back into our old ways. Well, the inevitable happened and we, and we started into an argument. It had elements and patterns of countless other disagreements. I decided to go for it. Now, if we were younger and trim, then shedding our clothes could be a pleasant distraction that would make us forget what we were arguing about but, on the other hand, lumpy, saggy bodies can be quite funny and also a humorous distraction but what happened was better than either. I got right into the argument and, at the same time, began peeling off clothes, throwing them emphatically of the floor of the laundry room to punctuate the very serious points I was making in my case. Meanwhile, Sue was at first taken aback. You are serious, she said. I agreed and continued making my case as socks, shirt, pants, and underwear hit the floor. Sue started to laugh. She laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks. She was laughing so hard, she cried. And I laughed too, but I continued discussing the issue. Can you imagine this? 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:35:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS We soon found ourselves, and listen to this, we soon found ourselves in complete agreement. In the past few days, we've laughed again and again about the hilarious image. Sue left for Boston about three hours ago, but before she left, she said that she'll never be able to keep a straight face in an argument again. I can't even remember what the argument was about. I just know it was the best one we ever had. Doing something different. I'm gonna tell you about a do something different that I did. I'm gonna tell you lots of stories about what I do. Um, we belong to a golf club and we had gotten the membership, the new roster of members and I opened it up and I noticed that all the men had their names listed but the women's names were in parenthesis, sort of like an after thought. Now, I wouldn't consider myself a big feminist but somehow, that kinda didn't sit right with me so I said to my husband, who was making breakfast at the time, I can't believe they put women's names in parenthesis. And he said to me ah, well. I guess it's not that big a deal. That's the way it's done which then prompted in me an even more firm response with well maybe it shouldn't be done that way. I mean, think about it. And guess what happened? The more I stood my ground, what do you think happened? 

01:36:35
UNKNOWN The more he stood his. 

01:36:35
Getting Unstuck Do Something Different For A Change Change anything. Do a 180. As As If Actions Speak Louder Than Words Do Nothing 

01:36:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS The more he stood his and finally I said to him, you know what? I am going to write a letter to the golf club at which point he stopped making, he stopped making breakfast, stormed upstairs to our bedroom, shut the door, and there I was. And I thought to myself now, what was my instinct? My instinct was to go up there and defend my position again and I stopped and I asked myself what is my goal here? You know what my goal was? I wanted to have a good day with my husband. I wanted to feel close and connected with him. Would defending my position about this issue that really wasn't all that important to me have done that? Obviously not. So I thought Michele, practice what you preach. What could you do that would be different? I thought about it and I wrote him a note. I'll tell you what it said in just a moment. I went upstairs to our bedroom. He didn't even make eye contact with me because he was expecting me to be nailing him about what he had said but I went over to him, I handed him the note and he opened it up and you know what it read? I love you. Michele in parenthesis. We laughed. He quit, he tried not to laugh at first. I have to admit but it started coming and we had a great day together. Do something different. Second possibility. Do a 180 which means exactly the way it sounds. It means doing the opposite of whatever it is you've been doing. That's illogical but we have thrown logic out the door here, haven't we? I'll give you an example of do a 180. I know a woman who likes a lot of peace in her house. She can't stand tension and anger. Now of course, as the world would have it, she's married to a man who has a very low level of frustration and whenever something starts to bother him, he starts getting kind of, you know, worked up and she doesn't like that. So what she does is she tries to calm him down. She says everything's gonna be okay. Don't get so bent out of shape. What does, how would a man respond when he's starting to get like this and she's saying don't worry. You're laughing Hank. Tell me, how does a man respond? How does it feel? 

01:38:35
UNKNOWN You, you wanna make your point again and you don't want it to be, get swept under the rug. 

01:38:40
Getting Unstuck Do Something Different For A Change Change anything. Do a 180. As As If Actions Speak Louder Than Words Do Nothing 

01:38:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly. And so you start feeling angrier, which of course made this woman feel, like, angry at him because she's just trying to help, right? Just trying to help. And so things would get really out of control. She noticed that the more she tried to calm him down, the worse he got. So one day, with this concept of do a 180, she decided to become creative. He was working in the family room on a computer and all of the sudden he started to boil. I heard, she said, I heard him say, um, I can't believe my boss expects me to do this. I wasn't at the training. How am I supposed to know what to do? He's getting louder and louder and louder and almost like there was a rope pulling her in to calm him down, but instead when she got in there, she realized that she had to do a 180. You know what she did? This is a very peace loving woman. She slammed her fist on the table and she said what was your boss thinking? If you weren't there, you'll never get it done. How are you supposed to do it? And now you're gonna be in a bad mood. Our evening's gonna be ruined. Dead silence. He looked at her and he said settle down, I'll figure it out. You get the point gang? You know, this didn't solve all of their marital problems but I can tell you that it was the very first time that she realized that it wasn't just his bad temper which of course came from his father and it wasn't just his bad job or his boss but there was something she was doing that she could change that was triggering that response. So sometimes doing just the opposite, even though it's illogical, illogical guys, it works and brings about the response you're looking for. Here's another idea. Act as if. In relationships, we think we're mind readers. If we're about to approach our partners with something, we think we know, we, we say to ourselves, I just know how he's gonna respond. He's gonna give me a negative response. He's gonna be angry. He's gonna be rejecting and when we think that, we begin to act in certain ways that broadcast our expectations and when we do that, what do you think happens? 

01:40:45
UNKNOWN You get what you're looking for. 

01:40:45
Getting Unstuck Do Something Different For A Change Change anything. Do a 180. As As If Actions Speak Louder Than Words Do Nothing 

01:40:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You get what you were looking for. It's the self-fulfilling prophesy. So when I, so what I tell people to do is to, well, just as you're about to approach a situation, you've got those negative tapes going in your head. You just know how he's gonna respond. I just know how she's gonna react. Stop and ask yourself how would I be acting differently if I were expecting a positive outcome. What would I be doing differently/ And do that and watch the results. It is magic and I'm gonna give you an example. I was flying home. I'd just done a conference. I was away for, I don't know, maybe three or four days. I was with friends and I was having a pretty good time and I noticed maybe about the third day, Mr. Mom at home was kind of losing patience with sort of handling things. My husband's really great handling things when I'm gone but he was having a hard time and he was eager for me to be home to sort of take over and I could sense the resentment in his voice and so I thought he was starting to feel, you know, resentment, resenting about me and on the flight home, my stomach started going like this. He was picking me up at the airport and I thought, said to my friend, I said you know what? I know that he's gonna be in a really bad mood when I get off the plane and I'm really, really tense and my plan was to get off the plane and be kind of low profile. Not tell him about the good times that I had had at the conference because he was home, minding the shop. Not be bubbly because I knew he would be mad at me. To just sort of walk in with my tails between my legs and wait to see what happened. So my friend, whose a therapist, used my ideas against me and said now, if you were expecting Jim to be really happy to see you, what would you be doing instead and it was so simple. It was so clear to me. It's very easy. I'd get off the plane. I love my husband. I would throw my arms around him. I'd tell him how happy I was that he was at the airport. I would start telling him about what had happened over the course of the few days. Do you get the picture here? What could he be thinking about if I walk off the plane all tentative and sort of my stomach in a knot? Could that bring about the very response that I was expecting? And conversely, if I come off and I'm really warm and friendly, happy to see you, might that not change things? So whether you feel it or not, forget feelings. Imagine a positive outcome and do what you would do if you were having a positive outcome and watch the results. Here's another idea. Actions speak louder than words. You know, I, we, we finally have learned that men and women are a little bit different when it comes to talking. That women generally get more of a charge out of talking and we tend to talk more, um, then men do and that men tend to be a little bit more action oriented and yet, in so many relationship classes and if you ever go to therapy, what do we focus on? We focus on verbal stuff, learning how to talk better. That's great but especially for you women, listen to this. A word to the wise. That if your words aren't getting through, and by the way, this works for men too. But I wanna make it special out to women. If your words aren't getting through, if you've ever said to yourself, I talk until I'm blue in the face. Anybody ever say that? You've said that too? 

01:44:10
UNKNOWN I have. 

01:44:10
Getting Unstuck Do Something Different For A Change Change anything. Do a 180. As As If Actions Speak Louder Than Words Do Nothing 

01:44:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS He does it all. He does it all. Okay. I talk until I'm blue in the face. I've said this a thousand times. That should be a tip. You need to stop talking and you need to take action and be creative. I have lots of stories about that but Pat shared a wonderful story as we were planning this whole thing that I wanna share with you. She's a neatnik. She likes everything in order. Well, who would she be married to, of course? We know how that one goes, right? And one of the, her pet peeves is the fact that her husband would always leave his drawers open. All the time. So what did she do? She did the logical thing. She tried asking him nicely. That's always sort of the first round of things and then she tried getting a little more firm and that didn't work and then she tried nagging and although she didn't say it, I bet she tried criticizing. And guess what? She still had open drawers all over her house. That's when she decided maybe actions speak louder than words. We have a very creative Pat. You know what she did? One day she wrote up a sign, put it in the drawer and the sign read shut me. I annoy your wife when I'm open. And you know what she told me? She has never had an open drawer since. Want another technique? 

01:45:30
UNKNOWN Please. 

01:45:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. This one's called do nothing. Actually, it's one of my favorites. Sometimes, no matter what you do, if you're a fix it addict, you're always wanting to solve a problem. You're going after it and going after it and going after it, anything you do is more of the same. It's time for you to take a rest. Take a sabbatical. Sometimes doing nothing is doing a lot. I'm going to give you an example. Now you're gonna find out about one of the most problematic more of the sames in my life, that I've done for years and thankfully I'm not doing it anymore. My husband and I had major disagreements in how to handle our daughter. She's a, a great kid but he had this philosophy that you have to rule with an iron hand. I mean, be firm and set limits and I always thought that, you know, I agree with those limits but I also think he's being a little too harsh because it was my belief, does any of this sound familiar? It was my belief that TLC, you know, being nurturing and loving and warm and tender is really the way to go with kids. So the more, so what would happen is my daughter would do something and he would step in and take a firm stand and I felt like I had to soften the blow somehow, to you know, "her ego," her ego. And so I would step in and what do you think he, how would he respond when I stepped in? 

01:46:50
UNKNOWN Get out. 

01:46:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS He would get out? 

01:46:55
UNKNOWN No, you need to get out. 

01:46:55
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Defensive. 

01:46:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, you're coming up with a solution. How did he respond? 

01:47:00
UNKNOWN He would get defensive and you're, and harder. 

01:47:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS (crosstalk) He would get defensive and harder. He would get defensive and harder at her, angry at her, angry at me. The opposite, just like we talked about before. The opposite of what I wanted. Did that stop me? No. I'd have to step in again to make it even nicer, which of course would make him even harsher. Okay? And this went on for years. So one day, I was out in California doing a seminar, which is about as far as you can go without leaving the country, right? And late at night, I get an SOS call from my daughter and she says, she's crying. Mom, dad's saying mean things to me. I'm really upset. I want you to come home. Well, there's are fighting words to a mom. You're smiling. You know this, don't you? Okay. You've been there? 

01:47:50
UNKNOWN Many times. 

01:47:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Lots of people have been there. That's why I tell the story. Put your father on the phone was the next thing I said. So she gets my husband and, in the time that it took for him to get there, I don't know what happened. I was struck by a solution oriented lightning or whatever it was and I knew. I asked myself, this is what I said before, I asked myself, what am I hoping to accomplish here? Closeness with my daughter. I wanted her to feel better. If I were going to nail him about what had happened, would that have accomplished my ends? It would be the opposite and I would be in California, with my heart aching. So he got on the phone and he's waiting for the shoe to drop, 'cuz he knows the routine. You know? You know the dance. You've been there, done that so many times. Except I didn't say anything except I said I just wanted to say good night to you and I think he was dumbfounded. He said okay good night. And I said I'll talk to you tomorrow. We hung up the phone. It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life but I wanna tell you what happened. The next day on my way back, at the airport, I called early in the afternoon hoping to speak to my daughter to find out how she weathered the storm and how things were going but instead of getting my daughter on the phone, mid-afternoon. I mean, around 3:00, my husband answered the phone. He's not normally home at that time. I said Jim, what are you doing here? He said well, I have to tell you. I felt really badly about what happened between Danielle and I last night and so I left work early and I picked her up at school. I brought her a dozen roses and I'm taking her out to dinner. Now, are you happy, he said to me. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:49:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And you know what I said? I'm really happy. Are you happy? He says yeah, I'm really happy. I'm telling you that had I done more of the same, that never would have happened. 

01:49:45
UNKNOWN You're right. 

01:49:45
Getting Unstuck Please Pause here & practice 

01:49:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS But by doing nothing, it gave him an opportunity to look at himself rather than me and point fingers and he's such a good man, it gave him an opportunity to rectify the situation and he more than rectified it. They had a wonderful time together and things have been so different ever since. That's when doing nothing is really something. You need to change what you do if you want to have a better reaction and a better response from your partner. Those are just some ideas. What I'd really like for you to do right now is to spend some time answering the question and those of you at home as well. I'd like for you to take a look at your more of the same that we worked on before and to think about a creative way you could handle things differently. 

01:50:35
JON CARLSON What are some of the things that you're gonna do differently after, you know, being through this experience and, that might help you to get unstuck? 

01:50:50
UNKNOWN I know for myself, I was really touched by your story about your daughter and your husband and, um, you know, I think that usually what I do comes across to Sius (ph) nagging or criticizing and so what I'd kind of like to do is take myself out of the middle of the two of them and let deal with it and also to compliment both of them when their relationship is doing well. 

01:51:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Absolutely. Great plan. 

01:51:20
JON CARLSON (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:51:24
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Great plan. 

01:51:24
PAT LOVE The other thing that you made me think of, Kim, was something that you alluded to earlier that I really liked and that was I should start watching for the times that he does it right and, because I often have my detectors on, as you, my goggles on, looking for problems instead of watching for the times that he's doing it the way I prefer. 

01:51:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Exactly. 

01:51:45
PAT LOVE And that's when I compliment him too but to be looking for those times. 

01:51:50
JON CARLSON Maybe you could take down some of these signs you've got up in the drawers (inaudible ). 

01:51:58
PAT LOVE Hey, it worked. I didn't ever have to do it again. 

01:52:00
JON CARLSON That would be something different. They're in the car. They're, you know... 

01:52:00
PAT LOVE Worked for me. Worked for him. 

01:52:05
JON CARLSON What other ideas? 

01:52:05
UNKNOWN I think that, uh, I'm also gonna try a different approach to, with, with Susan and my 10 year old as far as teaching disciplinary and stuff like that because, uh, arguing obviously hasn't worked so far so maybe if I give her some compliments on some of the suggestive ideas she comes up with as far as responsibility on a 10 year old, uh, hopefully that will help. 

01:52:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You know something? I am so glad that you said that because what I noticed, you all heard my parenting story and when I stepped out of my save, saving role and I kind of let my husband and my daughter solve it themselves, he didn't have to be the bad guy anymore and he became so gentle and so much more loving and it was, it was just a complete turn around. So I found myself complimenting him and appreciating, um, the fact that he was doing that but you know what else started to happen to me? I, for the first time, appreciated what he was doing before, which was teaching her about the world and the importance of limits. It's kind of like it really does these funny things to your head when you become solution oriented. Watch out. That's a warning. 

01:53:15
UNKNOWN One of the things I happen to learn, uh, is just because I'm invited to an argument doesn't mean I have to attend that argument. 

01:53:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's a great way of thinking, that. 

01:53:30
UNKNOWN So I'm gonna take that do nothing approach or at least try to. 

01:53:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's great. RSVP no thank you, right? That's great. 

01:53:35
JON CARLSON There's an old story about someone came and was attacking the Buddha and throwing all sorts of things at him and saying all of these nasty things and his disciple said aren't you gonna defend yourself and he said, you know, when somebody gives you a gift and you don't accept it, who gets it? And then he just walks away and that's what you're gonna do. It's wonderful. Yeah, wonderful. 

01:54:00
UNKNOWN When I was listening to this, I was just, I became more aware of how much I do love, uh, Connie and our children and how contradictory some of the things I've been approaching, um, them with, how contradictory that is and, um, in my heart, I just really want to communicate the other. So. 

01:54:20
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:54:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What's that like, Connie, to hear him say that and to see how he is right now? 

01:54:25
UNKNOWN Well, you know, it's funny because he truly can be extremely loving and, and uplifting and encouraging and, um, and when he gets into the complaining roles and stuff, it, it's, it's like I don't want that person around, you know? So I, I just love it when his focus is more towards uplifting and encouraging and, um. 

01:54:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And when the real him comes out, right? 

01:54:50
UNKNOWN You know, it is. It, it's like, you know, I know. I know that about him. That's why I married him in the first place. 

01:54:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And that's probably why you're still married to him. 

01:55:00
UNKNOWN That is why because we do get back to that spot, you know? Sometimes it's after a lot of, um, bloodshed but... 

01:55:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, I will make a prediction for you. If you both put into practice some of the things you've learned here, you'll get back to that spot a lot more often. It's a nice place to be. 

01:55:15
JON CARLSON I have really learned a lot, you know? And we've had a lot of fun but I, I never thought that this was gonna be this kind of a journey, you know? This journey from being down maze number four, you know what I mean? 

01:55:30
PAT LOVE (crosstalk) Right, right. 

01:55:30
JON CARLSON And then the otter bin and then in your dresser. 

01:55:30
PAT LOVE Exactly. 

01:55:30
JON CARLSON And now feeling not stuck anymore. 

01:55:35
PAT LOVE I was gonna say. You're not stuck. 

01:55:35
JON CARLSON Not stuck anymore.
