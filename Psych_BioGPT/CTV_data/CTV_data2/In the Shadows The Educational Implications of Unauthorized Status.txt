Beyond Borders: Personal Reflections 

00:00:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE Alright, so to start us off on our theme today. As some of you know I am actually the daughter of an immigrant woman Beatrice of Colombiana, who came to this country seeking an education and after one year met and married, what we colloquially call a gringo. An American, white American. Um, she's the one here in pink in the photo and the woman standing next to her is her twin sis-, twin sister. My Tia Lucia, and my middle name Lucia, L, is after her. So both of these woman were remarkable in a number of ways for me, and played a great role in developing myself as a cultural being. In the sense that I live beyond the united states. So here I am in development as a cultural being. Um, these little pumpkin heads and my brothers and myself. And we're in traditional Colombian dress, and you see the traditional fabrics, and flowers, even the musical interest, instruments is a t tiple. Um, and this was a hallmark of my youth. Growing up here in the states with a very strong sense of pride and just family itself as a Colombiana. So we had a lot of fun learning Colombian customs, sayings, and so on. Though I also at the same time was aware of the difficulties that, um, my mom and other Latinos in this country experience. You know, prejudices, discriminatory hateful behaviors. So international immigration issues, in a varied and evocative ways, and are actually quite important and have deep resonance for me. And so I'm guessing that for many of you in the audience they do as well. So I want to turn the focus on you for just a minute and ask how and what international concerns affect you. Just think of these questions here. 

00:02:25
Beyond Borders: Your Stories What's your name? Where were you born? Where were your parents born? Your grandparents? What language(s) did you grow up speaking? What language(s) do you speak today? When where why? 

00:02:25
MARIE L. MIVILLE Seemingly simple questions such as Your Stories What's your name? So my name in American is Marie Miville. But in Columbia its Marie Lucia Meville DeGusman Nogera Marcott. So think of your reactions when you hear a name, you know. Where were you and your family born? What languages do you speak? They begin to cover many of the personal stories that are represented here just today in this audience, and at this conference. Just to get a sense, raise your hand if you were born in a place other than the United States. And you can count Puerto Rico, or however you want to count yourself. How many of you were born other than the United States. Now keep your hand raising. The rest of you, how many of you have at least one parent who was not born in the United States? Okay. How many of you have a grandparent not born in the United States. So this is the majority of us in this room. Just very close to who we are of people born and raise in some place other than the United States. Okay, how many of you grew up speaking English, or a language other than English in addition to? How many of you speak that today? So again it just gives us a sense of who in this room international and immigration issues resinate for. Now here's just a few more deceptively simple questions. 

00:04:00
Beyond Borders: Your Stories 

00:04:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE You know when and why did you come to the United States. What were your experiences as a newly immigrated person. Family, community, you know, all of those things are important. How did you survive economically? That's always a big question. What were your experiences at school. So during the next couple of days beginning with our key note this morning we're gonna talk about these stories, some facts, information, and just you know, kind of get real about what it's like to come from another country grow up here and deal with some of the policies. Because one of the things in the United States, is, you know, we have a lot of immigration policies and they can be opening they can be harsh. 

00:04:40
Immigration Policies, i.e., Institutionalized Oppression 

00:04:40
MARIE L. MIVILLE Um, and so I'm not going to, we don't have a whole lot of time to talk about this, but if you think about immigration legislation in the United States, you know, words like, 'It just turns on a dime.' 

00:04:55
Immigration Legislation in the U.S. Many, many turns, most recently with Proposition 187 in the early 1990's in California. 1996/1997 federal legislation also denying services, followed by roll-backs of these laws. Today, perceived failure of U.S. Government to enact "reforms" of immigration legislation. Battle turned to state and local levels. Patchwork of laws ranging from harsh punitive measures to the creation of 'sanctuary cities.' By April 2007, 1169 bills and resolutions across all 50 states being considered (double the previous year) 

00:04:55
MARIE L. MIVILLE So we have actually currently in this law a patchwork of laws that can range from very harsh punitive measures. We're, you know, well we've heard about some of the states are, Arizona and Oklahoma where a police officer can arrest you on suspicion on being an illegal, 'illegal,' you know, um, person. Undocumented, unauthorized status. And then we have a place like New York which in many ways is considered a sanctuary city, so this is all in the same country. So we actually been almost crazy in the way we've handled, uh, immigration and the policy. There's just hundreds of years now of constantly changing back and forth. And, um, I want to talk about specifically particular law in Oklahoma. I lived there for eight years, and they passed the law back in '07, 2007, and these are just some of the things that they, they did, right? 

00:05:55
Makes it a state felony to knowingly transport undocumented workers. Creates state barriers to hire illegal immigrants. Requires state contractors to check the immigration status of workers. Requires proof of citizenship to receive certain government benefits, including the education of children. 

00:05:55
MARIE L. MIVILLE Making it a state felony to knowingly transport undocumented workers and so on. The, the big one that affects us as teachers and mental health professionals is that last one. Requires proof of citizenship to receive certain government benefits including the education of children. And so today we have school systems in that state andd other states, where if you don't have so called papers you run the risk of being deported. So this is just a couple of kid, they're now 18, but they were boys when they came to the United States. And these are just some of the things they've lived with and come to believe. 

00:06:35
House Bill 1804 "I wonder, why start college and spend money if you don't know how you can get a job after you're done?" Manny, 18 in US since 5 years of age. "We know until we have papers we have to be alert and never feel safe. You never feel completely well and always take precautions. Don't pull attention to yourself with what you do. They can take you away from your family." Luis, 18, in the US since 12 years of age. 

00:06:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE For example Manny says, 'I wonder, why start college and spend money if you don't know how you can get a job after you're done?' So imagine educational aspirations for someone who feels there's somehow illegal, unauthorized. This second one is ever more heart rending, from Luis, 'We know until we have papers we have to be alert and never feel safe.' Imagine being a child, never feeling safe. 'You never feel completely well and always take precautions.' Each of those statements, 'Don't pull attention to yourself with what you do.' Imagine a child who doesn't speak up in school. What kind of attention and services do they get? 'They could take you away from your family.' All of those things. And this is, these are the comments from teachers working with these kids as they have realized the in-, just the oppressiveness of some of these policies and laws. 

00:07:35
"What do you do with a kid in school whose parents have been deported? Theey don't train you for that in principal school." Teacher Chris Brewster. "I had no idea this existed - that kids are forced to live in a subculture. It's wrong. It's not cool. It's not OK. We're giving their kids a good education and we can start there." Teacher Marcie Escobar. 

00:07:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE One of the teachers said, 'Well what do you do with a kid in school whose parents have been deported? They don't train you for that in principal school.' And another teacher, Marcie Escobar says, 'I had no idea this existed. The kids are forced, forced to live in a subculture. It's wrong. It's not cool. It's not okay. We're giving their kids a good ed-, education and we can start from there.' So in short the base perspective of our conference is that education and health, no matter where or who you are, where you're from or who you are, is a fundamental right. And so that brings us to our key note speakers today. And they're going to talk about our laws, our policies around immigration, and how we can continue to hamper the public health, education, and well-being of people living in the United States. And I would include citizens as well as those with unauthorized status. So it's my pleasure to introduce doctors Carola Suarez-Orozco and Marcelo Suarez-Orozc, and it's not coincidence that they have the same last name. They're a married couple. So I'm just gonna say a few words about each and their incredible work. Carola is a professor of applied psychology at New York University Steinhardt School of Culture and Education and Human Development, and she's codirector of immigration studies at NYU. She publishes widely in the areas of (inaudible ) families and youth, educational achievement among immigrant origin youth, immigrant family se- separations, the role of the social mirror and identity formation, the role of mentors in facilitating youth development, and gendered experiences of immigrant youth. Her books include, 'Learning a New Land,' 'Immigrant Children in American Society,' 'Children of Immigration,' 'Transformations - Migration Family Life and Achievement,' 'Motivation Among Latino Adolescents,' and 'The New Immigration and Interdisciplinary Reader.' And by the way, we have a great book exhibit and I know they worked hard to have both Carola and Marcelo's books there. Really very significantly in 2006 um, Carola was awarded an American Psych-, Psychological Association Presidential Citation for her contributions to her field of cultural psychology and immigration. And also as importantly, remember we had Melba Vasquez here last year. The first latina APA president. Well Melba put forth a presidential task force on immigration and Carola's the chair. And she's going to, they're going to be releasing the report sometime this year. Marcelo, his research on conceptual and empirical problems in the areas of cultural psychology and psychological anthropology with a focus on the study of mass migration, globalization, and education has been funded by the NSF, WT Grant, Spencer, Ford, Carnegie, and many other national and international foundations and donors. He's the author of numerous public, of numerous scholarly essays, award winning books, edited volumes, published by some of the leading scholarly outlets in the world. Marcelo is the Courtney Sale Ross University professor of globalization and education at New York Un-, University where he also holds the title of university professor. At Harvard he was Victor S. Thomas professor of education and culture. In 1997, along with Carola, he co-founded the Harvard immigration projects, and co-directed the largest study ever founded, funded in the history of the National Science Foundation's Cultural Anthropology Division. This was a study of Asian, Afro-Caribbean, and Latino immigrant youth in American society. And so they published that book, 'Learning A New Land - Immigrant Students in American Society.' Marcelo lectures widely throughout the world, and is often featured in global media. In 2006 he was awarded the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle. Mexico highest honor to a foreign national. And in 2012 he was appointed special adviser to the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the City of The Hague on education, peace, and justice. So please join me and welcome doctors Suarez-Orozco.

00:12:20
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO Thank you so much. And mucha gracias for that wonderful Colombian welcome. Um, uh, you, um, uh, take my breath away with that warm and generous introduction. It's the kind of introduction that my father would have liked, and my mother would have believed. So I'm the, I'm very, very pass-, touched, and I'm very, very happy. I'm delighted to be back at the CEE, and especially delighted to be part of this important event. Uh, on an issue that will define our country and more broadly all the advance post-industrial democracies in the 21st century.

In the Shadows: The Education Implications of Unauthorized Status Carola Suarez-Orozco - NYU Marcelo Suarez-Orozco - NYU Beyond Borders: Transforming Lives Through Traditions & Innovations February 23, 2012 

00:13:15
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO So let me start by making an, a, a, very fundamental point. Unauthorized immigration to the United States stopped, and we have a moment when it stopped. In fact its gone negative, there is no, the US is now losing, not gaining unauthorized immigrants after two generations of unprecedented growth. The task moving forward in our country is going to be the managing the transition of really the legacy of two generations of mass migration. Driven by the forces of globalization that have transformed the nature of our economy and our society over the last, um, generation. Today we want to start by making some general reflections on how we got to this status quo, and then Carola will, uh, outline the conceptual and empirical features of some of our more recent work with unauthorized uh, youth. Um, and we will uh, specifically outline issues pertinent to the educational and psychological well-being of the children of immigrants. So I want to start with a brief set of reflections about this age of movement. 

00:14:55
The Age of Movement 

00:14:55
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO Migration maketh man. And today when 49% of all global migrants are women, migrations, migration maketh women. Homosapiens, -sapiens was born from homosapiens nobilis. Migration is written in our genetic code. It is in our bipedalism. It is our sterioscopic vision. It is in our neocortex. It is written in our DNA. Contrary to what your politicians may say, immigration is fundamental to the making of the human condition. In our country immigration is history and more fundamentally destiny. It accounts for how the United States came to be what it is today, whether through voluntary or involuntary immigration. And more importantly it will reshape the nature of our economy and our society moving forward. It's very important to keep in mind that worldwide the rate of immigration has remained very stable over the last 100-years. Roughly 2.5 to 3.2% of the worlds global population is on the move. Is, uh, uh, our migrants living in countries other than the countries of their birth. So while I'm in the business of studying immigration and more immigrants, better for us because we get to come and meet wonderful people and discuss our ideas and uh, and learn. The truth of the matter is that over 95% of people, on earth are not migrants, they're not going to be migrants, and uh, only a small rate of the global population is uh, is on the move. Yet, in the current climate of economic crisis, political grit lock, and cultural melez, immigration has become a topic of urgent concern. Three features dominate the current debate on immigration. First and foremost the topic of our conference today and tomorrow the ubiquitous of undocumented immigrants. In our country today there are 70 million of us who are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. Most of the hands that went up when Marie did the exercise, most of us who are born overseas and came, those of us who were born in the United States of, of foreign born parents, that's about 70 million people. Of the 70 million people, approximately 11 million, that's what the US census calls the foreign stock population of the United States. Of the 70 million people, approximately 11 million and shrinking, have no papers. Meaning the vast majority of immigrants in the United States are legal immigrants or citizens. Including citizen children growing up in households headed by an authorized immigrant. This is very important to normalize the question of immigration in our country, because the lesser angels of our nature are in charge of the conversation today. The second fundamental concern is the economic implications of large scale immigration in a time of uh, economic crisis and uncertainty moving uh, moving uh, uh, forward. And uh, of course the topic of, of, of our own research, the matter of the adaptation and the transition of the children of immigrants into citizenship, into the labor market, into the family of the nation. So in many, many ways it is because of immigrations deep economic, demographic, and social implications that the topic requires a kind of a, a, careful engagement. An engagement based on uh, good data. Not the kinds of f- a-, outrageous, outlandish, uh, uh, comments that circulate in our political debates and in our media around uh, around immigration. We need a debate grounded on quality data, on coherent principles, and above all on ethical values. The great Texas congresswoman, Barbara Jordan, head of the Commission of Immigration Reform once said, 'Immigrants remind u-, what immigrants do for us is reminding us what it is, what it means to be an American.' It's not the superficial that economists have about, 'Do the, the price, wages, that create late, do they create work, what are the costs of immigration?' There, there much more fundamental issues at stake regarding the character of our cultural democracy moving forward. Yet regardless of the urgency and the seriousness of the topic of immigration, public discourse on immigration has reached its lowest common denominator. (inaudible ) has published a piece, uh, yesterday where the, we make the argument that the gap between the facts on the ground and the, the debates in the public sphere have reached an unprecedented sort of, we live in two worlds. It's a world of facts and reason, and a world of fantasy and wishful thinking. When Rick Santorum says that all illegal immigrants are by their very nature lawbreakers, when Newt Gingrich says on public television that Latinos want to be ghettoised. Want to stay in the ghetto, they don't, Spanish is the language of the Ghetto. When Mitt Romney says that attrition through enforcement, which is really attrition through oppression, will solve our immigration problems, or when yesterday or before, the day before said that Arizona is the model for the nation immigration wise, moving forward, they simply either knowingly or unknowingly don't know what they're talking about. The data on these three characterizations are overwhelming. Contrary to Rick Santorum, immigrants including and perhaps above all unauthorized immigrants have much lower rates of criminality. The former chair of the Department of Sociology at Harvard did a number of breathtaking studies showing the general powerful relationship between large scale immigration and declining crime rates in the United States. The four safest big cities in our country today are all close to the border. The closer you are to Mexico and the more immigrants you have the safer you're going to be. The data on this are powerful. They're irrefutable. Latino children are learning English today faster than in any previous generation of mass immigration to the United States. Certainly much faster than the Italians learned English 100-years ago in the lower east side. Farther more (inaudble ) beginning with Lilly Wong have established a long time ago, after they're learning English they are losing their home languages. And tragically we think that's okay. We think that's kosher. The immigrant language as on of my former colleagues once said, 'The US is a cemetery for languages. Germans brought German, the Japanese brought Japanese, the Italians brought Italian and they all died.' By the second generation most Latino kids can't say good morning to their grandmothers. And have a conversation over breakfast in Spanish. Certainly by the third generation Spanish is gone. 

00:24:30
Global Migrations Global Migration 1990-2010Figure 1-Growth of Global Migration 

00:24:30
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO Global migration intensified rapidly on November 9th 1989. We have a beginning day. In the social sciences we don't often get to do this, but this is actually very fascinating. What happened November 8th, 1989? It's the day the Berlin Wall fell. Global unauthorized came to a full stop on September 15th, 2009. What happened on September 15th, 2009 a few blocks from here? Right that's the day we all learned we can't ever retire. I certainly can't retire from NYU, we've lost so much money that uh, Lehmon Brothers, our retirement shrunk by whatever, a third the day Lehmon Brothers filed for bankruptcy. So that's that bracket from 1989 to 2008, during that generation, during those 20-years over a million immigrants came to our country. For approximately 20-years global migration went from uh, 155 million in 1990 to a high of 250 million 20-years later, right? So the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Lehmon Brothers bracket this moment of mass global migration. Immigration is the human face of globalization. Globalization your topic promise and this topic aftermath makes cultural diversity normative in the world's cities. Our cities are more diverse in terms of languages, religions, ethnicity, race than ever before in the history of the world. Diversity defines the demographic social and culture spheres of all major cities above all of course our city. This morning children from 100 dif-, 90 different countries got up, got into subways, got into buses to go to school. This has never happened before in the history of the world. One city encompasses the entire range of the human condition. But this is not a New York issue, we have a kind of a, a kind of a, a narcissistic exceptionalism when we think about immigration in the US. Right? In Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Hague this is the widest country in the middle of Europe, right. Two-thirds, two-thirds of the kids that got up to go to school today come from immigrant homes. Two-thirds. In Paris, a third of the kids that got up this morning to go to school come from immigrant homes. In Copenhagen a fifth of the kids, right? Our greatest poet Walt Whitman said, 'I contradict myself. I contain multitudes.' The tenth most industrial nations state contradicts, it contradicts itself, it contains multitudes. The era of the German romantics, of this theorized fate between language, culture, the folk in harders charm and the nation is undone by the forces of globalization. The unit of global migration in the 21st is not workers and it's not individuals. The fundamental unit of immigration in the 21st century could be best defined by framing immigration as above all an ethical act of and for the family. Globalization is the macro context of global migration, the family is the meso context. An ethical family nurturance, reciprocity, and care giving emanates global migration today. It is what drives Ukrainians and Uzbeks to Russia. Indians, Indonesians, and Philippines to the Gulf states. I was teaching for NYU in Abu Dhabi this last term. For the first time in the history of the world, 90%, nine-zero, nine-zero, 90% of the work force in the Emirates are foreign workers. This is a global phenomenon. In China alone there are 150 million immigrants today. Rural to urban folk. Many of them illegal immigrants. In India there are well over 340 million immigrants today. See the epicenter of everything is not the US anymore or Europe. We're moving to the BRIC countries. That's the future of the world. Look it up on Google what BRIC countries stand for. 

00:29:20
Rate of Immigration, USA 1890-2010 

00:29:20
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO The rate of immigration in the United States today is lower than is being in pro-, in previous eras of mass migration. So again contrary to the hysteria in the media and in the political class immigration today is lower than it was. Um, uh, before. While the absolute number remains very high in the US. We now have three times the number of immigrants three times more than the second largest country of immigration. The Russian Federation. Yet, it is very, very important to keep in mind that the era of mass unauthorized immigration into the United States may turn out to be a fleeting moment in the last 200-years of immigration to our country. In the words of doc Massie at Princeton, quote, 'Illegal migration in the United States stopped about four years ago.' You never hear that from your candidates in the, in the, in the primary season today. Indeed professor Massie continues, 'Between 2008 and 2009 the net number of illegal immigrants entering the United States went negative. And the entire population fell from a high of 12 million,' those were the happy drunk days of Bill Clinton, my former boss Larry Summers and Bob Reuben when the US Economy was growing at an unprecedented rate, when 7% of the US GDP was driven by new construction and when authorize and unauthorized immigration simply reached numbers that we had never seen uh, before. Those days are over and those days are not coming back. Since 2009 according to professor Massie, quote, 'There has been an equilibrium fluctuating around 11 million people with no trend in either direction.' Meaning the US is currently uh, uh, um, shedding, uh, immigrants through fundamentally two mechanisms. First the unprecedented rate of deportations. No audacity and no hope from the president of the United States. The president of the United States is deporting more unauthorized immigrants uh, today then we've ever deported in recent history. Where roughly 400,000 deportations. Then we have 400,000 deportations a year, as Carola corrects me, welcome to my life. Plus all the south deportations through the campaign now fully in place of attrition through enforcement. This is why Massie and others have argued the US is currently in a negative immigration momentum. The problem from now on will be a problem of managing the legacy of 11 million people that are very unlikely to self repatriate. If you look at the folk that are continuing to try to cross the boarder without papers today, overwhelmingly there folk with relatives and children in the United States. It is the kind of deep rootedness of the unauthorized immigrant population that remains in the country that suggests that farther attempts to remove them will continue to create a world in which living in the shadow of the law will affect millions of children, including, and I will now turn it over to Carola, millions of citizen children who are citizens, growing up in unauthorized, in households headed by unauthorized immigrants or children who through no agency of their own find themselves orphans of a state. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:20
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO Oh, thank you. We're going to be trading up back and forth and as Marcelo has nicely setup caught in the wake of the political and media discourse about immigration and the untenable immigration policies are the children of immigrants. 

00:34:40
Children of Immigrants in the U.S. 

00:34:40
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO There are estimated of, there are an estimated 5.5 million children growing up with unauthorized uh, parents. 5.5 million. Not a small number. Most of those 4.5 million are citizen children, born in the US. Approximately 1 million are so called dreamers. Unauthorized, undocumented, and some call them illegals. Um, these children are American in spirit and voice, but their families are illegal in the eyes of the law. And so what we're here to do today is consider the developmental and educational consequences of those particular circumstances. 

00:35:35
DOCUMENTATION STATUS Unauthorized Child/Adolescent Family/Child with Ambiguous Documentation "Limited Legality" In process Temporary Statue Citizen Child/ Adolescent in Mixed Documentation Family Citizen Child/ Adolescent of Unauthorized Parents 

00:35:35
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO So what I would like to start with, uh, before we get much further is complexify the whole idea of the so called illegal versus legal uh, rhetoric. It's not a black and white kind of situation. Uh, there are many shades of gray in that particular status. So yes there are some children who are straight out unauthorized. Um, you know, there are kids who will have past the boarder uh, been past the boarder you know, 15 minutes ago. And they are not un-, they are not documented. Some of those kids may have arrived a year ago, I me-, I, I, I mean they were a year old and have been here for as much as 30-years. So they spend their entire life here, but the, you know they were past through when they were a year old. So I can give you a case of young man, of a Korean origin, his parents came on a, on a, on a, student visas, they overstayed their student visa. Uh, he was raised here at a, he never knew he was unauthorized when he was 16, he went to apply for college, he was a, he was the valedictorian by the way at Stiveson. Um, he then disc-, he discovered he was unauthorized, his parents had never told him. He somehow got through on a scholarship to a top University. He went through a four-year degree. Um, he then left, had no whe-, place to work, it, th-, so he works as a delivery boy and his parents, Korean, uh, store. Uh, he's now 31-years old. Uh, he's aged out of, if the dream act ever passes he's aged out of any possibility of actually being a-, authorized. But that, so, he unfortunately falls within that unauthorized, straight up unauthorized category. Then there are families and children who are falling in the category uh, ambiguous documentation, some people refer to that as liminal legality. They're often in the process of applying for documentation status. Uh, which, because our system is broken, can take two, five, seven, ten years to go through many asylum seekers, are in that uh, in that space. Um, there in temporary status, and they can fall in and out of status. Um, I'll give you quick, uh, example of that. Uh I was recently on the Zeros Fellow-, Zeros Foundation Fellowship Committee, reviewing, um, um, fellowship applications. There was a young woman born in a Central American Country, um her parents were asylum seekers, they came under a horrible situation. She was 12-years old when she gained, the family was given asylum, uh, temporary asylum status, um it took forever to go through the process so when she was 21-years old, so that's, she came at 12, so nine-years later, uh finally they get a hearing in front of the judge, the judge makes the decision that yes her parents are finally have been granted, the good news is her parents are been granted asylum. She's doing the translation of the hearing. The bad new is she's aged out. Uh, and she's told that she's going to be deported. So, uh, the good news is she was able to fight it, but it was four more years before she knew for sure. Um, so that's, that's an example of you know this kind of liminal process. And then there are approximately four million kids who are in these two other these fall in these two other categories. And these are basically citizen children, they're born to in the United States or where they're automatically citizens, unlike some other nations that don't have this rule in Germany you are not an automatic citizen if you're born here, you have to apply at a certain age, and some of them uh have unauthorized parents. All the kids may be, will be citizens and their parents are unauthorized. But many, you have many situations where some kids are authorized and some kids are unauthorized. So you have situations where uh the parents will immigrate, they'll leave a child behind as they're trying to, you know, get themselves settled, children will be born here and then the kids who are brought over are unauthorized. So you have to have these kind of, um, these situations where some members of the family are authorized and some are not. And that creates complications of many kind. Psychological and otherwise. Um, and, and then, I would, I, I'm now um thinking about adding a 5th category because I have a situation of, in one of my classes right now of a student who, and I would call this falling out of status. Um, and this is an example of a person who has a green card, um, but her mother had done, you know, had married someone f-, you know to, to b-, to basically for, had paid somebody to marry her. Uh the, and the daughter was given a, a green card. Um, and but the I, I just found out about it, so not they're not only removing the mother's, and, and, and deporting the mother, but are there trying to deport, uh, my st-, student. Who has been here since she was four years old. Who was a topnotch student at uh, uh, major university, has an undergraduate and is now getting a masters degree. Um, and it's, you know, an exemplary person in every way. But so, th-, these, I guess what I'm trying to tell you here, it's un, you know, legal, illegal. It's much more complicated than that and you never hear that discourse in the news when the conversation uh, is made there. 

00:41:55
Stages of Development Early Childhood Middle Childhood Adolescence Emerging Adulthood 

00:41:55
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO Most of the conversation that happens about this whole issue leaves the kids out of the equation. There's not a whole lot of um, consciousness about kids. Uh, when there is, you know the research is out there, most of the research is around this transition from ad-, from adolescence to emerging adulthood. This sort of coming to consciousness as people realize they can't get a drivers license, they can, you know, the transition to college is going to be tough. So there's you know, what is, what is, much of what is written is in this kind of a in this developmental phase. Um, the activism with the dreamers is in this kind of age spectrum. Just very little thought or conversation about the younger, you know, younger ages. And um, increasingly I became uh, conscious about this when I was, I was asked to participate in a research study by the Herbert Institute who was doing studies of the kids who were caught in the wake of the deport, of the um, the factory raids that were going on where parents were being deported in the end out of the, out of the um, out of the re-, out of the factories and work places. And kids were being left behind. And you know, and they was trying to figure out what were the um, implication for psychological and physical well being for those kids. Um, and so, you know, th-, this and, the-, became very, um, evident that it's not good for kids. Um, and uh, you would, uh, it should be obvious, but you know, we were able to kind of look at it systematically. Um, and then, um, there's very good work that here that Yoshikawa has done where, and this was kind of an accidental finding out of the, out of the, out of his research where he was looking at children who were uh, he, he was, it was inf-, (inaudible ) infant study where, um, they, they lo-, they, you know recruited babies at um, in hospitals in New York City. And they, you know, Chinese babies, Mexican babies, uh, Dominican babies, African American, you know, the whole different groups, um and what one of the things that they discovered is that the children whos-, um, who herrer-, who happen to be in the, came from unauthorized families were having much less access, getting much less access to resources. Even though the kids were themselves born here and therefore authorized because they have unauthorized parents. Um, they were, um, receiving far less services because their parents were afraid to access them. So there was some very interesting research coming in that. So um, stages of development and what are the implications for various ages is important to think about. 

00:44:55
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO This looks very complicated. You cannot read it all, but this is uh kind of a map of what we're going to be talking about today. I just talked you through this, the documentation status. Right? Uh, um, and I'm going to be talking you through the developmental st-, outcomes. A whole slew of um, health, health implications, cognitive implications, educational implications, socio-emotional implications, civic engagement. So different kinds of outcomes that we should be thinking about. Because most of the research has always been about, well is it good for them educationally, but really um, whether or not you are a, you're growing up in an authorized home has some real implications for uh, a host of um, developmental outcomes. In the middle is a very familiar for probably many of you, Bronfenbrenner. You've all heard of the Ecological Model of Bronfenbrenner? I see some nodded heads. So the idea is, the individual, the individual child doesn't grow up all by himself or herself. There un, net-, they are nested in a family system, uh, that's a microsystem, uh, and they have contacts, and schools, and neighborhoods. I'm going to walk you through each of of these systems, so don't panic if you can't read the individuals, what's in each area. Um, I just want to give you sort of the big picture. Um, and then mesosystems is the relationship between the various microsystems. The exosystems is, are the more distal, um, uh, systems that the child doesn't have direct contact with the parent the caregivers will have contact with. Like the workplace, the civic institutions, etc. And then the macrosystems is the larger overall, you know, historical and economic context that's going on. Right? So that, that's kind of what the model that we're looking at. I always like to have a map, so I hope you don't mind if I share it with you. Okay, so you said that you were going to talk about the macrosystem. We're going to share it back and forth so you don't get bored of hearing one voice at a time. 

00:47:15
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO So very, we're, um covering a lot of territory so very, very rapidly, but macrosystem, system we mean of course the, the legal structure, infrastructures including the pathways to regularize status for the children and youth with themselves have uh, no uh, um, uh, authorization uh, status. 

00:47:35
Available Legal Pathways to Regularize Status State of the Economy Media Representations of "illegals" Levels of Xenophobia 

00:47:35
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO Um, one of the available pathways to make the transition from unauthorized to authorize, uh, and one of the complications here the devil dwells in the details, and eventually one day probably not under the Obama administration we will have comprehensive immigration reform. And we will have an iteration of a um, comprehensive package that will have to include the establishment of a pathway to regularize the status of the 11 million people that have no status today. Um, if you are unauth- ,an unauthorized immigrant, and you are a-, if you're an immigrant and you are petitioned to become uh, to come to the United States from a country like Mexico or the Philippines or China it is likely that you'll wait in the order of ten to 15-years. In regards to the so-called anchor baby debate, another one of these great mythical debates that our political class indulges in, uh, you can apply like everybody else. You can petition for the um, formal migration of your parents after you become of legal age. So you're an anchor baby born in New York City today by 18 you can petition, and again the waiting line today for countries like Mexico, the Philippines, and China is in the order of ten or 15-years. So maybe 20-some years from now maybe 30-years from now, you will be in line to become a lawful immigrant in the United States. There are no automatic mechanism that take in for citizen children in regards to the authorization of their parents. Um, very, very briefly I'll be see the state of the economy in the, in the um, uh the 'happy days' as Joe Stiglitz the eminent economist here Columbia put it in his book, 'happy days of Bill Clinton and Bob Reuben and Larry Sommers', the US was getting about a million unauthorized crossings. Uh, and everybody was looking the other way, because businesses extracted huge, huge profits from the unauthorized labor that was being uh, sucked up like a vacuum cleaner by multiple sectors in the US economy. Today of course we have a very, very different story. The media representations in a way represents the, the, the kind of conceptually come under the, the uh, the general frame of what Carola very influential uh, uh, paper called 'The Social Mirror.' What are the representations of the unauthorized population of the United States. The media, um, we just released a book, Roberto Suro, Vivian Louie, and I uh, called, 'Writing Immigration Academics and Journalists in Dialog,' and media representations of, of unauthorized immigration is dominated by three dynamics. Do a content analysis for 100-years is all crisis driven. It's all about the latest sort of explosive crisis. It's not about the every day life of the vast majority of people who have papers, who are not unauthorized, who are not in-, involved in deportation proceedings, who are not involved in any criminal or unlawful behavior. It's crisis driven, it's episodic meaning nobody thinks about immigration if you do opinion poles and you ask people, 'What are you thinking about immigration?' Immigration falls below, I don't know. Meaning when you run out of things that you worry about, you worry about the economy, you worry about crime, you worry about education, then you say, 'Well gee, I don't know what else,' and then immigration comes below, 'I don't know.' They have foreground immigration for people to register that it is an issue. Then you ask people, 'Well what do you think of immigration?' And then people have all kinds of theories about the immigration. So the media is very episodic in its engagement in immigration, and overwhelmingly it's not about the structures. It's not about the macro-context that have delivered 11-million people in the context of an unprecedented global vertigo, and global kind of um, drunkness that led to this troubled economy especially in the um, in the real state sector where entire cities in the United States, how did Atlanta become one of the huge Latino cities in the United States. Well, look at Atlanta, look at the real state in the sand belt, and you get a picture of what was going on. And obviously the levels of xenophobia, 100-years of research of the earth shows very powerfully when, when the unemployment rate is below 5%, immigration is a non-issue. When the unemployment rate comes um, uh, it's higher immigration becomes a very powerful unpredictable uh, set of uh, of, of concerns and the story today is the same story that was articulated 100-years ago. It's crime, it's assimilation, it's will they change our country in ways that will make the United States unrecognizable. 100-years ago the lower east side was all anti-Semitic, was all anti-Catholic, and it was all um, anti-Irish, anti-Italian, uh, anti-Eastern Euopean, right? The panic then was the Jews and Catholics will never assimilate to American society. The United States Supreme Court today, the Supreme Court that will decide the affirmative action case shortly, 100% of the members of the US Supreme Court are either Jews or Catholics. There are no wasp left in the supreme court. Okay, I'm done, I'll finish. I can't resist this, this is so delicious. If 100-years ago you were in the Lower East Side, and you would say the Jews and the Catholics will enter this inner sanctum, sanatorium of American Power the US Supreme Court, people would have laughed, they would have said, 'Impossible, they'll never be real Americans.' Right? And Ben Franklin earlier said exactly the same thing about the Germans. Quote, 'They're going to Germanize us, we'll never be able to Americanize them.' So it's the same story that repeats itself. It's crime, it's language, it's assimilation, it's 'They're going to change us, we're not going to change uh, them.' Okay. 

00:54:50
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO Yeah, I'm going to fast forward though the next, um, so the exosystemic issues are um, around issues, are you know include tops-, to-, topics around civic institutions. 

00:55:10
Civic Institutions Family Distrust of legal institutions (e.g. police & social services agencies) Parental underutilization of programs (e.g. health, social services, preschool) Parental Work Conditions Precarious & Exploitative work conditions Vulnerable to work raids Indebtedness to coyotes, snakes, and recruiters Concentrated Neighborhood Disadvantage 

00:55:10
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO Uh, do the, does the family uh, trust or distrust legal institutions. Um, and often uh, the worries around the ICE get um, you know, radiate out to, towards any kind of um, uniform. Uh, and especially since, the police is now being uh empowered uh, uh, in, uh, in many states to take on uh, ICE like responsibilities. Uh, and this, so you see uh, not only uh, the adults, but also the children distrusting, uh, the you know, authorities and you know, an ideal world would not be distrusted. Um, so, uh, you see problems with parental underutilization of programs uh, and therefore their citizen children are getting less access to things like healthcare services, social services, preschool services, libraries, and that sort of thing. Which including has implications so we'll talk about development. That's where I really want to spend a lot of time. Uh, the parental work conditions uh, have uh, secondary effect on kids. The parents are often in pre-, per-, often precarious and exploitative work situations. Uh, that stress obviously has implications for kids. They're vulnerable to work raids, um, uh, they are often changing jobs. You change jobs you have to change homes, if you change homes you have to change schools. So all that has a cyclical effect on kids. Um, their parents are often indebted to coyotes, snakes, or recruiters. You know, people help them cross, and therefore that's a huge financial stress on the family. Which then that's less resources for the kids. Uh, and they're often living in spaces of concentrated neighborhood disadvantage, which we, is well documented to be uh, uh, you know, have implications for the children;s well-being. At the microsystemic uh, level um, they uh, kids are often living for reasons you know, we just covered, uh, in uh, a less than optimal school neighbor-, in uh, uh, uh, neighborhoods less than optimal schools. Uh, therefore they have compromised access to quality schools and services. 

00:57:40
School Context Compromised access to quality schools and services School mobility. Family Processes Parent-child separations & complicated reunifications Deportations Parent Ethic/ Racial Socialization Financial Investments in children Housing Instability (crowding, instability) Parental 

00:57:40
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO And I just mentioned the school mobility problem. Which we, is well documented to be an issue to be worried about for optimal school performance. Um, at the family level many of these children have uh, undergone uh, extended family separations. Uh, because, you know, the parents can't bring them over right away. Um, they have to you know save up the money to bring them over. The crossings are, are, um, dangerous. Um, there, um, there problems of, of mothers and fathers being deported, and then the difficult decisions of are they going to have to send back the kid are the kids going to go back, the citizen kids going to go back with the parents, are they going to stay with aunts, um or uncles, or even fictive kin. Um, and all the heart-wrenching stories around that. This issue parental/ ethnic racial socialization uh, Diane Hughes has done very interesting work with African American families about, you know what can, how do parents socialize their kids to racism, discrimination, kind of the difficulties of um, of a growing up with uh, issues of racism and um, and uh, you know, I keep thinking that one of the issues is, you know, how much do, how much do parents tell their kids about these vulnerabilities. Is there what I call an, 'earthquake plan,' you know around what happens if one of us is deported. You know, where do you go to? Um, you know, how much do you protect your kids by talking to these things, but then do you make them more vulnerable in terms of the fears around these issues, and then housing and stability, um, the ability to financially invest in the kids when the resources are stretched so tightly. 

00:59:30
Ontogenic Worries about family deportation Food & housing insecurity Dawning awareness of status Worries about future education access Negative experience with authorities (e.g. ICE & Police) 

00:59:30
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO On the uh, individu-, ontogenic is the individual level uh here we have uh, the chronic constant fears of, of, of loved ones being deported. Uh, I testified in front of congress uh, with two children, 11-year olds at my side. Um, and you know, the, to hear their stories, one of them the mother had been deported about a year and a half ago. And um, she had to assume responsibility of taking care of her younger, much younger siblings. Um, and she basically heard her mother, you know, she got a phone call, her mother had been deported, and she never saw, and she has never seen her mother again. Um, the other boy uh, has not had his father deported, but speaks of everyday waring um, will, um, every time he goes to school, will that be the last time he sees his father. This is sort of the kind of chronic wear and tear of that fear. Uh, and can you imagine what that would be like? Um. the food and housing insecurities, um, the, the kids whose in their evidence to report the kids whose parents were deported. Um, their food and housing and security went up dramatically. So there all their anxiety, the depression the crying the food, you know, all of those thing predictable, but what we also saw was these, these outcomes also showed up. The dawning awareness of status. This sort of growing consciousness of when they suddenly realize about their own status. In the cases where it's not um. Where it's not just their parents, but also themselves. Uh, huge worries about future educational access. And even if they can't figure out a way to get access into the, in college, will it even pay off. Um, and then, you know, negative experiences with authorities, uh, that's on steroids. Um, alright, uh, so now I want to, I want to, I got what, five more minutes? Yeah? Okay, so lets spend four minutes on this, and then we'll, I'll turn it off to Marcelo to uh, to, to, um, finish up. 

01:01:50
Developmental Outcomes Health (Yoshikawa, 2011) Cognitive (Yoshikawa, 2011) Educational Trajectories (Albrego, 2006, Gonzalez, 2011) Periodic interrupted schooling Truncated higher education Socio-Emotional Trajectories Psychological symptoms Comprised sense of social belonging Complicated identity formation Civic Engagement (Arnett-Jensen & Flanagan, 2008) Civic Engagement (Arnett-Jensen & Flanagan, 2008) Constructed Labor Market Access (Gonzalez, 2009, in press) 

01:01:50
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO So, the, the developmental outcomes that I want to talk about uh, there are health implications for not, you know, for growing up in families with unauthorized uh, uh, parents. Um, there are hea-, at the health level less access to health services that children are entitled to. Uh, beginning-, starting at the very beginning. Um, and in a mixed status fam-, family you see that the kid who the child who is authorized will get more services than the kid who is not authorized. So this is you know, this is a clear problem. Uh, cognitive implications, well, less, you, they're on two levels. Um, if you, you know, we know that there's an, there's a link between health and cognitive outcomes. We also know that if you have less access to preschool, less access to libraries, um, you know, you're, you're, you're going to, if you start behind the behin-, you know the wedge of, behind it just goes, it just keeps growing over time. So there are cognitive implications. Um, for uh, for falling into this status. Uh, and this is for the young kids, right? Um, and I, you know, I urge you to read the work of Yoshikawa, um, the educational trajectories, um, the lots of interrupted schooling, which is deep-, deeply problem-, problematic and truncated uh, higher education, lowered aspirations. Uh, for some kids it's like they've become extra resilient, and extra, you know, putting their, you know, their energies into the fighting the wins. But other kids just sort of go, 'Why both-,' you know, its like, 'Why bother? Why,' you know, 'its not just not going to pay off.' Um, there, you know the social-emotional trajectories are um, are deeply worrisome, they're are lots of psychological symptoms, there's a lot of anecdotal evidence of suicide rates, um, going up with, especially with kids that are facing deportation. Who just don't see, you know they have no ties to the homes that they're um, you know, the so called homes they're being sent to. Um, there a, you know, issues of compromise social belongingness, how do you belo-, how do you feel you can belong to a country that is so actively rejecting you? Um, and, you know, complications in identity formation, um, civic engagement is a really interesting outcome to be thinking about. On one, one theory, i-, would be, 'Well, you know, wha-,' obviously they can't vote, uh, but that's only one way to think about civic engagement. You can be engaged in lots of other ways. You can be active, you know, in a, so, one theory is you'll be less active if you feel like there's, you can't make a difference. Another theory is think about civil rights movement, and the African American community. It can be, it can be a moti-, this is a social justice issue. This is a civil rights issue. And people can get very mobilized. In some of our initial interviews with, uh, young people we're finding that it is truly a mobilizing uh, kind of issue. Um, so, that's a, a really interesting out-, outcome to look at. And then of course restrictive uh, labor market. Uh, access, you know people are deeply, deeply under uh, under employed. I, and I made those two in red, simply because those are the ones with the most research. Um, and then I'm just gonna briefly say two more words, and then I will turn it over to Marcelo. But we need to look, start looking beyond the issues of unauthorized adults. Uh, because it's not just an unauthorized issue, adult issue. Um, this is a child well-being issue as well. We need to think about this not only as a Latino issue, although it is disproportionally hitting the Latino community, but it crosses across all immigrant groups. 

01:06:00
Research Recommendation Need to start looking beyond unauthorized adults alone This is not a Latino issue This is not solely a Dream Act issue We need to think of this: Across children and youth's development trajectory Across contexts of development Across development outcomes Presents a number of ethical challenges. 

01:06:00
CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO We think we need to think about this not solely as a Dream Act issue, although that's an important first step. And we need to think of this across children youth development trajectories, across contexts of development, across developmental outcomes, um, and, but I also want to caution us to, to realize that it presents a number of ethical challenges as we move forward trying to do research in this area. And in, the, we need to do creative uh, implementation of mixed methods of strategies with a strict commitment to the protection of our participants. Thank you. 

01:06:40
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO It's just, very, very quickly, um, when it comes to immigration you have to proceed with caution. 

01:06:50
SHOULD THIS BE OUR PREVAILING NATIONAL MESSAGE? CAUTION 

01:06:50
MARCELO M. SUAREZ-OROZCO Immigration changes everything. It changes the countries where immigrants originate, it changes the new societies, and above all it changes the immigrants, and the communities where they settle. We have an attainable situation, a policy context that has splashed 5.5 million children through no fault of their own in a state of permanent liminality and compromised belonging. This is society the long term implications of finally establishing a cast like condition. Where children are being educated through their primary and, uh, through their elementary, secondary, and in some states, although this is rapidly changing, the college, yet at taxpayers expense, immigration generates economic surplus for the US economy that they don't very very robust. The costs that immigration incurs, the vast most important ticket in the costs of immigration is the education of the children of immigrants. We're educating children, yet at the end of the story today, it is a felony for these educated children, these children that are graduating from our, from our highschools and from our college, to make the transition to the labor market. If we think of education, us, a, the fundamental tool for the flourishing, the old aristotelian idea of il demonia. The old aristotelian of education as a tool for the full flourishing of human being, of the human being. If you, we look at the state, the constitution of the State of New York, where the right to a public education enters into our discursive practice as a fundamental tool of citizenship. It is only an educated citizenry. I think actually Horace Mann says that in your little entry note here at the EC. It is only an educated citizenry that can fully manage the affairs of the times. If we think about education as a transition to the labor market, where citizens can be-, begin to as Freud beautifully put it, 'Love and work.' Meaning to give back to the societies that nurtured them. How can we be today putting aside the dreams, the expectations, the ambitions, the drive of millions of children who find themselves through no agency, through no faul-, fault of their own, at the margins of the law. I leave you with that question. Thank you very much.
