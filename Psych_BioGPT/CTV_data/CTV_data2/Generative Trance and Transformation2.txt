BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Good afternoon everybody. Nice to not see you all. Uh-hmm, and, ah, this is Tracy and, uhm, we just met yesterday. Uhm, Tracy was in a workshop I was doing yesterday afternoon and, uhm, I did a demo in the workshop and she said, "Ain't you gonna another demo in the workshop?" And I said, "I don't know but I'll need a volunteer, uhm, for the, the demo on here today." She said and look a little bit shocked and then said, "Okay, I'll do it." So welcome, welcome Tracy. 

00:00:35
TRACY Thank you. Thank you. It's an honor. 

00:00:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I hope you can feel the support of everybody here. This is a good work. So I think we'll probably-- I mean, the, the topic of the demonstration is generative trance and I've been doing this work for about 40 years and started with Milton Erickson. And I heard Tracy is now studying with one of Milton Erickson's daughters in, in Dallas. And, uhm, the nice thing about trance is it allows you to sort of let go of all the busyness, all of the orienting response of what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, which really, I think fixes us and, and puts us in this limited box, if you will. And disconnects us from all the resources of, of our own self and also the, the greater resources are our ancestors, our, our community, and so forth and so on. The tradition in hypnotic trance, however, has been one in which the creative unconscious is invited to open but often, the conscious mind which we might call the social cognitive self aware presents is often put to sleep. The word hypnosis, of course, is from the Greek word for sleep or dissociated, or bypass and generally, I think that is a, a problem because it is sort of opens one space and closes the other. I think really for a creative life that we need to have a connection with both types of intelligence, both, both minds if you will which, which in trance what we call the conscious and the unconscious. So I hope, when I say generative trance, it's, it's working with trance but also looking to have this dimension of, of, uhm, what is often called today mindfulness. 

00:02:40
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:02:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-huh, which is to have this nonreactive awareness to be able to, to witness, to see what's there in your thinking, in your feeling, your dreams, your memories but to not have this reactive response. 

00:02:55
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:02:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN But rather have this response which was the essence of Erickson's work which is to have genuine curiosity, you know, in terms of that's interesting. You know, I'm sure that make sense. Something is trying to wake up inside of me and so I would have like to welcome it and create a nice space within myself so I could welcome as a positive contributor anything that comes up in, in my life. So I hope that, ah, we have an opportunity to explore that in a meaningful way for you, Tracy. Uhm, I've mention before, now, I just wanna reiterate publicly that, uhm, you have my commitment to support you in the deepest way possible so that whatever you sense your journey to be, I mean your, your highest path, uhm, that what we do here can really support you, ah, in doing that to the fullest so welcome. 

00:04:10
TRACY Thank you. Thank you. 

00:04:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So we only talk, ah, a very briefly but if, if there was one positive goal that you would like to set for the work here today, what might that be. 

00:04:30
TRACY Ah, well like you mentioned, uhm, being able to open that creative part in me. Uhm, I want to, ah, I'm in school to, to be a therapist and, uhm,... 

00:04:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You're an a graduate of a program in counseling. 

00:04:40
TRACY Ah, yeah. Yes. 

00:04:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, that's great. 

00:04:45
TRACY And I want to, uhm, use that gift to help others heal themselves and become more whole. 

00:04:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great. 

00:04:55
TRACY So I want them to be able to, ah, get in touch with that creative side in me that helps. 

00:05:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. And what would you say when you go to do that because I, I assume that this isn't the first time that you recognize that, that positive interest in your life. What, what would be the, the thing that you'd say stops you or seems to hold you back, you know, from being able to, to walk down that positive creative path? 

00:05:25
TRACY Uhm, I feel a burden of responsibility to others, uhm, but mostly my family. I'm burdened with, uhm, making sure everyone is happy and - 

00:05:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:05:40
TRACY - pleased and - 

00:05:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:05:40
TRACY - not that I want-- I maybe saying the same thing but I don't necessary need to please them. I just want-- I feel it's my responsibility to make them happy but that's not true. I know, I know it was not in me. 

00:05:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, okay. So on the one hand, you, you want to be able to this creative work in the world. 

00:06:05
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:06:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And on the other hand, is sometimes get held back by feeling this sort of burden - 

00:06:10
TRACY Yeah. 

00:06:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN - that, that holds you down. 

00:06:15
TRACY Uh-hmm, what if, what if I can't? What if I can't help them? What if? 

00:06:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So what, what I'd like to you, ah, ask you as, ah, we could do something called, ah, that I call somatic modeling. And by somatic modeling, we, we strip away all the, the words because the thought can get, you know, they've got a lot of judgements or fixed meanings in them to really sense what at core level sort of it at the creative archetypal unconscious level. What each of those parts of you, how they represent in, in, in your somatic experience, your body experience. 

00:06:55
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:06:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So it might seem, I don't know, maybe it doesn't seem strange but, uhm, what I'd to invite you to do is to, ah, for that, that positive intension. If you were to show me a posture and a movement that would represent-- that's what I mean by a somatic model. You say, well, this part of me that wants to do this creative, here's that-- here's how I would be sitting here. This would me my posture enough. There was a simple movement. Would it be like this or like this, or like this. 

00:07:35
TRACY To being, being creative - 

00:07:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:07:35
TRACY - it would probably be. 

00:07:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You like that one, huh? 

00:07:40
TRACY Yeah. 

00:07:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great. Where does that come from? 

00:07:45
TRACY Uhm, my heart. 

00:07:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It came from your heart. 

00:07:45
TRACY Uh-huh. 

00:07:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's interesting. 

00:07:50
TRACY Why is that interesting? 

00:07:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Well, that, that something would come right from here rather than from here. 

00:08:00
TRACY You've asked me to feel it. 

00:08:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I asked you to show me a representation. 

00:08:05
TRACY Okay. 

00:08:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's sort of an embody image. I mean, you know - 

00:08:10
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:08:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN - to have a notion that some of the that you're thinking comes from here and some of your thinking comes from here. 

00:08:20
TRACY Yeah. 

00:08:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Some of your thinking may be comes from here. 

00:08:20
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:08:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And maybe some of your thinking comes from here. Don't you find that interesting? 

00:08:25
TRACY I do. 

00:08:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So that-- that's a representation. This is something I want to be in the world. I ask you to do it a couple of times slowly and to not only do it with a feeling in your heart, right? Maybe, just take a few moments to slowdown. 

00:08:55
TRACY It's hard for me. 

00:09:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I could, I could feel that. Do you think you'd like to relax your toes first? Don't you find relaxing your toes is also interesting? 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And, of course, the reason that I'm inviting you to do that. You know, in every culture that I have asked and I've now asked in 20 different cultures, do you have the story in your culture? Do you tell your children the story of the race between the turtle and the rabbit? You know, there really fast animal and there really slow animal. Do you know how many yeses I've gotten out of 20? 

00:09:50
TRACY Probably, a lot. That's... 

00:09:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Twenty. 

00:09:50
TRACY Yeah. Oh, wow! 

00:09:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Twenty out of 20 cultures everywhere, they nods their heads said, "Yeah, we tell our children the story." Isn't that amazing? Ah, it seems to be universal. That's so important that it's in every cultural tradition. That you point out there's the rabbit mind. 

00:10:15
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:10:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's the ones driving in the car, you know, it's like with George Carlin, the American comedian is to say, "Why is that everybody driving 5 miles slower is an idiot and 5 miles faster is a maniac?" Uh-hmm. 

00:10:30
TRACY Yes, and the story we had in, in our family we say, ah, "Slow and steady." 

00:10:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Slow and steady. 

00:10:40
TRACY Slow and steady. Uhm... 

00:10:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

00:10:40
TRACY Keep, keep your face, ah, quick and, quick and something smash your face. 

00:10:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. So in the scale of one to 10, how relax are your toes? 

00:10:55
TRACY Oh, my toes, uh-hmm, they're relax. 

00:10:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That was... 

00:10:55
TRACY Nine, nine. 

00:11:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And where do that number came from? 

00:11:00
TRACY My head. 

00:11:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's interesting and if you ask the number to come from your toes, just notice what number would come from your toes. 

00:11:20
TRACY Nine. 

00:11:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN A nine. 

00:11:20
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:11:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So from that place, I would just invite you to listen to your body, it has such deep wisdom. In terms of how to have a sense of who you are and what you want to most create in your life. And now, in terms of that somatic model, this is if you can do it little bit slower. Just feel from head to toe. You can do it with your eyes open or close. Let's say, you just do it in your body-- would you like to close your eyes as for few moments? Say something about what I want most in my life as to do with this movement in my body. And as you breathe, that's good. As you feel your fingers moving and maybe the toes will join the movement as well. And I wouldn't know if your toes are moving cuz they're inside of your boots but you can feel. What it's like to let yourself move and find in your body before your thinking without having to verbally do anything about it? You can be able to sense that's good. That's good. Not really starts so deep into to wisdom of your body and that really is interesting. Don't you think that you've been given such wisdom, such amazing intelligence? And trance is just an opportunity to listen and to feel the roots of your bodily intelligence. So that everything in your mind, everything in your thinking can gently align and become very, very friendly with what your body most wants to do with it most, wants to create in terms of your positive presence in the world. And you feel that and get to know that and then, when you're ready, you take a breath and open your eyes and come on back out and we can talk about that a little bit and what did you notice there? 

00:14:55
TRACY Pink. 

00:15:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry? 

00:15:00
TRACY The color pink. 

00:15:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Color pink, that's fantastic. Isn't that interesting? And where a pray tell was pink? Inside, outside, all around, above you, below you? 

00:15:15
TRACY Inside. Inside. 

00:15:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Inside. Where inside? 

00:15:20
TRACY I don't know. 

00:15:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You don't know. 

00:15:25
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:15:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Would you like to find out exactly - 

00:15:30
TRACY Sure. 

00:15:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN - where pink is inside of you? You can take a breath and close your eyes again so you get to know not only the feelings but the color. And now, they really so deeply connect with your actual body, with all the muscles and the cells and the organs. So that beautiful marriage can begin to develop between everything that you feel, everything that you see and beautiful breathing, rhythm inside the body that moves in the world freely, comfortably, happily. Uh-hmm, that's good. And then, when you're ready you can open your eyes again. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:16:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What did you discover there? 

00:17:00
TRACY If where the color was. 

00:17:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:17:00
TRACY In around my heart. 

00:17:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, that's interesting. So start it with the sense there's something you really want to be doing in the world and as you tune in to that, once again, just take them with the senses at the same awareness as at the same understanding as it change that thing has been added to it as you sense the sort of mantra of sorts what I most want to do with my life is. Aren't you feel the slowing down and the pink and the breathing changing. Just notice your response to that question now, is it the same? Is it the same? That's good. 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Is there anything else? 

00:18:25
TRACY Well, it's all about making the world, uhm, a better place for people. 

00:18:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:30
TRACY It's not a, it's not a perfect world and just helping people make it through. 

00:18:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And where did that answer come from? 

00:18:45
TRACY My heart. 

00:18:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And can you tell me what happens to the color pink? When you hold that thought does it and really sense that what you think it should be? 

00:19:00
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:19:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Well, what it actually is? Does it increase? 

00:19:05
TRACY It decreases. 

00:19:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Ah, it's good to know. So if we were to ask that color pink for its answer so it's good to know that you have so many different parts of you. 

00:19:25
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:19:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I want to ask, let's listen to the color pink in your heart. Would that be okay? 

00:19:35
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:19:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Let's say what would you most want to be doing? I mean just relax your forehead, soften your eyes, sense what happens that whatever makes the color pink a little bit brighter, a little bit deeper, a little bit greater. 

00:20:05
TRACY A little bit what? 

00:20:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Greater, uh-hmm. Big-- bigger. 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:40
TRACY Knowing that people are will-- can be okay. 

00:20:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. Really just notice what happens to the feeling in your chest. One of the nice things about midlife, you know, Koryun used to say, "The first half of your life effectively belongs to other people." 

00:21:10
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:21:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You sort of living their needs, and what they want, and their values. And the second half of your life belongs to you. And so it's a process of getting to know your own voice and listening to what really comes most deeply from a place before words, from your true self, from your true spirit. Is it that interesting? 

00:21:50
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:21:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. Anything that you notice there. 

00:22:00
TRACY Explain. 

00:22:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hmm? 

00:22:05
TRACY E-- explain. 

00:22:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It sounds like Spock, for certain. 

00:22:10
TRACY Like where am I noticing. 

00:22:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you like Star Trek? That goddamn it's back? Don't you have any feeling at all? And Jim has to integrate both sides. 

00:22:30
TRACY Yes. 

00:22:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-hmm. Why do you think there's a good time to shift to-- we, we started with the sense of what I want most in the world is this? 

00:22:45
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:22:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN But when I go to get it, something like this happens. If I'm listening correctly and you can, you will correct if I'm not. It sounds like the other self started showing up. Uh-hmm. 

00:23:05
TRACY When I asked you, ah, yes probably. 

00:23:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So I'd like to welcome - 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN - the one that feels I shouldn't do it. I should just care about others. Uh-hmm, hi. Uh-hmm, hi. Wow, she's really interesting, huh? How old-- what a-- what number comes to your mind for her? 

00:23:50
TRACY Age? 

00:23:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yes. 

00:23:55
TRACY Oh, my gosh. Twenty-four. 

00:23:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Twenty-four. How old are you when you got married? 

00:24:05
TRACY Nineteen. 

00:24:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow, got right to it, uh? 

00:24:10
TRACY Out of the crib. 

00:24:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Out of the crib. Uh-hmm. So that other self that says no don't pay attention to what makes the feeling in your heart sing. 

00:24:25
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:24:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN She's really, really important, is she? 

00:24:30
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:24:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Can you just find what the somatic modeling for her might be? And so you're so, there's somebody what wants to do this - 

00:24:45
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:24:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then somebody else who does what? Scream. 

00:24:55
TRACY Feel a lot of weight. 

00:24:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN A lot of weight. 

00:24:55
TRACY I know I shouldn't carry it. 

00:25:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

00:25:00
TRACY I know I shouldn't carry it. 

00:25:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

00:25:05
TRACY But this sometimes is different. 

00:25:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So you really like to just take a few moments and make a space for that part of you and she could be initially standing over there. She could be behind you. Right. 

00:25:35
TRACY She's barely running back and forth getting - 

00:25:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN She's running back and forth. 

00:25:35
TRACY - getting stuff. 

00:25:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's, that's interesting. 

00:25:40
TRACY She's not standing still. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So do you think today is a good day - 

00:25:50
TRACY Uh-hmm. Yes, it is. 

00:25:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN - to start bringing her? 

00:25:55
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:26:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And please take a breath and close your eyes and just feel her running back and forth. Feel all the different ages connected with her. Sense all the different ways that she's really wanted to be free, wanted to run back and forth, and to appreciate all the ways that she just couldn't do that an earlier times. And as you breathe, you can feel all the ways that she moves from running back and forth to feeling burdened. To running back and forth again to feeling burdened that away. Take care of other people. How do I bring this feeling into my family? And to be able to sense that your present age, the compassion that you can have for her now. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And where in your body, in your heart, in your belly that you can give her a beautiful safe place so that she can be able to have all her childhood needs, her fears, her jubilance, her beautiful spirit, her confusion, her burdens. Ah, when you find that place inside to let her rest. Ah, that you can feel yourself as a woman begin to sense how you can best bring love into your family. While drawing that not only all of your hard earned wisdom but also when you breathe and you sense from your present creative maturity. I want to bring love into my family and I also want to be free, to be myself. And every time that you feel those younger traces, feeling that it's her job, you can just bring her into that place in the pink to let her run around, to let her know it's not her job. Whenever was, at least you give her that place to play, to run. When you touch her with all the love and the faith, and the kindness that allows her to just enjoy herself as a child. When she feel as a woman how you could be able to understand what it means to be a loving presence in the world in your family starting with yourself. And of course, we've all been flying on airplane listening to a flight attendant. At the beginning say that if there was any trouble, the oxygen mask will be released and make sure you put the mask on yourself first and for many of us, initially, is a rather confusing idea. How could you take care of yourself first? And of course, you think about just a little bit and it becomes rather obvious that feeling your own needs, feeling that place inside of you to be able to feel all those emotional needs and now you can enjoy letting that younger self feel your touch. Your loving presence, I'm here for you. I'm here. You can play, I'll take care of all the adult responsibilities and then to enjoy feeling that what an adult can feel that a child can't. Your own freedom, your own self awareness that allows you to receive and give in a very, very balanced way and so you can see trance's way of creating a very nice sanctuary, safe place. More of those parts of you that had felt so responsible and be able just to relax, and just to be able to learn to be free. And then to enjoy feeling that each moment that you feels completely free your spirit, your creative self that enjoys giving, sharing, receiving, and living the life that she most, most is fulfilled by. I'm gonna trance you'll earn that you've gone so many different changes over the years. Milton Erickson is to say that your values change so much over the years. What trust means to a 4-year-old to rather absolute limited understanding. What trust means to a 24-year-old? What trust means to woman that she goes through her own midlife trance formation? What self care means to an 8-year-old? What self care to a 20-year-old? What self care means in the creative wholeness of your present self? That's really nice to feel than find the faith to continue to be born again into a deeper self care, a deeper self love, a deeper freedom of your spirit and now from that authentic place, you really can contribute to others. Now just take a few moments to enjoy discovering what your creative wisdom teaches you, how it translates those ideas. Now you begin to listen not only to the feeling of the color pink but to the awareness of all the different parts of you that now have already been waiting to be held as with the sense of kindness, gentleness, happiness, and how the beauty of continuing to grow, and change, and mature really is about finding that sense. There's a place within you where you don't have to perform for others, where you can feel the love and fulfillment just by being completely there as yourself and having faith. There's a beautiful poem by the rather David Whyte about faith. This is I want to write about faith but I have no faith myself. Let this, then, my small poem like a new moon barely open be the first prayer that opens me to faith and knowing that everything is going to be okay. And it starts with that beautiful place I'm finding inside of you. A place to let it everything be as it is and if you hold the presences that just need to know I see you. I love you. I care for you. And to feel from that family inside just a beautiful capacity to live as a loving person in the world and to let other people know that you can do this too. You can find the place inside of you to start with self love and that everything follow from there and so whatever creative wisdom from whatever source has joined you and has joined us spiritually, emotionally, psychologically to help you in your healing, to help you in all the fear significant challenges. I'd like to say thank you to that presence and ask you to continue to guide you from the inside out and meeting a beautiful life of creative orders that always start with self love. And just notice any images, any feelings, any long forgotten memories, any symbols that that creative wisdom gives you as a sort of an anchor to remember, you can do this. You can live from this place in all of your relationships like you can feel through the images, through the memories, you can do this. And then when you're ready, Tracy, any gratitude that you would like to express to all of the positive presences that support you in your life that send you the love, that send you the support to live your life authentically. You can feel the sense of how to express gratitude and to appreciate that sense that when in the world you can stay connected to all of this in much, much more. 

00:44:20
[sil.] 

00:44:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then when you're ready, you can take a nice deep breath. Come back into the outer world with all that you have learned in your inner journey here today. 

00:44:55

STEPHEN GILLIGAN You have such a beautiful soul energy. Uhm, that's really, ah, uhm, a pleasure and privilege to be able to connect with it and feel it and, uhm, I really feel beautiful thing each time that you keep it for yourself first. Uhm, ever heard of the story of the lady of the well? 

00:45:45
TRACY Keep going. 

00:45:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN There's a, uhm, anthropologist. Her name is Angeles Arrien and, ah, she-- I heard her say that she found that in many, many different cultures, they had this story. It's story of a woman who lives on the edge of the village and as long as she could remember, she lived at the e-- at the edge of the village right next to a well. And as long as she could remember, everyday, people who come from the village and they would be carrying buckets and pails, bowls and what you and they would just get in line and they would hand her their bucket and their pail and that she would reach down into the well and fill it with the water and hand it to them. They would go off and all they long for as long as she could remember this happen. Until, finally one day, something happens and there-- there's different variations in different cultures but she gets ill or sick, or she realizes that she can't do it anymore. And she tells people to go away and then she goes inside and she goes through her healing journey and then, in her healing journey, she realizes who she really is and she is this archetypal, ah, lady of the well. And that the well contains all this healing waters but she realizes that her job is first to drink of the well deeply to nurture her own thirst, spiritual thirst, emotional thirst, and to be able to feed her own soul. And then, and only then, when she has completely nurtured herself, she has the option of sharing any overflow with other people. And this happens in people who come back but now the gift that the gives to others has a very, very, very different effect in the village. This people begin to discover this gift within themselves. So that is the story of the lady of the well. And I think you can sense why it shows up - 

00:48:15
TRACY Yes. 

00:48:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN - almost as often as the turtle and the rabbit. 

00:48:20
TRACY I like that one. 

00:48:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So what did anything you want to share about what happened in your experience? 

00:48:30
TRACY Well, I have this 24-year-old on my right hip because I carry my child-- or used to carry my children my hip. 

00:48:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right. 

00:48:35
TRACY So I didn't want her there. 

00:48:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

00:48:40
TRACY But she has to be on a hip. 

00:48:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

00:48:40
TRACY I don't know why. So she's on my right hip and, uhm, the color pink became brighter, ah, with a little shimmer to it. 

00:48:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's fantastic. 

00:48:55
TRACY And, ah, I, I guess this wisdom or ca-- can-- kind of came out of that was, ah, just unconditional love and so it doesn't matter around any of this. 

00:49:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN All right. 

00:49:15
TRACY Because unconditional love is forgiveness and, ah, it's okay and it's gonna be okay. 

00:49:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you know what they called people who felt that they had to heal their families' children? Therapist, hmm. 

00:49:40
TRACY I believe it. 

00:49:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Well, I, I really sense and that I send you a lot of support, you know. I, I would-- you know, it was my role in my family for many, many years and it took a lot of, uhm, realization of the damage that I caused to myself and to other people that I really love by not carrying for myself. That help me to realize that I have to let that child who felt so responsible have their place and to be able to take my place - 

00:50:15
TRACY Uh-hmm. 

00:50:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN - you know, in terms of, of self care. So, I, I, ah, feel that and, uhm, as a, ah, a brother on the path, I, ah, I send you lots and lots of support.
