RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, Rich Simon from Networker headquarters welcoming you to this webcast, attachment theory in action. So today we're gonna be talking about two very interesting developments in the field of psychotherapy, both of which have generated their share of controversy. One is attachment theory itself and as we've discussed in some of the previous installments of this webcast, there was a networker issue called the great attachment debate. We're gonna be talking about the actual events that originally sparked the great attachment debate so there's a little bit of drama here today, our guest today will, is an eye witness to the beginning of at least the public aspect of the great attachment debate and the other is this phenomenon of energy psychology that is increasingly coming into the mainstream of therapeutic practice and many therapists have been skeptical of energy psychology and the underlying promises and its effectiveness but more and more practitioners have begun to employ it and there's again, as our guest will also describe, some empirical base for energy psychology so we're gonna be talking about both these things and who better to join us, to help us in that conversation is David Feinstein who's quite versed in a number of things, amongst them attachment theory and has devoted this last stretch of his career to really try and bring energy psychology to therapeutic mainstream. David, how are you? 

00:01:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN Very good, Rich, good to be here. 

00:01:50
RICH SIMON So again, lot of ground here today and I think the best thing to do before we get into energy psychology and attachment theory, let's talk a bit about energy psychology and especially for people who may not be familiar with energy psychology, let's do, if you could, a brief tutorial, what is energy psychology and from your viewpoint, why should therapists be thinking about it? Why is it a useful tool to bring into therapeutic practice but to begin with, what is it and what does it involve? How does one use this in psychotherapy? 

00:02:30
DAVID FEINSTEIN It's a simple technique that is added to other protocols so you're working with somebody and you're still using talk therapy, you're still using different kinds of exposure methods but what you're introducing is in most energy psychology protocols, tapping on acupuncture points and that somatic intervention, that physical intervention is what distinguishes energy psychology from other methods and what the theory behind it with some empirical backing is that when you, when a person has unprocessed memories, when they have implicit memories that are coming through in their current behavior so they're in a situation and old fears or old beliefs or old images are kind of breaking through but they're not aware of quite what's going on so it's just effecting their behavior that those unprocessed memories can be processed in a number of ways. There's a number of things, like, such as exposure therapy is effective for changing ones relationship and really make changes in the inigula(ph) in the threat response area. The somatic interventions is more and more understood how they work so EMDR, and experiencing their own in some way bringing a shift to the way that the memories are coded and so a traumatic memory gets coded in the brain and then you for instance, tap on some acupuncture points or do an eye roll back and forth or you tap bilaterally and one of the things that happens with any of those is that the touch to the upper part of your body creates a delta wave and makes it very powerful, very powerful delta wave which is the same kind of wave you have in sleep which helps process memories and that, about eight minutes of keeping that wave active will shift the will actually eradicate what's called the word in neurology is depotentiate(ph) the memory pathway so you have a very powerful change that you can create very simply by number one, activating memory and number two, doing the physical intervention. There was an article just last month by Harper who wrote in traumatology, he had initially been studying how this works with EMDR and then he started looking at other sensory inputs and found, wow just about anywheres on the top half of the body so that's one of the things that energy psychology does is it rides that wave. 

00:05:50
RICH SIMON Well let me just, another way is it would seem part of what is both intriguing about energy psychology and part of what is puzzling to people, it is a until recently, I think whether we have more of a basis for understanding possible brain mechanisms by which changes, the mechanism by which it operates is totally outside the framework of what most people would consider until recently at least, psychotherapy and so things that would seem tremendously complex or the borese(ph) processes in energy psychology not no one's claiming this happens 100% of the time but there are these startling, these case examples and when you've been collecting some empirical evidence that with some regularity, we can make these changes and we don't have to talk about it, we don't have to have a relationship of trust and acceptance with a psychotherapist that at least some of the time with certain difficulties, what seems like a very simple and mechanical procedure can make profound change. 

00:07:05
DAVID FEINSTEIN And treat as a fairly conventional psychotherapist, I had a lot of trouble believing it. It took me a long time (crosstalk) Yeah, I you know, I had to witness it, I had to see it, I was already, my wife is an energy healer down at Eaton and I was hanging out in those circles and very skeptical and it, we've been together for 35 years and for our first 19 years, I was her biggest skeptic in some ways. I mean, I saw that she was getting results but the explanation that they were coming from energy somehow were just over my head or under my radar and we teach together and we were at a workshop and there was a group there of therapists who were studying with her and they persuading me to come to a demonstration of an energy psychology session in a group for therapists and someone with a really severe claustrophobia all their life in 20 minutes of this tapping and she was able to test it asked her to get into a closet and told her, you know, as soon as you feel any anxiety, let us know, we're not trying to retraumatize you, we'll open the door and she just went in there and just stayed and stayed and stayed until we got to yanking her out. She was so excited that it worked and now (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
RICH SIMON Well, I thought that therapists weren't supposed to help their clients go back into the closet but apparently the energy psychology works in these mysterious ways. So that's, and I would just point out that Dave wrote a great piece for the Networker that we will, is part of the learning resources for this course where he charts his own journey of skepticism and how he has come to embrace energy psychology so I think we'll at the moment let's move onto this latest installment but I think (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
DAVID FEINSTEIN Before we get started I just want to finish one piece of it on the neurological side because I think it's very interesting which is that for a dozen years there's been an ongoing researching project at Harvard Medical School on acupuncture and looking at, okay, what happens in the body as you look through imaging, through PET scans or MRIs when you stimulate a particular acupuncture point and there's a whole set of points that their effect is to decrease an arousal in the emigula(ph) and that is a very key finding for why I think that energy psychology may have an edge over some of the other somatic therapies because what you do is you have the person bring to mind something that's traumatic and so the emigula goes into a threat response and then you tap on these points that decrease the arousal so you have this kind of brain scanning opposite messages and as you keep decreasing the arousal, if you keep sending that message and the arousal goes down, while still holding the threatening scene, this becomes the new normal. This is the, you know, the cortisol's not bumping, the hypacantus(ph) can go into action and then recognize, okay, this is happening, we're thinking this scene and there is no threat response here so that begins to become integrated so in a way that's how all of this works at those two levels. The (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
RICH SIMON By the way those people who are just tuning in late, we are not watching the muppets here on the Networker webcast. Those were two parts of the brain that was demonstrating. Okay so that's, and there's more about that and more about the understanding of the possible neurobiological mechanisms by which acupuncture, both acupuncture and tapping and energy psychology works in David's terrific piece and you can see this on the Networker website. So let's end the tutorial there and there's a lot more to be said about that but let's get into the main topic for today's discussion so which is energy psychology and attachment theory and addressing early attachment injury and it seems like you came at it, I guess, really it turns out simultaneously to me and many of us at an understanding of this and why this issue is, might be so central for psychotherapy at more places. The Networker symposium back in 2010 and you had a front row seat on what happened there. We haven't talked about that so far in this series. Can you tell us what took place there that year that really brought attachment theory into the radar of at least people at that conference and since then I think many many more psychotherapists were certainly more aware of it beforehand. 

00:12:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well, I had Bolby's three volumes on attachment theory on my bookshelf since the 70's and never really looked at it and just it sounded like an interesting, important idea but there's just so many places your attention can go and Nancy Go and Jerome Keegan were at the Networker and each gave talks and then they also when Jerome Keegan was giving his talk, Dan was in the audience and Jerome made some comments about the research on attachment theory and saying that you know, really discounting the validity of attachment theory and Dan felt that he could not allow that to be left unchallenged and got up and looked for a microphone to for the audience, there was none so he kind of popped up onto the stage and grabbed the microphone up there. They knew each other but it was kind of atypical and... 

00:14:00
RICK SIMON High drama. 

00:14:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN It was very high drama. And so Dan, you know, posed the question have you read the research and Dr. Keegan assured him that he had and that was the beginning of the debate that psychotherapy Networker, by the way I wanted to compliment you on that issue of the great attachment debate, fabulous issue but it, for me and I think for many people, it brought onto the center of our screen, the possible importance of attachment theory and so it renewed my interest in it and the people that were using what I call attachment informed psychotherapy like there's a number of them that were actually speaking at the Networker about it, I've spoken to the last few years on, like Mary Ann Solomon Stan Tagtan and there and of course Susan Johnson and their work is just so profound, couples therapy has got it's challenges obviously and to have a map that really guides the therapists to what's happening beneath the surface beneath all this screaming and chip at the, and hurt and you know, people that love each other damaging each there right in front of your eyes, is there a map of what's going on that can be useful for the therapist. 

00:15:40
RICH SIMON So the point that, and let me just land on a couple of things that you're saying and let's, and then I'll be very interested in hearing more about your work but first of all, and again that's a description of that encounter, highly charged and dramatic and important intellectually important encounter between Dan Segal and Jerome Keegan is part of the reading for this course so people can access that and there was a great overview piece by Mary Wiley and also a piece by Dan and Allan Schroff, one side of the debate, Jerome Keegan on the other that you can access as part of this course and then the other thing that became clearer. Following that is that folks like Sue Johnson and others that, for them, attachment theory was almost like that the subtext, a whole subtext of psychotherapy that was not understandable if you simply had a cognitive or behavioral perspective, that the stakes particularly in couples therapy and all kinds of therapy are incredible high in the consulting room and attachment theory, I don't know if it provided a clinical road map but it provided a way of understanding what is this subtext, what are these people arguing about, what are the life and death issues that seem to be at stake so often in psychotherapy and attachment theory finally, for many people, gave voice to what was at stake and what those concerns were about. So, you got, I don't know if it inspired you to fully re-explore the three volumes of Bolby that you had been so studiously ignoring like many of us had because many of us knew the name of Bolby and you, a short answer on a lot of quizzes, oh yeah Bolby but I heard that before and other language but you went home from that and you did something that most people maybe didn't do which is really immerse yourself and exploring these ideas and their clinical applications. What happened, what did you do? 

00:17:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well in some ways the ideas are not new for seasoned psychotherapists that the early experiences have a big impact on what happens in relationships. That was already clear since Freud but what the attachment theory, it was to map the way that works and to map the way it works in the brain and particularly Dan Segal's interpersonal neurobiology is sort of the brain side of attachment theory and so it intellectually was a lot more satisfying, a lot more solid than psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theory so he had more of a foundation to work with and but… 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON It had a scientific concept and the metaphors of Freud and of early psychodynamic theory. 

00:18:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN Right and so what he had happening is from early childhood experiences that internal working models were formed that shaped relationships in later life and the question became when those internal working models were dysfunctional, how do you change them and so Sue Johnson, actually a lot of people but Sue Johnson has just been so clear in spelling it out, has a way of creating what she calls, emotionally corrective experiences in the consulting room and it working, it's watching very carefully and a great deal with too much to what each partner's doing in both verbally and in obvious ways but also in the more subtle ways that emotions express themselves so that there may be two message coming, one with what they're saying and the other what's happening in their breathing and in their facial coloring and so by being attuned to all of that it's possible to recreate an experience where the patterns that go on and on and on and that for many people, do not change throughout their lives are able to be stopped and confronted and then done in a different way so the person has the visceral experience of a new behavior leading to a new outcome and that's an emotionally correct experience and it takes a lot of clinical skills to do well but it can be done, it's being done, it's being taught, it's not something that just Susan or Dan's genius, they're able to teach people how to do these kinds of things and so you really have a very practical way now to work with these internal models that are, you know, very elusive, we can understand a little bit about the neurology of them but where do you point and (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
RICH SIMON Let me just underline one thing about what you're saving David. It seems very important is that, these models, relation that the instrument of change is relationship, it's a slow process, it involves the therapist establishing the conditions for secure attachment in the treatment room, about safety, it's about this slow incremental back and forth between therapist and client over time and the tolerance of primary emotions and individual vulnerability and there's a whole world and different ways of approaching that but lots of people are talking about that, that's on the one hand and then let's move into the contrast here of what you explored through a very different mechanism of change. 

00:21:55
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well it occurred to me that what they were doing in between the partners to be done inside the brain of each partner and very quickly one of the strengths of energy psychology is its speed and precision. So it's precision is based on the kinds of statements that you make to create the inner images that you're working with and the speed is what I was talking about earlier of the tapping on the acupuncture points, sending signals directly to the emigdula(ph) so right there in the moment the entire landscape of the brain is changing around the issue that the person is thinking about so I thought, well, what if rather than, or not instead of but as a step towards getting the couples to have that emotionally corrective experiences between each other we could shorten it by first having what I call an internal emotionally corrective experience where you very quickly start with what, recognize, okay, what is the underlying theme here in, you know, couples therapists figure that out pretty fast, they can kind of watch what people that are arguing about all the time, the issue that just don't seem to go away, what are they presenting in the office that, those kinds of things, and there's generally some themes there that are repetitive and that as you get a handle on those things that are often very basic, one person is extremely sensitive to criticism and hears criticism no matter what the partner says, no matter how well they say it, no matter how lovingly they say it, it's heard as criticism and you can very quickly then, first thing you can do is that you can take a recent incident between them often it's what happened right there In the office, you just freeze it and then you have the person that reacted just begin to tap while remembering what just happened or often it will be something that happened during the week that they come in presenting and you tap that down and it will decrease the amount of arousal the person has as they think about that situation and somewhat it will decrease the arousal that they have in future situations but most often you need to go back into time to a formative experience that kind of set them up for this reaction so. 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON So let me ask you as we, to get people the flavor of how you, so as you began to do this can you think of a case, a couple or otherwise, where you began to, okay let me see if I can change this pattern by using tapping and seeing if I can get this internally emotionally corrective experience and what exactly, what was happening, what she said, and exactly just give people a little bit of that process of how you used it. 

00:25:20
DAVID FEINSTEIN A couple that were both in their second marriage, the woman had two children and the new dad was doing well in many ways, there were, he really cared about these kids and he was bonding to them and he was though having a reaction that was so irrational and so strong that it was getting in the way of the whole family and that was that the boys, the two boys, their dad visited every Sunday and the new dad was just insanely jealous about the old dad and he knew that, I mean he believed that the marriage was over, the relationship was over, he believed that the wife loved him he, separate from this he was grateful for the way that he had entered these boys' lives and was making a difference but when Sunday was coming he was finding himself anxious and he was unable to restrain himself from making really derogative comments about the boys' father. It got the couple into argument after argument and it was just not getting better, it would seem that he would've kind of grasped this, that this was not appropriate. 

00:26:55
RICH SIMON So there's a part of this guy at least, that recognized that this that he wasn't 100%, that there was, that he was reacting in a way that was above and beyond the circumstance so but whatever the other part of him was thinking so what did he say? How did he describe the fact that he got so worked up about this even though he didn't have no indication that this guy was any, the ex husband was any threat to him. 

00:27:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well, as often happens in those cases even though a part of him was aware he was irrational, part of him really perceived the husband as being you know, bad for the kids and making errors as being inappropriate towards his ex wife, there were, you know, there were a lot of rationalization for keeping his position and so where I started was his, to the degree to which I could align with him, or the part of him that was saying, okay, I may be overreacting a little bit here was to start with the overreacting and so having him bring to mind the husband walking up the driveway to pick up the kids and while he does that, to go through the tapping on the various acupuncture points that are worked with in the (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
RICH SIMON Let me pause for a second. How do you, so this is part of the thing that I think people are interested in, so how do you introduce that? What is it, this is not something most people are inclined to associate with conventional psychotherapy so how do you even introduce the idea that you're going to do this? 

00:28:40
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well usually I don't because people often come to me because they know that I do use this, that's often the reason that they come to me but if the languaging is real important. It depends a lot on the client's frame of reference so if the person, like a lot of people in my world are kind of open to alternative healing and that kind of thing, I can speak very comfortably about acupuncture points and talk, you know, and use that framework. If you know, I'll give an example of working in a disaster area where you have you know, 30 seconds to establish rapport if someone is, just, you know after a disaster, they're really in a lot of distress, obvious distress it would not be unusual for a therapist who is there not to do therapy but to just help give comfort, it's way too early to do therapy, so they're there to give comfort, it would not be unusual to say, if you'll just breathe along with me, you're gonna feel better so that's how I might start with that person. Just say, okay, and do some diaphragmatic breathing, get them to go along with that and then I might say, there are also some trigger points that help the body to relax so as you continue to breathe, just tap along with me on these trigger points and that very quickly will help the person to relax. So, now I might talk about trigger points that reduce anxiety or trigger points that make a situation where a person reacts strongly to calm their whole nervous system in that situation so I can be very, fairly conventional language or I can be, you know, a little bit more esoteric depending on the contents so in this case they were familiar with this, this was not the first time that I introduced the tapping so it was simply a matter of having him go into the recent memory of the husband walking up the driveway and doing some and before that, you give him the standard zero to ten rating of the amount of distress it causes in body and mind right now. It won't be MDR sees a lot, and so he gives a rating to it and it's a ten, it's really, really strong, it's kind of you know, he's seeing purple when this happens and so we do some tapping and the basic protocol is you do a round of tapping which takes about a minute and then you do some what's called a nine gamma procedure which is it's got nine steps and it involves tapping but it also involves some eye movement, different in theory at least in MDRs eye movement but it's still eye movement and some counting and humming. The theory in energy psychology though no one's proven it is that what this does is it helps integrate the left and right brain hemisphere so it gets the two sides of the brain to coordinate better. The other thing I think it does is it brings you away from the situation for a couple of minutes so it gives the person at the psyche level a chance to integrate what's been happening so I think it does some integration experiment with different techniques, different somatic techniques, energy medicine techniques and they seem to me to work as well as the nine gamma but that's up for debate. But so you do a round of tapping for about a minute, you do the nine gamma for a minute or two, then you do another round of tapping and then you have the person rate again, the (crosstalk) distress, yes, and so that rating usually in my experience, has gone down a bit and it might have gone down from a ten to an eight okay, so with this guy it wasn't going down very fast and when that's happening the the therapist has a number of choices, one of which, and my favorite is to use that time of looking for the subjective unit of distress as a time for really becoming really mindful ‘cuz it's kind of a mindful-less technique a meaning mindfulness technique where the person is scanning their sensations, scanning their emotions, scanning any thoughts that are there just noticing and if I'm kind of feeling like, okay, this isn't going anywhere, I will, as I did in this case, use that to say, okay, from that emotion of anger that you're feeling right now, that you just described, imagine that that's a bridge, it's a hypnosis technique actually called the affect bridge, imagine that's a bridge and take it back to one of the first times that you felt this feeling, okay? So pop, it comes up, he says I'm ten and I'm an only child and I'm really happy with my parents and my family and then my parents decide to take on a foster child and the foster child is a very troubled boy and for the next period of my life, I forget how long it was, that's where all the attention went, my parents had given me all the attention. I was an only child for 10 years and suddenly it was gone and that, he didn't make the connection at that moment between them, the current situation, that's just what popped into his mind so we explored the feelings that he had about that and he hadn't thought about that for years, you know but it was down there as an inclusive memory so we begin to identify the feelings around that and he just felt abandoned, he felt lost and really angry towards the other boy and towards his parents but he never could express that because he was really well mannered, well behaved kid and he was trying to be so good so his parents would pay attention to him again so all that got stuffed down and so the tapping, you can work on each aspect of that to work on the feeling of hurt but you can also work on the repressed anger. 

00:36:00
RICH SIMON Let me just pause you for a second because it sounds like a very pregnant moment. His partner is there, she's watching as this is happening so just give us, it seems like a very intense moment, just pause for a moment, just kind of, what's going on in the room? So this guy is filled with this emotion that hasn't occurred to him in years and it's pouring out and she's watching in, what was going on, what was your experience? 

00:36:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well what's great about this, about these internal emotionally corrective experiences with the partner watching is the partner's empathy just goes up, up, up, up, you know, so the partner's getting it, she's saying, oh my god, he's not just being irrational, it's not just coming out of left field, there's a reason for this and so her, you know, I don't remember if her eyes were in tears but she was very emotionally moved by it. 

00:36:50
RICH SIMON Totally engaged with what's going on. 

00:36:50
DAVID FEINSTEIN Totally engaged, totally engaged and sympathetically engaged. So and he's of course totally into it so he's just immersed in the experience and then as these aspects of it are resolved one at a time through the tapping, and different practitioners kind of, are more or less strict. I tend to want to get each aspect of it down to a zero if I can and sometimes what you have to do is jump from one aspect to another then go back. 

00:37:35
RICH SIMON Aspect, what do you mean by aspect? 

00:37:35
DAVID FEINSTEIN So for instance one aspect would be the repressed anger, another aspect would be the hurt that he's feeling so different emotions that exist around the same situation. Aspects are, there are many, many different levels of aspects like, for instance, the situation of the husband walking up the driveway. This memory was an aspect of that original situation so the aspect may be something from the past or, for instance, in a car accident working with somebody that has had a trauma like that, an aspect, you might be working with it and get it from a ten down to a six, the memory of the accident and it won't go down further and one aspect could be that the person had had an earlier accident that had never been resolved so that's kind of coming out subconsciously and so you begin, get that out and often it will reveal itself once you get it down from, let's say a ten to a six, the person has more access to their memories. It's very interesting and I'm not sure exactly why but it will come during the week in a dream that will bring that memory to them so that's one aspect of going that route but another aspect, other aspects are sensory so you may be working with the automobile accident and the memory of the you know, seeing the car coming fast through the rearview mirror, bracing yourself, each of these is an aspect, having the collision occur, having the pieces after the collision, and you're just not getting it down all the way and then during the site you say, what else comes to mind and they say, oh, the smell of the burning tires and that was a big piece that they never articulated to you and so you never worked on it but it was big in their consolation of the accident so you work on that and then everything else goes down so in the case that we're talking about the aspect of each of the emotions was a different aspect of it so you get those down to a zero and then you come back to the father walking up the driveway and it's just a round or two of tapping and that's down to a zero. If that was, you know, if our hypothesis was right, that that was a key incident from the original experience. So there in the space of 20 or 30 minutes you have shifted this pattern that was just making so much havoc in the relationship so it's over. It's not gonna happen again. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
RICH SIMON So again, pause for a moment and what's going on with these people? So this, you know, this experience however tuned they are into alternative healing or something, this is not the sort of experience most of us have every day. What are they saying? How do they make sense of what was going on with this new husband, what was he saying to you? What did he tell you about his internal experience as he was going through this process? So he's doing this tapping, the focusing a certain way, he does some tapping, he checks in, he sees the level of distress, you see if there's something further that needs to be done, you're tracking him, you're tracking his non verbals, what else is going on or what is he saying (crosstalk)) 

00:41:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN The two responses that are most common are relief and amazement. People are really surprised that the last piece of the work, that section of the work is having kind of worked with the negative side of it, you then go to what Peter Gallow calls the projection exercise where you just take the situation and have the person imagine their ideal response in that situation so now we may have the husband having walked in the door and how does the man greet him and feel as he's greeting him so we have him imagine at first in the ideal and then we give a rating, zero to ten not of the son now but of how believable is it to you that you could actually go up and shake this man's hand and be interested in him and find out more about who it is that the kid's are spending their Sundays with and whatever, again, you let him create it but. 

00:42:40
RICH SIMON I would seem to be really important so he's, so you're drawing out from him what he would actually like to experience, okay. 

00:42:50
DAVID FEINSTEIN And then in the same way though, say that he's been at a zero in terms of, he can watch the father walking up the driveway but imaging himself greeting the father it's say maybe he reads it as a five in its believability and you want to get it up. So you just do more tapping and you do similar kinds of things but now instead of looking at the difficult emotions, you're imagining the scene as you would like it to be as you tap on that and nobody knows quite why it works but very quickly, they'll be up to an eight and what I found and others have found is that if you can get a person to an eight on that side of it, that's often as high as they're gonna go until they are actually in the experience and actually have the experience. Often they will go to a ten but often an eight is enough for them to then enter the experience (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON But do positive memories come up in just the other, when you were talking about the aspects earlier, were having perhaps, unpacking traumas or regrettable experiences that are somehow associated with each other that seem part of the response and as you do it you tap, does the same thing occur on this upside, where you're invoking this positive response that reminds them of perhaps other reconciliations he may have had in the past of other kinds of experiences that were positive for him. 

00:44:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN That's a great question and in the Networker article that is part of this course, there's a case example that's a beautiful illustration of that where Carolyn Sokai, who's a psychologist who was with orphans in Ruwanda (crosstalk) and the research on that was amazing because she did (inaudible ) and post testing on these kids and there were 388 orphans in this orphanage and nearly 200 of them could remember the genocide from 12 years earlier and were still having PTSD symptoms, they were still having flashbacks and nightmares and wetting their pants every night and being, you know, so she gave them, she was supposed to give them three sessions to the 50 that were the caregivers rated as the most troubled. The 50 of the 188 that were the most troubled and they were supposed to give three sessions, that was the design. There was an emergency out in the country so that half their team went of to address that emergency so they could only give one session and in that one session the kids, these 50 kids, all of them on the standardized measure rated above the PTSD cut off, 92% of them rated below the PTSD cut off after one session and she tells a story, and the story's recounted in the article, of a girl that was three during the, when she watched her parents being murdered with machetes, she saw her father killed and she had been in severe PTSD for 12 years since then and Carolyn talks, kind of gives you a rundown of the session of how she was able to go back to that scene, where she would see every day of her father being slaughtered and being able to hold that scene, it was still a horrible scene but she didn't go into the stress reaction and then, for the first time, she had positive memories about her family. She remembered how her father used to sneak these little candies in, give them to the kids when the mother wasn't looking and she just, and that was her report of the week that followed that she was having these memories that she never had of positive experiences with her parents and so that was just a dramatic example but to get back to a more typical way that this works is that when traumatic memories, when implicit memories are resolved, then the way that the whole memory is then integrated into the whole neuro network so that it becomes part of the resources that the person can draw on is a major change so that where it's been isolated and off here, you know Francie Shapiro really nails this when she talks, she talks really well about the way that this, really articulately about the way that this works so that this network of memories that we use to guide ourselves, our positive navigational system, the memory gets integrated into that so it happens at a conscious as well as unconscious level so you, it would not be typical, I don't remember that he said this but it would not be atypical for him to go back and have emerged in some moments during the time that the foster child was there where the parents where really affirmative towards him, really loving towards him. Those memories had been blocked out, then they become resources so that it shifts the person's self image. 

00:48:50
RICH SIMON Okay so yeah, so there's this, one of the things that trauma does and negative experiences, it compartmentalizes us, our world gets smaller. We hunker down to gird ourselves against the perceived danger and negativity and so what you're describing as that we let go of that there's this kind of broader wisdoms, more extensive sense of our resilience and our ability to handle stuff so we don't, so that the good and the ill and all of that we just become more interconnected and then so literally the representation of the past is changing so for this fellow, so tell us where did it go, what happened (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
DAVID FEINSTEIN Yeah,so, well, part of what happens after a session like this, ‘cuz for 28 years I was kind of the inside oriented psychodynamic sort of ying yang therapist and what I notice after energy psychology session is, when they're really successful and the person gets down to a zero and is able to imagine a new behavior is that the insights come flooding in that are so hard earned and talk psychotherapy that takes session after session after year after year and the person just understands what was going on in a whole new way, it becomes a non issue, he's able to laugh at himself, he's able to apologize to his wife for having been so difficult, he's able to say it's gonna be different now with absolute confidence and it was. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Well since you're saying that you're describing this in a, one of our earlier interviews, Bruce Ecker, who is, I don't know if you're familiar with Bruce's work, but he's describing a very similar process then so it's interesting, there are different methods but one of the, in this story he told us in his interview he talks about how this guy suddenly used the term how silly this previously highly negatively charged experience almost the same kind of words that you're describing and that you can look back on the same set of circumstances and the same story and it doesn't evoke the same, it doesn't, it's just not there anymore and in other languages like, well it happened to somebody else or (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN There was a long time ago, it's real common. 

00:51:25
RICH SIMON It's a common one also. And so, and then how enduring was this pattern? Did you see these folks, what kind of follow up did you do with this couple afterwards? 

00:51:35
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well they were working on other issues and, you know, some of the challenges of co parenting with a step parent but, and they did well but this was a particularly difficult stumbling block for them ‘cuz it was so irrational and the wife was having so much judgment about it that it was a major piece to work that through. The rest of the therapy was more coaching. It didn't have that sort of make it or break it feel like this issue did. 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON So, just to focus in here for the moment since our theme here is attachment theory and energy psychology, so there, so life is complicated. People need to learn new skills, they need to work on their relationship with each other so in terms of the way that you're using energy psychology to address attachment issues, is there some way you would characterize what you've discovered as you've been working on this, where it's effective and where it isn't a tool that perhaps is relevant as it is at other times? 

00:53:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN Right, well everything that you, as a therapist know about working with couples, you still use. You know, you still develop repore with each person, you still develop some kind of neutrality so that each partner can trust that you're able to be on their side and the side of the couple. You use good interviewing techniques, you invoke information from each person. Where you bring int he energy psychology is at the point where there is conflict that is emerging in the office or that they're reporting and that becomes an entry where you can, rather than teach communication skills and communication skills have gone out of style but a lot of therapists still use them. 

00:53:55
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) therapy process. 

00:54:00
DAVID FEINSTEIN So you can interrupt the process there and do the internal experience at the point of conflict at the point of repetitive beings that keep going on and on. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON You can't move the needle you just can't do it, you get stuck there again and again, let's try something else. 

00:54:25
DAVID FEINSTEIN Right. In often the person's narrative, shows themes that are there, that their attitudes towards women that come out in what they say and then you can also recognize, okay that's going on in this marriage or their attitude toward themselves and so you can work sort of individually we can, while at the same time having it in the couple's contents so that the partner is a witness to the word, develops a lot more understanding and empathy about what's going on in their relationship with their partner so very quickly moves you through these very sticky issues by being able to stop the motion when things get really heating up and go inside one of the partners and then afterwards, it didn't happen in the case we're talking about here but often when you know, there's two sides to most issues and so often after you resolve it with one person, you will see in the partner, that even though they were looking pretty squeaky clean, that they had a rule in maintaining it or we're getting some side benefits from their partner's symptoms and so that very often the complete resolution of the issue involves both of the partners being on the hot seat for a little while. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah the systemic perspective. Well, this seems, it's time ofr us to stop here of the moment and this is, I think now, is a good time, for the people who you've gotten our attention and people may not either understood energy psychology or skeptical about energy psychology, you've given your best shot at getting us intrigued with it and it's power to make a difference in your practice certainly. So where do people go if they want to find out more about your work and more about energy psychology? 

00:56:45
DAVID FEINSTEIN Well the Networker article that's part of this course which you made me rewrite 28 times is kind of refined itself a bit to. 

00:56:55
RICH SIMON David wrote that in blood ladies and gentlemen so you better be reading nothing else on this curriculum, read David's wonderful Networker piece on his journey from skepticism to embrace. 

00:57:10
DAVID FEINTSTEIN Our website is www.energypsyched.com energy P S Y C H ed .com and one really amazing thing on that website that I just posted it, I don't take credit for it is a excerpt of treatment, a video of 10 minutes of showing excerpts of treatment with for veterans that have severe PTSD and it's just very moving and makes the case very strong. Also there on the right hand lower side are David's most popular papers. One of them is the research and just last month the review general psychology which is a APA journal published article that I wrote that reviews 51 peer reviewed papers that talk about the outcome, all 51 of them show positive outcomes, 18 of them are (inaudible ) trials. We really analyzed those, we put them through some critical review and found that there's evidence now that's pretty strong which wasn't true you know, 40 years ago the evidence was much shakier. There's been 36 of those 51 articles have come out in the last four years so there's getting to be strong evidence that this works and so it's, even when I wrote the Networker article a couple of years ago, I was relying on my rhetorical skills more than being able to point to, hey, we have something solid here but there's something pretty solid and also a very good how-to book,, it's been called the best one out there, is called Promise of Energy Psychology, that's on our website, it's by myself, Donna Eaton and Gary Craig, the founder of EFT, which is the most popular forum of energy psychology and there's a video that goes along with that, introduction to energy psychology, those two are really good ways for clinicians to really get the basics of this. There are also trainings. We don't ourselves, I'm doing a five day training at omega in, later this month in upstate New York but for the most part the certification programs we don't run but ACEP, the association for comprehensive energy psychology which is energy psych org does programs and also EFT universe .com does an excellent training programs so there's a lot of resources that are available. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Okay, well great and as always we're inviting those of you who've been listening to the conversation at this point, join the conversation, you'll see on your screen a place for your comment board, what do you think of what you've been listening to here? What thoughts did it spark in you, what questions, what connections did you make between it perhaps cases you're seeing right now, whatever it is you care to, the important thing about these series is I keep saying that these conversations is not a conversation up here on the little screen but a conversation that this will set off out there in our wider professional community so please, for your own sake, put your thoughts down so you crystallize them for yourself, share them with the rest of us during the conversation and David, as gracious as always will go up and at the very least will take a look at the comment board if so moved very likely to respond and give it his eloquence and his commitment to spreading these ideas of energy psychology that would be quite an interesting exchange for us to, if that were to happen. David, speaking of your considerable rhetorical skills, well demonstrated here today, thank you so much. It's been very interesting to hear about your journey and where this work is taking you, the readers of the Networker and folks who go to the Networker symposium, you haven't heard the last of David Feinstein, I have no doubt. Thank you so much David. 

01:01:35
DAVID FEINTSTEIN Really a pleasure Rich, thank you so much. 

01:01:40
RICH SIMON That's it for now, see you next time with our next installment of attachment theory in action. Bye bye.
