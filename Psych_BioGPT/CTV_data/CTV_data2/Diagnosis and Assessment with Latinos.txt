"Diagnosis and Assessment with Latinos" - Margarita Francia, Ph.D. and Vivianna Padilla Martinez 

00:00:20
MARGARITA FRANCIA Well, I am very glad and honored to be, uh, giving this presentation, and I'm very thankful to Dr. Fred Leon, hope that he's getting well very soon, and all the organizers of this, um, multicultural symposium. And let us now, uh, share with you some of our thoughts and our, uh, knowledge regarding the assessment and diagnosis of the Latino population. Uh, we're, uh, the first slides that I'm going to share are a background on Latinos and some demographic data regarding that population, but I'm going through them very quickly since we are short of time. Well, the term "Latino" refers to, uh, it has been named about three decades ago, and it refers to a group that shares some, based on language and geographical provenance. This is not regarding racial definition because in fact "Latino" as a term refers to people from different countries. Like for example, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Peruvians, and Cubans, Ecuadorians, and they are called, we are called Latinos here in the States. This is a term that has been applied mostly here because when we've returned to our different countries, we are, uh, named after our country of origin. And even if we are, for example, in Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, or Argentina, how do we present our ethnic identity to ourselves and to others? I am Puerto Rican, for example, so this is, this only applies here in the States. And here there are some slides regarding that. There is really a significant variability in this social demographic characteristic of different Latino subgroups. For example, Puerto Ricans are more likely than other subgroups to be born in the United States, to spend more than 70% of their lifetime in the U.S. mainland, and to live, uh, in the Northeast. As a group, Puerto Ricans share these characteristics. Mexicans are more likely to be in the lowest income group and live in the West. And Cubans report higher household incomes and more education and are likely to spend like, 30% or less of their lifetimes in the U.S. as, uh, some of the data that we have recently researched. Um, regarding poverty, uh, 21.5% of Latinos in comparison to 8.2% of non-Latino whites were living at the poverty level according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Uh, in New York State specifically, 34% of Latinos under age 17 and 20% of Latinos aged 18 to 64 live also in poverty. So, uh, this is a very, a very important demographical characteristic to take into consideration when we're doing also, uh, assessment and diagnosis. Uh, what do we know? Latinos are the largest minority group nationwide, comprising 14% of the total population. It was data taken from the 2005. The rate of growth in Latinos in the United States has steadily be growing and growing. That's why it's so important to have spaces like this to share information and knowledge about them. Uh, and in 2000 it was 15.5%, and in 2010 it was projected to be 17.8%. And by 2050, as Nichole also showed some statistics, Latinos will be like, 29% of the population. Here is a graphic that shows in 100 years how Latinos have grown from, uh, four million to, projected to 155 million in, by 2050. Uh, the total population of Latinos in the U.S.A. totals right now over 50 million, making the second largest concentrations of Latinos in the whole world, only outnumbered by the Mexico's population of 122 million. So here in the States we have a great, great rate of them. Some of the disadvantages, um, Latino minorities often, very often develop in segregated contexts that are characterized by neighborhood disadvantage, poverty, low parental education, unemployment, and fragmented social networks. All of these variables also affect the family dynamics and the child development, and as we know, these are important, uh, predictors later of, uh, psychopathology or, or mental problems. So right now we're going to go on to the, our section of the assessments of Latinos. And why is this assessment important? As we had just told, Latinos are a growing, uh, steadily growing population here in the States, so it is very, very important to have, uh, qualified clinicians, as Nichole also spoke in her presentation, that are able to make accurate diagnoses and assessments to these populations. Uh, the question whether the tests that are used in assessment and the interview process that we are doing today is biased against ethnic minorities has been a topic that has been debated for many years, and it has been found, for example, some score differences between the ethnic groups that can be attributable to psychological assessment, and Latinos have also as, uh, the Black, uh, Americans have also scored, uh, uh, high on psychotic symptoms from measures as has been, uh, reported in some, uh, investigations. So reliable and valid assessments of Latinos, uh, needs to consider cultural identity, cultural orientation, and the concept of, of acculturation. Uh, we're in need to more and better instruments adapted for Latinos. Part of the, uh, last conference also addressed the need of, uh, sensible adapted adequately translated instruments for Black people. That's also the case for Latinos because as the slide is written, 48% of Latinos indicated "not speaking English well." And in spite of the fact that we may be living here for two, three, four, five years. Something very common in our Latino families is that they adhere to their, uh, traditional language, to their traditional identities, and they continue speaking Spanish, but they go out and they have to deal with, uh, English, just as I'm doing right now. So, uh, 40% of Latinos also have, uh, were born outside the United States. That's almost half of the population of Latinos, which also results in having problems with the language. Although Spanish-language translations of many psychological tests are being sold by major test publishing companies, many of these tests have little or no research supporting their use with Spanish speaking, uh, residents, U.S. residents. So this is something that we have to consider. And then in 2003 the APA published guidelines on multicultural education, training, research, practice, and organizational change for psychologists. This was the first, APA's first formal statement regarding this influence of the cultural factors in those fields, but as we have been speaking about, there is still scant evidence of the utilization of those guidelines. We have them in the DSM-IV, we have them right now with the DSM-5 in the third chapter. We are really, uh, very optimistic, and we hope that, uh, these, cultural formulation, for example, can ready and in use for as many clinicians as, as we call. So clinical interview and diagnosis, uh, with racial/ethnic minorities often result in misdiagnosis. And the cultural formulation, I'm not going to say here because Nichole really talked, uh, about that, covers all these factors and we have also to consider them, especially when we are dealing with Latinos. And knowing about Latinos and knowing that they share different also, um, backgrounds in terms of their country of origin, this is more challenging also to do cultural formulation with us. Among the factors that affect Latino assessment are sociolinguistic factors in the patient-provider communication. And since our counseling interviews and our counseling practice depends so much on the communication between the clinician and the, and the client, uh, these factors need to be considered and taken some action about them. Misunderstandings can arise from differences in language and communication styles, of illness narratives, assumptions about patient and provider roles, health beliefs, and limited resources to negotiate understanding. For example, we all know and research has also established that the use of an interpreter, which is sometimes the only means by which a provider can communicate with a client, introduces, uh, a source of bias, introduces also, effects the dynamic and the rapport that can be established between the client and the counselor. So this is something that's very, very important also. Uh, there are different norms for communicating among cultures such as eye contact, uh, interpersonal distance, and physical touching. For example, Puerto Ricans, we're very physical and we touch and hug and very effusive and passionate, and this can be misinterpreted by a, a clinician that is not so familiar with that characteristic of Puerto Ricans. Spanish speaking clients when interviewed in English were perceived with lower intellectual level and more psychotic symptoms. As I told before, translators, translators also can, could bring misinformation for the assessment and obstruct the rapport. Another factor that can also influence and affect the assessment of the Latinos is the stigma of mental illness. Some research has shown stigma to have a negative impact on patient engagement in therapy and retention. There has bee, uh, data that reveals that, uh, the first interview is very important. It's fundamental to the engagement and the retention. And Latinos, Hispanics and other minorities are also reported to be, uh, uh, to, to leave treatment early, so they are not being retained in their psychotherapeutic process, and this could be a factor that really, uh, hampers that, uh, communication. It is important the identification of communication issues and build rapport rapidly in the first session. However, the stigma may influence how symptoms are experienced and expressed to others. An example of this is that Latinos, for example, express, uh, symptoms in somatic terms. So it will, it will sound like, awkward for a person who is not familiar with, with our culture to hear so much somatic complaints in one first interview. Sorry. Another factor is the perceived mistrust. Nichole also spoke a little about this in her presentation. The mistrust of the healthcare provider has shown to affect the attitudes towards mental health care providers and the treatment. There has been a history of many racial injustices and discrimination, uh, for decades, so this guided, uh, guarded, excuse me, guarded attitude is not completely out of order because, uh, history tells them that this has been happening. So the mistrust is a significant barrier to rapport building and may have also negative effects on the treatment outcome. And this is a factor that we really have to consider. Uh, bilingualism is also a factor that can affect Latino assessment. By definition, ability to speak two languages, but we are struggling with Spanish and English, for example, and, to communicate ourself in, in the mainland country. Uh, patients struggling with language barriers often behave self-effacingly and therapists could infer, "Oh, he is super vigilant," or something, that happening here. In psychiatric or psychological terms, one, it could be mainly that the person is struggling with language and to, and let him or herself explain better. Uh, on the other hand, psychotic processes are ideationally represented more freely in the native language, whereas speaking a less familiar second language makes it like, more difficult for the person to really be open and express his or her symptomatology. So they may look more guarded and less relevatory, not because of a suspiciousness but because of the language, uh, barrier. This is not a conclusive finding, but these are some preliminary results that are alerting us and clinicians to be aware also of these. Another factor is biculturalism, is the presence or coexistence of two different cultures in the same country. It is important to consider the length of time that the person that you are assessing is being here in the States, because of, we may see later there is a different, the years that the person is here and how he is getting, he or she is getting acculturated to this other country, having this mixture of two cultures in the same person. Psychodiagnosis decreases in accuracy as the sociocultural distance between the clinician and the patient increases. So we as the clinicians need to be more sensible and culturally competent. For example, uh, Spanish dominant Latinos tend to express Latino cultural terms of fatalism, familialismo, spiritualism, and patriarchal authoritarianism. And they may be often misinterpreted as pathological by non-Latino clinicians. What has been done, then? There has, research evidence that has highlighted the fact that Latinos and other minorities have obtained lower scores, for example, on cognitive tests or that they deviate significantly on some scales of the MMPI or other personality tests, and we are asking ourselves why is this? One frequently cited reason for this discrepancy is the fact that minority groups have been assessed with instruments that are not adequately translated nor adapted to their culture. And there has been some efforts in these direction. Different researchers have performed translations and cultural adaptations of some of the most frequently used instruments to assess cognition, personality, and psychopathology. Among them are the group of Canino, Bravo, Alegria, Matias, Cortes. And we are proud to have here one of those, that is Glorias Canino, among our audience. For example, Matias and her group have worked, uh, very hard and they have established some translation standards for cross-cultural mental health outcomes, and they use mainly focus groups, uh, bilingual committees, back translation, and a very, very, uh, extensive and thorough process of doing great, uh, adaptations and translations. And they have covered topics like semantic equivalence and content, technical, and criterion equivalence, trying to, uh, make sure that the instruments really, uh, are, that are translated or adapted are really suitable for the Latino populations. There are many instruments that are, uh, developed here in the mainland that are based on this culture, and when you merely translate them, they do not reflect the, uh, the reality of the people from Latin American or Hispanic countries. For example, when we interview, if we ask the person if he has depressive symptoms, are become greater or, uh, are better during the change of seasons and they ask it to me, in Puerto Rico we have a very warm climate during the whole year. If, if I do not look at the calendar and see in which month I am, I really do not know what's different and what season I am, so I am not really in the tune of knowing if my depressive symptoms are getting more deeper in the winter or in the summer. So that question really doesn't make sense, for example, to us. And like that, many other, um, items in some of these outcome and pathological instruments address things that are not familiar to different Hispanic populations, and that's the work that has been doing by, uh, the groups that I just mentioned. And going here, so mostly instruments that they translated and adapted are, are in this slide, uh, the WHO Disability Scale, the Burden Family Assessment Scale, the DISC, the DIS, etc. And here, I do not know if you can see it, but I wanted to, to show an example of the thorough process by which, uh, the, the group in charge of translator, translating and adapting the instruments go throughout this process of translating, uh, back translating, having expert committees to verify if the results criteria really represent those cultures. And then the final end has been more, more reliable instruments for the Latinos. The MMPI also has demonstrated its utility and clinical applicability, but, uh, has, it's lacking norms for the existing Spanish version, version that is widely used in the United States and Puerto Rico. And we should remember that the existing norms for the MMPI-2 include a very small representative number of Spanish speakers, 73 only, from one region of the United States. So, uh, there is, that, that may be some of the reasons that Latinos may often endorse items related to spirituality and to power and influence of spirits and saints in their lives, and those can elevate scores in scales related to schizophrenia and can be considered like they are more, uh, pathologic than they really are. So regarding the psychological assessment, one of the conclusions is that while profile similarity between Latinos and non-Latino whites has been observed in research, it is important to consider that this similarity has been observed when the English version of the instrument was administered to a sample of non-clinical Latinos. So when we have a clinical sample, things will change. Thus it appears that if we are using the U.S. norm with Puerto Ricans, for example, there will be a tendency to overpathologize. Instruments must show adequacy and equivalence of constructs, and if they are not equivalent and if we do not have available, uh, some equivalent instruments, we should emphasize in our reports the limitations that are due of using them to a Spanish speaking or with Latino culture members. Now, regarding with the psychiatric diagnosis, we will share you some of the, uh, some of the questions that we will try to address in this presentation. What do we know about the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses and disorders in Latinos? What contextual variables are related to risk of a psychiatric diagnosis in Latinos? Uh, what contextual variables have been identified as protecting Latinos against a psychiatric diagnosis? And we are going to try to discuss one or two diagnotics, diagnostic entities and their relationships to Latinos. There has been a number of epidemiological studies conducted recently. And we, we've reviewed eight of them. We're going to go a little, for example, in the ECA, uh, the main finding, they, Mexican Americans were divided by Mexican-born versus U.S.-born. And it was found that the first group was, had less depression and anxiety. And, uh, it really is important to consider nativity since we found that, they found that difference between those groups, and it was considered as some possible explanation the "immigrant paradox." Uh, the immigrant paradox, this concept really is that foreign nativity protects against psychiatric disorders despite the stressful events that, the stressful experience of migrating and discrimination and poverty, as I presented in the first slides, despite all those stressful situations, the people that come from those countries to the States, uh, are resulting with less, uh, anxiety and depression. So that was a very significant, uh, factor. This is another, another, uh, study in which a similar, uh, similar, uh, data had been found, that Mexican, uh, that foreign-born Mexicans had lower rates of anxiety disorder and that Latinos had significantly lower rates than non-Latino whites for any substance, mood, and anxiety disorder. However, the exception was the Puerto Ricans that did not do so well, that did not differ from non-Latino whites. And later in the presentation, we will try to, to talk a little more about this. In general, Latinos that were born in the United, uh, outside the United States tend, in these epidemiological studies, tend to have lower rates of depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, and they, evidence, uh, there's lower risk than non-Latino whites. Here we have a chart on any lifetime diagnosis. And we can see that, uh, Puerto Ricans have the highest proportion of the lifetime diagnoses than Mexicans, Cubans, and then other Latinos. That's the way that the profile that they are being shown in this epidemiological study. And regarding any anxiety, uh, diagnosis, Puerto Ricans also stand out there, and then Mexicans, Cubans, and other Latinos. And regarding any substance, we see a difference with, in which Cubans, uh, have less, uh, proportion than the other groups, the Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and other Latinos. In summary, comparing Latinos with non-Latino whites, the Latinos reported significant lower rates for most diagnoses, and there was evidence for the immigrant paradox. U.S.-born Latinos are more at risk for all lifetime disorders than immigrant Latinos. Uh, the National Latino and Asian American Study, the immigrant paradox applies better for some Latinos groups. In this, uh, in this study they concluded that Mexicans really apply this paradox, but for Puerto Ricans do not apply. So there has to be, to take into consideration other factors such as the acculturation hypothesis.

00:28:20
MARGARITA FRANCIA Findings from this, those, from one of those studies indicates that the longer that the Latino immigrants remain in their country of origin, the less cumulative risk of onset of psychiatric disorders that they experience, resulting in lower lifetime rates of the disorders. For example, Mexican immigrants in the United States that had been living for 13 years or more had higher rates of mental health disorder, of any mood disorder, of alcohol abuse, and of drug, drug abuse than the Mexican immigrants in the States that had fewer than 13 years living in the country. Findings from the National Latino and Asian American Study concluded or indicated that foreign nativity is a protective factor for some Latino groups. Example, uh, Mexicans, but not so much for others like Puerto Ricans, implying that other factors besides nativity play a part in the U.S. Latinos' risk of psychiatric disorders. Uh, recently, uh, also we've reviewed, uh, uh, a study, The Prevalence of Mental Illness in Immigrant and Non-Immigrant U.S. Latino Groups by Alegria in 2009. And they also, uh, they also spoke of the immigrant paradox and they said that it consistently held for the Mexican subjects and across mood, anxiety, and substance disorders, while it was only evident among Cuban and other Latino subjects for substance disorders. So in general, in another study regarding, uh, this was a study that was done with three groups: children in the general population in Mexico that were living still in Mexico, children of Mexican-born immigrants, and Mexican American children of U.S.-born parents. And see what they found. In terms of ratios, this big group is the children, of Mexican American children born, of U.S.-born parents. They had 7.4 more probabilities of developing a mental health disorder. So later, then came the group of the children of Mexican-born immigrants, and the Mexican children that still lived in Mexico had lower prevalence. So it, it's sustaining the fact that there's something in those cultures that are protecting them form developing mental health disorders. This is, um, part of my presentation. I am going to leave you with Vivianna. 

00:31:25
VIVIANNA PADILLA MARTINEZ Good morning. Okay, Margarita talked about the facts about Latin American people in the U.S. Now I'm going to try to answer some questions with literature review in like, five, ten minutes, so I'm gonna be a little quick here. Um, the three basic questions are why most Latinos inform lower levels of psychiatric diagnosis? The second question is what may help to explain the immigrant paradox that Margarita was talking about? And the third and most important for us, actually, is why Puerto Ricans usually present more psychiatric diagnoses than other Latin Americans? Well, why most Latinos inform lower levels? We found out that Latinos have a lot of cultural values. Most of them are familism. The familism is the family support, the connection that you have with your family, and that's why maybe the first generation of immigrants that were, the nativity is from their countries of origin, they maintain that connectivity. This is a strong belief that your parents, maybe your grandparents, your siblings are really important for making decisions, to supporting you with your work, maybe financial. And with, we're, um, support in stressful situations. Familism places parents and other family in a very important spot in your life. Family support is the form of monitoring, so maybe the risk of substance abuse, violence, and risky sexual behavior is less because you have the parents monitoring more than maybe other generations and maybe other ethnic groups. The family values, like I said, is very important, but the connection from the first generation to the second generation, it's kind of different. Maybe if I move to the States, I will be really connected with my family values, but maybe my babies, when they got older, they wouldn't, they wouldn't have that connection, but they, they didn't live in the island. So it's kind of different, and that kind of activity is lower, so the protective factors decrease. So we look forward to extrafamiliar social support, like friends and other positive impacts in our lives. The family support helps us to get better health, maybe go have help, counseling in their family. So that connection is very important for us. Other protective factor is the religion. Latinos are highly religious, the highest religion minority group in the U.S. they are more religious than Americans. So this support system is really important 'cuz if you have a problem, you pray and you feel better. So this is a really important protective factor for us. And who are the profile that visits church? Well, they found out that low-income Latino groups go more to church and they look forward to that connection with others in the church, and it's a support group. And another, again, is connection between peers and family. Um, religion, also going to church in the States makes you to have a group, a support group and it facilitates the integration to this culture. Other important factors to consider to assessment and diagnosis, and I think this, this is the part we should talk about the psychotic symptoms, is the belief of spiritism, mediumship, santeria, which is the worship of saints, and spirit possession. Um, thank you. Like Nichole said, Blacks are, and Latinos are misdiagnosed about psychosis, schizophrenia, and maybe it's because of African roots. The belief of spiritism and other things that you answer the question of region when thinking it's, it's normal for us, but maybe in the U.S. norms is pathological. What may help to explain the immigrant paradox? Well, some data reflects that U.S.-born Latinos have a weaker affiliation with traditional Latino values. So if the Latino values are the protective factors for second generation, third generation, it's weaker. So if it's weaker, the pathologies, the problems, the support will be difficult. Another hypothesis is that Latinos that were born here have higher expectations to be accepted because they have the citizenship. That's not maybe completely true. However, over time, these expectations may remain unfulfilled, and that's sad because they came to the States with good expectancies, and they maybe feel pathologized or misdiagnosed or they don't receive the treatment they, they want or they expect, and that's not exactly what we want as therapists or researchers. Also, another thing that happens is family conflict. If you come to the States, the first generation, as I said, is connected to the family. But then, this kids that were here change their culture. They adapt to the American culture, and they started to do things that maybe they didn't in the country of origin that they were, used to be. So you start the conflicts, family conflicts, and the exposure to discrimination. Maybe they have more peer pressure and all of, of this stuff. "We found that higher levels of discrimination and family conflict about U.S.-born Latinos than among immigrant Latinos play a significant role in increasing risk of psychiatric disorder." That's a quote that I really like from Alegria's paper. She has done a lot of research in this area. And they talk about family erosion. It's the erosion of the bonding, that, that connection breaks. Then negotiating an identity. The Latinos here try to negotiate an identity, try to stay connected to their identity of origin, but it's kind of hard 'cuz they want to be acculturated and they want to be living here with the culture here and the characteristics. So we, at the end, we're bicultural, and that's, has problems too. This is a multidimensional process. We don't have perfect things that we know that affects or protective. This is really multifactorial. But it's really interesting to continue doing research with Latinos. And doing this workshop here, um, made me realize that Latinos are different, depending on ethnicity, the country of origin, where they were born. So saying "Latinos" in a general form is kind of weird, 'cuz we're really different within our same groups, so. Conclusions. With the possible exception of Puerto Ricans, the Latino immigrants had lower psychiatric diagnoses with U.S., U.S.-born Latinos. And there's evidence that the immigrant paradox is not the same for every, all the countries. Other conclusions are that the number of years living in the U.S. increased lifetime illicit drug use, and in general, Latinos report less overall psychiatric diagnoses than non-Latino whites with the, with the exception of Puerto Ricans. So why Puerto Ricans usually present more psychiatric diagnoses than other Latinos? We were looking for answers, but I have to be really quick, 'cuz I just noticed that we have ten minutes or less. Um, the studies suggest that youths living in Puerto Rico had lower rates of conduct disorder comparing to the U.S. It was documented that in the longitudinal trajectories, children show decreased rates for those disorders in San Juan but not in the Bronx that was the comparison. It was that, um, children in the Bronx were exposed to higher violence, higher peer pressure, and they were second generation, for sure, so the connection were less. Also, it's documented for antisocial behavior that the experience of being in another culture is really distressing, so it's like an increase of the symptoms. Um, Puerto Ricans, as you may know, we have the U.S. citizenship, so it has found that maybe coping with the immigration, it's different to other Latinos that doesn't have the citizenship from birth. Um, there's like an expectation that we will not be treated as different, but actually in most places we are. And it's an expectation that they will obtain much of the social benefits like Social Security and there won't be consequences. It's like an expectation that we are going to be looked the same, but actually it doesn't. Canino an Alegria found that Puerto Ricans seem to be at greater risk for most disorders than any other Latino ethnic group, and the mechanisms involved for explaining this higher risk are unknown. So we have a lot more to do in this area. I was thinking about talking about PTSD, but I'm going to be really quick on this because I want to talk about ataque de nervios and that's the last part. Well, PTSD is the higher, is higher among Latinos, and why I'm going to talk about PTSD because PTSD is trauma, but in Latinos, when we have trauma, we use item of distress, we use ataque de nervios as a part to communicate with our family about the trauma. So I'm going to be talking about, globally, about PTSD. Three studies have examined between group differences across Latino subgroups in PTSD onset. All reported that Puerto Ricans and Dominicans had more elevated rates of PTSD than other Latinos, even Mexicans. There is a social disadvantage of education, poverty index, and work problems that maybe are influencing these rates. Latinos as a group present disparities in access to the services. They receive fewer and inferior health services than, than their non-Latino white peers. The peritraumatic stress are the reactions that occur during or immediately after the trauma. In all six studies of peritraumatic symptoms and responses were significantly correlated to PTSD in Latino ethnicity, according, and the variance was 21%. Why is this? Fatalism. It characterizes that when something happens to you, there's an external locus of control. You don't have control of yourself or what is happening to you. So this fatalism will, will increase the PTSD rates because you feel that you don't have control. The control value is you are passive instead of active with what is happening to you. So this is why I'm talking about PTSD, because this locus of control could lead to ataque de nervios, or nervous attack, or. The ataque de nervios is an idiom of distress principally reported among Latinos in the Caribbean. What is this? Shouting, attacking of crying, heat, trembling. It could happen with there's a crisis or a trauma. That's why I talked before of PTSD. The ataque de nervios can be, can be experienced dissociative experiences, can be related to family crisis. And the role of ataque de nervios is recognized like a form of cultural communication with your family. So if you are at a funeral and you experience an ataque de nervios, it's kind of normal and as a family, you know that that experience, that person is experiencing a lot stress at that moment. Okay. And you feel powerless. The investigations located the psychosocial etiology of ataques is experienced when people are suffering. So a social world out of control is exactly what they're experiencing. The profile of persons that experience this are usually female gender, lower formal education, and disrupted marital status, among others. Guarnaccia and Canino studied in 1987 this in an epidemiology study, and they, they identified that 13.8% of persons in Puerto Rico experience ataque de nervios, and it's really high. I already talked about the profiles; I'm going to skip this one. Lewis-Fernandez in a patient data in New England here in the States found out that 55.1% among immigrant Puerto Ricans had an ataque de nervios. It's a marker of distress. This is like a small chart to show that women, lack of support, um, increases ataque de nervios. And the conclusion, general conclusions are, number one, the assessment and diagnosis of Latinos needs to integrate their cultural views as collectivistic, their region, their family engagement, support, the family support, their idioms of distress, intensification of distress, and all these emotional characteristics during crisis. Discrimination, language difficulties, etc. The evidence indicates that Latinos are not as homogeneous that they tend to believe, and Puerto Ricans seems to be the higher risk of psychiatric diagnosis. Number three, at the moment of making a diagnosis, the clinician should take into account acculturation, accutrative stress, and this can be used as CFI of the DSM-5. And you have to ask about family values, among other stuff. And this is it. This is Dr. Alfonso Martinez-Taboas. He couldn't be here, but he wanted to show you this picture of his family and his wife, Margarita Francia. And this is it. Thank you very much.
