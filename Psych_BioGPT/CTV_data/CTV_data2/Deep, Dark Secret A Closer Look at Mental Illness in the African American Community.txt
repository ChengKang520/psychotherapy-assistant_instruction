Deep, Dark, Secret: A Closer Look at Mental Illness in the African American Community 

00:00:05
THOM PANCELLA Welcome to this MIMHTraining.com presentation called Deep, Dark, Secret: A Closer Look at Mental Illness in the African American Community. My name is Thom Pancella and I'm with the Missouri Institute of Mental Health in St. Louis. I'd like to welcome you and I'd like to thank you for taking the time to be with us today. I would like now to introduce the newest member of our team, her name is Andrea Purnell, and she will take the program from here and introduce our guests and ta-- and ask-- and be our host and interviewer for today's presentation. So Andrea, the floor is now yours. 

00:00:40
ANDREA PURNELL Thank you, Thom. Hello and welcome. My name is Andrea Purnell and I am the Communication and Artistic Director here at the Missouri Institute of Mental Health. In honor of Minority Mental Illness Awareness Month, we are presenting today's web conference, Deep, Dark, Secret: A Closer Look at Mental Illness in the African American Community. We know that mental illness is frequently stigmatized and misunderstood particularly in the African American community, and today, we have two experts here to shed a light on this subject. I have next to me Dr. Vetta Sanders-Thompson, currently on faculty at Washington University in St. Louis-Missouri Brown School. She's also a licensed clinical psychologist and health service provider here in Missouri. Dr. Thompson res-- her research has covered a broad range of the issues addressing health and mental health. We also have Jermine D. Alberty. Jermine works here as well at the Missouri Institute of Mental Health as the Mental Health First Aid Training Director in the Child and Family Mental Health Service division. Jermine received his undergraduate degree at the University of Phoenix, and is currently working towards his Masters of Divinity at Central Baptist Theological Seminary. Okay. Now this is a very exciting topic and we really want to jump right in. Although, you see us with papers in front of us, we're going to get off script probably sometimes and we're welcoming you, as Thom stated, to offer your questions and your comments throughout the course of this program. This is very important so we're going to really pull back some curtains and tackle a topic that is not often spoke about enough. I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Thompson, and talk about, if you will please, some of the major mental health issues that are facing the African American community. 

00:02:20
Vetta Sanders Thompson, PhD 

00:02:20
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON I think it's important, ah, for everyone to understand that the mental health issues facing the African American community are very similar to those that exist in any other community. When you look at the, uhm, descriptive epidemiology, the, uhm, efforts to understand just how, uhm, prevalent, ah, mental illness is in every community, we found out that the African Americans have about equivalent rates of mental disorders, ah, but often report higher levels of psychological distress. 

00:02:55
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:02:55
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON So one of the things I wanna talk about is the fact that with that psychological distress, it's important to realize that, uhm, poverty, uhm, place, or role in the distress that people will report, and what we know is that, uhm, in the African American community poverty rates are higher. In the recent economic down term we've seen it increase in poverty rates. 

00:03:20
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:03:20
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uhm, we know that for those living below the poverty line, there probably three times as likely to report psychological distress as individuals who are living well above the poverty line. So that becomes important to understand. When it comes to mental disorders, we know that African American-- uhm, African Americans have, uhm, rates of schizophrenic disorders that are about equivalent to the general population. You know, if you look at state, uhm, and public mental health systems, you might believe that African Americans had higher rates. That turns out not to be true. What happens is that because of insurance, because of the way mental health is-- uhm, treatment is paid for in Missouri, about around the country, very often, people are accessing the state and that public system and so you are likely to see higher numbers of people who are African American but low income, other ethnic minority groups, because this is the only viable way to receive treatment. So, uhm, you can't just look in the systems and, and think you understand the epidemiology. So the schizophrenic rates are about the same. Mania, bipolar disorder, about the same, panic disorder about the same. Actually, you tend to see lower rates of depression. I, I always caution people that even though you see lower rates, sometimes people will say, you know, "African Americans don't get depressed." That's not true. 

00:04:45
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:04:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Lower rates does not mean that people don't get depressed. 

00:04:50
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:04:50
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON We see depression in the African American community, similar people will say, African Americans don't commit suicide. We see suicide in the African American community, the rates of suicide among young African Americans has been going up. It is particularly, uhm, important to look at suicide among African American males, they have about twice the completion rate of African American females. And when I say that, they're more likely to-- uhm, actually the-- at following as a suicide attempt. African American females are more likely to attempt, African American males are more likely to complete a suicide if that behavior occurs. Uhm, when you see lower rates of, ah, what wa-- what anxi-- an anxiety disorder, we would call obsessive compulsive disorder, we see lower rates of anti-social personality disorder and anorexia, but that does not mean that African Americans do not have eating disorders because we, uhm, know that we see bulimia and we see overeating, uhm, and both of those are eating disorders. We see, uhm, more, uhm, somatic disorders. And what I mean by that is, uhm, instances where individuals, uhm, report a number of physical symptoms that are a part of that expression, of that psychological distress. Uhm, we see higher rates of phobias, and phobias are specific fears that are, are proportion to the actual danger or threat that's in the environment. We see that, that may have something to do with the, with the environments that we found ourselves living in. 

00:06:35
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:06:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON We also see higher rates of PTSD. Uhm, particularly in low-income communities, uhm, where people are more exposed to violence and, uhm, crime, uhm, we also know that, uhm, you can find higher rates of PTSD among African American veterans. So it becomes important to recognize that, uhm, those are no-- PTSD and phobias are not among, ah, what we would call our serious mental illnesses - 

00:07:05
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:07:10
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON -which would be schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, but, uhm, these are still very serious conditions and warrant concern and, and treatment. 

00:07:20
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:07:20
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON We know, uhm, African American rates of drug and alcohol abuse independence, and this is going to shock some people, are actually typically lower, but there's a caution there, because when people are diagnosed with a mental illness you will often see higher rates of substance to use in abuse than you see in the general population. So when we talk about the fact that drug and alcohol abuse independence rates are lower, we're really talking about the non-diagno-- the, the non-diagnosed population. 

00:07:55
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:07:55
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON We're not talking about those with mental illness. Because when you look specifically within that population, it changes. Uhm, or I've already mentioned suicide, uhm, I think it's important that we pay attention to that, that, ah, issue of psychological distress. Uhm, because what we find is that despite the fact that we, uhm, have people reporting these high levels of psychological distress, we do not see people, uhm, utilizing services at the rates, uhm, that you see in other, uhm, communities, uhm, across the country. 

00:08:35
ANDREA PURNELL And let's talk about that specifically because, uhm, I think that cultural biases amongst mental health professionals as well as health professionals as a whole has a lot to do with the comfort level, the cultural competence of the actual medical health professional. Can, can you speak to that and what it would mean for, uhm, a person of color or, or, or otherwise to find comfort in, in their medical health professional? 

00:09:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON You know, what's important to understand is that, uhm, some of this is the result of the way African Americans typically go about seeking, uhm, services for mental health issues. Typically a person is going to go to their health provider. Unfortunately, we do not have health providers who are well-trained in mental health. And so if a person is reporting physical symptoms and a number of, uhm, people who have psychological distress are gonna say, my stomach is my headache, I've got pains in my arms, my leg, doctors are often focused on finding the physical cause and they're not picking up on, you know, the fact that this may be their way of expressing that distress. The patient is not knowledgeable enough to say, "Hey, it's really that I'm distressed, there's so much going on in my life, I'm maybe a little depressed, I'm maybe a bit anxious," - 

00:10:00
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:10:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - and the physician, uhm, doesn't automatically include mental health screening in their attempt to understand, uhm, that symptomology. So there is that communication issue. You really have to understand how African Americans express distress in order to know maybe I should look at this. So a piece of it is cultural. If you go back to, uhm, traditional Southern culture, anxiety was often, uhm, expressed in what came to be known as falling out. 

00:10:35
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:10:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON So people would just-- if they were under a strain or an-- anxious, it was like a faint, you know. 

00:10:40
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:10:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uhm, so it's another physical manifestation, they weren't-- it's, it's-- they're not necessarily unconscious because very often they could tell you what was going on around them. 

00:10:55
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:10:55
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON But they were not capable of remaining, uhm, sort of upright and, and functioning normally. Uhm, that was an accepted way to handle stress. 

00:11:05
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:11:05
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON You see it much less now, but you still see it in some African, uhm, descendant communities, uhm, you see it more among Haitians in Florida or people in the Caribbean. 

00:11:20
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:11:20
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON But it has always been much more of that physical manifestation, so it becomes a very confusing process. The other issues have to do with the relationships that people have with health professionals. And you've got to remember, if you've got a low-income population, uninsured, it's going to-- it's, it's unlikely that many of them will not have what we call now a healthcare home. They don't have a cost and provider who might know them, might have a relationship with them, might know a little bit about their family, and what's going on the stresses in their lives. 

00:11:50
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:11:50
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Who might then be called in that this is a change and this is unusual and we need to maybe refer you to a mental health specialist. So not having a health care provider that you can turn to means that, you know, you'll be going through this and you will not necessarily be directed to the services that you need. Within your family and your church and your community, many people report to me, they don't-- they know that there is depression, they've heard of schizophrenia, they've heard of bipolar disorder, they're not certain of the symptoms. 

00:12:25
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:12:25
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON They have a hard time figuring out when is it okay that they're responding this way, when has it gone too far, when shall we seek some professional help. 

00:12:35
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:12:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON So there is that issue, and then what type of professional help. And what's the orientation and training? How do those professionals feel about African Americans? And that's where the trust issue comes in. What people have said to me is, it shouldn't matter the person's race or ethnicity, but, and it's a huge but, but it may because being African American has traditionally been stigmatized in the United States. Most professionals-- mental health professionals included are not of African descent and are not ethnic minorities, most did not come from low-income backgrounds, will they understand me? 

00:13:20
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:13:20
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Will they accept me? Or will they judge me? And that but is-- my assumption is they will likely to judge me, particularly if I am distressed, particularly if I've got a lot of issues, uhm, including financial issues, particularly if there's chaos in my family, I'm having problems with my children, my spouse, uhm, particularly if I've-- be-- because of what's going on me, I've developed some legal issues. 

00:13:50
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:13:50
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON That fear of discrimination and further stigmatization is probably a major factor and willingness to engage in mental health treatment. The other pieces that people often don't understand psychotherapy and what it's supposed to do, they don't understand the medications, the categories of the medications, how they work, they don't understand the time frame usually required even for medications to be-- to work and show, uhm, some, uhm, relief of symptoms. 

00:14:20
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:14:20
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And it is where that providers, uhm, take their time to explain all of this in a way that people can understand. You also have to remember that we maybe dealing with low health liter-- population's low literacy populations. 

00:14:35
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:14:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON People getting your pamphlet and say, "Read this." 

00:14:40
ANDREA PURNELL And if you can't read - 

00:14:40
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And if you can't read... 

00:14:40
ANDREA PURNELL - it becomes no good to you. 

00:14:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Exactly. 

00:14:45
ANDREA PURNELL Yeah. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Wow, this is amazing. I appreciate you, you shedding all of the light especially as it relates to the specific issues within the community, some of the effects on the physical health, the cultural biases, all those things are very important. I wanna turn the table just a minute as we, we talk about, ah, the very respected institution particularly in the African American community being the church and why the taboo subject as, as we're describing it to be-- ah, particularly, can you speak from the standpoint of the clergy and why the subject still remains today such, such a taboo subject of, of mental health in the African American community? 

00:15:20
Jermine Alberty 

00:15:20
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Well, I think, really what's missing is a lack of mental health literacy. People just don't understand. And what we don't understand we often demonize or we don't talk about it. And so I think that's one of the reasons why, ah, mental health issues are not addressed from pulpit and I think we have to address from the pulpit and it has to permeate from there to views of the church we sit in. Ah, what Dr. Thompson was talking, the importance of mental health first aid just begin to ring more and more and more. And mental health first aid is a-- just that, the mental literacy program started in Australia in 2007, brought to the U.S. in 2008, and is designed to teach how to recognize how's the symptoms in mental illness, how to help in the mental crisis. Ah, that to how I would know, lead it to professionals. 

00:16:10
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:16:10
JERMINE D. ALBERTY But what we do teach you is how to recognize aside. So that you can see, and in conversation, how do you hear a person and let's do that on judgmentally. I hear what they're saying without passing judgments and hear the symptoms I've shared with you. And so from a clergy point of view I really think that, uhm, a study from Baylor, shared some light on kind of what's going on in the church. In this study 293 individuals approach their pastors for assistance, ah, with their own-- or family members' mental issues and were towed that either they have lack of faith - 

00:16:45
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:16:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY - either they were dealing with demons or just in assist to dollar. 

00:16:50
ANDREA PURNELL Wow. 

00:16:50
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And research shows that most individual who had come to clergy before they come to a psychologist or any other mental health professional. 

00:16:55
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:16:55
JERMINE D. ALBERTY So people are coming to us for a trust of advice and we're not equipped to deal with them. Now we're just passed on what grandma said and grandpa said, and what he heard in the neighborhood and they said. 

00:17:10
ANDREA PURNELL Okay. Wait, let-- let's talk about some of those things that grandma might have said it. Our shoes just touched in the head. 

00:17:15
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Just touched in the head, yeah. 

00:17:15
ANDREA PURNELL Just touched in the head. Just-- you know, we're just, we're just gonna ignore her, she'll be fine. 

00:17:15
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:17:20
ANDREA PURNELL But it's, it's much more than touched in the head. 

00:17:20
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah. 

00:17:20
ANDREA PURNELL I, I think we're, we're, we're seeing this now. 

00:17:20
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah. 

00:17:20
ANDREA PURNELL So mental health first aid, it sounds like a, a wonderful, uhm, combat to, to this issue especially from the standpoint of the literacy. Talk to me about who can benefit from this mental health first aid program. What type of people would you like to see in that class? 

00:17:35
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Mental health first aid is everybody. And when I say for everybody, I mean, if you care for someone who is your uncle, your auntie, your cousin, you know, your brother, uhm, the neighbor down the street. Mental health first aid is for anybody who says, I want to be there to help somebody in need. It's just like CPR - 

00:17:55
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:17:55
JERMINE D. ALBERTY - and the first aid. Ah, if somebody is in need in a crisis, you want to be able to help that person out, but you need to have the tools. And the faith community, I think the tool we have of all things are bibles. And if we're tossed something that goes contrary to our bibles, we don't want it. 

00:18:15
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:18:15
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And so I encourage people that mental health first aid is not to supplant what you believe, your theology is to be another tool. But you know, or somebody say, that all you use is a hammer, you know. 

00:18:30
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Everything. 

00:18:30
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Everything is a nail. 

00:18:30
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:18:30
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And so if you all have then is your bible, then everything is spiritual. And we have to understand we need other tools to deal with these issues. 

00:18:40
ANDREA PURNELL Can you-- and you talk about what you think clergy can do to increase the awareness of mental illness, you mentioned even saying it from the pulpit. Uhm, and even if you can mention some scriptures that may talk about mental health because you're right, a bible is, is the, the driving force particularly in a Christian community. And if they have that force, if there's something in there that we can, ah, speak to that would speak to this issue, are there, are there any scriptures that you can reference as it relates to this topic? 

00:19:10
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Most definitely, there's a whole host of descriptions we use and, uhm, you know, ah... 

00:19:15
ANDREA PURNELL We wanna charge it out. If you wanna charge. 

00:19:15
JERMINE D. ALBERTY You know, the, the study talked about how, in Baylor 2008, followed up and that most clergy, ah, could accept psy-- psychology disorders as being real mental illnesses, but could not accept depression or anxiety as being, you know, real illnesses to deal with. They, they throw it as more environmental or more spiritual factors, and so for instance we have a scripture to lie, God has not given us the spirit of fear but a power, love, and a sound mind. 

00:19:50
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:19:50
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Well, if you don't do a theological research to understand that that's a part of talking to Timothy as there's a form of encouragement, and that theological person will have to deal with lie, just, just encouraging Timothy. There are also sort of thing about sound mind, is that you don't have mental defects. 

00:20:05
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:20:05
JERMINE D. ALBERTY When it really is talking about more self-discipline than it is talking about someone's mental capacity. 

00:20:10
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:20:10
JERMINE D. ALBERTY If you look at scriptures like he will keep you in perfect piece, if you keep your mind, stay and you don't hammer, flip in for this set, great scripture, it provides comfort. But if I'm having hallucinations, how could my mind be stayed on God? 

00:20:25
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:20:25
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Ah, if I'm having illusional thinking, how could my mind be stayed on God? So I think we have to learn how to take the bible and not use it as a billy club. And I really mean billy club and maybe people say, you shouldn't be depressed, you shouldn't experience it in that scripture. You know, ah, be not anxious for anything. But wait a minute now, you know, so these kind of things I think we take them and we make them absolute and we're not really understanding the context on which people are operating that up. And so I think the whole ill part of the action playing which is listening nonjudgmentally if we could just grab that concept of the listing in our judgment and they really hear people on what they're saying, we can be better clergy and better members of our faith communities. 

00:21:10
ANDREA PURNELL When you mention the action plan, you're describing the steps in the mental health first aid program? 

00:21:10
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah. 

00:21:10
ANDREA PURNELL Okay. 

00:21:15
ANDREA PURNELL There's this fast up action plan and I'll go through it real quick. And, and the first part is how to assess for reason of suicide or harm because with depression, anxiety, psychosis, there is a-- there's a risk fracture, there's suicide. They all have mentioned and listen nonjudgmentally that G has to give reassurance and information and I would call this last two Es, E1, E2, and I buy encouragement, encouraging their proper professional help, and then encouraging self-help and other support strategies. And so just taking that plan and help us a lot in the crisis could be just very effective. 

00:21:50
ANDREA PURNELL Wow, okay, that's wonderful. We're in a just a few minutes going to open up the floor for questions. I can imagine the community is on fire about this topic and you have a lot that you want to say and we're, we're really going to turn it over to what, what can we do. It-- it's taboo, but we-- I don't think we, we could even really pull back the covers on, on why it's taboo and how we can get out of this, let's bring these covers down and, and expose this as it is. So let's, let's open it up now if, if you will to the community. Thom, I'll turn it over to you. 

00:22:15
THOM PANCELLA All right. And we do, we've had ongoing number of questions that have popped in here. In fact, a discussion had started among their participants. 

00:22:20
ANDREA PURNELL Wonderful. 

00:22:20
THOM PANCELLA Uhm, the first question comes in, ah, would be how do we guard against mental illness, for it seems a lot of the external issues had become a factor such as traumatic experiences, death, rape, molestation, financial crisis, etcetera. And I believe a lot of this leads to mental breakdowns and depression which could lead to suicide, homicide, etcetera. 

00:22:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON I think that is an excellent question. 

00:22:45
ANDREA PURNELL Yes, I think too. 

00:22:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And it takes us back to mental health. And I was trying to be very careful to talk about in fact that we were focused on mental disorders and mental illness. Mental health can be promoted and in fact I think the next step in mental health has in, in our whole mental health system in the U.S. has to be focused on building resilience and, and take in a more prevention approach rather than focusing strictly on a tre-- on treatment. The traditional things we do to promote health will assist us in prevention, uhm, and promoting mental health. So, a healthy diet. Uhm, using-- and, and, and eating fruits and vegetables for over array of colors. Ah, we always say, eat the colors of the rainbow, uhm, eating lean meats, uhm, mul-- whole grains. But physical activity, we need to get up and move. And for the African American community, this becomes very important - 

00:23:45
ANDREA PURNELL Talk about it. Yes. 

00:23:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - because if you look at the data, which community is least likely to meet the requirements for physical activity? And it's African Americans. And physical activity has a strong impact on mood. We know that brain chemistry is aided by that physical activity. And I'm not saying everyone has to go to a gym, have a gym membership, we're out the cue close. 

00:24:10
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:24:10
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON You know, sweat out your hair whatever your issue is. Walking on moderate pace 30 minutes a day would be sufficient. You know, then it could not be everyday, it could be four or five days a week, but we've got to get moving, whatever you used to do that kept you active, that's what we have to go back to. Even if you dance, you know, remember how you used to do on television, you dance, you do that, you know, if you all skate, I tell skaters, go skate. 

00:24:35
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:24:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON You know, if you earn the bikes, go bike. It will help improve your meal. It's gonna do things for your cardiovascular health, it's gonna improve your physical health, it reduces your risk against but it's going to improve your mental health. Sleep, we're a society - 

00:24:50
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:24:50
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - that has forgotten that sleep is important. We all need to sleep. Even young people need to sleep. Teens need to sleep more. We need to sleep. We think four to five-- we brag about getting four to five hours of sleep. It's not healthy, it's not good for your mental health. You're not alert, you're not engaging in the best problem solving, you can't deal with the stresses of life if you're not alert enough to do good problem solving. And we've got to do better there, we need to connect to others, we need friendships, we need relationships, and I like social media for some things. But you can't determine the number of friends who have by the number of people who friend you on Facebook. Everyone on Facebook is not your friend. And can you talk to these people in times of stress? 

00:25:35
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:25:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And if the answer is no, that doesn't count. 

00:25:40
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:25:40
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON So we've got a really, get off the social media and get back out to reconnect people half close others who can listen to us nonjudgmentally. 

00:25:50
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:25:50
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON While the church needs to understand mental illness from a mental health perspective, we know that spirituality, faith, values are important to your sense of well-being. 

00:26:00
ANDREA PURNELL Yes. 

00:26:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON So we really have to move to develop that sense of, uhm, our spiritual self and promote that. Uhm, people need to understand that if you are ha-- encountering problems you need to seek assistance, there is no shame in seeking assistance. We also need to understand that we can manage stress and we need to manage our stressors. There are times when we need to avoid those situations that we know are excessively stressful and that may include some relationships that - 

00:26:35
ANDREA PURNELL Yes. 

00:26:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - need to be modified or ended, that can mean reducing, uhm, our life spouse, as to that we don't have as many economic stressors, not feeling what we've got to spend on everyone in our lives at holiday time. All of those things become important. And there are other things I could mention, but those are some essentials, and yes, we can do this, it's about building resilience in our kids early. Ah, we can do better than we're doing. 

00:27:00
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:27:00
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And I think it's just recognizing risk factors. You know, if you know that genetics are risk factors and you know your environmental risk factors, knowing those things could be very helpful. You know, so-- so-- sometimes we see that sign on our church that say, do not enter, and we enter anyhow. 

00:27:15
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm 

00:27:15
JERMINE D. ALBERTY You know, we see the one way sign and we just do it anyhow recognizing signs, recognizing symptoms, recognizing risk factors, it's very helpful. 

00:27:25
ANDREA PURNELL Okay. Wonderful, wonderful. Thank you. Next question, Thom. 

00:27:30
THOM PANCELLA And that's what you really mean. Ah, Dr. Sanders, are you familiar with Dr. Cress Welsing's theories and how that might be-- those may be applied to what's being said today? 

00:27:40
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON I am. Ah, I understand and I accept that some issues in, in the African American community are related to the historical, uhm, traumas and injuries that we have experienced. But here's one thing I want to emphasize to the people, the most important traumas in our lives are those that we are experiencing in the here and now and learning to identify and manage those be, uhm, resilient to those is-- are-- it has to be our primary focus at this time. As a community, we have a lot of work to do to understand how we support each other - 

00:28:30
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:28:30
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - uhm, as we face discrimination today. As a country, uhm, as a whole, we still have a great deal of work to do to understand and address, uhm, the way that, uhm, slavery, Jim Crow, and, uhm, legal-- and, and formal as well as informal segregation has affected, uhm, African Americans psychologically. I think there are links there, do-- I think that is the major issue in our community now. So Frances Cress Welsing, Welsing talked about, uhm, the, uhm, psychic trauma that resulted from slavery and discrimination and how it affects the mental health of African Americans. Well, I think there is some, uhm, legitimacy to enter generation of transmission of trauma because people began to create fears and barriers and obstacles because they have been real for them, they transmit that to their children, and it just goes on a duration. So we all are socialized to be a little bit, ah, more, uhm, hypervigilant, uhm, cautious in certain areas and that ha-- has a way of affecting the way you look at the world and live your life. So those weights of anxiety disorders that I see, I always tell people, that's probably some of that length. However, that only goes so far. So I, I temper that with what's going on in the here and now. 

00:30:05
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. And to speak to that briefly, I've even heard people use the excuse, well, African Americans made it through slavery. We can make it through anything. We don't have mental health issues, if we can get through that, we, we have no problems. But that type of mentality is keeping us in bondage. It really, and we're suffering from it as a whole because we think we can wear the weight of the world on our shoulders. We'll take about the black male, but even the black female. I mean, she is literally wearing the weight of the world and, and you don't have to. There is mental health help that you can receive. 

00:30:35
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And I think we have to just really look at one word and that's transparency. 

00:30:40
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:30:40
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Being transparent with one another about what we've actually dealt with and keeping it real as they say. We keep a lot of secrets in the black community. We don't - 

00:30:50
ANDREA PURNELL Yes, they do. 

00:30:50
JERMINE D. ALBERTY - tell stuff. There are things that happened to our great, great grandma or just our grandma that you'll never know about. And if you were honest about that trauma, that was a experience, then I think we could have some more healthy relationships. But you know, that there are some stuffs that just happened just here now that we have to deal with. 

00:31:05
ANDREA PURNELL Yeah, yeah, that dialogue is extremely important, extremely. Next. 

00:31:10
THOM PANCELLA What do you mean this gonna come as a big surprise, but, ah, you're introducing the church topic, ah, launched a little bit of a, ah, discussion out here. Let me see if I can capture some of the stuff and let you, let you feedback on it. Ah, what mental illnesses are often demonized in the African American church is what is the best way to identify signs of things such as schizophrenia and convince loved ones to seek help because mental illness, mental health has nothing to do necessarily with some of these other issues, and it goes on-- the people go on to say that that seems like the church and sometimes the way to free the mind and be a place where they can find release and another person comments that they agreed with something that you said but also that the-- this the biblical relationships at the bib-- some people see the bible as being only spiritual but not as, as fully human as it is spiritual. And then finally the comment comes in, ah, if the church could embrace our humanity as much as we embrace our spirituality the church could more readily embrace any among us, ourselves included, who deal with mental illnesses. So you've got a lot to chew on that. 

00:32:25
ANDREA PURNELL Yeah. 

00:32:25
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Well, well, I, I think we can begin where you ended, and I think that the church has call to a total person. That the church has not just called to save us all for tomorrow, but to deal with the person of today. So we're called to deal with the emotional, spiritual, and physical well-being of all that we consider to be members of our-- and, and that's not just the church, but that's the synagogue, that's the temple, that's, that's the, the mosque, that's all places where people to go to find relief, because we had this all added-- that, that church as a hospital, but I, I just kinda wonder when people come to the hospital they wouldn't want to be treated. 

00:33:05
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:33:05
JERMINE D. ALBERTY You know, as the-- you know, as the way we should treat people who come to get help. So I, I think that, ah, yes, the bible, ah, can be looked to for comfort where we had to always keep the scripture within the contemporary context. You know, we have to understand that, yes, the struggles of those of the ancient times were those struggles. But we have to say, how do I take this bible and make it applicable to where I am right now. And I think that's really important and so I think that when we look at ancient text, and there's a lot of depression in the bible, I mean, they call it germane, we'd been profit. It wasn't there for no reason. 

00:33:45
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:33:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY He was depressed, and, and so that the vision that they see and I wonder if that anyhow that's another question. But, but, but, but... 

00:33:50
ANDREA PURNELL Yeah, it's another question. My next topic would be, what happens when you go to church and they say, depression is a demon, is a spirit, let us cast that out of you, you know. 

00:34:00
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:00
ANDREA PURNELL You know, and, and it, and it in a sense a mental illness, but you're feeling so, uhm, you know, put into this box of something is wrong with me, this is my problem, how would-- why would you even want to share. If I know-- if I share that, this is what will happen, you go and take me up to the front and put me in the water and-- you know what I'm saying? I cast out this demon. 

00:34:15
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON I think there are two things we've got to keep in mind on this topic, that always defer to the person who is experiencing the, the illness - 

00:34:25
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:30
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - for the decision on how to relate to their faith. For some people, going to the church for prayer and having something cast out, we're-- I know people who use that in conjunction with their medication and their psychotherapy. If I work with someone and that's what they want to do, that is perfectly fine as long as that's what they want to do and they do not feel pressure, they do not feel stigmatized or demonized by their congregation. Other people on the other hand get messages from the congregation and say, come off those midst because this will work better. 

00:35:05
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:35:05
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uhm, don't see that therapist, they're gonna lead you straight to hell. That is a pressure that this person is not able to, uhm, worship and express their faith and, and, and also address their health-- mental health meet. So we have to differentiate between those. If a person is choosing that and they wanna use it as an action, that is fine. And I even acknowledge the right of the individuals to decide if they would rather go to those fo-- faith-based treatments rather than our sort of medicalized treatments, that's an individual choice - 

00:35:45
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:35:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - it's not the one that I am most comfortable with or would advise, but it is a, a choice that people can and do make. But it is that individual's choice and we have to be there if they change their mind on our side but their total respect and be there if they change their mind and we wanna use what we have to offer. We all have to work together, we have to understand, you know, how these decisions get made and be prepared to be there, uhm, however it falls out for that individual. 

00:36:20
ANDREA PURNELL Wonderful. The more choices, the better, I think. 

00:36:20
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah. 

00:36:20
ANDREA PURNELL Definitely. Okay. Let's-- can we go to an-- another question, if there is one? 

00:36:25
THOM PANCELLA Sure. This is an interesting one, do you believe that since the majority of African American males are in the prison system this causes a lot of the mental illness in the community. 

00:36:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Hmm, first of all, I have to say that from a statistical standpoint I don't think the majority of African American males are in prison. 

00:36:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY No, no. No. 

00:36:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uhm, we say that, and we say a little too loosely we have a higher rate of incarceration in the African American community, but luckily most African American men had made outside of prisons and jails. So, uhm, having said that, we know that a higher proportion of people in, uhm, prison and jails do have, uhm, mental health problems, have psychiatric diagnosis that have gone undiagnosed, and, uhm, even if diagnosed often untreated. And that's a serious problem, we really have to examine ourselves and our system that we do psychiatric treatment through a criminal justice system. 

00:37:25
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:37:30
ANDREA PURNELL Can you speak to that, Jermine? 

00:37:30
JERMINE D. ALBERTY I was gonna say, I, I think, uhm, just to get back on that is because if we're not receiving treatment that they end up, ah, you know, one of the human's population is a high, ah, privacy mental illness in the human's population and so forth. 

00:37:40
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:37:40
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Ah, and so I think that's not being treated early, that her intervention is so important and so key, you know, and just piggyback back on mental health first aid just teaching folks how to recognize symptoms early in those so it doesn't turn to a serious mental illness. And that could be so key but would regard us to have the men in prison. Yeah, we do, yeah. 

00:38:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON The, the other piece of that is you-- if you look at that prison population many of those people are in there particularly in the African American community, they're in for drug and alcohol related offenses. 

00:38:15
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah, yeah. 

00:38:15
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And we know that a number of people who are using drugs and alcohol have mental health problems, and remember, that I said at the beginning, a large pa-- portion of our mentally ill population uses drugs, uhm, and alcohol. So that's where we really have a problem. So if we could get some treatment in, we might, uhm, actually make some progress in that area. 

00:38:35
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And that trigger this whole concept of medication that we do often in our community with drugs, with alcohol to deal with anxiety, to deal with depression, to deal with pain, and so being-- and so that whole chicken and the egg concept, which came first, you know. 

00:38:50
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:38:50
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And we have to just treat, treat both of them. 

00:38:55
ANDREA PURNELL Definitely. 

00:38:55
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And so often when we talk about mental health we don't wanna talk about drug and alcohol. 

00:39:00
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Uh-hmm. 

00:39:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON We separate the two. 

00:39:00
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Uh-hmm. 

00:39:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And I think that's the other issue we've got to understand, these are different sides of the same point. 

00:39:05
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Uh-hmm. 

00:39:05
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON These are not things that we can sort of, uhm, disaggregate or pull apart. 

00:39:10
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:39:10
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Remember, health includes, you know, our ability to, uhm, prevent the abuse of substances, but also to treat individuals if they fall into substance abuse or dependents. 

00:39:25
ANDREA PURNELL Definitely. Okay. 

00:39:25
THOM PANCELLA All right. How do you get someone to see that there is a problem? How do you help them and introduce them to mental illness and ac-- accept that they are exhibiting some symptoms? 

00:39:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Hmm. You wanna go, and I wanna drop in. 

00:39:40
ANDREA PURNELL Jermine? 

00:39:40
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Well, I mean, I, I think that we have to-- one of the things-- as, as someone is a monster, if you would, a mental health first aid is, telling the person, I'm concerned about you, telling the person that I wanna help you, and the person says, I don't want your help, I'm available when you woke me up. Never closing that door. But I, I think that, you know, the thing begins by just saying I'm concerned about you. And not criticizing, not judging, but I'm concerned about you as an individual. And we talk about person in the first language. Ah, where we don't call the person by their diagnosis, where we call them by their name. So I'm not coming and saying, there, you're alcoholic. I'm not concerned, I'm concerned about the fact that, you know, you seemed to use alcohol as a way to cope with your issues. 

00:40:30
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uh-hmm. 

00:40:30
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And so I think that keeping that person first is so, is so impor-- important. 

00:40:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And I think it's noting changes that you're seeing. Uhm, if you can share with them, you know, how they're different from the past, uhm, sharing how it's affecting you, that relationship, the relationship within the family, among the people who love and care about them, that among the people they love and care about - 

00:41:00
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:41:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Sometimes people are not recognizing, you know, that they've changed and they're not recognizing that people around them are being affected by what's going on at that ti-- and just bringing that to them and putting it out there, it can help them, uhm, take a look. Uhm, co-- letting them know re-- uhm, bringing forward the consequences that are cruel because of what's going on if there is loss of income, loss of job, if you're losing the place where you live, uhm, if family members are now pulling away from-- those are things that if you can lay it out you don't have to judge, just lay it out so people can see it. That can sometimes help people recognize. 

00:41:45
ANDREA PURNELL Great advice from both. 

00:41:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And, and one of the, uhm, and I'm sure you've moved, Dr. Thompson, states of change, you know, people often are in that contemplative state where they're not even thinking about it by, by just bring in to him it could at least bring him to contemplate that there is an issue, there is a problem. And then they may begin to seek to help, but just sometimes people are just not aware of what damage they're doing now to themselves but to the lives of others. 

00:42:10
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. And I think even the fact that you mentioned about opening the door and leaving it open. Ah, I think we're exposing some major points today, some people are hearing this for the very first time, a light bulb is going off, but I think it, it may take some time, you know, for people of color specifically to come to the light of mental health and saying that it is a good thing, but I think the more conversations we have like this, the more-- that this important dialogue, ah, continue to happen, then we'll, we'll see, we'll see a shift 'cause I, I think it's important for the future of, of where we're going to do so quickly. And we got time for a few more questions. Thom, do you have another one? 

00:42:45
THOM PANCELLA I do. 

00:42:45
ANDREA PURNELL Okay. 

00:42:45
THOM PANCELLA And this one kind of spins directly off of the one we were just talking about and, and if-- that this person asks, how we treat someone who believes they do not have an illness but have external problems. 

00:43:00
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON What-- it-- I think that issue goes to how extensive those problems are. Now if a person is schizophrenic, uhm, and hallucinating and delusional, if a person is bipolar and a manic face and, uhm, causing harm to him or herself, there are ways that you can, uhm, work with the mental health system, the mental health providers to get them into, uhm, assessment to determine the, the extent of the impairment and the need for treatment and if necessary involuntarily obtain treatment. But those are for the extreme cases. What we really want to focus on is avoiding those situations because that's never a great action. We want to reach people early. So it becomes important to work with mental health first aid so you recognize signs and symptoms early and enter people in the treatment before they are so incapacitated that they are very unlikely to be aware of their need for assistance. Uhm, I think sometimes that means availing ourselves of assistance with our children early on because many of these disorders are manifesting in adolescence. And if you are observing, you will recognize my town is not acting the way they had their affect as changed, their demeanor has changed, their relationships had changed, their academic performance has changed. Those are the things we typically see changing, uhm, and that usually begins and it progresses over time before you have a four-episode of some of these disorders. So intervening at those earliest, earliest signs that it comes strategic. 

00:45:00
ANDREA PURNELL Are there any other warning signs that you can lay out, ah, Dr. Thomp-- that, that people can, can look to besides academic that a teenager may, uhm, be showing or lashing out that a parent can be aware of? 

00:45:10
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON A person who had friends and engage in normal activities and now they were drawn from their friends, uhm, and they're no longer participating in those activities. A child who, uhm, seems excessively irritable. 

00:45:25
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:45:25
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uhm, is ha-- is lashing out, uhm, aggressive toward peers and family members and others. 

00:45:30
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:45:30
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON That can be a sign. Particularly if it represents a change in their effective and social response. Uhm, difficulty sleeping. If you noticed your teen up early in the morning unable to sleep, up late at night unable to sleep, or just sleeping too much, having difficulty getting out of bed, that can be a sign. But that's a sign even with adults. Changes in appetite, uhm, become, ah, our signs that you might want to pay attention too. We could go, oh, no, no, there are a lot of things where it really means paying attention. I think family members also have to listen to people who spend a lot of time around those children. Teachers sometimes speak up on behavioral changes, now parents tend to pick up a great deal on affective changes, but teachers pick up on behavioral changes and you need to listen. 

00:46:20
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. 

00:46:20
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON You know, we get a little defensive when people say things about our children. 

00:46:25
ANDREA PURNELL Yes, we do. 

00:46:25
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Uhm, but sometimes we need to listen. 

00:46:25
ANDREA PURNELL Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Okay. Wonderful. 

00:46:30
THOM PANCELLA Ah, Jermine, uhm, is-- what is the difference between your model and the clinical pastoral education, the CPE? There's, there's trainings available for all seminarians. How do we encourage present clergy to get this training? 

00:46:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Well, I, I always--ah, really finishing up my Masters of Divinity program, one of the things we encourage, ah, individuals is to stay with being your range of expertise and they know when to refer. And so they are clinical pastoral programs. And if you have the expertise in the background, that's great, but I think even with clergy you have-- you want to refer even if you have that expertise because you get too close. And, and so you have to know when you've done all you can do. I think mental health first aid is for that clergy member who doesn't have that clinical background and just needs to recognize signs and symptoms when a person is in crisis and went to refer. And so I think that those programs can complement one another. Uhm, but, but there's a lot of clergy who provide and they will say, counseling, and I would discourage you from saying your counseling. So one, and you maybe given advice, but if you don't have a clinical license to counsel you shouldn't be counseling folks in certain areas. Uhm, and so it-- that's, that's... 

00:47:50
ANDREA PURNELL And I'm, I'm glad they brought that up because I think it's important what you're trying to create is a relationship. Again, it's not, you know, clergy over here and mental health over here, it really is bridging the gap between these two, two groups to come together to better serve the people. Yeah, it's great. 

00:48:05
THOM PANCELLA And several to kind of fall into the category of barriers and so I'll try and group this together as well. Ah, how much of a difference would it make regarding mental health awareness and treatment mental health in those communities if they had practitioners that look like them? If drugs and alcohol are a factor in mental illness, why do I-- why do we allow our communities to be flooded with drugs and liquor stores? A major problem that occurs in African American families is to ignore the fact that mental illness can be genetic, just as genetic as alcoholism and other illnesses that plague the African American communities. And then do you believe that the lack of financial resources and willingness of psych service units to accept Medicaid is part of the barrier and how do we overcome these barriers? 

00:48:50
ANDREA PURNELL Really, Thom? All four major questions in one? 

00:48:50
THOM PANCELLA You, you, you, you got, you got a couple of minutes. 

00:48:55
ANDREA PURNELL Great questions. Jump right in wherever you'd like. 

00:48:55
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Okay. Uhm, one thing I will say is that if you are-- if you-- the answer to the last question first, there are resources, if you have a serious mental illness, uhm, that-- where you can use that Medicaid coverage. Uhm, in this state we use, uhm, our administrative agent system, but there providers who even in the private room who relates that Medicaid. Uhm, there are information or referral ones in most areas to assist people in finding those providers who will accept Medicaid. I encourage people to make contact with, uhm, the associations in their community, the social workers' association, the psychological association, the psychiatric association, you could contact, uhm, a Mental Health America group or NAMI grouping, or National Alliance of Mentally Ill group in your area for referrals to, uhm, uhm, practitioners who will accept the form of insurance that you have. Uhm, but having said that, it is a significant barrier - 

00:50:10
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Uh-hmm. 

00:50:10
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - and one has to realize that in the system we've created we focus on the treatment of serious mental illness which means that people who have less serious disorders that we wanna prevent from progressing often find it very difficult even with mental health parody loss now to get, uhm, adequate coverage for treatment, uhm, if you are uninsured it becomes a significant barrier. So we have a lot of work to do to achieve full and real parody in mental health treatment. It is hoped that the affordable care act will help alleviate some of that, the problem is that is going to be, do we have a sufficient number of mental health practitioners ready to enter into that public, uhm, health system to treat people who may now have some coverage and are in need of mental health, uhm, services. Are, are we going to train health practitioners well enough that they can work with and manage, uhm, some of the less severe mental health problems that people have. Uhm, these are things, these are questions that have not been answered that is difficult to understand. The o-- the other thing I wanna comment on, and I know everyone else get in there, is that if you look at the literature on ethnic and racial matching it is not clear that ethnic and racial matching results in improved, ah, mental health outcomes or reduction in symptoms. And when I have done my own research, what people have said to me is that they are not necessarily focused on the match, they want someone who shows concern, who seems to understand them in their situation who's willing to listen and to help them problem solve and achieve, uhm, some relief given the, the, the issues and the concerns that they're facing in their life. They're no more convinced that those of those who trained in the broader society have gone through these institutions still have enough sensitivity, uhm, respect and willingness to listen that-- to-- so that we can assist them than people who are not members of the, of the African American community. So I think it is a-- it's problematic if we assume because-- and the African American goes to see an African American all is well. There's not dated to suggest that that's the case. That having said that, do I want to see greater diversity in the mental health profession, the answer is absolutely totally yes, we got to do better. 

00:52:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY And... 

00:52:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON Because that will get people out there - 

00:52:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah. 

00:52:45
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON - who can talk to the community about this issue. 

00:52:50
JERMINE D. ALBERTY I will say, I mean, that's where as a young adult pastor, as a youth pastor, I just wanna jump on that because we need to encourage young people to get into these fields, to, to get into the fields of science, get-- I mean, to really broaden their horizons from just, you know, a typical, you know, career choices and say, we need you in these fields to help others, we, we need social workers, we need mental health professionals. And so if you know a young person and they say, what do you wanna be when you grow up, consider being a psychologist, there's lots of room out there for, for psychologist and psychiatrist and, and our mental health professionals. So you know, I, I would say, encourage, you know, young people to look at those fields. Not a lot of money, sometimes. 

00:53:35
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON We're not in it for the money. 

00:53:35
JERMINE D. ALBERTY We're really in it for the heart. 

00:53:40
ANDREA PURNELL For the calls and never for the applause. 

00:53:40
JERMINE D. ALBERTY For the calls, yes. 

00:53:40
ANDREA PURNELL Can you speak about the socioeconomic question and the liquor stores - 

00:53:45
JERMINE D. ALBERTY Yeah. 

00:53:45
ANDREA PURNELL - particularly in the, in the minority communities? 

00:53:50
JERMINE D. ALBERTY I'm a lot of a faith-based organizing and this becomes in many ways a zoning issue. I mean, if your community set up in a zone for liquor stores and paid a lean and all the other things, then that's a, that's a zoning issue, and so if that's the issue in your community you need to organize around that and say, we want more grocery stores that sell fresh fruits, the rainbows versus the convenient stores rather, you know, I pay follow-ups for a gallon of milk or do that for a loaf of bread. That involves us to take an action in our community say, you know, we want more grocery stores and more other businesses in our community of course with those. So that's not gonna happen just by complaining about it. We have to put our feet to the ground and do something. 

00:54:30
ANDREA PURNELL Okay. 

00:54:30
DR. VETTA SANDERS-THOMPSON And the more professionals we have in the community to help people figure out how to organize to change things, the better off we're gonna be. 

00:54:40
ANDREA PURNELL Okay. Wonderful, wonderful. Well, we're just about out of time, but I would like to open the floor to both of you for one final comment or any shameless plugs that you would like to do for upcoming events. Ah, Jermine, how about we start with you, tell us more about mental health first aid and how we can find out more.
