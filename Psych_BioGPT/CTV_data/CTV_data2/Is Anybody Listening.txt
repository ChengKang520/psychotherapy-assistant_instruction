PAULA J. CAPLAN This story begins with my father. For decades, I could not remember some of his stories and I had no idea why? Good actors make good storytellers and he was a great actor. You’ve never heard of him because at Columbia University in New York during the Depression he was too poor to go to acting school, and then he was drafted into World War II and after that he was working hard making a living to support his wife and two children in Springfield, Missouri. He was gracious loving smart, completely unassuming, funny, deeply but quietly engaged in everything and interested in life, especially listening to others. He could draw out the shyest people because he listened intently, his blue eyes focused completely on you.

Donahue, 1989 

00:00:55
PAULA J. CAPLAN The only listener I ever saw was listening matched his was talk show host Phil Donahue on who show I was a guest. From the back of a big audience, Donahue could look it up on stage and make you feel like no one else was in the room, that’s how my father was. But why was I sometimes a bad listener for him. After my father died, a Vietnam veteran who had known him told me there was no way I would ever know what he had been through. I’m sure he’s right but by listening since his death to many other veterans including Isaac Pope and Charles Johnson who served with him, I have learned too much. And they and others have generously fed my longing to know how life has been for veterans from all eras.

Listening Session 

00:01:40
PAULA J. CAPLAN I have also learned how important it is for non-veterans to listen to them. 

00:01:45
Is Anybody Listening?

Capt Jerome A. Caplan 

00:01:55
969th Field Artillery Batallion 

00:01:55
PAULA J. CAPLAN My father Jerome A Caplan was captain of an all-black artillery battery during World War II. They fought in the Battle of the Bulge, Western, which was a crucial battle of the war against the Nazis. They were the first black unit allowed to go into battle in World War II because their performance was Sterling and they want a presidential citation for meritorious service. After my father died, I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Isaac Pope who had been my father’s first sergeant and he told me how they won the citation. 

00:02:25
Isaac Pope 

00:02:25
1SG, 969th Field Artillery Batallion, WWII, US Army (Ret.) 

00:02:25
Served with Capt Caplan 

00:02:25
ISAAC POPE Captain Caplan, They ordered the 969th Howitzers to go into action. Our "B" Battery was the first one that got into action, got those guns into action and wiped out them tanks where they were headed around. They’d cut everything off, you know, and wiped them out. That’s what caused us to get that citation from the President. 

00:02:50
PAULA J. CAPLAN I was a non-veteran growing up in a home of a veteran. Unlike many veterans, my father spoke about his war experiences but for most of my life I absorbed very little. Like most veterans who speak about their experiences, he never said he did anything important or heroic. Instead he told stories about how wonderful where the men with whom he served. Some of the stories were funny, somewhere interesting, somewhere poignant, but something bothered me. And when I figured out what bothered me, it started me on a journey of listening to veterans and speaking to others about what I’ve learned. Every year when I was growing up, when Christmas was approaching, which was the anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, my father would say 12 years ago tonight or 15 years ago tonight and then described how the weather was freezing, snow was falling heavily. Each year, I hung on his every word but each year when he began to tell the stories again, it would strike me that if you ask me right now to tell you what those stories were, he couldn’t remember any of them. And then when I was about 40, friend made a video tape of my father telling us stories and gave me a copy. I put the tape on, sat alone in my room and sure enough, there he was telling the stories that I recognized and all of a sudden I heard him say that words… 

00:04:15
JEROME A. CAPLAN I was a forward observer and trained as a Forward Observer. 

00:04:15
PAULA J. CAPLAN I was a Forward Observer, and then I had to turn off the tape. Because I broke down and wept. I know what a Forward Observer was, that’s the person who goes out ahead and his closest to the enemy, and that’s when I realized that all those years I couldn’t bear to think of my father in such danger. So I just brought the stories out. All of those years, my father and I were part of what Colonel David Sutherland caused the epidemic of disconnection between veterans and non-veterans.

DAVID W. SUTHERLAND As I see things, the relationship between the American people and the military is a disconnect. 

00:05:05
PAULA J. CAPLAN In this country of 317 million people, only 23 million that’s less than 7% are veterans from any era and only 2.2 million are combat veterans, that makes those veterans who’ve been in combat one 1% of the American population, some people called them "The other 1%". The experience with my father showed me how little I knew that we live in a nation that is war illiterate and even military illiterate. I wanted to learn more and so began my years of listening to veterans. What began with my father has led to years of listening to veterans and telling non-veterans what I’ve learned from listening, things I had not learned from my father.

ALAN PIETRUSZEWSKI Late after flight offset, 2 in the morning, you’ll find yourself somewhere on the ship, that’s private and quiet, and one of the catwalks or at the bow or stern of the ship. And you’re looking up at the stars going, I’m really lonely, and it’s… it’s an oxymoron. Because you’re on a small ship with 4,999 other guys and girls, you feel alone.

DAVE CULMER After the dissolution that occurred and the realization hit that the war was a whole different thing than they had been told or it was indicated to them before they went to Vietnam. Firefights, after firefighters, umm… when the enemy was still in the area, guys would have to go back out to the field when there was no logistical reason that would be beneficial to do this, and was only to get, they were told to go back and get a body count. 

00:07:10
DAVID W. SUTHERLAND Those sacred moments from the battlefield turning into secrets where I can’t share, or I can’t talk about them, or I get asked did you kill somebody? I spent my entire life learning that thou shalt not kill. And then I go into a combat zone and I’m expected to perhaps kill, that moral injury is something that I don’t need to talk about but if I do, it’ll be on my terms.

NEHRU V. HARPER The Naval investigation service was knocking at my door and they wanted to know, you know, did I know of any lesbians onboard my ship, and I told them, "No. I’m not a (inaudible) anybody," you know, and I was asked, "What about you?" And I said, "What about me?" "Are you gay?" I said, "Yes, I’m gay." I’m thinking I have a stellar background in the military. I had a great future, you know, and I was released from active service like two months later honorably discharged but I could re-enlist again. So, you know, thank you for your service. 

00:08:40

00:08:45
PAULA J. CAPLAN From veterans, I learned that going from civilian life to the military is a culture shock and so is coming home. 

00:08:55
DAVE CULMER What happens to the body and the mind when you’re in that kind of environment, is the body and the mind protect each individual person by shutting down the emotions because when you see a guy get hit or a guy get killed where you see body parts fly off. If your emotional self was totally intact, you’d be a basket case in six weeks. You can’t leave an environment like that and go back to the place you left and be the same person.

KATHY PLATONI Veterans and non-veterans have mistaken beliefs about each other. A lot of veterans assume that non-veterans could not possibly understand and that they will judge them to be crazy and a lot of non-veterans believed that all veterans are mentally ill. You hear about it all the time in the media that all veterans are violent and that they joined the military because they wanted to go kill people. Well, in more than 35 years of listening to veterans, I have never met anyone who joined the military for that reason.

MICHELLE DILLOW Well, as far back as I can remember it began when I was a kid in the 80s and seeing that army commercial on TV with the tank coming over the hill, Be All You Can Be, it was so glorious and you know, I remember thinking that I would love to do that. When it came to the time where I was old enough, umm… that I could join, I really wanted to go to college also, and I didn’t really have the money to go to college so I decided to join the National Guard so I could do both at the same time, the both the military and college. When I went to the recruiter, he asked me, what job I wanted and I told him I wanted to be a tanker, mainly based on those commercials that I saw growing up and then when I told him, I wanted to be a tanker, he laughed at me and he’s like, "Well, you can’t be a tanker, you’re a woman." So I asked him, I said, "Well, what’s the next… next best thing?" And he says… he shows me a picture of a bulldozer and that’s how I pick the job. 

00:11:05
ISAAC POPE World War II broke out. And that changed the picture of the whole nation. Everything changed. If you wasn’t under the draft, you couldn’t get no jobs, so that was a handicap. So I was forced to drop out of school and sign up for the Army. Rather than wait for the draft, I just went on and volunteered. 

00:11:30
FRANK GUZMAN And the military offered the GI Bill and other benefits for school and all, as that’s what I needed so… so I went to the near… we went to go see my friends recruiters, sign up and the next thing I know, I’m in the Marine Corps, doing things, I didn’t plan on doing begin with. 

00:11:50
PAULA J. CAPLAN Non-veterans have told me that all veterans are mentally ill and only therapists can help, so there’s nothing anyone else can do. 

00:12:00
DAVID W. SUTHERLAND That war trauma manifests itself in front of our families, our neighbors and our communities and it creates a misunderstanding, a stereotype that’s driven in most cases by media and the unwarranted hysterics that the media creates, expands that sense of isolation, that… that feeling of not feeling like you’re fit in. You feel like you don’t belong and so to defeat that, to… to make that connection, people have to understand compassion and outreach, what we used to call friendship. 

00:12:35
[music] 

00:12:40
PAULA J. CAPLAN I had long suspected that most Americans who are not veterans just don’t want to think about veterans, perhaps because they’re associated with war and who wants to think about war. In blogging for Psychology Today, I’ve sometimes written about veterans and they show you how many people have read each of your essays. When you look at the numbers, it turns out that with one exception every time I write anything about veterans, only 30% to as few as 3% the number of people read them as read anything else I ever write about. They’re in black and white is evidence of that divide. We don’t have to think about it so we won’t. There are many reasons veterans often don’t talk to non-veterans. 

00:13:20
FRANK GUZMAN I can’t force them to make them understand what I’m going through, you know, there are some veterans who are able to talk about and those are just tell you, no, I don’t want to talk to you, you don’t understand squat, you know. 

00:13:30
KATHY PLATONI Some veterans are afraid to talk to non-veterans because they are afraid of being considered crazy or completely misunderstood. Too many of us have been perceived as just angry or insane veterans but what we feel are the deeply human reactions of being so desperately distressed by war or other devastating experiences. Some who have not been told they are mentally ill or afraid that they really are, they think I’m home, I’m safe, why am I not over it by now? I must be crazy. But the fact of the matter is that not a one of us comes home unscathed. 

00:14:15
PAULA J. CAPLAN Sadness is real. Fear is real so our loss of innocence and moral anguish but do we need to call everything a mental illness. If you want to call being devastated by war or sexual assault a mental illness, then what would be a healthy response. 

00:14:35
NEHRU V. HARPER It’s the helplessness that happens when you feel like you’re about to be molested, raped, whatever the case may be and you can’t do anything about it. I was in the builder’s of a ship, where I was the store keeper in the Navy. I was asked about a couple of parts, I went to go check it out in the store room when I came back I guess these… these cats though, they were going to have a party, you know, umm… they wanted to meet me straight. You know, so, umm… you know, it was a little tight in the space I couldn’t get away, you know, there was ripped uniform and things of that nature and what it was enough, you know, to definitely cause fear and anxiety. Uh… I don’t like enclosed places like these guys are very cool but if you weren’t in a room and the door would not be shared and I wouldn’t be in here with him. 

00:15:20
DAVID W. SUTHERLAND What I was going through, those things that made me survive on the battlefield, the hypervigilance, paranoia, anger, sleeplessness… These are all trained and you execute those same things for months on the battlefield because they are what keep you alive and then I came home and I didn’t feel like I fit in with my family, but I have a very strong and very patient family, but when you don’t smile for two years and the responses where you have a disorder. No, I don’t. These trained responses and battle don’t just turn off when you come home, but I couldn’t figure out what was going on, and when I started talking and people started not only listening but hearing me, I started feeling comfortable in my own skin again. 

00:16:30
PAULA J. CAPLAN When the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began, I thought I’m afraid I know what’s going to happen because our country is now more psychiatrist, everything’s considered a mental illness than during any other war. And I had a mental image like those old World War II era newsreels on a huge screen and the image was the veterans from the new wars pouring back to this country, many of them devastated, tormented and I thought I know what’s going to happen. Not only therapists but the whole country will say, "Oh, we know what that is, that’s a mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder." So here’s what you do you go see a therapist close the door behind you, because we don’t really want to hear about it and take your drugs. And what I had feared has indeed come to pass, the wholesale diagnosing of mental illness in veterans. 

00:17:30
KATHY PLATONI I want to tell you about how PTSD came to be created. It was after the Vietnam War and the suffering of so many veterans was being ignored. So a group of people with wonderful intentions, got together and said, "Let’s make a list of the ways that we are seeing the suffering. They put on the list, emotional numbness, hypervigilance, startling easily, flashbacks, nightmares and so on and then they said, "Great idea, let’s get this cluster of kinds of suffering in psychiatric diagnostic manual," because they felt that would dignify it, that would somehow make it more real. And so they got it included and here’s what’s really interesting, when it first went in there, there was a sentence that said, this was a normal reaction for an abnormal experience. So if you were a therapist and we’re going to give someone that label, you could read that sentence aloud to them and say, "You’re just having a normal understandable reaction." It was still kind of strange because if that’s the case what is it doing in a manual of mental disorders, but at least that sentence was a saving grace. But then in 1994, when the next edition of the manual came out, that sentence was removed, so PTSD is only a mental illness. There are reasons some veterans want this label, one, is that for many of them, it’s the only way anyone has ever said to them, I believe your suffering. How about we say instead, "I believe you’re suffering?" Instead of saying, you have to let me call you mentally ill for me to believe you’re suffering and try to help you. Another reason, some veterans like getting a PTSD label, is that it’s a way for them to obtain benefits, which of course they deserve but as some have said, it ought to be possible to get benefits without having to be called mentally ill. And the label is a way for them to get services. Now those services too often consists of therapy and drugs that have not been shown to work well enough, and in the case of drugs, they are often shown to be harmful. When you get diagnosed with a mental illness, you’re almost certainly going to be placed on a psychiatric medication. Veterans probably more than anyone else are likely to be placed on not just one, but on many. I know of many cases where veterans had been prescribed 3, 6 or 12 or even hefty bags filled with psychiatric medications. Too many have already died as a result of over-prescription of these drugs.

00:20:15
PAULA J. CAPLAN Journalist Robert Whitaker wrote about this. He looked at data from two very mainstream organizations, the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Mental Health, and here’s what he found. Every psychiatric drug does help some people sometimes at least for a while but far more often every one of those drugs does more harm than good, and the drug companies are deficient enough in doing adequate research about one of their drugs, almost no research has done about how these drugs interact with each other. So veterans as well as many others in this country are guinea pigs. They are being subjected to unexplored harm. Back in the Civil War, what did they call it when someone had been in battle and was tormented, they called it Soldier’s Heart. I think that’s beautiful. It’s also very honest. It was being a soldier that hurt your heart and after that until PTSD came along, there were other terms that also had a war word in them, they were all telling the truth about what caused the upset, war trauma, shellshock, combat fatigue, but now we have post traumatic stress disorder. If I say someone who’s going to walk in and tell us they have PTSD, what do we know? We know they’ve been through something terrible, but it puts a curtain because of its vagueness between them and us. If they say I was in Iraq, if they say my sergeant raped me, we get it. Those fears that veterans have that non-veterans won’t understand them, the more specific, the more we can use the words the poets and the novelists use, an ordinary people use to use, the more we create the possibility of connection between veterans and others. The next word is stress, everybody’s stressed. Your massage therapist tells you, too much stress in your life. In more than a dozen years of listening to veterans, let me tell you what I’ve heard, I’ve heard about heartbreaking grief, despair, terror, guilt, shame, loss of innocence, moral anguish, existential and spiritual crisis. To my mind, to call that stress is hurtful. Then the word disorders what makes it a mental illness, there’s been a move to get rid of the "D". Let’s not call it a disorder, that’s fine as far as it goes, but if I say to you, somebody has post traumatic stress, it’s going to be years if not generations before you stop thinking "D". I say PTS, you think, D, disorder. So maybe we should think about going back to the words that help us understand each other, words like fear, despair, anguish and grief. 

00:23:05
KATHY PLATONI During the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, the military recruited and they hired hoards more therapists and condone the prescribing a far more psychiatric drugs. They wanted to help. They saw that people were suffering. They even deployed a lot of therapists and a lot of drugs and ship them overseas into the combat theatre, so if you’re active duty military, you had your therapist and you had your drugs right there, but in spite of all those increases in those traditional approaches, the rates of suffering have skyrocketed. You may have heard that there were 22 veteran suicides a day but those reports stem from only 21 states, and the rates are actually much higher among older veterans from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. A big part of that reason is that they have been isolated for so much longer. Fifty eight thousand veterans are homeless every night and that doesn’t even include the ones who are so tormented and isolated that they disappear into the forest and the mountains. So there’s all that unknown silent suffering. As for substance abuse among veterans, abuse of drugs and alcohol first doubled and then tripled over a six year period, and is continuing to rise. And drugs and alcohol are used by about half of the veterans who commit suicide. Even if every one of those therapists is terrific and even if every psychiatric pill has been helpful and not harmful at the very least so much more is needed.

00:24:55
PAULA J. CAPLAN Dr. David Collier is a psychologist and Vietnam veteran. Based on decades of experience he has said, "If you want to help reduce veterans’ suffering, it doesn’t matter what kind of technique you use. What matters is the relationship between the two people." I said to him, "I hear from people who say they’d like to help but they think there’s nothing they can do because they’re not therapist." And I asked him, "What is it that you do that somebody who’s not a veteran and not a therapist can’t do?" And he said, "Absolutely nothing." He told me in our training programs, we pussy foot around and we use terms like empathy, but it’s really about love. Colonel David Sutherland who led a brigade during the surge in Iraq and I wrote about the four main reasons veterans killed themselves. You’d be amazed at how many people say, they must have been mentally ill before they joined the military. The first main reason we wrote about is that war is vile. 

00:25:55
DAVID W. SUTHERLAND On the battlefield, it is that place where you find a intersection between vileness and valor and where they cross the valor of our service members but the vileness of war. It is one of the most obscene things that you can imagine. 

00:26:15
PAULA J. CAPLAN The second main reason we wrote about his isolation, Jason Dominguez, an Iraq war vet said, when he came back from Iraq, he would look at people who had been close to before he left and he felt like they were in a bubble over there and he didn’t know if he would ever feel like he was back inside that bubble. The third main reason veterans killed themselves starts with being diagnosed as mentally ill. For veterans, as for anyone from getting a psychiatric label you can lose self-confidence, lose a job, or custody of a child, or security clearance, or the right to make decisions about your medical and legal affairs, your human rights. And the drugs are the fourth main reason because those drugs not only increase the rates of suicide but they also suppress the whole nervous system. Many of them making it hard even to know how they feel, make you more withdrawn. So it can be hard enough to find someone to connect with you if you’re a veteran. But if when someone is there to have a relationship with you, you don’t even know what you feel, it makes everything harder. The seed for the welcome Johnny and Jane home project, which is about non-veterans listening to veterans, came from a story I heard from Michelle Dillow, an Iraq War veteran. 

00:27:35
MICHELLE DILLOW When I came back from Iraq in 2006, I came back with the expectation that I would come back home to my family, my friends, go back to college and that everything would be how it was before I left. And when I came home, I realized that wasn’t the case, I came home with them uncomfortable feeling that I couldn’t find what I had before I have the same family and friends and roll back in my college courses but something was lingering. You know, I couldn’t figure out why I… I couldn’t sleep. I was so enraged to things people would say, umm… about their opinions about the war etcetera. You know, when people asking me questions like, "Did you kill somebody?" You know, those are… that’s not necessarily what a veteran wants to be asked when they come home from war. And so dealing with that and not knowing exactly how to deal with it, umm… I had a professor asked me to speak in a college course that was about military history. I began a personal dialogue about my own feelings about him, tell him that the class members, even though none of them are veterans, but they just… they were there to listen. So I began telling them my rage, you know, the fact that I can’t sleep, my anxiety and really bring it all back onto myself, "What is wrong with me that I can’t feel like a normal person?" And one student raised her hand and she said to me, "Don’t you think you’re being too hard on yourself?" And for me, that was such a pivotal moment because that’s the first time that someone had said something like that to me and I felt like, Yeah, maybe I am being too hard on myself." And at that point, I began to realize a factor of, you know, well, maybe this is my new normal. You know, I don’t necessarily have to go back to the same life I had before because war has changed me, so I need to accept my new normal and as soon as I began to accept that I begin to sleep better, umm… the rage started to go away and anxieties slowly started to drift away and just that group of students listening to me talk, really helped my progression back into civilian life. 

00:29:45
PAULA J. CAPLAN People often ask me how much training do I need to listen to a veteran, and I say about 37 seconds, there are two sentences you will speak and as for the rest, you just listen. The first sentence is the one you use to begin the session, you say… 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN As a citizen of this country, I feel a certain sense of responsibility for the time that you spent in the military and coming home. So if you’d like to talk, I’m here to listen for as long as you want to talk and I promise not to judge. 

00:30:15
PAULA J. CAPLAN And then you just wait. We even take care not to say tell your story because if you’ve been traumatized, that’s fragmenting, so it’s fine if the veteran describes a smell they remember, an image, an incident, a buddy that they’ve lost and there will be silences. The crucial part is to listen with 100% of your attention and your whole heart. You don’t ask questions. It’s not an interview and it’s certainly not therapy. You don’t ask them to define military terms because what matters is not your understanding every single detail but that you’re giving them a chance to speak. And the point isn’t about what you think, the point is what they want to say, your silence clears the path for them to come forward. The second sentence comes well into the session and you say it, if the veteran described some terrible experience and says how it affects them now.

UNKNOWN The fired experience what you had, what you did, you know, I’m sure I’d be going to the same thing. I have nightmares, flashbacks and then even insomnia but that’s a deeply human reaction. There’s no mental illness. You are not crazy.

KATHY PLATONI Spiritual advisor Henri Nouwen and said this about listening, "Listening is much more than allowing another to talk while waiting for a chance to respond. Listening is paying full attention to others and welcoming them into our very beings. The beauty of listening is that those who are listened to start to feel accepted. They start taking their own words more seriously and discovering their true selves." 

00:32:10
PAULA J. CAPLAN We have forgotten as a culture about the astonishing power of listening. At Harvard Kennedy School, we had listening sessions for veterans from World War II to the present and then we asked them, "What if anything was good about this and what if anything is bad?" The answers were only positive. Many said it was the only time they’d ever been given a chance to speak without interruption, without judgment. They were grateful that the person listening was planning to diagnose them, just bearing witness. 

00:32:40
The listener should not be a close family member or friend. 

00:32:40
MICHELLE DILLOW One thing I have realized it was easier to talk to a non-veteran that wasn’t necessarily a member of my family or even somebody I knew because with… with the stranger, it’s… it’s more like you have an open forum. There’s no barriers of feeling like you have to protect someone, it’s like a burden gets lifted off of your shoulders because you can finally say those things you’re afraid to say to the people that you really care about. I feel that having, a listening session with, you know, just a non-veteran uh… regular person on the other side of town or your community would be more fortunate than talking to a therapist in the… in the reason of the fact that when you’re talking to a therapist, you… you feel like you’re being diagnosed and that’s one thing that, you know, would kind of be a barrier or a judgment of… or if… if I say this certain thing, is this person going to say that I’m mentally ill, are they’re going to say that I have a disorder, are they going to call me crazy, and when you do speak to someone you want to be able to have that open forum that you feel like you can say whatever you want and that person is not going to judge you for it. 

00:33:55
ALAN PIETRUSZEWSKI If I’m talking to a civilian, I think I’m less likely to be concerned about being judged, not mainly as a military guy or be worried that someone’s going to tell my CEO and it’s gonna affect my promotion or whatever and so if… if… if there was if I say… everything I say there’s one takeaway, I would just say to civilians. You know, you don’t necessarily need to be able to understand what he feels, you don’t need to have gone through what he feels, you don’t need to have had a similar loss in your own family, sometimes it’s just having an ear. 

00:34:25
NEHRU V. HARPER Some of us experience military sexual trauma, you know, in the war. Some of us did not do it in the war, you know, but it happens and it’s real and people are suffering from it, you know. And I mean, it just assess degree sometimes that even on the highway, you know, something can trigger and I’ll just kinda lose it, and we don’t always lose limbs. You know, it’s not always physical, you know, emotional as well. I love this country, this country needs to learn how to love me, black, gay and female, just love me.

PAULA J. CAPLAN A man who served four years in Laos Vietnam and Cambodia, had attended groups at the vet center for years and found them helpful. He was listened to by my mother who was 88 at the time and said afterward, he told her things he’d never told anyone and he was able to make connections between thoughts and feelings that he’d never understood before. Another veteran said her listening session inspired her to write a novel and a screenplay and she was accepted into a prestigious writing program. Still another veteran had been seriously suicidal for decades after coming back from war, he had one listening session with a member of his community and when I ran into him eight months later, he told me that since that session, he had stopped thinking of killing himself. 

00:35:55
ALAN PIETRUSZEWSKI It’s different when it’s someone who hasn’t served saying, "Hey, I wanna help you," you know, all about is I wanna help you, like, oh, it’s because we feel this bond. But when somebody is never served as like I want to help you, that’s kind of a tearing them and then you’re like, wow, wow, you feel that. 

00:36:10
PAULA J. CAPLAN Listeners described positive transformations in themselves. They say that hearing the veterans speak about their life and death experiences or their moral anguish made them aware of the veterans humanity and therefore of their own. Veterans are the forward observers to life and death for the rest of us. 

00:36:30
ALAN PIETRUSZEWSKI I came into the vet room, fat, dumb and happy young lieutenant and I walked in and see the (inaudible) the CEO in tears. It’s not something I’d ever seen since and I’ve never seen before. And it’s… you immediately process something’s bad and it’s really bad but you have no idea what it is. And then someone says, "Oh yeah, (inaudible) dead." It’s just silence like. And you have to process that, however, you’d process grief. And then open the drawer and put it on the next flight. 

00:37:05
Sometimes it was hard to know who was the enemy 

00:37:05
ISAAC POPE I will live one (inaudible) And saw a place that was some bushes was like piled up, and I went to the edge of the bushes, and a guy was down there in a hole with a machine gun right up in my face. And there it was. And when I found out it was one of the 101st Airborne troops had been dropped by parachute. And he was standing right there with that gun, with his machine gun pointed right at me, you know. I don’t know why he didn’t shoot, I really don’t. Right today, I don’t know why he didn’t kill me. 

00:37:45
JEROME A. CAPLAN I would see bodies that were stood up on stakes, on picket fences, and you see these bodies… just you know, in position, just frozen. But the saddest thing was to see a GI lying there, and the picture that always will remain with me, the one GI lying in the snow, with his whole back, just exploded out. And that’s one of the most moving things that stays with you through the war. Individual things like that, not the overall picture. Or the smell of burning flesh close to a tank, where it’s a GI tank, and you know that the boys in there were burned. That’s sad, considerably. 

00:38:30

00:38:35
PAULA J. CAPLAN To be sure veterans have had experiences that we have not had. But as Gloria Steinem has said, "People with different histories can trade abilities. So our differences become sources of learning from each other." Some veterans will say listening session, I don’t need it, if you’re in the military you’re not supposed to need anything, you’re supposed to take care of everybody else. We remind them this is not therapy, it’s about connecting you with someone in your community who’s not there to diagnose you, just to listen. Some veterans consider doing a listening session a way to continue to serve. Because they know in a visceral way that the rest of us don’t know how war illiterate and military illiterate the rest of us are. By speaking to a listener, they help educate the populace. Sometimes a veteran is hesitant to do a listening session because they’re afraid of what might come out, that they might end up more upset than before. We point out, it’s completely up to them to choose what to say. And we ask them, not only right after the session but also a month later how it was for them. The fears that they had had ahead of time including about how the listener would react, turned out to be unfounded. 

00:39:50
DAVE CULMER First of all, guys mostly don’t talk about combat, you come back home and from, you know, from Chrysler was a corporal back to the first battles of Jericho, guys didn’t talk about battle, about combat to people who were not there and the same thing it pertains today. Because you don’t understand it’s… it’s, if you ever began to talk about it, you may not stop, and the people who will be listening would be shocked to death. So you’re just kinda let it go and talk about it. 

00:40:25
DAVID W. SUTHERLAND And once I started talking about it, once I started sharing and once people started listening, I became much more comfortable. I got to share on my terms, not someone else’s agenda and when you do that, that’s pretty powerful. 

00:40:45
[music] 

00:40:50
PAULA J. CAPLAN People have asked me, "What if the veterans politics are different from the listener’s politics?" It turns out not to matter because this is that human connection, to illustrate that let me tell you a story I heard from one Iraq War veteran. A man told me that he had enlisted because he wanted to help liberate Iraq and help protect this country. He had gone to Iraq, been injured in every organ of his body and sent home. He said to me, "I did help liberate Iraq and I did help protect this country and I go back again in a minute. But the army won’t let me because I’m too injured," and then because I just listened here’s what he said with long silences after each sentence, "But every night when I’m trying to go to sleep, I hear a woman’s scream. You see there was a woman across from us and we thought she had dynamite and was going to kill us and I killed her and we found out she did have dynamite and she would have killed us, but every night when I’m trying to go to sleep, it’s her scream I hear, because I wasn’t raised to kill." People across the country whether they support or oppose a war or war in general, here is someone who thought his words right, he was proud of what he had done and would go back in a moment. but he’s tormented and if that torment is experienced in isolation. People are going to blow up, the suffering is transforming this country in ways that we cannot even conceive. 

00:42:35
FRANK GUZMAN What… what’s out there for me that I want that everybody else saying, civilian life is so much better but what’s out there for me, what am I gonna do, how I, you know, continue my income, you know, how I get medical, you know. 

00:42:50
NEHRU V. HARPER Do I know what happened to the guys that, you know, tried to have their way with me. I don’t, you know, but I’d live with it. I remember it, you know. I take medication so I can sleep at night because of it. I still believe in the camaraderie of the military. I really do and I’ll always believe in it no matter what. So you know, I’m a sailor, that’s what I am. 

00:43:15

00:43:25
DAVE CULMER I… I just was not comfortable. I stayed in house for about literally close to about 30 days, I went out minimally a few hours, maybe an hour a day lunch (inaudible) outside. I just was not comfortable. And I drank a lot and spent about 100 bucks a day for 30 days. Everything was… everything was different and fine and not… not like I left it. 

00:43:50
ALAN PIETRUSZEWSKI Now when you’re back from a mission and your… and your on stand down or whatever, that’s when everything starts flooding in and yeah you have friends there and that’s… that’s great. John, Bill, Mary (inaudible) Ted are my best friends right now, but I… but I don’t mean (inaudible) remember that we’ll come out but two things, one, there’s going to be a point where they rotate out and new people rotate in this part of the business, and two, in our business like tomorrow, Bill, Ted, John or Mary might not come back, they could be dead. And I think I had 19, 8 year friends who sounds really bad. I would just say they’re more, they’re remotes, you know, people died while I served and I still have nightmares about airplane crashes, 98%, 99% aircraft crash dreams. 

00:44:40
RICKY RYBA I was tested a lot mentally and physically and there is a lot of times where I thought I had hit my breaking point. And I thought I was gonna give up and I was having this inner battle in my head of give up, no, don’t give up and you’re weak and you can’t do this and, no, you’re strong and… and keep going, keep fighting. 

00:45:05
DAVE CULMER Takes a little getting use to, to get back and be normal. As well where the sharing, my last bastion of resistance to becoming a part of this society, that’s the reason I (inaudible).

PAULA J. CAPLAN The welcome Johnny and Jane Home project happens in various ways, sometimes just one listener goes to a veteran’s home or a veterans organization post or library and just sits and listens. A Mansfield, Ohio community organizers Steve Stone, created a consortium of three campuses, the airbase and veterans and community representatives to do listening sessions. 

00:45:55
KATHY PLATONI In 2011, Vietnam veteran, Ted Engelmann heard about the welcome John and Jane Home project and suggested there be national days of listening to veterans. When he was Rhode Island governor, Lincoln Chafee, issued a proclamation for listening to veterans day, any city or state or the US Congress could do the very same to convey the idea that you can go beyond thanking veterans for their service. You can actually listen to them. 

00:46:30
PAULA J. CAPLAN David E Jones, a Vietnam veteran wrote poetry to deal with his war trauma. His book A Soldier’s Story, The Power of Words includes these lines from a poem about how it feels if you’re a veteran and a non-veteran just listens to you. "Directions I do not provide with this, you only need a heart and if you understand a vet, you’ve made a small… small start."

PAULA J. CAPLAN Now that I have listened to many veterans, I’ve gone back and watch my father’s video again, this time absorbing every word, every image, every detail. Listening to veterans and also to non-veterans who’ve been there listeners has immersed me in matters of life and death, of love and joy, of fear and more of anguish. More of the richness of humanity than anything I have ever done and my journey has taken me from listening to my do father but not hearing him to listening to other veterans and hearing my father in them. 

00:47:45
Dedicated to my late father, Jerome A. Caplan, an Army Captain in WWII; to Isaac Pope, who served as his 1st sergeant; and to all veterans from whom we learn… when we listen
