Michael Yapko, PhD 

00:00:35
MICHAEL YAPKO I think that what I’d like to do is begin by just offering a few general ideas about why hypnosis? Why bother? What can hypnosis add to the clinical interaction? And then I’ll provide some self-selection criteria for any of you that might be thinking about the possibility of volunteering to be my partner in this endeavor. I’ll provide some self-selection criteria. You know, the role of hypnosis has been a source of endless fascination for me for more than 30 years now. Certain things, certain phenomenon that you witness in the realm of hypnosis that are really in many ways quite remarkable, things that revolve around, very often, unconscious processes, a person doesn't really even know how they simulate suggestions and form responses to them, and it's particularly true when you are working in the physiological domain, encouraging people to experience such hypnotic phenomena, analgesia or anesthesia for pain management. But this is a psychotherapy conference and that's really what I'm going to be demonstrating as ways that you might consider applying hypnosis in the context of psychotherapy. Well, why do that? Why bring hypnosis into the process? For a number of reasons. First of all, most basically, every therapy involves suggestion inevitably. As soon as you say to someone, here is how I'd like you to think about this or here is how I'd like you to look at this or here is the feeling I'd like you to focus on, you are using suggestion. And the artistry of using suggestion skillfully is really what the study of hypnosis is all about. Secondly, so many of the problems, perhaps even all of the problems that we’re ultimately asked to treat involve problems with focus, focus in terms of the direction of the focus, the quality of the focus that the person engages with aspects of their experience that work against them. They are focused on their feelings when they should be thinking. They are thinking, when they should be focused on their feelings. They are focused internally when they should be paying attention to what's happening out there. They are focused out there when they should be paying attention to what's happening in here. So it's always a question of what is the direction of focus that we want to encourage, and what about the quality of the focus, the intensity of the focus, the ability of the person to engage. Why is that there are some people that, as you start introducing ideas to them, they can rivet their attention to what you are doing, and then there’s other people that are just all over the place. How can we use a focusing technique like hypnosis to enhance focus. Third, no matter what form of therapy you choose to practice, every model of treatment amplifies some element of experience. That if you are going to do cognitive therapy, you are going to focus on cognition. If you are going to medicate people, you are going to focus on physiology. If you are going to do emotionally focused therapy, you are going to focus on people's emotions. And so, the salient clinical question is always what part of the person do we want to engage with and why? What ultimately proves to be therapeutic for people? And I think what really makes sense to me, what clinical experiences taught me is that any aspect of a person's experience can be valuable to focus on, but then it's a question of when and why and for what purpose. And so, it's an important point to appreciate that hypnosis isn't a therapy, hypnosis is a vehicle for introducing ideas, whether those ideas are cognitively based or emotionally based or physiologically based or behaviorally based. How can I absorb this person in whatever element of experience he’s ultimately going to enrich them, empower them, enhance them? Now that idea that hypnosis isn't a therapy is a really important one to start this with, because people will often ask the question, so how does hypnosis compare to XYZ therapy for treating depression or anxiety or whatever? And, of course, that isn't the relevant question to ask. The relevant question to ask is, if we do XYZ therapy without hypnosis and we do XYZ therapy with hypnosis, will the hypnosis enhance the treatment results? And when you look at the therapeutic efficacy literature, when you look at the broad base of empirical support for hypnosis, it's exactly what you discover. Hypnosis enhances the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis enhances the effects of interpersonal therapy, hypnosis enhances the merits of behavioral activation. So it's always about how you structure the ideas that you want to present to someone, the techniques that you are using, do you want the person less focused or more focused, do you want them responding more on one level or more on another level and basically when you think about the problems that we're asked to treat, almost invariably the solutions that we are looking for, the things that are really going to make a difference for people lie just outside the boundaries of what they already know and what they already experience. How do I broaden those parameters, broaden those boundaries, enlarge the frame in which this person lives? And so, even though, the common mythology is that somehow hypnosis is going to restrict somebody's choices or that you are somehow programming this person to think in a particular way or act a particular way, nothing could be farther from the truth. As you watch this session unfold, what you are going to see me do repeatedly is talk about possibilities, introduce possibilities of things that could be focused on, things that could be considered, things that could be learned from, things that could enlarge those boundaries as the person discovers whatever it is, is going to ultimately be helpful. So there isn't any formula for this. It's not as if I can always focus on this element or that element of their experience. There are people who are already so steeped in one element of experience that it's out of balance, the other aspects, the complementary aspects of their experience just aren’t well developed, and I can start to orient the person to that and engage them with it. Hypnosis amplifies experience. And if you ask me what the simplest way is to describe what goes on with hypnosis, it's about building a frame of mind. How can I absorb this person in a way of thinking, a way of relating, a way of self-organizing that helps them move a step closer, perhaps many steps closer to what they are trying to experience in their life. So it is very much a process of empowerment and it is very much a process of introducing possibilities and then dealing with utilizing, accepting, the choices that people make as they discover new possibilities in their own behalf. Now I came into this demonstration hour without a partner to work with in this process. And let me give you some of the self-selection criteria for this. Obviously, first of all, whatever the problem is that you present to me is got to be one that you feel comfortable talking about here, as well as the fact that it's going to be recorded and it's going to be out there. So it's got to be something you feel okay talking about. I'm not going to ask a lot of questions, but I will ask some. And you will even notice from the quality of the questions that I ask, I'm really aiming at doing one particular thing and that is trying to understand how you generate the kinds of experiences that you are having that you want help with. I'm not particularly interested in exploring why. You can speculate endlessly about why, but I'm real interested in how. How do you get from here to there when you want to go somewhere else. So, a second self-selection criterion, it would - - it's important that it not be somebody who has already been a volunteer for other demonstrations. So we really strive here at this conference to open it up to as many people as possible and create new opportunities. So that's an important thing. And, really the problem itself is the third self-selection criterion, it could be helpful if it was a relatively circumscribed problem, as opposed to something much more pervasive, now is not the time to present your personality disorder to me or the fact that you have more than a casual interest in farm animals. So we want to keep it a relatively circumscribed kind of problem. So with those as the self-selection criteria -- and if you’ve had some experience with hypnosis that helps, but it’s certainly not critical by any stretch of imagination. Is there anybody that feels like volunteering to do a session? You do? Okay. Come on up. First things first. We need to get you to sign a release form. And try not to notice the clause that says you are taking over my car payments. Ah, she signed it. Okay. I'm home-free. Now for the rest of you, as you are observing this process, let me kind of draw your attention to what your role in this is. You know, while I'm interviewing her, it doesn't really matter to me very much what you do, but as we move into the hypnotic part of the experience, it would be really nice if we had a quiet environment to do that. So if you would mind, double check, in that your phones are off and at least silence that would be very helpful to the process. She's being very generous in volunteering and we certainly want to make sure that this is a useful experience for her. 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. What’s that? The first thing to work on is wiring. Okay. Thanks for volunteering so much. Have a seat, please. What is your name? 

00:12:25
EVE Eve. 

00:12:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Eve? And, Eve, what would you like help with? 

00:12:30
EVE Ahem…I'm in the process of getting ready to go through a divorce. I won’t reveal like all the messy details or anything. But I'd been married for 18 years. And I have three children. And it's a really hard decision. I was - - we were in very fundamentalist church and so we have very traditional rules and I became extremely dependent, subservient, thinking that I was pleasing God. And after becoming a counselor, I had some enlightenment and I'm just having a really hard time. I'm like on the edge of the diving board. My husband is aware of my plans and intentions. But I'm like on the end of the board when I was a child, trying to get ready to dive into the deep and I just don't quite have the confidence or the inner assurance that it’s really right? 

00:13:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. So, how did you go about making this, obviously, critical decision in your life? 

00:13:45
EVE Ahem…Awareness that there was not an emotional relationship and that although I have no hateful or harsh feelings towards my husband, he is not willing, not interested or not able to change, and there was emotional and verbal abuse and things like that. 

00:14:10
MICHAEL YAPKO And so, when you were making the decision, you came to the conclusion there was nothing more that could really change here? 

00:14:15
EVE Right. We've tried counseling. 

00:14:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And that the best thing to do would be to extricate yourself from the situation. 

00:14:25
EVE Right. 

00:14:25
MICHAEL YAPKO And so, now, as you are standing on the edge of the diving board, not really quite there yet, having to do this, you are at the earlier stages, it sounds like, of getting this process going, what are the things that you are concerned about in doing this? 

00:14:45
EVE I haven't balanced a check book in 20 years -- 18 years. I haven't have been allowed -- been allowed to pay the bills or be aware of those things. I got my own bank account now. So I'm taking baby steps and paying my own bills. But it's on a small scale. I'm afraid of upsetting my children's lives. And just really being able to handle and put it altogether, because I had heard for so many years that I was incompetent. 

00:15:20
MICHAEL YAPKO You went back to school to pursue counseling? How did you decide that you could do that and would do that? 

00:15:30
EVE Well, I had a positive counseling experience and I was really fascinated with the way the counselor like flipped my switches in my brain and I felt, that’s fascinating. I want to do that. That's really cool. And I've always been a good student. That's one of the areas that I didn't lose confidence in. 

00:15:55
MICHAEL YAPKO You know you could do it. 

00:15:55
EVE I know I could do it. 

00:15:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And in this counseling experience, where the counselor flipped the switch, how did the counselor do that? 

00:16:05
EVE Maybe he embedded suggestions. I don't really remember the exact process. But she would say something and then like offer a possibility. But I was very rigidly not considering, I guess -- and my goal, yeah, I could do that. And one of the first suggestions was what would happen if you went to a different church? And I was like, well, you know, and then I thought, well, I really could do it. And I did within like two weeks. I did it. She said, what would be the worst thing that could happen? And I told her the worst things that could happen. She said, could you live with that? I said, yeah, I could live with that. And so I did. 

00:16:50
MICHAEL YAPKO It's good therapy, isn't it? 

00:16:50
EVE Yeah. 

00:16:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Being able to discover that what seems so intimidating on one level turns out to be manageable. Not necessarily easy, not necessarily pleasant, but manageable. Alright, so in preparing yourself now for this big transition that’s going to be happening in your life, do you feel like you have a plan for how you’re going to go about doing this? 

00:17:25
EVE Well, I have bits and pieces of a plan. So, I don't have like a formal written plan. 

00:17:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you have a sense of timing about it? 

00:17:40
EVE Yes, definitely by this summer. I am a teacher in a day job, and there would be practically a good time that would give us time to sell the house, or whatever, you know, gives him time to plan as well. 

00:18:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Tell me a little bit about being a teacher. 

00:18:00
EVE Sorry. I live here in Central Florida area, and I teach second grade. 

00:18:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Really? 

00:18:10
EVE And I enjoy it. So it's pleasant. I like interacting with the kids. 

00:18:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

00:18:20
EVE I don't like planning. That's probably why I don't have a formal plan. 

00:18:25
MICHAEL YAPKO The lesson plans can get tedious, can't they? 

00:18:30
EVE Especially the life lesson plans. 

00:18:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. So, when you are dealing with second graders, what's it like for you? 

00:18:45
EVE Ahem…I'm very centered and very calm. I'm not - - I'm emotionally engaged with them. But I'm not a - - I don't get like angry at misbehavior. I feel like that's within themselves and I try to help them or ignore it or -- but I don't get angry about it. And it’s kind of like, oh, I see you chose to do this. I’m wondering why you did that. And then, well, you know your consequences. And they are like, yeah, yeah, and they go move their glib(ph) or... 

00:19:10
MICHAEL YAPKO  How do you keep yourself from getting emotionally caught up in that? 

00:19:20
EVE Well, their behavior is not a reflection of me. So I don't take it personally. 

00:19:30
MICHAEL YAPKO You are that clear about it? 

00:19:30
EVE Yeah. 

00:19:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Good. Now tell me a little bit about any experience that you’ve had previously with hypnosis? Have you done this before? 

00:19:40
EVE It was a light trance at the University of Central Florida and it was introductory class and I volunteered there too. I thought I could learn more that way. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And how was the experience for you? 

00:19:55
EVE It was pleasant, it was focused on unloading anxiety like onto a pillar, and as the pillar was burdened down, I was lifted up. 

00:20:10
MICHAEL YAPKO How was that for you? 

00:20:15
EVE Well I sensed a positive experience. It felt -- it felt good. 

00:20:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Alright. Let's build on that. 

00:20:25
EVE Okay. 

00:20:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Are you ready? 

00:20:25
EVE Right. 

00:20:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Arrange yourself in whatever way is comfortable for you. And then once you get yourself situated you can begin by taking in a few deep relaxing breaths. Since you’ve already closed your eyes, you can start that process of building more internal focus for a while. For the next few minutes, Eve, going to be talking about different ideas, different possibilities. There isn’t really anything that you have to do right now. Nothing that you have to say, nothing in particular that you even have to experience. But it's a curious thing that when you start to focus internally, there is an opportunity to begin to explore aspects of yourself that you normally don't pay much attention to. 

00:22:05
[sil.] 

00:22:10
MICHAEL YAPKO You know how it is. You've heard the story many times in many different places of how someone is moving along a life path, just doing what they do and then something shifts and sometimes it's because of something very powerful from the outside. Sometimes it's from something very powerful from the inside. 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:10
MICHAEL YAPKO But starting to discover yourself, how your hands feel resting on your thighs. How your breath feels when you inhale, when you exhale. How your thoughts can drift in different directions as they grow quieter. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And with each passing moment... 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:15
MICHAEL YAPKO I'm inviting you in the most respectful way that I know how... 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:30
MICHAEL YAPKO ...to be with yourself in a way that's comfortable and accepting, because even when your thoughts go in different directions, which they naturally will, there is a growing momentum... 

00:25:05
[sil.] 

00:25:10
MICHAEL YAPKO ...as your thoughts get more focused, as your body grows more comfortable. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And when you sense the freedom, the freedom to explore which sensations are the most soothing, which images are the most comforting... 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:26:00
MICHAEL YAPKO ...and just how aware can you be of a just what moment your breathing slows and how much more effort it takes to have to think. 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:40
MICHAEL YAPKO There is a reason why I'm talking about exploring yourself, discovering your deeper self. You've learned a lot about your ability to get focused, your ability to get absorbed in a particular way of thinking and seeing the world. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And if any switches get flipped or then you already know how quickly an idea can change, how quickly a feeling can change, and how quickly life focus can change. And I don't know if you’ve come to appreciate just yet... 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:15
MICHAEL YAPKO ...that everyone that you are going to counsel one day and every student you teach, whatever grade they are in, but especially second grade, is in a process, a growth process, a developmental process. You are not where you were, Eve, and you are not yet who you are becoming, and it's this in-between place that is so filled with great possibilities, including the possibility of getting comfortable, not knowing... 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:45
MICHAEL YAPKO ...how does a second grade teacher, who doesn't particularly like doing lesson plans, you somehow evolve the ability to trust yourself to give these kids a good education and you don't really have to know ahead of time which kid is going to have a little bit of difficulty with reading or which one is going to have a little bit of difficulty with math, which one is going to be a little tired tomorrow. 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:50
MICHAEL YAPKO You trust yourself to deal with the spontaneity of what these kids present to you and have even learned to enjoy it. I have to believe that you tell some funny stories sometimes about amusing things that the kids say or do, the things that can't be planned. 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:31:45
MICHAEL YAPKO And in the same way that when you walked into your counselor's office she didn't know what you were going to present. And even when you came up here to meet me, to work with me, you didn't know what I was going to ask you, you didn't know what I was going to say or do, and somehow you had the strong sense you'd manage it, you'd manage it. And it's that element of your experience that as I focus you and encourage you to focus yourself on the comfort of not knowing, but knowing, and as you learned a long time ago, whichever pool you jump into, it's still just water and the same strokes apply. And this pool might be bigger and this pool might be smaller and the water might be a little cooler and it might be a little warmer. It's all different and it's all the same. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:15
MICHAEL YAPKO It's all different and we know the rest. And so, as you start to notice, how are you moving to new situations? Things that will inspire you, challenge you. There's something that you can easily remember. You didn't have any doubts about your ability to learn. You knew you could go back to school and would go back to school. And how you knew that? Well, that's what I'm encouraging you to get absorbed in, because when you were thinking about going back to school, you didn't know exactly which classes you were going to take, what the lectures would be about and what the papers would be about that you’d have to write. And I can give you a thousand examples of all the things that you didn't know, that you move through, because the most important thing was knowing that you know how to learn. You know how to use information. 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:15
MICHAEL YAPKO And what a difference when you find yourself getting deeply curious about what's next, deeply curious about how you will move through the uncertainty of what's next. And isn't that how you'll discover... 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:05
MICHAEL YAPKO ...your level of understanding, your level of foresight, your ability to think beyond the moment. 

00:38:30
[sil.] 

00:38:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Not everything can be predicted, but some things can. Can you predict how your experience will lead you to be skillful as a counselor? 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Can you predict that your experience as a teacher and being the instrument for shaping children's education and experience is going to serve you well when you're trying to teach people of all ages? 

00:39:50
[sil.] 

00:39:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And so you might be jumping into a new pool, but the characteristics of water really haven't changed. 

00:40:10
[sil.] 

00:40:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, here I've been talking about all kinds of things, from discovering that your breathing has changed, how comfortable your body is... 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:55
MICHAEL YAPKO ...and how deep your growing awareness is... 

00:41:05
[sil.] 

00:41:10
MICHAEL YAPKO ...for that trust of yourself... 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
MICHAEL YAPKO ...to move into unknown areas... 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:40
MICHAEL YAPKO ...that in a very different way you really do know and can know and will eventually know, and even knowing what you can't know. With all the different things that I have been talking about, it leads to me wonder, Eve, just what you’re aware of right now. And so, in just a moment, I'm going to ask you to describe out loud what you're experiencing and you can continue to be focused and relaxed and absorbed as you describe your experience and awareness and even with each word that you say how it can deepen your absorption and what matters right now, can you describe what you're experiencing? 

00:43:20
EVE Ahem…yes, I saw myself swimming when I was a child. We lived by the ocean and it was a -- it was the feeling of the exuberance of a child, an exploration. And, ahem… I remember my grandfather, he would take me out into the ocean, where I couldn't quite reach and he would tell me that the waves are going to come and he's going to hold me down and let the wave wash over me and I would be fine. And I would be afraid, I’d see the wave coming, he would hold me down, the water would go up my nose, I would be so angry and it wasn't until much later I realized -- I think he was trying to teach me that I could be overwhelmed, experience something really unpleasant, feel helpless and be able to walk out of the water and still be okay. 

00:44:35
MICHAEL YAPKO It's a great lesson, isn't it? It's a great lesson. I like your use of the word exuberance, the exuberance. But it starts with the curiosity, doesn't it? 

00:45:00
EVE Yes. 

00:45:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Or willingness to discover what's there. I'm always amazed that I encounter people from time to time that have so little curiosity about the world around them, nor they particularly interested in reading, not particularly interested in having discussions with people, or traveling, or hearing about other people's travels. And yet, there you are, everyday that you're teaching, you're modeling curiosity, the desire to know, whether it's knowing about reading or writing or geography or games, and I find it extraordinarily curious that you've built so much of your life around curiosity, without even realizing it. How easy it is to forget what the value of curiosity is. And here you are at an entirely new point in your life, or you can wonder about the choices you're going to make and whether you'll make them from a position of strength, which you can, whether you'll be driven by wanting to know what you really can do as a student, as a teacher, as a professional, as a woman. So many things, and what stays so immediately present across all these life experiences. It's not only the curiosity, but that exceptionally powerful lesson that your grandfather taught you, that in the short run was water up your nose, that in the long run was knowing that the waves would come and the waves could be bigger than you are, but they roll past, and you get to walk back out on to the sand, enjoying that sense of having done something challenging, uncomfortable, all the while building a sense... 

00:50:00
[sil.] 

00:50:05
MICHAEL YAPKO ....that you get to go beyond it, an exuberant curiosity and a curious confidence. 

00:50:25
[sil.] 

00:50:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, Eve, having spent this time together, I have no way of knowing whether it seemed very short or long, which moments you found the most inspiring and which perspectives the most challenging. All I know is that sense of curiosity, far, far outweighs... 

00:51:45
[sil.] 

00:51:50
MICHAEL YAPKO ...anything else, and so to move forward, or really what else is there to do? But you know, as well as I do, every step forward inevitably means leaving something behind. But what you carry with you, the tolerance and acceptance of uncertainty and that determination that the next step and then the next step and the next one moves you into the kind of life and lifestyle that you couldn’t have designed better if it had come with a lesson plan. So take whatever time you want to or need to, Eve, to process and absorb all those possibilities and really integrate them in the best and most powerful a voice. And then, when you feel like you've had enough time to do that and you feel like you're ready to, you can start the process of slowly reorienting yourself at a rate that's gradual and easy. 

00:54:40
[sil.] 

00:54:45
MICHAEL YAPKO That's right, deep breath, reorienting and letting your eyes open whenever you're ready.

MICHAEL YAPKO Hi. 

00:55:05
EVE  Hi. Ahem… 

00:55:10
MICHAEL YAPKO How are you doing? 

00:55:15
EVE What? 

00:55:15
MICHAEL YAPKO How are you doing? 

00:55:15
EVE  Ah, I’m doing great. 

00:55:20
MICHAEL YAPKO  Do you want to talk about it a little bit or would you prefer not to? 

00:55:30
EVE Yeah. Oh, no, I will. I think somatically my head floated away, moves up like up in a box about 12 feet, and my hands got extremely warm. I couldn't feel my chest and my legs couldn't move. I mean, they could a little bit. 

00:55:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Sure. 

00:55:55
EVE But they felt really heavy. And then there were a lot of images, some from my past, like the swimming and the waves. And then there were a lot of -- like mechanical pieces rotating and flipping and pieces fitting in and out, reconfiguring, and then behind that was like a sky with clouds moving. 

00:56:35
[sil.] 

00:56:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Do you think it was a useful experience? 

00:56:45
EVE What? 

00:56:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you think it was a useful experience? 

00:56:45
EVE I think it was useful. 

00:56:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, good. Okay. Would you be willing to respond to questions from the audience, if there are any? 

00:56:55
EVE Sure. 

00:56:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Would that be alright? We have just a couple of minutes left and you would need to go to the microphones, but if you have any questions for Eve about her experience, now is the time to ask them. Are there any? 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN  When you decided to go in for this experience, what specifically were you looking for in terms of a solution? Are you looking for support, are you looking for some answers from your inner strengths, what is it that you felt you'd get through this experience? 

00:57:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Are you asking me or are you asking Eve about her experience? 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN I’m asking Eve. 

00:57:45
EVE What was I hoping to get out of the hypnotic experience, was that the question? 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:57:55
EVE I guess I had an emotional sense of being paralyzed, in the sense of -- I’m able to move forward, but not wanting to go back. And, I guess, I was looking for courage, and I got exactly what I was looking for. I got something tangible -- mentally tangible, something that I could hold within myself and go forward. 

00:58:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And go forward. 

00:58:25
EVE Kind of like a symbol of strength. 

00:58:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. That's great. I think that's all we have time for, is that right? Okay, one more quick question. 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN I noticed you used the word curious an awful lot and even described in a lot of detail people who lack curiosity. Would you please elaborate maybe why you chose that particular word, or is that just part of, you know, your process? 

00:58:50
MICHAEL YAPKO No, it is in the standard part of my process, if that's what you mean. But, Eve is on the brink of a huge change in her life. And, of course, you can't predict exactly where it's going to go. So in facing the uncertainty, the uncertainty can either be a catalyst for fear, which is what you presented to me or the uncertainty can be a catalyst for curiosity, something that engages her with it. And so I was really focusing her on the curiosity as a catalyst for exploring these new possibilities in the most open of ways and making decisions based on what she wants and how she wants things to be, instead of reactively out of fear. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN Was there any particular reason why you also brought up the fact that it surprises you how some people lack curiosity? 

00:59:50
MICHAEL YAPKO  Why was I talking about people who lack curiosity? I'm using -- I was really using that as a means of reinforcing, exactly as I said to her, that she's -- without really realizing it, she's built her life around curiosity, what it means to be a teacher for these second graders day in and day out, and so I want her as I'm describing somebody who doesn't have curiosity, for her to be really clear in saying to herself that's not me and to reinforce for herself, you know, I am curious. I mean, think about what it takes for her to come up here and be willing to engage and be willing to explore herself in this context that takes not only curiosity, but guts. 

01:00:45
EVE Curious is my most passionate self appreciation, the feeling that I have for myself. It's interesting that you chose that. 

01:00:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, I meant what I said when I said you really built your life around it, and here is a whole new application. 

01:01:00
EVE Thank you. 

01:01:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. Thank you, Eve. I appreciate that so much. Thank you all for coming. I appreciate that. Take care everybody.
