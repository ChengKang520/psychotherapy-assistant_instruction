00:00:25
Please welcome Dr. Joseph Gone. 

00:00:30
JOSEPH GONE Well, good morning. You know it’s a little surprising to be up here this early talking to you about such serious matters. I think it’s actually dark outside. I’m really pleased to be here in honor to be invited to talk to you today. Before I start and addressing this really interesting and important question, I’d like to dedicate my remarks today to our really leader in our field, that leader is doctor Dr. Marigold Linton who received doctorate in experimental psychology from UCLA. Um…a number of decades ago, but who was recently, Um… (inaudible ) to receive a presidential award for excellence in science, mathematics and engineering mentoring by President Obama. Dr. Linton is an enrolled member of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and was an native psychologist, I’m sure she must be the only one in our discipline to ever be attending the White House next week to receive this medal for mentoring in science education at, Um… under such great auspicious. So I want to acknowledge her before we start here today. Continuing on well, I start by introducing myself briefly. 

00:01:35
Introduction • Introducing Myself • Academic Psychologist • Clinically-Trained • Community-Engaged • Culturally-Attuned •Research Interests •Cultural & Mental Health in Native North America • Ethics, Politics, & Practicalities of Meeting MH Needs • Cultural Psychology of Indigenous Life ways 

00:01:40
JOSEPH GONE I’m an Academic Psychologist who is clinically trained community-engaged and culturally-attuned in work that I do. I’m also a citizen of the grow want nation of Montana, we’re in northern plains Indian people my ancestors in fact were waiting for horsing and hunting buffalo, almost up to the birth of our disciple. And the birth of our disciple in part of what I’m going to talk about today. My research interest in Culture and Mental health in Native North America, the Ethics, Politic and Practicalities of Meeting metal health needs of American Indian people. And the cultural Psychology of selfhood, subjectivity, social relations and the therapeutic. I have current projects going on right now concerned with the integration of tradition healing practices for example into metal health services for native communities. 

00:02:20
Introduction • Introducing This Presentation • Goal is to address the question: "Is psychological science acultural?" • Constituent Tasks • Motivate the Question: NMCS interests • Clarify the question: Elucidating Key Terms • Expound on the Question: Benefits & limitations 

00:02:25
JOSEPH GONE In terms of this presentation here, the goal of my talk as you’ve heard is to consider relations between cultural process and psychological science. In addressing the question is psychological science a culture. There are four constituent tasks that we’ll consider. The first is to motivate this question relative to our interest here at the multicultural summit. The second is to clarify the question by elucidating certain key terms. The third will be to answer the question by tracing the relation between culture, science and psychology. And finally I will expound on this question by considering the benefits and limitations of psychological science for multicultural psychology. I planned to talk to you today for no more than about 50 minutes and then we’ll have chance to move on and discuss these things throughout the day. 

00:03:10
Motivation the Question • First Nations Behavioral Health Association • Dialogue with SAMHSA •Science-Based Funding Policy • Limited "Model" Programs • Dilemma for Indian country • Community Objections • 

00:03:10
JOSEPH GONE So let’s start with a bit of a narrative a few years ago I was elected to the board of the directors at the first nations behavioral health association. This board is comprised of most of the American-Indian psychologist and Dr. Jeff King in the audience is currently the president of this association. The mission of the first nations behavioral health association is "to provide leadership to all groups institutions and individuals who plan provide and access native American behavioral health services. For those of you know behavioral health refers to mental health and substance abuse treatment services as well. First nations behavioral association was created to advice SAMHSA on native American issues. And SAMHSA the substance abuse and mental health service administration, this is the federal agency that funds, the public behavioral health safety net in this country. It’s a… allocates nearly $4 billion in funds to communities throughout the country, to provide a substance abuse treatment and mental health interventions. SAMHSA policy at the time that I joined the first nation behavioral health association some years ago was that it only funded grants adopted certain pre-designated "model" programs for behavioral health intervention and treatment. And these model program are identified on the basic of evidence so some ways this was an evidence based a policy that referred to a sort list who wasn't so assured I guess, but when it comes to Indian country I was assured. Evidence based intervention that have been subjected to scientific evaluation. For the standard of evaluation for qualifying a model program was not as rigorous as the imperially supportive treatments that are designated say by the American psychological association task force. Nevertheless very few of these model programs were developed for years with American Indians. One common example was Teresa LaFromboise as American Indian life skills curriculum for suicide prevention, but that was one of the few. And I think that, Um…this was the really important example of how science based government policy can influence behavioral health practice. Well this policy of…of designated these model programs by SAMHSA created a real dilemma for Indian country where there are wide speared community objections to mainstream behavioral health intervention. Persistent complaints citing the relevance of these for native behavioral health programs on the basic of culture incommensurability. Common place assertions that locally familiar therapeutic alternative would work better than whatever the main stream has to offer and it was not uncommon in many of our communities to hears folks quite passionately assert we know what works in our community. Is not this stuff, is something you don’t know about, so just fund us to do this, these…it also resulted in critical pronouncement(ph) than that such a restrictive funding policy reflected ongoing colonization. Now I think this points to the centrality of culture, knowledge and power in American Indian behavioral health intervention. And it speaks to broad concerns about the monoculture flavor of evidence based practice in psychology in the metal health fields, engender suspicion about the ideology of science as it pertains to psychosocial intervention or ideology refers to masked or hidden agenda’s carried out by those in power. For those of us who care about the psychological aspects of culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio and economic class and other aspects of human diversity. Such science based policies and practice can lead us to wonder and to worry is there something inherently acultural or even anti-cultural about science. Especially this apply to the study of human mind and behavior. 

00:06:50
Clarifying the Question 

00:06:50
JOSEPH GONE Before addressing this question we’ll make sure that we understand the question. So it be helpful I think to briefly elucidate the key term that constitute this question. And the key terms that I want to basically elaborate on our culture, science and psychological science. 

00:07:05
Clarifying the Question • Elucidation of Key Terms• What is culture? shared, patterned and historically reproduced symbolic practices that both facilitate and constrain meaningful human existence 

00:07:05
JOSEPH GONE I purposefully plan to elucidate or elaborate and not define these term, because straightforward definitions remain elusive for most of these. Let’s start with the easy one. What is culture? Well this is not easy as you might think anthropologist have struggled with this question for as long there has been cultural anthropology. For example in 1852 anthropologist Kroeber and Kluckhohn reviewed 164 definitions of culture in their mammoth book devoted to the question. Suffice(ph) to say that we’re not going to make appreciable headway in remedying this problem with definition today. Nevertheless for the purpose of the discussion culture may be understood to be shared, patterned and historically reproduced symbolic practices that both facilitate and constrain meaningful human existence. Practices are key here, things people do in their lives whether it acts or words or even thoughts, in part because our thinking is structured by language. Culture is shared because most practices are learned form others. There is no such thing as a culture of one. Culture as pattern because such practices are organized and utilized systematically, in order to be intelligible to other they are not randomly created with each usage but are handed down, so that they're shared and these in patterns in these important ways. Culture is historically reproduces in that subsequent generation are socialized into using the intelligible practices of their communities. Otherwise we are not talking about transmission here, but reproduction which allows for innovation over time. Finally cultural practices are symbolic and that they allow for the ascription and interpretation and communication of meaning or intelligibility to others, language is an obvious examples of this. Moving(ph) this down we may think of culture then as patterns of activity, interaction, and interpretation or even future still simply shared beliefs and practices. 

00:09:00
• Classic Examples: language, ritual, kinship, economy • Such practices can seem natural. Fish in water • Emotion, communion, time orientation 

00:09:05
JOSEPH GONE Classic examples include language, ceremony and ritual family organization and kinship relations, economic activities, if we pick up those old cultural anthropology style ethnographies from the 30s and the 40s they’ll see chapters with these headings. But what's important to remember is that many important cultural practices are invisible to fluent practitioners and seem natural just like an fish in water as really trouble to finding or describing what wetness feels like. I think it’s difficult for us to recognize the cultural constitution say of our emotional experience or a communicative norms or orientation to time all things which are structured through our culture lives. Well there’s one complication here which is just a disciplinary psychology was finally beginning to embrace culture. Some of the academic disciple are devoted to studying culture namely anthropology had gone post-cultural. 

00:10:00
Clarifying the Question ■ Key Terms (cont) ■ Culture(cont) ■ Complication: Post-Cultural Anthropology ■ term culture promote essentialism ■ reinforces "otherness" Discreteness(instead of diffusion & overlap) Coherence (instead of diversity) Timelessness(instead of change) ■ Lesson Use the word carefully ■ Ise as adjective (e.g., cultural)rather than noun cultures (e.g., cultures) 

00:10:00
JOSEPH GONE For example, in her influential 1991 essay, anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod argued that it was time for scholars to "write against culture" in their work. Use of them term culture can’t help she argued but to promote essentialism and reinforced otherness. This is because particularly anthropology others had culture whereas anthropologist themselves were culture free and by implication. In some ways this gets to what Fredly Ong(ph) mentioned yesterday on the panel as the out group homogeneity effect that is Abu-Lughod argued the identification or description of cul…a culture freezes difference. Specifically she said the concept implies discreteness between cultures instead of diffusion and overlap coherence within cultures instead of diversity and timelessness of cultures instead of change. For example just taking my own people there are perhaps 4000 of us who identify or share with my ethnicity, not race which as American Indian but ethnicity A’aninan or Gros Ventre. But when we talk about Gros Ventre culture, we can’t help but suggest discreteness a marked Gros Ventre distinctiveness for example for co-resident Assiniboine or white people despite over a century of interaction and intermarriage . We talk about coherence a general uniformity and the Gros Ventre perspective, activity, and outlook despite rather terrific variations in these according to gender, generation, religious persuasion, education, occupation, etc. we invoke seemingly timelessness a reference in particular to a historically movement in our 19th-century buffalo-hunting way of life even though we were equestrians of that sort for only 150 years & have not lived like that for the past 120 years. So what is the lesson here? We should adopt the term culture with little bit more care and recurrently we do I think. And perhaps even consider restricting our use of the word especially in our published scholarship not so much in Colloquial usage to its form as an adjective rather than as a noun for example describing cultural processes or cultural practices, rather than "cultures" 

00:12:15
Clarifying the Question ■ Key Terms(cont) ■ What is science? involve the precise, observer-independent measurement of phenomena that are progressively/cumulatively employed to evaluate falsifiable theoretical explications of the phenomena 

00:12:15
JOSEPH GONE Time now to turn to our second key term, what is science? And you thought defining culture was tricky. Our problem in defining science is that it is difficult to generalize form paleontology to particle physics or from astronomy to sociology. In fact it’s unclear what common actives can be distilled out of the variety of recognized sciences. Philosophers of science have actually demonstrated that there is no method or set of procedures that are shared by all sciences or scientists. But for the purpose of this discussion science maybe understood to involve the precise, observer-independent measurement of phenomena that are progressively and cumulatively employed to evaluate falsifiable theoretical explications of the phenomena. By observer-independent I mean, simply that any competent specialist should be able to reproduce the observations, and that such observations are not dependent upon which specialist observes them. Scientific inquiry is premised on a distinctive synthesis of rationalism but promotes the adoptions of robust logic and argumentation. Empiricism that does prescribes systematic observation of the world and skepticism which expresses the concern that potentially personally compelling inferences can actually be erroneous. And we could add to this, Um… Anna Mari’s(ph) list from yesterday therefore the components of science, determinism, empiricism, parsimony and testability. 

00:13:40
•Distinctive synthesis of rationalism, empiricism, & skepticism • From Logical Positivism to Scientific Realism 

00:13:45
JOSEPH GONE The dominant philosophy of science for the first half of the 20th century was logical positivism or logical empiricism as developed by the Vienna Circle of philosophers beginning in the 1920s. The people like Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath, logical positivism promoted the view that truth statements about the world were meaningless unless they were specified in precise, empirically verifiable terms. Logical positive in synthesize precise technical language to observable test conditions attempted to eliminate of any surplus meaning as beyond what can be observed and in psychology the clearest expression of these ideas was B. F. Skinner‘s neo-behaviorism which denied even that he had a mind(ph). Although widely influential, logical positivism did not endure as a viable philosophy very long, there were multiple critiques that many of you are familiar with .Karl Popper for example showed that falsifiable instead of falsifiablility instead of verifiability was the proper criterion for philosophy of science. Hilary Putnam demonstrated that theory and observation are not truly distinct at all there are no fact object versus theory driven perspective or value distinctions to be made. Thomas Kuhn revealed that scientific progress was based more sociology than discovery. And the result was that logical positivism was recognizably defunct by the 1970s. In its place, most scientists today are scientific realists. In light of the above critiques among others, realists acknowledge that scientific truths are only approximations of the world, though in the most established instances they believe that these truths can be taken at face value as legitimate statements about the external world. 

00:15:20
• Complication • Consolidation of folk knowledge? • Indigenous “Science” vs. Western Science •Relational cosmology based on animism • Mechanical cosmology based on materialism •Distinctive Historical Product of the Western Enlightenment 

00:15:20
JOSEPH GONE Well another complication isn't science just a consolidation of folk knowledge, a cumulative body of observed regularities about the world passed down from generation to generation in all human societies. Lets take for example the case of indigenous science. I am frequently unclear whether discussions of indigenous science intend to distinguish between it and what we might refer to as Western science or Enlightenment science that specifically began to emerge in the 17th century. If there is not a distinction, then why qualify the science in question as indigenous as opposed to simply calling it science? If there is a distinction, then who has asked us to trace out some of the parameters of that distinction. From what I can tell, little that even remotely resembles the Enlightenment project we called science was to emerge in Native North America. This is not to deny that, in every human community since prehistory, careful observation of the world and advances born of trial and error have profoundly shaped human experience. For example in agriculture and animal husbandry; hunting, trapping, and gathering; oceanic navigation; astronomy and calendrics, etc. But what does seem to be distinctive about Enlightenment science is the technical adoption of scientific methods to understand and explain far-reaching phenomena in the world in terms of abstract theorizations grounded in strictly materialist assumptions for purposes of prediction and control. Note that I’m calling attention here then to abstract theorizations, materialist assumptions, and prediction and control in this characterization of Enlightenment science. With respect to these features, I am simply unaware of pre-contact Native peoples employing scientific methods of this sort. And I think there is a clear reason for this tracing a long line from the biblical Book of Genesis in which Yahweh gave (inaudible ) over nature. Enlightenment science assumes the progressive development of human mastery over the world and proceeds on the assumption that the world is properly understood and explained in materialist terms yielding the descriptions of the causal laws of nature, and so on. But American tell at least fro the native people with which I'm familiar most embraced a relational cosmology based on what we might call animism as opposed to a mechanistic cosmology based on materialism. In other world even when we studied the habits of game for the purpose of hunting, we still understand that these animals were persons, we had to be respected ritually and otherwise lest we offend them and suffer their future reluctance to give themselves to us for food and indeed, among some peoples, hunting was best constituted as the seduction of game by the hunter, an obvious interpersonal transaction. And so, science as a form of inquiry and knowledge production is a historical product of the seismic cultural shifts wrought by the Western Enlightenment. One final term that we want to consider before we answer this question is the wedding of two of our earlier terms letting me to ask: 

00:18:25
• What is psychological Science? Application of methods originally developed for the natural sciences to the study of mind and behavior •Realization of Comte's Positivism • Born of Modernity: From the religious of the naturalistic • Emphasized measurement, quantification, explanation in terms of causal laws 

00:18:25
JOSEPH GONE What is psychological science? Elucidation of this term is not nearly as intimidating as consideration of its constituents, but it nevertheless requires more complicated response than one might expect. The simple answer is that psychological science is the application of methods originally developed for the natural sciences to the study of what has came to be known as mind and behavior. In this sense, psychological science represents the realization of Comte‘s positivism of the mid-1800s that sought to bring human nature, human experience, and human affairs into the realm of natural science inquiry. Along with the other social sciences, psychology was born of modernity-it both shaped and was shaped by a dramatic societal shift in interest away from older religious notions like soul, virtue, and conduct toward novel naturalistic terms like mind, behavior, and personality. It drew on natural science practices such as measurement, quantification, and explanation with reference to causal laws. Although as a quick aside that has remembered to keep our terminology straight. The word empirical does not mean experimental or even scientific; rather refers to the practice of observing phenomena out in the world. Thus, interpretive inquiry say anthropological-style ethnography is just as empirical as more disciplinarily familiar variable-analytic inquiry. In addition to this the quantitative/qualitative dimension is logically independent of the experimental feel based dimension. For example some experimental results are interpreted absence the use of statistic. The need to clarify these terms and is reflective of another interesting aspect of psychological science. 

00:20:10
• Psychological Science (cont) • Preoccupation with method • Cronbach‘s 1957 Two Disciplines • Experimental Methods • Correlational Methods •Extremely Diverse Field of Inquiry 

00:20:15
JOSEPH GONE More so than most sciences, psychology is distinctive for its preoccupation with method. This is reflected in Cronbach‘s classic 1957 article on the two disciplines of scientific psychology. Cronbach‘s distinguish between experimental and Correlational research in psychology. What’s interesting as when you talk about the two disciples of scientific psychology you’re talking about content domains, he was talking about method. And these approaches reflect two early disciplinary legacies. The first was the legacy of laboratory studies of psychophysics, reaction times and perceptions from a early 19... 20th century. And the other legacy was field based studies of intelligence and child development, We'll trace one of those briefly in a second. Both traditions of course usually depend on statistical analysis of observations. Nevertheless, in contrast to conventional histories of our discipline, psychology has been an incredibly multifaceted field of inquiry from its very inception. As Roger Smith notes in his mammoth Norton History of the Human Sciences: "Psychology has no origin", its identity in the 20th century is fragmented and its roots are diverse . For example, Willhelm Wundt, usually credited with creating the first psychology laboratory, was dedicated to several distinct intellectual programs throughout his lifetime, including one experimental psychology, two, the nature of mental content , and three cultural psychology. that look lot more like anthropology or the humanities. It's interesting to note of course that he remained a philosopher until his death. He never identified as a psychologist. So, psychology today appears to be less unified as you know in its intellectual pursuits than ever before, that subdivided into numerous areas clinical psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology and interfacing with numerous other disciplines education, business, and medicine. Noteworthy, perhaps, is the fact the only graduate courses that nearly all psychologists are required to complete this statistics. We revisit this disciplinary heterogeneity later, but for now let's acknowledge that psychological science is the disciplinary project that applies what we have already reviewed as a scientific approach to the production of knowledge about the regularities of human mind and behavior. 

00:22:25
Answering the Question • Is psychological science a-cultural? •No •Consolidation into Practices, Products, & Institutions • Collective human activity cannot exist outside of culture • Impossible to be acultural in principle • But you already knew that… • something else in mind? 

00:22:30
JOSEPH GONE At last we come to the question this presentation was designed to address: Is psychological science acultural? I'm afraid that my answer to this question is rather anticlimactic, in part because I imagine that almost all of you knew the answer prior to walking into the door this morning. No, psychological science is not acultural. This is because, as a collective disciplinary endeavor, of any kind whose origins can be traced from the Western Enlightenment through a complex sequence of historical events that demonstrates that its consolidation over time into concrete practices such as statistical training concrete products such as journal articles, and concrete institutions such as academic departments. Indeed, because almost no collective human activity can exist outside of its constituting cultural context, it remains impossible in principle for psychological science to be acultural. There! We have come to it but like you I suspect that the conference organizers already knew that psychological science is not and cannot be acultural, thus they must have had something else in mind imposing this question for our shared consideration. And to this something else that I wish to devote the remainder of this presentation. 

00:23:40
Assessing Psychological Science Implicit Problem Benefits Limitations 

00:23:40
•Misgivings About Psychological Science •WEIRD people have been the norm •Human diversity was absent for too long •Difference is treated disparagingly •Attending to disadvantage is less valued •Qualitative methods have been dismissed 

00:23:40
JOSEPH GONE My sense is that positioning of this particular or (inaudible ) of this particular question was meant to be indirectly reflective of some deep misgivings about psychological science as it has unfolded over the past century. Specifically most of us at this conference are readily familiar with the following trends in the history of our field, knowledge about psychology has been introduced as if culturally WEIRD people who representative of humanity. Where WEIRD refers to samples from Western Educated Industrialized Rich and Democratic society. This is Henrich, Heine and Norenzayan 2010 characterization. Culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class and other domains of human diversity have been curiously absent from the psychological record for too much of it’s history. When these differences have been addressed, this has been done in a manner that frequently denigrates or disparages already marginalized populations, research that attended the historical and political disadvantages of psychological difference is less likely to be valued through publication, funding or honors. Interpretive or qualitative methods used to foster rich understandings of psychological experience the difference have been dismissed as inappropriate for disciplinary enquiry. Familiarity with these trends in our discipline lead Robert Guthrie to lament in 1978 that in reference to behavioral psychology even the rat was white. Perhaps the most acridness sense of disciplinary fall along these lines is illustrated by select moments on the long history of intelligent testing by psychologists. 

00:25:10
•The Demoralizing Case of Intelligence Testing •Francis Galton in England •Individual Differences due to Heredity over Environment •Distribution of Variation within a Population •Station Ability ?Eugenics •Binet & Simon in France •Terman & Yerkes in US •Mental Testing ? Birth of psychological expertise 

00:25:10
JOSEPH GONE Roger Smith historian again has traced the roots of intelligence, testing to the innovative work of Francis Galton in the mid 1800s. Galton brought together unwavering belief in the dominant influence of heredity over environment. With the novel idea, the inheritance of individual attributes could be studied through analysis of the distribution of variation within a population so it’s really a novel idea at the time. His research reported that demonstrated that upper class elites occupied their privilege stations throughout Great Britain because they possessed higher abilities. On a grounds of this basic research he proposed concrete applications, basically eugenics. By the turn of the century Binet and Simon in France were figuring out how to identify “Mental sub-normals" in state funded education systems. And with further development in the United States by Lewis Terman and Robert Yerkes it was soon the case that the new psychology was assessing the intelligence of 1.75 million conscripts from World War I. Incidentally they found the average mental age of the World War I conscript to be about age 13. In short the establishments of psychology as distinctive expertise depended heavily on the mental testing movement. Getting to my point, because of the hereditary and ethos of the age, the results of intelligence testing during this period were interpreted mean that men were innately smarter than women, whites were innately smarter than non-whites and American born whites were innately smarter than immigrant whites. 

00:26:40
The Implicit Problem Intelligence Testing(cont) •Intelligence interpreted though hereditarian lens •Men innately smarter than women •Whites innately smarter than non-whites •American whites innately smarter than immigrant whites. •Later Shift in cultural mores…•…then back again • Jensen (1969) in Harvard Educational Review • Hernnstein & Murray’s (1994)The Bell Curve 

00:26:40
JOSEPH GONE It's important to note here Supporting note here that there were detractors even in the early days and that cultural more subsequently shifted after World War I owing in part to developments in cultural anthropology, to a greater emphasis on the environmental determinants of ability, but as you likely well know these alarming assertions about innate differences in intelligences have resurfaced from time to time, first in 1969 with Arthur Jensen's controversial paper on race and IQ in Havard Educational Review and yet again in 1994 with publication of Richard Hernnstein and Charles Murray’s The Bell Curve 

00:27:10
•Historical Lessons. •Psychological science •emerges at particular historical moments •achieves particular goals •motivated by particular interests •Tied to ideologically suspect agendas that psychologists are right to repudiate 

00:27:15
JOSEPH GONE Through this and myriad of other historical lessons we can see that psychological science emerges at particular historical moments, to achieve particular goals that were motivated by particular interests. Throughout too much of history of psychological science these goals and interests were tied to ideological suspect agendas that contemporary psychologists are right to repudiate. All of this can lead present days psychologist to wonder. 

00:27:40
•Questions: •Is there something inherent to psychological science that predisposes disciplinary inquiry toward prejudicial conclusions? •Is the conduct of psychological science intrinsically contaminated by the oppressive ideologies that arose with our discipline? •Can psychology’s knowledge practices be disentangled from ideological contamination to furnish viable methods? 

00:27:45
JOSEPH GONE Is there something inherent to psychological science that predisposes disciplinary inquiry toward ethnocentric, racist, classes, misogynist and heteronormative conclusions? To refine the question a bit further is the conduct of psychological science intrinsically contaminated by the oppressive ideologies that arose hand-in-hand with our discipline just as the sciences more generally arose in the context of European empire and western colonization? Or to reframe the question more positively: Can psychology’s knowledge practices ever be disentangled from its earlier ideological contamination to furnish the discipline with viable methods? In short, what ultimately is the promise of psychological science? I prepared to offer you my answer to this question, before doing so I have to confess that my thinking on this issues remains under development. Moreover I have a hunch that a truly sophisticated and definitive answer will emerge from much greater familiarity with philosophy of science that I currently possess. 

00:28:45
Benefits of Psychological Science • Yes, psychology can be disentangled from its history of ideological contamination • Modernist elaboration of universal processes •Extension of human rationality • Multicultural adoption • Scientific knowing • Provides a cognitive prosthesis • Supplements conceptual toolkit 

00:28:45
JOSEPH GONE Nevertheless I propose that psychological science much like science more generally can in fact be disentangled from its history of ideological contamination to furnish viable methods to address at least some important questions that psychologists aspire to answer. But how could science escape it’s own contaminated history, whereas before I emphasized the discontinuity of science with folk knowledge I want to respond here by accentuating the continuity of science with such knowledge. Specifically, I propose that scientific knowing represents a modernist elaboration of universal epistemological processes. As we have already reviewed its difficult to conceal any human society that did without some form of empiricism, observing the world in order to draw conclusions about predictable regularities, engaging in trail and error learning etc. In this regard scientific knowing is partly an extension of these fundamental principals to problems of greater complexity and nuance to better overcome the limitations of human rationality. As a set of inferential tools as appose to a totalizing ideology scientific methods are exceedingly useful and harbored great potential contribute to the common good as indeed they have in so many domains of life. Importantly it is not that these epistemological traditions have somehow transcended culture to become acultural rather it is that their evident benefits have led to their widespread adoption across multicultural contexts. In this sense, science itself have become multicultural. In sum, I characterize the main contribution of scientific knowing as the extension of rationality into the domains, otherwise beyond the limits of human reason, limits that psychology itself has helped to chart. Certainly in modern life there are plentiful instances which would be helpful to know things of this sort that seems to me that even the aspiration for prediction and control, can be harnessed to a wide range of interests and agendas including progressive and emancipatory ones as Anna Marie(ph) said yesterday. Thus scientific knowing can be taken up as a cognitive prosthesis of swords, that is as a set of inferential practices for driving certain forms of knowledge, facility with scientific knowing is just another implement in the conceptual tool box. 

00:31:15
Benefits of Psychological Science • Return to Question of American Indian Behavioral Health Interventions • Skepticism about local knowledge claims •The difficulty of casual inference • Absence of evaluation of routine claims •Applicability of scientific evaluation •Experimental procedures & causal inference 

00:31:15
JOSEPH GONE And so to return to the issue of American Indian behavioral health interventions that I raised earlier, two points come into mind, first on the basis of psychological science I am skeptical of routine claims by American Indian behavioral health advocates that “We already know what works in our community.” As an argument for dismissing empirically supported interventions for example motivational interviewing for treating substance abuse in favor of culturally local interventions that have never been systematically evaluated for example sweat lodge ceremonies for treating substance abuse. There are two reason for my skepticism, the first is that causal inferences are a notoriously difficult to draw off the tops of our heads in the realm of psychosocial intervention and all psychologist learn about this in our training. The second is that routine claims of this sort permeates social life, and the absence of systematic evaluation it is not always possible to determine which are accurate and which are erroneous. Please not that this position is not the same, as denying that sweat lodge participation is effective for ameliorating American Indian substance abuse. In fact I would not be at all surprised if the sweat lodge proved to be efficacious in treating substance abuse problems for many American Indians. Furthermore I can posit a rationale or a causal model for why the sweat lodge might in fact be therapeutic in this way. Moreover I believe desirable to demonstrate if possible that the sweat lodge is an efficacious intervention for Indian substance abuse but for now in the absence of any systematic outcome evidence I do not know and cannot accept on faith that such claims warrant professional confidence. Second having said this on the basis of psychological science I believe it possible and principle to evaluate many such claims by using range of scientific methods to discriminate between the possibility of competing causal explanations. That is I believe that the experimental method employed by psychologists characterized by random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups with an eye towards assessing differential outcomes, is the best tool that humanity possess to afford reliable casual inference under conditions akin to psychosocial intervention but it is crucial to note that my faith in this model, does not constrain the kinds of interventions that I might in principle evaluate in this way. Whether motivational interviewing or sweat lodge ceremonies, for example I think there are persuasive reason my many American Indians reject mainstream behavior health interventions in desire to adopt culturally local approaches for managing debilitating distress. I thus hope one day to be able to evaluate specific indigenous cultural practices that may resemble nothing like psychotherapy in terms of their therapeutic approach. My point is that there is nothing intrinsic to science or psychological science that restricts me from engaging in these pro-native evaluations and yesterday Doug McDonald(ph) on the panel talked about possibly doing an valuation of equine-assisted psychotherapy with American Indian youth and that’s the kind of the thing that I think these methods could well assist with, in some psychological science equips us with methodological tools to apply to as wider range of questions and as wider range of contexts as we deem useful, none of this is to naïvely claim however that psychological science is the royal road to truth. In fact the limitations of psychological science can be formidable and in my opinion warrant a remarkable degree of humility. Thus, it is the limitations of psychological science that I now turn briefly to the final portion of my presentation.

Limitations of Scientific Psychology • Numerous reasons for maintaining vigilance • Psychological science (PS) works better in theory than in practice 1. PS is never adopted or deployed outside of particular interests, objectives, & motivations • Requires ongoing critical engagement with the overt and covert agendas • Most of you already do this! 

00:35:05
JOSEPH GONE The preceding must make me out to be not just scientific but rather scientist and yet, those who know me, all my work know this is far from true, in fact there are numerous reasons for maintaining critical vigilance when it comes to the claims of psychological science, most of these stem from the fact that psychological science like science more generally works better in theory than in practice and its findings had to be assessed in light of the actual routine of scientific conduct, Regrettably, there is only time to date briefly canvas four such limitations. As I have already reviewed psychological science has never adopted to deploy outside of culturally constituted interests objects and motivations, there by requiring ongoing critical engagement with the overt and covert agendas served by its findings, when it comes to matters of human difference I know that many of you here at this conference remain at the forefront of this kind of critical engagement. 

00:36:00
2. Biases inherent to scientific practices favor the finding of positive results that are erroneous (Loanddidis, 2005a, 2005b) • “Most Published Research Findings are False” • Many results from highly-cited health intervention studies do not hold upon replication •44% of findings were replicated 

00:36:00
JOSEPH GONE Second the biases inherent to scientific practice favor the finding and publishing of positive and specially ground breaking results that in a surprising of cases can be shown to be erroneous. Consider the currently celebrated work of John Loannidis mainly with reference to the health science, Loannidis has published a series of very high impact analyses during the past several years that demonstrate that “Most published research findings are false” Owning to biases that are built in to the research endeavor and the way he works through this both at the theoretical and empirical level are quite interesting. He is also demonstrated that “Even highly cited positive health intervention outcomes, mostly obtained from randomized clinical trials are not replicated”. Specifically among 45 of the most highly cited health intervention research studies from the 1990s only 44% less than half held upon subsequent replication, 16% were in fact contradiction, contradicted upon replication, 16% evidenced reduced effects upon replication and 24% had never actually been replicated in the subsequent years. 

00:37:10
PS depends on faith in its methods for confidence in its findings, but watch out when findings extend beyond preconceptions •The Case of Parapsychology • Bem & Honorton (1994) in Psychological Bulletin • Bem (in press) in JPSP •Almost no psychologists accept these findings • Insularity of scientific orthodoxy • Circularity of scientific reasoning 

00:37:15
JOSEPH GONE Third Psychological science depends on faith in its methods for confidence in its findings, but when findings extend too far beyond preconceived notions of truth, psychologist will dismiss such findings on the presumption of faulty methods and declare such work as beyond the bounds of disciplinary inquiry. For just this reason Roger Smith in his History of Human Sciences devotes a section the emergence of Parapsychology. Recent compelling instances include Bem and Honorton 1994 Psychological Bulletin article Does I Exists which reviewed 11 studies employing the rigorous autoganzfeld experimental technique, to provide evidence and support of ESP. Deryl Bem is currently in press article which you may have seen on in the news from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology which summarizes positive results from eight studies in support of precognition and premonition. Of course almost no psychological scientists accept these findings as evidence of ESP. And this illustrates the insularity of scientific orthodoxy as well as circularity of scientific reasoning beyond expectations, results and interpretations. 

00:38:25
4. Ongoing debate about whether human psychology is properly knowable by natural science methods • Obviously such methods can be applied… …but what really do we learn? • Explanation vs Understanding • Former thru measurement, control, & quantification • Latter thru description, meaning, & interpretation • Alternative paradigms of psychological inquiry 

00:38:30
JOSEPH GONE Fourth throughout the history of psychological science there has been ongoing debate about whether human mind and behavior are truly or properly knowable by methods borrowed from the natural sciences, the positivist project. The critique is obviously not that natural science methods are unable to applied to psychology we see this all the time but rather that when we do what we learn is ultimately sterile and impoverished, am I ask you what standing causal laws of behavior have psychologists really identified during the past century, or to loosen the criteria bit, what general psychological findings from over a century of inquiry can you bring to mind as exemplars of cumulative psychological knowledge. One time honored way of opposing inquiry in the natural human sciences is to contrast the difference and goals between them, as explanation, on the one hand or understanding on the other. By revisiting the incredible diversity that characterize psychology since its emergence at the end of 19th century. Its easy to see that both projects have been in effect. For example quite a few psychologists seek an explanation of the causal origins of distinctive forms of psychopathology well some though relatively few psychologists pursue an understanding of cultural meaning such conditions instantiate in peoples live during particular historical moments. Despite evidence of both kinds of projects remains indisputable that the natural sciences quest for psychological explanation based on measurement, control and quantification, has totally dominated the human science quest for psychological understanding based on description meaning and interpretation. In fact there seem to be striking ways in which psychology scientific aspirations hobble disciplinary inquiry into the human condition that has motivated some psychologists to consider alternative paradigms for inquiry such alternatives include among a wide range of others, phenomenological psychology, hermeneutic psychology, discursive psychology, dialogical psychology, construction psychology and indeed multicultural psychology. Some of these might be classed as what Anna Marie(ph) labeled as post modern psychology yesterday. Interesting more recently several of us have been classified together under the label consultative socio-cultural psychology by Kirschner & Martin in opposition to the old cross-cultural psychology and the current experimental cultural psychology and indeed some form of constitute socio-cultural sociology with which I identify more strongly. And so even in retaining some faith in the methods of psychological sciences to address certain kinds of questions that remains plentifully for justification for undertaking psychological inquiry beyond the limited bounds of measurement control and quantifications. In sum, despite the advantages of scientific inquiry for addressing certain kinds of causal questions I believe that our discipline would benefit from greater support for a robust methodological pluralism far from worry and too much the multicultural psychology has strayed from science I would simply like to see smart and rigorous scholarship in multicultural psychology regardless of the methods used. 

00:41:45
Conclusion • In this presentation I have endeavored to: • Complicate our understanding of key terms • Argue that psychological science is not & cannot be acultural • Offer a rationale for the relevance of psychological science • Identify key limitations of psychological science that support alternative approaches 

00:41:45
JOSEPH GONE In this presentation I endeavor to complicate our understanding of terms which is such as culture, science and psychological science, for example science is not a unitary concept with defining methods or common procedures. To argue that psychological science is not and cannot in principle become acultural for example there is no meaning for human activity that occurs outside of culture such as science, to offer rational for the relevance of scientific inquiry for multicultural psychology. For example controlled experiments maybe the best epistemic tools humans now possess to infer certain kinds of casual relationships. And finally to identify key limitations of scientific enquiry that support alternative approaches for multicultural psychology for example the cultivation of better understanding of the meanings of the psychopathology. I very much appreciate your kind attention this morning as early as it was in particular and I look forward to subsequent conversation about this throughout the day. Thank you.
