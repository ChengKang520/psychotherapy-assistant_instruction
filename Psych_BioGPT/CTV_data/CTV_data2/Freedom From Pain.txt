Maggie Phillips, PhD 

00:00:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Earlier today, Michelle is where uh… we met in my workshop that long ago, I was talking about polyvagal system and pain and having uh… having port with ventral vagal connection is the "We-ness" of the relationship, right? 

00:00:50
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:00:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And I hope that resonated with you. 

00:00:55
MICHELLE Yes, it did. 

00:01:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS But now we have a slightly different topic. It's not that different but your thought and fear about different, very simple strategies we can use to work with pain effectively. And some of those are bleeding, and working with page on rhythms which uh… I didn't get to in the workshop so we might work with those here. That's depending on what's going on with you. And anything else that we think might help you? Ain't they? 

00:01:30
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:01:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So why don't you tell us why you approached me earlier and how we ended up… up here? 

00:01:45
MICHELLE I have been working on shoulder pain for a long time, so like I came up after the uh… workshop to ask for a referral and umm… that's not how that went. So… 

00:02:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, I will give you the photo also. 

00:02:00
MICHELLE I think I'll be fine. 

00:02:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I hope so. Which shoulder? 

00:02:05
MICHELLE It's my right shoulder. 

00:02:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:02:10
MICHELLE And also uh… it's in the middle of my back. So like it's… but it's… Yeah. 

00:02:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Your thoracic back? 

00:02:15
MICHELLE Mm-hmm. 

00:02:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. Uh… Scapula and all, is that affected? 

00:02:20
MICHELLE Scapula is the shoulder… 

00:02:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Shoulder blade. 

00:02:25
MICHELLE Yeah. I… I have a total uh… well a reconstruction. I must have dislocated my right shoulder regularly for about 20 years and finally then they had to tighten up all the tendons, and umm… I have a uh… second socket in that right shoulder 

00:02:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Wow. 

00:02:45
MICHELLE From it, just dislocating constantly for many years. 

00:02:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So lot has happened? 

00:02:50
MICHELLE Lot has happened. 

00:02:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS How long ago was the procedure that you had? 

00:02:55
MICHELLE Umm… I think six years ago or… 

00:02:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Six or seven? 

00:02:55
MICHELLE No, eight. 

00:02:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Eight. 

00:03:00
MICHELLE I'm sorry, eight. Yes. 

00:03:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And how did you respond to that? What was… what was the pain like or your function in that shoulder after you had the medical procedure? 

00:03:10
MICHELLE Umm… I was very grateful that I was stable, because the constant dislocation was kind of uh… again I got really used to relocating my own shoulder. 

00:03:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Wow. 

00:03:25
MICHELLE You know umm… but so I was grateful for this stability, and but I still have apprehension in my shoulder, periodically. Umm… recently, it's been hurting again and that makes me umm… concerned. Although, I have had good… I have had uh… physical therapies, so I know it's probably just muscular other than anything. 

00:03:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh-huh. You think it's muscular? 

00:03:50
MICHELLE Like yeah, and I also have umm… degenerated discs, so. 

00:03:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Gotcha. 

00:03:55
MICHELLE Yeah, so… 

00:03:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Where? Which discs? 

00:04:00
MICHELLE I wanna say T4, 5, and 6. Right, in that same area and then I also have some in my lumbar spine that kind of affect. 

00:04:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And your lumbar spine. 

00:04:10
MICHELLE Yeah, correct. 

00:04:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Anything else I need to know in order to help you? 

00:04:20
MICHELLE Umm… no, although, I have never done this before something really very nervous. 

00:04:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:04:20
MICHELLE So is there anything… 

00:04:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And not to look. 

00:04:25
MICHELLE Yeah, well. 

00:04:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh… maybe that would be a strategy. I'm not sure. How is it if you just look at me? 

00:04:30
MICHELLE Good. Fine. I'm okay with that. 

00:04:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS All right, good. Uh… that's a good place to start, right? 

00:04:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:04:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And it's okay if you would stay focused here. 

00:04:40
MICHELLE Okay, good. 

00:04:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, good. Permission is always a good thing, isn't it? 

00:04:50
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:04:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. So what do you hope for this work with me today? 

00:05:00
MICHELLE Umm… I hope to have a better understanding about why my shoulder does what it does. And I hope to have better umm… I have a lot of pain management techniques, but I wish I would have one that would make me feel free. I don't know if that's possible. 

00:05:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I don't either, but you know, what I think it's always a good idea to wish for being pain free. 

00:05:25
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:05:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Why settle for less if you don't have to. Yes. 

00:05:30
MICHELLE I would like that. 

00:05:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. Umm… How did all of this start? There's always struck by you're saying when the better understanding of what your shoulder does. 

00:05:45
MICHELLE I remember uh… first dislocation probably it started happening when I was in college. 

00:05:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:05:55
MICHELLE You know, I'm an active person and do all adventurous things and so I think I had a lot of injury to my right shoulder and I'm right handed umm… that's my dominant thing. 

00:06:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, so when you make that kinda movement, what do you feel in your shoulder and elsewhere? 

00:06:15
MICHELLE When just did now. 

00:06:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Just the grab, and try to grab something. Does that feel like? And do it a little slower. 

00:06:30
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:06:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS If you want to. 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What did you find? 

00:06:50
MICHELLE Unworthy. 

00:06:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You sound, a feeling of being unworthy? 

00:06:55
MICHELLE No. 

00:07:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, was out of surprise. 

00:07:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:07:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, let's pause and really stay with that for little bit. 

00:07:10
MICHELLE Don't like it. 

00:07:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What did you say? 

00:07:15
MICHELLE I don't like it. 

00:07:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You don't like it. Yeah, I don't like it. I think that's a healthy sign, not to like the feeling of being unworthy. 

00:07:25
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:07:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. Okay, how you're feeling in your body in here with that big surprise that came up? 

00:07:35
MICHELLE Looked hot. 

00:07:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Hot? 

00:07:40
MICHELLE Yeah, hot. Yeah. 

00:07:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I'm gonna move closer to your arm. I'm sorry about this with the camera, but client comes first in my opinion. I'm gonna hold this for you. 

00:07:50
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:07:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. Now, let's see how that works. So is worth okay? 

00:07:55
MICHELLE No. 

00:07:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS No? 

00:07:55
MICHELLE Yeah, little, it feels… 

00:07:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It feels like right in your face. 

00:08:00
MICHELLE Like, this was pointing at me now. 

00:08:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. Can you uh… move this way a little bit? See, no. Turn around this way. There you go. Now, I'll see how that goes. 

00:08:10
MICHELLE No. 

00:08:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You wanna hold it? 

00:08:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:08:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:08:10
MICHELLE So, then I feel like, at least, it's you pointing at me and not you pointing at me. 

00:08:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Fair enough. I certainly don't wanna point at you in any… anyway. Okay. Especially, right now, right? 

00:08:25
MICHELLE Right? 

00:08:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Right. 

00:08:30
MICHELLE Right. 

00:08:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. So, you were talking about how this was feeling to you? 

00:08:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:08:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS 'Cause, you know, you have your body. So anything more you wanna say about it? 

00:08:45
MICHELLE Umm… no. 'Cause it will go waste. 

00:08:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You said hot and breathless. 

00:08:50
MICHELLE Yeah. Like found out. 

00:08:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh… 

00:08:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:08:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. Exposed. 

00:08:55
MICHELLE Exposed. 

00:08:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Exposed, yeah. I bet it does, but like that. 

00:09:00
MICHELLE Yeah. Feels like that. 

00:09:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:09:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Now, is it okay if I talk about the un-worth of the uh… worthless feeling? And we're clear that we're not in anyway suggesting that you are worthless or unworthy. We're talking about the feeling of that, right, that came off. Right? And so, it's okay to talk about? 

00:09:25
MICHELLE I think it's important. 

00:09:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I get you, but I'm glad you feel safe enough to talk about it. 

00:09:35
MICHELLE You know, my stomach is saying something else. 

00:09:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, well, what did your stomach saying? 

00:09:40
MICHELLE It's look, you know, I don't wanna talk about that. 

00:09:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I though wanna talk about that. 

00:09:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:09:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, all right. So seems like most of you is okay to talk about this, and feels it's important and there is one part of you and your stomach, that says uh-huh. 

00:10:00
MICHELLE Right. 

00:10:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Right. So let's find some help for your stomach first. Okay. And let's just ask if there is any other part of you inside that could help this feeling that your stomach is having right now? And just wait and see what comes to you, because I don't know any answer. And you may not even… 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Let's… what you finding so far? 

00:10:40
MICHELLE Poster, my poster. 

00:10:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Your poster. 

00:10:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:10:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What about your poster? 

00:10:50
MICHELLE One of my uh… my physical therapist said if I hold my shoulder forward not this side back, I feel better. 

00:10:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh-huh. 

00:11:00
MICHELLE I do. 

00:11:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You do? 

00:11:00
MICHELLE I do. 

00:11:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. So can you even exaggerate that a little bit and let's see how your stomach feels. 

00:11:10
MICHELLE No. Those up on my throat. 

00:11:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Whoa! Get it. So that's… maybe it's good in terms of your physical therapy, but for our purposes here, that's not gonna do it. Yeah. 

00:11:25
MICHELLE Myself, my breath. 

00:11:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. Sounds like a very promising. 

00:11:30
MICHELLE Right. 

00:11:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Possibility. What about your breath, we'll help with it. 

00:11:35
MICHELLE Well, deeper breath. 

00:11:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Deeper breath? 

00:11:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:11:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And so, there you go. That's a nice deep breath. How does that feel? Down, here in your stomach. 

00:11:50
MICHELLE Feels better. 

00:11:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Feels better, okay. So you know them that, that something you can, as a place you can. 

00:11:55
MICHELLE Right. 

00:11:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Whatever you start to feel, that very uncomfortable feeling, right? 

00:12:00
MICHELLE Right. 

00:12:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And, I, is it okay if I remind you? 

00:12:05
MICHELLE Yes. Yes, please. 

00:12:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Sure. All right. We'll do this together. Right? 

00:12:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:12:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Right. So this feeling and we'll test it out with this next word of unworthiness. Let's see how your stomach's doing and 10 minutes like thrift. How is that? Can I continue my sentence to then? 

00:12:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:12:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, and if you could just move your microphone up, just lightly towards the mouth. 

00:12:45
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:12:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Anytime you want me to hold it, I… I know about the pointing thing, we'll figure something else at it, out, okay? 

00:12:50
MICHELLE Right. 

00:12:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Now, so this feeling of unworthiness that came up, what do you know about that back in college, when you starting having these two dislocations. 

00:13:10
MICHELLE Umm… I think that started earlier. 

00:13:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You think it started earlier than that? 

00:13:15
MICHELLE Feeling of that to let with go. But umm… how it related to college verse just me, completely confused, that'll go on from umm… one environment that cause to me feel pretty unworthy umm… to different environment that previously so different, very, very different. 

00:13:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It was, wasn't it? 

00:13:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:13:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So it must have been confusing? 

00:13:45
MICHELLE So lot of the staff. 

00:13:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS All right, so that maybe in the next somewhere, but what do you think was even earlier? You seem to have a some thought about that. 

00:14:00
MICHELLE No, he not be even when you asked if I would do this, which was my mom signing, don't draw attention to yourself. 

00:14:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh. 

00:14:10
MICHELLE Yeah, and then, we've asked even if… oh, that came up? Yeah. Yeah. 

00:14:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And how or does it seem connected to your shoulder? 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And you remember the first dislocation? 

00:14:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:14:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Under the age of 10? Do you think you can guess? 

00:14:50
MICHELLE Like, it's been going on and it was going on for so long, I couldn't even take, but I think it was probably when I was pointing something or looking for, you know, I spend it, to get somewhere. 

00:15:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You're only trying to get somewhere. 

00:15:10
MICHELLE Right. 

00:15:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, what happens when you say that? Trying to get somewhere? 

00:15:20
MICHELLE Well, I know it's trying to get somewhere, but, you know, sometimes it… I get… it's like I'm not supposed to be getting somewhere. 

00:15:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Ah, that goes back to don't drawn attention to yourself? 

00:15:30
MICHELLE Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:15:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:15:30
MICHELLE Right. 

00:15:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So, the sense, go ahead, bent it. 

00:15:40
MICHELLE And I think some side, very crime wall working on saying, let me stay in calm, for quite have been, for at least a year now. 

00:15:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:15:50
MICHELLE Made me my shoulders just, fighting me or something, like that. Right, that's what I thought. 

00:16:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh… because it wants to keep climbing, going somewhere? 

00:16:05
MICHELLE Maybe. 

00:16:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Maybe? 

00:16:10
MICHELLE And umm… and this sounds so weird, but I'm gonna put it out there. 

00:16:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Put it out there. 

00:16:15
MICHELLE Okay, my… my daughter injured her right hand. Now what I think about it, and since she injured her right hand, I wonder, I maybe… I get… I think sympathetic, I don't know, like… 

00:16:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You might be feeling sympathetic towards her? 

00:16:35
MICHELLE I might be. I've been, well, I am sympathetic towards her, let's put it that way. And I'm mad… I'm mad at her doctor too. So I mean, god, this isn't… this pulling all kinds of places I don't wanted to go. 

00:16:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm gonna… okay, so what's feeling uncomfortable to you? 

00:16:55
MICHELLE It's umm… exposure. 

00:16:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS More, that exposure. 

00:17:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:17:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Don't call attention to yourself, right? 

00:17:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:17:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. Now uh… I know it's hard. 

00:17:05
MICHELLE It really is hard. 

00:17:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I know it's… yeah, yeah. And it's easier to just call attention yourself with me. 

00:17:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, and feel any difference that makes, you shift your position a little bit. 

00:17:25
MICHELLE Yeah, better. 

00:17:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Better, okay, good, all right. And how about a nice deep breath? Just to make sure, your stomach is feeling connected to what we're doing here. 

00:17:50
MICHELLE My stomach is good. 

00:17:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Feels okay, great. Okay, you're doing very well if all of this. It is a lot, you're right. 

00:18:00
MICHELLE Mm-hmm. 

00:18:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS How about if we take one piece of it though? 

00:18:00
MICHELLE Mm-hmm. 

00:18:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You know what piece that would be? Okay, of all of things you said so far, which one of those are you curious about? 

00:18:15
MICHELLE Yeah, I think the one that touches the emotional chord more than any… I think it's this… this daughter thing. 

00:18:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS The daughter thing, okay. 

00:18:30
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:18:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What do you know about that? 

00:18:35
MICHELLE Umm… I love my daughter and I think, oh boy, it will… this girl could think… 

00:18:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Is it… is it okay if you feel love about your daughter? 

00:18:50
MICHELLE Yeah, it is. 

00:18:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, cause that I mean, that's going become up. 

00:18:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:18:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It already is, right? 

00:18:55
MICHELLE I think it's the… with my daughter and umm… I've taken really good care of her. 

00:19:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS How old is she? 

00:19:05
MICHELLE And she's… she's 18, she's finishing her high school. 

00:19:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS 18. Wow. 

00:19:15
MICHELLE And umm… I gave her, you know, encouraged her to go do something that was adventurous. She wants to do it, and she injured her hand, but she umm… yeah, and but she didn't injure it, we, but took… I took her to a doctor umm… the doctor did surgery on it. It's on MRI, that it was umm… broke… a broken ligament and it wasn't and I feel guilty. I think that's… that's a big part of our mission. It's… I'm just listening. 

00:19:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, who's the… who's, who made the mistake here? 

00:20:00
MICHELLE I feel responsible. 

00:20:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I know that, but I'm asking you who made the mistake. 

00:20:00
MICHELLE The doctor. 

00:20:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It sounds like it. 

00:20:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:20:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS To me, you saw the MRI? 

00:20:05
MICHELLE Umm… 

00:20:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Maybe you… 

00:20:10
MICHELLE I didn't see the MRI. 

00:20:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Hmm. Okay. 

00:20:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:20:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Could, if she…. she was under the age of 18 when it happened? 

00:20:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:20:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Should've seen the MRI. 

00:20:20
MICHELLE I know. I felt guilty. 

00:20:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, all right. Well, somebody didn't follow through. 

00:20:25
MICHELLE But I saw the report, and the MRI. 

00:20:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Mm-hmm. 

00:20:25
MICHELLE And there… all arise said it was totally broken. It was totally torn. 

00:20:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Torn? 

00:20:30
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:20:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Not broken? 

00:20:35
MICHELLE Umm… torn. 

00:20:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Torn. 

00:20:35
MICHELLE Absolutely torn in that, the ligament was in the… there was spinal injuries and the ligament is stuck between the joints. 

00:20:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:20:40
MICHELLE So I felt like I had done my best job. 

00:20:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Mm-hmm, that certainly sounded like, you know, that something that you didn't prepare. 

00:20:50
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:20:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS No way around it. 

00:20:50
MICHELLE And I took her to the best doctor, but I thought… 

00:20:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Good. I believe you did. 

00:20:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:21:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Umm… because there's more to the connection between you and your daughter than just luck which is very strong. I could feel that up here. 

00:21:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:21:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS All right. So there's something about, you being adventures and climbing, to get somewhere and you encouraging your daughter to be adventurous. Maybe, and maybe it wasn't about getting somewhere but… 

00:21:25
MICHELLE Exploring herself. 

00:21:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Exploring herself. Yeah, is there anything wrong with that? 

00:21:30
MICHELLE I think, it's cause I feel like, I had a different of that and this is limiting, this is threatening. 

00:21:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Aha. Okay. 

00:21:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:21:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So your intention was really good, maybe sure of intention. And the outcome was very, very hard and unexpected. 

00:21:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:22:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Quite shock? 

00:22:00
MICHELLE Yeah, cause I'm very careful with her. 

00:22:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, I bet you're careful with her. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What are you thinking? 

00:22:15
MICHELLE I'm just thinking, this generation of generation of mothers, like keep trying to do good, and we just keep… no, I guess not being perfect, you know? 

00:22:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, that is so painful. 

00:22:35
MICHELLE Yeah. My shoulders aren't hurting. 

00:22:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Your shoulder is not hurting, which is weird. It's not hurting now? 

00:22:40
MICHELLE No. 

00:22:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What is it when you said weird? I mean… 

00:22:45
MICHELLE I just wonder uh… I know that something… It's just feels like a relief on my shoulder. 

00:22:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Feels like a relief? All right, let's get this straight. What feels like a relief to your shoulder? 

00:23:05
MICHELLE To talk about this, feels like a relief. 

00:23:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Feels like a relief? Good. 

00:23:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:23:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:23:10
MICHELLE That's weird. Now, I feel embarrassed again. 

00:23:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Meaning you don't want to feel relief? 

00:23:15
MICHELLE No, I wanna feel relief. I just don't wanna be embarrassed. 

00:23:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, I'm glad we got that straight. 

00:23:20
MICHELLE Cause, I'm shy. 

00:23:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Let me get this straight. You wanna feel relieved? 

00:23:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:23:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And you do feel relieved? 

00:23:30
MICHELLE I feel relieved. I do have problems, but I feel relieved, right? 

00:23:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, yeah, cause we're really concerned about this one, that take your work, problem, right on shoulder. It seems to be expressing and it was relief. 

00:23:45
MICHELLE Right. So something helped it. 

00:23:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:23:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What was that? 

00:23:45
MICHELLE I think connecting. 

00:23:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:23:50
MICHELLE I think connecting. 

00:23:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Connecting helped. 

00:23:55
MICHELLE I think connecting of problem I don't want to know, which is, is been enough failure. 

00:24:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. Not being perfect? 

00:24:05
MICHELLE Not being, I couldn't help them up. 

00:24:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh. 

00:24:10
MICHELLE Yeah, but, I couldn't prevent an injury. 

00:24:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I know. 

00:24:15
MICHELLE And here, all this time, I think I had been kind of thinking like well, I got injury because I didn't have enough care, right? But here, I take a really good care of my daughter and she still gets in here, you know? It's just one of those feelings like… 

00:24:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I know you're angry about that. You're kinda hitting yourself here. 

00:24:35
MICHELLE I am. I feel like it's futile. 

00:24:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What's futile? 

00:24:35
MICHELLE It's just… 

00:24:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Trying to help your daughter? 

00:24:40
MICHELLE That you can't prevent children from getting out. 

00:24:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You can't. 

00:24:45
MICHELLE I know. 

00:24:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's the truth. 

00:24:50
MICHELLE Yeah. And it's hard. 

00:24:50
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:24:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Because we like to believe that we can't protect them, prevent the people we love from getting hurt, right? 

00:25:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. So how do you feel, when you say that? 

00:25:10
MICHELLE Now, I got a pain in the neck. 

00:25:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, a pain in the neck? 

00:25:10
MICHELLE It's for shoulder, but yeah, it's not… it's not gone. 

00:25:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS This is an interesting journey, Michelle. 

00:25:15
MICHELLE I know. Christ. 

00:25:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It is for you too? 

00:25:20
MICHELLE Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, let 's see where we've been so far. 

00:25:25
MICHELLE All right. 

00:25:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS We found relief for your shoulder itself? 

00:25:30
MICHELLE Right, front part of my shoulder. 

00:25:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Front part of your shoulder and the relief had to do with realizing you're not perfect, right? 

00:25:35
MICHELLE Right 

00:25:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You still feel the relief? 

00:25:40
MICHELLE Yes, and I think it make sense. 

00:25:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I think too. Okay. 

00:25:45
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:25:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Now, we ventured into the water between you and your daughter. And the fact that you can't protect the daughter you loved so much from being injured or hurt. 

00:26:00
MICHELLE Right. 

00:26:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And then you got a pain in your neck? 

00:26:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:26:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Is it still there? 

00:26:10
MICHELLE Not so much. 

00:26:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So what just happened? So then, it's not burning you as much. 

00:26:15
MICHELLE I don't know. I think, just breathing, yeah? 

00:26:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What you did and you did take a deep breath. 

00:26:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:26:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. And you kind of move like this. 

00:26:30
MICHELLE Yeah. well, yeah, that actually help. 

00:26:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What does that do? 

00:26:35
MICHELLE I don't have to be so stiff. 

00:26:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, you don't. 

00:26:40
MICHELLE Yeah, or afraid. 

00:26:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Or afraid? Afraid. 

00:26:40
MICHELLE That's the clue. 

00:26:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:26:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So say that again, "I don't have to be so afraid." 

00:26:45
MICHELLE I don't have to be so afraid. 

00:26:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And what do you feel? 

00:26:55
MICHELLE Afraid. 

00:27:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Wow! We're getting challenges us from every side, aren't we? 

00:27:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:27:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, okay. And then you get angry. 

00:27:10
MICHELLE And then I get a stomachache. 

00:27:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And you get a stomachache. Okay. Okay, we're getting clearer and clearer about this pathway here, aren't we? 

00:27:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:27:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, and you breath and what happens? 

00:27:25
MICHELLE I breath, and I focus, and I calm to help me. 

00:27:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:27:30
MICHELLE I'm okay. 

00:27:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And you know how you're focused? 'Cause, there might be something in that. 

00:27:35
MICHELLE I said myself like, myself I'm okay. 

00:27:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Ah! You tell yourself, you're okay? 

00:27:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:27:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS A powerful message, right? 

00:27:45
MICHELLE Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:27:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And so… it's okay. So can tell yourself that and really mean you didn't say out loud? 

00:27:50
MICHELLE I know it's true. I mean, I spent a long time knowing that's true, that I'm okay. 

00:27:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay 

00:28:00
MICHELLE Yeah, but I think my body going sometimes, yeah. 

00:28:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, let's make sure all your body is connected to this statement, "I know, I'm okay." 

00:28:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:28:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And as you focus on that statement some more, is there any place in your body that feels outside of that truth? Right here in your heart area? 

00:28:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:28:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh-huh. Does that surprise you that it's in your heart? No? 

00:28:35
MICHELLE No. 

00:28:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So somehow your heart doubts that you're really okay. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. Just it connects all of this together, apply guessing it? I think so. 

00:28:55
MICHELLE And this works, you know, starts. 

00:28:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's where it starts. That's where it starts. Can we find that word stops? 

00:29:10
MICHELLE Like? Yeah. 

00:29:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:29:10
MICHELLE I'll be wrapped, are we with that? 

00:29:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, we'd glad to. Now, see if we can find out where it stops. So we're looking for some variations of "I know I'm okay" that encompasses, includes, connects all of you, no part of you is left out. 

00:29:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And all you need to do is just to be open to wherever you find, inside yourself. 

00:29:45
MICHELLE All my feet are tingling. 

00:29:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Feet are tingling, okay. 

00:29:50
MICHELLE And, I'm excited. 

00:29:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Excited how? 

00:29:55
MICHELLE Umm… I feel it's positive. 

00:29:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, you're positively excited, now about what? 

00:30:00
MICHELLE I'm okay. 

00:30:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, okay. So can you feel that in your feet? 

00:30:05
MICHELLE Yeah, it is tingling. 

00:30:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It is tingling. I'm excited about feeling okay… being okay? 

00:30:15
MICHELLE Yeah, I'm… do this… 

00:30:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Here it is. 

00:30:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:30:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. Good 

00:30:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:30:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Good. Yeah, we've a ways to go up your body. 

00:30:25
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:30:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Right, who's next? 

00:30:35
MICHELLE Who's next in the chain, yeah, okay? Like, I want my lower back to feel good… 

00:30:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh good. All right. 

00:30:40
MICHELLE I think it's not yet. 

00:30:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:30:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS How's your heart by the way? Could you get your hand? 

00:30:50
MICHELLE I like it. 

00:30:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, I bet that was confining. 

00:30:55
MICHELLE It does it. 

00:30:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, good. So, do you know here that you're okay? 

00:31:00
MICHELLE As long as my hands there, I… I know. 

00:31:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, as long as your hand is there, you know, you feel what, you know, you're okay, right? 

00:31:10
MICHELLE Right. All right. 

00:31:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Now, that was an interesting movement. 

00:31:15
MICHELLE Right. 

00:31:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Are you trying out something? 

00:31:20
MICHELLE Yeah, I wanted to stretch my lower back. 

00:31:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, I think that is good idea, but let's do it more slowly. 

00:31:25
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:31:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, we'll do it together. 

00:31:25
MICHELLE Thank you. 

00:31:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, okay. So… all right, stop, pause and breathe, okay? If you're not back up, that's right. 

00:31:45
MICHELLE Yeah, that's… that's better. 

00:31:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Good. Now, I'm noticing that your head is shaking now. 

00:31:55
MICHELLE Else, I have to (inaudible ) turn up. 

00:32:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Thank you for telling me. 

00:32:00
MICHELLE Okay. Yeah. 

00:32:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I really thought we we're in trouble. 

00:32:05
MICHELLE Yeah, I know. 

00:32:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, I don't suppose the trigger could go, yes? 

00:32:10
MICHELLE Right, it never has. 

00:32:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, probably too much to ask for. 

00:32:15
MICHELLE That would… it kind of. 

00:32:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Because… there you go. I'll be great… All right. 

00:32:20
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:32:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So let's keep going, when you're ready, and as you ready. 

00:32:25
MICHELLE It actually feels kinda good. 

00:32:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It does, isn't it? 

00:32:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:32:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Where is that rhythm? And you can slow it down. I want you to slow it down. 

00:32:30
MICHELLE Yeah. I'm just… 

00:32:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, just notice what happens when you slow it down. That's it. Yeah. Not as loosing it. How does that feel? 

00:32:45
MICHELLE My shoulders feel tired. 

00:32:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS They feel tight and now, and they're moving too. You had quite rhythm going. 

00:32:55
[sil.] 

00:33:00
MICHELLE Not now, I got it… 

00:33:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oops! Don't forget to breathe. 

00:33:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:33:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And let me get you another tissue, cause we have plenty. Now head turns up. We have plenty of tissues. 

00:33:20
MICHELLE Mm-hmm. 

00:33:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. How you doing? 

00:33:25
MICHELLE (inaudible ). 

00:33:26
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Now, you do good, what happens when you connect with (inaudible ). 

00:33:35
MICHELLE (inaudible ). 

00:33:36
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I'm glad. What did you find there? 

00:33:45
MICHELLE I know, it's weird. 

00:33:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Ah! You found the team lift. Remind me of what does that mean? 

00:33:50
MICHELLE Excited. 

00:33:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Excited about? 

00:33:50
MICHELLE Being okay. 

00:33:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Being okay? Right, all right. Now I think we're trying to involve the more of you in that rhythm, and knowing you're okay. 

00:34:05
MICHELLE Okay, I feel it. 

00:34:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You do? Where else do you feel it? 

00:34:10
MICHELLE Umm… up my back. 

00:34:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Up your back? 

00:34:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:34:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Great. You didn't feel that? I hope. 

00:34:25
MICHELLE I think there's the line… 

00:34:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, you… I mean. You can't, you could turn around with your face that way, but, you know then, we wouldn't be able to connect. So… 

00:34:35
MICHELLE Right. 

00:34:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It is an option. 

00:34:40
MICHELLE No. I think, it's okay. 

00:34:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, in fact, we can share your excitement, you know? 

00:34:45
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:34:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Then you might not feel so exposed. 

00:34:50
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:34:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS All right. 

00:34:50
MICHELLE Yeah. That'll be okay. 

00:34:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, good. For those who are at my workshop, here's a ventral vagal in action. Sharing, together, we… that and we're working with rhythms too. Okay, so now where are you in this journey of inviting your entire body to feel the excitement and, you know, that you're okay? All right, good. Movement there, you wanna peek? 

00:35:30
MICHELLE No, I don't. 

00:35:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You peek. That was that. 

00:35:35
MICHELLE No, sorry. 

00:35:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, good to know. You can peek. Myself at… 

00:35:45
MICHELLE It's hard, weak introverted. 

00:35:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, it is, you know? It's probably not your first choice, is it? 

00:35:50
MICHELLE No. 

00:35:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS They'll up here. Exactly, how this rhythm though? 

00:36:00
MICHELLE I liked it. 

00:36:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I did to. I'm feeling it with you, I'm thinking it's really a nice rhythm. What do we have to do with knowing that you're okay? 

00:36:15
MICHELLE It's sending… 

00:36:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, I just feel that. I know you can't see this, but someone focused out there trying it out too. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, it feels good. See, I'm just checking how long from the time we're fine. 

00:36:40
[sil.] 

00:36:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You're so welcome. Thank you. I'm enjoying this. I never thought I'd be up here doing this. You know, check in, let's make sure all of you is connected to this movement, this rhythm, this feeling that I'm not okay, that for your stomach. 

00:37:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:37:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, that's right. Good. How about your middle back? 

00:37:15
MICHELLE I mean, that's pretty. 

00:37:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Sure and well, okay, great. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What happened? 

00:37:30
MICHELLE Oh, that's okay. 

00:37:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What happened. 

00:37:30
MICHELLE Oh, I just had a… a… a recollection. I don't have two frozen shoulders and again, it's… it's kind of like one of those things where, but it kind of thought to myself like, yeah, I get frozen and then… and then, yeah. 

00:37:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, I get frozen. 

00:37:45
MICHELLE I get frozen. 

00:37:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I get frozen too. 

00:37:50
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:37:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:37:50
MICHELLE Yeah, and this is… this is not frozen right? 

00:37:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And this is not frozen. 

00:37:55
MICHELLE This is not frozen. 

00:37:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's right. Wow, big thought. 

00:38:05
MICHELLE Yeah, but isn't it weird, I mean, cause, it's like, I kinda wanna put it other camp like, oh yeah, just a seconds matter, but I have all these documentations and… 

00:38:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, where are you going? 

00:38:20
MICHELLE I imagined myself. That's one today. 

00:38:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Just like that? 

00:38:25
MICHELLE Just like that. It happened, yeah. 

00:38:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And, well, you know, you stray out the path every now and then. Can we get back on, do you think? 

00:38:35
MICHELLE Yeah, I think so, I… Now, I'm (inaudible ) done. 

00:38:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I think that's part of get you back on track. In an odd sort of way, cause you don't wanna feel nervous. 

00:38:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:38:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's when you took a peek the first time? 

00:38:50

00:39:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It really is. 

00:39:40
MICHELLE Yeah, I was… 

00:39:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS We're talking, but I haven't believed our seats here. 

00:39:45
MICHELLE Right. 

00:39:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Right. 

00:39:45
MICHELLE Right. 

00:39:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS But there is one thing I would like to you to help me test. 

00:39:50
MICHELLE Okay. It's kind of going back to where we started. 

00:39:55
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:39:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You had a movement that you made. I'll do it first. Where, you're reaching out. 

00:40:00
MICHELLE Right. 

00:40:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Grasp of it. Now it is possible for you to keep that feeling of freedom, movement, excitement about knowing that you're okay. And still make that which… 

00:40:20
MICHELLE Kinda scary. 

00:40:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, well. You know, you wanna take our time with the one thing, is go very slowly. 

00:40:25
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:40:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Very slowly. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, that's good. That's good. That's, that's just fine. Does that feel okay? 

00:40:40
MICHELLE It does. So far.

MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:41:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Feet? 

00:42:00
MICHELLE Yeah. It feels so. Like, like, my lower left back is in the interval, but I think that's just because… 

00:42:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I think it needs to be in the rhythm somehow. 

00:42:10
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:42:15
[sil.] 

00:42:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, yeah. 

00:42:20

00:42:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's was too much, so we came back. 

00:42:35

00:42:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It's good. 

00:42:40
[sil.] 

00:42:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Is that an important learning to know when you've gone to far, come back.

00:48:05
UNKNOWN And you were a big question, but… 

00:48:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh… I said, what did I say? I said how is it amazing, cause several people said, amazing and then, I gotta answer, do you wanna say little louder what you're gonna… 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, so… what… 

00:48:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Can you turn around and say, I'm sorry. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, what… what… what's striking to me is how they were connecting to each other and… 

00:48:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS They were. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN And that the mind put above the and… and there's the history to the person and past and all the different elements of the whole system was connecting like one fluid within.

MAGGIE PHILLIPS To what? 

00:48:55

00:48:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Reality. Oh, yes, reality. You were right, let's not forget reality within us. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN You know, according to her, what she was saying… 

00:49:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, I just… 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN To give reality. 

00:49:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Good, thank you for reminding me how important that is to return to reality. 'Cause it, you know, it's fun being somewhere else with someone, you know, on a special journey, but you do need to consider reality to ride. Anybody else? Yes. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN I'm just very moved by the early part about Michelle. 

00:49:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Michelle? 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN Michelle, you said uh… I feel relieved just having shared, cause… 

00:49:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN You'd be joining, the beginning of I think out of herself during you and that drive herself… 

00:49:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's right. There's a beginning. 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN It's really touchy. 

00:49:45
MICHELLE So those people that ask me where the ventral vagal system is, where the flow is, I think you know, don't you? Yeah, okay. Anybody else? 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:55
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN The… the for me it was uh… (inaudible ) was to amazing and it's a example come to mind idea of pull out the mini code. 

00:50:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS mini code, yes. 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Yes, I loved that uh… good enough mother. 

00:50:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Good enough mother. In fact, she's sick. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:50:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You see that was a concern. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:50:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yes. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN But, yeah, very good work. 

00:50:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN And… and trying uh… psychiatrist and from my point of view was very informal to first moment is catchy, something or that… 

00:50:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN And, you know, and probably that was uh… you know, my cousin caught a moment and hold me on… 

00:50:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS He's saying that this moment was very and important to reach for something. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN Uh… Yeah… 

00:50:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN I accessed it through transition moment. Now this moment to realize. 

00:50:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yes, transitional moments, very important. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Like for instance, come to my mind idea of and emptiness, the uh… you know… 

00:51:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Emptiness, because we… this came into your mind? 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. Yeah. Last comment. All quiet men. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN I like the way you projected her… I think there was a moment where it is implied Michelle was fearing of… god I get into her like content, that's so painful umm… like I can't… I don't wanna be up there, but If I'm allowed to use this opportunity, I may not heal… what's uh… that's uh… hell but… allow us. 

00:51:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It was a hell, but don't very much. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN And then, and then you just were so respectful and protective, and said I'm gonna let you work on this, working all these feelings, you don't have to reveal a thing. Nothing that make you uncomfortable just stay with me, stay with the moment, I'm protecting you. 

00:51:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's why I was saying. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN She just got it. You really… 

00:51:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I don't wanna say, yeah, but I guess I was expressing that. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN And then I got the impression, healing was not superficial, healing was deep without any of us knowing. 

00:52:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS What do you thought? 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN When she could talk and without her having to say any details, and I felt that was miraculous and you talk a lot like Ericson. 

00:52:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, no, really? That's uh… the best of all. Wow! Thank you. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I told you… 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN The… the combined… 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN Michelle? 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN We're combined with that. 

00:52:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN But, unless you… 

00:52:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Somebody else. Last one. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN But with the combined with that as well, she gave the patient the opportunity to feel self empowered that… that she… she can make choices, she does have a voice, you know, and ensure very supportive with that as long as she felt comfortable with it. 

00:52:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's a good point, because some people are afraid that if you work this way, the clients gets dependant on you. You know, what I mean? There's a lot of that going around. You feel dependant on me? 

00:53:00
MICHELLE Oh, yes. 

00:53:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Uh… you were good, you're good. I hope in good way. 

00:53:10

00:53:35
