Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:15
WINNIE KING , M.D. Hello, I am Dr. Winnie King, in the lobby of the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. So, don’t be surprised if you hear some sirens in the background. Most people don’t understand that there is difference between a child who is just temporarily unhappy and one who is clinically depressed. But there is a big difference. And if your child is clinically depressed, he may actually be in danger, unless you recognize the problem and take him to the doctor to be diagnosed and treated. And that’s because clinical depression is a real illness, a level of depression that your child just can’t get himself out of and it can sometimes lead to suicide if it isn’t treated. But it can be hard to recognize. It might just take the form of constant irritability or even anger. And if your teen feels terribly sad that could also be a sign. She might hide it and do her crying in her room. I want you to listen to the stories of two families who slowly began to realize that their children were clinically depressed. 

00:02:15
NICOLE JOHNSON I am Nicole Johnson and I am from Hillsborough, New Jersey. I am 12th grade and I play softball. 

00:02:25
JOANNE JOHNSON Had she not been playing softball, had she not been a good student and really into her education, I probably would have seen more. 

00:02:30
NICOLE JOHNSON I didn’t wanna be like a burden to my family and like in school like they didn't want anyone like think that anything was going on. So, I had it just like if I did breakdown and cry like it was in my room. 

00:02:45
JOANNE JOHNSON Nicole’s Mother Most people think depression and I did too is just crying, sadness and not getting out of bed. But it's also irritability, agitation, argumentive. 

00:02:55
NICOLE JOHNSON My family told me like I was in a bad mood, I would just say like I was just damn. 

00:03:00
JOANNE JOHNSON It crept up over time at least for we saw now what was going on behind her bedroom door was different. But we just it slowly and at first we're thinking, well it teenagers and they're going to college and it's puberty and, but you know you have those red flags in the back of your mind. 

00:03:15
NICOLE JOHNSON I convinced myself that nothing was wrong because like I never thought that like I could have depression. This one I am for long time for most of the time that I was in the depression until my parents made me like go the psychiatrist and everything. 

00:03:30
JOANNE JOHNSON The therapist said, now let's go to the psychotherapy round, because that’s much better a lot of times in teens. And so we tried it for several months and she just wasn’t get any better, was getting worse and worse. 

00:03:40
NICOLE JOHNSON After like four or five months of therapy, they put me on medicine. I have been on three medications. The first two made me extremely tired. So now I'm on Wellbutrin and that's like it's a lot better. 

00:03:55
JOANNE JOHNSON And I was always an anti-medication person, so I've come a long way because I've seen what is done. 

00:04:00
NICOLE JOHNSON It's not like once you take it like you feel automatically better like problems are still there, but you can deal with them better. 

00:04:05
JOANNE JOHNSON (Inaudible ) come out I think this summer and that was like the first really turning point where I suddenly saw her back to her almost her own self, happy and smiling, again being goofy, being silly, going out with friends, and she recognized it too. 

00:04:25
NICOLE JOHNSON Medication will work up to a certain point, but you're still gonna like you still have to deal with the problems that may be lead you into the depression. 

00:04:30
JOANNE JOHNSON She still struggles and she may struggle for the rest of her life. I mean, nobody knows what depression and may be a one time thing or it may come out many times. 

00:04:40
NICOLE JOHNSON You didn’t do it yourself, no one did it to you, it's just something that’s there. 

00:04:45
AIMEE BELISLE I am Aimee Belisle and I live in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. I crowned Miss Rhode Island in April. 

00:04:50
CHRISTINE BELISLE Aimee’s Mother She has wanted to be Miss Rhode Island since she was a very little girl. 

00:04:55
NORMAND BELISLE Aimee’s Father She always loved to dance. You couldn’t get rid of talk to people on a phone, but she go on a stage and she would be very much at ease performing in a ballet. 

00:05:05
AIMEE BELISLE They definitely don't think that there was any specific incident that caused me to be depressed. I really think it was more of a chemical thing. I have the family history, I know it's in my family medical history. 

00:05:15
NORMAND BELISLE I've suffered from depression and I've been treated for a number of occasions. And you know since I was in my 20's when it was diagnosed, I didn't realize that she suffered from it also. 

00:05:25
AIMEE BELISLE It was like I was going through emotions of everything that I did. I didn't really find any enjoyment in anything. I was, you know I was going to class and I was going to, I was very involved in student activities. So I'd go to all my meetings and do all the things I had to do, but I wasn't enjoying any of it. 

00:05:45
CHRISTINE BELISLE Missing the symptoms in high school and being a nurse that really, really bothers me that I missed it. 

00:05:55
AIMEE BELISLE As a teenager, I mean, I you know of course trying to assert my independence and held things back from them I think as many teenagers do. I don't think that they necessarily would have noticed. I wish they had, because then I would have been able to get help sooner. One of my friends had noticed that I wasn't acting normally, that I wasn't acting myself. And so he said, okay, that's it you have to go get help. And I would you know cry uncontrollably. I'd ball my eyes out. And I would get to the point where I couldn't… couldn't calm down from it without… without cutting myself. 

00:06:30
NORMAND BELISLE To find a degree to which she suffered from it that surprised me, because that was very well hidden from us. 

00:06:35
AIMEE BELISLE That kind of place that I would go to would be like crying in my room and feeling, just feeling bad. I went to counseling. And the counselor also referred me to a psychopharmacologist to prescribe me some antidepressants. After about two to three weeks my mind had definitely cleared up. I was much more able to concentrate. I definitely wasn't as moody as I had been. For me, I think success is… is knowing that I know when I'm depressed and I know what to do to get… to feel better. I do have control over getting treatment and being able to live effectively with depression, but not suffer from it throughout the rest of my life. 

00:07:25
WINNIE KING Aimee thank you so much for telling us your story. Let me ask you, talking to parents, what would you want them to know about what it's like, the real heart of being depressed? 

00:07:35
AIMEE BELISLE Well it's a very dark place. You don't really know what's wrong with you, but you don't think that there is anything wrong at the same time. It's almost… It's a denial to a certain extent. 

00:07:45
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:07:45
AIMEE BELISLE And it's really hard to know that there is hope. 

00:07:50
WINNIE KING Yeah. Does it feel like you just can't get out of it like you're gonna be there forever? 

00:07:50
AIMEE BELISLE It does, it does feel like that. 

00:07:55
WINNIE KING Yeah! You mentioned in the piece which you saw that you now have a way to get yourself out of it. How do you do that? 

00:08:00
AIMEE BELISLE Well, I really try to monitor my moods. I mean, I know the signs of depression and I know the symptoms that I have and I can kind of see if I have them for more than you know a week or two then I may need to go get help. 

00:08:15
WINNIE KING Yeah that's… that's great that you have that sense of knowing when you need help. That's so important. Dr. David Fassler is a Child and Adolescence Psychiatrist. And he wrote a book called "Help Me I'm Sad", recognizing, treating and preventing childhood and adolescent depression. Thank you so much for being here. You know this has got to be hard for parents though to recognize depression in your kids. What you may be looking for? 

00:08:35
DAVID FASSLER , M.D. Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist You know, it's very difficult for parents and as we saw in… in the two videotapes, they often can't tell that it's happening that the symptoms are there. Some kids look sad or withdrawn. They may be crying and tearful, other kids may have problems with their appetite, decreased appetite or problem sleeping or problems with their energy. Other kids like Aimee had talked about, things that are used to be fun aren't fun anymore. They don't wanna go out with their friends. Some kids have headaches or stomachaches, physical symptoms. And then there are kids who think about hurting themselves. 

00:09:05
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:09:10
DAVID FASSLER So those are just kind of the classic symptoms. But what parent should really look for is new symptoms or behaviors that aren't going away and that are interfering with the child's life. And if those things are happening, get it checked out, get a good evaluation by a trained and qualified mental health professional. 

00:09:25
WINNIE KING You know, the… the term depression doesn't really frighten people; I'm depressed, you know. How dangerous can depression really be? 

00:09:30
DAVID FASSLER , M.D. Clinical Associate Professor University of Vermont You know, if depression is not treated, it's… it's a very serious condition. First of all it… it comes back. It tends to be a recurring condition. So most people don't have just one episode. It interferes with the child's ability to function at school. They fall behind at school. They fall behind with their friends. And there is also a very significant risk of suicide. We know that as many as 40% of kids with depression will eventually attempt suicide at least once if they don't get good ongoing treatment. And about 2 to 3% of those kids will actually die as a result. 

00:10:05
WINNIE KING So this isn't something that parent should just expect will go away. Even if it goes away, it might not stay away? 

00:10:10
DAVID FASSLER An episode of depression without treatment on average will last about nine months. But nine months in a child's life is a huge amount of time. It's very hard to catch up. And if you don't get good treatment then it increases the risk that will happen again in the future. 

00:10:25
WINNIE KING Okay, so you're a parent, you have a child you suspect may be that's what's going on with your child and may be some depression. Where do they go? How do they get help? 

00:10:30
DAVID FASSLER Well, you have to be an advocate for your child. You've to learn as much as you can about all the options. You can talk to your child's doctor, pediatrician or family practice physician, talk to the child's principal, the guidance counselor at school, call a local medical school. But the key is to get to someone who can do a good comprehensive evaluation. These are not easy diagnosis to make. You can't do it in 5 or 10-minute office visit. 

00:10:55
WINNIE KING And is this ah… workup an evaluation that a general pediatrician should be doing? 

00:11:00
DAVID FASSLER I know pediatricians who are good at recognizing depression, but I would say most pediatricians really haven't had the background training and expertise. 

00:11:10
WINNIE KING Now how do they treat it? What do they do? 

00:11:10
DAVID FASSLER Well, we use a combination of approaches. And treatment really needs to be individualized to the child and the family. In my experience almost all kids with depression benefit from individual therapy or counseling. We may also use family therapy. We may also work with the child's school and we use medication. But again my opinion, medication alone is rarely an adequate or appropriate or sufficient treatment for this kind of complex child psychiatric disorder. 

00:11:35
WINNIE KING You need both? 

00:11:35
DAVID FASSLER It should only be used as a component of a comprehensive treatment plan. 

00:11:40
WINNIE KING And in your view what actually in may… many ways help therapy? 

00:11:45
DAVID FASSLER Well, medication actually can help therapy. It can help kids become more accessible, more able to talk about their thoughts and feelings. 

00:11:55
WINNIE KING Well, Dr. Cynthia Pfeffer is also a Child and Adolescence Psychiatrist. She has also conducted studies about children and adolescents at risk for suicide and was on a government panel that evaluated antidepressants. Are there any studies that show for sure that antidepressants are helpful in kids? 

00:12:10
CYNTHIA PFEFFER , M.D. Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist There are definitely some studies that point out that the antidepressants still help children and adolescence. There are many studies unfortunately that don't show that and that's why we have this controversy. We need more research. From a clinical prespective, these medicines do work in well chosen children or adolescence who… who have the disorder. 

00:12:35
WINNIE KING Now, which drugs are we taking about though the children? 

00:12:35
CYNTHIA PFEFFER The ones that have been shown to be effective for example is Prozac. That's the only drug that's now FDA approved to treat depression in children and adolescence. 

00:12:45
WINNIE KING Well, Aimee in your case therapy wasn't enough for you, right? You needed to also have medication, how did that help? 

00:12:50
AIMEE BELISLE Right! Well, for me it was one of the… it was early on in my therapy I started seeing the psychopharmacologist and I was prescribed the antidepressant, which really cleared up my mind and… and made me be able to understand and deal with my feelings. 

00:13:10
WINNIE KING The kind of supports which you were saying that they sort of work in concert together. So, we have some evidence that antidepressants can help depressed kids, but over time there have also been reports and studies and stories from parents and doctors that there can be negative side effects in a small percentage of children who take these drugs. The side effects can range from agitation to severe restlessness and even in the worst cases to suicide. And their complaints about the drugs being prescribed too widely for other conditions besides depression, even though there are few studies that show their effectiveness. 

00:13:40
SUICIDALITY CLASSIFICATION PROJECT Kelly Posner, Ph.D. Maria A. Oquendo, M.D. 

00:13:45
WINNIE KING As a result of these reports, the Food and Drug Administration commissioned a study about the side effects of antidepressants on kids. And they held hearings to learn from researchers, parents and doctors with first-hand experience. Their conclusion was that antidepressants do increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in a small percentage of children and adolescence who take these drugs at least during the first few months of treatment. And they found evidence of other symptoms too like anxiety, agitation and irritability. One of the families who testified at the FDA hearings was the Tierney family, whose daughter Jamie was given an antidepressant to cure her migraine headaches. Here is the story they told to the FDA. 

00:14:30
JAMIE TIERNEY I was only child. I would consider myself a normal kid, love playing dress out and loved playing games. I had good friends. I had good home life. I didn't really have anything to be upset about. 

00:14:40
MRS. TIERNEY She was in second grade when they actually diagnosed them as migraines. It was very, very difficult to watch her especially as a very young child when they don't really understand you know to be that sick with migraines. 

00:14:55
JAMIE TIERNEY Going into 9th grade the migraines got worse. 

00:14:55
MRS. TIERNEY And we took her to Headache Wellness Clinic in North Carolina, and she saw a neurologist there. 

00:15:00
JAMIE TIERNEY And he put me on medication. I noticed my personality changed right about that time. 

00:15:05
MRS. TIERNEY She was very argumentive, very combative, very challenging, just seemed to be real horse strong, and she had never been that way in her life. 

00:15:15
JAMIE TIERNEY I tried to keep just my anger away from friends, but they did notice that I would blow up with them for you know, dumb, small things. 

00:15:25
MRS. TIERNEY She was the angriest child I have ever encountered in my life. And I don't mean angry occasionally, because all teenagers get angry. I mean, angry 24/7. And they're like, what is wrong, just this chip on the shoulder. 

00:15:40
JAMIE TIERNEY I honestly thought everyone around me changed. I know that's irrational and illogical, you know looking back on it. But I honestly thought, I was fine it was everyone else and I was reacting to my environment. 

00:15:50
MRS. TIERNEY I wondered if she was possibly doing drugs. I wondered if somebody had molested her and she was holding that anger in. 

00:15:55
JAMIE TIERNEY I'd just scream and say, I don't care just me alone. And I really withdrew from myself. I was just used to hear a lot of angry music and just always had this constant rage within me. I tried to commit suicide once. I'd gone and fight with my parents, I… people asked me, you know what the fight was about, I have no idea of what the fight was about. But I am sure it was something fruitless. But I just know she just like had enough and I go upstairs and tried to cut my wrist with the razor. But the razor was dull and you know in the movies, it just, it's quick, it's painless. It burned, it hurt. I just stopped. 

00:16:35
MRS. TIERNEY It was devastating. 

00:16:35
JAMIE TIERNEY I just felt like I was in a hole and like I was trying to climb my way out but I just kept falling. And I couldn't get out. And so my parents wanted me off the medication and told the doctor. 

00:16:50
MRS. TIERNEY We tried slowly… more slowly decreasing the dosage which is what is recommended and it did just didn't work. We had no idea that going off of it would be this ordeal that it was. We finally, on her 17th birthday, did take her out of school. 

00:17:05
JAMIE TIERNEY After about nine months of withdrawal I was very, very sick. However, about nine months to actually feel healthy and a feel you know to wake up and not feel sick. 

00:17:15
MRS. TIERNEY And I've never seen anybody so sick in my life. She vomitted 24/7 for days. She cannot walk. I had to help dress her. I had to help her bathe. She had electric shock zapping feelings in her head. 

00:17:35
JAMIE TIERNEY It felt like just shocks going through my head and this… like a tingling sensation however a very negative, painful tingling sensation. 

00:17:45
MRS. TIERNEY High school should have been the most fun time for her. 

00:17:50
JAMIE TIERNEY I am angry and I am obviously, I'm sad because that was high school and the high school definitely you know, shouldn't be like the best times of your life. I mean, you should look back and look funny on it. And I just… I feel like a lot of things were taken away from me. And I would have been able to enjoy high school lot more if I had felt well. I'm in college and in college it's just a lot of fun. Everything seems on track. I know now that it was the medication, because I haven't felt that way before the medication or since the medication. These drugs, I think were originally created to help people, to help people deal with depression. And I think they are wonderful thing for the people they help. 

00:18:30
MRS. TIERNEY If your gut tells you that something is wrong you need to go with your gut. I don't care for doctors standing there they're telling you that's not what it is, which is what they were telling me about the drug. You need to go with your gut. You're a parent, it is your job to protect that child. 

00:18:50
WINNIE KING It is so true, Dr. Kelly Posner led the research that were used by the FDA in their analysis of the suicide risks from these medications. And Kelly tell us about the study. What did you do in the study? 

00:19:00
KELLY POSNER , Ph.D. Columbia University Division of Child Psychiatry Well, first of all, it was mentioned that suicidal thinking and behavior is very often a symptom of depression. And the problem is that many doctors are very unclear about what things to call suicidal and what things not to call suicidal. They are often unclear about what questions to ask. For example, sometimes an adolescent or a person tries to hurt themselves, because they wanna die and other times they try to hurt themselves, because they want to feel better. This problem was very much reflected in all of the studies that had been conducted in kids using antidepressants. And a very telling example was a case in which a girl tried to slap herself, slapped herself in the face when somebody called it a suicide attempt. Now, the FDA, you know have this very important task of trying to determine what risk these antidepressants actually pose. So, we had to come in and… and make sure that all of the occurrences that were actually suicidal were appropriately identified and diagnosed as such and that umm… everything that was potentially relevant you know we made sure that… that we uncovered. And that's what the study… 

00:20:00
WINNIE KING What did you find? Did you find a pretty significant risk? 

00:20:05
KELLY POSNER , Ph.D. Principal Investigator FDA Reclassification Study Well, we identified a number of occurrences that hadn't been identified, originally that were called something like accidents or some other label. And the FDA were actually the people that did the analysis that… that of what the risk was. 

00:20:20
WINNIE KING Right, right. Well now, Cynthia you were on the FDA Advisory Panel ah… that reviewed and held hearings about the side effects, you know what did they conclude? What did you guys conclude after looking at all of this? 

00:20:35
CYNTHIA PFEFFER , M.D. Weill Medical College, Cornell University They concluded that there is a slightly elevated risk of use of these medications over use of Placebo, and they decided then to have a warning which is called a black box warning to specifically identify the fact that these medications may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and suicidal acts. And it also indicates the need for very close monitoring when these drugs are started and during certainly the first several months or so, the early phases of treatment. The FDA also was quite interested in being sure that not only physicians are trained to recognize depression and treat appropriately, but that families are educated about the nature of the diagnosis and what to look for in terms of how their child or adolescent does once treatment is started. So it's a collaborative approach that's needed. 

00:21:30
WINNIE KING And Kelly, is the issue studies with kids on these drugs? Do we need more? Do we have enough? 

00:21:35
KELLY POSNER I… I think that's an really important point, because you know these studies weren't set-up to look for these effects. They didn't know to anticipate them. So we need to do studies now that start from… starting from the beginning systematically monitor in a comprehensive way for all of these you know negative side effects including suicide. 

00:21:55
WINNIE KING We're talking about all of these side effects, Aimee did you… did you have any of these when you were on these medications? 

00:22:00
AIMEE BELISLE Well, the first medicine I took, I had irritability and in the first week or so I lost my appetite, but other than that I haven't had any side effects. 

00:22:10
WINNIE KING Yeah, okay. Well, you know, with this new information, you know let's start to return to the question that Dr. Fassler answered for us earlier. As a parent what should you do if your child is clinically depressed? Well, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen wrote "The Antidepressant Solution", which warns people about the drug side effects. And you know this is ah… something that you still prescribe though for teenagers? 

00:22:30
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN , M.D. Author, The Antidepressant Solution Yeah, I do. I prescribe the drugs. I have been a critic of the drugs been overprescribed, but I have certainly seen patients who are helped by them, and other patients who are harmed by them just like the stories, that you can able to show on the show today. 

00:22:45
WINNIE KING Well, how do you monitor for these side effects and how should parents monitor their children, who are on these drugs? 

00:22:50
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN Well, first of all I think the parents want to make sure that it's appropriate for the children to be put on drugs. And often the distinction that's not made is between mild, moderate and severe conditions. And obviously, if it's a severe condition, it should really be considered. If it's mild, probably we shouldn't use the medications. And I completely agree with the new FDA guidelines for monitoring patients, which is weekly in the first month. 

00:23:10
Weekly / Bi-Weekly Monitoring 

00:23:15
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN At least and at least every other week for the second and third month and thereafter as needed. But the important point is that this applies not just when you start the drugs, but any time you change the dose up or down. 

00:23:25
Monitor Dosage Changes 

00:23:25
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN Because the FDA warning says that's really the risky period. 

00:23:30
WINNIE KING Well, Kelly how about you? How would you want parents to be aware of monitoring for their own kids? 

00:23:35
KELLY POSNER Well, I think the important thing again with respect to suicidal behavior is making sure you know to monitor things like thoughts about wanting to die or wanting to hurt… hurt themselves. Those are things that we prevent, that side effect that would be important to manage. 

00:23:50
WINNIE KING What is it that's going on? I mean, you and I, we're all doctors, we understand what's going on here, but for people listening will they be kind of confused about the idea that you take an antidepressant and now you have an increased risk for hurting yourself. David why… why would that be the case? 

00:24:05
DAVID FASSLER , M.D. Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist You know, Winnie the truth is that we don't exactly know there are a number of different theories the medica… We were all taught when we were in medical school that early in ah… the response to treatment for depression, adults too may be at increased risk. It may be that now you have more energy and you still have thoughts about hurting yourself and you can act on them. It may be that you're more agitated. It may be that you're actually have bipolar disorder and the medication is stimulating a hypomanic or a maniac episode. So we really need more research on… on that area. We are not exactly sure. 

00:24:40
KELLY POSNER You know, you are feeling better so you talk about it. 

00:24:40
WINNIE KING For the first time. Right, right. 

00:24:40
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN But at the same time we now know and FDA warning is very clear about it that these drugs can be over stimulating to some patients including teenagers. So they can cause a range of insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks, irritability, hostility. And those are the really, the warning signs that someone might become suicidal. 

00:24:55
WINNIE KING Well, what are the most important points that you want parents to know about, just this whole idea of treating children with antidepressant medicines? 

00:25:00
Increased Risk of Suicide 

00:25:05
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN Right! Well, first of all, it is very important to know about the new FDA warning that the drugs appear to double the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in some children. Secondly, it's very important for parents to educate themselves as much as possible. 

00:25:15
Educate Yourself 

00:25:15
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN One of the things we've learnt sadly through this is that the drug companies withheld some information, so doctors may not always have the information. So educate yourself. Withdrawal is another very serious side effect. 

00:25:25
Watch for Withdrawal Reactions! 

00:25:25
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN Basically, any time a dose is going to be changed… 

00:25:30
Caution During Dose Changes 

00:25:30
JOSEPH GLENMULLEN …start the drug, go up on the dose to get a better therapeutic effect, go down on the dose because of the side effects or when you're tapering off the antidepressant, those are the biggest windows of vulnerability. Educate yourself, the FDA's going to be putting out new information. That's why I wrote my new book. I'm sure there is going to be a lot more information and parents need to educate themselves. 

00:25:50
WINNIE KING Well, you know we've been talking a lot about all of these drugs. How… How has therapy and medication helped you?
