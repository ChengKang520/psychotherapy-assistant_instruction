BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So impressed that you're here before 10 o'clock. It's five-day party going on. Ah, I wanna get a sense of who you are and what you're doing in field before I began so I can customize what I'm doing to you, all right? So just in terms of orientation, first, you can't hear? Need to go higher please? Okay, can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 not yet? Twelve, 13? Sort they'll kinds know? Keep going. Keep going, and higher and higher, and higher, and higher, and higher, and higher, and higher. How is it now? 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:00:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. Okay, so orientations. Give me a sense of who you are, what your primary orientations or, ah, how many of you associate in your mind most with psychodynamic therapy? Okay. How many of you with cognitive behavioral therapy? Okay. How many with EMDR therapy? Okay. Somatic therapy? Anything that works? Okay. All right. What I'd like to do during the presentation is give you an overview and as much clinical material as possible regarding the treatment, EMDR therapy as a treatment because it isn't distinct from psychodynamic and from cognitive, and from somatic though as an integrative form of therapy, it gives you the ability to, to integrate, to bring together that which works because ultimately what we wanna make sure is that we're able to help each other out. The history of our fields has, uhm, as has been well known for turf worse, shall we say. And what we really need to do is get beyond that, and take a look at what is best going to serve our clients of course, that huge amount of suffering out there, we're the ones that are gonna be able to do something about it. So, what I love is looking around here and recognizing how many clients you're going to be treating within a year, within two, five, 10, your career. And the recognition that you're not only helping the individual, you're helping their families and their families are helping the communities. So I just-- we'll hope that part of what you get out of this is a recognition of how much difference you're actually making in the world. Because sometimes it can be kind of lonely behind closed doors and an-- individual office. It's, it's really good to recognize that the work that you're doing is really vital for, for the health of this planet. 

00:03:15
Therapeutic Goals • Elimination of suffering and symptoms • Healthy adult including ability to: • Self-soothe • Feel full range of emotions • Maintain sense of self and awareness • Be an integral member of a larger society • Interact and bond appropriately • Resilient, positive outlook, cope adaptively • Able to set boundaries, empathize, contribute 

00:03:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, when we are using EMDR therapy and I think what get to send to the field is a recognition that we wanna relieve suffering. But what we need to take a look at-- one second. Do you need me? I'll ignore him? Okay. What we need to take a look at is, it's important not to get fixated on the symptom clusters of the particular DSM diagnosis that brought the client into therapy. I mean, as people can lead lives of quiet desperation, and then finally they feel they have to come into therapy because life is completely unmanageable. And so they'll come into your office with specific symptoms that they're saying they need to be addressed. But it's our job to take a look at that, of course we'll leave that but look through comprehensively through the clinical picture because ultimately what we have is the opportunity to help produce a healthy adult. Ah, it's the ability to self-soothe, feel the full range of emotion, have a sense of self and awareness. And also become an integral part of society, interact and bond appropriately, be resilient, have a positive outlook, cope adaptively, able to send boundaries and emphasize. So, what we're looking at is not the only the individual within their frame of suffering but what a-- how are they in their relationships. And I often say that when a client comes in, ah, with PTSD. Treating PTSD is often like taking the clothes off, the mattress. After you successfully treated PTSD, you see all and the other lumps that are underneath, because they haven't necessarily learn how to connect, how to have good relationships. There they-- and they don't know how good things can be. They don't know what the possibilities are because everyone they're associating with is kind of that, that level. Ah, you know, the jokes about the spouse and this because they're unhappy. Not really understanding how they can have true intimacy, have true connection. And so we wanna make sure that we look beyond again just the major symptoms and to who is that person and how are they within their society. You would be you know, that's better. Okay. So again let me see what you're doing out there. You showed up like I said before 10 o'clock for trauma treatment. How many of you are treating primarily, ah, sexual abuse victims? Okay. How about military? Okay, uhm, general population accidents whether it comes through your door. Okay, all right. Well, it just so happens we have a videotapes for that all the way through including the treatment of children. How many-- anybody treating children? Oh, great, okay. All right. So, to give you an idea of the empirical status of the EMDR therapy, in other words, why learning this, why learn about this. 

00:06:50
Empirical Status • EMDR therapy is considered an "A" level treatment for trauma, recommended by organizations such as the World Health Organization • More than 24 randomized controlled trails (RCT) support the use of EMDR therapy with a wide range of trauma populations • Research indicates direct effects on working memory and a link into REM sleep processes • RCT indicate that 84-100% of single-trauma victims no longer have PTSD after the equivalent of three 90-minute sessions 

00:06:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO It's considered an A level treatment for trauma that's recommended by organizations like the American Psychiatric Association most recently the World Health Organization. There are more than 24 randomized controlled trials that support EMDR with the wide range of therapy populations and if you look at the website, there's hand out that I put on. Then has though-- as annotated list of research. So the things that I talk about here you, you can look at it and, and get more information that way. Uhm, there's also about-- there's more than 20 randomized controlled trials showing the effect of the eye movement component which I'll go over a little bit. And research supports the hypothesis that EMDR therapy seems to link directly into the same processes that occur during rapid eye movement sleep. So, anybody ever had the experience of being upset about something? Going to sleep and waking up the next morning feeling better about it? Okay. It's not just that you rested, it's that you went into REM states. And rapid eye movements or what researcher say is the time that we process information, that's when we learn. And there's research that has demonstrated if you're taught a skill during the day and deprived of REM sleep that night, you loose the skill. So even though you demonstrated, yeah, I could do it, fine during the day. If you don't get REM sleep that night, the next day you're not gonna know how to do it. So it's that-- in a processing that we're looking at with EMDR therapy to tap into that information processing system that the brain has, and move it to a resolution that wasn't able to happen on its own. You know, explain why that occurs. 

00:08:55
Empirical Status • EMDR therapy is considered an "A" level treatment for trauma, recommended by organizations such as the World Health Organization • More than 24 randomized controlled trails (RCT) support the use of EMDR therapy with a wide range of trauma populations • Research indicates direct effects on working memory and a link into REM sleep processes • RCT indicate that 84-100% of single-trauma victims no longer have PTSD after the equivalent of three 90-minute sessions 

00:08:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Uhm, there's also research, the randomized controlled trials indicate that 84 to a 100% of single-trauma victims no longer have PTSD after the equivalent of three 90-minute sessions. Now, what do we means by the equivalent? It was either like with rape victims, 90% of rape victims treated no longer had PTSD after three 90 minute sessions. And Kaiser Permanente showed that a mixed sample, a 100% no longer had PTSD after six 50-minute session. So you have the option whether you, ah, in terms of the length of time that you're going to, ah, be working. 

00:09:40
World Health Organization (2013) • Trauma focuses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and EMDR are the only psychotherapies recommend for children, adolescents and adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No pharmaceuticals are recommended. • "Like CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive beliefs related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve (a) detailed descriptions of the event, (b) direct challenging of a beliefs. (c) extended exposure, or (d) homework." (p.1) 

00:09:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Now, just in order again to differen-- differentiate different forms of therapy, the World Health Organization and the references in your-- in that list saying that trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy and EMDR are the only psychotherapies recommended for the treatment of PTSD in children, adolescence, and adults. And no pharmaceuticals are recommended. So, the amount of individuals that are going to physicians or psychiatrist who don't know the li-- this literature and are being medicated for PTSD. When in actuality, there's not appeared to be the best treatment choices. The best treatment choices are going-- are going to be psychotherapy which that's, that's what you guys do. Now, when you have two forms of therapy that are recommended for PTSD, ah, it's also important to recognize that they're-- doesn't mean that, they are the same procedures. And so here's again what is stated in the World Health Organization guidelines. 

00:10:55
World Health Organization (2013) • Trauma focuses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and EMDR are the only psychotherapies recommend for children, adolescents and adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No pharmaceuticals are recommended. • "Like CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive beliefs related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve (a) detailed descriptions of the event, (b) direct challenging of a beliefs. (c) extended exposure, or (d) homework." (p.1) 

00:11:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Like CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive beliefs related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus EMDR does not involved detailed descriptive of the events, direct challenging of beliefs, extended exposure, or homework. So for instance, ah, have you noticed with many of your sexual abuse victims they don't wanna talk about the event. With EMDR therapy they don't have to give you a detailed description of it where in CBT they were. And the same thing in terms of, ah, homework in order to get effective results for the CBT treatments they have to do daily homework and none is needed with EMDR therapy. So that means, all of the clinical work is done within your presence and you have a regulating affe-- ah, effect on your client as they don't need to go out and think of the event or do things about the event at home when you're not around to help them. All of the work with EMDR you're assisting. So we think of you as facilitating the brain zone capacity to bring the, ah, the event to adaptive resolution. 

00:12:20
Effects of Eye Movement • Lee, C.W. & Cuijpers, P. (2013). A meta-analysis of the contribution of eye movements in processing emotional memories. Journal of Behavior Therapy & Experimental Psychiatry, 44, 231-239. • "The effect size for the additive effect of eye movements in EMDR treatment studies was moderate and significant (Cohen's d = 0.41). For the second group of laboratory studies the effect size was large and significant (d = 0.74)." • More than 20 additional RCT demonstrate positive effects of the eye movement component 

00:12:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The eye movement, anybody ever here that that eye movements are controversial in EMDR? Okay. Ah, as it turns out and this year, meta-analysis which is the evaluation of both the clinical and the, ah, primary research done showed clearly that the eye-- that the eye movements are effective. And the effective, ah, with moderate and significant and large to significant depending on what was looked at. So, we know with adds to it, one of things that it's hypothesized to do is to stimulate and orienting response. Now, the orienting response means that in, ah, an animal in the wild is eating, is grazing and all of a sudden something moves in the distance so they stopped, they freeze to notice is there is danger and if there's no danger, an automatically relaxation response occurs. So the research recorded hypothesis is that going back and forth changing the direction rapidly is increase-- is, ah, eliciting that same orienting response and indeed when they looked at the physiological measures, ah, for PTSD patient. 

00:13:50
Effects of Eye Movement Component of EMDR Therapy with PTSD Patients Sack et al., 2008/JAD HR (bpm) Time (s) Fig. 1. "[R]esults indicate that sets of eye movements were followed by a relaxation response... and a simultaneous in parasympathetic tone." 

00:13:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO As soon as soon as the, uhm, the shaded part is when they added in the eye movement, and you can see an immediate decline of the arousal. So this indicates that, that's part of what's going on which again can make it easier for your trauma, ah, client who is trying to deal with, or think about, uhm, in this terrible event that happened to them. And what you're doing, what you're giving them is a physiological boost that's allowing immediate relaxation so that they can stay with it better. 

00:14:20
EMDR Therapy Research Supported Hypothesis • Eye movements tax working memory - effects imagery vividness and decreases associated emotions • BLS stimulate a brain state thought to be similar to that which occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, in which sleep-dependent processing of episodic memories has been shown to specifically facilitate • the development of insight into and understanding of the memories. • reduction or elimination of associated negative affect • their integration into existing semantic networks 

00:14:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, the research hypothesis for the eye movements that have been supported is that the eye movements tax working memory meaning telephone numbers have seven numbers in it, right, cuz that's all you can remember. Working memory can only hold a limited capacity. And the theory as if you have someone think of the event and then add in a bilateral stimulation which back, back and of course have mid line. You're taxing the ability of working memory to hold it and it degrades the image and decreases the emulsion and that's been supported. But in-- and also what's been supported which where complex human beings so different mechanisms aren't work is that it appears to link into the same processes as I said that occurred during rapid eye movement sleep, which researchers have shown that, ah, when you have something happened during the day that memory is stored in a certain way. And then through REM the appropriate linkages are able to be made to other thi-- other parts of your memory network and that's how resolution takes place so that earlier memory when it's originally input has certain images, thoughts, sounds, feelings, etcetera. But the pro-- purpose of REM sleep and other processing is to allow the linkages to take place so it moves from episodic memory to semantic memory. Meaning, it's fully integrated with the rest of your life. You can think back and say, "I know it happened and here's what it meant, here's what I learned." You know it takes it's place to the past. But if it's not processed, it's going to be held with those old emotions and physical sensations. It's simply not gonna change in the way it stored, stayed there for decades, it's not changing. Why isn't it changing during REM sleep? Because it's too disturbing. It's overwhelming, the information processing ability to do anything about it. And so that's why you see your, your trauma victims waking up in the middle of the nightmares, cuz the nightmares and the brain is trying to process the information but it can't take it through. So, for instance, in EMDR therapy, one of the targets we can use is the nightmare image. So somebody comes in, says I've got this recurrent nightmare I-- I can't stand it, I'm being chased by a monster through a cave. Do you have any idea what it's about? No, we've been-- but I can't sleep. It's just keeps coming up. It's been there right, for years. If you target, and this is client historically, targeting the memory and doing a processing she repea-- it's like a veil gets peeled back she says, "Wait a minute, that's my uncle who molested me, chasing me through my home." So what happens in dreams, is the level of affect that the person is feeling will connect, associate with certain imagery that is parallel to an affect. So a little child being chased by her uncle whose trying to molest her, that level of terror that was there has stayed with her in her system but she's now an, an adult. She's no longer this tall. She's this tall. So an adult to an adult wouldn't correspond to that level of terror but being chased by a monster would. And that's why so often these nega-- these, ah, nightmare images are disguised. The person doesn't really know what's causing it, but again you can target and process that with EMDR, yeah? If they can't remember what the dream has been about. You can se-- ah, often access it through the-- their, ah, reaction as they simply think about how they felt in the morning, think about how you felt there. So you have a variety of different act, ways, to access in. Okay. And when by the way, once you process the early trauma, the nightmare stop, so there's two ways of again going into it. Processing this research that shows that processing the trauma returns the person to normal sleep. So you're getting rid of all the symptoms once the trauma is processed. But one way of making things more manageable for the individual in the meanwhile can be to target the nightmare to return them to appropriate sleep as you continue on, ah, processing the other memories that need to be addressed. 

00:19:20
Processing • Processing is viewed as the forging of adaptive associations between networks of information stored in the brain • An unimpeded and undistorted associative process allows the relevant connections to be made. • The emotions, physical sensation, beliefs change/transmute during processing to an adaptive resolution. 

00:19:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, so processing is seen as the forging of adaptive associations between networks of information stored in the brain. Okay. So, basically we were saying is that everything is the present has to link up with our memory networks to be made sense of. I mean, who we are as an individual all of this is based upon our previous experiences. And it's not, oh, I learned it, it happened. It's physiologically stored here that's why you're able to access it, mental processing takes place. So with EMDR therapy, we're looking at unimpeded, undistorted associative processing that's relevant to the connections that need to be made. 

00:20:15
Processing • Processing is viewed as the forging of adaptive associations between networks of information stored in the brain • An unimpeded and undistorted associative process allows the relevant connections to be made. • The emotions, physical sensation, beliefs) change/transmute during processing to an adaptive resolution. 

00:20:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And whereas with, uhm, other forms of therapy you would target individual things like challenge the beliefs, or challenge the behaviors, or have the person change their body to change their emotion. What we find with EMDR is that the emotions, the physical sensations, the beliefs all change simultaneously as the processing takes place and then it arrives at a resolution. Now, overlooked be-- within, ah, EMDR therapy there are specific protocols and procedures that one used in order to achieve the results. And one of the things we're looking at, is processing the entire memory network that needs to be addressed to bring the client to resolution. So if you imagine that something is disturbing to the individual, you access it in a certain way, and then when the processing begins, you have different channels of association emerged and you continue with each set of eye movements you see new associations are emerging. So you have a period of time where you're doing for instance the eye movement of taps or tones, and the associated-- tive connections are being made. And at the end 0f each set, you say, what do you get now? The client tells you, depending upon what they tell you either continue or you have him concentrate on something else. And again, if-- the instructions for the client is to just let that processing happen, don't try to force it to happen, don't try to cause it to happen. Don't try to figure out if it's reliable, just let whatever happens, happen. So I wanna give you a short, ah, tape of a treatment that was done, ah, the actually one of the very first client. I think w0rked with him back in, in around, uhm, 1998. And I absolutely love this tape, not only because it demonstrates things so per-- so perfectly but Eric who was-- wanted his name to be known cuz he wanted to help other people. He wanted to help other vets. So he wanted it to be demonstrated. Uhm, he's the one that taught me in terms of our Combat Veterans how much nobility was often involved. The veterans that I found, that I was treating at that time they wasn't the fear for themselves, that was so orphan debilitating it was who they might have hurt or who they couldn't save. And it was the guilt and the shame, and the anger and the pain that was locking them up. So here we have-- we've worked-- Eric and I have worked for a few sessions. Ah, he was only 19 when he was in Vietnam. He was made-- the head of his platoon at 19 in Vietnam. He need to call in some more artillery to save his troops. And he was afraid that when the artillery came in, since they were near the village, it might have killed some children. That's one of the things that was locking him up in this PTSD that at the time that I saw him he had, had for 20 years. So, we had processed these earlier memories he unders-- he understood and I'll show you another tape that I'll explain that resolution. But within EMDR therapy, we have a three-pronged approach. We processed the earlier memories that set the grand work for the pathology. We processed the current situations then bring up disturbance. And we incorporate and process positive memory templates for a per-- ah, ah, appropriate future functioning. Ah, but here, what we're dealing with here is a trigger. Current situation that's triggering his disturbance. He came in, he said, he, he just couldn't it stand it anymore. We felt like he was gonna loose it. There's the-- a guy at work that just send him off, made him crazy mad, ah, and he couldn't-- he was afraid he wouldn't be able to control himself so he wanted, ah, he wanted to work on that. Whenever this individual, this individual was extremely unconfident, and whenever he did something wrong, Eric were just, you know, be ready to take his head off. So that's what we're gonna be processing. So what I'd like you to do is notice and I'll, I'll talk you through part of it, the different channels of association that emerged. Now, this reaction has been going on for a long time. He just finally couldn't stand it anymore. And this so, we're gonna be processing that now. Oh, yes it did, didn't it? Any question so far? Yes. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN Do you consider the tapping technique also to be effective as that? 

00:25:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Ah, the research currently is that the, ah, yeah, ah, she's asked about the difference between the, ah, eye movements and other forms of bilateral situation, the-- we try it now? 

00:25:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy Fundamentals of EMDR Therapy as an Integrative Trauma Treatment Francine Shapiro, Ph.D. Mental Research Institute Eric 

00:25:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Ah, other forms of bilateral stimulation. Uhm, the research indicates that the eye movements are preferable that they're more effective by the way we came about adding in other forms like taps or tones is that blind people show that for treatment? So we used alternatives and discover that it works. Same thing with the tones. Children who wouldn't concentrate or were unable because they were too young to track, ah, you know, go across the midline. So we also advocate the eye movements to be used this, the first line of treatment and faster rather than slower. You see the speed I'm using here? That's a speed that, ah, initiates the psychotic eye movement that you find in REM sleep and that-- it's so quick, the eyes have to dart in order to follow slower tracking doesn't give you the same response. So the research they've done with the eye movement find that-- eye, ah, faster eye movements are better than slower ones. So again, what we're looking at, it's the spontaneous reaction. Think of the unconfident co-worker face at the beginning and what does he get all of that? Think of about the unconfident co-worker face at the end of the treatment after the associations have been made, ah, we all do it. Big difference, and that's we're looking at, how do you take this information that was locked up in the brain all of these years, and allow the appropriate associations to be made because obviously in Vietnam, in war, if someone who was unconfident, people could die. Well, anything that happens in the present has to linked up with our memory networks to be made sense of. That's what the brain is geared to do. And if the current perception of this guy being unconfident is going into memory networks having to do with people dying in Vietnam that's what comes out. Once you've process it, you don't have the same response anymore. 

00:28:05
First Session Outcome of EMDR Therapy Treatment of PTSD Figure 1. SUD scores pre- and post-initial active treatment session of EMDR and PE Ironson et al., 2002 SUD scores pre and post single treatment session of EMDR and PE Rogers et al., 1999 Psychotherapy Differences in Conceptualization • Psychodynamic Therapy: • Foundation of pathology: intrapsychic conflicts • Treatment: Transference/Verbal "working through" • Cognitive Behavioral Therapy • Foundation of pathology: Dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors • Treatment: Direct procedural manipulation of beliefs and behaviors • EMDR Therapy • Foundation of pathology: Unprocessed physiologically stored memories • Treatment: Accessing and processing of memories, triggers, and future templates 

00:28:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO He are some of the examples of, uhm, comparison of EMDR therapy with, ah, exposure treatment and the difference, one of the differences is with the EMDR therapy, the subjective units of distress goes down. With the e-- with PE the prolonged exposure it goes up. Here's another example, and these are with Combat Veterans. So the first session wat-- of processing, you don't get processing un-- until you pre-- ah, sufficiently prepared the client and take an history. But once you start the processing, what you generally see in the first session is the-- are decline of those se-- of the distress. And there again, the specific protocols in order, ah, complete it to resolution. So just in terms of understanding the differences in conceptualization for those of you with psychodynamic therapy, each form of therapy is guided by different principles. And they decide what procedures are going to be used. So psychodynamic, the foundation of pathology is considered to be intrapsychic conflicts. And the treatment is transference or verbal working through. Cognitive behavior therapy is the belief is that the foundation of the pathology are the dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors that the person has. And the way you change them is to directly manipulate the beliefs or behaviors. That it-- that's the guiding principle in that form of therapy. With EMDR therapy, the belief is that the foundation of the pathology are the unprocessed physiologically stored memories in the brain and the treatment is accessing and processing those memories, current situations that triggered disturbance and the future templates. So it's completely physiologically memory based in terms of the treatment though again because of-- it's integrative, you can bring in variety of things. So those who are for instance, psychodynamic therapist that may recognize defenses, where ordinarily you would talk it through, work it through the relationship with EMDR you identify an access the earlier memories from childhood that set the foundation for these types of responses and you would be processing those memories. Same with thing-- with transference, ah, counter-- and countertransference even, ah, issues. You're identifying the earlier memories that need to be processed that are feeding that reaction. If you come from a cognitive behavioral background, you can more easily recognize the negative beliefs the person has. But instead of challenging them directly you use specific procedures we'll talk about in order to access the earlier memories that are the foundation of those negative beliefs, whether it's I'm not good enough, I'm not lovable, I'm not in control whatever it might be. So, with the EMDR psychotherapy approach, the therapy-- yes, go ahead. 

00:31:25
UNKNOWN It's-- this is my first exposure to EMDR, and it would really help me if you could just spend a minute or two on exactly how many of these movements you do, exactly when do you decide to do them? 

00:31:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO This is not-- this isn't a training course, I'm sorry. But I'll give you the overview on this. What you're looking at is generally a minimum of 24 to 36 movements in order to get that information processing moving. And what we want is to get feedback after each set in order to find 0utr whether the information is moving or not. The length of time that you do for individual set is dependent upon what's needed to bring the client to a new plateau of processing. Meaning, if you're seeing that the client is not reacting, you might be doing it longer in order to allow them to come to a relief. Or you noticing that they had an insight that come in, you make it shorter. So the amount of time is customized to the need of the client, okay. All right. 

00:32:30
EMDR Psychotherapy Approach • EMDR therapy begins as the client comes through the door • How you see the client and the clinical picture is part of the psychotherapy approach • Processing of the negative and positive experiences is part of EMDR psychotherapy • Symptom reduction versus comprehensive treatment • What you integrate into the treatment plan is based upon the EMDR-Adaptive Information Processing model assessment 

00:32:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So the-- with EMDR therapy, as with any form of therapy, it begins as soon as the client comes through the door because it's the lenses by which you look at the clinical picture. Uhm, so what you're doing also is identifying negative and positive experiences because you wanna enhance the positive and make sure that you processed the negative ones. Wa-- so the identification of the clinical issues that the client may have if they're coming in with something like PTSD, they are clearly going to be looking at what are the, ah, what's the incident that occurred where these symptoms began. But with the EMDR you also have the understanding that there's a difference between simple symptom reduction of getting rid of just the PTSD. And to-- again, taking look with the rest of the clinical picture. Comprehensive, ah, work. If someone has been tied up with PTSD for the last 10 years, what is their relationship like? What has to be dealt with that? How is the relationship with their children? Wa-- what we're getting to that? So, why do you integrate into the treatment plan is based on the adaptive information processing model which is the guiding principle. 

00:34:00
EMDR Therapy -- Adaptive Information Processing Model • Clinical complaints that are not originally based or caused by insufficient information are as viewed as caused by unprocessed experiences • Impact of family of origin plus all other interactions and relationships • Experiences inappropriately stored in the brain are the basis of pathology and processed experiences are the basis of health • Dysfunctional/pathological traits, behaviors, beliefs, affects, body sensations are manifestations of the unprocessed memories • Physically store memory need to be accessed and processed 

00:34:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, let me just-- ah, the sense of it is, this is across the DSM beyond simple PTSD. Clinical complaints that are not organically based or caused by lack of information are viewed as caused by unprocessed experiences. So what, why, what does that mean? That, that information processing system that we have is geared to as we said understand the world. So whatever is occurring in the present has to link up with my memory networks. It's also geared to take disturbance to resolution. Have a fight with something that work. It's all that ner-- that negative self-talking and the negative arousal. Then, I back off, I think about it, I talked about it, I dream about it, and, oh, John(ph) who was having a bad day. We've done good things together before. I, I shouldn't take it personally. His-- you know, he's having a bad time. And so those connections that are made brings it to a resolution and informs you, you know, what I, I remember what worked before with John(ph). I need to do this. So it guides us appropriately in the future. But if the disturbance is too high, it disrupts that information processing system and the information from the event, get stored in memory networks with the emotion, the physical sensations and the beliefs that we're there at the time. And it's held in isolation, not able to link up with anything more adaptive. So, the feelings of the, the pain, the guilt, the shame, the anger is basically stored there. And if anything in the present links up, triggers that memory, stimulates that memory I'm going to feel what I felt before. Anybody ever listen to a friend who you knew, whereas very competent at work and quite successful? And they get on the phone with their mother or father and suddenly they're talking in the intonation childhood? It's because those unprocessed memories of the childhood are there. And the input of whatever the parent is saying stimulating that meryme-- memory network and that's what they're feeling. And go, again go across the DSM with this. Whatever the diagnosis is, we're looking at the unprocessed memories that are causing it. Because in, in actuality, whatever these experiences had been from childhood, it's really like you're walking along holding the hand of your six-year-old self who was telling you what to do in all of these different situations. If you have these childhood experiences that have, that have not been processed, so the, uhm, when we're talking to our clients, what we're trying to get across to them is they are not terrible bad people cuz they haven't been able to adjust, because they haven't been able to snap out of it as they've been told all these years. What they are asked to recognize is that this is a physical problem, it is the way, the memories or physiologically stored in the brain. And it happens automatically, the responses are automatic. I'll give, ah, an example. As-- I'll say a sentence out to you, just shout out the first sentence that comes up in mind, okay? Whatever comes up. Roses are red. Are they really? That's right they are purple. They're not blue. But you came out with it automatically. You couldn't stop it from coming out. It just this-- this the input and stimulation and there it is. Even though it is an untrue sentence and when is the last time you rehearse that? It's simply there. So the feelings that our clients have of shame, the negative behaviors they have whether it's related to OCD or phobia, or PTSD, or body dysmorphic disorder, whatever it might be, across the board, if the-- these unprocessed memories that are feeding those responses and they come up automatically. So what we're doing is we're not trying to crank them back by changing the paper and the belief or accessing the memory that are-- is responsible for it. And as you could see, in this five-minute tape, the outcome after successful treatment is different cuz learning has taken place. And now becomes the basis of resilience. And now-- with the inside and the connections that have already been made, and the different emotional response, the different person in that situation. 

00:39:15
EMDR Therapy -- Adaptive Information Processing Model • Clinical complaints that are not originally based or caused by insufficient information are as viewed as caused by unprocessed experiences • Impact of family of origin plus all other interactions and relationships • Experiences inappropriately stored in the brain are the basis of pathology and processed experiences are the basis of health • Dysfunctional/pathological traits, behaviors, beliefs, affects, body sensations are manifestations of the unprocessed memories • Physically store memory need to be accessed and processed 

00:39:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So dysfunctional bel-- pathological traits, behaviors, beliefs, affects, body sensations are all the manifestations of the unprocessed memory. Yes. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Mrs. Shapiro, I'm just thinking if this is a, you know, a (inaudible ) is there someone you could direct us on writing and of the same time on the action of brain function? 

00:39:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yes, it's in that list. She's asking if there are specific, ah, writings on the exact brain function that list, that research list that will tell you exactly where to look. Okay. So, memory networks. 

00:39:55
Memory Networks • Memories (information) with disturbing affects and sensations are dysfunctionally stored unable to connect to other positive life experiences stored within other networks • Positive and negative attributes are fed by stored memory experiences • Personality traits are habitual characteristic responses stemming from stored experiences • Processing transmutes information to resolution - - the components of the memory is altered as it connects to other adaptive information MEMORY = Stored Information • Sensory Input (Images, sounds, smells, touch, taste) • Thoughts (at the time of event) • Emotions • Physical sensations • Beliefs - These are viewed as "Meta-perceptions" - as they are the interpretations of the perceptions of the events Beliefs are symptoms, not causes 

00:40:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Basis again, memories, information, the image, thoughts, and sounds etcetera disturbing affects and dysfunctionally stored unable to connect. That positive and negative attributes are fed by stored memories. The negative ones are fed by the unprocessed memories, the positive ones are fed by the processed memories. And personality traits that we look at, what does that mean? It's the habitual characteristic response the world where they come from the unprocessed memory networks are pushing the pathological ones and the processed memories are pra-- are pushing the positive ones. So processing transmutes the information and the components to an adaptive resolution. So the idea of a memory network, again, here's what it's sort at be composed of, the sensory information, the thought, at the time, the emotions, the physical sensations and beliefs which are the person's interpretation of the experience. It's basically fed by the affect. What do we mean by that? If you have a belief, I'm not in control. That can mean something very different for a rape victim who has not been treated. And for someone in a 12-step program. Giving up control is all part of pos-- of the positive, the meaning of the words, the meaning of the belief is the specific affect that's being fed by. The beliefs are the symptoms, they're not the causes.

00:41:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, example of how we're affected, my told me to always keep my nose to the grindstone, my shoulder to the wheel and my ear to the ground. And trying to do what dad said, is all of those things are in there can let us say very well messes up. The, ah, EMDR is an eight-phase treatment. You identify initially during client history what are the past events, what are the current problems and you identify what the past events are that are contributing to it? What are the current situations where the person is disturbed? And what do they need for the future? And someone who has been a single-trauma victim whose life has been intact before-- since, ah, you know, before the, the critical incident is going to need considerably less in terms of the future templates than somebody who has pervasive developmental trauma. The rape victim may simply need a future template to imagine going to the area that had previously gotten her disturbed. The person with developmental trauma may need templates involving how to talk to people, how to stand up for themselves, how to set boundaries. All of these various areas need to be addressed and you would be doing it through your relationship, through, ah, guided imagery through modeling, through teaching and then through the processing. 

00:43:15
EMDR Eight-Phase Treatment • Client History -- Identify targets for processing: (1) past events, (2) present triggers, (3) future needed behaviors • Preparation -- Techniques for affect control and processing • Assessment -- Components of target (image, negative and positive belief, emotions, sensations, measures) • Desensitization - Processing of target includes emergence of insights, emotions, sensations and other memories • Installation - Strengthening of positive belief • Body Scan - Elimination of residual physical sensation • Closure -- Equilibrium and between session stability • Reevaluation -- Check that all aspects of memory network have been processed, and social integration achieved 

00:43:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Preparation is preparation to get the person able to do processing. There are specific, ah, techniques, self-control techniques that we teach. Uhm, I'll describe a little bit here and I've also-- you can see them in the b-- that, ah, well, it-- it's basically in order to give the client in understanding they're in control. In other forms of therapy, like prolonged exposure, the belief is, the reason for the PTSD is the person keeps avoiding it. If they'd stop avoiding it, the PTSD will go away. So they have the person described the memory in detail as if they're relieving it. I feel this, ah, the rape victim-- I feel him on me, I smell his breath etcetera. 

00:44:05
EMDR Eight-Phase Treatment • Client History -- Identify targets for processing: (1) past events, (2) present triggers, (3) future needed behaviors • Preparation -- Techniques for affect control and processing • Assessment -- Components of target (image, negative and positive belief, emotions, sensations, measures) • Desensitization - Processing of target includes emergence of insights, emotions, sensations and other memories • Installation - Strengthening of positive belief • Body Scan - Elimination of residual physical sensation • Closure -- Equilibrium and between session stability • Reevaluation -- Check that all aspects of memory network have been processed, and social integration achieved 

00:44:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And let your mind go any place else and don't stop. If you let them stop, it's believed that will reinforce that negative belief that they have than if they stay with the anxiety they're gonna go crazy, or they're gonna die. So the purpose in that therapy is to keep them at it for the 90 minutes describing it in detail and relieving it to let them know in the presence of the therapist they're not going to die. So they can't stop it during that time. Very different with EMDR therapy is you saw it's not asking the person to concentrate on any one thing for any length of time, it's letting whatever happened happen but because these original memories have the original emotions and physical sensations, there is a certain level of disturbance. If the client feels this is getting too much for me now, they put up their hand, you stop, and they use one of their self-control technique to come back to equilibrium, feeling in control again, and go on. So that's the preparation is for. The assessment for any particular target brings together the different components si-- of memory in all-- shall we tape for them. It's the image, the negative belief they hold, uhm, unshameful, the positive belief they'd like to have. I'm all right as I am. The, ah, and how is that-- how true is that on the scale from one is completely false to seven is completely true. Very often we're starting off with the one or a two. I-- is, ah, no, I'm not okay as I am. Uhm, as you hold together the image and the negative belief, what emotion do you feel? Shame, guilt, fear. This gives you the information of what kind of support you will need to the person and it's gives you a baseline. Because as you can see here, the emotions changed and you're tracking the change of emotions during the set. The physical sensations, where do you feel that in your body? It's in my chest, or in my stomach or it's in my head. 

00:46:20
EMDR Eight-Phase Treatment • Client History -- Identify targets for processing: (1) past events, (2) present triggers, (3) future needed behaviors • Preparation -- Techniques for affect control and processing • Assessment -- Components of target (image, negative and positive belief, emotions, sensations, measures) • Desensitization - Processing of target includes emergence of insights, emotions, sensations and other memories • Installation - Strengthening of positive belief • Body Scan - Elimination of residual physical sensation • Closure -- Equilibrium and between session stability • Reevaluation -- Check that all aspects of memory network have been processed, and social integration achieved 

00:46:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And, uhm, and the measure for the level of disturbance is zero which is neutral to 10 which is the worst feeling you can think of. The reprocessing phases, desensitization, installation, body scan which I'll be demonstrating are-- allow you to during the first phase the emergence of inside, the connection, the change of emotion. Then you're al-- then once that's resolved and their down to a zero, it's not disturbing anymore. You do the installation phase which is enhancing the positive belief. And then, ah, during the body scan, there is a physical reg-- resonance to cognitive process you know, if you think something, you feel it, right. So that's part of what were-- we wanna make sure there's no physical disturbance there. And closure, at the end of each session, making sure the client is back to equilibrium and that they know want to expect in between sessions and what to do. 

00:47:25
EMDR Eight-Phase Treatment • Client History -- Identify targets for processing: (1) past events, (2) present triggers, (3) future needed behaviors • Preparation -- Techniques for affect control and processing • Assessment -- Components of target (image, negative and positive belief, emotions, sensations, measures) • Desensitization - Processing of target includes emergence of insights, emotions, sensations and other memories • Installation - Strengthening of positive belief • Body Scan - Elimination of residual physical sensation • Closure -- Equilibrium and between session stability • Reevaluation -- Check that all aspects of memory network have been processed, and social integration achieved Therapeutic Relationship Necessary But Not Sufficient • [N]eed for a strong therapeutic alliance, specific truth-telling agreements, and a therapist who can convey a message of safety, flexibility, and unconditional regard" (Shapiro, [1995] 2001, p. 93-94). • A meta-analysis of EMDR research has demonstrated the relationship between clinical fidelity and positive treatment effects (Maxifield & Hyer, 2002). • Edmond, T., Sloan, L., & McCarty, D. (2004). Sexual abuse survivors' perceptions of the effectiveness of EMDR and electric therapy: A mixed-methods study. Research on Social Work Practice, 14, 259-272. 

00:47:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And then reevaluation phase, the next set-- beginning of each se-- next session is bringing up that origin-- that memory and making sure that the treatment effects and maintain and if there's anything else that needs to be addressed. So we're all aware of the importance of the therapeutic relationship. Wha-- what we're looking at those necessary but it's not sufficient. When you're doing EMDR, there's a need for strong therapeutic alliance with specific truth telling agreements, meaning the client does not have to tell you all details of what occur because the processing is going on inside. The rape victim, or a station victim whose too ashamed doesn't have to tell that that whose too guilty, doesn't have to tell but they need to tell you at the end of each set just what came up is it better or worse cuz you have to know procedurally what to do. Are there any people that might not be good candidates to-- for this? By and said in the Kaiser study, a 100% of the single trauma victims no longer had PTSD after those sessions. The people that cannot do EMDR therapy are the ones that say, "Ah, I don't wanna think about anything in the past." You're teaching it and so the question is how about if they're suicidal, or they don't have, ah, self-soothing methods. You're teaching them that in preparation phase that's the goal of the preparation phase is to give them sufficient self-soothing techniques so that they're able to-- ah, I'll give you the guidelines for that actually, a bit later, okay. So a meta-analysis that was done indicated there's a direct relationship to whether or not the procedures were done appropriately and treatment outcomes. And, ah, another study, randomi-- ah, that was done with sexual abuse victims compared EMDR therapy to the control, they found that the people in the control felt very close to their therapist and gave them a lot of credit but they didn't have as good treatment outcomes as the EMDR group which discredited the procedure-- the procedures. See, it may not get as many medals in this form of therapy as you have in another cuz what ner-- the communication to the client is, it's your brain that's doing the healing. I'm here to help, I'm here to facilitate it. We're going to bring the memory together in a certain way, we're gonna stimulate your information processing system and it is your brain doing the healing. So that, ah, I personally I like that because that's, ah, I feel it's quite empowering to the client. 

00:50:20
Client History Phase Evaluation of Entire Clinical Picture Symptoms that are not purely organic in nature or caused by inadequate information are based upon stored experiences • What targets have set the groundwork for pathology - trace present reactions to past experiences • What present experiences cause disturbance (triggers) • What targets will fill in deficits and bring the client to health - identity needed skills and behaviors (for templates) • Is the client able to access the experiences and allow processing to occur (positive networks) 

00:50:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So again, here, here's the three phases and again, if the symptoms are not organic or caused by, ah, inadequate information, we're looking at the past events, the current triggers and what's needed for the future. And we have to make sure that the client has sufficient, positive memory networks in order to allow the linkages to take place. So if you find someone with pervasive, developmental trauma, they'd never had a good relationship to anyone. They really haven't felt empowered, you're gonna be doing that within the therapeutic relationship of, of, ah, situations where they can feel your positive regard. Whatever you're doing in the present is going into their memory network. You're developing positive memories with your client. So you're letting them know that they're important, that you're there for them, that they're not gonna run it-- you're not gonna run away from you. This is going into their memory net work and giving them the positive memories that they need in order to allow the processing to take place. This is what you generally-- you might need for some of your complex victims, ah, con-- complex PTSD. Generally not needed, ah, to that degree. Ah, not needed for you to, ah, concentrate on that aspect of it with most of your clients. 

00:51:50
Client Readiness Adaptive Information Processing • Processing is the forging of new connections between the targeted dysfunctional memory network and memory networks containing more adaptive information. • In order for processing to take place, the client needs to access the information as it is currently stored - without "fear of the fear" • Positive networks must exist • The client must be able to stay present • Client history does not dictate whether the positive networks exist 

00:51:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So client readiness, since it's forging connections between the dysfunctional memory we-- network and the adaptive ones, you have to have the positive. The client has to be able to stay present and to keep in mind that client history doesn't dictate whether the positive memory networks exist, because this person can have had, ah, terrible parents. You know, terrible parenting, lots of developmental trauma but there was also a janitor in their building that took them under his wing, and made him feel good about himself. And made, made him feel important. And that janitor you're gonna be able to access the memories of that individual and use that to allow the processing to take place. 

00:52:40
Preparation Phase • Accessed memories will contain disturbing affects • Clients must be able to remain connected and "let whatever happens, happen" • Processing will continue between sessions • Access is incorporated and/or increased to positive networks • Client must be able to invoke a state change • Therapeutic relationship forges new adaptive memories and positive effects 

00:52:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So the access memories are gonna have disturbing effect-- affects and the client has be able to remain connected and let whatever happens happen. So, the-- the readiness is-- the client needs to be able to, ah, evoke a stay changed. The specific techniques so-- and, ah, have written them up as self-help techniques for people to use as well. So that you know if you're disturbed, you can change it. You can change the emotion, you can change the image, you can change the thought. This is great to give you stability at the time but what we're looking for ultimately is that this negative stuff doesn't come out. Now we all need a band aid occasionally, but you don't wanna have the person using it constantly. What you wanna do is treat is so the stuff doesn't come up anymore. 

00:53:30
Store Memory and the Reaction to It • Reaction to dysfunctional internal responses addressed during Preparation Phase and Attunement (see Getting Past Your Past) • Mindfulness, imagery techniques, Light stream technique • Sensate Awareness, Breathing, "Soft Belly" • Safe Places, RDI • Affect tolerance: Incorporation and access to positive memory networks • Processing of stored memories - pivotal • Integration of targeted memory and comprehensive adaptive networks • Positive templates for adaptive functioning Assessment Phase • The memory (target) directly relates to the therapeutic issue • Access by aligning various primary aspects of experience (sensory/cognitive) engage relevant brain/memory systems • Identifying positive belief (of the same theme) activates positive networks and indicates deficits • Belief statements are a manifestation of affect/stored information - not the agent of change, but the manifestation of pathology/change 

00:53:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So ultimately we're looking at the stored memory. Two things, the stored memory, the affects coming from the stored memory and the person's reaction to those things. The reaction to the dysfunctional internal responses addressed during the preparation phase and a number of those techniques are written up in, ah, my book Getting Past Your Past. You may be using mindful techniques, imagery techniques, wide stream technique which comes from the meditation tradition, sensate awareness, breathing, uhm, safe place where the person is bringing up a place where they felt calm or safe or any other positive affect courage that they may need, that they can access. And affect tolerance is the incorporation and access to positive memory networks so that it's pivotal of the integration of the targeted memory networks and the comprehensive adaptive ones, and positive templates for the future. So, the processing of stored memories in, ah, EMDR therapy is crucial. So here's an example, I wanna show a treatment tape. The assessment target is directly relates to the therapeutic issue. And you access that by aligning those primary aspects, the image, etcetera. 

00:55:00
Incest Survivor Assessment Phase • Father raping her • Negative Cognition: I'm a whore • Positive Cognition: I was an abused child • Validity of Positive Cognition: 2 • Emotions: Fear, Anxiety, Shame • Subjective Units of Disturbance: 9 • Physical Sensation: Chest, stomach, back 

00:55:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's an example for this incest survivor. The images of her father raping her, the negative belief she has is I'm a whore, because the thought that she had while he was about to rape her, that one thought she had when he was about to rape her has caused her to think of herself as a whore ever since from the time she was raped, when she, she was 15 years old to now when she's in her 30s. The positive she belief she wants is I was an abused child. When you're asking a person what's the positive belief that you want, what you're basically getting from the client is how far can they see down the track. So we're viewing information processing as you're starting out with this unprocessed memory that you're targeting. You're stimulating the information processing system and then it starts going down this information processing track as it does, as that information starts moving down, each stop along the way, each set of alignment would stop along the way. Some negative information gets off, some positive information gets on. Each changes, each stop, something new, something new until finally it stored in a different way. Okay, so when you're saying at the beginning to the client what's the positive belief would you hav-- like to have? They're basically telling you how far they can see down the track. It may not be very far. The be--the best she can do in terms of a positive belief about herself is that, I was an abused child. So you don't argue, just say fine and even with that, what is the validity of that positive belief from one completely false to seven completely true? The most you can give it is a two. The emotion she feels when she brings together the image, the negative belief, are fear, anxiety and shame. 

00:57:10
Incest Survivor Assessment Phase • Father raping her • Negative Cognition: I'm a whore • Positive Cognition: I was an abused child • Validity of Positive Cognition: 2 • Emotions: Fear, Anxiety, Shame • Subjective Units of Disturbance: 9 • Physical Sensation: Chest, stomach, back Processing • It is vital to access the memory as it is currently stored and through processing take the client as far as s/he can go within each session • Initial Positive Cognition simply indicates now "far the client can see down the track at that time" 

00:57:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The subjected units of disturbance, how much-- how disturbing is it? Is it nine from zeros neutral tends the worst you can think of? And the physical sensations she's getting in her chest, in her stomach, and in her back. Now we'll talk about the significance of physical ins-- ah, as well, the physical sensations. So, here-- move, move along so but you can generally see what's going on and what you're looking at in terms of the other, ah, phases of processing is you would be identifying with her what another-- a new positive cognition that fits better. And for her, it would be, I'm, I'm a strong resilient woman as I recognizing what she went through and how she is now. I'm a strong woman would be her pa-- with her positive cognition, incorporate that, strengthen that, scan her body, see if there's any disturbance, physical sensation, any part of her body concentrate on that and process that. And, and then when you see it, close the session and then when you see her the next time, you have her bring out the memory of the molestation again and see what thoughts come up about it and whatever new avenues potentially need to be addressed. So, it's not little one session therapy. You can see the changes in a single session but what you're looking at is what's needed for that resolution and you-- back to the slides please. 

00:58:45
HMO Standard Care Compared to EMDR 100% of single trauma victims and 77% of multiple trauma victims no longer diagnosed with PTSD after six 50-minute sessions. (Marcus et al., 1997, 2004) 

00:58:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And as you can see, ah, here's that Kaiser study that I mentioned, a 100% of single-trauma victims and 77% of multiple trauma victims within a six session but that's just for the PTSD symptoms, right? You also again, while look at, what if her relationships been like all of these years when she has felt the sal-- self-loathing. Has she ever been able to stand up for herself because of what happened? And you would be addressing that in more comprehensive therapy. There was a question. 

00:59:15
UNKNOWN Yup. 

00:59:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yes. Okay, but let's do that, ah, okay. So, uhm, - 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN I have a question... 

00:59:30
CBT / Exposure Therapies Craske et al. 2006 • "[R]ecent work on extinction and reinstatement (Bouton, 2000; Rescorla, 2000) suggests that extinction does not eliminate or replace precious associations, but rather results in new learning that competes with the old information." • "... accounts for spontaneous recovery in extinction paradigms and relapses after treatment" • "Extinction is conceptualized as the development of a second context-specific inhibitory association that, in contrast to fear acquisition, does not easily generalize to new contexts." • "The extinction model has profound implications for clinical practiced because it suggests that exposure effects will not readily generalize beyond the treatment context." • "One major therapeutic implication of this reconceptualization is that treatment should occur in multiple contexts in order to increase the likelihood that the new nonpathological fear structure or associations will be activated instead of the pathological ones." 

00:59:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO - I'll give you a break shortly. Ah, and here is just, ah, a bit more in terms of the underlying mechanisms that with CBT, what is believed to be going in is that the long exposures in CBT, ah, and this according to Craske and four, four, ah, ah, . others. Ah, results in reconsolidation, I mean, ah, results in extinction rather than reconsolidation. Extinction actually does not change the original memory, it creates a new one, that competes with the old one. And this is going to have certain clinical implications which-- want to give you a break now? And we can discuss it after. Okay. And I'm seeing that. 

01:00:20
UNKNOWN Can I-- can I ask a question. 

01:00:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Fifteen minutes, that work and we'll back at 10:07. 

01:00:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:00:25

01:00:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, I'll see you then. Okay folks. Uhm, I've been asked not to answer questions in the middle, ah, so I'll have, ah, specific question for you at a time where you can line up, ah, ah, a mike we can do that. Ah, I'm also going to, ah, more rapidly through some of this material. Ah, I'm also giving at the conversation hour that I'm giving on Saturday you know, we can have more, ah, customized step. But the thing that I want to, a, get across in terms of the different forms of therapy and what we need to look at these, ah, the top people in CBT have talked about, ah, when you use the prolonged exposure, you know, those extended exposures as I described. What happens is you cross extinction and extinction has a different nor-- a specific neurobiological marker. What happens is with extinction, the old memory stays intact but a new memory is developed. So the, the person who I said before felt that they might go crazy, they now have an experience in the office with the therapist that says they won't go crazy, and that competes with the old one, but the original one is still intact. What we believe is going on with reconsolidation, the research indicates the kind of length of exposures we use is consistent with that. As I mentioned that memory going down that train trap, some negative gets off, some positive gets on and then it changes and it get stored in its altered form that called reconsolidation.

01:02:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So the original memory is changed. And it might be responsible the difference between reconsolidation extinction might be the reason for distinct differences that we find in outcomes. So for instance, the, uhm, meta-analysis that have been done on cognitive behavior programs with child molesters have indicated they're not effective. And so that's why we all have the sense of the child molester has to wear ankle bracelets and they ha-- they have to trapped and they have to live not anywhere near children or anywhere near school. Be-- don't you have that have that sense, child molesters that's it. They're just so damaged, you just can't trust them forever. They're gone. Well, there was a, ah, a director of the CBT program who decided to add in EMDR therapy and what he did was a-- he identified the subset of molesters who were doing worse in the program, what does that mean? What goes along with child molestation, the perpetrator who is sending so many clients to your offices, right? They're in denial. "Ah, she wanted. He wanted it. I didn't do anything wrong." And if you talk to them, and find out that they were molested themselves as children they went as, "No big deal." They did not-- have not put responsibility for they are molest on the perpetrator, it was their fault, and they kinda wanted it, right? Why? Why did you want it? "Well, my-- I got aroused so I must have wanted it." The molestation victim child does not understand that, that's what happens when young bodies are manipulated. They respond. So they take on the shame, "I'm a whore," right? Same thing. So was-- I wanted it that's why it happened. So when they and for certain, I'm not saying that all people that all people have been molested are gonna molest other people, but a portion do. And when they go into to molest, they don't take responsibility anymore than they gave their perpetrator responsibility. The person who is responsible is their victim. And part of the whole, ah, therapy protocols and these, these offender programs are in group to talk about it, to try to break through the denial etcetera. So they don't seem to work. So what they do here is identified, ah, subset of molesters who are doing worse in the program, they couldn't-- get pass the denial at all. And they themselves had been molested as children. So they targeted their childhood molestation in EMDR therapy over six sessions. And what happened during processing their memory they got in touch with how they really felt it at a time. That they didn't have a good relationship with their parents, they were feeling lonely. They wanted the attention. They didn't wanna being molested but they-- you know, but they re-- the attention hook the person that groom them. And when they got-- targeted the memory they also, so how they felt, felt how they felt at the time, the loneliness the pain. And in that processing which is able to resolved that memory, they put the responsibility where for that event where it belong on the person who molested them. And in turn, they took on responsibility for what they had done to their victims. And the scales, all the standard measures they were using change. They now felt empathy for their victim. They now recognize that they had done the same thing they had groom the person, the child did not wanted to be molested, they just like the attention. And here's an example of the outcomes. This they use the penile plethysmography where they wrapped around the penis in order to check deviant arousal. You can see the shift in this deviant arousal from that six-month, from that, uhm, six sessions and that it maintained a year later. In other words, it was done. They no longer saw these children they said as sexual objects, they saw them as people. They were no longer aroused by them. So what we need to look at is the possibility that no one needs to be left behind. We can change offender behavior if we go in and process the earlier memories that are pushing the offender behavior. One of the individuals for instance had been responsible not only for molestations but for rapes and he was in this program. He was in denial about everything, had no empathy for any anybody. "Ah, she wanted it. He wanted it." Whatever it was. After he processed his molestation memory, he now was talking with the compassion and the un-- understanding for the children and he still was in denial about the rapes. He used the technique to track it back to what was pushing the rape behavior, turns out when he was being molested he started to bed wet and his mother was so angry that her son was bed wetting. She would take the urine soaked sheets and rub it all over him and send him to school that way, smelling from the urine. Angry at women? When that was processed, it shifted completely about the rapes. So we have to-- what we're looking at here are one of these earlier experiences that are pushing it. And this type response has never been reported with CBT and it may be the difference between, the difference in deviant arousal is with the exposure techniques, the original memory is still there, still feeding the pathology. But with the reconsolidation with EMDR therapy that original memory is changed and is no longer running interference. 

01:08:55
Treating Trauma in Psychosis Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale Van den Berg & van der Gaag, 2012 

01:08:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's another example. Treating PTSD of psychotic patients, with EMDR they no longer had the PTSD symptoms and the researchers were surprised to find that in more than half of those would started with auditory hallucination, they reported they were gone from that one, ah, eight session treatment, why? There's efficient literature that shows that many of these psychotic symptoms come up along with a variety of traumatic or adverse life experiences because of whatever configuration we would see those auditory hallucinations as an external, ah, ah, externalization of the negative thoughts the person would be having about themselves instead of I'm no good, I'm a bad person, I'm shameful. It's the auditory hallucination, you're no good, you should hurt yourself etcetera. Once it's processed, it's gone. So what we're looking at now is a study being conducted, identifying that full range of life experiences, ah, and processing them in-- to see if we can get the full-range of psychotic symptoms doing that. 

01:10:20
EMDR v Exposure Therapy/Guided Mourning (Sprang, 2002) • EMDR condition: Accelerated rate of recovery in all behavioral measures and twice the rate of positive recall EMDR also superior in 4 of 5 standardized measures Effects maintained at 9-month follow-up 

01:10:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's another example, ah, complicated grief. If part of PTSD diagnosis if someone looses a loved one, ah, suddenly, there you can call it PTSD. If it wasn't sudden, you can't, isn't that interesting? But that's with DSM. So, what happens very often in complicated grief that's not resolving overtime and the person is often getting negative images of the deceased, suffering, dying, of what they should have done or they could have done better and didn't do, the guilt is there. And these negative images continue to come up. So here's a comparison of EMDR and an exposure technique. You can see then EMDR gets the resolution quicker but they both end up in the same place for the negative symptoms. But what you see in that last graph is that with EMDR therapy the individual had twice as much positive recall of the deceased after treatment than the CBT group. And again, it might be because that difference between extinction and reconsolidation. If the original memory still there intact, it might be running interference with being able to access the positive network of information, but if that original memory is completely resolved then you can access the full-range of-- altogether the Christmas party together at the birthday party, the deceased laugh, in other words the positive. And this is really important because many people who have lost a loved one, a family member wanna hold onto it, the pain. They feel it's the way of honoring the dead. Same way of Combat Veterans. They feel that they're honoring their dead if they hold onto it. And they're afraid if it-- if they get treatment, if that disappears, they'll forget the dead. They won't be honoring their dead anymore. And what you get to tell them is no, the research shows you don't forget, you have even more and you have the positive. So that connection is still there. This can relieve a lot of people's guilt about going into treatment because how many people for instance have lost children or their spouse are still grieving 30 years later. They don't feel right about trying to get the pain to go away because the guilt that they're feeling is part of then unprocessed memory and so that's their punishment for what they didn't do, or couldn't do at the time, therefore they don't deceive-- deserve to feel better. Okay, so make-- this-- being able to communicate, letting the clients know that these negative feelings that they have about themselves are all part of these unprocessed memories and it's a physical problem. It is a physical problem in the brain, the same way as if they broke their leg, they would have no problem going to a physician to let it heal, you know, align it, put in a cast, let it heal. Same thing, being able to go to a mental health clinician and get that physical problem in the brain handle.

01:13:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, ah, we wanna take question period, now about 10 minutes, you have to go to the mike though, 10 minutes. Get the mike if you're interested. 

01:14:00
UNKNOWN It's very quickly this is all. Okay, very good. Uhm, my question is about, uhm, treatment of, of child molesters. Ah, I-- when you talk about the-- there's, there's a group of folks they included that-- don't, don't get angry with me, that looks at someone like Jerry Sandusky, uhm, for example as, as, pedophilia being a sexual orientation. Uhm, please clarify, uhm, the, the group of individuals that, ah, EMDR maybe affect us in terms of molestation, an individuals who are really quite like Sandusky who, ah, repeated a, a offending as a ra-- result of possible sexual orientation. 

01:14:50
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:14:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Again, what we've looked at now so far and what-- we need more research on the full-range of the dynamics that are involved in child molestation, but for those who had themselves been molested as children, nine of 10 here no longer had the arousal. Nine out of the 10 no longer had-- now developed the empathy and the connection. So it's a high indication that what we're dealing with so often are these unprocessed memories that are pushing it. Okay. 

01:15:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. In addition then, is what concerns me about that piece is, is candidness than be used as an example of reparative therapy, uhm, as, as heinous as that feels for me. Uhm, EMDR using and changing sexual orientation. 

01:15:45
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:15:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Changing sexual orientation? 

01:15:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yes. 

01:15:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I don't see it you know, as, as changing sexual orientation. What's happening is the experience that they had as children that have-- that started the deviant arousal, when they see a child of that age, it immediate-- it goes the perceptions of the child of that age go into their memory network - 

01:16:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:16:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO - and stimulate the stored memory of their own molestation and they basically reenacted behaviorally, sensory wise, etcetera. It's a physical issue. So is the act that they commit reprehensible? Yes, and so is domestic violence, and so as sorts of violence and, and assaults against other individuals. But if we let our distaste for what they did, stand it in the way of treatment, we will always have new victims. 

01:16:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:16:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO We have to be willing to treat in order to stop this repeated new gen-- generation of victims, each generation. 

01:16:55
UNKNOWN Okay, then I'm very hopeful thank you. 

01:16:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, thank you, yes. 

01:16:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:17:00
UNKNOWN Yes, hi. Thanks, ah, for your presentation. I have, ah, ah, client who has dissociative identity disorder and I've been working with her for three years. She's about 39 and I saw-- you presented the slide that, ah, that EMDR is helpful with 77% of multiple traumatized victims. And do you have anything specific, ah, specific research with DID clients? First, second question, ah, I imagine that-- it's used EMDR with DID clients and where is a good place to start with the alter whose willing? 

01:17:40
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:17:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, it's a specialty area in terms of, ah, treatment. You should know about DID before you attempt to treat, ah, - 

01:17:50
UNKNOWN Right, right, right. 

01:17:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO - with any form of that DID. And what we're looking at is sufficient stabilization to allow it to be possible. Ah, more intensive work in terms of preparation, in terms of allowing preconsciousness and allowing the appropriate relationships. And then you maybe fractionating the-- you know, somebody-- it's a specialty area. But yes, it's been quite successful that-- but no randomized control trials on it. 

01:18:15
UNKNOWN Thanks. 

01:18:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, but again, it-- but the, the-- theoretically, what we're dealing with from the AIP model, each of the alters is an outgrowth, is a manifestation of the unprocessed memories that are - 

01:18:25
UNKNOWN Certainly. 

01:18:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO - pushing the angry one. 

01:18:30
UNKNOWN Certainly. Certainly. Certainly. 

01:18:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The sad one, etcetera, etcetera, processing those memories and you get integration. 

01:18:35
UNKNOWN Try to do that with the number of the alters or the main one? 

01:18:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO You're doing it with all of tho... 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN Oh, yes. 

01:18:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO You are going for full integration. 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN Right, right. 

01:18:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, uh-hmm. 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN I'd like to ask about the treatment of people obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

01:18:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I'm sorry, I'm not hearing... 

01:18:45
UNKNOWN Ah, the treatment of, ah, people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. I've got, ah, a couple of patients where if I try to process the original trauma that underlies the OCD they need... 

01:19:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I, I'm sorry I'm not hearing you well. Can we talk afterwards? Is that okay? 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:19:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, thank you. Yes. 

01:19:05
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN Hi, ah, thank you for being here and for sharing this with us first of all. And this might be a little taboo but I wanted to respond to a question that happened earlier. I just, uhm, like it might be problematic pedophilia issues with sexual orientation. Uhm, and that... 

01:19:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Exactly. 

01:19:25
UNKNOWN And that I think there's-- I'm just a student so I don't, I don't know as much as a lot of you, but I think there's research showing that reparative therapy that treats people sexual orientation whether that's lesbian, gay, bisexual or, uhm, queered of any sort is harmful to people. So... 

01:19:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, and that is ques-- that speaker isn't clear. 

01:19:40
UNKNOWN That aside, I have a different question. 

01:19:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO There's a complete crossover and individual maybe, ah, offending heterosexually. 

01:19:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:19:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Correct? I mean, it, it, it simply doesn't connect to sexual orientation, but that's always, that's been an issue, ah, for people in terms of also shying away from treatment. It simply-- there's no stigma on anything, of any of it. It simply exist and needs to be addressed if its dysfunctional and certainly or sexual orientation isn't-- whatever choices is not, not choices whatever it might be is not dysfunctional, it's simply part of life. 

01:20:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:20:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, thank you. So, so my question about EMDR besides that is, uhm, I'm interested in practicing that in the future and I'm concerned about the impact on the clinician like even just listening to that video. I mean, I'm still assuming so that I don't have a lot experience coping with the stories that I'm hearing but I'm wondering if specifically was in EMDR there's any technique or protocol to help protect the clinician from PTSD you know, from exposure to, to all of that information. 

01:20:50
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:20:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, absolutely. First of all it's easier on-- than other forms of therapy cuz you don't have to hack here, the events in detail. Whereas, I-- as I mentioned with the prolonged exposure, you would hear every single detail of what happened to her, and it would be repeated two or three times each session. See, so that's the kind of exposure that, that you, you don't get with EMDR. In looking at, at, ah, the clinician response, what we wanna make sure is that the clinician has the self-control techniques that allow them to maintain equilibrium. It's also a lot easier to deal with because you know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and you-- I love the sessions because wherever the pain is beginning, I know it's gonna get done and I can see it, you know, you showed that slide that's why you can see it within you know, contracted amounts of time. And so the other thing we need to take a look at is what is clinician's affect tolerance? Where might you have-- not you, in general, clinicians have unprocessed memories that say it's dangerous to feel? I mean, I remember this, this, uhm, ah, when a training session cuz in the EMDR training sessions you give and receive the procedures on your own material. And we wa-- I was, ah, standing next to a clinician who was now gonna be the therapist and as the client was beginning to talking, starting to emote. He said, "Oh, no, no, you don't have to feel that now." He was pushing it down. Well, it turned out, it was connected to an early memory that he had and he was willing to work on it and was able to change it. So, there are, ah, self-awareness scales, questionnaires we have to therapist to identify where they might be stocked, where cou-- countertransference maybe coming up for them in the variety of different ways. How many of you might have had childhood experiences of being unable to comfort a parent? Who were-- or, or a family member who was crying and so you get upset and feel like you've got to do something and you really can't cuz you know, it come up our life, comes up in our office just as the clients do. So the more self-awareness we have, of where our hot points are the better and the willingness to get them processed. 

01:23:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:23:30
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA # EVO2013 

01:23:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, sure, yes. 

01:23:30
UNKNOWN This is a question about a client's theoretically who has gone through processed of trauma or whatever a memory. Now, post that, would you say that their ability or potential ability to be more effective in REM to reconcile like daily, whatever conflicts based on having had this experience so it's almost like a muscle strengthening or generalization into their REM capability? 

01:23:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, if, if you take a-- if you finished the processing it does become learning takes place through the processing. It just become a foundation for resilience and there has been research that had shown the difference in reaction to others after the EDMR processing which works all the way across the board. I mean even in mediation, reconciliation that we try to do internationally. If both sides are dealing with the unprocessed memories from the war, and all the historical trauma that's been transmitted through stories it can hear each other. They're continually having their own stuff trigger so they can't make the connections once the processing is done we're able to do it. Okay, the-- I'm sorry, that's 10 minutes. We'll have another question period, okay. 

01:24:45
Combat Trauma • Successive day EMDR therapy treatment for both veterans and active duty military is proving successful. • EMDR therapy are administrative twice daily • Treatment is complete in 1-2 weeks • Treatment can also be given weekly, twice weekly or whenever schedules permit • Complete processing of past/present/future AIP -- Chronic Plan • Physical x Emotional x Cognitive • Memories contain images/smells/taste, thoughts, emotions, physical sensations • Unprocessed memories are stored in the brain with the physical sensations experienced during the event • Although stored in the brain they are experienced in the body through the affarent/efferent nervous system • Memory processing transmutes all sensory information simultaneously • AIP prediction: The processing of etiological memories will result in the decrease or elimination of chronic pain 

01:24:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, uhm, I'm going to-- see, we have an hour left. Uhm, let me, let me go on to the, uhm, child treatment after a little bit, and then, ah, we can come back to the combat trauma since we already saw error. Uhm, I wanna make clear also for many combat, many accident victims, what they have is chronic pain. And the, ah, the chronic pain that a person might have maybe the result of the unprocessed memory that they're experiencing so that many people for instance who have been in like, ah, an accident where their limp was damaged and had to be amputated still feel pain in the limp that no longer exist. So when some, some folks say, well the memory is in the body. Well, there's nobody there. What it's indicating is that the reason that the pain is there is the memory containing the emotion, physical sensations, beliefs, etcetera is unprocessed. This is the cause of the pain. It's being experienced through the af-- aferent-- afferent nervous system as if it was in the limp which no longer exist. 

01:26:20
EMDR Treatment of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) EMDR Treatment of PLP (Russell, 2007) Phantom Limb Pain-Pain Score (De Roos et al., 2010) 

01:26:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So the EMDR processing for instance of a combat veteran who had, ah, phantom limp pain and any had preexisting PTSD, you can see after two sessions, the difference in treatment on the impact of event scale and the Beck Depression Inventory from targeting the memory of the accident in which his leg was smashed and had to be amputated. All right. In addition, he had phantom limp pain that at the time initially as you can on that zero, 1o scale. Ah, s-- a sowing pain, shooting pain, a radiating pain and ache and tingling, all these different types of pain you can see within the two sessions was resolved except there was still some tingling which we would hypothesize is actual nerve damage. So, remember I started out with unless something is caused by an organic issue, we would say an experiential contributor. Here, you conceive that most of this terrible pain that he was experiencing for all those years was actually the unprocessed memory that was stored once it was processed, it was gone. And there had been about five different studies that, uhm, ah, articles that have been published in the aggregate. Here's one of the other ones, indicates an average of 80% success rate with phantom limp pain which means a substantial decrease or eliminate-- complete elimination of the pain. So, it's not only good news for all these combat veterans that are coming back with phantom limp pain because the body armor protected them from dying but they have all these excruciating, ah, limp pain that's not-- doesn't-- the limp doesn't exist. Ah, but women who have had radical mastectomies often report phantom breast pain. The doctors can't figure it out so they medicate them. Processing the memory allows it disappear. Ah, there are unex-- medically unexplained symptoms of chronic pain ticks etcetera, can't stemming from unprocessed memories are able to be addressed once the memory is processed. Okay. 

01:28:50
Complex PTSD • The length of Phase 1 varies and depends on a factors including age of trauma onset, duration and intensity of trauma exposure, and capacity of effect tolerance and regulation. • Trauma history does not always predict the extent of time needed for stabilization • Many complex trauma victims have had the benefit of positive life experiences, including reparative, secure attachments, and as a result, require only relatively short stabilization phase. 

01:28:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO All right, moving on. Complex PTSD, the length that-- the Phase, ah, one, uhm, and Phase two which is the history, varies and depends on the number of factors including age and onset, duro-- duration intensity exposure. Trauma history doesn't always predict the extent of time needed for stabilization. What you're looking at is the client able to maintain awareness and evoke a state change with you, in your office wo-- and there-- a number of factors I'll talk about but then many complex PTS-- ah, trauma victims had the benefit of positive left experiences including, ah, secure attachments and therefore they only need a relatively short stabilization phase. 

01:29:45
Van der Kolk, et al., 2006 J Clinical Psychiatry PRE-POST & FOLLOW-UP ANALYSES OF BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY Asymptomatic End-state Function (CAPS score <20) by Treatment Type and Index Trauma Onset 88.9% PTSD remission 91.7% PTSD remission 

01:29:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's a-- uhm, study that was done by Van der Kolk. Here, it was EMDR therapy compared to Prozac for PTSD victims and you can see the difference of EMDR therapy being superior to Prozac. It was eight sessions of therapy, eight weeks of Prozac and both were terminated, ah, and see what the results are. The, uhm, EMDR group continued to get better while the Prozac group contin-- actually those who had been asymp-- symptomatic started to get symptoms again because the antidepressant that's been used at the time, that's affecting the depression changing the brain chemistry is the person cannot necessarily feel the negative feelings. But once you terminate it, there's a rebound of the symptoms often because you haven't dealt with the reasons for the depression to begin which, which are those unprocessed now and here you can a difference when I'll talk about between symptom reduction and comprehensive treatment. Here's a difference between child onset PTSD, there was an 88 after these eight sessions, 88.9% PTSD remission for that group. For adult onset, it was 91.7% that's pretty good, right? Comparable. But look at the difference between asymptomatic. Only 30% of the complex PTSD group were finished in three sessions compared to close to 80% in the adult onset, because what you're looking at is how many memories are going to need-- to be addressed. When you have a problem that starting in childhood where the person is feeling, I'm not good enough, you know, the feelings of, of shame involved in, ah, being not good enough. So when they go into a situation they act in a certain way, they get negative feedback. That get stored in memory too. Every time we're out interacting with people from a, ah, from an insecure, anxious, shameful, angry flakes, we get the reactions-- negative reactions from individuals that also get stored in memory increasing the pathology, increasing that negative sense of self therefore more processing needs to be done. When we're looking at the processing, uhm, we have to think about for instance, for complex PTSD, borderline personality that level of emotional ability in which people are trying to stabilize before we do treatment. How many of you have worked for years trying to stabilize? I mean, think about what's going on. The reason for the emotional liability is this volcano of emotion from this unprocessed memories that keep pushing on. So what we're trying to do is do sufficient amount of stabilization that lets the processing begin. And once you're doing the processing and eliminating those feeders of those negative affects then that itself is increasing emotional stability. 

01:33:20
Complex PTSD • Assessment of stabilization should be a primary factor, particularly regarding the attainment of sufficient affect regulation to move to processing. • In some cases, stabilization can best be achieved by processing the traumatic memories that contain a "volcano" of disturbing affects that continue to be triggered in the present. • The therapist addresses the client's fears about emotion, teaching the client about emotions, and actively practicing emotion modulation and regulation with the client in the cortex of the therapeutic relationship. • Skills training typically include an emphasis on state change techniques, and mindful self-attunement. • If there is sufficient effect regulation and utilization of self-help modulation techniques to maintain client stability during and between sessions, treatment proceeds to memory processing. • Memory processing can commerce when clients are able to demonstrate: (1) the ability to access positive and adaptive experiences; (2)s the ability to regulate and tolerate effect within and outside of session; (3) the ability remain grounded in the present and in contact with the therapist when focusing on the past; (4) the effective use of support systems. 

01:33:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So the assessment of stabilization is a primary factor. And in some cases, it's best to process the memories as soon as possible during the preparation phase, the therapist addresses the client fears about emotion, thus the education, thus the skill training etcetera. If there's sufficient affect regulation and utilization of self-help techniques that maintain client stability and between, it's okay to begin memory processing. So here, ah, would be the guidelines. Memory processing can commence when clients are able to demonstrates, one, the ability to access positive and adaptive experiences. Two, the ability to regulate and tolerate affect within and outside of the session. The ability to remain grounded in the present and in contact with the therapist when focused on the past. And the effective use of support systems. So just enough, just enough stabilization not that you're trying to handle every issue, every relationship, all of that stuff before you begin trauma processing, recognized its, ah, the unprocessed traumas themselves that are pushing all of these dysfunction in a variety of areas. 

01:34:40
Dissociative Disorder • Development of infant awareness initially based on physical need • Hardwired responses to elicit care and attention • Lack of attention/neglect cause failure to thrive • Negative/traumatic responses prevent development of sense of cause/effect universe and sense of self • Memories stored in fragments due to high arousal • Configurations of memory are the basis of "ego states," "parts," or alters • Host/observer/Self-not established with sense of physical/psychic presence • Activation other networks cause awareness to move to the network and lose host • Preparation work includes incorporation of positive networks, and initial links between memory networks to allow co-consciousness • Incorporate state change as choice 

01:34:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So with dissociative disorder, uhm, the development of that infant awareness, that crying out is supposed to automatically bring response, positive response and it doesn't or hardwired through the sound of the-- of to elicit caring. But if a mom has PTSD that's not gonna happen. You can make more agitated you see. So there's a lot of reasons for children to be mistreated and the negative traumatic responses pres-- prevent the development of a sense of cause and effect in the universe, crying response is not happening. So the memories are stored in fragments due to high arousal. And those configurations whether you call them ego state, parts or alters are actually based on these different memory networks and that host observer self doesn't have enough memory networks there for the self-awareness, the physical presence etcetera. And therefore when any of these traumatic memories get stimulated it often brings out an alter and the host looses consciousness because there's not the cohesiveness. So, as I said, the longer preparation phase in order to allow those connections to be made, ah, important. 

01:36:00
Personality Disorder • Rigidified characteristic behaviors and responses • Each characteristic and "defense" is an overarching issue. The specific kind of habitual response is identified, targeted through a memory, and processed • Templates include appropriate socialization and developmental experiences to overcome childhood deficits 

01:36:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Same thing with personality disorders in general. The rigidified characteristic behaviors and responses are what to find to personality disorder, however it's diced in the DSM. The bottom line is each characteristic or defense is based on previous experience, again the unprocessed memories that are stored in the brain. So, relationship problems that often show up are these over-- in an overarching issue. What you're looking for is what is the habitual response like clingy, angry, violent, push away, what's the negative response that goes along with it regardless of what the personality char-- uhm, disorder label is. And track it back to the earlier experiences that are pushing it. 

01:37:00
Unstable Relative, Toddler Compete For Attention At Family Get-Together 

01:37:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here is something that appeared in the Onion. Unstable relative and toddler compete for attention at a family gathering. Right? Why is this going on? Because in each of these different cases that we're talking about with these personality disorders is a case of arrested development, that those unprocessed memories have been frozen in time since the time and childhood where they were experienced. And those childhood affects are what's winning the show. So your attempt to make sense of it, why is she or he responding that way? Don't they know that? It's all coming up automatically same thing violets are blue it's just there. And there's no thought involved, it's an automatic response. 

01:38:00
Borderline Personality Disorder • Affect lability a results of unprocessed memories • Relationship problems involve triggering of affects related to lack of worth and fears of abandonment • Earlier experiences that forged those are targeted • Raging at therapist (or family member) for "not caring" comes from dysfunctional node being triggered • All the months of positive therapeutic experiences are in another network- -not linked up. • At that moment the experiences aren't accessible - - they don't exist 

01:38:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So with borderline personality disorder, everybody treating borderline personality disorder? Anybody been driven crazy at times or borderline persona-- why? Well, the affect lability again is the result of the unprocessed memories. Now, you have given up your weekend to be on the phone on call and have worked through, through x, y and z. You have done your best, so many different ways and suddenly you're in the session and the client is raging at you for not caring and not being there. Ever had that experience? So what's going on? While the experiences that you have had whether you had connection, where you've given support they're in the brain but it's toward in a separate memory network. These unprocessed memories from childhood are stored in isolation, they cannot link up with anything more adaptive. So, if you looked at your watch, it can stimulate, you don't care about me, you're ignoring me because you've just stimulated these unprocessed memories and that's why the rage and the anger is coming up, that's why the pain is there. So everything that you've done that's been positive is not lost, it's there. But the client is not going to have access to it and you're not going to have stable relationship until you've processed these earlier memories. 

01:39:50
Borderline Personality Disorder • Affect lability a results of unprocessed memories • Relationship problems involve triggering of affects related to lack of worth and fears of abandonment • Earlier experiences that forged those are targeted • Raging at therapist (or family member) for "not caring" comes from dysfunctional node being triggered • All the months of positive therapeutic experiences are in another network network - - not linked up. • At that moment the experiences aren't accessible - - they don't exist Inventory of Altered Self Capacities (Briere, 2004) • Relatedness • Interpersonal Conflicts; Idealization-Disillusionment; Abandonment Concerns • Identity • Identity Impairment; Self-Awareness; Identity Diffusion; Susceptibility to Influence • Affect Control • Affect Dysregulation; Affect Skills Deficits; Affects Instability; Tension Reduction Activities 

01:39:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So and that goes for family members too. Ever have experience with a family that's PPD? Where nothing, nothing is ever enough? Because as soon as those unprocessed memories get stimulated they're just coming from a totally different level. So here's an example of, ah, client who was treated with EMDR therapy and the evaluation was the inventory of altered self-capacity so you can see these different domains of relatedness, of identity, and of affect control. Now, the woman had been molested, abused also by other family members, ah, her husband who she had married and, ah, cheating on her, that was the adult contribution that finally you know, got her into therapy. But she had a whole range of experiences that had to be dealt with. The background is that the therapist had worked with her with conventional talk therapy, psychodynamic therapy for two years. And they had gone to the point where she accepted that yes, she had been molested and it wasn't her fault, okay. We got that. It felt it was as far as they could go. So they terminated with you know, the door is open, you can always come back but it's basically over. There's nothing else that could be done. She gotten to that point. And then during the time of this break, between the termination, ah, at-- the termination of therapy, the clinician have learned EMDR therapy. And so suddenly she gets a call from the client saying, "you know, I, I know it's my fault but I'm still doing this stuff I've always been doing. And my husband is threatening to divorce if I don't stop." Because the amount of raging she was doing in him, all the interpersonal stuff as, so they already had a relationship, the therapist and the client. So they brought the client back in, did a safe place that one of the techniques we have, that safe place exercise gave her the ability to be able to stay present with the processing.

01:42:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And here is the result of 20 sessions of processing. Starting out on that, uhm, Inventory of Altered Self-Capacities you can see-- this is even after the two years of previous therapy. She was clinical all the way across the board. Then you see after 20 sessions of processing these early memories she's sublinical and it's maintained as follow up and has continued to be maintained. As a matter of fact, she and he husband wanted to, uhm, be interviewed for, for my book in order to let people know that they should actually-- things can actually work. They feel they are in love again actually for the first time because their-- all of this pain that they had gone through during these years was now able to be processed so they are actually able to connect. So, again, the amount of preparation needed depends upon the need of the client. The amount of memories that have to be processed, dependents-- depends upon in the need of the client. This is 20 processing sessions as opposed to the previous eight. For some, you may need more, okay. It depen-- so that's what you're looking at. 

01:43:35
Results of 20 EMDR Processing Sessions of BPD Patient - - IASC Scales and Subscales Pre-EMDR Treatment Post-EMDR Treatment 7-Month Follow-up Clinical Cut-off IASC Scales and Subscales Brown & Shapiro, 2006 "Now look what you've done!" Amy • Amy was 11-year-old living her adoptive parents and her 13-year-old brother, also adopted. • Suffered from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. • She was adopted at age 2 by an older single mother in the U.S who die when A, y was 4. • New adoptive parents brought Amy to therapy. • Amy didn't talk until she was almost 5, was impulsive and easily distracted, and was diagnosed with ADHD and learning disabilities. • She had been on ADHD medication from age 5, and her parents said it calmed her somewhat, but they complained that Amy remains verbally and physically reactive and aggressive towards her brother and classmates. • She was argumentative, defiant, and oppositional with her parents and teachers. • Amy's parents complained that she had poor social skills and no friends. • EMDR was used to reinforce positive feelings of closeness between Amy and her parents, and was used to help Amy process feelings of grief related to the death of her first adoptive mother. • She also processed feelings of grief and sadness with EMDR related to what she knew about her abandonment by her biological mother and her first two years in orphanage care. • EMDR was also utilized to reprocess current triggers for reactivity at home and school, and to reinforce future templates related to positive social skills. 

01:43:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And ultimately, we have to go back to these early life experiences that people have had and recognize the kind of results on the system that may have been there. So here's a treatment of the child. Amy was 11 years old living with her adoptive parents and her 13-year-old brother was also adopted. She suffered from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. She was adopted as two-- at two by single mom, uhm, but who died when Amy was 4. And then the new adoptive parents brought Amy into therapy. She didn't talk until she was five, she was impulsive, easily distracted, was diagnosed with ADHD and learning disabilities. And just let me segway here a moment. The amount of children that are being medicated and misdiagnosed with ADHD and what they really have a traumatic responses, the lability-- the inability to concentrate is a part of these unprocessed memories. So you can actually have many clients come in with that label that do not need medication for the rest of their lives, what they need is some memory processing. Okay, back. She had ADHD, medication maybe 5 and it calmed her somewhat but complained she remain, ah, verbally and physically reactive and aggressive to her brother and classmates, argumentative, defiant, oppositional. She had no plot friends, ah, poor social skills. Now, these are parents that are trying their best with this adoptive child but can you imagine also the effects on the parents here, of ability and the feeling of hopelessness in terms of their giving love but it's not enough. So EMDR was used to reinforce the positive feelings of closeness between Amy and her parents and to process the feelings of grief related to death of a her first adoptive mother. This was done in conjunction with family, therapy and EMDR working with on the relationship when Amy's processing and you'll see it in a moment. Her mom is in the room with her, giving her the support and the closeness. Ah, processed feelings of grief and sadness related to what she knew about her abandonment by her biological mother and her first two years in the orphanage. And was used to reprocess current triggers for reactivity as home and school and reinforce future template. 

01:46:10
Assessment Phase • Image: Being bullied in class • Negative Cognition: I can't stand it • Positive Cognition: I can handle it • Emotion: Mad • SUD: 7 • Physical Sensations: In head Wesselmann, 2013 

01:46:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, here will being-- Amy is being treated for memory of being bullied in class. She can't stand sitting next to this guy, as the guy continuous to bully her. And I remember part of her assessment was that she was being reactive and aggressive with her brother and with other classmates. So, you know, you have an interactive process going on. The negative belief she has is, I can't stand it. The positive she believes she wants is I can handle it. The emotion that's coming with her as being mad has seven SUD levels, zero to 10, okay seven. And physical sensations in the-- in my head, ah, in her head. So, while pro-- continue processing of the earlier memories so that, that reactivity no longer exist. You see, the message here is that it doesn't matter how young, you can also make those appropriate connections. 

01:47:10
RESULTS of Treatment • On the Attachment Disorder Scale-Revised, Amy improved significantly, moving from attachment disorder to a nonclinical score. • On the CBCL, Amy moved from a T-score of 70 (high clinical score) to 62 borderline nonclinical. • Although she continues to show attentional problems and impulsivity, Amy's verbal and physical aggression towards her brother and classmates was eliminated. She was more pleasant and cooperative with her parents. She had more friends at school and her grades improved 

01:47:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO You can get to an understanding of what they do and you're also through the overall treatment changing a wide range of symptomatology, ah, on the attachment scale from this-- from the treatment going down to a nonclinical of borderline, ah, nonclinical score going to a 62 and 62 is the borderline-- is the nonclinical. Although she continued to show attentional problems and impulsivity potentially actual ADHD. Amy's verbal and physical aggression towards her brother and classmates as eliminated after treating-- after this part of a treatment. She was more pleasant, cooperative parents, more friends in school, you know, and so-- saying that reactivity whatever it is in terms of relationships, taking it to to the memories that are pushing the negativity can allow the shifts to take place.

01:48:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here is the difference in attachment scores, 12, 12 months of treatment. So issues of attachment, long-- ah, a big history, ah, literature on maternal bonding and there-- the inability for mothers to bond has been related to experiencing negative events within two years before the child's birth. And also they associate with traumas having to do with the birth process itself. So evaluating that, ah, ah, with how-- ah, how did you feel the first time you held your baby? Mothers who are bonding talk about the excitement, the love, the connection. Mothers who have not bond and talk about the fear, confusion or that they didn't feel anything. So processing the earlier traumas contributing to it, processing the birth experience, having imagine, ah, ah, a comfortable birth. The mother is now able to bond and very interestingly the article that was published on this was with moms whose children, young children has asthma. Once the bonding, EMDR therapy list was complete, if the child was young enough, the asthma disappear. That interaction in terms of that level of stress was no longer there. What was showing up now somatically with the children was gone. So this is the kind of thing that we need very, ah, to be able to explore. 

01:49:45
Attachment Scores Score throughout Tx Clinical cut-off 25 Wesselmann, 2013 Issues of Attachment • Madrid, 2007 Maternal Bonding • "How did you feel the first time you held your baby?" • Experiential contributors within two years of pregnancy • Wesselman, 2007 and 2013 • Attachment Style • Processing of experiential contributors Effects of psychotherapy on hippocampal volume on out-patients with post-traumatic stress disorder: a MRI investigation The treatment comprised with BEP with 16 weekly individual hypnosis of 45-60 min each. Lindauer colleagues assessed the efficacy of brief eclectic psychotherapy (BEP) on hippocampal volume and on PTSD symptoms of 9 PTSD subjects and found that smaller hippocampal volumes did not change after efficacious psychotherapy, even while symptoms were resolved. NO EFFECTS Neuroanatomical changes after Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Treatment in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) 

01:49:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO There are differences that are going on, ah, with some therapies. We, we have a clear indication that PTSD sper-- PTSD causes the shrinkage in hippocampal volume. The assessments of certain therapies have show no change after treatment. And again, we might be-- this was one that included that, ah, exposure therapy. Again, the difference might be that, that original memory is still stored intact and still having its negative effects. But the effect with EMDR therapy on shows an increase hippocampal volume. Here was one client who was the, ah, son of a bipolar mother. So you can imagine the types of adverse life experiences he had. He had went-- at this assessment as an adult and atrophied left hippocampus which gained 11, uhm, ah, percent over the course of treatment after EMDR. The message being that, ah, we don't have to leave anyone behind just because there's negative neurophysiological effects doesn't mean it's permanent. It can change. There is neuroplasticity. 

01:51:05
The Study: Phase 1 Hippocampal volume Repeated measure ANCOVA with side (left vs. right hippocampal volumes) as the repeated factor, and total brain volume as covariate showed that the hippocampal volume was smaller in PTSD patients than in control subjects (F = 12.53, d, f = 1 .15 p = 003) These results indicate PTSD subjects have smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects The Study: Phase 2 RESULTS PTSD Subjects CLINICAL DATA EMDR treatment is associated with a rapid improvement in PTSD symptoms and an increase in hippocampal volume 

01:51:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's another that was done, uhm, indicating that their PTSD subjects do have shorten hippocampi and the EMDR treatment resulted as you can see, ah, after 12 sessions here and increase in 12%?. So these are important factors that we're looking at because initially, years ago when it was first announced that shorten hippocampus was part of PTSD, people-- lots of folks were saying, well then that's it. Teach him occupational therapy in the veteran system in a VA because if its neurophysiological it's not gonna change but they discovered they were wrong it can change. And I would submit that regardless of what diagnosis might identify certain neurophysiological changes that correlate with that diagnosis. It doesn't mean it's permanent, it can mean that it can change. 

01:52:05
Redefinition of "Trauma" • Mol et al. (2005) • "Life events can generate at least as many PTSD symptoms as traumatic events." • "For events from the past 30 years the PTSD scores were higher after life events than after traumatic event." • Obradovic et al. (2010) • "A substantive of work has established that environmental adversity can have a deleterious effect on children's functioning" • "Exposure to adverse, stressful events...has been linked to socioemotional behavior problems and cognitive deficits" See also Research List AIP-Trauma and other adverse life experiences as the basis of pathology • The innate information processing system becomes overwhelmed due to high arousal and stores the experience in memory in unprocessed form. • Afifi, T.O., et al. (2002). Physical punishment and mental disorders: Results from a nationality representative US sample. Pediatrics, 130 DOI: 10.1542/peds.2011-2947 • "Harsh physical punishment [i.e., pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping, hitting] in the absence of child maltreatment is associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse/dependence, and personality disorders in a general population sample."

Childhood trauma and children's emerging psychotic symptoms: A genetically sensitive longitudinal cohort study. Am J Psychiatry, 168, 65-72. "Trauma characterized by intention to harm is associated with children's reports of psychotic symptoms. Clinicians working with children report early symptoms of psychosis should inquire about traumatic events such as maltreatment and bullying." 

01:52:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And we also have to look a redefinition of trauma because the criterion A events you need to diagnose PTSD. Studies now clearly indicate that general life experiences can cause more traumatic symptoms than major trauma. So clients that are coming in that are getting treated with medication, and not being recognized that what they have is PTSD simply because they've never been raped, they've never been in war and the clinician doesn't know enough to ask about these adverse life experiences that can occur. And there's a substantial literature that shows that adverse life experiences been linked socioemotional behavioral problems and cognitive deficits. I'm gonna give some other examples. And again, we're saying that the innate information processing system becomes overwhelmed because of arousal. These early memories gets studied in unprocessed form. Harsh physical punishment in the absence of child mal-- more severe child maltreatment is associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorder, substance abuse and dependence, personality disorders in a general population. These are adverse life experience which from an EMDR therapy lands these memories are stored unprocessed. Childhood trauma and children's emerging psychotic symptoms, trauma associated with intention to harm is associated with children's onset of psychotic symptoms. So clinicians need to inquire about who entered the verbal abuse or peer bullying. Again, this pushing psychotic symptoms and you already saw the results with this EMDR therapy treatment of these memories in reducing, ah, the psychotic symptoms themselves. Hurtful words, just hurtful words, ah, resulting elevated psychiatric symptom scores and corpus callosum abno-- abnormalities. Thus, this is parental verbal abuse, etcetera. 

01:54:15
AIP • Teicher, M.H., Samson, J.A., Sheu, Y-S Polcari, A. & McGreenery, C.E. (2010).Hurtful words: Association of exposure to peer verbal abuse and corpus callosum abnormalities. AM J Psychiatry, 167, 1464 - 1471 • "These findings parallel results of previous reports of psychopathology associated with childhood exposure to parental verbal abuse and support the hypothesis that exposure to peer verbal abuse is an aversive stimulus associated with greater ratings and meaningful alterations in brain structure." Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Study • Examined over 17,000 adult patients in the system "... found a strong dose-response relationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes of death in adults." • Conditions include: alcoholism, drug abuse, severe obesity, depression, suicide attempts, ischemic heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, skeletal fractures, and liver disease. • The implications for both medical and psychological treatment are relevant to both prevention and remediation. 

01:54:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And this one is so important for all clinicians to know. The Kaiser Permanente study, Felitti et al published in '98. And it was ignored, it was completely ignored, only now it is beginning to get the recognition that there was a strong dose relationship between the breadth of exposure into abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes of death in adults. Conditions include alcohol, substance abuse, severe obesity, depression, suicide attempts, ha-- heart disease, cancer, lung disease, skeletal fractures and liver disease. All of these associated, the more negative adverse life experiences that the individuals had in childhood the greater the likelihood of them developing one of these conditions. So the implications for not only treatment but prevention that if we can educate clinicians to see the impact and treat these memories that are negatively stored, getting them handled, young, they won't grow up to develop these diseases and these conditions. So the again the awareness is when the person walks in the door, are you doing client history to evaluate that full comprehensive range of negative experiences that they may have had.

01:56:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Uhm, addiction, looking at the experiential contributors of addiction whether it's gambling, sexual addiction, molestation, what-- whatever might be giving that high arousal, that calm-- that keeps him. Here is the, ah, outcomes for a drug court program, ah, done with EMDR therapy. Treatment is usual, the graduation rate is usually associated with lack of, ah, positivism. And they are not around the 50% level across the country in terms of the amount of graduation rate. And this program, treatment is usual resulted in a 55-- ah, 55% adding in seeking safety which was a preparation education, uhm, manual from a manual written by Nachowitz resulted in a 62, ah, rate. Adding EMDR therapy onto that resulted in the 91.3 graduation rate. Again, because it's going back to process what are the earlier memories that are driving the negative affects that are causing the people to need, to self medicate. And there's a long-- a big literature now that shows a trauma, substance abuse, relationship, but please again remember this adverse life experience, this childhood experiences that don't race the level of trauma are extremely important, for instance one of the, ah, clients who has continued relapsing over and over again and she had been molested, and she had, had the molest treated you know, years ago and she continued to relapse. When they use the, the techniques, EMDR technique in order to identify what's the earlier memories are pushing it, it turned out that when she was 4 years old, her parents were both alcoholics who got modeling in there as well. Ah, dropped her off at a park with her 2-year-old sister and told her to take care of her 2-year-old sister. She's 4 years old. She was so anxious. She was so upset. She started crying hysterically when, when thy went having panic attack. They came back, saw how upset she was, started making fun of her. That's what got left in as 4-year-old and that feeling of anxiety, terror, shame, is what continued to push her the need to self-medicate once that memory was processed the relapsing stopped. So it's very important if you're working with folks in this category that you look for that full range of experiences that can be pushing it. And that's why I have a problem with the latest DSM diagnosis that now has PTSD out of the anxiety disorders that's okay into a category that says trauma and stress related disorders, however, the other stress related disorders, all these adverse life experiences are now thrown into adjustment disorder. So that notion, why can't you adjust, why haven't you ju-- that seems to me to perpetuate that feeling for many clients. It shouldn't have affected me so badly, none sense. Overwhelmed the information processing system as a child locked into your memory networks, that's what's pushing it. It has the same effect as these major traumas.

Run the movie • "While holding the positive belief about yourself in mind, run the movie of the situation as you would like to be able to respond, from beginning to end. Let me know if there is any part or parts of the movie that are uncomfortable or challenging." 3. Reprocess as needed to VOC=7 Dual Awareness • Past and Present - - Trauma and BLS • Trauma and Present Safety • Accessing information as it is currently stored • Noticing images, thoughts, emotions, sensations as they arise • Thoughts, emotions, sensations are components of the stored memory and those in response to it • CBT focuses on the reaction to the memory • EMDR focuses on both the reaction and the memory itself Neurobiological correlates of EMDR monitoring - An EEG study Pagani et al. (2002). PLoS One EEG readings pre/post and during EMDR therapy sessions and in comparisons with controls Conclusions: "Our findings point to a highly significant activation shift following EMDR therapy from limbic regions with high emotional valence to cortical regions with higher cognitive and associative valence." 

02:00:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So just part of, of being sensitized to what we're looking at. Three-pronged approach again is identifying past, present and future. The future template for teaching someone something new is identify a future situation based on a recent experience and, uhm, a positive a belief that, that I would like to have. Hold that in mind. This is after the processing complete so they can access the positive. It's also of they-- you need to teach them a skill like standing up for themselves. You're teaching them how to do it through role pa-- play etcetera. Then you have them imagine doing it and then you have them-- then you process it while they imagine doing it and that allows it to encode in memory. The, the dual awareness that the person has of noticing the thoughts etcetera that are coming up. The neurobiological correlates show that there's a significant shift in EMDR therapy from limbic with high emotional valence to cortical regions with higher cognitive and associative valence. And the, ah, articles are, are listed in that, ah, online treat-- ah, list that you have so you can see difference in activation patterns.

Among the many contributors to be behavioral problems in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability are those of traumatic experiences. As such, behavioral problems can be seen as a reflection of these traumatic experiences... James IDD/PTTSD • Sexually abused one year previously by caretaker: threats with scissors and a knife, culminating in intercourse • Symptoms included flashbacks, nightmares, anger, outbursts, avoidant behaviors, frequent startle responses, sexual obsession, and self-hitting, acute fearfulness, lack of focus, loss of ability to enjoy activities, sadness, bouts of crying, preoccupation with death and suicide. • Prior to the abuse events James has experienced a number of painful events including head injuries, frightening medical treatment, being laughed at by teachers, and teased by peers. Barol & Seubert, 2010 

02:01:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Epilepsy, ah, intellectual visibility, all being associated with, ah, greater, ah, behavioral problems, ah, and they're seen as a reflection of the traumatic experiences. So here is just, ah, the aftermath of a treatment of James who had, ah, IDD and PTSD. He was sexually abused one year previously by a caretaker, ah, threaten with scissor and knife. The symptoms included flashbacks, nightmares, anger outbursts, avoidant behaviors, sorrow response, sexual obsession, self-hitting, acute fearfulness, lack of focus, loss of ability to enjoy activities, sadness, bouts of crying, preoccupation, death and suicide. And you also has a number of, ah, frightening medical treatments previously. So in 12 sessions, all the symptoms were eliminated and message is nobody needs to be left behind. Yes, we alter protocols appropriately for the developmental age could be the chronological age if it’s a child or in this case for the developmental age so that the processing is done accordingly so that it may take and then but do you see the difference in recognizing that we just don't have to assume that people have to suffer because they're untreatable, it simply isn't so. 

02:03:25
EMDR Treatment and Prevention Including Consecutive Day Treatment • Unprocessed memory etiology of most psychopathology • Impact of natural and manmade disasters • Intergenerational effects • Ongoing ethnopolitical violence 

02:03:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And the con-- the, the thing I also would like get across is that if we're saying that most are-- that unprocessed memories are the basis, ah, of most psychopathology. We also have to look at the impact of natural and manmade disasters and the intergenerational effects and the ongoing effects of ethnopolitical violence. In other words, outside the United States, what's going on out there and inside the United States the, the Sandy victims, the Katrina victims, the 9/11 victims right? What's happened in the Philippines. Well, these people didn't ask for these disasters to happen, but can you imagine the amount of, of mothers and fathers who have posttraumatic stress disorder from these terrible events. 

02:04:15
Trauma and Child Maltreatment • "Maternal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression in Pediatric Primary Care: Association With Child Maltreatment and Frequency of Child Exposure to Traumatic Events" Chemtob et al. (2013) JAMA Pediatr. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.2218 • Madrid, A., Skolek, S., & Shapiro, F. (2006). Repairing failures in bonding through EMDR. Clinical Case Studies, 5, 271-286. • Important implications worldwide. Earthquake in Mexico 1 Session (85 to 120 minutes) Mean Impact of Event Scores 12 week follow-up - despite aftershocks (Jarero et al., 2011) Massacre One session: 90-120 minutes Jarero & Uribe, 2012 

02:04:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Now, look at the latest literature on that. Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and depression is associated with child maltreatment. They don't wanna maltreat their child but they're so aroused. You saw the limbic thing, so aroused, that they're primed. The crying of their child's gonna make them anxious, any issues that the child has their, their lives to be pushing away. So, we-- what we have because of the EMDR you don't need homework to be effective is you can give extended sessions or consecutive day sessions, post disaster. So here you have the effects in a randomized trial of, ah, one extended session of EMDR therapy. See the difference between the wait list and the original treated group then they were treated, and they also became asymptomatic that's what the 12-week follow up despite the aftershocks. Here's another of a recent event of people, field work was being asked to go in and dig up and handled by from a massacre and you can see the difference. The bottom line, the sooner we can treat, more effectively we can treat. Again, this one session. 

02:05:35
Treatment on Consecutive Days • Teams of therapists for short term field work • Complete therapy in days not weeks or months • War front • Disaster response • Remote areas with few mental health workers • Highly disturbed clients of all kinds 

02:05:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO We have the ability to go in and do consecutive day treatment in field teams for those, ah, clinicians can treat within three days or with one extended session. All of these folks or traumatized so it doesn't get transferred to a next generation also going back to the combat veterans. There's consecutive day treatments that are being done with from one, two, three deployments treatment is finished in a week of consecutive day treatments for up to seven deployments the treatment is completed within, ah, within two weeks. And if you want more information on that, contact the Soldier's Center which is run by E. C. Hurley whose a retired colonel. He offers free treatment along with EMDR humanitarian assistance program to veterans and active military. 

02:06:35
Rape Victims Democratic Republic of the Congo • Co-operative project between Malteser NGO in the eastern section of the Congo and the Latest NGO in Israel, to assist women who had been raped. • Evaluation with Impact of Event Scale and Subjective Units of Distress Scale (0-10) • Variations used if women were unable to draw • Safe Place - "Think and draw something that gives you a good feeling" • Trauma Processing - Butterfly Hug and drawings • After two sessions women reported cessation of PTSD symptoms and pain in lower back (from rape) The House Palm Oil Tree Drawings of the State Place A Very Nice House Drawings During the Processing of the Trauma Fear A weapon for the combat How we fled and the others were dead. The refugees coming back and the new construction. 1-2 group sessions (Allon, 2010) Group 1 Statistics Szpunar et al., 2007 Remembering Envisioning the Future 

02:06:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's an example of group therapy treatment with rape victims, ah, in the Congo. What they were asked to do is identify a safe place with drawings and they then use, pick one and then they used, uhm, bilateral stimulation and something called the butterfly hug where they're doing self-simulation so you can work in groups. And here's an example of what that look like. And they work-- did with artwork, did first the safe place, reinforce that, then think about the original trauma, draw the picture. And here you have the weapon that was used in the combat the time they were raped doing another set, right? Now, let it go. Draw the next thing comes up, how we fled and others were dead. Concentrate on that and do it again. And then the last one you see, the refugees coming back, ah, in new con-- new construction. After two sessions, the women reported no more PTS, ah, symptoms. You can see the SUD level down. And they spontaneously reported an elimination of a back pain where they hold down at the time of the wait. So again, we have the ability, make sure that nobody gets left behind and recent research-- I mean research has indicated that if you want to project something in the future, you want to think of doing something in the future, it activates the same brain regions as thinking of doing something in the past. And the researchers said, their research indicated that in order to think of a future, you have to draw on your memories. Well, if your memory is-- are unprocessed, what kind of future can you envision? So the goal we have through are humanitarian assistance programs for instia-- instance is giving as much, ah, support as possible so that we can end up with the world where the connections can actually be made.

02:09:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:09:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Please get on the mike, yeah.

02:09:10
UNKNOWN I have a question. Uhm, I am a member of the association in Mexico and I'm blown away by the new stuff. First of all congratulations. But also, I was wondering-- I manage to loosen the microphone. Uhm, thank you. In complex PTSD, uhm, the requirements, what happens if someone doesn't satisfy. Have you ever had someone who doesn't satisfy all the requirements? 

02:09:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, we're looking at the preparation necessary to do that all-- and then for those that are extremely debilitated because the information, ah, the research is showing the one to three sessions on a single memory for highly debilitated clients early on in the therapy I would suggest more sessions in a week or morning and afternoon or the, the clean up in memories so then no longer being crumbled by it. 

02:10:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:10:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

02:10:15
UNKNOWN Anything, anything else? Is there, is there one that is less-- I didn't get them all, but there's one that's less important than others. 

02:10:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO No, you, you need to have a client who can feel in control during the processing. Do they need to be able to elicit a state change? That's what you're working on and so they can do that. 

02:10:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:10:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay? 

02:10:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:10:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yes. 

02:10:35
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

02:10:35
UNKNOWN Yes, thank you for your lecture, are there research, uhm, results from studies conducted with people diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder or sociopathic, psychopathic features, pathological lying, any of that? 

02:10:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO No, there aren't any randomized controls with that. And what we'd be looking at there, uhm, potential genetic factor maybe, ah, what are the earlier memories that are pushing that and, and the same way with the child molesters, what needs to processed and what needs to be incorporated. Some clinicians saying that childhood stories, fairy tales - 

02:11:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:11:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO - the positive morals etcetera that you actually have to teach the client cuz they didn't learn it. 

02:11:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:11:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

02:11:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

02:11:25
UNKNOWN Is there anything to be aware of when the original unprocessed events is nonverbal like proverbial and non-conscious? 

02:11:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, that's not a problem, it's stored implicitly. And if you-- and it might be stored before the client ever, ah, before the client developed visual so there isn't even an image. But the-- therefore, reason and the point is the memories are connected and associated. So you acts, you have them bring up a current situation where they were disturbed. You target that, though connections begin to get made and what you'll see is changes in physical sensation when they get to the proverbial level. So you can clean it up that way. 

02:12:10
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. 

02:12:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, yeah. 

02:12:10
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

02:12:10
UNKNOWN When you we speaking about the Van der Kolk, Prozac study, is there any contraindication to doing EMDR when someone's on an antidepressant medication? 

02:12:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO No, no the antidepressants, ah, there been a couple of studies now. There is no interference, the benzodiazepine is the only one that might run interference but the antidepressant is not and then what we're looking of is to win them off the medication and when they done that, ah, the results have stopped. 

02:12:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:12:35
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

02:12:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Sure. 

02:12:40
UNKNOWN For clients that have nightmares, night terrors and they don't remember what they are, uhm... 

02:12:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I'm sorry? 

02:12:45
UNKNOWN For clients that have nightmares, or night terrors but they don't remember the dreams, is there any indication or how likely it is that there some unremembered traumatic event? 

02:12:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yes, the-- for night terrors, and, and nightmares I would be looking at the earlier memories that are there. But if they don't remember the nightmares you can't do that image. I'm looking at the current situations, what's disturbing them using that with the flow of that technique to the earlier memories. Once you've processed the underlying memories, there are no more nightmares. 

02:13:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:13:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

02:13:20
UNKNOWN Excuse me, can I? 

02:13:20
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

02:13:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Oh, hi. 

02:13:25
UNKNOWN Ah, could you please tell us what about the, ah, memories like projected memories, things that never happened to those people? They have-- some of these people have projected memories and the second question is, what do you do when the SAT points doesn't go low? And what do you do when you get stuck, and, ah... 

02:13:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, the, the false memories you mean? 

02:13:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:13:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, it, it seems to be... 

02:13:45
UNKNOWN Not, not false memories but projected memories. Things that like a person hasn't lost the same but it feels like his-- he has lost this all but the same. 

02:13:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I'm, I'm not I'm sorry. I'm not hearing you maybe... 

02:13:55
UNKNOWN I'm saying people have projected memories, things that they have-- doesn't have, happened to them first... 

02:14:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, this, this called flash-forwards in the EMDR terms and what you're doing is you're directly targeting that. There's some studies that showing that directly targeting the, uhm, they fear of what's gonna happen in the future allows a good part of it to resolve. 

02:14:20
UNKNOWN So there's no-- I mean, reconsolidation of the memory because you can't really know whether the-- these things... 

02:14:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, you don't necessarily-- you couldn't find where it came from so you can do the projected memory, that projected fear. 

02:14:30
UNKNOWN And what do you do when you get stuck with the, ah, ill moments? 

02:14:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, there are standardized protocols that-- and procedures we used with EMDR therapy that if it get stuck, there are specific techniques that you use to, to, uhm, stimulate it again, bringing in the next bit of information that's needed called the cognitive interweave. And that's part of the training process and it's in the, ah, the-- my 2001 book is-- we have a description of... 

02:15:00
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

02:15:00
UNKNOWN Is there a relationship between the dominant feeling and the treatment of adulthood... 

02:15:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I think-- but let's finish up and I'll talk to you afterwards, okay. 

02:15:10
UNKNOWN Ah, okay. 

02:15:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Ah, yes. 

02:15:10
UNKNOWN Uhm, you mentioned that trainings I know there's a lot out there so I'm just wondering if there's, uhm, a way to make sure you're getting the proper training - 

02:15:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Sure. 

02:15:20
UNKNOWN - or a way to verify you know, - 

02:15:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. 

02:15:20
UNKNOWN - if somebody doing it right, ah... 

02:15:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, yeah, the, the EMDR International Association is the organization that set standards and practice for North America they're actually in the booths the-- down at the, ah, you know, at the convention center down at-- uhm, they have evaluated the different programs and they have to meet certain standards which include, there are certain amounts of practice sessions where you're given, receive it, how many trainers. It like one to nine ratio of but-- trainer to participants. So, and exactly one needs to be in it. So that's for North America, check them with them and make sure the training meets those standards. In Latin America there's an, ah, Iberoamérica EMDR Association. In Europe there's an EMDR Europe Association, in Asia an EMDR Asia and each one set standards for their region. So it is-- thank you bringing that up. It's really important you get well trained cuz as you saw the validity of how well you're doing, fidelity to how you're doing the procedure is directly related to the outcomes you're gonna get. 

02:16:25
UNKNOWN So just real quick sigh-- so if, uhm, if the EMDRIA - 

02:16:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yes. 

02:16:35
UNKNOWN Certified.

02:16:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, yeah. 

02:16:40
UNKNOWN Thank you so much for everything you keep done-- with the trauma community. I've been to the HAP training and had some, uhm, advanced trainings with and grab it talking and all that but I still go back to a problem that I'm not really able to figure out and that is... 

02:16:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, when can I talk to you... 

02:16:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, okay. 

02:16:55
