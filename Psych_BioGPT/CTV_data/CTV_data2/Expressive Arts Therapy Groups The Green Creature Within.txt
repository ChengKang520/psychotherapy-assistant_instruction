JUDITH A. RUBIN My name is Judi Rubin and I began as an artist, then I trained to be an art teacher and eventually, somewhat accidentally became an art therapist after which I trained in psychoanalysis with adults and children and got a Ph.D., in psychology. When I was first hired at the child guidance center, it was after being in the study group for a year which included a drama therapist named Elli Irwin. We decided to try working together in a group using both art and drama. We started out with a group of latency-age boys, boys between six and eleven. We had each seen them for an individual art and/or drama interview prior to selecting the kids for the group. When we thought it would work in a very straight forward way, they would make masks in art and then they would put them on and do a story and drama. The first session they came in and before we knew it, they had decorated the masks, put them up on their heads and started finger painting and then a spontaneous drama happened. And we thought okay, there goes the lesson plan out the window. We have materials for expression of both modalities, let’s see what happens and that’s how the group evolved. We would begin by gathering around the table, then the kids would go off and find whatever they wanted to work with individually or together. Sometimes they would make murals together, make up stories together. Then we would come back together at the end of the group and talk about it which was a very important part of the activity because it allowed them not only to express but to reflect. And when that group was over, we said, well, do you think we could do this with adolescents. So we solicited referrals. Again we saw them individually prior to selecting the members of the group. We invited a child psychiatrist named Guillermo Borrero who was in training at art clinic and who was also training in psychodrama with Elli at the time to work with us. Again we had the same phenomenon that we saw in the latency group. Again we tried to start out in a more structured manner. I think we had them introduce themselves with a picture the first week, but that was it. From then on, they really wanted to do it their way. They became very attached to the group. The group started out as one hour, then it was an hour and a half, then it was two hours because we really needed that much time for them to express themselves and then again as with the younger kids to sit and reflect on what had happened. It was very hard for them to end because it had become a home away from home. Remember these are teenagers and they are in a process of separation from families and so they need to attach themselves to peers in order to make that separation and when it was over, we thought that again we had taken some pictures. This time the kids took the pictures. They took a lot of stills, slides and we had a super eight (inaudible ) camera and a tripod all the time. So they could film each other and we thought well, this was a most unusual experience. At that point, very few people were mixing modalities and we thought it might be good to make a film to show other people how this works and so that’s how the green creature got made and the name of it comes from a painting by one of the fellows in the group that he called the green creature within. And in addition to seeing the group activities in this film, you will also see individual case studies. So you get a sense of change over time because we actually were filming from the beginning to the end of the group and that too was a hard thing to find. Now in addition to this film, on this DVD, we have clips, excerpts from other multimodal work, which became more comfortable for people over time. One is from a film about the work of Norma Canner who is a dance movement therapist and she uses art, as well as movement and sound, music in her work. The other is from another expressive arts therapist primarily dance movement, Carolyn Grant Fay who also uses more than one modality. The excerpt from her film shows how she integrates all of the arts into her work with the group. Both of these films, the one about Carolyn Grant Fay and Norma Canner were made by a very gifted young filmmaker Ian brownell and we are very grateful to Ian and to the owners of those copyrights for permission that excerpts from those films. Finally, there is an excerpt from a place called raw arts…

JUDITH A. RUBIN …kind of space that kids can feel comfortable in and flower in and also find themselves in and work on their issues and we thank them too, especially Kit Jenkins, one of the cofounders. We hope you will enjoy seeing the story of the Green Creature Within, the art drama therapy group that Elli and I did, as well as the other examples of multimodal work with the arts in therapy with adults and adolescents.

Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources “The Green Creature Within” Multimodality Group Psychotherapy with Adolescents Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center and Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic present THE GREEN CREATURE WITHIN… ART AND DRAMA IN GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY 

00:06:55
Two hours a week for two years, a group of adolescents came to the outpatient clinic of Pittsburgh Child Guidance Centre to be part of an expressive therapy group. Each had a different problem, each had a different label, but all were herding. To meet their different needs, we made available a wide range of flexible materials, which could be used in a variety of ways. We hoped that through the use of many different creative modalities, these adolescents might come to find, to know and to master what one member called that Green Creature Within. The explicit media made available included art, drama, poetry, music and dance, as well as photography. Super-8 movies and slides taken by the group members themselves were used to help these adolescents look at what was going on and to develop not just artistic but psychic perspective. 

00:08:05

00:08:15
Following the termination of the group, the therapists Judy Rubin an art therapist, Bill Borrero a child psychiatrist and Elli Irwin a drama therapist, decided that the group films although lacking in technical quality might have a different kind of appeal. The possibility of giving the viewer a glimpse into the life of the group over time and an awareness of how the arts can be therapeutic for every one. This film is a record for them, for us and for you of their two-year (inaudible ) in search of the Green Creature Within and of our efforts to make that journey therapeutically safe and productive.

Many different materials in many different modalities made multiple happenings possible, even in the same time and space. Members were comfortable flowing from one activity to another. In this case, from sculpting with Paris craft to dancing and moving and then back to work on the sculpting. And throughout all this yet another member watched and worked alongside. Another time, Sherry(ph) and her therapist were in one corner being doctor and patient in a drama. A few feet away others sat with another leader. At the end of the drama, doctor and patient rejoin the group and all talked together about their experiences. The group members used all of these creative opportunities and they used each other. Sometimes showing and helping, sometimes sharing the labor and sometimes even working on each others products. Side by side alone or with others they also made group projects, sharing space, ideas and materials and finding a sense of community. Because a camera was available for most sessions, many dramas were captured on film and then looked at and reflected upon. Sometimes these improvisations took place within one session. Like this one in which the group members stimulated each other in puppet making. Each puppet voicing the fantasies and fears of each group member about the gradual emergence of intimacy, sexuality and aggression. Other times emotionally loaded issues could more safely be explored and performed for the camera. This drama began several weeks earlier with a bar room brawl and in arrest and progressed to this point where the defense lawyer pleads to see his jailed client who ultimately will be brought to trial for the murder of her husband.

Talking directly about sensitive issues was often painful. For some like Matthew, it was easier to say things through poetry or in writing. For others like Sam even that was hard and his disguised messages were often in Russian or Chinese. For him it was easier to say things through pictures. One day, sensing Jim’s depression, Sam responded with empathy and concern by making a line drawing of him which Jim could sense and respond to. Through the symbolic avenues of art, we tried to help them communicate ideas and feelings. There were times when their abstract messages were repetitive like Sherry’s many containers with different size openings. Other symbols were less disguised like Marlene’s(ph) flax sculpture. Our task, however, was to help each person look at and find his own unique meaning in his own symbolic creation whether representation or not. Sherry said her abstract clay sculpture reminded her of her family. The members all stuck together. She made a south American dinosaur with its baby and later a wounded bird, hurt, bleeding and rejected. She seemed to identify with this pinion sad creature. She also made a lifesize sculpture endowing with the first name of her father and the last name of her male therapist. In time, it soon became a vehicle for the projections of other group members as well. Some of the art work was almost painfully eloquent such as Cindy’s two agonized faces made after witnessing in especially traumatic event. Marlene herself an abandoned child had recently had an abortion. For months she created, nursed and destroyed a series of symbolic babies, only then could she talk openly about the experience and her own feelings of loss. Such change took time and assumed different forms for different people. Sam had dropped out of school and had literally locked himself in his room. In the group, he began by isolating himself in a corner working on a series of brightly colored, organic, voluptuous paintings. During that period, his work in clay was equally undulating, soft and fluid. But gradually the work began to change. Extensions began to emerge, projections thrusting out and the paintings changed too. Clearly separated parts appeared, the shapes and colors becoming more varied and differentiated. Gradually he began to try other media like wood, which gave his creations even more form, greater stability and power. As though a structure was forming internally as well, Sam began in minute playful ways to display some of the anger he had always repressed. As he began to change, he spontaneously created a vivid, powerful drama, which seemed to represent the psychic awakening he was experiencing. Fearfully he covered, then retreated inside a womb like enclosure. Slowly but dramatically he emerged powerful enough to confront and challenge the therapist King Father and later the therapist witch mother. For the first time, he was able to express directly some of the aggressive competitive feelings he had locked away. Simultaneously his art work began to change. He began to move from abstraction to representation, sometimes making faces that were distorted and grotesque. perhaps reflecting some of his long repressed inner feelings. Change for Sam as for all was often slow with backward as well as forward movement over time. Becoming aware of all his feelings, happy as well as sad ones, he struggled to integrate this new found awareness of his inner life. 

00:17:15

00:17:20
One of his favorite creations was a powerful phallic head of a king, perhaps symbolizing the strength he was beginning to realize in himself. 

00:17:35

00:17:40
Jim, often depressed, had a hard time expressing himself in the group. 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:17:55
His first pictures were of heroes, but they were usually incomplete. Almost all of the powerful athletes were missing parts of their bodies; sometimes an arm, sometimes a leg, and sometimes body parts were subtly cut off by the edge of the paper. For many sessions, he worked on an elaborate drawing of omnipotent superheroes, like the Green Lantern and the Green Arrow, perhaps triggered by his feelings of vulnerability in the group. The same sense of helplessness was evident in his spontaneous play. He almost always ended up as a victim, or as the hurt or injured one. As the dental patient, he was so passive and wobbly, he kept tumbling to the floor, as though like a baby he was unable to sit without support. He had actually begun as the dentist in this drama, but unable to maintain the role, he soon switched to becoming the weak patient, who had to be tied in the chair. In the same way, he volunteered to be the tough cop, driving his police car, when all of a sudden he changed the script and again was hurt and injured. Rescued by the doctor, Jim seemed to enjoy the idea of being a patient even when put on the operation table. Without a murmur, he passively submitted to the aggressive doctor and her own primitive brand of anesthesia. Jim could give orders to his secretary and be a big shot. But he could not confront an angry employee whom he was actually supposed to fire, at least not until the employee had left the room. As Jim was taking his first tentative steps to express anger in his drama, his drawings began to change. More often, the drawings were more complete with few if any body parts missing. Trying other media, he made tall constructions and later went on to create phallic weapons like swords and daggers. 

00:20:20
[sil.] 

00:20:25
Showing his strength and growing sense of potency, he playfully lifted a heavy chair, said to weigh at least fifty thousand pounds. Becoming more comfortable with aggression, he played the role of a dominant male, bossing and ordering his wife around. He demanded special food, insisting that she instantly follow his commands. He had become quite a boss. 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:21:00
Having learned to express his aggression outward instead of inward, he experimented with many roles, sometimes using a powerful gun to protect himself against his supposed enemies. Full of courage, he even challenged the male leader to a dour(ph). 

00:21:20

00:21:25
When the leader showed Jim how to fight in slow motion, he was able to control his movements and still win the battle. 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:40
Savoring the pleasure of the experience he repeatedly came back for more and was thus able to master the anxiety about the once feared effects of his aggression. 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:22:00
Later, he could sit down with his former opponent and talk about it. A leader in a group of this kind must be flexible enough to play many different roles, most of the time observing, listening and responding empathically. There are times, however, that it may be in teaching skills or helping a group member with a task like helping Sherry make her paper-mache sculpture. It may also mean giving form to a drama, helping people take roles like being an MC in a night club scene. But with someone like Matt who doesn’t trust words, a leader may need to communicate nonverbally. In this case, through moving and dancing in synchrony. 

00:22:50
We may loose and we may win… though we will never be here again… So open up by climbing in… So take it easy.. 

00:23:05
With Jim the leader helped by joining him in a musical improvisation. It was also good for the group to have a leader join them in a scene at Joe’s bar and grill. Afraid of losing control of themselves, it helped them to see the leader modal a kind of playful yet controlled looseness, having a concrete example of what might be called regression in the service of the ego. Sometimes the leader actively taught another way of looking at one’s feelings like suggesting role reversal. As in this scene, in which the leader plays the psychiatrist listening to an angry and agitated patient and then switches roles with her. It helps if a leader can be spontaneous and playful being free to take whatever role a group members may require. But if a leader becomes involved, it must always be with an awareness of the effects and possible meanings of the intervention. Here, one of the therapists gives voice to Jim’s powerful aggressive impulses while the other speaks for his turn in punitive conscience, together they help him see and understand his conflicts about directing his aggression outward or turning it inward, should he shoot the girl who spurned him or turn the gun on himself. In helping him recognize the dilemma, the leaders help him to work toward resolution. Often, the dramas were playful, sometimes down right funny. In this improvisation Jim gobbled up bunches of French fries asserting that they were thermometers in a magical quest for phallic potency. The two doctors try to puzzle out the best course of treatment for such a fantasy. One doctor made several x-rays, which supposedly showed the thermometers inside the patient’s head. It was helpful to Jim that the leaders who were able to join in the spirit of his zany drama and to use their own creative resourcefulness to help him to deal with his wild fantasies. 

00:25:30

00:25:35
In all, there was in the group a variety of material which provided possibilities for work in many areas, expressing ideas and feelings in a variety of ways. 

00:25:50
Take it easy… Take it easy… 

00:25:55
There were leaders who were willing to look, listen, play, teach, take roles and to help in any way that might be needed. And most of all, there was a sense of fun, of joy, of playfulness which made it possible for members to react to each other in a natural way. There was a feeling of community in which the group members learned from each other and especially learned about themselves in their journey with the Green Creature Within.

At RAW, kids feel a sense of pride 

00:29:00
It was good to have done a project and have someone say, you did this, you created this all by yourself? It's beautiful. 

00:29:15
This… this painting is called, I look like my father. Even though I look like my father, I’m not really like my father. I mean, I make my own choices on my own such as like I go to school now, I go to job; two jobs actually. One here at RAW and one at the super stopper shop(ph) and then I mean, at first I didn’t think it wasn’t gonna come out that great. Now they take a second look at it, I realize it came out pretty good. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:45
At RAW, kids use art to face themselves and to face their feelings 

00:29:55
Sometimes I get really mad and I tend to throw things and you know break things because I can't express myself, so I just get angry at the objects. Doing my projects and paintings, I can express how angry I am by not showing how angry I am or how mad I am. I started out with making her just regular, you know it's the normal person but then I wanted to show my feelings and express how I felt you know. I never really made anybody this angry before I guess. She needs love, comfort and stability in her life. 

00:30:40
This person feels that she is like nothing and she hates herself, she is worth to die. 

00:30:45
What's really weird is that last year before I started coming to RAW that I really hated art and I thought it was stupid. Then now that I started coming here and I think that it’s just really important and I think that it's how it’s saved my life because like I paint at home too since I’ve started coming here and that like if I get into fight with my mom, I can just go in my room and paint and take my frustrations out on the paper in stead of just drinking or doing drugs like I were before and I think that it's just really awesome. 

00:31:25

00:31:30
What I’ve learned about myself is that I can draw and I can paint and that there are no mistakes that are too big to be fixed.

I saw problems in the school. I saw two kids fighting. So I went over and I talked to them. 

00:31:55
And I decided to help, you see, I have special powers. A special power we had was to protect them from any other bad that may come along. 

00:32:05
I can talk to the people and say why are you doing this? 

00:32:10
One day I was walking down the street and I saw those two kids that I’ve talked to before and now I saw them playing cards and I told them, hey that’s what I’d like.

00:33:00

When you say let go, to let go of what? 

00:33:55
Like I… I tend to what little things, espically things I can't do anything about, get to me and (inaudible ) and that’s what I want. Caron, if you could pick a word, but your big bag is saying would it be? 

00:34:15
I think it would be saying, actually I know it would be saying I’m confused and…

Carolyn Grant Fay is a Jungian movement therapist who uses all creative modalities in her work. 

00:35:05
CAROLYN GRANT FAY I like to start and end a group in a circle because all are equal in a circle and there is no beginning and no end. I’m gonna put some music on and let’s just move around and explore the space. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:25
CAROLYN GRANT FAY So just walk around… In a beginning group one needs to claim the space. So as a warm-up for the session, I have the students move around the room and then I have them experience the different qualities of movement in order to develop a full repertoire of movement possibilities. First they move in the spaces between people and then they brush pass and touching lightly, then staying with one person after another ending in a group relationship. In this warm-up practice, I suggest moving from the individual standpoint to the collective and back to the individual for the theme of the session. These particular people are coming together as a group for the first time, I chose clay as the medium because engaging with this material allows for expression of the body. Clay is primordial, it's matter, earth. Like drawing, painting and the center experience, working in clay can bring images from the unconscious into a physical form that they can be then consciously explored. I floored the room with a cover of light and play music to intensify the mood of the theme, really creating an appropriate environment in which to work. I chose to conclude our group work with the temper by the sea, which is a structure that can include the possibility of a transformative experience. Gradually come up to standing it’s dawn as you walk, imagine that you are leaving this room, you’re on your way to the seashore area of your psyche. 

00:37:15
CAROLYN GRANT FAY They go to an altar which represents the source in themselves. They made a vast person who is different for each individual, this vast one guides them through discernment, to the depths of their own being. They sprawled down counterclockwise into the deeper unconscious and just before entering that faithful place, they need to stop and make a sacrifice. Later they shared their experiences of the sacrifice in both words and drawings. 

00:37:50
CAROLYN GRANT FAY I have a hard time with the sacrifice. This room it just had the this huge what I thought was a tree trunk, which is one right straight up until I couldn’t even see the top of it and I was still kind of asking well what’s the sacrifice or something. This was going through my mind and nowhere somebody started chopping this tree down. And I was just horrified, it really was such a shock to me and that’s why I had to draw this and this huge tree I mean just it was gone and all this was left was this stone. The one thing I noticed is that it had the huge roots and that made me that was very comforting that had such enormous root. Then that the first thing I saw where just three little green leaves and I thought well there is life there you know and that’s fine and I was satisfied with that.

NORMA CANNER I thought it would be fun to begin with the instruments in the senses and what I’d like you to do is to go up there and look around and try different ones. 

00:39:30
NORMA CANNER And use it in a way that’s not the usual way you might play with it, in a nontraditional way. Explore the movement of shaping your body around it, getting the feeling of it on your face. It’s quite primitive in a way, the way a child would perhaps use it at a very early age exploring in its possibilities. So it’s new always new. In my workshop with teachers and therapists, I try to give them the opportunity to reconnect with that childlike sense of discovery because ultimately that’s how we learn and grow. When we use movement to re-experience those early developmental stages, it’s vital to build a sense of community and trust within the group because often this work can bring up feelings and memories that are disturbing.

NORMA CANNER Most of the movement exercises are to help people explore their interior moving into expressing through the visual modality by drawing, it takes us to another level, the naming. I want you to make a body map of everything that’s happened to you in terms of telling the story of what goes on in every part of your body. And so do it all over way, you had any kind of wound or hurt or memories, it would be good to put it down and then the ultimate thing is going to be you are going to make a short performance using dance, song, writing, drawing or something.

Playing creating (inaudible ) can be, no kids often play out things they are wondering about, it’s their way of trying to understand what has happened or what could happen like doctor play. Most kids have been poked then looked down and examined and maybe even hurt by the doctor. So it feels good to turn it around and be the doctor and do all those things to someone else being active instead of passive. Creating from past experiences and feelings, they project part of themselves into what they make.

Sometimes it’s even easier to take about feelings with puppets like feelings of affection as Shirley and Fay are doing. Kids have a lot of stories to play out too. Sometimes they’re funny stories like when Dana pretended to be a statue for sale in the store and Ralph began to argue about the price. Well, it was so funny that even Dana had a hard time to keep from laughing. 

00:44:25
$48 It should be $348.

I had a dream and it was so scary that it woke me up. While I was sleeping I heard that noise and it was like someone’s breaking glass, so I woke up and then I saw a man and he had a very long knife and then he saw me and he broke the window and he came to (inaudible ). 

00:45:07
Playing out dreams can be scary but if kids talk about it when it’s over, it helps to know that other people have scary dreams too and the dreams aren’t for real but they come from feelings inside and that it helps to talk about it. Of course it takes a special kind of grownup to play with kids this way. A grownup who can really listen a grownup who remembers what it’s like to be young to have all those thoughts and ideas and feelings and stories inside just waiting for a time and the place to be expressed.

00:46:25
[sil.] 

00:46:30
Two hours a week for two years a group of adolescents came to the outpatient clinic of Pittsburgh Child Guidance Centre to be part of an expressive therapy group. Each had a different problem, each had a different label but all were hurting. To meet their different needs we made available a wide range of flexible materials which could be used in a variety of ways. We hoped that through the use of many different creative modalities these adolescents might come to find to know and to master what one member called that Green Creature Within. The expressive media made available included art, drama, poetry, music and dance as well as photography. Super 8 movies and slides taken by the group members themselves were used to help these adolescents look at what was going on and to develop not just artistic but psychic perspective. 

00:47:35
Take it easy… Take it easy Don’t let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again So open up by… 

00:47:55
Talking directly about sensitive issues was often painful for some like Matthew it was easier to say things through poetry or in writing. Some of the art work was almost painfully eloquent such as Cindy’s two agonized faces made after witnessing in especially traumatic event. Marlene herself an abandoned child had recently had an abortion. For months she created, nursed and destroyed a series of symbolic babies only then could she talk openly about her experience and her own feelings of loss. A leader in a group of this kind must be flexible enough to play many different roles most of the time observing, listening and responding empathically. 

00:48:40
Bill Borrero Child Psychiatrist 

00:48:45
There are times however that it may be teaching skills or helping a group member with a task by like helping Sherry make her paper mache sculpture. There were leaders who were willing to look, listen, play, teach, take roles and to help in anyway that might be needed. And most of all there was a sense of fun of joy, of playfulness, which made it possible for members to react to each other in a natural way

00:49:15
There was a feeling of community in which the group members learned from each other and especially learned about themselves in their journey with the Green Creature Within.

00:49:55
As the family selects the puppets, the therapist observes their individual behaviors and their interaction. Some puppets are chosen immediately, others are rejected or avoided. The selection process provides the therapist with important clues about the dynamics of the family. The particular meaning that the puppet has for the person usually becomes clear through the interaction and conflict portrayed within the story as well as during the discussion after the story when each person is asked to think about which puppets they chose and why. 

00:50:30
ELLIE IRWIN How about introducing your puppets to everybody so all the puppets can have a chance to meet each other. 

00:50:40
Okay. My name is Ron. Good to see you. And this is duck, okay. 

00:50:45
ELLIE IRWIN I’d like you to take a couple of minutes and to try to think together of a way you could start a story using some of the puppets that you’ve got. 

00:50:55
Observing the formation of the story, it is often possible to determine family roles. Most families work best when hidden behind a puppet stage which provides psychic as well as aesthetic distance. 

00:51:10
Okay and all these creatures, some may look mean and they are all just like us, okay. 

00:51:20
Uh…Huh…

00:51:50
Okay. 

00:51:50
Okay sing a song. We all came back together, we brought everything back with us. 

00:51:55
When the story stops, the therapist can continue the interaction by talking directly to the puppets. 

00:52:05
ELLIE IRWIN If we could show you story to an audience on television for example, what could we tell them would be the moral of the story. 

00:52:10

At the western Pennsylvania school for blind children Jim Gardner and Roni Ostfield work with blind and partially-sighted children in a creative dramatics program. Spontaneous play can help to organize and make sense of the outer world as well as the inner world of feeling. At times improvisations are humorous that may also reflect underlying worries as in this unplanned drama.

For most children such experiences can be therapeutic, but some children need more specialized help. Trauma therapy focuses on the understanding and working through of conflicts.

Oh burned!

ELLIE IRWIN Now you have a burn due to bad things are happening to you. 

00:54:55
In the drama, feelings and fantasies are expressed and accepted as therapist and child work towards clarification, control and change. Puppet play and improvisation can be valuable diagnostic as well as therapeutic tools for children in their families.

But art, you say begin to explore and work in art, I think they can get that feeling of control back of having choices, their infinite choices in art and their dependency becomes less as they explore and create themselves.

We really didn’t know what was gonna happen. When we started we were told that the children had all kinds of problems, things that would make it hard for them to do what we expected them to do. We wanted to see what children like these could do when given art materials and offered freedom. And these weren’t just ordinary children. They were the kind of children that are called special or exceptional, which is a plight way of saying that they had a lot of things wrong with them they had labels like mentally retarded, brain damaged, cerebral palsied and the one label that all of them shared no matter [what 01:00:35]their other disability was that they were blind.

And then there was David who zoomed around the paper with marker, with brush who took all the energy he used to use to bite and pinch and kick and put it into his paintbrush and put it into his pictures.

DARCY LYNN Artist The first time I wanted to draw was in intensive care it would be when I was feeling more conscious and because I was sedated with a lot of stuff and I think it was more of the concern to see if I still had it in me and I could still do it, I could still do that drawing line that hadn’t been taken away. I think my heart really helped me because it was the only way I could hold on to my own identity and I think if I didn’t have that it would have been awfully difficult. To be treated for cancer is a long process and you need something, you need something to hold on to, that’s you. 

01:04:10
In work, which is true to both art and therapy, people are helped to find to know and to accept the true self which may be hidden within behind the masks they wear.

emi Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources CHILDREN AND THE ARTS A FILM ABOUT GROWING 

01:06:50
Children and the arts go together because the arts are way of picking what comes naturally to children and giving it form. We all know that kids like to move. 

01:07:10
[sil.] 

01:07:20
One of the most helpful things about the arts is that they give children ways of exploring and expressing and articulating those scary feelings. You might want to mess with your brother but it’s better if you mess with the fingerpaint and you might feel like pounding your sister but it’s a lot safer to pound a drum. The angry feelings can go into a story too. The killing is made (inaudible ) and that makes it safe. The punch that can hurt can become a dance, it can become so highly stylized and ritualized that it becomes a thing of beauty and so those scary angry messy feelings can be turned from the arts into something lovely. Now the same fellow who has two puppets so angry at each other can also have two puppets who feel very loving toward each other because children have all sorts of feelings inside them. And the child who begins to feel good because he knows how to do something, feels even better he has found some grownup who believes in his ability and who believes in him as a person who shows him that he likes him just the way he is and that good happy feeling is the feeling the children can get in the arts from finding out what they can do and learning how to do it. Feeling strong and proud and really good about themselves and in the process of growing.

01:09:50
These 4-year-old children are choosing parts of themselves that they want to explore by beginning with an experience with each part one at a time they are gradually moving into a ritual consciousness of their bodies. The first awareness of self for every human being comes through the mother’s touch and through the close contact with her body. Thus the first sense of self is the body sense awakened by the mother’s care. This in turn encourages each child to explore his own body beginning in infancy and continuing as he grows. When I first met Amy and Deborah two of the children I worked with individually they were psychotic in the autistic stage of development. They like the young infant spent all their time stimulating themselves. Their autistic gestures were ritualistic, highly stylized patterns of movement. Communication was then only possible in one way through our bodies. Since their tiny limited worlds were intensely physical, I tried to enter their worlds and speak their language by reflecting their movements. In the beginning this was simply direct imitation. By doing what she was doing I was trying to tell her that I liked her just the way she was without asking anything of her. I wanted her to know that she was safe to be completely herself then when she was ready we could begin to share. 

01:11:15
[sil.] 

01:11:25
Each child within the safety of the room and situation had I think begun to trust me. Up to now she had permitted to touch but not enough to relax and become passive like a baby. Both girls were now on the earlier stage of symbiosis and spent most of their time wanting to be held. Perhaps it was at this point that they had begun to experience themselves as one of two people in a relationship and could then begin to grow and go through some crucial phases of normal development which they missed the first time around. These children then began to explore my body just as the normal child begins to explore the mother’s body. Mutual trust did now exist at the body level. It was beginning to look like a normal relationship. 

01:12:15
[sil.] 

01:12:35
If these adults have reached a better understanding of themselves in relation to their own bodies perhaps their words and actions can be more honestly reflective of what they really mean, perhaps then there will be fewer difficulties in communicating with each other and with the children in their lives. After working with children in varying degrees of mental illness, I have learned that body language can be the first means of successful communication. Sometimes it can also be the basis from which verbal communication can grow. We can provide opportunities in which they can be themselves follow their internal rhythms and discover that their bodies can come alive through movement. Their bodies can then become a beautifully natural part of their speaking of their listening, of their moving and growing through a time and space called childhood.
