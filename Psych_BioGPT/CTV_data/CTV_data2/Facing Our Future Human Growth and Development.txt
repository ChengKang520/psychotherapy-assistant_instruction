Dr. Tom Sweeney COUNSELOR EDUCATOR 

00:00:40
DR. TOM SWEENER  We have tended to be a youth oriented society. As a consequence, human development in middle and later years remains a new frontier for both research and practice. In fact, only recently has the counseling profession begun to focus on the counseling needs of older persons. In an interview with the founding president of the Association for Adult Development and Aging, Dr. Jane Myers, she talked about the current state of human development theory and practice in gerontological counseling. 

00:01:10
Dr. Jane Myers GERONTOLOGICAL EXPERT 

00:01:10
DR. JANE MYERS Frankly, there hasn't been enough time to provide the information that counselors need to work effectively with persons in their later years. Most of our human development theories apply to development of the young persons, persons, ah, particularly under the age of 18 but maybe up through college in one span of vocations. We know very little about the development of persons as they get into midlife and beyond. Most of the theories that deal with late life development are very global. Erickson's theory is a good example. He talks about achieving generativity during midlife and then achieving ego integrity during the later years. And the later years could be as much as 20, 30, 40 year, 50 years whereas if you look at the theories for younger persons, you may have a period of three to five years with seven or eight highly significant developmental tasks. Those kinds of theories have not been written to help counselors help older persons. What we have instead are some emerging theories of adult development that focus either on early to midlife adult development with some kind of an indication that later on some things happen that we don't know a whole lot about. And we also have theories that deal with transitions. And transition theories, of course, can be applied at any stage and lifespan. And they are effective tools for counselors to use in working with older persons because they experience so many significant transitions. 

00:02:30
DR. TOM SWEENER Two counselors are currently involved in full time direct service to older persons. And yet in the next decade, even fewer counselors will be able to say that they never have older adults as clients. In fact, because of the unprecedented number of persons living longer, many of us will be among that older population in the future. As Dr. Myers pointed out, we have much to learn and do in the coming years if the quality of life for older persons is to improve. In many respects, human development is the keystone for preparation in gerontological counseling. And yet there are probably more myths than there are facts about adult development particularly in the later years. For example, most current textbooks on human development use about 80 percent of their space to discuss the years before age 18 with the remaining 20 percent of coverage devoted to the adult years which now comprises about three fourths of an average person's lifespan. Even the popular book passages describes development only through the middle years. In this program, we want to help to spell some of the myths about the later stages of life while conveying some of the facts such as they exist at this time. We'll also a little straight from interviews with older adults how we can use our knowledge of human development in counseling relationships. Dr. Myers, whose research and prolific writing in the field of gerontological counseling is internationally recognized, offered these observations about the myths and facts related to human development in later life. 

00:04:00
DR. JANE MYERS One of the, ah, more highly studied areas of gerontology has been that of attitudes towards older persons. In fact, most of the studies have found that the prevalent attitudes towards older people in this country are very, very negative. The good news, of course, is that it's changing within the last few years. That has started to change. But for the past 20 years, all of the studies uniformly have shown that most people look at older people in a negative light. And part of the underlying reason for that is all of these myths and stereotypes we have about older people. We believe, and I say "we" meaning people in general, its common knowledge that, ah, older persons decline intellectually. We have the clichés, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. And that's a, a cliché. It's common knowledge. We believe that older people can't learn. And, of course, that's not true. Some of the recent studies have shown that intelligence does not decline with age, that older people are capable of learning. Reaction time may slow. They may need different learning, learning methods, different teaching styles. But they can learn equally, as well. There is an assumption among employers that older persons are unproductive workers, that they're absent more, that, uhm, it's difficult to teach them new things, that they're rigid. And all of that's proven to be untrue. Some of the employers in the country, fast food chains, for example, have began hiring older workers. And they have remarkably successful programs. IBM and the Polaroid Corporation, a lot of the major companies nationally are finding that if they can hire older workers, they have workers who are more loyal to their companies, who have higher attendance records, who really work hard, who value and like their jobs. And many of them also are now trying to retain their older employees. They're finding they have a wealth of knowledge and they don't want to lose them. So they're looking for ways to keep them employed. So we have job sharing where two employees may share one job or we have two part time jobs instead of one fulltime job. There are partial retirement programs where employees can try part retirement for a while. If they don't like it, they can keep working. Or they can take time off for six months or 12 months and then come back to work again so the employers don't lose the older employees. Some of the other common beliefs are that older people are sad and they're miserable and they're lonely and they want to live with their adult children. And that's not true. Most of them want to be independent. Most of them are not significantly lonely all the time. Though, we all experience episodes of loneliness particularly the many, many older persons who live alone. It's normal that they might feel alone at times but most of the time, they're staying busy, they stay involved and they stay happy. 

00:06:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY Certainly, one of the questions that we must ask our self is what biases or misinformation could influence our attitudes and behavior toward working with older persons? While getting older has its disadvantages, research has shown, for example, that the overall pattern for most older persons is of no decline in intelligence well into the 80s. In fact, most impairment seems to be related to poor health. In addition, while aging is accompanied by changes and decline in virtually every body system, most changes are so gradual that persons adapt to them without serious disruption of their daily activities. For example, 86 percent of older persons report one or more chronic physical impairments which do limit their performance of daily activities. Yet, more than 80 percent of older population live independently. Surveys and interviews with older persons show that independent living is exactly what they want. On the other hand, older persons do have both physical and mental health challenges which affect not only the individuals but their families, as well. 

00:07:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY But the three major causes of death among older persons are heart disease, stroke and cancer. Together, these three conditions account for 65 to 75 percent of all deaths. The cumulative effects of heart disease, stroke and cancer create increasing physical limitations during later years. The incidence of mental health disorders is known to increase with age so that at least 15 percent and, perhaps, as many as 65 percent of older persons may experience treatable disorders. Functional impairments, including psychosis and mood disorders, particularly depression, account for 30 to 40 percent of mental disorders in older persons. Organic disorders comprise up to 70 percent of reported cases. These include irreversible brain syndromes such Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia. Reversible or acute brain syndrome, also known as delirium, falls into this category, as well. It is estimated that between two and three million older persons are victims of Alzheimer's disease. And at this time, there is no known cause, no known treatment and no known cure. In addition to the patient's need for caring and formed assistance, the family and caregiver members have great need of support of counseling and assistance. 

00:09:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY The good news is most older persons do not have these more severe mental disorders. For those who do, there are increasingly more support systems. These include health professionals of various disciplines working together to meet their particular needs. Certainly, there is a need for more professional counselors to help in this very important work. More common and also in great need are the many persons dealing with life transitions which all of us must face as we age. In the following interview, Dr. Thelma Vriend, a retired professional counselor, administrator and later in the profession, talks about her experiences as one whose health problems challenged her to reevaluate her personal goals and activities. 

00:09:45
Thelma Vriend RETIRED COUNSELOR SUPERVISOR 

00:09:45
THELMA VRIEND From teaching and counseling, I decided to go into, uhm, community college administration. And it was a particularly strenuous job with loads of stress, political activity, et cetera, things that were really foreign to my nature and that I really got stretched out with and stressed with. So I had a couple of heart attacks and some other attendant, ah, health problems. And this kind of dragged out for a while. And I remember my sister saying to me, bring me lots of, oh, inspirational literature and saying, "You really are going to have to turn some things loose. And you really are going to have to come to grips with some things in your life. And you're really gonna have to deal with yourself." And I didn't hear her probably the first 10 times she said that to me. And as time went along and I was not really getting well, I started to think and to read about holistic, ah, health and holistic medicine and dealing with the whole person. So, I started out reading, uhm, you know, being very angry, wondering, "Why me?" and all the classic things that we do, uhm, got involved with, ah, a, a group called the Association for Research and Enlightenment. There are many comparable groups, uhm, went to a national convention, uhm, felt good about the focus on the whole person, started to really look at myself, uhm, to, ah, get some therapy, to really get to know who I was, why I was angry, who I was angry at and then to work at dissolving that anger and really, uhm, to work at what, what the rest of my life was about and what I wanted to do and wanted to be. Uhm, of course, when you're suddenly taken out of a work setting like that, you feel it's very important to go back to work. You know, you walk out of your office one day and then you never go back. 

00:12:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY Hmm. 

00:12:30
THELMA VRIEND And, of course, you wonder, you think of the mysteries of all of the things that are going on and you wonder, uhm, "Could I ever do that again?" And then you have to prove that you can. So I did after a year and a half, I did go back to work. But I promised myself that I would only do it if I could handle it and do other things rather than making this the focus of my life. And after a while, I wasn't doing that very well. And when life got to be getting up very early in the morning, going to work, barely getting back in the door, taking a nap so that you could get up and get ready to go to bed and then go to bed and get up and start the cycle over the next day, I knew that that was not living and it was time to, to seek some other, ah, ways of, of, of handling my life. So now, I can do many things, ah, rather than just go to work, come home, regroup, go to work because that the quality of life there is, is, uhm, really not worth living. I don't think. 

00:13:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY Dr. Vriend also tells us about another challenging transition in her life. This one relates to her aging mother and the psychological impact which this had upon her. 

00:13:55
THELMA VRIEND Ah, Mom was, ah, my mother was a very young. She was not a professional person. She was a homemaker. But she was a very active person in her church and in her community. And I remember her, you know, working with the children in the church and putting on all the plays for eastern Christmas and by, a vacation Bible school and this kind of thing. But being a very active person, a very involved person with life, ah, even, she lived alone, ah, for a long period of time but was still interested in, she had, she had boyfriends, ah, talked to me about this kind of thing and was very involved with life so that when she reached to 80, ah, shortly thereafter, she, ah, started to deteriorate and by it became senile. And my feelings about that, we had to, she lived in another town, we had to go and get her, bring her here. The time, it was during the year that I was ill so I couldn't keep her. My older sister was working. We did have to place her in a convalescent home for a little over a year until my sister retired. But I'll never forget taking her to that home. And I was always the pragmatic person who was hard hearted. And I didn't feel that this would bother me at all and not being able to sleep that night and feeling so very troubled about leaving her there and about not being able to, to care for her. And I remember sitting on a sofa beside her and watching the way she was and the way she acted and being very sad, crying, uhm, because in fact who, who I saw sitting on that sofa was not my mother. I saw myself. 

00:16:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
THELMA VRIEND And, and I became very afraid. Uhm, my sister did, ah, take my, my mother. And she lived with her for about three years. She died last year, about a year ago. But during that time, it was always, uhm, not just watching her change from the vital person she had been to someone who, ah, I remember one day we were in the bathroom when we passed a mirror. And I was helping her. She looked in the mirror and she said, "Who is that?" And I said, "Oh, Mama, that's me and you." She said, "No, no, no. Who's the old lady?" And I said, "Mama, that's you." And she said, "No, it's not." 

00:16:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY Hmm. 

00:16:55
THELMA VRIEND I think that says something about the way we feel about ourselves and how we see ourselves as we grow old even, even to somebody who's, ah, really kind of out of touch. 

00:17:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY The circumstances Dr. Vriend reports are not uncommon. In fact, studies have demonstrated that older persons repeatedly state that their bodies have aged but inside they maintain youthful vigor and attitudes. These persons who refuse to identify themselves as old with all the negative implications our society gives to that descriptor tend to remain healthier and happier longer. In the following illustrations, you'll have an opportunity to observe the application of techniques useful in helping older persons understand and potentially cope more successfully with their current life. A common behavior among older persons is reminiscing. Life review is one technique which is used creatively to help explore significant stages in human development as a reminiscing activity. Dr. Elly Waters, Director of the Oakland University Continuum Center, explains her use of this technique and why she thinks that it's important. 

00:18:05
Dr. Elino Waters CONTINUUM CENTER DIRECTOR 

00:18:05
DR. ELINO WATERS But why I think its important is for people to have a chance to put their life in perspective. And I think our feelings about life review are to me quite fascinating. When somebody famous does it, Winston Churchill wrote his memoirs... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. 

00:18:20
DR. ELINO WATERS ...and people thought it was marvelous. Here was his five volume set (laughing) you could put on your table. Ah, when somebody else may do it, ah, there goes Uncle Charlie, he's telling the same old stories again. But my guess is that when Uncle Charlie tells us stories, it's because he's trying to put some meaning into his life. 

00:18:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
DR. ELINO WATERS  And that's what a life review can do. Ah, it doesn't mean you have to think of all the, the famous things you did but to help people answer the question, you know, all things considered how do they do. Ah, when I take stock of my life, did I do the best I could with the deck I was dealt. 

00:18:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
DR. ELINO WATERS  And that's what as counselors I think we wanna help people put into perspective. I have a little overhead that I use sometimes and it has like a traffic sign and it says on it "if only" and there"s a big red line through it, like "No Parking" sign. 

00:19:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
DR. ELINO WATERS 'Coz I think if onlys are some of the hardest words for people to deal with. 

00:19:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
DR. ELINO WATERS  And I hear that so often from older people. Ah, you know, if only I'd been nicer. If only I gone to see my dad once more, if et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And one of the things that I tried to help people do in a life review is to cut, balance those if onlys. For the regret you have, let's make sure we've got at least as many things on the side of the ledger. 

00:19:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
DR. ELINO WATERS Things you're proud of. And if there's some unfinished business, that's a good time to finish it up, you know. Maybe, it's time now to make peace with the person you had a fight with 30 years ago when you can't even remember what the fight was about, anyhow. (sighs) And how can you do that? 

00:19:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Could you just describe briefly that, if, if you can describe briefly just the flow of a life review, how you conduct one? 

00:20:05
DR. ELINO WATERS Well, there are lots of different ways of conducting it and you can have people think about their lives. You can have people read music of an earlier, read books of an earlier period, hold that old newspapers, bring in pictures of various stages in their lives. One of the simple ways that we do it in some of our groups, is to just have people do a, a real quick fantasy, to close their eyes and to think back, picture themselves at various periods of their lives. And I usually do it as a young child, as an adolescent, as a young adult, as a middle-aged person now. And ask them to really picture who they were, where they were, who they were with, what they smell and what they were wearing, all those kinds of questions. 

00:20:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
DR. ELINO WATERS  To go through the various generations over decades of their lives and then to come back to now and then talk in the group about their recollections. And what happens and what's been so exciting for me is to do this with people and have people who've known each other for years sometimes, learn new things about each other. 

00:21:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
DR. ELINO WATERS It really is very bonding and people will make comparisons too. When you were a child that happened for you, for me, it was very similar or sometimes, you know, mine was exactly the opposite. And that, and often what they discover is even though their life experiences were different, their feelings about them were similar. So, it's part of the bonding process. 

00:21:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
DR. ELINO WATERS That I see as, as very important in a group. 

00:21:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY Are there any precautions, ah, any difficulties in using, ah, this kind of method or. 

00:21:45
DR. ELINO WATERS Sure, it can stir up some really sad memories for people. 

00:21:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Hmm. 

00:21:50
DR. ELINO WATERS Ah, I've never done a life review, for instance, with somebody who has consciously murdered another person. 

00:21:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
DR. ELINO WATERS I would think that would be hard. If I worked in a group, with a group of offenders, I'd be careful... (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
DR. ELINO WATERS ...about using it. 

00:22:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
DR. ELINO WATERS Ah, sometimes it's hard for people to see any of the bright spots in their lives and in that case, I think I'd wanna do some one to one work with the person. 

00:22:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Actually, it becomes a diagnostic tool... (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...in essence then, doesn't it? 

00:22:20
DR. ELINO WATERS Yeah. 

00:22:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
DR. ELINO WATERS But to help people appreciate their survivorship. 

00:22:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY Now you have an opportunity to see Dr. Waters illustrate the use of this technique with her group of peer counselors at her center in Detroit. She has taken them through a brief life stages review using imagery and we joined them as they begin the process of reporting their experiences. 

00:22:40
 Almost all my memories are, hold the family. 

00:22:40
DR. ELINO WATERS  Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
 That, ah, as I recall my very early childhood on the street which is near the Brewster Project then... (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
 ...in Detroit, ah, and the gate, and being at the gate so often and the, ah, activity that's taking place along the street. 

00:23:00
DR. ELINO WATERS Hmm. 

00:23:00
 As people are walking by, we, originally, we're next door to a, ah, blacks in a shop... (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
 ...and then it turned into a garage. And everyone knew every one on the block and all the activities centered around the family and neighbors... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
DR. ELINO WATERS Hmm. 

00:23:15
 ...and that was the important thing. And as I went though the various stages, it was always at home. 

00:23:20
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
 It was always home and family and as a teenager, uhm, although I, I skated and did other things, my memories are of reading and of music, how important. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
DR. ELINO WATERS  Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
 Those two things have been in my entire life. 

00:23:35
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
 And my early marriage, and how wonderful that was, earlier to my marriage. 

00:23:40
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
 And, ah, here I am now, uhm, a person who is extremely busy, extremely active, who is uncomfortable at home because then I have time to think about the things that distress me. 

00:23:55
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
 And, ah, I've almost got exactly the opposite. Family is still the most important thing in my life. 

00:24:05
DR. ELINO WATERS Yeah. 

00:24:05
 And, ah, yet I had extended out so much. I was shy. I would not be a. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
DR. ELINO WATERS Come on. 

00:24:10
 Servant. I, believe it or not, (laughing) I was so shy. I remember my father taking me to kindergarten coming home and saying, "She did not talk to one person." 

00:24:25
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
 He watched through the window. 

00:24:25
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
 And so, I have gone the, I, I enjoy being home. I, music is my greatest love. Reading is close second. I love people, I love being with people but I have, apparently, opened up into the world. 

00:24:40
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
 But still, most important though is family. They are the ones who I would rather be with, who bring me my greatest joy and my greatest sorrows. 

00:24:50
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. Uh hmm. What, it's almost a metamorphosis. 

00:24:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
DR. ELINO WATERS But the, the core values... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
 That's true. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
DR. ELINO WATERS  of family, of music, of reading are still, still there very much... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
 Correct. 

00:25:05
DR. ELINO WATERS ...at the core of it. That centered family life is not and cannot be what it once was. 

00:25:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
DR. ELINO WATERS You know, reaching out? 

00:25:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
DR. ELINO WATERS And taking some of that warmth with you isn't it? 

00:25:10
 Yeah. 

00:25:10
DR. ELINO WATERS Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
DR. TOME SWEENEY  Early recollections also are a rich source of information about our outlook on life, other people and ourselves. Unlike life review, this technique focuses on specific early life events that often can be recalled in vivid detail. Important to understanding their meaning to the individual are the feelings associated with the experiences, as well. An illustration of this is taken from a senior support group which I helped to lead. Two women co-counselors and myself asked our group of women if they would share specific experiences which they had had before the age of 68 years of age. We used them then to share insights about the individual's characteristic way of coping with life, others and herself. In the first case, we can see how major themes are carried throughout life and the work that this woman chose to do. 

00:26:05
 And one time, my mother was washing clothes and it was the time that they had the old fashioned washing machines where you fill the water in and, ah, let it out from the outside. And the water was soapy and hot and he let it out and he was only about two years old and it burned his stomach and, real bad. 

00:26:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
 My dad had to get on the horse. They ran to Amesville with, ah, to get the doctor and that. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
 And what did you do then? 

00:26:25
  Well, I was, I was a little older. I was three years older than him and I stayed home and, but, I never forgot. 

00:26:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY How did you feel when that happened? 

00:26:35
 Well, I felt pretty bad. 

00:26:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Did you? 

00:26:40
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY What, what did you do, do you remember anything about what you did or what your mother did or anything of that sort? 

00:26:40
  No, I just know that my mother was worried. 

00:26:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. And your father rode off in a horse... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
 Yeah. 

00:26:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY to take care of it and... (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...and really got, was he left home then? 

00:26:50
 No, and then they. 

00:26:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Your dad took him with him? 

00:26:55
 Uh hmm. And they took, ah, err, my dad used to have the, ah, one of the early, ah, Ford cars, you know? 

00:27:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
 What was the name of the first, first ones? 

00:27:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Model T. 

00:27:05
 But he didn't have it at that day. 

00:27:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
 And so, they rode a horse. 

00:27:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Oh. 

00:27:05
 That was about seven or eight mile from, almost Melville(ph) to Amesville to get Dr. Howard. 

00:27:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. What, ah, did, did you have any work outside of the home when you were. 

00:27:20
 Ah, when I first started to work was after I left high school. 

00:27:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Okay. What kind of work did you do during your life? 

00:27:25
 Well, I was, ah, I worked at Old Blemy's(ph) and, for 24 years after they opened before that was Chelming(ph) Arms. And after that, I, I, I retired but I don't want to retire but... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
 ...it didn't work out too well. I was restless and didn't know what to do, so, the next year, I applied to, ah, ah, Studio Point(ph) and they took me up there and I worked and they want me to come back but I didn't. So, I came back to Athens and the university called me and I was, was a housemother for five years. 

00:27:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY Okay. Now, did you spend a lot of your life looking after the people, didn't you? 

00:28:00
 Yeah. 

00:28:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. 

00:28:00
 At the hospital and. 

00:28:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. You've always cared about other people. 

00:28:00
 That's right. 

00:28:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY You liked to see people, you know, treat, treated well and... (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
 Yeah. 

00:28:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...if they're sick or they've been hurt or whatever to be or attended to and. 

00:28:10
 I used to do a lot of errands to hospital to please people. 

00:28:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY And, ah, do you like animals? Do you have pets or have this? 

00:28:15
 Uhm, no, I don't care about, too much about them. I'm in the house. I lock them outside... (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Right. 

00:28:20
 ...and if, if it's enough, uhm, ground or in that area but if you have a small house. I have a small, small yard with a small house, so I don't bother with them. 

00:28:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY Right. Right, okay, so, but when you were younger, did you... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...have pets outside and so forth? 

00:28:35
 Yeah, we always did. 

00:28:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. Ah, I'd like to make a point here, folks, if you can see what we're doing. Ah, what Nodar(ph) was telling is that her early recollections and they're really, really true. Nodar(ph) said she had three recollections but one of them was really, just I remember, we used to play on a rock and that's not quite the same as the other two. The one she said she remembered her friend coming to their house and sitting on her lamb and breaking its back... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...that she felt terrible. 

00:29:00
 That's right. 

00:29:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY And then she's tells us that she remembers her brother pulling the plug out of the hot wash water and getting scalded in his, her father. I guess picking him up and... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...rushing him to Amesville, riding a horse, probably, in a furious pace to get there to do something for the child. And she felt terrible again. And now she spent the biggest part of her life trying to help other people who are less fortunate because of sickness or injury or whatever or in a case of caretaking, just trying to see that other people are happy. And that's been a major theme in your life, has it? 

00:29:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. I see. 

00:29:40
 I never did sit around and do nothing. I always had to keep active. 

00:29:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY And you still don't. 

00:29:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY (laughing) 

00:29:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY You still don't. 

00:29:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY One of our members reported that she was having difficulty because her second husband had had a heart attack shortly after their marriage. This totally unexpected condition has brought much stress and concern into her life. That is how one of the counselors picked up on her recollection about a runaway pony and her feelings about her current situation. 

00:30:05
 One time we had a pony and to we rode the pony part of the time and it, ah, run off from me and I (laughing) I had a terrible time staying on it. And (laughing) I thought it was going to stop. It was really a scary thing. 

00:30:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. So he took off with you and you couldn't control him and he did run and... (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
 Right. 

00:30:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...you didn't fall off though. 

00:30:25
 No, I didn't fall off but I thought he's going to stop. I don't know how. I just kept pulling on the reins, you know, and telling him to stop. 

00:30:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. How did you feel? 

00:30:35
 Oh, I felt terrible. You know, you just have to, you just go and follow all the time. 

00:30:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Yeah. 

00:30:40
 Going that fast. 

00:30:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY And, and when he stopped, how was it then? You don't remember that? 

00:30:45
 I don't remember how, how. 

00:30:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY You're just remembered being scared... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
 Yeah. 

00:30:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...while it was running? 

00:30:45
  Right. 

00:30:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Okay. And. 

00:30:50
 And we, ah, had to walk to school at three, just a one-room schoolhouse, eight classes, and I went to that teacher. I'll let, I'll let you know, eight years, same teacher. (laughing) 

00:31:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Do you have any special recollections about that? 

00:31:05
 Well, we, the way we drank water, we drank water in a great big bucket. 

00:31:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
  We all drink out on the same dipper. We dipped the water up and drink on the same dipper. We'd put it back in that water. Any body who'd want to drink would come along drink it again. And then drink out of that same bucket. 

00:31:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. 

00:31:25
 (laughing) We had an old potbelly stove in the middle of the schoolroom and that's, ah, how we heated the schoolhouse. 

00:31:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Were those good days for you? 

00:31:35
 Oh yes, very much. 

00:31:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
 But, you won't see kids doing that nowadays. 

00:31:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY No, no. 

00:31:40
 No. 

00:31:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY No. 

00:31:40
 They can't even walk up to the store nowadays. They got to get in a car or on a bicycle. 

00:31:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY (laughing) It's true. You know, there are some real advantages in the lives that we've had as youngsters and we had to do things. 

00:31:50
 Right. 

00:31:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY And now as we're older, it's easier to do. We don't feel like, ah. 

00:31:55
 There was eight of us, there was eight of us and I'm the youngest one. 

00:32:00
 You won't believe me when I tell you I went to a one-room school for six grades. 

00:32:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Why would I believe you? 

00:32:05
 'Coz she's younger. (laughing) 

00:32:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Oh, I can't believe that. I was thinking back on the, on the pony running away with you and being scared. 

00:32:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Can you think of any situations like that or, or situations that you, well, let, let me put it this way. I guess I have a hunch that you don't like to be, where something else is in control and you can't do anything about it. How do you feel about flying on airplanes? 

00:32:30
 Oh, I like to fly. 

00:32:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY Do you? Okay. 

00:32:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY And, uhm. 

00:32:35
 Well, I think it might be something else... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
 ...it might be that she expected it to be one way and it turned out much different. 

00:32:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
 And it wasn't what she expected. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
 Right. 

00:32:45
 That just threw her. 

00:32:45
 Right. 

00:32:45
 And this is kinda how things are now. 'Coz when you got married, you expected the second time. You expected things to be a certain way. 

00:32:55
 Yeah. 

00:32:55
 And they're not. And it's real on 73. 

00:32:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Oh, yes. I see that. (laughing) That's very good. Yes. Do you see. 

00:33:05
 I didn't hear quite all you said. 

00:33:05
 Okay. Let me say it again. Is that, well, you expected the, the pony to act a certain way and it didn't. And it just threw you because it is not what you expected to be like and it was really terrifying. 

00:33:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
 So, when you got married this last time, you expected life to go a certain way... (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
 ...and all these things happened that you didn't expect at all. 

00:33:20
 Right. 

00:33:20
  And didn't like it at all. It's really unsettling for you. 

00:33:25
 Right. 

00:33:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY  It's like being on that pony. (laughing) Now, the good news is, you didn't fall off. 

00:33:35
 Right. 

00:33:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Right? You made it. 

00:33:35
 That same thing is gonna happen again. I think I'm not gonna give up. (laughing) 

00:33:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY You're gonna hang on. By golly, that was scary. 

00:33:40
 (laughing) Just hang on. Keep on hanging on. 

00:33:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY  That's the good news. 

00:33:45
 Right. 

00:33:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY You do survive. You become. 

00:33:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY There are many other illustrations of how early development influences our later approaches to life situations. In this program, however, we've used interviews with a variety of persons to demonstrate that human development does not stop with adolescence nor does getting older mean that you will feel or want to act old when you're older. And neither do the vast majority of people with whom you work, who are already called older. Human development, as we know it, never stops, only the attitudes conveyed by saying such as, "old dogs can't learn new tricks," will distract from the fact that learning is continuous throughout life. If you will act upon this fact, your work with older persons will be far more interesting and effective.
