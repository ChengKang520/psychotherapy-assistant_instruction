ACA Association for Specialists in Group Work Encouraging Risk Taking in Group Dr. Jeffrey A. Kottler University of Las Vegas 

00:00:00
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER  The idea for this particular program uhm, is based on a concept that's very dear to my heart and it's one in which ah, I believe very strongly that we should be able to do what we ask our group members to do. And if we aren't both skilled and courageous enough to take some risks ourselves in our own lives with the people that matter most to us, then how the heck are we gonna ever ask our group members to do the same thing? Much of ah, what we're gonna talk about is inspired from ah, my latest book, ah, Advance Group Leadership, in which there's a chapter in there ah, and it seemed at the time somewhat rare that there was much discussion or at least the whole chapter in the book on risk taking, uhm, which I uhm, see is being the "in one sense," one of the, the essences of whatever it takes place in groups that are therapeutic and re, regardless of what kind of group that is. And risk taking has been a thing for me uhm, that I've struggled with for, for quite some time. The metaphor, the analogy, the image that stands out for me the most and I'd like to ask you to indulge me even though we're gonna feel kinda stupid doing this is I'd like you, everybody, to put your hand on your heart for a minute. I can feel my heart beating pretty quickly. I don't know about you, but I'd like you to feel your heart beating in your chest.

DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER  The heart is, as we all know, a muscle and it's a muscle that's contracting and expanding and contracting and expanding every second, 60 times a minute, 60 minutes an hour, 24 hours a day, even 25, 30, 50, a hundred times since we started, I started talking to you. And this human muscle is wearing out. And during one ah, bleak moment in my life or few minutes in my life, I sat down with a calculator and figured out how many times the human heart beats in the average life span before it stops, before it wear us out. And I figured out if we live to be around 80-85, the human heart beats about three billion times, which sounds like a lot of heartbeats. Until we start considering that from most of us in this room, we've already used up a million and a half, maybe even two billion of those heartbeats there's only a, a billion left. And I feel my heart beating and I think about the number of heartbeats that I have left and that's if I'm lucky to live to be 80. And in my case, that's probably wishing and dreaming, considering my mother was dead by the time she was my age of a heart problem and my father, when he was my age, had a coronary bypass for the first time. So I'm not sure I will be blessed with another billion and a half or maybe even not another billion heartbeats. A while ago, I discovered uhm, how many of these heartbeats that I have squandered in my life by not taking some risks, and I think back on my years as an adolescent and especially when I was 14 and 15 years old, and with my best friend. I spent every Saturday afternoon, every Saturday afternoon taking the bus to the local mall with my best friend to meet girls, and this was so important that I passed up opportunities for family trips, I passed up any number of opportunities that I had because every Saturday afternoon, I had to go to the mall to meet the one girl that was waiting for me in my life. Now, I think I figured out, I, I mean the numbers, I figured out at one point that I had a string of 70 something consecutive Saturdays without missing one, then I must have missed one and then went another 20 but something like a hundred Saturdays of my adolescence I spent at Northland Mall in suburban Detroit(ph), to meet girls. And what's so remarkable about this experience is that in a hundred consecutive Saturdays my best friend and I not only never met a girl, we never approached one. And we sat there and we had our routine done uhm, so well that when two girls would walk by, we would argue between one another as to which got the tall one and which got the short one or which got that one or that one, and we would argue just long enough. So by the time we agreed, the girls were gone and we didn't have to approach them. Now, it just amazes me how much time in my life I've wasted wanting to approach people, wanting to know people, wanting to do things that I've just not done. And I can't get those hundred Saturday afternoons back and "Oh, this has have burn me that I can't do anything about that." And I remember when ah, I was a little bit older, it had been my ah, life's ambition, in my adolescence, to someday be old enough to be able to go out with a waitress because waitresses were goddesses to me. They were always seem so tall because we were sitting down and they brought food and uhm, ah, they were just, I don't know. A, I've, a waitress to me was about the most dramatic(ph), ah, the most wonderful person on earth and I, and they always seem so unapproachable to me and always seemed ah, older. And I was out, it wa, I'll never forget this, it was a Sunday night and ah, I was out with my family for dinner, I think I was home from college, I was about 19-20 years old. I remember the restaurant we're at vividly, and it occurred to me as I looked around this restaurant that I was about the same age as these waitresses, that they were finally at an age in which I could ask them out and the same kinds of disasterizing and things that I had said to myself when I was 14 and 15 also took place, but no waitresses or goddesses and they never go out with you and don't even try Jeffrey, don't, don't kid yourself. And I do not know what clicked. I think it was the incredible anger or maybe the realization I had that nobody could do to me what I did to myself after I missed these opportunities. And ah, in an opportune moment I approached the waitress of our very table and asked her if she would like to go out to me, with me to which she promptly refused. And not to be daunted, I then approached another waitress in the same restaurant because I figured out I was on a row and I asked her out and she said no as well. And I approached the third re, ah, waitress in the same restaurant and she also said no. And that was three ah, waitresses in the same 10-minute time that all said no to going out with me and I felt so exhilarated. I couldn't believe it. It felt like a turning point in my life that nobody could ever reject me again. That was the last time that that could happen. People could say no to me but co, nobody was ever gonna reject me again and nobody could ever hurt me as much as I was hurting myself. Now, that attitude and philosophy has served me so well since I was 19 years old, during the years when jobs were really tight. And I applied to probably something over 200 counselor education positions and I probably have applied to every single one of your universities, every single one of your states. I've been everywhere to interview and got letter after letter after letter saying, "No, thank you." And ah, when I was ah, also early in my writing career, ah, my first book that I ah, tried to get ah, published in the mid-1970's when I was still a doctoral student was rejected by something over 80 publishers. I had 80 rejection letters, and by now, I had learned that ah, this just fuels my commitment and my motivation that people can say, "No." Eighty publishers in a row can say that they don't wanna publish my books, a hundred universities can say that they don't wanna hire me but by gosh I'm gonna keep going. I'm gonna keep putting myself out there and keep taking risks, and any of you that know anything about the stuff that I write know that taking risks is a really core part of who I am and what I try to write about. I'm hopeful that these opening remarks might inspire some of you here to take some risks in your lives starting with today, starting with this afternoon, as well as probably far more important some risks that you might take ah, outside of your new lives when you go home. Ah, there are a number of inhibitors... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
 Hmm. 

00:10:05
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER ...ah, to risk taking, a number of things that get in the way and I'll be talking about that. I'll also be talking to set the stage some of the assumptions about group work that I think we can all agree with to look at risk taking in a certain context because risking in and of itself isn't necessarily such a wonderful thing. There are times when risking is highly inappropriate. There are many group members that we have worked with and whom we see who, ah, getting them to take more risks is hardly the objective and hardly the goal. Risking can be extremely reckless, ah, and we know quite a number of group members that we've worked with who are very reckless in the risk taking and behaviors that they engage in. Uhm, in the group itself, ah, they may be inappropriate risks with respect to confronting other group members inappropriately and they think that that's normative, wonderful thing to do. And they're off the wall, and they're they do harm and they hurt people ah, because they're out there and they're saying whatever they think and whatever they feel and whatever goes through their heads and hearts without censoring that, without looking at the impact of that in other people. There's also recklessness in the sense that our group members go out into the world and sometimes they make impulsive decisions that are hardly good for them, that are hardly sensible, irrational they'll ah, impulsively quit a job without having something else in mind. They'll impulsively walk out of a relationship without having the opportunity to work it through. They all impulsively go out in the world and tell people things that would be in their best interest not to do. Risking can also be very self defeating in ah, several ways within the group. It can be very self defeating to disclose yourself too much. Ah, certainly, anyone must be wondering what is in it for me to take a risk and reveal myself with these cameras running and people watching this, so I've never met them, we'll never know. Uhm, there's also ah, risking can be self defeating outside the group when people do things without a plan. Without thinking through the consequences of the things that they are about to do. And thirdly, risking can be irrelevant. It's not the answer for everything. Ah, for the group members that are working on restraint and self control and self discipline, risking is the last thing in the world that's relevant to their lives, to their individual counseling plan. Uhm, similarly for, oh, in a, there's a, a wonderful book called "Risking" in which the author whose name escapes me in this moment, talks about type A risk and type B risks. And type A risking is the uhm, dramatic kind, ah, the kind that gets a lot of immediate attention, the kind of risking in which people do things that are physically dangerous. They win ah, congressional medals of honor and they uhm, the guy interviewed ah, the French tight rope walker that strung the wire between the World Trade towers and uhm, didn't perceive that behavior to be risky at all but what he thought was incredibly risky was being involved in a relationship with a woman. Now that was a risk to him. And the author talks about how type B risks don't get a lot of the dramatic attention, but the people that choose to be type A risk takers, they go for the gusto, they put their lives on the line, they are into rock climbing and lots of dangerous sports, are exactly the same people that would never risk intimacy in a relationship. So sometimes risking of a type A nature is hardly relevant for somebody that's struggling with closeness with other people which is ah, not(ph) quite a different kind of risking. Also it's important to realize as we set the stage for what we're gonna do this afternoon. Is risking a course in a particular context that it's not the only thing. It may not even be the most important thing that takes place in groups. It's simply one of a number of ingredients, a number of variables that when they're put altogether seem the, to make a difference in some way. The first handout I'd like to distribute to you summarizes what many people who've been writing for a long time in the group field, consider to be some of the ah, the major factors that operate in groups in constructive and helpful ways. I have been confused and have been writing for some time ah, in a, a number of different places about ah, my utter bewilderment about how as group leaders we can function in so many different ways and be so effective and so successful that some of us identify ourselves as being primarily action oriented. We have task-oriented-structured groups with specific goals in mind in which we get the group members to rehearse in world planning, go out into the world to declare specific homework assignments they're gonna work on and we find that those kind of groups work fabulously. They are incredibly effective. And then there are those among us who ah, perform more cognitive model and we like to use more of the training approach in terms of teaching people to think differently and talk differently and use different language and we help them to do that in the group and we help them to go out in the world to do that as well and lo, and behold that works too. And then there are those of us who are more humanistically relationship oriented, more process oriented. Who, what we like to do is(ph) create a bond, to create cohesion. Create love and caring and compassion among people that somehow that healing energy will, will make a difference and we don't need to spend time about the specifics. They'll take care of themselves that what we need to do is create the safe environment and sure enough, that works too. And so on and so forth with the dozen or two dozen or ten dozen or a million different approaches there are to running groups. From what we've read in the literature, ah, if certain conditions are met, there's some evidence to indicate that many, many, many of them are equally effective and that the, the superiority of one over the other is dreaming. So what I've tried to do in this first handout is summarize what, across the board, if we could, every single one of us agree on what do we think of the elements, the variables, the ingredients that make the difference in any group regardless of what it's called, regardless of the group leader, perhaps you'll find many of these ingredients, many of these factors plotted on these ah, two-dimensional graph looking at where it fits within the perspective of a cognitive ver, versus affective orientation and an insight versus an action oriented approach. So, we have certain inside oriented things like helping people understand their unconscious motives, cognitive dissonance, understanding payoffs and then we have some of the more action-oriented things like helping people ah, accomplish certain tasks both in the group and outside the group. Within all of these different ingredients, from support in giving feedback, to setting goals, and challenging irrational assumptions, risk taking is one of those factors and in and of itself is probably virtually useless and maybe harmless. And maybe, I should say, very harmful in many cases where we encourage people to take risks without looking out what is the intent of this. What do you want to accomplish? What do you hope to gain by doing this? How is this gonna help you? How are you ready and prepared to do this? And mostly looking at the consequences that as we'll talk about in a few minutes, there's a lot of reluctance to taking risks, even to commit ourselves in a public forum risks we'd like to take because that sets in motion. Sometimes in irrevocable series of events that we may not want to look at and deal with what the consequences of those initial actions might be. So I wanted to set the stage by reviewing what many of us would agree with the important and as you look at these ingredients some of them, you feel especially drawn to. Some of them are especially important to you in the ways that you run your groups. Likewise, you look at some of these and sort of shrug to yourself and say, "I don't do that anymore. That's not it, all that important to me." Ah, but maybe to a certain extent all of us can relate to seeing some of these variables in the groups that we run. Secondly, risk taking take a, a course not only within a context of variables but also within a context of stages. And in my professional lifelong confusion about trying to figure out how is it possible that we can operate so differently and yet produce such similar results or such comparable results. I tried to compile perhaps a generic approach to group leadership that most of us could agree with. This is ah, maybe an approach to doing groups that would encompass almost every approach that's out there, that would a, ah, include all of the stages that every, almost everybody says are important, so on the second handout, you'll notice that the first stage, are really pre-treatment issues because we're well aware of the fact that counseling and group work takes ah, begins long before the people end up in our groups. In fact, we've discovered that sometimes that initial phone call or that initial decision to seek help or that initial decision to get in the group might be the single most dramatic(ph) thing that a group member does. In any case, there is a development of some sentence or some set of concerns or some issues or something that the client becomes aware of such that he or she decided to do something about it and seek our services or join one of our groups. Stage two which is often labeled stage one, the exploration stage, does includes quite a number of different ingredients. Uhm, Sam at lunch, you talked a lot about hope and hope is a really significant part about ah, the exploration stage. Uhm, when we ah, set the parameters for our groups, whatever the, whatever it is, ah, how we choose to talk, it's kind of interesting when we watch group ah, beginning group leaders start groups, whether uncertainty and the lack of confidence comes through and kind of a difference between starting a group from the posture of welcome-to-this-group vibe(ph). You know, I really haven't done this very much and I don't know if this could be helping you or not, but what the heck, let's give it a try ah, versus, ah, setting the hope or setting the placebo where you've really come to the ah, right place. You're gonna get something out of this. It's gonna be extremely powerful. Ah, you may not like this all the time but you're gonna be profoundly differently when this is over. In fact, you're already noticing ways that you're different now than you were 30 minutes ago, and think about some of those ways and that self-fulfilling expectations, uhm, Jefferson Fisher's wonderful book on Placebo Therapy that was written in the early '70s about how one of the universal dimensions of all approaches that, to healing and helping is how critical with that, it is for us to believe in what we're doing. And if we don't believe that what we're about to do is gonna make a difference, how are we gonna ever sell that to our group members and our clients. So, in all the various forms I've just been fascinated with watching videos and watching films, seeing Carl Rogers(ph) do groups and seeing Fritz Perls(ph) do groups and seeing Virginia Satir(ph) do groups, and seeing all the luminaries that we've grown up with. Up until the present time doing groups and asking ourselves, come on what's going on here? What are they all doing that's the same instead of what not, whether they are all doing that's different because we all seem to be vested in selling our particular perspectives as being the answer for everybody else and all you have to do is be like me and you'll be fine. In the exploration stage, I think that most, if not all group leaders who are effective are successful in conveying their hope and instilling that sense of hope, not to mention some of the other things we're well aware of, the, the role that trust building has and every group leader from ah, the most ah, ah, true to Rogers' client-centered group leader to the, ah, to a behavioral group leader that's running a weight loss group knows and unless we can build, unless we're able to build some level of trust and cohesion, people aren't gonna feel safe enough here to talk about some of their fears. Within this context of exploration, there is one kind of risk taking that takes place, that perhaps is different from risk taking in other stages. This is the risk taking in which we reveal ourselves. The risks we take of being authentic. The risks we take of putting ourselves out there, being honest with one another knowing that we may be judged and judged harshly and critically when we let those masks come down. So, when we reveal ourselves, when we're willing to open ourselves up and let the members of the group inside, we're taking profound risks or I should say our group members are taking profound risks. In the third stage, the insight stage. I just threw everything in the kitchen sink in there, I mean, every kind of insight that you can think of, uhm, is legitimately in the insight stage, and I am not sure of any evidence that indicates that one is any better than the other; and some self-psychology sorts of group or psycho-dynamic groups really think that looking at our unconscious behavior is critical and I agree that can be important than others, ah, will have us believe that no, let's think(ph) in the present moment and give each other feedback and confront each other with our inconsistencies, and that's another kind of insight, in "Aha(ph)" experience. And I was, uhm, you know, trying to think about some of the, the magic moments of what it means to be a group leader and I mean, ah, I don't know what comes to mind for you, but I got it for me. I, I, I've been thinking about this question for a while. This happened fairly recently that it was fairly obvious that a group member was doing something, was engaging in a behavior uhm, that she had been doing her whole life, and it was obvious to me and obvious to everyone in the group and probably obvious to everyone in her life and nobody had ever told her. She's 30 years old and she doesn't know that people hate that grin she has on her face when she's nervous and nobody's ever told her that. And that kind of experience that takes place sometimes in a minute and a half when a group member says, "You know that grin just bugs the hell out of me." And if you're gonna be sincere with me, how can I take you seriously when you're grinning like a loon like that or something hopefully more compassionate, more caring (laughs) and more sensitive, and actually seeing that light bulb go off on her head where she's thinking, "My gosh I've been doing this my whole life and nobody has ever told me." And then, for her to go out in the world and, and change that behavior so she comes back and she's never the same while we see irrefutable evidence of that if not every group session we leave, then every second or every third one. And for me, that's the addiction to this stuff, that's what's so compelling about groups is that it's much easier to see there's going on in a group than there is in individual counseling because there's so much going on at the same time. Well, whatever your favorite kind of insight is that you like to promote uhm, ah, whether you know you're prone to cognitive ah, confronting your rational beliefs or whatever it is looking at our ah, ah, behaviors that are self-destructive and self-defeating, there is nevertheless, for most of us, some insight that takes place in our groups, some level of self-awareness and self-understanding. For many of us, this may, in fact, be the guts of our groups. Frankly, it is for me. Uhm, this is the part that I've always enjoyed the most, stages 2 and 3. Uhm, there's also a certain amount of peer support and reassurance that takes place as a transi, transition to stage 4 which is an action orientation. And ah, we do this in many, many different ways and risk taking is an intricate part of any action that takes place. That critical point we get in a group where a group member, uhm, discloses aloud "yes I have a problem with this. Yes, I need to do something about it," and then he is actually gonna do about it. And not only what are you gonna do about it but when are you gonna do that, and when you come back next week, what are you gonna tell us about what you did. And that kind of public commitment that takes place not only what just douses(ph) their individual counselor, but all of their peers is, as we all know is powerful, powerful medicine. So, within the context of quite a number of other action-oriented ah, strategies, uhm, goal setting and reality testing and rehearsal, and so on and so forth, risk taking is also a part of stage 4 as well. And then stage 5 is ah, probably the stage that we do least effectively in groups and that's the evaluation because we're so overwhelmed with everything that's going on in any given moment, uhm, and so overwhelmed with all the different things that we have to attend to, and so overwhelmed with all the things that we're trying to remember and process from last week that we don't do as good a job as perhaps we ought to do in keeping our finger on the pulse of our group members as to how are you doing and what's going on and how you, ah, what are you doing with what happened last week. Uhm, my group leader is here, Shirley(ph), and ah, we do a group together for other ah, counselors and therapists. And I'm aware that in working together, Shirley, one of the things, and we're talking about this in our last group. One of the things that we don't do that well is each group session we start over again. Uhm, there's only an hour and a half and so we start our groups by saying, "Okay, you know, who wants some time," and we launch into something new. And forgetting to take the time to say, "Well, what's going on with the rest of you from last time?" forgetting that, that continuity. Uhm, nevertheless, uhm, I think that probably everyone in here might choose to amend these stages in certain ways maybe you'd call 'em something different, maybe you'd personalize this in a way that's different from this, based on the setting in which you work, based on your own philosophy and your own thinking, based on your theoretical orientation, ah, based on who you are is a person much less as a leader but I'm trying to start out with some common language so that we're not just spending the afternoon talking about risk taking as if it's just something that's out there and we just throw it in as a technique but that risk taking fits within a, a particular context. A context of therapeutic variables that we think are important and a context of stages. The last thing that I'd like to talk to you about, to set the stage for what we're gonna do is a review of what some of the inhibitors to risk taking are. That is, I think we all agree this is wonderful stuff. This is really important, so why don't we do this? And why our group members so reluctant to take risks in their lives. And this last handout summarizes,- 

00:31:45
RISK TAKING INHIBITORS 

00:31:45
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER - many of the reasons why group members and why we as, as human beings are reluctant to take risks. First of all, there's the, the fear of consequences. That is, that we ah, engage in a whole lot of cognitive rehearsal as well as affective experiences where we disasterize, where our group members think to themselves,- 

00:32:10
Disasterizing/exaggerating outcomes 

00:32:10
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER - "Well, if I share with the other people here who I am and what's really important to me or something I've been thinking about that I've never told another person before or some secret I have that I'd been holding close to my best that I haven't shared." You know, when we asked our group members what their fantasy is, or what would happen if they would do that. What they imagine is that people would puke their guts out or there are people would flee out of the room and scream in terror or throw things at them because they're so awful and so terrible for being as human as they are. Related to that is a fear of failure uhm, which is something that I've uhm, written a lot about, ah, related to my own fears of failure, ah, related to uhm, why I work so hard, doing what I'm doing, trying to prove myself again and again and again, and what is it that I'm running from, and what is it that I'm running to. And uhm, the and, the ah, story that I started this out with, "Why ah, was my friend and I not willing to approach these girls at the mall?" It was the fear that we would be humiliated, we would be laughed at. And of course, if only we were, that would have been nothing compared to what we did to ourselves. And finally, we ah, related to this first kind of fear of consequence is the approval of others, certainly inhibits us from taking risks and group members in taking risk because so many of us feel like we're on probation. And that people are willing to love us and be part of our lives only as long as we're willing to meet their expectations and that once we should take a risk and venture on our own, they're not gonna be our friends anymore. They're not gonna like us or care for us anymore and many of us got those messages in our families and have carried them forth in other groups in our lives. Secondly, another inhibitor of risk taking is when the perceived gains are less than the potential losses. And I think this is pretty common sense. There are times in which when we're thinking at a very calculated rational way, we're asking ourselves, "What can I possibly gain from revealing myself?" First is what I could lose, and are these risks acceptable and if I am gonna take a risk, how can I calculate what damage I might experience- 

00:34:40
Acceptable Risks Calculated Risks 

00:34:40
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER - and this is sane and sensible behavior in groups that we want to encourage. But we do encourage especially during those early stages when we can do as much damage to our groups by people taking risks too early. And I think, most of us have experienced what that's like when in the very first session, somebody just puts themselves out there and ah, you can't shut them up and they frighten the other people by the intensity of what they bring and we'll lose group members and they don't come back because they're ah, fearful. So we do wanna encourage, uhm,- 

00:35:15
Perfectionistic Expectations 

00:35:15
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER  -"Hey guy, I have a seat right here for you." (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
 Excuse(ph) me(ph) (laughs). 

00:35:20
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER  Is this payback time by the way? 

00:35:25
 Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Yes. 

00:35:25
 Absolutely. 

00:35:25
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER  Fourthly, uhm, stress is another ah, factor that- 

00:35:35
All or nothing law I must do it right 

00:35:35
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER - inhibits risk taking and this is something we do have a lot of control over and we spend a lot of time working on this in our groups. That we're trying to reduce the perceived stress. We're trying to reduce the kind of, the sense of panic. The kind of uhm, ah, rehearsing that goes on inside group members' heads, ah, inhibiting themselves, "I'd really like to say this and I'd really ah, like to do this," but if I do and their hearts start beating so quickly in their chest that they can't even open their mouths much less let any words fly out. And then finally, probably most useful of all in terms of looking at why group members won't take risks has to do with their secondary gains of staying the same, uhm, the advantages of inertia. Uhm, the commitment that people have, I don't know about your groups but I am still waiting ah, for the group member who will come in and will articulate, you know, so clearly, "I, I know this is gonna be hard and I know- 

00:36:35
Avoidance of discomfort and unknown Self-pity External blame 

00:36:35
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER - this is gonna take a lot of discomfort and I know you can't do it for me and I know I have to do it myself then, (laughs) but I'm willing to do it and I'm gonna to do it and I'm ready to start." I mean even when they say that (laughs), I'm so cynical at this point that I'm (laughs) thinking, "Come on!" Uhm, ah, the kind of self-pity that group members enjoy from staying the same, the kind of attention they get, the, the kind of mileage they get out of being helpless and staying stuck and related to that is getting to blame other people. "It's not my fault that, ah, I'm so messed up and I know you guys would like to help me and I very much would like you to help me as well but as you know ah, it's just that you know, I've, here I am in St. Petersburg where it's always supposed to be sunny and it's cloudy out there and that's why I'm feeling blue and I can't help it or blaming family members or bosses or friends or other people and, of course, the brighter the people are the better excuses they come up with for why they can't take risks and why they can't venture out of their safety zone. So, with those introductory remarks we now move into your risking. And the first thing that I would like to ask us to do, is uhm, some risk taking that we might do right now with the people in this group to the extent to which you feel. I don't wanna say comfortable but comfortable and perhaps courageous. That is, if you think of some public commitment that you haven't said out loud before in a context like this of something that you need to do in your life, something that you really wanna do in your life. That you have experienced some resistance to, some procrastination, some considerable reluctance, some considerable excuse making as to why it's not possible, why you can't do it. I'd like you, first of all, to imagine sharing something about yourself whatever it is, whether it's a public commitment you like to make or something that you would like to share right now that you haven't shared before in this context and I'd like you to imagine that before you share it aloud, if you could sort of rate on a 1 to 10 scale as to how risky is it for you to reveal that with us right now. And the way to know how risky that is, of course, is by putting your hand on your heart again and if your heart is beating out of your chest with the prospect of saying that out loud then you know it's an 8 or 9 or a 10. And if it's just going up a little blip, then you know it's a 1 or 2 or a 3 or, or something in between. I've been a firm believer that uhm, before we ask group members to do something we should ah, be able to model them as group leaders, so I'll go first and then we'll make a decision as to whether you want the cameras to keep rolling or whether you'd like to turn them off. Uhm, two examples of some risking one is for me, one is uhm, I've been doing this for a long time doing lots of these presentations and I do lots of these presentations. So I would think that even though I appear to be very calm right now, and I, I guess I do feel calm right now, once I start I feel okay but my anxiety about doing programs like this much be so high that I don't sleep the night before. I didn't sleep last night, Now, I haven't done this particular program ever before, this presentation ever before and I was feeling somewhat relaxed but all night long I think I did fall asleep for a couple of hours between, about 2:30 to 5:30. Now, I'm mildly embarrassed about this that I've been doing this for so long and I do this so frequent, when is that gonna stop. When am I gonna stop feeling like I'm still on probation that I'm gonna come in here, I'm gonna talk and people are gonna get up and leave or people are gonna hate me. Or I'm just gonna blow it or it's not gonna work or it's not gonna gel(ph) or when I ask people to take group, ah, risks nobody is gonna say a word. And I tried to talk to myself in the same way that I would talk to my group members. And I just feel like such a hypocrite that it doesn't work and I loose a night sleep every damn time I do this. Now, now, if I would rate that on a 1 to 10 scale, I'd say that was about a 2. Uhm, that was a little risky but my heart isn't beating that fast. That's a, a variation of some things that I've revealed before my writing. Something I could share, uhm, that's about a 6 or a 7, something I will share with you right now. Uhm, it has to do with something that was sparked uhm, by a conversation I had earlier today, where when I'm gonna confront my own workaholism. Ah, when am I gonna confront uhm, I have some colleagues here that are nodding their heads, (laughs) uhm, that uhm, what am I running from, that I'm so driven? Ah, that ah, three books a year isn't enough, so five books this year, and six books the next year. What am I trying to prove? I mean, that's not a real healthy behavior I don't think, uhm, I play hard and I, I take a lot of time, ah, especially with my son, to a lesser extent with my wife, uhm, I think I'm relaxed and I, you know, I take care of myself, but what is it that I am trying to prove? Now, by saying this out loud, I hate this 'coz it's on tape. (laughs) And everything, and I can't take it back, but I'm saying this out loud because I have to do something about this. Uhm, If it's not, if this part of me is not out of control yet, I'm going to spin out of control. Uhm, and by saying this out loud, uhm, what's really risky about this for me is I'm recognizing I'm not ready to do anything about this yet and I, I think this is the first stage to say this. And I'm giving myself a way out to 'coz when I see you at the next conference and you're gonna say, "Hey Jeff, I remember you said you were gonna, how many books did you write this year?" Uhm, I will be embarrassed to say that I probably didn't cut back my output, ah, output yet. But, I'm recognizing maybe ah, for the clearest, so far that, that something I have to do something about it, even if it means me getting back in a group, or getting back into therapy to do something about it. I'd like to now, uhm, know from you whether there is ah, a significant grounds well of, of ah, opinion as to whether you'd like the cameras turned off for any sharing that you would like to do. I'm seeing some heads going down. But if there is a significant opin, ah, opinion about that then I'll ask them to turn the cameras off. Does anyone have a very strong opinion about wanting to turn the cameras off? Before you reveal yourselves. 

00:44:15
 (inaudible ) really, really (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Yeah. I like that. How about any time, ah, if you get into something and you have decided that you didn't realize, I wish I had realized I had that option. Can we go back and rewind this? (laughs) Uhm, anytime you wanna turn the camera off, uhm, point to the camera and uhm, she'll shut the camera off. 

00:44:50
 Ah, I'm (inaudible ) so you don't have to (inaudible ) pointing. 

00:44:55
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Okay. (laughs) So, shall we say, you're the one that controls the camera? 

00:45:00
 Well, I mean I can set it up (inaudible ). 

00:45:02
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Okay, so pointing isn't enough. Say, "Turn the camera off." Okay, who'd like to go next? (laughs) So you're gonna help me with this film(ph) by not saying anything, huh? (laughing) 

00:45:15
MARTHA  So, I was just sitting here, thinking that having these cameras on would probably limit the depth of what I wanna(ph) reveal. But having them on is not a problem. 

00:45:30
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Are you willing to share right now? And you, you're saying you'd like the camera turned off? 

00:45:35
MARTHA No. 

00:45:35
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Okay. 

00:45:35
MARTHA I was just thinking about it. (laughing) 

00:45:35
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Well, Martha when you're ready, you let us know, and we'll turn those cameras off, 'coz we sure wouldn't wanna inhibit you. 

00:45:40
MARTHA No, that's not what I was saying. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
MARTHA What I was saying is, it's okay with me but it, but it certainly, I, you know, be puzzled. I believe in this, you know I'm talking about that, because I believe this group with(ph) that, I believe we must have the right to limit this to something (inaudible ) and that's what I tell my group members and that's what I'm gonna(ph) do with the cameras on. 

00:45:56
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER Okay. 

00:45:56
MARTHA  And that's why we're doing anything well(ph). 

00:46:00
DR. JEFFREY A. KOTTLER As you no doubt, notice, there was considerable discussion among the participants about uhm, the effects of being videotaped, ah, inhibiting their own risk taking in this particular group. After the camera was turned off, ah, indeed things did seem to take off. Ah, there was time for about 20 of the participants to take some risks that they rated anywhere from a 2 to 9 and 3 quarters, and there were even a few 10's. Uhm, the group members shared uhm, some risks that ah, ranged from ah, commitment or decision to get a doctoral degree knowing ah, what that would mean. Uhm, another participant ah, talked about the importance of being able to be more open about being lesbian. There were other ah, participants that shared a variety of things related to their work and things they intended to do differently as well as some relationships in their lives. After ah, we finish that I go-around, ah, I talked about the importance in groups of not only making public commitments but also private commitments. The second activity, in one that you ah, would be urged to do on your own or with your classmates, uhm, since the purpose of this and the, the lasting value of this particular video or this particular experience is not anything to do with the content or anything that I revealed to you, but more what a difference this makes to you in terms of taking some risks in your own lives. The participants were then asked ah, to partner with somebody who they didn't know and someone who's a relative stranger. And I'd like to ask, ah, you to do that right now if you're in the company of other people and with that partner to go off somewhere that's private and to spend sometime in the company of that partner. Writing yourself a letter, a letter in which you disclosed something that you intend to do, ah, that you wish to do, that you wanna do, and that you need to do in the next six months. And putting this in writing in a letter of at least ah, 1 to 2 paragraphs, and certainly not more than a page, and then I'd like you to sign your letter. And on the letter, write your address. And after spending about 15 to 20 minutes doing that with your partner, I'd like you to then uhm, have your partner help you do the same thing. So that each of you leaves this 30-minute exchange with each others letter and each others addresses. And the commitment that in, sometime in the next six months, ah, roughly six months from today in which you do this assignment, I'd like you to mail your partner's letter to him or her, so that he or she will be forced to confront what you thought was important today. The advantage of this activity and of the public commitment activity that was done just prior to this is uhm, to go back to something I said when we first began today and that is the critical importance that as group leaders, if we truly expect our group members to take risks in their lives, to take risks in our groups, then we have to be able to model that. We have to be convincing in our belief that this is important because of our own effectiveness and being able to apply this to their own lives and now for you to imply this to your own life. Thank you.
