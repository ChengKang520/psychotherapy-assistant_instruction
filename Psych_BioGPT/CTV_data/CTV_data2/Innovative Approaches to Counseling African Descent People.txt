Culturally-Competent Counseling and Therapy Sponsored And Produced By The Society For The Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues Division 45 of the American Psychological Association With The Support Of Microtraining Associates Part I: Innovative Approaches To Counseling African Descent People Demonstrations by: Adisa Ajamu Thomas A. Parham 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  Welcome. We're focusing today on cultural competence. And we'd like to start with today with our second tape. I'm Allen Ivey, Microtraining Associates. And as we begin, I'd like to introduce Patricia Arredondo, President-Elect of Division 45 of the American Psychological Association and Professor at Arizona State University. 

00:00:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Thank you, Allen. As Allen indicated, this is a partnership between Microtraining Associates and Division 45 of the American Psychological Association to society for the study of ethnic and cultural issues. We're very happy to be part of this series. This is the second tape in demonstrating innovative approaches for multicultural counseling from culture-specific perspectives. 

00:01:00
ALLEN IVEY  And I think this is going to be very important for all of us. I keep learning more and more about multicultural counseling and therapy. MCT can really make a difference in your life, it surely has in mine. And I think in this one, we're going to learn some very important new things. 

00:01:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO The participants in this particular vignette video are Adisa Ajamu and Thomas Parham. As with the other series, they will give a little intro to the vignette then to the demonstration and we will end with the debriefing. 

00:01:30
ALLEN IVEY And let us begin.

00:01:35
THOMAS PARHAM  (inaudible ), I'm Dr. Thomas Parham and I have the pleasure of illustrating for you today innovative approaches with counseling African descent people. Let me begin by providing some analysis and commentary on the notion of world view and what is African-centered world view is all about. World views essentially summarize the conceptual pillars around which are beliefs, perceptions, intuitions are built. World views really help us to describe the nature of reality. In an African-centered world view, this particular framework is supported by several fundamental principles and assumptions around which we organize our therapy to practice. These include first, the notion of spiritness. There is a spiritness that permeates everything that exists in the universe whatever is, is in the first place spirit. Secondly, is the notion that everything in the world is interconnected. It relates to the idea of consubstantiation which essentially means elements within the universe are of the same substance. Third, the notion that the collective is the most salient element of existence. And fourth, the idea of that self-knowledge, self-knowledge is the key to mental health. So, as we talk about the culture of African descent people, culture is not merely skin color. Culture is not demographics. Culture is not, ah, ethnic dress. Culture is not simply food. Culture is not simply not holidays. Culture provides a general design for living and a pattern for interpreting reality. And so as we work with clients of African descent, your task as a therapist, your task as a clinician is to try to understand what is this client's designed for living and what patterns do he or she used to interpret reality. Now, given that African-centered framework, there are several assumptions that I think are important where African descent people are concerned. First, we've talked about the notion of spiritness and that spirituality component is absolutely essential. And spiritness here is not essentially, ah, religiosity. The spirit we talk about here is really life force or energy. It really is about the notion of, of human authenticity and having a sense of one's origin. Uhm, the second, the spirit that is in down in each of us is comprised of a self-healing power. Each of us is in down with capacity to heal ourself. And that energy and that spirit does allow us to be in that healing It's important to tap into in the therapeutic context. Third, each of us is a seed of divinely inspired possibility that if nurtured on the proper context that seed will grow into the fullest expression of all that it's supposed to become. Your task as a clinician is to try to understand what kind of seeds, what kind of environment have been nurturing and growing this particular, uh, circumstance and experience that the client is going through and how do you tap into them. Fourth, there's a rhythm and an order to life. It is important I think that we tap into that, that we align ourself with those forces in nature. Fifth, it is important that everyone discover her/his own passion or destiny in life and align their consciousness with it. Ah, it is consistent with the African term ori ire, o-r-i, i-r-e, ori ire. It means one whose consciousness is aligned with one's destiny. It's absolutely essential that we provide an avenue to be able to align our consciousness with that as well. Sixth, the nature of African people is essentially divine and that divinity is not so much, an elevation to God-like omnipotence but rather it is reflected in the desire to be God-like and aspiration in terms of thought, in terms of affect and in terms of behavior. Ah, next, it's important to understand that as therapist and counselors what we really are, are healers. Therapists and counselors are healers. And as healers, we serve as conduits through which spiritual energy flows. And so, the healing and the restoration of balance and harmony that takes place, ah, in the session doesn't happen because of us. It happens through us. And so, healers participate with the clients in confronting their spiritual, behavioral, mental, emotional debilitations. The task of a healer then, is to heal thyself, is to remember the past, is to access the spirit and to confront the Maafa, the Maafa being that great disaster of death and destruction beyond human comprehension and convention. The chief feature of which is the denial of the humanity of African folk. And when they run into experiences that do that for them, you will in fact find them, ah, experiencing mild to moderate to severe debilitations. And so as we close, we also wanna understand that in terms of the nature of disordered behavior, disorder occurs when an individual falls out of alignment with or harmony with one's healing power, falls out of alignment with the global unit of social body, the collective from the community and falls out of alignment with one's consciousness that is connected both to one's people as well as one's destiny and purpose in life. And so now having talked about the notion of world view, let's see if we can invite our client to come into the space and demonstrate for you cultural-specific techniques in working with African descent people. 

00:08:05
THOMAS PARHAM  Well Adisa, how you're doin'? 

00:08:10
ADISA AJAMU I'm fine. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
THOMAS PARHAM Alright. 

00:08:10
ADISA AJAMU How you're doin'? 

00:08:10
THOMAS PARHAM Alright. Welcome to the space. Won't you have a seat? 

00:08:15
ADISA AJAMU Thank you. 

00:08:15
THOMAS PARHAM  Welcome to, ah, our session today. And, ah, I understand you've come to me, uh, in the capacity of wanting some support, help. Why don't you share a little bit about, ah, what that is? 

00:08:30
ADISA AJAMU  Really, I've been having some difficulty with, ah, graduate school. Does not really feeling like, ah, maybe I should be there or maybe I don't quite fit in, you know, Uhm, just really have some difficulty adjusting to life as a graduate student. 

00:08:45
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. So, we're talking about difficulty adjusting to life as a graduate student and, ah, at some point, I might wanna get into those specifics of that. I've had a chance to even read some of your paperwork that you filled out. So, I wanna thank you for disclosing some of the information that you've disclosed here. But before we do, I wanna set kinda your file aside, and I wanna shift focus for a second and talk less about the content of what brought you in. And I wanna talk more about the process dynamic between you and I. In our session, in our work together over a number of days and weeks and months, I'm gonna be asking you to share some things that are relatively personal. And in sharing those, Uhm, is gonna require, you know that you take some risk with me, alright, and that you trust me. But I'm aware that is I know a lot about you. You know a very little about me. So, what's important for you to know about me that would help you create the kind of space that would help you feel more comfortable and share some of the things that you're gonna need to share? 

00:09:55
ADISA AJAMU Uhm, giving, uhm, (coughs), some of the concerns that brought me here I guess, ah, one question would be, do you consider yourself a man or do you consider yourself a black man, will be... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
THOMAS PARHAM Ah. 

00:10:05
ADISA AJAMU ...important question for me. 

00:10:05
THOMAS PARHAM Ah, for me, I think I am, ah, clearly, ah, an African-American male. And so, my manhood is defined by my cultural identity as well, very clearly. 

00:10:20
ADISA AJAMU And what do you, what you see as your purpose in life? 

00:10:25
THOMAS PARHAM Good question. Uhm, my purpose in life I think is to utilize my talent, my skill, the attributes that I've been blessed with to try to, ah, be a healer, be a healing presence in other people's lives. But one of the biggest difficulties I think that we struggle with us African people is not so much self-circumstance... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
ADISA AJAMU Hmm. 

00:10:50
THOMAS PARHAM ...i.e. racism, you know, etcetera. But there really is the need for mental liberation. So, what I love about being a, a psychologist, a therapist, a healer if you will is my desire to really help people struggle for that mental liberation (inaudible ). 

00:11:08
ADISA AJAMU  Cool. 

00:11:10
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:11:10
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. 

00:11:10
THOMAS PARHAM  Uhm, I'm also aware that as we move to this space, you've talked about issues of graduate school. I can see from some of the, the tension in your face that, that there's a very, you know, strong emotional... (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
ADISA AJAMU Hmm. 

00:11:30
THOMAS PARHAM ...issues down as well. And as we are collective people, there, it is sometimes important to call on some collective forces that can kinda be here with us to share this space. If you had to go through confronting the issues that you're talking about and you could align yourself and have somebody covering your back, who would you invite to be with you? Who to walk beside you? 

00:11:55
ADISA AJAMU  Other than, ah, family and my friends back home, probably, I could think of, ah, people like W.E.B Dubois and Ida B. Wells and soldier and the troops(ph). 

00:12:05
THOMAS PARHAM  Okay. Since we talked about historical figures, Dubois, Ida B. Wells and soldier and the troops(ph), okay, any others? 

00:12:15
ADISA AJAMU Uhm, Malcolm X... (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:12:15
ADISA AJAMU ...Marcus Garvey. 

00:12:20
THOMAS PARHAM What about Malcolm's character? What about Marcus Garvey's character makes you feel comfortable? I see you get a smile on your face when you even mention their names. What does that do for you? (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
ADISA AJAMU That they were able to stand tall and persevere in very difficult, ah, times. 

00:12:30
THOMAS PARHAM So, if you have Malcolm standing behind your back, if you have Garvey standing behind your back, if you have soldier and the troops standing on your side... (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
ADISA AJAMU Hmm. 

00:12:35
THOMAS PARHAM It would help you to feel a little better? 

00:12:40
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. 

00:12:40
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:12:40
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. 

00:12:40
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. What about family? You mentioned that family sometimes walks with you to. 

00:12:45
ADISA AJAMU Yeah, uhm. 

00:12:45
THOMAS PARHAM Who specifically? 

00:12:45
ADISA AJAMU My grandmother, Janie(ph) Burley(ph). 

00:12:50
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:12:50
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. Ah, she was like kinda family matriarch. 

00:12:50
THOMAS PARHAM What was it about grandma? What was it about, you know, her position as a matriarch? 

00:12:55
ADISA AJAMU She, she was just very strong and determined and outspoken. 

00:13:00
THOMAS PARHAM A strong black women? 

00:13:00
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. And always won(ph), overcome any obstacle that run her way, yeah. 

00:13:05
THOMAS PARHAM So, she was strong because she persevered through adversities, it sounds like? 

00:13:05
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. Yeah. 

00:13:05
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, alright. When knowing that those people are important for you in life, what do you think that we could do to invite them into our space here, to have them share our collective space and, and be aligned with you as you struggle with whatever issues you're struggling with? 

00:13:20
ADISA AJAMU Well I know back home with the, with the fellows, you know, sometimes, we pour a little drink out for the, for the brothers who have kinda moved on so something along those lines would be helpful. 

00:13:30
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. In African tradition, one of the things that I, I, uhm, do sometimes is, ah, pour libations and what libations are, are, ah, a ritual. A ritual really helps to, to center our consciousness on the task at hand. And so in pouring libations are, it is really less a prayer and more of an invitation to invite some forces from the African collective to be with us in this space to do that. And so if you'd like, why don't we think about pouring some libations and invite the presence of those folk in? 

00:14:05
ADISA AJAMU Okay, that's cool. 

00:14:05
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. Uhm, I always believe also that, uhm, you sometimes are the best expert on who you wanna invite. And so, let me just partner with you. 

00:14:15
ADISA AJAMU Okay. 

00:14:15
THOMAS PARHAM And I'll ah, use the water to pour the libations here and, uh, invite you to just proceed. 

00:14:20
ADISA AJAMU Okay. Ah, I wanna give praise and thanks to God Almighty. Ah, I wanna give praise and thanks to ah, remember my grandmother Janie (ph) Burley(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
THOMAS PARHAM Ashing.(ph) 

00:14:30
ADISA AJAMU ...and also I wanna remember, ah, all those ancestors that struggled and died in the middle passage... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
THOMAS PARHAM  Ashing(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
ADISA AJAMU And also (inaudible ) movement. And I'd like to remember, ah, W.E.B. Dubois and Ida B. Wells... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
THOMAS PARHAM ...ashing(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
ADISA AJAMU Ah, soldier and the troop(ph). 

00:14:45
THOMAS PARHAM ...okay, ashing(ph). 

00:14:50
ADISA AJAMU And also just to pour drink for, Uhm, the next generation, those yet to be born. 

00:14:55
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, for the children? 

00:14:55
ADISA AJAMU For the children. 

00:14:55
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. So, you've notice in the libation we'd call on the Creator and invite his or her into this space. We'd call on historical figures and invited their presence into this space. We also talked about family, who do we wanna invite in the family. 

00:15:10
ADISA AJAMU Ah, Janie Burley(ph). 

00:15:10
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, Janie Burley(ph). 

00:15:10
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. 

00:15:10
THOMAS PARHAM That's grandma. 

00:15:15
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. 

00:15:15
THOMAS PARHAM (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:15:16
ADISA AJAMU She lives in Boston. (crosstalk) 

00:15:16
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. Ashing(ph). 

00:15:16
ADISA AJAMU Ralph Burley(ph). 

00:15:16
THOMAS PARHAM  Ralph Burley. Ashing(ph). 

00:15:20
ADISA AJAMU Leon Burley(ph). 

00:15:20
THOMAS PARHAM Leon Burley. Ashing(ph). Okay, and then we pour some for? 

00:15:25
ADISA AJAMU W. E. B. Du Bois. 

00:15:25
THOMAS PARHAM For Du Bois, Ashing(ph) we'll invite Du Bois presence in, too. 

00:15:30
ADISA AJAMU And Ida B. Wells. 

00:15:30
THOMAS PARHAM Ida B. Wells. Ashing(ph). 

00:15:30
ADISA AJAMU And soldier and troops(ph). 

00:15:35
THOMAS PARHAM The soldier and the troops(ph) Ashy(ph). 

00:15:35
ADISA AJAMU Marcus Garvey. 

00:15:40
THOMAS PARHAM Marcus Garvey, okay. Ashy(ph) we invite Marcus' presence into this space. 

00:15:40
ADISA AJAMU  And Malcolm X. 

00:15:45
THOMAS PARHAM And Malcolm X. Okay. We want back Malcolm into this space. And also we poured a drink for those yet unborn. 

00:15:50
ADISA AJAMU Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, in helping us to always understand that what we do now prepares a way for those yet to come. Okay. Ashing(ph) We'll make it so. Okay. 

00:16:00
THOMAS PARHAM  Having now taken an opportunity, we try to connect up with Adisa, to establish some rapport, to build some trust. What we'd like to do now is move into a segment where we'd try to facilitate his awareness and conceptual understanding, emotional understanding, spiritual understanding of what it is that's going on with his life. Adisa, I wonder, we were talking about the idea of difficulties in graduate school, struggling with some issues there. I wonder if you could share with me what some of those particulars are. 

00:16:40
ADISA AJAMU Well, one, the, the things that they talk about in class, the theories they expound upon, they're not, they don't seem to reflect anything that I'm familiar with. They don't seem to reflect my sense of cultural identity or cultural integrity. Even when I try to approach faculty and students after class, sometimes, I feel more like I'm an intrusion upon their own, their cultural space and, and sometimes it, it makes me feel like, perhaps, I'm in the wrong or a little bit disconnected uh, from myself, and so really just trying to find a place to connect. I don't find it in the curriculum or in, or any access with the faculty or even to my, my own cohort. 

00:17:15
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, is frustration a good way to, to, to ah, characterize what it is you're feeling, with the curriculum, with inter-access with faculty and students? 

00:17:25
ADISA AJAMU Frustration, alienation. 

00:17:25
THOMAS PARHAM  Alienation. 

00:17:30
ADISA AJAMU Even a sense of, like, you may be, graduate school is not right for me. Maybe I should be doing something different. 

00:17:35
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, so in addition to being frustrated both with the interactions, ah, of feeling alienated sometimes from the program, feeling like you're, kind of, distant from that. Ah, it sounds like there's an element of self-doubt that's creeping into the consciousness about whether or not to even need to be in graduate school at all. 

00:17:50
ADISA AJAMU Yeah, I mean, part of is just, I'm just not sensing anything that reflects me. 

00:17:55
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, okay. Why is it important for your experience in this program to reflect you? 

00:18:05
ADISA AJAMU Uhm, part because I came to school to really try and help my community. And, part because I just want to, to be affirmed, in a sense, you know, to know that my experience and the experience that the people that I come from are important and they have meaning. 

00:18:20
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, so there's a, there's, if I'm hearing you right, there's a part of your, your mission, your purpose in life that was about self-discovery, self-mastery, the learning, and why you're learning particular curriculum. Curriculum is not just important for contents, like it sounds like you expect to see yourself reflected in it so that you grow as well, but that growth is not taking place because of what? 

00:18:45
ADISA AJAMU Well, the growth is not taking place because somehow, by me being left out of the experience is somehow, I feel like my humanity is not being affirmed, and... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, okay. 

00:18:55
ADISA AJAMU ...that somehow, my experiences outside of the experiences of the human family. 

00:19:00
THOMAS PARHAM So, when you feel like your humanity is not being affirmed, what does that feel like? 

00:19:05
ADISA AJAMU I got, like a, like I don't exist, like I'm invisible. 

00:19:10
THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:19:10
ADISA AJAMU Like there's no, like my spirit is not there or being felt. 

00:19:15
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, so we don't get any affirmation on the spirit. What's it like to walk around and, and feel like nobody is paying attention, like you're just invisible, like you don't care, like you don't count. 

00:19:25
ADISA AJAMU Kinda like being in a, in a dream world. Like, like nothing is really tangible and nothing is real. And, and the only reference for your being is just, just me. 

00:19:35
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, okay. Let me, let me step back and share a piece with you, okay. Let me invite you to close your eyes a moment, there's some elderly wisdom in the African community that says, you can't walk where you don't go, and you can't talk what you don't know. Think about that a second. I see the smile. What's it, what's it bring to mind? 

00:20:10
ADISA AJAMU Just a, as like merely(ph) talking about my, my grandmother, Janie Burley(ph) just being able to overcome obstacles and that, part of my challenge, if I wanna really help my community, is also learn how to deal with difficult obstacles also, on my own, coz it's my own private life. And, even in graduate school, learn how to find ways to persevere, you know, through those difficult times. 

00:20:30
THOMAS PARHAM So, in acknowledging that you do have difficult time to struggle with curriculum, faculty interactions, your presence in, ah, in the, ah, program, it sounds like there's a recognition on the other side that maybe the struggle that you go through have a purpose. 

00:20:45
ADISA AJAMU Yeah, I, I got that from, that's why I smiled... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, okay. 

00:20:50
ADISA AJAMU ...I kinda picked that up, yeah. 

00:20:50
THOMAS PARHAM Uhm, as I listen to you talk about graduate school and your experiences there, I'm aware that, that your energy is really focused in, kinda, the critical negative end. Are you feeling that? 

00:21:05
ADISA AJAMU Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:21:05
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, okay. Uhm, and as you call on that strength, you know, we got the presence of grandma here, and grandma comes to mind when she talks about that strength. I'm reminded of another axiom(ph) a piece of elder wisdom that says, life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony. 

00:21:30
ADISA AJAMU I like that, I like that. 

00:21:35
THOMAS PARHAM You with me? Life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony. 

00:21:40
ADISA AJAMU Hmm. 

00:21:40
THOMAS PARHAM So, if we're talking about the critical elements, critical nature of your experiences, in graduate school. If we synthesize in the opposites and that energies in that negative direction, all right. What might we do in the spirit of those ancestors, and grandmother's, and other folks; to synthesize? 

00:22:00
ADISA AJAMU  Try to find some positives that balance up the negatives. 

00:22:05
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, any for you? 

00:22:10
ADISA AJAMU Uhm, well, the fact that, you know, I'm the first in my family to be able to, to go to graduate school... 

00:22:15
THOMAS PARHAM Huh. 

00:22:15
ADISA AJAMU That's a positive. 

00:22:15
THOMAS PARHAM What's that like. I see you smile even when you talk about that. 

00:22:20
ADISA AJAMU Coz it makes my mother and father proud to know that one day their son's going to be a doctor, the first in our family. 

00:22:25
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:22:25
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. 

00:22:25
THOMAS PARHAM So, one of the things that you can draw that sounds like is not only the pride that you take with uhm, you know, being the first in your family to do that and then one day you'll be a doctor and that they'll be proud but what sacrifice did it take on their part to help you get to this particular space. 

00:22:45
ADISA AJAMU I mean, you know, my dad works two jobs, my mom works two jobs. So, a lot, there were lots of sacrifices in my family, even in the church, my church. They're raising money for me to be able to, you know, go to school. 

00:22:55
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:22:55
ADISA AJAMU It's a community effort, yeah. 

00:22:55
THOMAS PARHAM  Okay. Still synthesizing the opposites, what are the positive that we see in struggle? 

00:23:05
ADISA AJAMU Just that, ah, my mom was telling me, they can't be difficult for me than it was for, when my idols, Dubois, who got Ph.D. in 1895. So, I gotta be able to learn from that example in struggle and perseverance. 

00:23:15
THOMAS PARHAM  So, as we think about the image of Dubois here, what must had it been like for him? And, how does that parallel to what you're going through now? 

00:23:25
ADISA AJAMU Well, I mean, it seemed like, so far, you know, for me it was, it's 1999, for him, it was, you know, a century ago. So, things must have been much, much more difficult, and yet he was able to get through it. So, he suggested(ph) if, that I can follow his example, I should be able to get through it too. 

00:23:35
THOMAS PARHAM  So, Dubois grew up in a time when it wasn't far off, kind of a, ah, that guy, saw the law of the land where it could almost cost you your life to even know how to read. It was scholar like that. It sounds like there's a recognition on your part that in 1999, things are difficult but it's not in the same kind of parallel to somebody like Dubois had to go through. 

00:24:00
ADISA AJAMU Precisely, yeah. 

00:24:00
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, okay. So, as we think about synthesizing the opposites, it sounds like we have some acknowledgement about how frustrating, how alienating, how disappointing some of your experiences are in graduate school. But sounds like one of the things that you could draw on for some of that stuff, healing power and strength is the recognition of both thee ancestors and the elders who've been to there before... (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
ADISA AJAMU Hmm. 

00:24:25
THOMAS PARHAM ...but also that there are some positive things to be learned from your experiences in going to graduate school. Okay. Now, we've had an opportunity to both attempt to connect with our client and to try to facilitate at when, as to help bring some understanding to his particular situation or circumstance. It's also important for therapists and healers to try to set specific concrete goals with clients that they can work on within the context of a therapeutic interaction. So, let's see if we can now turn to our client and invite him to set some goals about what he wants to do. Adisa, we've had a chance to uhm, talk about and understand your circumstances, situation in graduate school, the frustration, et cetera, that you feel, the sense of alienation, uhm, we've talked about curriculum issues, faculty-staff issues, uhm, you know, just the overall atmosphere in the department, you know how you feel kinda disconnected from that. Uhm, in our working together over the next several weeks, I think it's important that we set some specific goals. What do you see yourself wanting to work on now in the context of what we've talked about this far? 

00:25:40
ADISA AJAMU Well, I'm trying to look at the whole picture as opposed to just the negative side of the equation. 

00:25:45
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, so one of the things that we might be able to focus on is continuing to synthesize those opposites, okay, in a way that we not only focus on the critical aspects but always try to bring in the lessons about what have we learned. Okay, all right. And, we can do that within the context of our sharing; any other goals for you? 

00:26:00
ADISA AJAMU  Uhm, that if I feel like the curriculum is lacking, perhaps I can do some outside reading on my own. That might help, you know, bring some of those, those perspectives into the classroom. 

00:26:15
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, so, one of the things I might be able to suggest and recommend for you are specific references or other reading that might supplement what it is that you do... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
ADISA AJAMU Hmm. 

00:26:20
THOMAS PARHAM ...that might give you a more affirming sense, you know, of yourself within the context of a more culturally-specific curriculum. Okay, all right. In addition to that, I always think it's important for individuals to focus on, kinda, their destiny, if you will, or their passion. I wonder if you can share with us very briefly. What do you see as your destiny, what's your passion, what gets you excited when you get up every morning and say I gotta go get this done? 

00:26:50
ADISA AJAMU To help, ah, African-Americans learn to embrace their heritage and to, to learn to really, ah, affirm themselves, even if the society won't affirm them. 

00:27:00
THOMAS PARHAM  Okay. So your passion is to help African folks do that? 

00:27:05
ADISA AJAMU Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. How do you get that done? That's what you wanna do. How do you do it? 

00:27:10
ADISA AJAMU  Uhm, I guess to, ah, helping them reconnect with their own cultural heritage, their own sense of cultural integrity. Uhm, and, ah, and, and do my own processes as a healer, in training. 

00:27:30
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. So, one of the things that we wanna do, I think, in terms of setting a goal is, is try to keep you aligned with that passion, with that destiny, if you will, to both be a healing presence in the lives of other people but also help them focus on the development of their own sense of consciousness. 

00:27:45
ADISA AJAMU Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. And, so, that, perhaps, some healing in yourself can occur through you trying to provide that support and assistance to other people. Okay. Ah, when we started our session, we invited the presence of ancestors, elders, the Creator, the spirit yet unborn into this space, understanding that it's the collective that really, we draw our strength from. Knowing that you're gonna need a social support in collective, I think another goal might be, to think about developing some kind of a social support system. Since you think about your own environment and space where you're in, what do you see as a goal that we might look at to help develop that particular support system as well? 

00:28:25
ADISA AJAMU  Well, I would be very interested in, in, if there's any other, the professional organizations... (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
THOMAS PARHAM  Okay. 

00:28:35
ADISA AJAMU ...that, ah, address, you know, students with color in psychology. 

00:28:35
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:28:35
ADISA AJAMU  I'll be definitely interested in something like that. 

00:28:40
THOMAS PARHAM So, any suggestions that I could provide you that could, that could give you that sense of support. 

00:28:45
ADISA AJAMU It would be helpful. 

00:28:45
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, all right, all right. Any others? 

00:28:45
ADISA AJAMU Uhm, just, uhm, taking initiative to try and, and develop a task outside of the department. 

00:28:55
THOMAS PARHAM Okay, and that piece is really important. I'm glad you focused on that because sometimes our sense of support gets so compartmentalized that we think, ah, if it's not in this particular space, you know, it doesn't exist. And so, one of the things I would invite you to do and I'm gonna be inviting you to do as we work together, is to think outside of that space, of the department, outside of the space of the program, outside of the space of even the university that you're in, to think about ways in which we can develop the kind of social and professional supports to give you the assistance you need in, in helping you get through to grasp a program in good shape. 

00:29:30
ADISA AJAMU I like that. 

00:29:30
THOMAS PARHAM Okay. I wanna thank you for being with us today and, ah, really appreciate you being here. Any final words, as we close? 

00:29:40
ADISA AJAMU Nah, Just, ah, I really, ah, enjoyed the time and give me opportunity to get some things off my chest. 

00:29:45
THOMAS PARHAM Good, good. I will look forward to seeing you again. 

00:29:50
ADISA AJAMU Thank you. 

00:29:50
THOMAS PARHAM All right, thank you, brother. 

00:29:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  First, I wanna thank both of you, Adisa and Thomas for ah, pro, providing us this very, very rich ah, demonstration, but also the background in terms of World views and how that came alive in the actual vignette. Ah, we had a couple of questions and, and Adisa I'm going to start with you. Uhm, how did you experience this very uhm, culture specific approach that Thomas took to the ah, work with you. 

00:30:35
ADISA AJAMU Well it's very different than what I expected. I expected that it'd be very kinda clinical and detached instead it felt more like home, like I was talking to a friend, you know, 'coz in my neighborhood it is a real stigma attached to the therapy piece, it was very different, and it, it ah, was very comforting. 

00:30:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Okay. Thank you. And Thomas in your approach to ah, working with Adisa, would it have been any different had he been a woman, uhm, an African-American woman? 

00:31:05
THOMAS PARHAM Ah, potentially. Uhm, there are some universal contrast and principles, I think, that transcend ah, gender but is always a respect for that feminine energy that sometimes, you know, gives off a different vibe. I suspect that ah, as I would have given the same invitation to her, to say "what do you need to know about me?", what she wanted to know about me as a therapist, you know, ah, might have been different than what Adisa wanted to know and, you know, male energy, coz that male energy that we share is, is a little different... (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
THOMAS PARHAM Than what it might have been ah, ah, where his counterpart female. The other pieces are had we of ah, as we pour libations and that was a way to create that space for us here, into a line of those forces to be with us in support of what Adisa was going through, uhm, a, ah, another ah, client suggestion about what technique they want to use to do that might have been different, but also the people they come on to be with us in creating a sacred space might have been different as well. 

00:32:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO As well. So structurally, it may have remained the same but we could expect that there would be different content? 

00:32:10
THOMAS PARHAM Sure. 

00:32:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO as well. 

00:32:10
THOMAS PARHAM Sure. Sure. 

00:32:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Okay. Wonderful. Allen? 

00:32:15
ALLEN IVEY I guess I'd have a question for both of you and it really would be ah, "hey I'm white European-American", and I know a lot of people looking at this tape would be as well. The certain, I mean, what, what, what, how would we, me apply this stuff, what would you tell me, what would you tell me that I might particularly take away from what we've seen here? 

00:32:35
ADISA AJAMU I would say ah, authenticity. That ah. 

00:32:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
ADISA AJAMU I will feel comfortable with you whenever you share that you just didn't know. 

00:32:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
ADISA AJAMU I suppose you pretended like you did know that would make me feel like it was more, more genuine and I'll be willing to open up to you. 'Coz you. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
ALLEN IVEY So, there is recognition a difference... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
ADISA AJAMU Yeah. 

00:32:55
ALLEN IVEY ...would be part of it. Ah, I was particularly touched by the, the libations thing, and one thing I like to do in my own work is do what I call a community geneogram... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
ADISA AJAMU Hmm. 

00:33:05
ALLEN IVEY ...where the person sees himself in community, but one thing I got out of this is the historical spirit ah, that was invoked. Ah , what ah, what about that to mention how could the, I, I obviously, if I where to do a ceremony like that, I think would be little phony, wouldn't be very authentic. How might I come in with something that might be substitute for that or the, the appropriate? 

00:33:25
ADISA AJAMU I, I will say that uhm, the part with that (inaudible ) did is, is, let the client uhm, facilitate what they're most comfortable with. And so, you know, I got to mention back home, this is something that we did and so he just kinda tapped into something that are already did. So it was, it was invested in me, not necessarily invested in the therapist or the clinician. 

00:33:45
ALLEN IVEY Thank you. 

00:33:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO So that, that's great. You picked up in your cue in other words, in that way, Thomas? 

00:33:50
THOMAS PARHAM And that's worth, that piece I think is, is, a felon that I've(ph) released spontaneously. Uhm, I knew that he would need some support and as I talked about in the African world views and notion of spirit, you know that the spirits are here, that was one way of calming him down and as he talked about sometime at the corner we pour up for the ones who could make it. That is really ah, a replication of a libation ritual, that I thought we could really, you know demonstrate here. But the piece, I think, that Adisa said is a little critical and if we have a, a specific answer to your question in a piece of information for our viewers is traditional western training teaches us that expertise is defined by our degrees and Ph.Ds and out licenses. The part of what I understand is that my role and task as a healer, coz if he, first and foremost have to be humble enough to know that my degrees are insignificant in the context of trying to be a healing (inaudible ) somebody's life. And even if we take our own work, Coradus(ph) was very clear in his writing that, what we are experts on process, the best expert on the client is in fact the client, so what I was able to do was really enlist Adisa support and saying, "what do you do?". So as a White clinician, White therapist, or somebody of a different ethnic background, if you have a cross cultural interaction, part of what we have to do is be humble enough to know that we don't know everything. And so I invited the client to say, "Teach me. Help me understand what it is that you might do", and then lets invoke some of that into the, the healing ritual of the therapy session. 

00:35:20
ALLEN IVEY That word humble as I do feel humbled by listening and watching you working, and ah, also struck one thing I wouldn't take away which in one thing I really like is the positive strengths as you start, rather than what your problem. What are your strengths, I think that was to me, highly significant. 

00:35:40
THOMAS PARHAM Well in, in, in two thing I think for me were, were important there; one being able to invite him to, to quiz me, to question me, to try to create that sense of equity. So that, that the positive energy begin to flow evenly as we began to try to balance out that flow, coz we came in with the energy very unbalanced. 

00:35:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:35:55
THOMAS PARHAM Uhm, but the second piece was as I just listened to Adisa and he talked about the critic(ph) and the critical nature of his experience in graduate schools, you know, etc. It was very clear that that energy was flowing in way that was very negative and I'm trying to synthesize the opposite if I allow him to just be anchored in that negative of space. It doesn't really facilitate I think his healing (ph)and being able to synthesize that positive opposite and I hope what our viewers were able to see is not only when you start to moving that positive away, his all affect begins to change, his posture changes, his smile changes, his, you know, he just starts to feel more empowered and strong. And those are little clues you can see I think as a therapist, in the class that we work with, to let you know that you can get some of that affirmation. But he's doing as much a more work than I in this case. He doesn't heal because of me, he heals through me, I'm the conduit through which that spirit flows. Yeah. 

00:36:50
ALLEN IVEY I love that, the conduit to through which the spirit flows-
