ESTHER PEREL I'm back. Yeah. I needed to let you know the handouts for this morning are up. But, the handout for this afternoon will be up later. So, a lot of what I will be talking to you about will be summarized in major points, you will also get an article that I just wrote recently, that's called Erotic Fantasy Reconsidered from Triumph to Tragedy and you will get a bibliography and a list of movies and all of that. So, it's beyond my control, but it has been taken care of by my control, with my control. So, what I would like to suggest is how we can go together in this very short amount of time and prove the depths and riches of our erotic imagination, and particularly what our imagination is and what it can do for us. That would be the lens to which I want us to look at fantasy. You know, most people talk very little about sexuality and they rarely talk about sexuality with the person that they're usually are meant to have sex with. And if they talk little about what they do, they talk even less about what they're thinking about, while they are doing it. But, as a whole I would like say that sex isn't something we do, sex is a place we go. And it's a place we go inside ourselves and with another or with others. So where does it take us and where do we take ourselves through sexuality. Which part of ourselves are we connecting, what parts of us are we expressing, what kinds of experiences are we having with ourselves and with another or plural. But, you know in our erotic mind, even our solitary pleasures are always plural. There is always someone else involved even if it's another version of ourselves. So, by definition the erotic imagination takes place in the plural. Now, when I began to look at this whole subject and when I began to kind of look back if you want at my own education about fantasy. Pretty much what I was told is that fantasy is bread of the impoverished; it's for the people who can't get the real stuff. How many of you got that idea at some point in your education. Oh, you're very lucky. You know for me fantasy was often for the neurotic, the immature, the ones who won't grow up, the ones who are afraid of intimacy, the ones who need to go elsewhere. I mean, I actually spend many years not knowing too much positive about it. And certainly not how it could be used in couples therapy and certainly not how it could be linked with erotic intimacy in a couple, so, it's those connections. By the way another thing that, sorry for the other interruption, but I also was to tell you that this sheet around for the mailing list, but that those of you already put your name in the morning, forget about it and those of you who want to stay in touch, even though I don't harass you, you're welcome too. It will allow me to send you a few other things about the workshop as well. So, I look at fantasy as a valuable creative resource first and foremost. And in that sense, it's a resource that helps us transcend reality and it frees us from hatches of reality, but I put it in a positive spin rather than seeing it as not wanting to be there. I see it as being there or being in certain moments of reality is sometimes really painful. With the fantasy, I can remember my youth and with the fantasy I can remember your youth and with the fantasy I can remember the breast that have been confiscated and with the fantasy I can remember myself when my libido was different. It allows me to transcend the limits of what reality imposes on us and to open it up. And we have that gift that allows us to flee reality to create another one. It isn't always a negative, I am saying it, because so much of fantasy is been getting a bad rap about that especially in the context of an intimate relationship. I look at fantasy as an expression of our personal freedom mainly in the sense that you can force people to have sex; you can never force them to want it. And in that sense, it is intrinsically linked to concept of desire. You can go off in your head anywhere you want and in that it becomes probably one of the most intense expressions. It's what allows the prisoner to survive, it's what allows us sometimes to expand beyond the prisons that some of times we live in. Our own doing, not just the ones imposed on us. And they are mix of physiological and cultural pre-occupations, meaning that understanding what a fantasy will do for us, will help you better understand the emotional and sexual needs that people bring to their sexual encounters. A good fantasy states the problem and offers the solution says Michael Badar. So if you really understand the fantasy, you are often getting other person's truth at the level of bareness that you can hardly get at in any other way, because in our fantasy's we will pour our deepest wishes, our more persistent needs, our quest from omnipotence, our fears of desertion everything. Our deepest psychology will be metaphorically transposed into our fantasies, but with an outcome that is always bound to give us pleasure. Nobody suffers in a fantasy, even if the plot is one that inflicts suffering, the goal is always pleasure. Do you understand? If you don't make the connection immediately you'll just look at little kids who play. And in general, we tend to play with something that isn't part of our condition. Meaning if you are in jail, you really want to play prisoner. Do you understand? In order to play with something, you must have just enough distance that allows you to take back the original plot and turn it into a source of excitation and pleasure by virtue of your being the director, the author and the protagonist all at once, you create all pieces. Like in a dream, it's a psychic structure, and like in a dream working with fantasy is about decoding that symbolic structure. What Marin talks about that to me was very helpful in actually beginning to pay attention to fantasy and to do couple's therapy by working through people's fantasies, sometime, not all just one window, but it's the one I'm here to introduced to you today is that. Through our fantasies, we can repair, we can renew, we can undo and we can transform as well as we can avenge and we can compensate even if just for a moment. The inhibitions, the fears, the hopes, the aspirations, the yearnings that roll within us, all of that. So, it's not causing effect, it's not really, I feel invisible in life, so I create fantasy where I am irritable. But, there is a correlation sometimes, that we don't just find any kind of fantasy, we tend to find fantasy's that give us just the thing that we can't do in our real life. And the thing about fantasy that I also often was told you, that people want to experience in real life that which they would like in the fantasy, but in fact it's often not the case. So much of us, will get off at night on the very same things that will go demonstrate against during the day. The erotic mind is really not politically correct. It's a bit of lawless landscape up there sometimes, which is why it creates so much guilt and so much same, how is it possible that I would like this, this doesn't resemble me, and this isn't like who I am in real life. But, that is the reason why we have that space that we may or may or may not in act, but it is that space where we can actually go often to explore parts of us that we don't know go to exploring in broad daylight or that we will transcend the limitation of our religious, of our beliefs, of our conscience, of our political views, of our personal limits. It is a place, where we go outside of ourselves in order to experience deep parts of ourselves. You are all super quite, you're with me, it's after lunch, I hope you all had espresso, it's the hardest time. 

00:13:37
[sil.] 

00:13:42
ESTHER PEREL But in fantasy, we can often go and negate the limits that have been put up on us by our conscience and by our self-image and by the social forces that domesticate our sexuality. In one of the cases, that I was working with, the women is basically from the day she moved in with her boyfriend, she is no longer interested in him sexually. So for a while they think she is an immigrant, maybe it has to do with the green card, maybe it has to do with not like in New York, and may be it has to do with pressures of finding a job etcetera, etcetera. But then I find out that there is one-time or one kind of time when she's actually super interested. After a fight in the back of a taxi, on the bucket in the restaurant, you know, in public places, in places where basically it is really clear that she's not doing what she's supposed to do. She grew up in a very catholic family in Europe, in Spain. She basically learned that sex was for babies and it's a women's job to maintain marital satisfaction for the husband primarily and she wants sex that is for joy and pleasure and from the momentum she moves in with him, it stops being an expression of her personal freedom and choice but, it becomes that which is mandated to do by history and society and culture that women do and she no longer wants to do it. And he doesn't understand what goes on, because he'd really would love it if they could sit on the couch watch the game turn to each other and get started. And without much of the production and he -- so, then you get -- so now it began to probe what is it about the transgression that allows her to actually rekindle her desire. What is it about not doing what you want and while it happens that for her places like that are clearly not places where you are being complaint and obedient. And therefore, by definition, you always know more that you're doing what you want when you're doing what you're not supposed to do, breaking the rules is super-important in the construction of desire. Because, if desire is an expression of autonomy, for certain people, autonomy requires breaking rules, not doing that which is expected, okay? So, we translate, so that it becomes clear to him, it's not about the matter of liking production, it's that her erotic mind found a way to circumvent the pit falls of intimacy for her and create a space in which she could actually continue to want. And frankly, as in old cases, if these people had a good fit, and if he happened to be into the same fantasy with her, they'd never be in my office, they'd be in the taxi. You know, some of this only becomes problematic because there is not necessarily an understanding or a compatibility between the two people or at least, at first a perceived one. But then, what also becomes clear is that the question I ask her is if the forbidden is sinful, if pleasure is sinful, if pleasure is forbidden, how does the forbidden, then become a source of pleasure. Now Catholicism has understood that from time in memoriam. Okay? It understood that the transgressive is about a subversive way that you take something which you're not supposed to do and then you turn it into the very thing that gives you the most amount of joy and pleasure and I hope I get to show you that little clip afterwards. I wasn't actually thinking about that one, but it's an interesting one. Or, if I am working with this man I saw actually, you know, also this week. So, what happens in his fantasies that for him is about a women that is completely at his backing call, is that, in his life, he ends up feeling that he can never receive anything without having really sweated for it and then he needs to justify that it is maybe the commensurate reward for the commensurate effort. And so, he has a whole world up there, in which, not only that she do everything that he wants, but she doesn't have to pay for it in guilt, in death, in emotional death. The mechanism becomes all the time what is the problem that your fantasies solving for you in such a beautifully imaginative metaphoric way. Now, in general, I would say, it's sometimes very tempting for us to thing that erotic fantasies about plots and costumes and roles and characters and accoutrements and stuff. Erotic imagination, erotic fantasy is anything that heightens our erotic pleasure. The time of the day, the light of the sky, the temperature of the water, anything; it doesn't really have to be a set thing and that's very important because when people come in and they say I don't fantasize, it's often because they think that they don't have a whole theater up there and basically when, you know, you begin to talk to them what turns you on, what get's you interested what are some of your thoughts, what are some of the images, what are some of things that you respond to as a way to make them connect to their own desire to their own erotic-self, you begin to see that people have a lot of things that are part of the realm of the imagination, but they don't think of it as such, because that's not what is usually put in the category erotic imagination. Our thinking of this other guy I collected them this week, I told them just going to see all sessions, you know what do people actually talk about. So, I am thinking of this man who I'm kept asking him what is it about leather and what is about prostitutes real or imagined? In most of his life its actually imagined but it is about the person that you don't have to pleasure first. In my real relationship, in my relationship with my wife which is with for many, many years, the sense has always been that one way to save of the predatory fears is to make sure that she comes. But, now, the problem is that she no longer comes in the same way as she used to or nearly as often as she used to. So, if I don't give first, I can't take because one way I don't feel so bad about taking is because I have paid of my debt. With the prostitute, you never have to worry about that; you can just take veraciously, greedily and if you even go for real and you pay her you really paid off your debt in advance actually. So, it clears him of all the burns of emotionality, but more importantly it clears him of a lot of his predatory fears, which I think is one of the sensual themes in a lot men fantasy actually. Another guy who is into gangbang busters, you know gangbang busters? It's many men one women. And the reason we are talking about it with his partner and I hope we'll have some sense to watch some of these clips, but basically her sense is that it's all these men who have power over a woman. But, if you really enter the erotic mind of someone who is into many men one women, the whole fantasy is about an invulnerable woman who can take on some many men, her fragility is completely non-existent and therefore he doesn't have to worry about hurting her. The power is all with her in the fantasy of the men. But, you got to go linear at it, you can't just look at the external and think it's all about what's in visible meaning that the performance doesn't necessarily match the meaning of the performance. So, the session is about him telling her and why is he telling her, because he's leaving all these tapes on the floor. It's not been hidden it's been there with him before he ever met her and it's basically gangbang buster, one gangbang buster, two, three five, seven, fifty six still a man shows, it's all the same. You know, but it's all the same with different twist for him, but the same isn't the theme. I am the son of a women that was a divorced mother of which I was the caretaking son of which I always was tuned to every mood of hers, I tracked her I knew when I came in the house how she was doing I have been all them there and then separately, in this other space there created a place where there is this woman, basically the other woman, who can take on as many as there are all at once into her orifices and be filled up by it and not break and that sense of invulnerability becomes a condition for him to be able to let go. Because, -- and that's the problem he has with his wife, his wife is too nuanced and therefore has fragility that's why you don't marry that woman, because the woman the moment you get to know her, you always get to know the fragility of people so the fantasy can never last that's what he is explaining to her, at least for him. But the fragility of his wife makes it so that it becomes harder and harder for him to be able to let go with her and he's going to have to create another template in addition to the one he has. Most of the fantasies that are clearly edged that are real preferences that have existed in us for a long time, you don't make them disappear. No reparative therapies going to make them go away, but you can expand repertoire and add other template, other arousal templates, especially when they become more fixed or fantasized which is only the case in a small number of people but we worked the whole range, right. From a fantasy that can come every once in a while to one that becomes a necessity or one can know them engage sexually.

00:25:02
ESTHER PEREL When I look at the question about what a fantasy expresses in terms of the emotional needs that we bring to our sexual encounters, then it becomes very clear that it's very difficult to disentangle emotions from sexuality, meaning that even hit and run sex is never just sex. In some way, sex is never just sex or in another way, I would say there is never safe sex, because when it really touches you at your core, you are always vulnerable, which is why some of the most daring fantasies of people require the most amount of trust with a person with whom they can show that part of themselves. A lot of partners will leave with someone who will never know that side of them. Because, generally, our erotic mind is an absolute detector of censorship and knows when it needs to go underground. It feels judgment, it smells judgment and it knows when not to reveal itself. And that's totally fine, as well it's not always a necessity. Any of you saw Venus in Fur, the play? Has it come out here already? You know the book? Alright, then it's not relevant. Venus in Fur, Venus in Fur. Venus in Fur was a novel written by a German philosopher author Leopold Masoch and who basically coined the term SNM, it's Masoch and the S is Sacher-Masoch, and from there comes the word SNM. How many of never knew where SNM came from? That's one thing you can leave with today. Okay. Now, what is one of the reasons that people are often so silent about their fantasies is, look, if everybody fantasized about a bed of roses, it wouldn't be a problem to talk about it. But, what happens up there in this erotic mind is that we bring often all kinds of feelings, emotions needs that don't really go hand in hand with our feelings of love. It is kind of a darker side, its feelings and need and expressions of aggression of rawness of naughtiness of lost infantile wishes selfishness, jealousy, possessiveness. At best, we don't think that those are qualities that really create a beautiful love. But, they often are intrinsic to people's erotic architecture. That's why, when I'd work with couples, I always and especially on those subjects, I will often alternate between doing individual sessions and couple sessions. I do it in general as part of the way I see couples, but certainly when I touch on these material, and I tell people in the first session that I have an open secrets policy like Janis Spring developed, in which you will talk to me when you are seeing me individually and those will confidential sessions, in which you choose what you want to share with me and if and when you want to share it with each other, that's your choice. And so, that frame is set early on, but certainly in working on fantasy, offering people a private space where they sometimes have for the first time uttering it out loud and also making sense of it, understanding what they found there. So, in the first sessions if people come in to talk about questions of sexuality and relationship of erotic intimacy of lack of desire of hyper-sexuality you name it, I will ask people -- I don't generally ask people do you have sex, because that doesn't tell me much. But, I will ask people what the sex mean to you. What does sex mean to you, how important is it in your life, what role does it play, what does it mean to you, is it a place where you go in order to be able to be -- to back to this example, safely aggressive, is it a place where you can transcend yourself, the limits of who you are, is it a place where you're seeking spiritual union with another person, is it a place where you can finally be taken care of, is it a place where you can finally not need to make decisions because somebody else is taking you by the hand and you can give yourself over in full confidence, where do you go, what parts of you are you connecting to. Once I began to ask that question, I've introduced the fact that fantasy will become an implicit part of talking about human sexuality, not the behavior, not the act, but the experience, the subjective experience and the meaning that we give to it. What expectations do you bring to sex is what I am going to hear, I am going to listen for, and that's what you're going to see in this tape. Now, what happens also in our erotic mind is that it's not always an egalitarian space, it's actually a space where we often will go to deal with one of the most important aspects of sexuality, which has to do with power and aggression. Froid knew that and feminists have known that and one of the things that have happened is that we sometimes in trying to eradicate abuses of power have also tried to eradicate it out of sexuality. But, it doesn't really work this way. And my experience is that if we let people integrate this more rather than compartmentalize it we will have a lot less people having complete secret sexual worlds, of which their partners are cut off from when it is at the expense of the partner. I am not talking about erotic privacy. Couples who allow each other a lot of erotic privacy actually often have a lot more erotic intimacy. Do you understand that? Because, it allows people to stay in touch with their own erotic self with their own imagination, with their own fantasy, with their own responsiveness. And they can bring that energy to their partner versus couples who often only try to plumb the energy from each other. But, thriving on power plays or settle manipulations or unfair advantages or illicit aspirations, all of that is what makes it often more difficult for people to want to share their experiences. In the tape, I want to show you it's a couple in their fifties and he is a -- he was a policeman, now he works in securities, she was an emergency room nurse. They met in the emergency room; it matters, you will see why. And he grow up in a very catholic family. She had a father who was also a policeman, five siblings and a mother who basically sat on the couch watching Snoops and smoking cigarettes. Now, Snoops is one big fantasy. You know, even if nothing is shown, but that's the whole point of it. In much of great fantasy, it's all about what leads to it. That's where the charge is, not in the actual denouement. He tells me of a few key experiences for him. One is, one time, and that's where I am listening for the paradigmatic moments, you know, paradigmatic experiences that will shape the erotic blue print. One day, he sits on the couch with his mother they watch television, his leg touches hers and he has an absolute moment of terror, but the terror and the pleasure all meet in that one moment. And from there on, there is a and the earning for the tenderness that he wanted from her and the connection and the attention and none of that was becomes transposed and then becomes sexualized later on and he develops an entire fantasy life of older women and younger boys. Okay? He also tells me that he used to masturbate under the bed, watching the dust boards and that he after that began to develop a prayer which he has now set for fifty plus years, in which, he basically asks god to forgive him for his lustful inclinations. He never prays to feel that, to feel that he may be a criminal or a thief, its only about carnality. And so, I am going to of course ask him if there is a way for him to remain a good catholic and to change the prayer. Because, you want people to stay within the framework that is the values and the meaning framework that matters to them. And in real life, of course, when he would approach his wife, he would approach her and she wasn't always up for it, but instead of thinking that, he was needy, he told that she was withholding. Now, of course, in fantasy, there is no withholding person, they always want it, and just as much if not more so, and they say, more, more, more, me too. And they don't make you feel like you want too much, they are so delighted to give you exactly what you want. So, you never feel like you're needy or you want too much or you're a little boy. But, in real life, every woman that has ever been with a man who expresses desire not a desire but as something that is actually neediness, doesn't want to have sex with him, because many women will be very happy to nurture the little boy, but they don't want to have sex with the little boy. I see so many in audience here. We should look at each other. Okay? Do you understand? So, you get the glitch, you get and I will try to create a conversation with them, it's a one session that you will see, it's a clip of one session only, in which, I will try to have him understand that there is a difference between needing her and wanting her, but in his fantasies, he was able to take care of one by only experiencing the other but that doesn't work in real life with this woman. Now, this woman, of course, you always need your match, right? This woman grows up in a family where her paradigmatic event that she tells me is -- what I mean by paradigmatic is little experiences or meaningful, not they're little because, they are not little, they're powerful experiences that you can link to the shaping of the erotic blue print as in a formula that goes off in my head that says, tell me how you were loved and I will tell how you make love. That's another workshop, but what I'm saying is, I'm listening for how she was loved and what that did to her sexually to her erotic-self. The questions that go with that for her would be, how were you loved, by whom and how was it expressed. Well, you protected by the caregivers or did you have to flee for protection, were you allowed to thrive or were you always meant to close in, were you allowed to want, if you're not allowed to want, you generally have a compromised sexuality. Were you allowed to want as in, whatever it was a hug, a piece of chocolate and ice cream, you know staying up five minutes later, a new dress were you allowed to want or were you always told you don't need this. What do you need that for, you already have enough. If you grow up with you don't need is, you already have enough, you can very easily put that as part of a lot of people in this case of woman who will never come, because you will often think, it's taking too long, I've already had enough, he's had his own and it's done. You really need to feel entitled to want to take the time you need to get to where you want to go. You are nodding again. Okay. So, she, the questions about, were you allowed to experience pleasure and did pleasure have a value for its own or was it only something that you get when you really worked hard and you get a tiny reward at the end or what's pleasure, the ability to luxuriate to just be without having to do, without having to prove yourself was that a value in life, not sexually, just a value in life, were you allowed to eat for pleasure or for sustenance, was excess tolerated, excess is an intrinsic quality for sexuality and certainly in the sexual fantasy world, were you rocked, were you held, were you sued, or where you humiliated or violated or never touched or invisible and her story is a story of invisibility and the plot she gives me is one day I vomited the whole night I was a child, I was sick and I didn't want to wake anybody up because I was I didn't want to bother them and so I just dealt with it by myself the whole night and in the morning I left a little crumb on the corner of my mouth to see if somebody would notice. Now, you translate that into how does this woman make love. Okay. So, when they arrived to me, they have been to a retreat, it's a kind of workshop that I do with couples. And in the retreats, I tell people at the end of the weekend, if you have a chance come and meet with me at least once again later or meet with your therapist, but find a way of anchoring this experience, because we all know that many retreats have a two week high and then it fizzles. And so, she basically comes in a few months later, they come in and I see them for four hours, many of my sessions are two hour long at this point. And you will see like two minutes of the first session and then everything else is just the second session. But, she tells me that she always thought that what best part of what she told was part of the turn-on material and we are going to hopefully do something with that, have to do with bubble bath and massage my back and stroke my face and soft tender and that in fact to realize that this wasn't at all what she really wanted. Women much more than men will impose even stricter censorship on to their sexual longings. You know, they are more likely, generally people in sexuality are more likely to do what they think they're allowed to do versus what they really want in their intimate relationship, but women even more than men. So, she describes that in fact, she realized that she was into a whole different scene and now becomes the trick, you listen to it and if you don't immediately think you know what it means, because you get seduced by the accoutrements or by the toys or by the plot, then you begin to stay and you remember you ask what expectations do you bring to your fantasy. How does this fantasy answer your deepest emotional needs. Not -- and therefore, of course, it excites you, because that's a part of it. Then, I began to realize that in fact, what she began to stage was not at all about what I thought it was about. You could very easily get tricked by the plot rather than by the longing, the earning behind it. Okay? So, a fantasy expresses the problem and finds the solution. So, it becomes this forward space where the fear can be transformed into raciness or the shame into curiosity or the timidity into assertiveness or the helplessness into sovereignty. If he didn't want to ask in his erotic imaginations, the other women know exactly what he wants, if she felt guilty, if in her imagination she can surrender to a powerful, lustful other without having to take any responsibility for it. And what begins to transform here by the way if she had been into being mom, sexually liking to play mom, I would not have met them either. You understand? It's because, she wants a man, because she wants a man, period, she wants an adult man, she's not into that game. That, she wants him to translate what, you know, his childhood need into an adult desire, basically. So, let me take some comments and questions and then we move on. Reactions, yes, but you're going to need the mic brought to you. So, can you bring her the mic, please? Yeah. I saw some of you really struggled through watching the tape rather than come forward, so you could actually read. I hope you didn't suffer too much, are there real aficionados of suffering here? Yes. 

00:43:42
 At the beginning of this kind of work, what kinds of questions do you ask the couple to get them to talk about their fantasies, because in my experience, people will say they don't fantasize. 

00:43:57
ESTHER PEREL Yes. Well, look, there is a lot of different entry points, okay? It's a great question, but so I said, one of the first question I ask is what the sex mean to you. Okay? Let's say like this: a couple comes to see me, sometimes couples and more and more at this point do come to see me because they know I work in the area of sexuality. So, that already is more identified you know understand other couples come in for all kinds of other reasons and I then introduce that subject pretty much into weak one. I just say and how is the relationship sexually between the two of you. You know, in my mind, like Barry McCarthy says, if it's good, it probably takes up 20% of the couple, but if it's not good, it takes up 75% of the couple. And I happen to be a therapist identified now with this subject, so I get a lot of couples who have gone through a lot of good therapies sometimes without ever touching the subject. And then they'll come and they say this is the one thing we've never talked about. So, they come motivated, at least officially motivated, okay? But, in general, I basically just inquire, you know, how important is it, how satisfying is it and when I mean good, I mean enjoyable satisfying, I don't really mean how frequent. Okay? I pay attention to the extent and this is going to tell you something about working with fantasy on the extent to which the people have embraced a view of sexuality that is rather masculine, genital and goal-oriented. Five minutes before the real thing is called foreplay, followed by intercourse, orgasm and then sleep. You know, to what extent is it that progression and then from there, they can say we have sex, we don't have sex, you know about me and after Clinton, I'll bet I lose for what is sex. You know, so I want to understand the way they speak about it, what is their language, you know. Then, I will ask a question which is a mini exercise that I think we can do actually in which I will ask, because, of course, I'm entering to intrude a door of desire, right? I'm not entering to it, just because I'm curious about people's fantasies. I'm entering to it, because I really think that I will learn something about the person that it gives me a look inside, individual interest psychically and interpersonally that is unique, because of its metaphor, because it is not linear content, okay? And so I will say ask the question in a mini exercise, where you will pair yourself up, do it for two minutes with each other, you'll get a sense. Pair up, whoever sits next to you. Pair up, pair up, pair up. I'm not just going to tell you. Alright, we haven't okay. Now, you don't know yet what you're going to do together. So, just very briefly, I'll demonstrate it, you know, just so you have a sense of how this works. The question is, I turn myself off when or I turn myself off by. Now, that is not the same as you turn me off when and what turns me off is? We are at the holders of our erotic agency of our desires. So, I turn myself off when I do my emails before going to bed. I will repeat for you. 

00:47:47
 I turn myself off by worrying about the next -- I turn myself off by worrying about all the things I need to do the next day. 

00:47:57
ESTHER PEREL I turn myself off when I haven't taken anytime for myself. 

00:48:07
 I turn myself off when I don't take care of myself -- when I don't stop being mom. 

00:48:17
ESTHER PEREL I turn myself off when I worry about the kids. 

00:48:22
 I turn myself off when I worked too hard. 

00:48:27
ESTHER PEREL That's very different than you turn me off when blah, blah, blah, blah and what turns me off is tha, tha, tha. You know, so now you're going to do this back and forth when I do it in the office they do it and I write. I write it, just so that I can read it back to them, okay? So, if there is anywhere a three, a three people group here, then have one of you write it and if you are comfortable then we will read it. Do this at a level that you are comfortable doing this with, but have a sense of what it's like, because you'll see the kinds of materials that come up. What you will notice is this people, talking about sexuality isn't about talking about the explicitness of sexuality. It's a whole other place we go to resource ourselves and not getting tricked by what it's looks like. So, that's what she was trying to say, you know what is it about being blindfolded or being attached, it's not because she wants anything to be done to her unpleasant or forced or imposed, it's because when she's attached, she doesn't have to give back, in a life of a woman who for 26 years has done for the others, all the time and not even because she like it, but just because then she know she's good and she doesn't have to feel bad. That's a lifetime script for you, emotionally and sexually, okay? And that script enters into her pores, that script is on her skin, it's not just in her mind, needle just in her emotional life, it's in her erotic life. Okay? It will age her much faster. So, go, one, two, three. I turn myself off by or I turn myself off when. This is struggling, I'll ask him. Okay. Alright. Hello. Don't get too excited. So, hello. And this is only on the question of turning yourself off, what will it be when I ask you what turns you on. So, are there any, can we hear any voices, just what struck you what stood out, did anybody write that wants to read, I mean, let's just get some material. You want to just -- yeah. 

00:51:07
 It seems like come theme, that when you're in your head, like you're thinking about whatever and sort of being in the moment. 

00:51:17
ESTHER PEREL It's when you are thinking about whatever instead of being in the moment. However, people -- what is the assumption underneath this? That good sex should just happen spontaneously, right? 

00:51:32
 Yeah. 

00:51:32
ESTHER PEREL Like a dear sex smacking that falls from heaven while you're folding the laundry. The notion is, this is a strange idea, because this is notion that sex should just happen and you know whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has. So, no, it's not when you are in your head, when you are in sex, you're often very much in your head, but you're present in the head that leads to this. It's just as much of a head trip. The head and the mind is the biggest sexual organ we have, it's just that we are not distracted with another head with other thoughts. It's not about just being in your body, it's both, but it's very much is in being in your mind, but it's about being present to the very thing that you are actually doing. Okay? Yeah, you were going to say something. About how hard it was? 

00:52:32
 While we're talking it seems it's more likely for men to not be distracted by what's in their head or what's going on than women, but not wanting to over-generalize. 

00:52:42
ESTHER PEREL Okay. So, the idea is that the sentence here is that this person thinks that it is easier for men not to be distracted. All the studies, more interesting studies on male sexuality, which I really recommend you to read some of Marta Meana's work. Totally go against his whole idea. Men, no different than women, are affected by their internal life when it comes to their sexuality. Let's get rid off some stereotypes for a minute. If he is depressed or anxious or feels lousily at the work or feels like he is not done well or he's worried about something, his internal states doesn't feel proud or doesn't feel accomplished or doesn't feel whatever. The internal state for men and for women is no different in it's influence, the kinds of elements may not be the same but the internal state, the internal affect influences both men and women. The difference is that men more likely than women may sometimes turn to sex to help them with that internal state. But, that doesn't make the internal state not important, do you understand me? 

00:53:57
 Yeah. Yes. 

00:53:57
ESTHER PEREL Yeah. Okay. Marta Meana, M-E-A-N-A at the University of Las Vegas, who, I think, is doing some of the most interesting studies on desire and sexuality. Marta, M-A-R-T-A M-E-A-N-A. You were going to say something. 

00:54:17
 I forgot. 

00:54:17
ESTHER PEREL You forgot. Okay. Others? Yes. 

00:54:27
 I've worked with, individually with some couples… 

00:54:27
ESTHER PEREL Sorry. 

00:54:27
 …who would answer that question, who answered it with me, I get turn, I turn myself off when I look at the other person or look at the other person's naked body. I'm wondering how -- what do you do with that at that point? 

00:54:42
ESTHER PEREL Then I here is thing: if that is said in the session, in front of the partner, I do nothing. I think to myself, I'm going to talk with this person alone. There are -- I happened to think that certain things should never be said, because they will never be forgotten. I don't believe that we just that more revelation is by definition the direct route to intimacy. 

00:55:12
 But, you're asking this question and that's the main one that's coming up. 

00:55:17
ESTHER PEREL Yeah. So, that just said, it's just left like that, but I'm going to the second question. I'm going to the second question. First of all, you know, in my head, let me put it this way, I could interrupt this when I look at you, I turn myself off when I look at you, can mean, because you've allowed yourself to neglect yourself, because you have gotten older, because I don't think I deserve you. Let's not just go for the obvious, because I have not been good to you, it's not just the visual, I don't proclaim to know what it means, that's the first thing. It's an easy sentence to trap you. Your god thing is to think he or she it's -- this case it's a he or she or whoever, is looking at the other and doesn't like what they see. You know, but, of course, the other, so there's all the four pieces I have already added and what I would could also add is and when is the last time you allowed your partner to know that it even matters how you look like, because you don't even notice or tell them the difference. So, underneath that statement for me is an entire relational dynamic on the subject of attraction, desire and rejection. But, in the moment, I do nothing, because I don't know. And then, but I have, but I just know don't go for the obvious. 

00:56:52
 Now that I've had these people tell me individually, I'm afraid to ask the question with them both in the room. 

00:56:57
ESTHER PEREL Yes. Right, so what -- so, they have told you individually what, that they're not attracted to each other? 

00:57:02
 Right. Yeah. 

00:57:02
ESTHER PEREL Right. Okay. But, in the conclusion of that is what, I'm not attracted and rest of the sentence is what? 

00:57:17
 And I want to make this work for both of them. 

00:57:22
ESTHER PEREL No, no, no, you're talking about you. I'm asking about the couple. The couple says I'm not attracted to my partner, both of you have told you that in confidence about by themselves and the rest of the sentence is what? That's only the first part of the sentence. Do you understand? That's only the first part of the sentence. I'm not -- you know, I see quantities of couples who have no desire for their partner, who they think is exquisitely attractive, is no connection, it's not an obvious connection. They have something to do with each other, but which way it works, we don't know. Come on, some people have had the greatest sex with people they can't stand. And don't necessarily even think as so beautiful, but something else happened, what, so the next to view as a therapist, what's the rest of the sentence. Unless I know the rest of the sentence I cannot make any suggestion to you and any meaning of what needs to happen in this moment. You follow me? 

00:58:27
 Yeah. Yes. 

00:58:27
ESTHER PEREL Don't get tricked. And in the subject of sexuality, don't ever think you know what people are telling you. Ask again, ask again and ask again and don't take one word and fill in your meaning of it. You will not necessarily be on the right track. It's really sleuth, work, sleuth? 

00:58:47
 Yeah. 

00:58:47
ESTHER PEREL Sleuth, I love that word in English. You know, it's like, you know, with a flash light like that and you think you've reached a corner and now you go to another one. It's that's kind of, so you have to be super-present, don't stay general or you won't understand. And they will stay stuck for years. Yeah, where is the mic? Yeah, go ahead. But, I want to go back to that question, so you need to do part two of the exercise. 

00:59:17
 Do you think that 50 shades of gray is making eroticism and for women more acceptable? 

00:59:22
ESTHER PEREL Okay. Let's leave 50 shades of gray for afterwards, because that's taking me to another track. But, go ahead, and then I'm going to do part two. I want you to see where this goes. 

00:59:37
 I just want you to respond to him that -- would you bring he's saying you heard that in individual therapy from these two. 

00:59:47
ESTHER PEREL Say that again. 

00:59:47
 He said that he heard this in the couples where he saw them individually you would not -- probably I would think not bringing that into couples work until you knew more. 

00:59:57
ESTHER PEREL No, I would not bring this in the couple's work until I know more. I think that what I'm saying is there are certain things that I don't think one person should tell their partner. But, what I mean when I say it like that, it's as if I'm the police and I decide what should be said and not be said. What I'm thinking is, I said something about that this morning. You know, this is a culture that believes in explicit messages. It really likes black and white and it thinks in the moral cure in the candid nature of honesty as laying it out there. It has lots of words, get to the point, don't beat around the bush, say what you have to say, it exhaust directness. But, sexuality is a realm that is a lot more ambiguous, a lot more impoundable, a lot more indirect, a lot less unvarnished like that, to say to your partner of many years certain sexual truths that they may not really understand yet, I will often first make sure I know what we're talking about and then examine with them, how they can bring this into the conversation with their partner, but not throughout one of those things, you know, I'm just not attracted to you. One -- you get those lines, you know, this one, twenty years back. I had a couple yesterday. He told her 22 years ago that he didn't like the way she kissed. And that's the end of kissing for this couple. These things they stay with you, just like a birthmark from God knows what, you know. So, I great, this one doesn't work? Not as well. Alright, I'll upper mic myself. Up, two mics. Okay. So, that's what I mean by, I wouldn't bring it into that session, but I will write it. And then when I read it back in this instance he heard it separately, so it's a different story. Okay? But still, I'm repeating to this person unless I know the next part of the sentence, you know, if somebody says I'm just not attracted, then sometimes I may ask, you know, in what ways do you motivate him or her to become more attractive – that's already one thing, you know, because I find it always, you know, why do I ask that question, because the amount of people who have become attracted, you know, how would I say this, in the lot of the couples that I work with after affairs, it's extraordinary how one person instantly becomes attractive. There is no better weight loss. You know, it's a crazy weight loss, but there is something about suddenly the person takes the matter in hands and just stop because there was no motivation anymore, there was a completely de-eroticized relationship in which none of this mattered anymore. So, when you say I'm not attracted to my partner, I want to know what do you have to do with this. You know, I asked a couple recently, I said to -- what's one vulnerability that she grapples with, I said. And he said, the way, she doesn't always like the way she looks and her weight and all of that. And then I said, and what's been your contributions to that, in what ways have you been helpful or not. And he said, I probably make it worse. Now, if I didn't proceed with all of that, he could be sitting alone in the room with me and saying I'm not attracted to her she gained a lot of weight. That doesn't tell me the full story. Alright, I turn myself on when, I turn myself on by. So, I turn myself on when I go dancing. And I turn myself on… 

01:04:07
 I would say the same thing, dancing. 

01:04:07
ESTHER PEREL Dancing. And I turn myself on when I think about some of the great places that we have been. 

01:04:17
 I turn myself on when I have nothing to do. 

01:04:22
ESTHER PEREL When I have nothing to do. Don't you want to spend some time with her? And I turn myself on when I think about my excess and I turn myself on when I remember ourselves in the beginning and I turn myself on when I read a good novel and I turn myself on -- what you will notice is that often it's about how I take care of myself actually and how I take care and respond to the quality of our relationship. It's not -- sometimes it's when I see you and there is nudity and there is other more sexually explicit things. What I mean by explicit is, just sexual things per se rather than things that elicit sexuality. So, go ahead. I turn myself on by which is not what turn me on is or you turn me on when, go. Okay. Alright. I see we have time creeping in on us. So, what kind of stuff did you hear? Give me a few. I turn myself on when, by, what kind of things came up? Yes. By having unstructured time. 

01:05:37
 Buying shoes. 

01:05:37
ESTHER PEREL Buying shoes. When there is no kids at home. 

01:05:47
 Thinking about having an affair. 

01:05:47
ESTHER PEREL Thinking about having an affair. Going to the opera. A new venue, a new place. When I'm at beach, I have a massage, I dance, when I take this class. So, more? Any others? Yes. 

01:06:22
 When I did something physical. 

01:06:22
ESTHER PEREL When I do something physical. Yes. When I remembered the past between us, when I dress sexy, when I attend to my own sexuality, when I connect with my own erotic-self. If I don't do that, my partner can jump hoops, and do anything I won't respond the shop is closed. That's why I say to him, do you experience her wanting and he says, yes. I say, do you feel entitled to her wanting, and he says, no. It's very easy to complain about how the other person isn't interested in you, which she did for all these years. But, a part of that is because he wasn't interested in her, he just wanted her to be interested in him, so he could feel interesting. I want you to desire me, so that I feel desired and desirable is not the same as I come to you, because I really want you. It's not the same as when I ask you after an experience how was it and you are telling me it was really nice, because you really know that I'm asking you how was it for you versus how was I. And it's as please reassure me that I'm okay. Okay? So, I start with the question like this for example at which point at one point I can ask you want an example of a fantasy that came up recently. This couple comes in and basically he says to her no and he says to me I'm the women in this relationship and I'm going to give you some non-straight couples too just so we get this thing a little bit broader here. But, I'm thinking of them because it's recently done and basically she says, you know, we never talk about sex. So, I say you know, would you like to talk about sex. I said, you know I've never heard a couple wanting more sex by talking about the sex they don't want, you know, that is not the way you get in there. So, what is it that you in there in that space I'm talking about? So, then I said to her, would you like to talk about, would you like to talk about sexuality, so she says, yes. So, then she turns and she says to him, you know, we never talk about sex, so I realized that's not going to, that doesn't turned it around enough. And I say to her, if sexuality was the way you wanted with him, how would it be? And so she describes to me that it would be frequent he would want her it would be create imaginative playful in various places, you know, general things. And I said to him and what would you like if sexuality was good between the two of you and he describes. And then I said, I want you to think of an experience that you had where some of these things that make sexuality pleasurable and fulfilling for you were present, but I never said specifically with him or with her I just talked in general and then she says he go first because she has felt rejected by him quite a bit. So, he starts to tell the story about how… 

01:09:47
[sil.] 

01:09:52
ESTHER PEREL So, he – right, he said fun, exclusive, integrated part of our relationship uncomplicated and frequent. Okay. And then, he starts to talk, one day she came, she flew over, he waited for her at the airport, she was wearing short skirt, you know mini dress, whatever. I'm not particularly listening to the details, I want you to understand that there is a way that you listen without really listening, because you're not there to be titillated. So, I listen, and as he's talking what I'm watching is to see, is she there, is he there, that's the difference between the memory and a fantasy. A fantasy, by the way, often happens in the present tense, you're in it. So, at one point I say to her, if she wants, I said you know if you close your eyes, you'll see more. Alright? If you close your eyes, you'll more, you'll see the Copenhagen airport. I didn't say that, I just said if you close your eyes, you may see more to let to give her the permission to actually go back. Now, this is after a few years of really bad relationship between the two of them, right? So, he tells and he talks about how much he wanted her and how enthusiastic he was and how they went home and made love and it doesn't really matter. What matters to me is to watch her say to him I didn't even know you still remembered. And for him to actually, you know, be able to still fantasize to still have that fantasies, to still be able to eroticize them as a couple, which is an experience of hope. Then, she tells a story and she talks about how they were travelling and then she had met him on the road, they met on the trip in Asia and you know, he gave her a wonderful experience and she had her first orgasm, ejaculatory orgasm with him, etcetera. It really doesn't matter what the story was, but, again, I said, you know, if you want, you may find yourself going back there more easily if you close your eyes. Then, I said, you know, if you want to put, if you want to sit in a place that allows you to remember the story better, just sit the way you need to sit. So, they just kind of basically put their feet on the chair and you can see they're going, you know, on the memory lane, they're going on a little journey, because sex isn't something to do, it just a place you go. So, I want to see can they still go there, because if they can't go there, I can't -- I won't -- you know, you need to know if there still is a space they can enter together. Then, I asked him if -- how it was basically to do this kind of thing. And at one point he said to me it wasn't so comfortable, because, you were there. It was like you don't belong here. And then I knew we're okay. You know, because, that means they're ready to close the door behind them and they don't need my presence. That's another way of asking about fantasy. I don't ask people talk about your fantasies. I do if I have a person like yesterday the one with the couple with the kiss. You know, and he basically for many years has been on porn, has done his masturbation, he's into some much more rough, raw, edgy stuff and he has an enormously powerful spiritual artistic connection with his wife. But, they have sex as he says maybe eight times a year and basically she then says I don't think he has ever been fundamentally I don't think he is ever been attracted to me that is not what I was about for him. And meanwhile, in order not to rock the boat, she has put her entire sexuality in a storage place and hope that she won't come up with too much, so that it won't create disequilibrium they have a four and an eight year old. And so, then I began to talk and he basically reached a point why now. You always asked a couple why are you here now, today, you know, you've done this for all these years and somehow it has been okay between the two of you. And we know there is a not-an-okay moment which is called 52 and at one point he gets up one day and he says, is this it or the woman vex up or any person for that matter, one point, gets up and says is there more or will this be the rest of my life for the next 25 years. And so I really praise them for their courage to actually come and share the question is this it with me and let's see together if there is more. And so the first more here becomes for this woman to not every time she thinks about sex, she thinks about the sex he wants and she actually does no longer have a connection to her own sexuality. But, then she started to talk about, you know, the interesting thing is this, we are both narcissist, his whole thing is about, you know, these women who are all about him, because he found very early on that he didn't think he's penis had the right size and so he never felt that he any other lot of predatory feelings and fears. And so, his whole thing was about women come on to him and want him and they are not necessarily the good girls and he doesn't have to worry about them, but he didn't marry that one, of course. And she finds herself with the wanting actually someone who is equally totally delighted about giving to her and not about somebody who just wants him, so that he can feel so good about him. So two narcissists wanting the other people saturation makes for a lousy sexual relationship, right? In their fantasy thing, so she starts to talk about the firemen. You know, she, but she uses it not as a real thing, as a metaphor for I actually want someone who would be delighted in making me feel good and not the one who gets off on somebody who is all into it by herself wanting him. I need you to make, you know, you are wanting me, makes me wants it. I, another person, who starts with the wanting it on its own terms. So, then I said, you know, you need a new space to have conversations about this and we introduced of texting email because he travels a lot. And so, I figured you have lots of long distance sex possible. And we're going to make that space come to life, right? The space that love worked so hard to close, desire is going to work so hard to open back up and bring back to life. There would be an introduction to working with fantasy and I wish you all well. Thank you.
