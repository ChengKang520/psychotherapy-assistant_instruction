Introducing Listening and Counseling Skills 

00:00:00
Maureen Moore, Integrative Psychotherapist 

00:00:15
MAUREEN MOORE This is the first of a series of films to support the teaching and learning of active listening and counseling skills. Listening effectively is a very, very useful skill in all walks of life. People needing to talk about personal and difficult concerns in their lives can find that task very, very scary. However, if the listener is genuinely interested, is non-judgmental, that makes the task so much easier. This DVD introduces active listening skills in a non-counseling context. The DVD shows a day in the life of Mary and her son. Mary has a difficult start to the day, and then has to go to work. She finds when she is at work that she can't concentrate. She goes in to see Louise, who's the HR Manager, and spends a half hour talking to Louise in the hope that she can perhaps feel a bit better and able to concentrate at work, as well as finding some way of coping with the difficulties at home.

00:02:05
MARY Sean! 

00:02:05
SEAN Morning. 

00:02:05
MARY What is this? 

00:02:10
SEAN This is the best tune ever. It's just came out. It's great isn't it? 

00:02:10
MARY It's first thing in the morning. 

00:02:15
SEAN Any milk left? 

00:02:15
MARY No, there isn't any milk left. 

00:02:15
SEAN Why not? 

00:02:20
MARY Because you and your friends drank it. 

00:02:20
SEAN But there's always milk in the fridge. 

00:02:20
MARY Look I've been providing milk for like 19 years. Don't you think it's about time that somebody else kind of like noticed what was happening to the milk? 

00:02:30
SEAN Yea, but I can't afford milk. 

00:02:30
MARY Sean, would you turn the music off? 

00:02:30
SEAN Why? It's the best! 

00:02:35
MARY It's first thing in the morning. I'm on my way to work. I do not need to be listening to this first thing in the morning. Don't give, do not look at me like that! 

00:02:40
SEAN Why not? 

00:02:45
MARY Sean, we'll have to talk about this later because I have got to get to work now. 

00:02:45
SEAN Sure we'll talk about it later. I'm sure we will. 

00:02:55
[sil.] 

00:02:55
Scene 2: Mary reflects on her relationship with her son. 

00:03:10
MARY Oh Sean, he just never listens to me. I just don't know what I'm going to do about him. I can't get him to pay any attention to anything. Would you look at that. I used to take him to this park. I used to put him on this swing. He was such a sweet child. I just don't know what happened between us. I don't know where it went wrong. Well, I better get on to work. 

00:04:05
[sil.] 

00:04:05
Scene 3: Sean tries to talk to a friend about his relationship with his mother. 

00:04:25
SEAN How are you, Si. 

00:04:30
RUSS Are you up mate? 

00:04:30
SEAN No man, no, I'm going mad, I'm going mad. My mom's just driving me crazy, man. It's like, you know, I'm playing my tunes this morning, just as I do, come into the kitchen this morning. Not even a hello, you know, just starts nagging, nag, nag, nag. I bet you I come home tonight and the first thing she'll do is nag again, you know. Whatever I do, she just has a go. I just, it's just too much. 

00:04:50
SIMON Ah, just don't worry about it. 

00:04:55
SEAN It's just, it's easy for you to say man. In your house, there's your dad, there's your brothers. You know, she can kind of shout at all of you, you know. It's like I'm the only one in the house so she, whatever she's angry about, she'll just have a go at me for it, you know. It's just comes out on me. It's just, just too much, too much. 

00:05:10
SIMON Oh no. 

00:05:15
SEAN What is it? 

00:05:15
SIMON I just lost my high score on here. 

00:05:15
SEAN What? Well that's what you've been doing while I'm trying to talk to you? Forget it man. 

00:05:25
SIMON See you. 

00:05:30

Scene 4: The helping relationship 

00:05:40
LOUISE Come in. Hi Mary, come in. 

00:05:45
MARY Uh, yea, hello Louise. Um, Paul suggested that I would come and see you. 

00:05:55
LOUISE Yes, come in, have a seat. 

00:05:55
MARY Uh, I am just not able to work today. I can't settle down. I can't focus. Um, and Paul thought it would help if I came and saw you. 

00:06:10
LOUISE All right, okay. I've got about a half an hour to spare. Would you like to use that time to just tell me how you feel and what's happening? 

00:06:20
MARY That would, I think that would be really helpful, Louise. I think that would be great, yea. 

00:06:25
LOUISE Okay, well this is not going to be a counseling session, but I can give you this time for me to listen to you and hear what the difficulties are, and for us to just see what we can do to help you feel a little bit better. 

00:06:45
MARY Yea, that would be great, yea. 

00:06:45
LOUISE Is that okay? 

00:06:45
MARY Yea. I would, I would like that, yea. 

00:06:45
LOUISE Okay, um, before we start, I just need to let you know that the conversation that we have will be in confidence. However, if there's any indication that you are in danger or that anyone else is in danger, then I won't be able to keep that confidential. Is that okay with you? 

00:07:10
MARY Yea, that's fine. I mean, you know, I might be upset, but I don't think I'm dangerous yet. 

00:07:15
LOUISE Okay. We'll have about a half an hour, and before we end, I'll let you know that we are coming up to the finishing, okay? 

00:07:25
MARY Right. 

00:07:25
LOUISE And then we can think about what you want to do next. 

00:07:35
MARY Okay. Thanks Louise. Fine. 

00:07:35
LOUISE Okay. 

00:07:40
MAUREEN MOORE In this session, I play the part of Louise, who's the HR Manager. You'll notice that when Mary comes into the room, I welcome her and invite her to share her story with me. I can't assume that she wants to tell me everything or even that she wants to use the time. I first have to ensure that the environment feels safe and that I seem to her to be someone that she can trust. When I know that Mary is willing to stay and talk to me, then I invite her to sit and spend some time telling me her story. In order to do that, I outline what is going to happen in the session, how long the session is going to be, and the nature of the help that I can give her. As an HR Manager, I'm not a counselor, and therefore I cannot mislead her into thinking that that is what is going to happen. One of the ways of ensuring that Mary feels comfortable with me is by using encouraging and facilitating body language. Leaning forward, attuning to her pace and her tone, using comfortable eye contact, and then some verbal and nonverbal encouragers. Having assured myself that Mary is willing to tell her story, I outline exactly what the session is going to be like for her so that she knows what to expect, what's going to happen during the session, how long the session will be, and what will happen at the end. And then I tell Mary what my role is. I don't know what she is expecting, and therefore to avoid confusion, I'm making clear that I'm not a counselor, but that I'm willing to listen to her and for us to work together towards an outcome that she will name and establish. I have to tell Mary what I can keep confidential and what I can't, and when she is clear about that and she has agreed to continue with her story here, then we can carry on with the session. In this next section, Mary begins to tell her story. I'd like you to notice the skills I use to encourage Mary to share her concerns with me. 

00:11:05
LOUISE In your own time, Mary, just tell me what's happening and how you're feeling. 

00:11:15
MARY Well, I am very annoyed with my son. I am, this morning, I mean it's just like I mean, I'd love to be able to say it was different, but there's nothing different. That's actually what the problem is, is exactly the same, right. I get up in the morning. All I want to do is have a cup of tea in peace, and what do I have? I have this thump, thump, thump, thump and his music in the background you know just, it's so intrusive, it's so annoying, and then he comes in and it's like he like goes to the fridge. He's like oh, where's the milk? And it's like there isn't any milk left. There isn't any milk left 'cause himself and his mates have had all the milk. But it's just that kind of thing like you know, I'm supposed to just sort of instantly provide the milk because he decides that he wants milk. So we end up having this run, and I mean, when I'm trying to tell you, it just sounds stupid but I have absolutely had it up to here with the whole thing. Just, I just reached the end of my tether with it. 

00:12:05
LOUISE Yea, I can see that you're really, really agitated about this. What do you think you want to get out of this time here? 

00:12:20
MARY I mean, it's like what can you do in a half an hour, Louise, like it's like let's face it, it's like really I just, I want him to kind of, I just want him to change. I want him to stop treating me like I'm some kind of unpaid skiffy. I want him to get off his backside and go and do something with his life. I want him to stop sitting 'round all day like he thinks that's what his life's about. I want him to stop, you know, I want him to change. I want him to change what he's doing. I've had enough of how he behaves towards me. I find him really out of order. 

00:12:50
LOUISE So in, in this half an hour, you want your son to change. 

00:12:55
MARY Well, you know when I say it, it sounds a bit ridiculous, Louise, and I hear that, but it's just, there is a part of me going, I am absolutely at the end and that's why I can't focus on work 'cause it's just, it's running through my head all the time, and I'm looking at it, going, I've had enough of this. I've absolutely had enough. I don't want this anymore and I don't, you know, it just sort of feels like it's been like this for such a long time, ever since he left college last year and refused to go on. 

00:13:25
LOUISE So you, you're at the end of your tether and you've had enough. 

00:13:30
MARY Absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:13:30
LOUISE Okay. 

00:13:35
MAUREEN MOORE In this scene, I invite Mary to start telling me her story. Notice that although Mary has a lot to say, I don't interrupt her. I allow her the time to continue speaking. And again, I continue to use nonverbal encouragers so that she knows that I'm listening to her although I'm not speaking over her or waiting and anticipating for her to stop. The other skills that I use in this session are reflecting feeling and reflecting words. It is really important to reflect feeling for several reasons. One, it indicates to the client that you are listening and that you are trying to understand how they feel. That is the thing that's most important to them. Mary didn't say she was agitated, but she communicated agitation by the movement of her hands, by the tone of her voice, and by what she said, and she now knows that I understand and I am aware of how she was feeling. I also used her words. This is sometimes called restating. Some people even call it parroting because you are repeating a client's words exactly. Here, you haven't got to interpret their words, but it allows the client to hear again exactly what they have said and often it makes them think, think again about the meaning of what they have just said. I then invite Mary to tell me what she would like to gain from our work today. The goals that she expresses or suggests might not be achievable, but at least we would have an idea of the direction in which we are travelling together. I wonder if you can think of a way of encouraging Mary to formulate a reasonable goal for this session. 

00:16:25
LOUISE I hear, Mary, that you're fed up and you want something to change. We've got a short time. What would be reasonable today? 

00:16:45
MARY Well, I mean, I think it's, you know, just to even like explain to somebody what's going on and talk about it 'cause I haven't brought it into work before. I've just kind of done my best to just kind of like make a split between home and work. And it's now affecting my work in no uncertain terms, so there is, you know I suppose as an immediate thing, I'd like to be able to come out of the room and be able to do my work for the day. 

00:17:05
LOUISE Okay. 

00:17:05
MARY You know, in the long term, I want things to change at home, but just for now, I need to kind of get to a place where I can actually do a day's work. 

00:17:15
LOUISE So, if at the end of this time together, you feel as if you are able to go back to your desk and do some work, would that be helpful? 

00:17:25
MARY That would be, yea, that would be an im-, you know that would take me to where I want to be right now. 

00:17:30
LOUISE Okay, okay. So what I understand is that although things are really bad at home, what you want now is to be able to concentrate at work, and then go back home and cope with your son. 

00:17:50
MARY If that possible, that would amazing to be honest with you 'cause I just, that, that's where I'm at as I've just said. It's like I really can't handle him anymore. I've just, I've just had enough of how he behaves. And um, I just can't work out, you know, I don't, I feel completely powerless to do anything about it. I feel completely, you know, it just is the way it is and I'm tired of it, and I don't want it like that and I just don't feel like I can do anything to make it different. 

00:18:15
LOUISE Mary, what I'm hearing from you is that you're feeling powerless. You can't do anything, and I'm beginning to, to wonder whether you are moving away from the situation because you can't, you feel you can't manage it. Is that...? 

00:18:35
MARY I'm not quite sure what you mean when you say moving away from the situation, 'cause I just feel like it's completely inescapable. I mean everyday I've got to listen to that what he calls music and every day I have to put up with the fact that all his mates come 'round and treat my house like it's a flipping hotel and I've got to put up every day with how rude he is to me. So it's like you know, I, I, you know, that's the situation. I don't, you know, I don't sort of see, you know, what part of, what makes it a problem is that I can't escape it. I can't, you know, like part of me would like to run away from it, to tell you the truth. Part of me would just like to kind of like shut the door and forget he's there. 

00:19:15
LOUISE All right. 

00:19:15
MARY And I think that in some ways was what, you know, is that what I haven't been able to do today which is what I can normally do is kind of go shut it, you know and on the walk to work, which is a lovely walk and normally on the way to work, it's just like you know I go from being one person to being a different person. And this morning, I suppose what happened was when I walked through the park, I just suddenly had this, you know I remember when we did get on. You know, it hasn't always been like this. It feels like it's always been like this, but there was a time when we got on with each other. There was a time when we were close. He was an absolutely, you know, a very sweet child. He was lovely when he was a kid, so I think it's something about that, like what happened to me when I got as far as the park this morning, is the bit that left me going, I can't just shut it out anymore. 

00:20:05
LOUISE Yea. That feels very painful. That feels really, really sad, that you were with him this morning. Things were really, really bad between you, and then during the process of getting to work, you had this kind of sense that there was a time when things were good and you wanted to be back there, but you're now powerless. 

00:20:30
MARY Yea, well it's just like, yea right I wanted to be back there. It's, I just, and I feel hopeless as well. I just feel like until such times as he actually recognizes that he's got to grow up and get you know, you know I don't, you know, does he expect for me to provide for him forever? Does he think he just gets to sit at home and lie around in bed all day and like listen to music and play music and is that it? Is that, you know, and I can't seem to get across to him that, that I, you know, that something has to change. And it's like, when they're a child it's different. It's like, you know, it's much easier somehow. 

00:21:05
LOUISE You said just then Mary, that he's got to realize that something has to change. Can you say what you're thinking about? 

00:21:15
MARY Well, I feel like, you know, I think he has to change how he behaves towards me. I don't think I don't think it's, I don't think it's all right for him to behave towards me the way he does. I don't think it's okay for him to be as rude to me as he is. I don't think it's okay for him to just expect me to endlessly provide for him and him do nothing in response. You know, I just, I feel like the way he is now is like, he's not, you know he's just kind of like, he's just quit. He's kind of given up, he doesn't, you know he's got no intention of going on in education and he's a bright lad, you know. I mean it's not like he couldn't if he wanted to. But he's got no intention of doing that. He's just completely obsessed with like what he calls music, which as far as I'm concerned is just noise. 

00:22:10
LOUISE So what I understand is that the situation at home is just intolerable because of the music, because of his attitude, because he's not participating or even meeting you halfway in the house, in the care of the home, and you are really, really frustrated. 

00:22:30
MARY That's, you, you've got it. Absolutely, that is absolutely how it is. I can't work out what I am supposed to do to get across to him that it's like, you know, he's 19, he's suppo-, you know in theory he's an adult. But he, you know it's like as far as he's concerned, being an adult just means that he can do whatever he wants to do, and that is not what adulthood's about. He's got to take some responsibility. He's got to, you know, when you said, meet me halfway, it's like, god, well, don't I just wish. 

00:23:10
LOUISE Why don't we just kind of stop for a moment and just be aware of what it feels like when someone can't meet you halfway, is so irritating, and is causing you so much angst. Let's just stop and focus on that for a little while, just notice what that feels like. 

00:23:40
[sil.] 

00:23:45
MAUREEN MOORE We begin this section with Mary clarifying exactly what she wants to achieve today. This makes her goals realistic and achievable. Something we can work towards. Again, I use the skills of reflecting meaning and reflecting feeling. I also use reflecting precise words used by Mary. At one point, when I reflect feeling, I seem to get it slightly wrong. That does happen, and it doesn't mean that I'm doing something wrong. It actually helps Mary to be even more clear about what her meaning is. As she corrects me, she clarifies in her mind what she wants to say. When I reflect feeling, that seems to have some impact on Mary and I follow that by checking what it is she actually wants to change in her relationship with her son. This is called clarifying because I am not sure and I wonder whether Mary is sure. So I ask her to clarify precisely what she means by the words she has used. Towards the end of this section, I validate Mary's feelings and emotions by communicating my empathic understanding. This is critical to Mary, to know that I really am trying to understand her feelings and the content of her story. Without that, she will wonder what has been happening during the listening session. It also means that she knows that she's speaking to someone who is feeling and is a person and is not just listening to her in some mechanical way. I invite Mary to stop and just be silent for a while so that we can both reflect on what has happened and become sensitive to the feelings, both physical and emotional, in the moment. I wonder if you if you could think about the benefit of keeping silent in a helping relationship, and also just how difficult it is to hold that silence. 

00:27:20
MARY So, how does it feel, and I feel trapped. I feel like I really have not a clue what to do. I feel like I did when he was a baby and I couldn't stop him crying, you know. I feel that kind of same sense of like, I don't know what you do. I don't know what to do, I don't know how I can handle this better than I'm handling it, and I can see I'm not handling it very well at all. And it feels that we just more and more and more locked into this thing that the second we walk into a room with each other, it arrives in the room before we've opened our mouths. 

00:28:10
LOUISE Yes, yes, now you've got this, your hands together and it's, it's helping me to, to really understand how close you are but that that is a very kind of difficult relationship. It's just feels 

00:28:30
MARY It's just that when you say we're close, it's like I, I, that's kind of interesting 'cause sometimes I just feel like we're like on two different planets. We might be like living in the same house but we're actually not inhabiting the same worlds at all, 'cause I haven't got, I haven't got a clue what he thinks, what he imagines is going on, how he, how he sees his life progressing, you know whether or not, and you know, I think that's part like I'm scared for him. You know, along with everything else, I'm afraid for him 'cause he just doesn't you know I can't see him, he doesn't see anything the way I see it, and I don't see anything the way he sees it. Oh dear. It's funny saying that because I realize how true it is when I say it, you know. It's different worlds, like 

00:29:15
LOUISE Two different worlds. 

00:29:20
MARY Two different worlds coexisting with each other. 

00:29:25
LOUISE Mary, we've got about five or so minutes left and I'm just wondering what you've got from this session that might be helpful to um, to get you back to your desk working, which is one of the goals, but also to help you to bring the two worlds closer together. 

00:29:55
MARY Well, um, I'm actually, I mean I'm actually surprised by how much it's helped me to talk to you. And how much calmer I feel for having actually kind of just said, this is what it's like because as I say, I've kept the two, I've kept what goes on at home and what happens at work very separate from each other so I feel like it's actually made a big difference to talk to somebody. And I, and I kind of feel a bit like, well, you know you've asked me about my world and, and there's a kind of, there's a part of me thinking well, you know, I really don't know a lot about Sean's world and like when he was a kid, obviously I did, you know he babbled away to me and I knew who his friends were and what games he's playing in and what his latest obsession was and all of his world was part of my world. So you know, I don't, there's a part of me that feels like I don't know if I could do it but it would be kind of nice if I could find some way of kind of connecting up with him. 

00:31:00
LOUISE So you want to find a way to connect with your son again. 

00:31:05
MARY I would, yea that would be, yea, I mean when you say that again, that is what I want. That is what I want. I want to connect with him. I want to, I want to feel like he's my son again rather than the enemy, you know. 'Cause a lot of the time that's what I'm saying. The arguments in the room before we get there. It's like we just instantly get into this row the second we set eyes on each other. 

00:31:30
LOUISE All right, so the rows start the moment you get together. 

00:31:30
MARY Absolutely, yea. The second, I mean, just like this morning's typical. I mean, he walks in the door and that's it, we're into it. We're into argument, we're into this like, you know it's like an all-out war, and that's the bit that's left me going. I really can't take this anymore. 

00:31:50
LOUISE I'm just wondering if there's anything that um, might help that to change. 

00:32:05
MARY Well 

00:32:10
LOUISE You spoke about the two worlds being so separate. I'm wondering how the two worlds might, might meet in a different way. 

00:32:20
MARY I mean I don't know how to, how to join them up. I guess there's a part of me kind of thinking well, you know, maybe if there's some way of kind of resisting the argument or some way of kind of trying to find out like how does he see it because I know that the fact that I'm very worried and very anxious, and kind of like, you know, I'm on his case so if there's like maybe, I don't know, there is a part of going, well I can only go and sort of see if there a way of finding a road through to him and I go, I guess you know in the time that I've talked to you, I've recognized that that, you know, I've gone from kind of feeling like there's nothing I can do to kind of going well, I could have a go. I don't know if it'll work, but I can have a go at sort of trying something a bit different with him. 

00:33:15
LOUISE What, what do you mean by you're always on his case? 

00:33:20
MARY Well, basically, as I say, I am, it does me, you know I do think he should be doing something with his life. I do think he needs to be taking some responsibility. I think he should go on in education, you know, I mean I, you know, I basically just find it extremely difficult that he just like lies around the place all the time listening to music and thinks that that's all right and that that's what grown-ups do. It's like it's not what grown-ups do. So there's a part of me feels a bit like I would you know, I don't know, it's like I'm back with that when I'm saying all that, I'm back with the frustration of it, and there is a kind of like, I know there's some way in which I have to kind of like stop kind of always coming at him from that place of frustration. That's what I feel after talking to you is that I have to find some way of having a different approach, and you know I don't know. I'm kind of amazed at how much a difference it makes that you've listened to me the way you've listened to me, you know, and I don't know, I just I'll try and see if I can find out a bit about his world. 

00:34:35
LOUISE Right. So, what I understand is that you might listen to him differently or find out what his world is like for him. 

00:34:45
MARY Well, yea, that, I mean but it's like, it, it's something about him and I guess there's a part of me feels like to actually kind of say, to go into a room and kind of not instantly engage in battle would be a big change and even when I go to say that, I know how hard I'm going to find that to do. But you know, I can only, I can't but try and you, you know, what we've, you know what I've got from you is, is like yea, if I have a go, if I try and listen and find out a little bit about him, then maybe that's how I can connect with him again, 'cause I have, I mean that connection, that sense of being connected with each other is like long since gone. You know it's like, it's just like it's an endless battle of wills. And we're always locked into it and it's tiring. It's very tiring. Yea. 

00:35:45
LOUISE Mary, over the past few minutes or half an hour, I've heard you say that you felt really distressed by the way your son is at home, that you've been so agitated you've not been able to work here effectively. You've not been able to concentrate, that at home you feel quite powerless to change things, that there are two different worlds. There his world and there's yours, although you live in the same space. And then finally you've just talked about the possibility of trying to understand, understand his world. Um, that's quite a big order. You know, a lot of expectation to, to do that, a lot of, it'll take a lot of courage and a lot of patience. We're going to have to close because mainly the half an hour is up, but I wonder whether you might like to come back and talk to me again at another time, when you've had time to see what happens at work and what happens at home. 

00:37:10
MARY That would be great, yea. I mean, it's been amazingly helpful to talk to you, Louise. And I feel quite different than I did when I walked into the room. Thank you very much, yea. That would be great. 

00:37:25
LOUISE Well, that'll be fine. Anytime. 

00:37:25
MARY Okay, thank you. 

00:37:35
MAUREEN MOORE In this scene, Mary is able to express her feelings clearly, and she does so quite vividly, so vividly that I also experience some of the feelings that she's expressing. I share this with her because to hold it back and not let Mary know that I too share something of what she's experiencing could deprive Mary of a sense of being okay and being really understood. In order to move things forward, I use open questions and clarifying questions to really help Mary to focus on what she wants and how she feels, now as we end the session. I also use her words for example, being on his case. I could guess at what she meant by that, but by asking Mary to clarify what she meant, she was able to see what she was doing every time she met her son. Before ending, Mary suggested that she had gained a lot from being listened to, and that perhaps she might take something of this experience back to her relationship with her son, and it might help to make a difference. I summarized what had happened during the session, and Mary seemed to think that that was okay and fine. And I also invited her to come back if she wanted to and to talk about what had happened subsequently so that she could perhaps feel very happy and share her happiness and success or make further inquiry into how she might cope with the difficulties that she exper-, that she continues to have with her son. I wonder if you could think about Mary's experience of being listened to and being heard. And think about whether or not anything that she has experienced might be helpful to her in her relationship with her son.

Scene 5: Mary listens to her son. 

00:40:50
MARY Do you want a cup of tea, Sean? 

00:40:55
SEAN Um, yea. Um, four sugars please. 

00:41:05
MARY There you are. Well, that was a bit of a scene we had this morning. 

00:41:15
SEAN You can say that again. 

00:41:15
MARY Well, I, I had this conversation with a woman at work, and I just, I realize that I would like us to be able to get on better and 

00:41:30
SEAN What's that going to change? 

00:41:35
MARY Well, we used to, we used to be friends, Sean. You know, I realize that you know, well I just wanted to just try and work out how to talk you a bit better I guess. 

00:41:45
SEAN Well you could start by talking and not nagging. 

00:41:50
MARY Well, and that, that's what I'm trying to do now. So, so what sort of a day did you have? 

00:42:00
SEAN All right I guess. I just went out with the boys and we been rehearsing for, we're playing a gig this weekend at um, Rising Sun, the Rising Sun down the road. 

00:42:15
MARY Oh are you? Oh, well, does that, does that pay any, anything? 

00:42:20
SEAN Well, we get free booze and then they kind of give us 20 quid or something like that. So not really but, you know, I don't do it for the money. I do it for the music really. 

00:42:30
MARY Yea, yea, I can see that the music means a lot to you. 

00:42:35
SEAN Yea, it's my life. It's everything. I mean, what would I be without music. 

00:42:45
MARY Well, I just, I, I do worry about you, Sean, you know. I worry about what you're going to do and how you're going to survive. 

00:42:50
SEAN I'm surviving fine, aren't I? 

00:42:55
MARY Well, you're still very dependent on me to, to kind of provide for you and you know, anyway, I just, as I say, I don't want to fall out with you. I just want to kind of work out how to, how to get on with you better some. 

00:43:10
SEAN Well, if you could start by like just stop, I don't know it's just, try liking even one thing that I do. It's just like everything I do seems to be wrong. Everything I do you seem to find a fault with it or somewhere that I can't do it right or it's going to lead to something wrong or it's just, it's nonstop. 

00:43:35
MARY Well, I'm, I'm sorry you feel like that and it certainly, I am, I am anxious about you but I don't think that everything you do is wrong, Sean. 

00:43:45
SEAN Well, that's the way it feels. 

00:43:45
MARY Well, I, I, I mean I, I certainly would certainly like you to know that even if I do come across like that, that's not what I really think. I just, you know, really I'd like us to be friends again, and I'd like us to work out how to get on like we used to get on. 

00:44:05
SEAN Well, I mean look, one thing for example. I don't mind that you don't like my music but you've never even tried liking it. 

00:44:10
MARY Well, I, you know, maybe, maybe I could come along and see what you do. At least I'd see that other people enjoy it. Just you know, if that would be okay. 

00:44:25
SEAN You want to come along to the gig on Saturday? 

00:44:25
MARY Yea. 

00:44:30
SEAN Yea I guess, I guess you could come. 

00:44:30
MARY Yea, yea we can start with that and then I, I do want to make an effort, Sean, and I do, I do. You know, you really matter to me, and, and you know, I just, I don't know how we're going to manage to get on differently but I'd like us to start. So that, that's a place to start isn't it? 

00:44:50
SEAN Yea, yea, I guess. 

00:44:50
MARY Right okay, well we'll, we'll do that on Saturday though.
